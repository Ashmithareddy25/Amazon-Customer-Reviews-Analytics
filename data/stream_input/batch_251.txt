B000002AGM|5.0|I've owned this album for five years and still listen to it on a regular basis.  Miles plays flugelhorn with a 19-piece orchestra and creates some of the warmest, most lyrical solos he ever made.  The arrangements by Gil Evans are also excellent, and coincide perfectly with the signature tone of Miles.  Also, having a great bass-drum combination like Paul Chambers and Art Taylor definitely doesn't hurt.  There actually is no pianist although Gil Evans plays a few stray chords every now and then.  On this record, Miles is the only real soloist, unlike his other works with Gil Evans such as Birth Of The Cool and Sketches Of Spain, where other players take the opportunity to take the stage as well.  Instead, the orchestra members, rather than soloing for themselves, back-up and support Miles.  One of the orchestra's trumpet players, John Carisi, penned &quot;Springsville&quot; for Miles which was a great decision turning into the best flugelhorn-feature recorded.  Miles blows effortlessly through the lower and upper registers while everyone else is in top form.  &quot;The Maids Of Cadiz&quot; is actually a Spanish classical piece, although Miles adds some jazz to it in his soloing.  The feeling is very serious and well-presented.  The flugelhorn is perfect for a piece like this, because it gives a slightly darker sound which fits naturally with the feeling intended.  &quot;The Duke&quot; is more of a showcase for the orchestra although Miles plays a nice little solo in between and joins them for the theme.  This Dave Brubeck composition has a more laid-back feel to it, reminiscent of the cool jazz Miles played on Birth Of The Cool and the West Coast jazz played in the 1950's.  &quot;My Ship&quot; is an Ira Gershwin-Kurt Weill tune that even has triangles in the beginning.  The tune is beautiful, especially the way Miles plays it with the band backing him up.  The flute-percussion introduction slides smoothly into &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, the only Miles Davis composition on the album.  This time the tune is laid-back and happy.  His solo on this track is superb as it builds up both technically and creatively as he continues on.  &quot;Blues For Pablo&quot;, a Gil Evans piece, is definitely the most complex and dense piece here.  It has Miles trading slow, somber melodies with the orchestra, once again with a Spanish-tinge.  The ending and beginning are extremely similar, both starting out with Miles playing a serious cadenza and then getting a short response from the brass.  &quot;New Rhumba&quot; is a happy, up-tempo piece which has Miles and the brass playing, and then stopping for the bass to play a short back-up part.  The tune is structured completely around Davis soloing which is good.  The tune was written by Ahmad Jamal, who Miles admired for his laid-back piano playing.  &quot;The Meaning Of The Blues&quot; is a short solo song for Davis at an extremely slow tempo, then moving directly into the J.J. Johnson composition &quot;Lament&quot;, which is a beautiful track showing how much emotion Miles can put into just one phrase.  The final track, the quick and complex &quot;I Don't Wanna Be Kissed (By Anyone But You)&quot; is a tricky piece with Miles playing the fast theme and the orchestra responding back.  This is a great way to end the album, especially when Miles blasts out a high B at the end and then the brass section holds out a double-A, ending the album on a high note, literally.<br />This is an essential effort by Miles and Gil Evans.  I don't recommend the remaster (the one with the orange and red on the cover) because the remastering is horrible and the brass comes out sounding weak because the woodwinds were too loudly recorded, which makes the recording much less pleasureable.  Get the blue and yellow colored album which is impeccable sound and has the classic as it should be heard.
B00003CXXO|2.0|Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the opening scenes occur in New Jersey? How come the Garden State is dry as a bone while New York City is almost totally submerged? Well, never mind...<BR>The overblown plot involving the search of a \\"humanized\\" robot for his imagined Mother is too much to bear. David, played by Haley Joel Osment, is programmed to be able to feel love by his human Mother, who is forced to cast off the partly human Son when the fully human Son is resussitated.<BR>The movie would have been better if David searched for the Monica Swinton character and not the Blue Fairy. Then the positive message would be that a Mother's Love is what makes us *truly* human. That without Love we might as well *be* mechanical. Instead we get the horribly violent scene in an arena where old robots are thrown to the lions, actually a wrecking ball if memory serves. Ofcourse it's symbolic but it's also obvious and unnecessary - just like the many typical close-ups of the child star with a vacant expression.
B000002I53|5.0|John Coltrane was a man who completely turned himself around as both a person and a musician.  He matured dramatically through the mid-to-late fifties, getting off drugs, making great music and finding faith in God.  My Favorite Things is a great example of Coltrane expressing himself in a totally new way.  This album is definitely up there with Giant Steps, Impressions and A Love Supreme.  It also shows some of the first hints of his famous quartet, as McCoy Tyner joins for piano and Elvin Jones is on drums.  Coltrane also makes some of his first experiments with the soprano saxophone, an instrument he would go on to make all his own.  This album, along with releases like Ole` Coltrane and Impressions, opened up completely new doors for Coltrane's musical directions.  Ornette Coleman first started playing \\"free jazz\\" around 1960, when this album was released, and there is definitely an influence from that style, noticeably in \\"Summertime\\" and \\"But Not For Me\\", two standards in which are harmonically and rhythmically twisted into free, constantly changing tempos.  While many jazz musicians tried this technique and failed, Coltrane handles it with ease.  However, the album's most beautiful moments are on the Cole Porter (the same man who wrote \\"All Of You\\" and \\"Love For Sale\\") ballad \\"Everytime We Say Goodbye\\".  Here, Coltrane executes brilliant tones of emotion while Tyner backs him up tastefully.  The whole feeling of this song is amazing and shows they are first-class musicians.  Of course, the album would never be complete without the beautiful classic \\"My Favorite Things\\", in which Coltrane does some of his most excellent and creative playing.  Tyner takes a long, melodic solo.  Perhaps the most impressive part of the title track is the display of improvisational skill.  They always know exactly where they are in the melody which makes everything swing smoothly.  Coltrane's virtuosic soprano sax statements go perfectly with McCoy's lyrical piano style.  This special re-issue also includes two short alternate takes of \\"My Favorite Things\\", which are a nice addition to the album.  It's nice to hear other versions of the song that were recorded and compare them to the released version.  However, the alternates are both extremely short compared to the 13-minute final version.  This is some of Coltrane's best work, and should be bought immediately by anyone who enjoys saxophone, abstract jazz, or just Coltrane in general.  This album is more than just a classic jazz album.  Coltrane adds an artistic side to it, making it almost like a painting.  Even on the rare occasions when he makes a mistake, it even helps the music.  It's a splatter on the canvas which actually makes the music even better.  Coltrane was truly a blessed soul, and this is a classic.
B000069HP6|3.0|After the success of Star Wars and Star Trek: The Motion Picture, many studios were clamoring for movies that dealt with this re-energized genre of space operas.  With many live action classic romps under its belt including 20,000 Under The Sea, who better than Disney to bring a great tale to a family audience.<br />Enter 'The Black Hole', Disney's 1979 entrance to Sci-Fi. I remember watching this as a boy when it hit the theatre and was excited to get the DVD, mostly for nostalgia reasons, and re-living what I consider a great 'story'.  But after watching this DVD I had mixed emotions.<br />On the pro side, I was thrilled to take part in viewing this once again, and was reminded why The Black Hole stuck with me all these years, even after other more popular and big-budgeted action space action thrillers came and went (ex: Krull, Battle Beyond the Stars)...it was the story.  Sure there was some flat dialogue, and some plot struggles, but overall it was a pure space fantasy movie.  A small group of explorers and their sidekick robot, Vincent (Disney's hybrid version of R2-D2 and C-3PO), are on an exploratory mission of uncharted space when they discover a black hole.  Upon investigation they discover the USS Cygnus, a very large space carrier thought to have been lost many years ago along with its crew.  Our explorers soon discover that the Cygnus is still inhabited after all these years, by a lone surviving scientist and his very imposing robot, Maximillian (painted devil red).  Other robots and faceless androids are on board, and soon our explorers uncover a more sinister plot.  Our lone scientist has gone slightly mad, will not let our explorers leave the ship, the crew never abandoned ship as first explained, and now our scientist wants to take the Cygnus through the black hole to the other side, perhaps to become a god himself.<br />Throughout the story, we are given clues to what is really happening, and the surprise revelations towards the climax are reminiscent of what Rod Serling may have wrote.  All in all a good family adventure, without too much violence (it is implied however,...this is Disney), no swearing, nice large sets and a good diversity of characters.<br />The cons: Even after the success of Star Wars and Star Trek, it seems Disney rushed this movie to completion with little money spent on special effects.  Though the movie was made in '79, it looks as if it was made way before Star Wars or Trek just on the camp value alone.  At times it reminded me of the 60's TV series Lost in Space, or the original Disney 20,000 Leagues.  Also, it is quite apparent that the lasers are pure animation as are their affects, some of the sets though large look cheap, lighting and fog machines are used in situations that are kinda atrocious, and probably my biggest complaint: you can SEE all the wires holding the robots in just about every scene.  That in itself is unforgivable given the fact other movies at that time and movie making techniques were advanced enough to hide them.<br />I do not believe the transfer was re-mastered.  Throughout the movie there is noticeable frame flecks and graininess at times.  The sound does not appear to be enhanced either so I'd say the over all quality is no better than the original VHS release.  There are also virtually no extras: 1 theatrical trailer and a very boring picture gallery.  All this gallery contains is scanned production shots and numerous variations of release posters.  Nothing too much to really wow the viewer.  Considering this is sorta a cult classic film some interviews or production notes are a no-brainer, but sadly not included.<br />Hate to sound too negative here, but it is a must for your collection if you enjoy good science fiction stories and can safely share this with you family.nt of what Rod Serling may have wrote.

B0000640VO|5.0|Dear Monsieur:<br />Shame on you!  You have made me cry!  I do not cry at love stories as a rule--until tonight AND the night before!  Perhaps it is because I am also a girl who did not have many playmates;  perhaps it is because I am a girl with rather peculiar parents.  Perhaps the girl with the glass resembles me just a touch too much.<BR>Alas, all this is true.<BR>But I think the true reason for my tears is this:<BR>1.  It is about time that garden gnomes got to see the world.<BR>2.  It is about time everyone had their portraits taken in photo booths. <BR>3.  It is about time everyone learned to skip stones.<BR>4.  And most importantly, it is about time to love small things.  For this must surely be the direction toward small miracles.<BR>5.  And finally.  Your film is not a small miracle.<BR>It is a giant one.<BR>Love, Zorro
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is just a fun CD to listen to. Gwen sounds great. I like this much more than previous work. A great collection of different song styles. The radio waves have played enough of Hey Baby and Hella Good to give everyone a sample. There is a at least three others on this recording that should make it on radio also: Making Out, Running, and Waiting Room. The only \\"weak\\" songs to me are Rock Steady and Ric Ocasek productions. I never was much of a Cars fan though, and I can hear it in the guitars. Definitely a buy.
B00000F169|5.0|...but if you've got that certain strange *kink* in your sense of humor, the one that makes you love Douglas Adams, no-budget monster flicks, bizarre midnight matinees, etc. you just might love this.  Some people claim that it's slow...and if you aren't receptive to this sort of dead-pan ridiculous humor, then I guess it is.  But if you appreciate the thought of 3 spaced-out losers drifting forgotten in space, looking for planets to blow up just to kill the boredom, smoking cigarettes and discussing philosophy with tempermental \\"smart\\" bombs...it makes a fun evening.<br />I say, \\"Cool!\\"
B00004TRD8|5.0|This movie is definitely the best I've ever seen.  I remember watching it the first time on video and I loved it.  I bought the ultimate dvd and was amazed of how many extra scenes there were added in.  It was like a completely new movie.  A lot of scenes left out explained the story better.  For example:  In the original T2 you saw John choose between his mother and the liquid terminator disguised as his mother and he chooses right, but you never see in the regular movie that the liquid terminator is damaged and starts to change to the color of whatever he touches.  Don't worry that little scene won't ruin the movie for you it's just an example.  The movie without the ultimate DVD was already a masterpiece, and with the added scenes it was the best!  I never get tired of watching this movie over and over again.  It's just that good.  Definitely, Arnold Schwarsenagger's best movie.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This CD is probably one of my favorites of all time.  It's one of those CDs that you can listen to over and over and not get sick of the songs.  The thing that surprises me the most is that this CD isn't that recognized.  I'm not normally into the really \\"musicy\\" part of the song, but I love some of those guitar parts.  EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS CD.  I don't understand why you wouldn't like this CD.  Everyone I know loves it, so BUY IT!!
0316666343|5.0|It's been some time since a book has so captured my attention and affection. Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is remarkable and poignant, and a book I will not soon forget. Susie Salmon's perspective made me laugh and cry, and the optimism she sparked, even through her death, is contagious as a reader and witness to her world. I highly recommend this book; you will not be disappointed.
0316666343|5.0|Treat yourself to a heartwarming and tender novel.  I loved it.
B000006NPY|5.0|Once upon a time, Billy Corgan stood on a stage backed by a wall of sound, wearing a Zero t-shirt, silver pants, and using his guitar to put out blistering solos.  Oh yes, and who could forget the man's unique, nasal voice?  <br />However, Corgan seemed to change towards the end of his Mellon Collie tour.  Faced with enough drama to create a season's worth of Behind the Music, Billy Corgan began to warn fans that Mellon Collie and The Inifinite Sadness (the band's biggest album) was the end of an era.  <br />After three years of waiting, we were given the beginning of a new era for The Smashing Pumpkins....Adore.<br />Adore fell short of Mellon Collie on sales (not surprisingly) and also fell short with a lot of fans.  However, I believe that this album actually seperated the true fans of the band from the people who were in it for \\"that rat in a cage song.\\"<br />Adore is a much more subdued album.  Corgan takes on a different position as a songwriter.  Instead of relishing in his troubled past as he did with previous albums,  (Remember, this man wrote the line \\"I'm in love with my sadness.\\") Corgan begins to come to terms with it.  The death of his mother, Martha, greatly influences this album...supplying us with two of the better songs on it.  (\\"Once Upon a Time\\" and the absolutely beautiful \\"For Martha.\\")<br />A lot of people don't care very much for the latter day Smashing Pumpkins, however I find them to be far more intriguing than the angry rock band of old.  <br />The driving guitars of Siamese Dream do make a very brief return in \\"For Martha\\", however they manage to fit in perfectly with the song.<br />The Smashing Pumpkins are unfairly labeled as a grunge band.  However, now that their illustrious career has come to an end, perhaps they will get some of the credit that they rightfully deserve with their final albums.<br />I highly recommend Adore to anyone who wishes to experience the evolution of a band.
B000000WA2|5.0|I don't care about Oasis. Blur were the undisputed kings of the Brit-pop wars. Long after the wars ended, Blur put out two excellent albums(self-titled and 13). The Great Escape is exactly what it says, Blur escaping from Brit-pop for a new musical direction, and that means even being called sellouts for doing it.<br />Great Escape is less of a sequel to Parklife as it is an expansion on Modern Life is Rubbish. Taking the orchestrated sound of MLIR and expanding it to an even larger heights. The sound is propelled even more by horns and strings then the forementioned album. The result is a lush, melodically solid album. Not a huge leap forward in sound, but more of refininment. It's not a bad thing since the songs still sound fresh and exciting.<br />Even with the help of classical instruments, Blur still makes sure that they are the core of the sound. Albarn's vocals are still amazing, mixed in with a dark yet humorous wit. Not to mention he still plays a plethora of instruments as usual. Coxon plays some absolutely bizarre riffs complemented by Roundtree's standard time keeping drumming and James's bass playing. The songwriting is the real star of the album. Composition has always been a star point of Blur and TGE doesn't disapoint. Infact, I would go as far as to say that this is their most musically intricate work to date. So many layers and textures to listen to/for that this album has tons of replay value. Also, Albarn's lyrics have a certain subtitle bite to them, poking fun of modern day life in a way that only he can.<br />This is certainly a CD that cannot be missed. I understand why they decided to change musical directions. Some say that Great Escape painted them into a corner in which they needed to get out of. I think its more of an ode to a musical sound that they needed a change from. For that, I can't recommend this album enough.
B000000WA4|5.0|Where do you begin with this album?  <br />Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness is a testament to the greatness of The Smashing Pumpkins.  Not only did they step out of the shadow of Kurt Cobain, they made his band look like nothing more than a garage band from Seattle.  <br />The Pumpkins were truly a great band to witness.  With every album, they became more mature.  With this album, they achieved a sense of dignity that most rock and roll bands can never reach.  From the amazing structure of the songs (Corgan never settles for anything simple) to the deeply personal (and absolutely brilliant) lyrics, Mellon Collie is an experience to behold.  That's right, it isn't just an album.  It is a true experience.  <br />Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness is perhaps the best album of the 90s.  It was the beginning of the evolution of, in my opinion, the greatest band of all time.  Anyone who appreciates music can certainly see how this album led into Adore, and ultimately into their final masteripiece, Machina/the machines of God.  (I highly recommend purchasing those other two albums along with this.)<br />-Meanie
B000003TAL|5.0|i bought this orignally on cassette when i was in college way back in the late 80's, and i am still loving it.  every song is amazing.  the depth and sophistication of the album is extensive meaning you don't get sick of DN or burn out.  SY are great musicians.  Plus, i think this album is more accessible than sister or evol (if you haven't done so yet, check these out).  if you've never listened to SY, get DN first.
6305165912|5.0|Probably my favorite movie of all time. Big Lebowski is enjoyable on every level. It's a great comedy, it's social commentary on SoCal, and of course, as with all Cohen Bros. films, you can find a nigh-metaphysical layer of import if you look deep enough. If you haven't seen it, you have to check it out.
B000002AS3|5.0|Next to Guns n' Roses \\"Appetitite For Destruction\\", one of the greatest debut rock albums. <BR>Killer songs with magnificent guitar riffs.  <BR>It is like the Sex Pistols mixed with the Beatles.
6305499365|5.0|I was skeptical when I was invited to see this movie at the theatre, figuring all the funny bits were contained in the trailer and the tv ads.  I was sorely mistaken.  This is absolutely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, basically because I can, like many of you all, identify with one or more of the scenarios (e.g. the copier from hell, the commute that never seems to end, the obsession some people have about their office supplies).  And I never thought the &quot;oh face&quot; would be an icebreaker in conversation but trust me, it is!<br />Oh yes, Michael Herman is the coolest actor there is!  Watch him in Dude, Where's My Car? as well.  He's hot!

B000069HKH|5.0|Much has been written but let me say this. The Rising is more than I had hoped for. One of the best albums of the year. It deserves a Grammy. Now, of course, the music and the lyrics must be considered separately in any review and these lyrics are balanced between being universal and specific. They give us various glimpses of loss, confusion, anger, hope, faith, love, and affirmation that can only be shown by those who have been tested by fire. And the music is enormously satisfying - elements of the old and new styles. This is not Bruce rolling back the clock or repeating himself. I don't want him to! This album will stand the test of time. There are stories of great pain and loss in The Rising, but there is joy, and hope, and possibility, too. Above all, there is a way forward and reason to go on in everyday life.
0451191153|5.0|A brilliant exposition via novel format; the struggles and triumphs of a self-disciplined, honest, devoted genius, who maintains his self-respect and integrity in spite of relentless assaults from those who would take what they have not created.<br />The message is timely for us; we live in the age of denial of responsibility, when too many people seek to play the victim of circumstances rather than achieving in life. Even though communism is thought to be dead, there are still many people who would like to get something of value only because they \\"need\\" it rather than earning it. We advance as a free people because of the worth of the individual, and his achievments.<br />Now try this one: you decide to hire an architect for your dream home. Would you like Howard Roark to take on the job? Even if you disagree with Ayn Rand, a man such as Howard is going to do a fine job. Triumph of the individual again.<br />A great read and re-read, don't miss it!!!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I've been reading the reviews of this album by fanatics and I can't understand what the commotion is about. It's a #1s album, they didn't say these were the best or the deepest songs, just the ones that were number 1. Got it? Obviously, if you're a huge fan, you have all their albums. This is obviously a gift to people who are casual Beatles fans familiar with their main hits and for a new generation like myself to become acquainted with them. If you're mad because your favorite songs were not on here, you're missing the point of this particular compilation. This was not a conspiracy to exclude anyone's favorite songs or to \\"promote\\" Paul's repertoire as one person stated. Please read the cover and book. It says #1s. They had no more than 28 (+ Please Please Me)#1 hits. Strawberry Fields, the entirity of Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper's Album etc. were not #1s songwise but contained great songs. This was an objective compilation, not a subjective one. Paul happens to have more songs on there because they were among the most popular. People need to stop with all these conspiracy theories about this album. If you have all their albums already then don't buy it. These reviews seem more about personal disppointment over favorite songs omitted than actual problems with the songs themselves. There are a lot of good songs here and no maybe they're not all their \\"best\\", but this is about popularity. It's a place to start and it's a commemorative of the Beatles influence on popular culture.
B000069HKH|2.0|I spent the weekend listening to \\"The Rising\\" and gave it one more shot in the car on the way in to work. Bad decision on a Monday--there's enough doom and gloom on the world news report without adding these songs to the mix. <br />My epiphany came from reading the reviewer's comment that a 9/11 victim asked the Boss where he was--he was needed now. So *that's* why it sounds forced--Springsteen felt compelled to present his commentary on the tragedy. Speaking as Everyman, and as Everyfireman, Every-significant-other-who-didn't-come-home, Everyvictim--ok, Bruce. Got it! But where's the depth, where's the music, where's the E-Street Band?<br />If I want to relive 9/11, I can watch any of the programs taped from TV over the last year. Spirit of nationalism as translated into music? Springsteen's \\"My City of Ruins\\" along with the other artists who joined together in concert. <br />When I buy a CD, I want a collection of music that is a companion to driving/kicking back/working around the house. Not something that sends me looking for the Paxil. Thanks, Bruce. We still need you.
B00000G09Q|3.0|Whether or not this movie should be considered better or worse than the first two depends greatly on what you want to get out of it.  The facts are as follows:  1) it deviates severely from the &quot;traditional&quot; plot line (ie. Turtles vs. Shredder).  2) The turtles' characters are (comparatively) more mature and have thus ceased to act like 15 year-olds.  3) The fight scenes are very enjoyable, much more so than in the first movie, because they are well lit and you can really appreciate the artistry of the choreography.  Personally, I enjoyed seeing how the characters had matured and developed.  Each turtle's personality is much more distinct in this movie.  They are individuals now rather than a group of adjective-yelling adolescents. Basically, this movie is different from the first two, so if you aren't willing to try something new, don't see it.  But if you liked the turtles for themselves and not just their image, give it a try.
B00006AVRK|4.0|The first two seasons are the truest to Wodehouse's style.  The plots and dialogue come directly from the Wodehouse stories.<BR>The following seasons take quite a bit of poetic license but are still fun to watch.<BR>There's some substituting of  supporting characters (for instance, Stiffy Byng instead of Catsmeat's sister Corky) so folks won't get confused trying to keep up with all the names (it doesn't detract from the story).  Many minor and some major characters are left out to simplify the plots; and for some reason Sir Roderick Glossop is given a wife, which he never had in the books.<BR>Still, taken all in all, not a bad way to spend an evening.  Oh, and the music is terrific :-).
0800141660|4.0|It is an excellent movie but it would've been better with different cast. The story was very good in the sense that you wanted to know what would happen next. I saw this dvd and I will try and get it to own it. I will put it with my favorite DVDs.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Among all the chaotic anger in the music industry that so many bigoted, so-called &quot;appreciators of music&quot; are defining as prose, it's nice to see a light in the darkness like John Mayer.  On first picking this CD up, I noticed something interesting about the lyrics.  They all seemed to remind me of poems that a third grader would be proud of and would make his parents display them on the refrigerator.  However, on closer inspection, you can't help but smile, especially when you hear them sung.  The songs on this CD, namely &quot;83&quot; &quot;No Such Thing&quot; &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; and &quot;Why Georgia&quot; are nothing but quiet reminiscence on the past, quiet reminisence that has more genius in it than many will give it credit for.  So many times in music, it has been proven that the soft-spoken usually have the most depth, and John Mayer proves that time and again on this CD.  His poetry deals with dealing with growing up, heartbreak, transition into the real world, and the quiet laughter we all enjoyed when we were kids.  If you are heading off to college or are almost finished with high school, this CD will truly speak to you, more than any other CD has.  <br />The music is great, the lyrics really are poetic, and the messages are simple but complex.  Genius.  Too bad there aren't very many artists that can match up to it.
B00000JRTX|5.0|What does one's natural life consist of?  You're born, you get married, you die.  Weddings and funerals (and what happens during weddings and funerals) thus have special significance and meaning--so much so that this movie skips everything in between such as work and weekends and nevertheless manages to paint a lively and detailed portrait of a network of family and friendship, romance and relationship.<br />Four Weddings and a Funeral is set in the \\"best parts\\" of the U.K. and thus technically qualifies as a \\"foreign\\" flick even though it's in English and probably made with an American audience in mind.  It stars Hugh Grant as the very eligible but slightly bumbling bachelor, and Andie McDowell as the more forward American with the engaging smile.  They seem to have been made for their respective roles.  This movie was a real treat for me.  Prior to watching this, I was lamenting that there hadn't been a good romantic comedy since \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" . . . .
B00005NTNU|3.0|This box set contains all five of Clint Eastwood's films in the  \\"Dirty Harry\\" series (1971-1988 ). Given the tremendous popularity of the eponymous 1971 classic, it is hardly surprising that Warner Brothers would commission a line of sequels. It is clear that \\"DIRTY HARRY\\" stands on its own as one of the best action films ever made and easily merits a five star rating. The sequels ( a Dirty Harry \\"franchise\\" ), while drawing on the original for their frame of reference, have nowhere near the same power and focus as the original.<br />The following sets forth brief descriptions of the four sequels ( the review for the original appears in the 30th anniversary DVD edition  \\"DIRTY HARRY\\" ).<br />MAGNUM FORCE ( 1973 ) is interesting chiefly for the interplay between Callahan and Lt Briggs ( played by Hal Halbrook ).There is, as one would expect, a lot of action but of a routine and disconnected nature, fulfilling the bare minimum required by the genre but notably lacking the creative direction Don Siegel furnished in the original. The main plot ( part of the double meaning of the title ) involves a secret \\"death squad\\" functioning within the police department; interestingly, the storyline appears to have been developed as a counter to accusations ( made by the cultural left ) that the first film was \\"fascistic\\". Eastwood's charisma and a few good lines notwithstanding, the film runs on for far too long to little effect. TWO-STAR RATING.<br />THE ENFORCER ( 1976 ) is the worst of the entire DH series, containing a ridiculous plot centering on underground revolutionary criminals ( modeled on the SLA ) with the subplot focused on the bantering exchanges between Callahan and his ( female ) partner ( played by Tyne Daly ). The cheesy \\"jazz\\" score that drones on through the center of the film is extremely irritating and while Eastwood has a few good scenes, interest is not sustained. The final 10 minutes ( location shooting on Alcatraz Island ) is worth a look but all in all this movie does not repay the effort of watching it. ONE-STAR RATING.<br />SUDDEN IMPACT ( 1983 ) is the only Dirty Harry film directed by Eastwood and easily the best of the sequels. Several aspects set this film apart from the others:<br />1. The plot has some real substance, Sandra Locke giving a good performance as a successful artist who, haunted by the gang rape she and her sister suffered a decade earlier, stumbles upon one of the ( never punished ) thugs and sets out on a course of revenge against all the perpetrators.<br />2. The cinematography is excellent with Eastwood drawing upon his considerable directorial abilities. There is a convincing symmetry to the opening and closing titles ( beautiful overhead shots of nighttime San Francisco and an early morning overview of the Santa Cruz beachfront ). Several scenes ( Locke trapped in tormented reminiscence ) feature camera work drawing on a moodiness redolent of film-noir. There is also a nice daytime shot of Inspector Callahan looking over cliff-side crime scene, the entire length of the Golden Gate Bridge stretched out in a distant background.<br />3. Eastwood ( having aged nicely in the 12 year interim between the original film ) brings more fire to his characterization than he had in the other sequels; seething sarcasm in his verbal confrontations with department officials and a ruthless, stone-cold application of force toward the repulsive criminals ( the villains are particularly well-portrayed ).<br />4. Lalo Schifrin' music score is the best since his work on the original.<br />Drawbacks? There are a few unnecessary action sequences which mar the otherwise unusually ( for the series ) focused storyline. FOUR-STAR RATING.<br />THE DEAD POOL ( 1988 ) is last film in the series and is certainly the most unorthodox of the sequels. Eastwood had obviously tired of the character and signed off on a script that allowed him to integrate two subplot themes that actually \\"trump\\" the ( superficial ) main storyline.<br />1. A satirical edge ( most apparent in its parody of the famous car chase in \\"BULLITT\\" ).<br />2. An indictment of both sensationalistic TV journalism and the narcissistic \\"cult\\" of celebrity prevalent in modern America.<br />The main storyline is fairly absurd and the action scenes are woodenly routine  ( mob shootouts and diner robberies ) but Eastwood still looks and talks the part of Harry Callahan, with some good verbal jousts with an attractive television reporter and an arrogant schlock movie director ( played by Liam Neeson ). A young Jim Carrey plays the part of a drug addicted rock star.<br />As one would expect, the movie makes extensive use of location shooting in ever-photogenic San Francisco but nothing other than mere competency is achieved. All in all, it is clear that the well had run dry and Eastwood ( sensibly enough ) had some tongue-in-cheek fun with this, the last shot Harry Callahan fired. TWO-STAR RATING.<br />In conclusion: this box set is an obligatory purchase for Dirty Harry fans as well as for diehard Clint Eastwood \\"completists\\". For less dedicated viewers, the original \\"Dirty Harry\\" is very highly recommended with \\"Sudden Impact\\" as an enjoyably distant second choice.ine.<br />1.

B00005JKQZ|5.0|There is something beautiful about the way in which an incredibly intelligent mind processes information, and thanks to a fine performance by Russell Crowe as real-life mathematician John Nash, this movie succeeds in capturing it.  It's also nice to see scenes from Princeton, which was my &quot;dream school&quot; when I was back in high school.  It should also be added that Jennifer Connelly won best supporting actress for playing the protagonist's best supporting spouse.  Without giving the plot away, let me just warn you though that despite the beautiful wife, Mr. Nash's life was less than beautiful in all its parts.  See the movie.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|Memento is an absolutely thrilling movie based on an original screenplay written by Christopher Nolan.  Memento (Latin for \\"Remember\\"), told in a clever backward/forward reverse sequence in 10-minute or so segments, exemplifies quiet brilliance in a completely innovative style that replicates the confusing sequences viewed from the perspective of the main character (Guy Pearce).<br />Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby who witnesses his wife's rape and murder and in the process, loses his ability to retain short-term memories.  From hereon end, Shelby is intent on avenging his wife's death - but he's hampered through his inability to retain any knowledge and relies solely on tattoos and Polaroid photos to ensure the \\"truth\\".   <br />From the opening scenes where a gun is fired and a man is killed, a fast pace is picked up and maintained.  However, the true exaltation felt is not in watching a scene unfold, but rather in discovering why the scene unfolded.  Critics rave over the astuteness demonstrated by this film as complex characters reveal new sides of their personality throughout the film.  <br />The revelations shown in the final seconds weave the finale to the fascinating storyline that will inevitably catapult a chain of similar films to follow.  In retrospect, the audience can only follow so far as Leonard Shelby can and that's enough to keep you mesmerized in this film for a while to come.
0767805712|5.0|This is sci-fi, but it's sci-fi qua sci-fi European style, with a focus on aesthetics and a sparseness of dialogue--certainly not a &quot;messy American sci-fi action movie.&quot;  This enables the viewer to picture and concentrate on the fascinating premise, which is that of a society in the not-so-distant future where your station in life is institutionally determined (and limited by) your genetic code.  Ethan Hawke works hard to defy genetic limitations and societal expectations and to impress Uma Thurman, who in turn doesn't say much but looks very smart and very pretty.  Are you interested in this movie?
B00005QK3B|5.0|This is the first Marillion album Ive bought with Fish as the front man. Im kinda going backwards obviously. When I first heard H I was blown away and picked up every Marillion album he was on. When I heard this album I got the same feeling. It is not fair to compare these two singers but both are capture many emotions in there vocals and lyrics. This album is right up there with my favorites and I will continue to travel backwards down the history of Marillion. So should everyone else.
B000002KHB|4.0|This is a good place to start if you've never heard any Deep Purple.  Machine Head has a 70's sound, but that's good.  It's a 70's sound that still sounds good now.  I don't rate this a 5 like the others but it is still worth getting and some of the songs really get down.  I think &quot;Space Truckin'&quot; has aged the best.  &quot;Lazy&quot; always sounded good, and then there's &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; which I think got overplayed.  This isn't real intricate, complicated stuff but doesn't need to be.  It plays well loud and sounds like Deep Purple should. It's definitely not as &quot;heavy&quot; as Deep Purple in Rock but it's still one of their best albums.
6305499365|5.0|Office space is the funniest movie i have ever watched.  I am a teenager and comedys are an important movie topic in our lives. Our lives revovle around movies and T.V. Office Space was introduced to me through my brother. He told me I had to see it. I watched the movie with a few of my friends, and i almost had a heart attack, i was laughing so much.  Very memorable scenes in the movie.  &quot;Thats my stapler&quot; Funniest movie ever.  I recomened this movie to anybody that doesnt have any heart conditions or is pregnant. (just to be safe)  I dont know why this movie was not really popular.  But thanx to me I spread the word of this movie to every single on of my friends and i let them borrow my video of office space, and they told everybody, after a week, everybody in my high school was talking about it.
B0000033P2|5.0|This is rock well done.  I always thought this album went well with the two Yes albums, &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, but it definitely is an original work.  &quot;From the Beginning&quot; is one of the best songs they ever did and each song at the beginning of each side (if you're familiar with the record album) are exceptional.  Keith Emerson doesn't get too carried away with his keyboard proficiency here and the sound is excellent.  If you like ELP you should definitely have this.
B000069HKH|5.0|An impressive statement by an artist who seemed to have his best behind him. This album is one of his top 3 with Born to Run and The River. Its versatility keeps you wanting to play it over and over again. It appeals to many emotions from sheer joy to outright sadness. May very well be my favorite record of 2002. Impressive, very impressive. Thanks, Bruce!
B000008H1W|5.0|This album is a &quot;5&quot;, I don't even have to think about it.  I agree with another review, that at first this sounded like something that didn't make much sense.  But this is one of those albums that doesn't necessarily sound great right from the start.  You have to give it time to &quot;all come together&quot;, and when it does (on about my 5th listen) you know you are hearing something spectacular.  After the medieval beginning to the song &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; comes drum rhythms and guitar stuff that is incredible.  There are unique rhythms in portions of some of these songs that can take some time to get the hang of.  After it all sinks in the whole thing comes together.  &quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla&quot; is easy to follow right from the start and some of the others.  &quot;Black Satin Dancer&quot; has a different sound that takes some getting used to but to sum it all up;  This is Jethro Tull's best album.  That's my opinion, but I have heard nearly all the others and as good as they are, nothing compares to this one.
B00005214X|5.0|George surprised the world with this record right after the Beatles split up. It is still one of the best post-Beatles albums with Lennon's Plastic Ono Band and Macca's Band on the Run. The outdated production sounds authentic now. George showed for the first time that he could come up with (more than) an album of great self-penned songwriting. Bless you, George!
B000067CPX|4.0|If you were never a fan of the Chili Peppers' funk/rock/punk/rap hybrid, you will most likely love this album as much as I do. It is a stunning departure for (and evolution of) a band that clearly loves music and the healing power inherent therein. This record will soothe, entertain, inspire, and gratify. Everything about the album seems an attempt for musical transcendance, an attempt to open and broaden the scope of the mind through the power of music and poetry. <br />The very intention behind the album, its lyrics, harmonies, musicianship, and the songs' meandering and gently unfolding structure, all harken back to the 1960's vibe of peace, love, and enlightenment. Melody and harmony allow Anthony Kiedis' voice to soar as John Frusciante's backup vocals intensify each song's mood and emotion. <br />Reminiscent of the Beach Boys and other '60's sounds, &quot;By the Way&quot; celebrates a renaissance of all that was good in the music of the 1960's by augmenting those sounds with 21st century writing and production. &quot;By the Way&quot; addresses timeless values and universal human experiences through compelling, often beautiful songs.<br />I think only a longtime, tight, and accomplished band could create something like &quot;By the Way,&quot; a musical journey into the human heart and emotions. Kudos to the band for embracing evolution, and growth, and change. I didn't have much to say about their older work, but I'm planning to hold on to &quot;By the Way&quot; for a long time to come.
B00000JYGX|5.0|I first came upon this recording when I lent my friend my Aida CD and she lent me some other CDs in return, saying that Notre Dame de Paris was, \\"pretty good.\\" So I took it home and listened to it at one o'clock in the morning in my Discman, sleepy and not knowing what to expect. Boy, was my friend wrong! This CD isn't just \\"good\\", it's SPECTACULAR!!<br />By the way, I am reviewing for the 2 CD live version of the musical. (Amazon sometimes puts reviews for different versions on one page.) I still can't believe people can sing so well live. The whole cast sounds so into it, and the music just flows on and on without any mistakes or hitches and it totally draws you in. <br />Okay, I have no more words to describe the music except this: if you are doubting whether to buy this CD or not, BUY IT. It is a beautiful combination of orchestral strings, guitars, and pop sounds. The guitars are lovely in the slow songs and the deep drums are overpowering in the fast songs. You WILL NOT be dissapointed. <br />As for the singers... I personally like Bruno Pelletier's Gringoire and Daniel Lavoie's Frollo the most. Here's what I think of all the singers...<br />Pelletier (Gringoire)... His rich, tenor voice is so clear yet silky, effortless and emotional! I love it to bits.<br />Lavoie (Frollo)... Hmm, I haven't seen many people talk about him, but he stood out very much for me. His voice is VERY powerful and fluctuates between smooth and downright raw. The songs between him and Esmeralda always send chills into me. <br />Helene Segara (Esmeralda)... I have mixed feelings about her voice. On one hand, her sultry and soft voice goes very well with her character of a gypsy, but on the other hand it sometimes sounds too weak. I understand that a gypsy shouldn't sound like an opera sopranist, but in my opinion Esmeralda could have sounded better if a singer with a more powerful voice took her place. Don't get me wrong, Helene does a MARVELOUS job as Esmeralda.<br />Patrick Fiori (Phoebus)... This guy's voice is youthful and clear. The innocent voice is perfect for \\"the sun god\\" Phoebus.<br />Luck Mervil (Clopin)... Umm, I don't really have an impression of Clopin, mainly because he sings with his groupies most of the time. His voice is raspy, emotional, and convey's Clopin's character well.<br />Julie Zenatti (Fleur-de-lys)... I like her voice a lot! She was only eighteen or something when she did this musical! She sounds as clear as a bell and very sweet.<br />Garou (Quasimodo)... In my opinion, Garou's super-raspy voice is PERFECT for Quasimodo. His songs are all steeped in angst/passion/love/grief. He sings amazingly well, the raspiness complementing his voice a great deal.   <br />I hope I didn't forget anyone in this rather long winded review. If you are still reading this, stop now and buy NOTRE DAME DE PARIS!!
B000069HKH|5.0|This is truly an exceptional album.  What other artist of our timee could address Sept. 11th the  way that he has?  Just listen to &quot;You're Missing.&quot;  That pretty much sums it up for me.
B00001PE4D|3.0|Warning, this isn't going to be the resoundingly favorable review that a lot of the posters have given.  Its also not going to be a really horrible review.  I've seen this movie a few times, out of curiousity because a lot of my friends enjoyed it. I consider Milos Forman's adaptation of Dangerous Liasons to be the best one.<BR>This is a fair movie.  Your life isn't going to change from watching it, but it will not be two hours wasted.  It was interesting to see how the director handled the Dangerous Liasons story elements.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays the sort of person everyone loves to hate.  Reese Witherspoon plays a sympathetic sort of character, who you end up cheering for.  Ryan Phillipe is nice to look at and does an ok job of playing the casanova.  <BR>My favorite parts of the movie are when Ryan and Reece are in the car and Reece starts making faces at him.  She tells him he takes himself too seriously and she is exactly right.  My other favorite is when Reece finally gives in to Ryan and they fall in love.  Ryan's character stops being a caricature and starts being a real person.<BR>Rent or buy this film if you want a nice two hours spent in a world only Hollywood could invent and don't want anything too serious.
B000069CWE|5.0|Wow! This CD is great! I had great expectations for Linkin Park's new CD. I waited so long. Well, they sure met them my standards. A very nice follow-up remix CD of their other cool Hybrid Theory album. Reanimation was tranformed into a rock-rap mix, with electronic sounds and voices. Just like Hybrid Theory, every song was outstanding. To tell you the truth, I didn't want to buy this CD at first. I thought ithe songs would just be a repeat. But the \\"reanimations\\" were extraordinary. No need to worry about profanity, if you do. They don't use any. Reanimation is just as good as Hybrid Theory. Here's an overview of the songs.<BR>1-Opening-A nice calm instrumental tune. <BR>2-Pts. of Ahtrty-great song, great video (comes in CD)<BR>3-Ent hE Nd- a cool rap remix of the the original single<BR>4-Chali-a message on a phone<BR>5-Frgt/10-takes you to another world of occasional electronic sounds<BR>6-P5hng Me A*wy-Cool rock remix<BR>7-Plc. 4 mie head- nice mix of the original<BR>8-X-ecutioner style- a mix of all songs, with DJ work and rap.<BR>9-H!

B000066NW0|4.0|What really makes this album extra-ordinary from all the other Pop-Rock albums I've listened to is the first track. I've had this theory that the first track of an album tells the listener whether they'll like the rest of it or not. It mostly is a melodic up-tempo song with a catchy chorus and a beat that makes you want to dance. But this time it's different. &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, the first track, is a rather depressive song, yet powerful. As for the whole album, it's really sometimes Pop and sometimes Rock, but it's definitely not Punk. You could call &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; Pop-Punk, but that's all. The good thing is that all of the songs seem to tell a different story and that shows Avril's talent as a song-writer. I like each song off the album, but my favorite song is &quot;I'm With You&quot; which reveals Avril's great voice. I wouldn't compare her to any artist, she's just Avril Lavigne, that's never been there before. It's the best album I've heard for months.
078401213X|1.0|I had heard a lot of really good things about this movie. Several different people all recommended it to me: &quot;It involves math and science fiction; you'll like it.&quot;, &quot;It's off-beat and weird; you'll like it.&quot;, and &quot;It's unique and makes you think; you'll enjoy it.&quot;<br />Nope, can't say that I did. It dragged in the story. It didn't make much sense at any point. I barely found the characters interesting. And the ending was a relief that I no longer had to watch the drudgery of a film rather than the satisfaction of an entertaining movie.<br />Maybe I just missed the point of the film. Maybe it really was entertaining. But I would rather slide down a razor blade into a pool of iodine than watch this a second time.

B00005221L|5.0|Predator is my favorite Schwarzenegger flick, closely followed by Commando. It has the usual stuff I like in an action film - muscles, big weapons, bad dialogue, and it has Arnold, which raises it above the level of other action films.<br />I won't waste anyone's time by describing the plot of this film (I'm wagering $5 that you know it already), but I would just like to remind you that if you haven't seen this film recently, it's about that time to \\"stick around,\\" stop being such a \\"pencil-pusher\\" and watch the film again.<br />Excellent film, always fun to watch
B00000I2MQ|5.0|I bought the 2CD version of this collection for much less here in Amazon,  WITH the B-Sides, don't get fooled this is not the 2CD collection it is only the original (just imported). It may be imported but not worth all that much more!<br /><br />However the \\"limited\\" version 2CD (which I posted a review to it) it's really worth every penny and it's beautiful.  Shouldn't be left out of any U2 collection.  The B-Sides itself is priceless.
6305165912|5.0|TBL can only be described as a cult classic. It is probably the most re-watchable film you'll ever see, and one that you will probably quote until you're dead in the ground.<br />For a film about nothing, Lebowski has everything. Acting is superior - Turturro is his usual versatile self, as are Goodman and Buscemi, and I don't think I'd be wrong if I said that no one could probably portray the Dude as well as Bridges did. The film has one-liners like there's no tomorrow - almost every line from the film can be used in some hilarious context in real life. And finally, it only gets better with repeated viewing. I don't think there's ever been a time that I've seen this film and have not learned something new - and I don't think I'd be lying if I said that I've seen it 20 times, at least.<br />It was this film that introduced me to the Coen brothers, and it was because of this film that I decided to watch O Brother, Where Art Thou (another classic). If you've never seen a Coen Brothers film, this is probably your best opportunity.
0609610570|4.0|I thought this was a very well written book.  While most of the book is common sense, I am always amazed at how often CEO's of large organizations miss these key elements.<br />I would recommend this to anyone climbing the ladder.  Employ this common sense and your career will go far.  It is common to get caught up in the strategy and miss the boat on implementation!  <br />I would also recommend this to any CEO that sits in their office with the door closed.  This book is a great reminder to get out there and implement the strategy you envisioned!
B000069HKH|5.0|After 18 years, it is great to see the entire E-Street band back and in fine form.  The album while very good, does have some mixing issues, and it is muddied by it's production.  However, aside from that, this is a great album, and shows that rock is far from dead in the year 2002.
0425170349|3.0|My first book from Clancy.  Decent plot, great ending, but took too long to get to it.  I would try another of his books.
B000068TPN|4.0|I believe that this is one of the all-time best movies about the Vietnam War.  I read the book after I saw the movie and the movie did a pretty good job of following the book (although the movie did add in more of the story about the families).  The only thing that bothered me about this movie was the ending.  I think that there should have been either a commentary or a little paragraph at the end explaining that after LZ X-Ray there was trouble at LZ Albany and maybe even a list of those that died in that Ia Drang battle.  But otherwise a truly touching story on the Vietnam War.
0812513495|5.0|I'm not a regular science fiction reader but had heard so many positive, glowing reports about ENDER'S GAME, that I decided to read it. I usually judge a book by the impact and effect it has on me; and if I can remember the story for a length of time after I've read it, I determine it is a good book. Well, I read ENDER'S GAME three weeks ago and I still think of children and war. ENDER'S GAME was a creative, excellent way to tell us what most should know- in children lie our hope and future; the values, attitudes and beliefs they learn and live by will determine the world they live in. ENDER'S GAME can challenge our own assumptions and beliefs. It is definitely worth reading.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I was hesitant at first to buy this album, as it was very experimental. But being a Radiohead fan, I decided to anyway. Despite my reservations from listening to clips..., I have thoroughly enjoyed this album. The 30 second clips don't do it justice, as Yorke agrees there is no \\"here comes the chorus\\" parts in this entire album.<br />Thom describes the songs as little fragments of people's lives...not the full thing. Like Kid A, the album doesn't go in a particular direction. The songs are different from each other in many respects.<br />I enjoyed this more than Kid A for one reason...less manufactured music. More real instruments were used to create a more realistic state of drowsy, sleepy sounds. The songs combine perfectly, all up to the last song, \\"Life in a Glass House.\\" This song features jazz instruments and gives off an air of New Orleans drunk...or high. Anyway, it is the perfect way to end an album, as was \\"The Tourist,\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack.\\" I highly recommend this album to any open-minded Radiohead fans...particularly those who enjoyed the previous two albums.
B00005QG9J|2.0|Oh dear, once again instead of maturing the band have simply lost their edge and degenerated into a lame attempt at something new. This is no where near as refreshing as SCIENCE was and manages to land them perfectly on planet medocre. Poo.
B00005ASHM|5.0|There was a period of time in the very late 60s and well into the 70s that everyone was doing concept albums.  At one point it seemed that there were more concept albums than non-concept albums.  Pick an artist, it's a near certainty they did a concept album.<br />One proviso:  I am going to discuss concept album as it relates to rock music only.  There are numerous other works of music that could potentially fit the definition of a concept album, and that will distract from this dicussion.<br />Concept albums in rock music didn't just pop into existence.  Many people point to &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; as being the first &quot;true&quot; rock concept album.  Assuming that &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was in fact the first rock concept album, where did IT come from?  Well, the lads point to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as being the inspiration for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;.<br />&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is one of those albums that occasionally is released that has a Jekyll/Hyde existence.  Many people either hated it or didn't understand it, while those who saw the evolution of rock into art realized that this album was helping direct that evolution.  As always in everything from movies to books, the difference between art and entertainment became a huge factor in the album's initial commercial lack of success.<br />There was nothing like &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; when it came out.  Furthermore, the music was very different from what The Beach Boys had done previously.  A recipe for commercial disaster.  Long time fans of &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; and &quot;Surfing U.S.A.&quot; wondered what these songs were all about.  This stuff just wasn't The Beach Boys they knew.  Little did most fans know that The Beach Boys they knew never were The Beach Boys they thought they knew.<br />It wasn't until many years later that the complex relationships and creative conflicts between the members of the group were brought to light, and the discovery that Brian Wilson in particular wanted the group to grow in a more mature direction.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was a very long step in that direction.<br />We look back on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; from our next millenium perspective and want to say, &quot;What's the big deal?&quot;  It was a very big deal in 1966.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; sparked a whole new revolution in rock music the effect of which can never be fully understood or estimated.  These albums were the sound of rock music growing up.  However, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was too alien for the typical public taste at the time, and it flopped.<br />But...other musicians loved it.  Particularly The Beatles.  John and Paul particularly recognized the roots of something great, and were strongly influenced by it.  Many other rock and pop musicians have pointed to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; as being a big influence on their music.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was music as art.  &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, while also striving for art, also managed to be commercially successful.  However, there are songs from &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; which followed well the artistic path of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; that had their own detractors.  Unfortunately not everyone understands art.<br />Listening today, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is somewhat dated.  However, listen to it over and over, and you realize that the music is well done.  From our perspective we can look back over 25+ years of rock music and realize that &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; was ahead of its time.  In all the hysteria of The Beatles, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; got lost.<br />&quot;Pet Sounds&quot; is great rock because of what it was when it was released, and who it influenced.<br />Beyond the influence, there are some really great songs on this CD.  &quot;Sloop John B.&quot; is one of my favorite Beach Boys songs.  &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice&quot;, &quot;That's Not Me&quot;, &quot;I Know There's an Answer&quot;, &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, &quot;Caroline No&quot;...all very good to greatsongs.  Admittedly somewhat mellow, but beautiful.<br />Should you buy this album?  Well, depends on what you like.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; refuses to fit into a nice niche.  It's not like what The Beach Boys did before it.  It is mellow, but it's not a perfect fit into pop music.  If you've heard at least 3 or 4 of the songs above, and like them, then you'll like the rest of the CD.  If you haven't heard very much of the CD, then either download samples or borrow a copy.  I, on the other hand, may need to purchase another copy, because I think the laser diode is knocking too many molecules off my copy, I play it so much.songs.

B00003CXCW|5.0|I have seen this film 20 times, both in the Movie Theater and on VHS, and loved it every minute of it.  I also seen the Broadway production of which Glenn Close was the leading actress. Combining these two, the film and the musical is a dream come true. Superv and phenomenal quality. Gloria Swanson as her predecessor is wonderful in this film.  I loved her. The drama of a bygone hollywood actress is the ultimate.  It is highly recommended to have this film as a collection.  I have waited for so long to come to DVD. <br />\\"And now, Mr. De Mille, I am ready for my close up!\\"

Buy it. you won't regret. Every chapter is more interesting that the other.
B00005YW4H|5.0|When I first heard Norah Jones I was intrigued.  Her voice was unlike something I'd heard before.  The second time that I encountered her unique sound was at the USA/International Ballet Competition, where from then on I have adored her.  Hearing Norah's voice gave me chills by her song \\"Don't know Why\\".  Although many seem to critize her for not being \\"jazzy\\" enough, but that's just part of her appeal, she's her own sound, her own genre.  A genre that is just \\"Norah Jones\\", which is fabulous, because no one can steal something like that.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|If you have listened to Enrique's music from the past, this album is definitely one of kind from all the others he has worked on.  The music is more pop, and the lyrics are a little more edgy.  Overall, the album has some great dance music, smooth and romantic lyrics, and a beautiful voice to go along with it.  The only thing I would change is that there is too much of a computer synthesized sound in some of the songs.
B000066JES|4.0|Let's get one thing straight right off the bat- I'm a huge Manowarrior. I own every album, have seen them 3 times in concert and met them twice. I waited impatiently for what seemed like an eternity for the new CD from the Metal Kings. And finally they gave it to us- \\"Warriors Of The World\\". The first track, \\"Call To Arms\\", is a true Manowar number- powerful riffing, lethal vocals and a sound capable of blowing even the most hardened of eardrums. It's sad that after that, it slips somewhat. \\"Fight For Freedom\\" isn't too bad, but it's no \\"Blow Your Speakers\\" or \\"Hail And Kill\\"...., the middle part of the CD is hardly worth mentioning...sorry, but for me, opera and Elvis do NOT belong on a Manowar CD. PERIOD. Fortunately, the CD is saved by the last four songs on the disc- the landmark \\"Warriors Of The World United\\", \\"Hand Of Doom\\", \\"House Of Death\\" and \\"Fight Until We Die\\". If you could take the first song and the last four and put them together, you'd have a real Manowar CD that would have been worth the long wait that we had to endure. As it is, it's not really a bad CD- I'd still recommend buying it before touching any of that \\"nu-metal\\" [stuff]- but for someone who is discovering Manowar for the first time, I'd recommend Fighting The World or Louder Than Hell for your first experience.
B00005JKL8|2.0|The trick with this movie is simple, just follow these easy steps to really enjoy it.<br />1. Watch the first third of it because it's amazing air combat scenes, the movie is very, very promising, perhaps the only objectionable thing is the use of a 2 seater F-18 (not technically accurate), but is a valid dramatic license in order to have the history develop down the road.<br />2. Once the first third is done, step up to your DVD player, press the eject button, grab the disc and store it away never to be used again. From the point when the grounded pilot starts being chased by the &quot;bad guys&quot; the movie goes down faster than a pilotless F-18. As a sample, at one point or &quot;heroe&quot; gets rescued by a Coke drinking, rap fan, resistance fighter... Coke in a war zone ?!? Ice-T (or was it Ice Cube) t-shirts available in a war zone ?!? Clearly the producers have never bothered to research the real misery that takes place in a real war zone and is almost disrespectful !<br />To add insult to injury, no other than the USS Carl Vinson commanding officer himself goes to retrieve a downed pilot... anybody sees the error on this ?!?<br />Terrible movie, I was invited to the movie theater to watch it and still want my money back !
B00005YW4H|4.0|When a non-mainstream artist makes some kind of impact on the charts, he or she becomes some kind of a focal point. At the age of 22, Norah Jones has exceeded many xpectations of her.<br /><br />Come Away With Me serves best at introducing the masses to jazz music. While not overly jazzy to alienate mainstream listeners, the singer infuses some form of modernity to the songs and past masterpieces to bring jazz music to a whole new level through her interpretation. Jones may not hide her inexperience, her efforts are by no means inadequate.<br /><br />Though still far from the likeness of Grammy winner Diana Krall, both Krall and Jones seek to bring the genre into the limelight and gladly, more people can discover the wonders of jazz music.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I personally love this album! It contains poppy songs, blues and ballads and some traditionals. People who complain about this album must have expected this to be more religious. This may not be an album when you listen during your family-get-together, but it is very good for those who enjoys urban christmas holiday. My favorite is &quot;Have yourself a merry little christmas&quot; (great jazzy mix!) and &quot;This Christmas&quot;(I always thought this song was better without vocal, but christina changed my mind!!)<br />I especially recommend this album for those who will have somewhat lonely christmas: THIS WILL BRIGHTEN UP YOUR CHRISTMAS DAY LIKE NO OTHER ALBUMS WOULD DO!!

B0000640VO|5.0|This is a wonderful film. Though this film has many special effects and an interesting directing style, it is the acting, the writing, and the solid direction that make it a classic. I especially enjoyed the character writing for the characters at the cafe where Amelie works! The techniques and especially the unconventional special effects that the director use may remind you of &quot;Moulin Rounge&quot;. Not only do we see Amelie and her life, we see her mind too thru floating images of Amelie's thoughts that hover on the side of the screen. At first, I was afraid the director would overuse these techniques. Hapily, these images always had purpose in showing the impish nature of Amelie, and always made me laugh!<BR>This movie was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone. As for adult content, yes it has it, but nothing that an adult should be offended by... What more is there to say?

6305736650|5.0|This is probably the best pure Hollywood film ever, yeah, but here's what I appreciate about it: Nazis.<BR>This is one of the few films I have seen in which the German soldiers of WWII are not portrayed as either one-hundred percent cold, evil, faceless monsters (the prevailing outlook of most war films and, of course, all Holocaust films) or fat, childlike ninnies (the \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" view). They are portrayed as human beings. And this was made during the war!<BR>Not that I support Nazism, but I hate it when movies and books reduce anyone to stereotypes.
0694003611|5.0|When I first read this, I was a little confused, but then I realized that the BUNNY is going to sleep, not the moon. That changed things to the point where I would definitely consider this among my Top 16 favorite books of all-time. I would recommend the pop-up version, though. The mechanics of the red balloon garner sheer delight! So all in all, I think children will get a big kick out the rhyming (perfect meter, and effective use of repitition), and that the concepts of sleep and primary colors will grow on them more and more with each read. As long as he or she goes into the book knowing that moons don't sleep, I think this is an educational tool alerting children to the benefits of sleep indulgence.
B000002G7E|5.0|This album just gets better and better every time I listen to it. It's amazing how all this noise and droning and evil-minded lyricism can combine into such a product of pure beauty. I take issue with those who give this five-star reviews but still don't believe that \\"Here She Comes Now\\" is a pretty song or that \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" could be mistaken for an indie pop song, at least before it becomes a wonderful piece of cruelty. I didn't like \\"Sister Ray\\" the first time either, but now it seems SO rock and roll. And I can't believe that anyone has actually listened to the hilarious \\"The Gift\\" and still given this a bum review. \\"Nico,\\" however, is better, if simply for the presence of the woman herself and the arrangements being more apparent. And the cover beats this one hands down.
0385720920|4.0|I have been reading many reviews for this book and I find a common thread in most of the dissatisfied readers: they need a book to seem intellectual and smart for them to read it. Many people are complaining about the writing style being similar to that of a 15 year old. Even if this is true, does it have to distract your attention from the book? I'll admit, this book has questionable narrative, but I still enjoyed it. I don't need to tell my friends I read some over-the-top literary work to be seen as a smart person. I can enjoy any book that has a well thought out plot structure, interesting characters, and a creative writing style. 4 stars.
B000002UAO|5.0|My favorite Beatles album is perhaps the best rock album in history, because it marks the last moment the Beatles embraced pure rock and roll as opposed to the orchestral nature (and occasional overreach) of the later items. A wonderful album for all moods and all moments. A must have.
0380977788|5.0|This book is an awesome addition to the collection of any Neil Gaiman fan. Told in the classic English fairy tale voice, he crafts a young adult novel that is original, creepy, and fantastic.  I think adults might get a bigger chill from it than children...all the more reason to love it.
0684833395|5.0|Absolute, unadulterated genius. The funniest book I've ever read, but also the darkest, the most horrifying, and the most enchanting. <BR>Nothing else to say, really, but after a couple of reads it becomes remarkably easy to follow, the jokes still work, your perception of certain characters changes, and it becomes BETTER.<BR>A cornerstone of my life. <BR>And Heller was actually IN World AWar II. He knows what he's talking about.<BR>(The chapter &quot;Snowden&quot; never ceases to give me chills. I gave this to a friend of mine who was way inot joining the Marines. Now it's his favorite, too, and he's not so sure. So the message works.)
B000007O9L|4.0|One of the first stones Tapes I  bought with the belief that &quot;every car should have a rolling stones tape in it&quot; the songs are mostly all excellent, not all of them are well known, but it was a constant in my tape deck and I could listen to it over and over and not worry much about traffic, sadly my tape broke a month or so ago, but this is definitely a great album by a great band
B000003TAW|5.0|I always read the bad reviews first, but I can't fathom how it is that even the most jaded and/or tone deaf person can give this perfect pop collection less than a three-star rating.<BR>This is about as perfect as a pop-rock record can get. Each song is shiny and bright aand catchy as hell. The utter simplicity of the songwriting adds to the wonderful vibes of it all, like this was a Buzzcocks album or something. The lyrics are all cute and clever and very, very good, with passable singing and gorgeous production. The songs work on many levels, all sound happy and sad at the same time, but almost every lyric has a joke to it that makes it pass both ways, paying due to the duality of all emotions. And the band is nerdy as hell, which is good because we know that in the end only the nerds of the world are really going to matter.<BR>One of the few discs I own I can listen to many times in a row.
B000067CPX|4.0|The new look for the Red Hot Chili Peppers kicks! With the whole new sound and songs, including the first single, \\"By The Way\\", the CD brings a newer look to what people have seen of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Songs like \\"By the Way\\", are much different from older songs like \\"Give it Away\\" (Blood Sugar Sex Magik). A little bit softer then usual Chili Peppers music. Most of the funk is gone but more of the softer rock is here. I rate By the Way 4 stars for its new look for the band and softer then funkier.
B0000024SI|5.0|Dylan's most rocking album, far ahead of \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" and even \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" is still my favorite. I don't pretend to understand every single lyric, but I always have an impression, and that's more than most writers can muster. <BR>Contrary to popular belief, Dylan has the best singing voice in rock. If it weren't for him, how could anyone playing on the radio today ever make it big? Character and emotion can be expressed through a bad voice just as easily or even more easily than through a powerful one. Unless you're an opera star or Paul McCartney or something, even real singers can't seem anything but hollow. And most blues singers are just screamers ...
B00005Q4CS|5.0|It's often said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. In the case of this film, \\"good intentions\\" is analogous with \\"undying dreams.\\" I remember seeing this film in the theater and being emotionally battered and bruised for the following two days. \\"Over a drug film?\\" I thought? I examined it and myself further and found it not to be a film about drugs, but about simple addictions and the horror of seeing a dream come close to realization and start to fall apart.<br />The story of junkies and dreamers who refuse to let go of either intoxicating aspect of their character is dangerously effective. Despite having vastly different lifestyles than most of the populace, Aronofsky deftly makes each character idetifyable: Mother, sister, brother, friend, self... The story then leads the characters through their dreams and their addictions (sometimes being the same thing) an leads them unflinchingly to their conclusions.<br />Thankfully, the DVD is ripe with all sorts of delicious extras. Commentaries, behind the scenes, outtakes: it's all in there. And it's all informative and genuine, making it evident that this film was definitely a labor of love. Too bad it was so horribly robbed of award show attention.<br />The effect is that \\"Requiem\\" is a powerful uppercut of a film that requires the viewer to have a sense of humanity to take something away from it.
B000002KET|5.0|What makes this album so amazing for me is not just that Sabbath take some serious risks here, experimenting heavily with their trademark scud-dropping riffs and dark, menacing atmosphere, but that it actually *works* to harrowing effect. Countless metal bands have approached that point in their careers where it would seem redundant to churn out yet another album chock full of heaviness. Many have gone the dreaded commercial power-ballad route, while others toyed with different sounds, like synths, in search of something different to break them out of the heavy metal cul-de-sac. But back in the mid-70s, when Metal bands were still writing the rules for the genre, it may have seemed as if there were more possibilities to try out; more ways to experiment without feeling hampered by the conventions of the genre.     This is my favorite Sabbath album, and here's why:     Right off the bat, the opening title track starts off with one of most brilliant, hard-hitting riffs of Tony Iommi's career. The rhythm section slams relentlessly along, while Ozzy delivers his lines with a commanding wail, but then wait a minute... the song abruptly glides into this beautiful, weak in the knees, lushly melodic chorus, one of the most beautiful things *anyone* has ever written. And it totally works. That they had the guts to juxtapose their heaviest, darkest riffs with lighter than air, lounge-inflected melodies (that if anything foreshadows 80s guitar-pop like Aztec Camera & the Smiths) is indicative of an incredibly resourceful band in peak form. They knew they could pull it off without alienating their fans or detracting from their heaviness one iota. If anything, the juxtaposition makes the heavy parts seem heavier, and the light parts seem even prettier. This an amazingly sophisticated song, yet it's still classic metal. I can't emphasize enough what a mind-blowing song this is.      The second song, the moody, foreboding \\"National Acrobat,\\" offers yet another seminal lesson in Metal, of which countless NWOBHM bands obviously took note. With its haunting, melancholy two-guitar harmonies, countered by thick, sludgy riffs, the song exudes a unique fragility while still being heavy as hell. The band hits hard here, and some of the riffs toward the second half have been ripped off by too many bands to count.     After that one-two punch, \\"Fluff\\" is a gentle, mellifluous instrumental with acoustic guitar and piano that would've fit in just fine on Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" or any of Felt's Creation-era records. And yet Sabbath pulls it off like they've been writing stuff like this the whole time. This is not filler - clearly a lot of thought went into this song's composition. Amazing.     Other songs worth mentioning, like the sinister, dark, hard-hitting \\"Killing Yourself to Live,\\" and the haunting, yet strangely poppy \\"Looking for Today,\\" further display Sabbath's knack for incorporating non-metal sounds into songs that still manage to be more metal than just about anything else. While \\"Killing Yourself to Live\\" filters Iommi's spot-on riffs through a bizarre chorus effect during the verses, the chorus of \\"Looking for Today\\" is marked by warm acoustic guitar and subtle, haunting flute (!) melodies. And then there's the gothic/sci-fi atmosphere of \\"Who Are You?\\" driven by an eerie riff played on an analog synth. All three songs, as a result, benefit from this unique textural variation, which adds depth and keeps the listener on his toes. And as I keep saying, that these songs *still* manage to be as heavy as a bulldozer is a testament to the brilliance and vision of the group.        \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" may be grower for some. The first two songs hook you right away, but the rest of it may require a few listens before it really sinks in. But once it does, it reveals itself as one of the most fascinating, innovative, and darkest albums of the genre. The band went out on a limb with some of the sounds here, and they pull it off brilliantly.
0452281881|5.0|Not fair!  I started reading this book when I was tired.  Big mistake.  I found myself unable to put it down.  Late into the night I'm still reading...and laughing.  <br />I had the distinct impression that Beaumont had worked side by side with me, and had read some of the same emails I used to get. I swear I know Carla, Zoe, and Crutton personally.  <br />What truly surprised me was how easy it was to separate all the characters.  At first, I admit I was lost, but then I started to sort them out - enough that I went back and re-read the first part of the book.  <br />Bottom line - great book, wonderful read.
0345440900|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book after my baby was born and figuring out what he was trying to tell me.  I heard good things about it from reviews and friends. I imagined tuning into his secret language and helping him become a happy little baby b/c mommy knew what he needed.  While I did accomplish some of this--the pattern of E.A.S.Y. (eating, activity, sleeping) helped me understand SOMETIMES what might be wrong--I gave up trying to put him on a schedule like Hogg suggests.  I kept a journal, looked for his pattern, established rituals for bedtime, naptime, eating.  But in the end, I've given up because it stressed me to try to impose a schedule on him rather than cuddle him, fall asleep with him on my chest, give him a pacifier, or do whatever else seems right at the time.  So, take this book with a grain of salt--use what you can, don't use what doesn't work, and don't stress about it.
B0000683DH|5.0|The cognoscenti agree, this was the best Star Trek movie ever!  Only the truest fanatics (a small but vociferous group), were enthusiastic, after the somnambulistic  S.T.: The Motion Picture.  At the time, there had only been the series a tepid Saturday morning cartoon, and the even worse first movie.<br />But this film changed all that.  It was the follow up to a singularly popular episode from the television show, Space Seed, with Ricardo Montalban as the eugenics war creation Kahn Nonnien Singh.  Kirk , Spock. McCoy and the entire crew of the Enterprise stumble upon the man they had exiled more than a decade before and his small, aggressive crew.<br />Kirk vs. Kahn is the vehicle; revenge on Kahn's part is facilitated by the ability to take yet another ultimate weapon, called The Genesis device.  Genesis, as one would expect, can create life (so it seems) from inanimate matter, or, as Kahn seems intuitively to know, can replace (i.e. destroy)life where it may be found.   Coincidently, this project was created by genius Dr. Carol Marcus, who happens to be the mother of Kirk's now-adult and terribly embittered son. <br />Combat of course ensues (though not between the two primary antagonists).  They battle through space, and via starships chase one another through the galaxy in scenes reminiscent of classic World War Two submarine movies.  The climactic battle comes and then goes, with yet one more crisis supplanting the fight between these two.<br />As another said, this was the characterization for which true fanatics as well as casual fans were waiting.  A brilliantly written script indicates an incredible amount of work. The quotes transform the obsessed Kahn, turning him back several centuries into an fanatical  Captain Ahab, as he seeks to deliver the coup de grace to Kirk and his crew just as Ahab did the white whale.<br />The re-introduction of characters familiar and beloved for a series no one ever expected to be as enduring as it was.  Two hours of action.  Humor, suspense and amazing effects.  Tons of special features on the special  DVD edition.  Hard to beat this one!
B000069HJL|5.0|Ive had this concert on audio tape for over 15 years, and finally the tape just snapped!  Ive come here looking for the CD because this is to me just one of the most amazing, clearly recorded and executed concerts I have ever come across. To call it a classic would be putting it mildly. A must-have!
0790729393|5.0|I found this to be an incredibly compelling film, although it took a long time for me to get past the central brutality, and watch it a second and third time.  By then, I was hooked.<br />The underlying story is a troubling but familiar one, about young boys growing up in the Hell's Kitchen section of New York.  Their lives take them on a huge turn when heir \\"innocent\\" prank goes bad.  For their crime, they are sentenced to a year in a reform school for troubled boys, ostensibly to keep them from advancing into a life of crime. <br />Unfortunately, the institution is populated by not only brutally sadistic fellow inmates but also with guards who take the boys' remaining innocence and traumatize them.  The boys leave, but<BR>years later their paths bring them back across a terrible reminder of their past.  The remainder of the film is the turning of the law enforcement system, in which the system itself is shown for what it was, and the way it impacts these individuals.<br />One of the bit players, Frank Medrano as a neighborhood tough guy has the most timeless line of the film: \\"On the street, justice got no price. She's blind where the judge sits. But she ain't blind out here. Out here, the ... got eyes.\\"<br />Fabulous performances, even if they were critically not acclaimed.  Robert DiNero is terrific as a local priest who never gives up hope for \\"his boys\\", even to the point of ommitting perjury for them.  Kevin Bacon IS the sadistic guard, and there is real joy at seeing his comeuppance.  Brad Pitt and Dustin Hoffman appear as dueling lawyers in the courtroom scene, each giving marvelous and understated performances.  Ron Eldard steals his scenes as one of the abused boys, all grown up, who serendipitously discovering Bacon in a restaurant has the best line of the movie when Bacon asks him what he wants.  His retort, (which I will not quote, to avoid giving away the<BR>ending) delivered with deadly quiet, and is nothing short of chilling.<br />As another reviewer said, this film is stunning with its insight of boys' institution's and its horrors.  It makes one wonder if anyone can ever survive the institution which was supposed to be an alternative to jail for kids.  <br />Growing up in New York around the same time as the protagonists, and getting into just a tad of trouble myself, I kept thinking \\"There but for the Grace of God go I\\".  <br />That alone was enough to make me say \\"Damn!  What a movie\\"
B00006CXSS|5.0|\\"Band of Brothers\\" is without a doubt one of the greatest and most monumental mini-series ever to be shown on television.  When you see most war movies, you see a film about one battle, or one campaign, and its only two or three hours long.  With this mini-series format, you see around 12 hours of film that spans a couple of years of war.  Thus, you get a great deal more depth and detail than you do from a standard war movie.<br />The series is about one company of the 101rst Airborne Division during World War II, and follows that company of men from the time they are trained in the U.S., to their deployment to Britain, to the Normany Invasion, through the campaign to liberate France, during the Battle of the Bulge at Bastogne, and through the invasion of Germany to the end of the war.  Many of the episodes focus on one person of the unit as a sort of primary character, as he interacts with the others.  But through it all, the viewer gets an inside, no bull look at war at its worst, and the complex relationships that develop between men who face it together.<br />This mini-series was the brain child of Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, but is based on the book by the same title and subject by Stephen Ambrose, one of our most gifted World War II popular historians.  Ambrose is able to bring the story of World War II to life from the soldiers' point of view, in this book, and others such as \\"Citizen Soldiers\\", through his extensive interviews with veterans.<br />Hanks and Spielberg have faithfully taken that work, and they along with their cast and crew have produced a monument to the American soldier of World War II.  This mini-series is a must see for any history buff, historian, student, any American in general, and any human being interested in a moment in time when, as the tag line for the series says, \\"ordinary men were asked to do extraordinary things.\\"

6304263465|4.0|Scott Howard is going through some changes in life. Changes that will affect his standing in school, on the basketball court and in love. Scott has just found out he's a werewolf. As he is more popular and accepted as the wolf, its hard for Scott to give it up, there by pushing away his friends that he already has.<br />Released in the period when Michael J Fox was incredibly popular, with his Back To The Future releases, sees him in another hard to forget role of his career. As the story was made in the mid-80's, the storyline is quite simple and very cliché and probably wouldn't stand out as a good movie compared to releases of today. Although it is a fantastic movie based purely on nostalgic value and would be great for teens and adults alike who have yet to see it. Recommended viewing.
B00003CWTI|2.0|A unique film in one respect, i was told it was amazing and would blow me away by a couple of people. so, watched the first hour in complete bafflement and turned it off completely bored and disinterested, and would haqve left it there, but felt maybe it all came together in the last two hours, so watched from beginning again, i was right the first time.<br />The critics reviews leave you scrathing your head, as do the recomendations, it was incredibly depressing and pretty pointless, as too being about coincidence i found that whole concept so dumbed down, as to be painful.<br />The singalong is indeed a real turn off moment, and maybe this is a more real tom cruise but some of his monologues are just boring and you are itching too reach for the fast forward.<br />Julianne moore is almost unwatchable completely overacting and just awful.<br />The quiz kid story was the best and most original, and the cops story was initially good, but got lost badly in confused misdirection.<br />i think this is a film for those who want to be told they are watching something meaningful, and length = deep and meaningful.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This record just shot the group up to the next level.  The whole record rules, and I just can't seem to turn it off.  My friends are [not liking it] but at the same time I catch them humming the songs when they think I am not listening.  Fight Test , Do you realize, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt.1 and Pt. 2 are by far my favorites on the new record.  <br />I would be lying if I said I didn't miss the old rough and distorted Lips, but they have been reborn into something beautiful, that will not get old to anyone no matter what the age.  <br />Record reviewers can never say that a new Lips record is just the same old thing again.<br />Never.

6305531412|5.0|Disney's Who Framed Roger Rabbit was one of the largest acheivments of movie making history.  This movie's amazing special effects combining live action and animation put Mary Poppins' to shame.  This unique and captivating story is truley one of Disney's finest.  The mystery of \\"greed, sex, and murder\\" is made even more entertaing by combining Disney and Warner Bros. characters (such as Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Tweety Bird, andBetty Boop along with many other favorites make an appearence).  Don't miss this movie!
0375703861|4.0|I applaud Ms. Smith's debut. So many young women writers fall back on simplicity, cliche and stereotype in their novels, but Smith chose to tell a multi-generational, multi-ethnic, multi-layered story. With utter disregard to the oft-perpetuated \\"write only what you know\\" advice given to young writiers, Smith has crafted a complex, moving and zesty narrative which breathes life into mad families and dysfunctional individuals.
B000001DVD|5.0|High and Dry is the album to hear passionate, raw vocals from Joe Eliott and excellent guitar work form Steve Clark and Pete Willis. They seemed to have captured a mystique on this record that would culminate later in Pyromania. The first time I heard \\"Another Hit and Run\\" I was hooked.. There's a spontaneity felt here that is really genuine and sadly missed in there most recent few albums. Pyromania is a metal masterpiece yes, but High and Dry is where they truly took musical risks and put there guts on the line. \\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\" is just a classic ballad and by far there best...it's haunting yet very melodic and it's candidness is unmatched...even Joe's Sheffield accent when he sings, \\"Taking on the best of me\\"...his vocals never sounded so passionate! Another great thing is the pace of the record..the songs are in your face almost without a pause. Steve may not be in the Hall of Greats but his style of riffs and songwriting were unique..Pete Willis was great too..there styles meshed like no one else..High and Dry rocks hard and has pop harmonies which was unique considering how hard they rocked. That's what made them stand out as a band...how they cleverly mixed both of these qualities and pulled it off and still remaining heavy. I think Def Leppard knock Pete Willis too much..he was there for the writing of Pyromania too...Phil Collen replaced him and recorded a few solos but the songs were already there...<BR>High and Dry is a great album with only one track that is weak \\"(No, no, no)\\"...One song that to this day still gets me going is \\"Mirror, Mirror\\"...just a brilliant song..very moody and one of there most memorable and interesting riffs. There have been lots of comparisons to AC/DC but what separates High and Dry is the brilliant harmonies and the ricochet of 2 separate guitars weaving in and out of Joe's vocals.<BR>I highly recommend this cd...It's a must have in a quality hard rock collection. This will always be the album that Def Leppard truly rocked in a genuine way...no pretenses, no premeditations just honest Rock and Roll from 5 truly talented musicians... A very underated classic hard rock album. Who cares if the production paled next to Pyromania or Hysteria???...the songs are strong and the very rawness of the recording only adds to the greatness of it...
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'm an old guy, and have heard elements of John Mayer's sound before. But it's great to hear good guitar (fingerstyle, electric, rythm) on the radio again. His guitar reminds me of David Wilcox and maybe a little Bruce Cockburn (at least his more popular tunes). His voice sounds like a cross between Michael Franks and...as you've heard many times...Dave Matthews. In fact, the first few times I heard him, I assumed it was DM.<br />It's light stuff, but so be it. I long ago abandoned the idea of the perfect sound, and it's nice to hear light stuff from time to time. Balances out the White Stripes CD I bought at the same time (check that one out as well - beautifully raw and electric).
B00000JMP9|5.0|There is little I can add to the review by Noam Eitan regarding the artistic merits of this production.<br />I have been an unabashed fan of Petr Weigl ever since I obtained his productions of &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, &quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot; in VHS format (all, alas, delisted).<br />Cinematic interpretations of operas are, I believe, another artistic approach to these works. Even the live performance recordings come close to this freedom with elaborate sets and camera play. Admittedly Weigl tends to abridge and perhaps offends the purists, but he does end up with a very tight production. (After all, even in live productions, cuts are often made -- sometimes for no greater reason than to avoid paying overtime.)<br />Opera is theatre and Weigl brings it all to life. His actors all look the part, can really act, and do more than lip-synch -- they sing on the set, although their voices are not used. Most importantly, he has a great sense of setting, costumes, and camera angles.<br />However, in this production of Werther, he uses Dvorsky and Fassbaender visually as well as vocally, and very marvellous they both are.
B000002JKA|2.0|As a relative newcomer to D.T. (having only heard SFAM and IMAGES AND WORDS), my expectations were high prior to purchasing this one. I have to say what A DISAPPOINTMENT !!! Where are the catchy hooks and good songs that filled \\"Images\\" .It sounds like they were just putting this out to satisfy a contract. These guys are great musicians (especially Portnoy and Petrucci),but this disc lacks good songs and good production. It just sounds like a typical 90's band trying to be heavy, but with no substance.<br />In fact they never really got it back together until SFAM. Buy \\"Images\\" and \\"SFAM\\" , avoid everything else (except maybe \\"Six Degrees\\"). If you really want to hear these guys (most of them)play with substance and style get either of the \\"Liquid Tension Experiment\\" discs. Those are hands-down superior to this one.

B00002MZ12|5.0|This cd offers a diffirent version of alanis.  The live.  It take you on an intellectual journey and puts you face to face with issues that you can be personally or broadly connected too.  You also get to here her song uninvited which isn't featured on any alanis cd before this.  I strongly recomend everyone to buy this even the non alanis fans because with this you get a wide variety of her music.  A combination of her drastic anger in Jagged Little Pill and her enlightment in Supposed Former Infaution Junkie.
B00003CXZ4|1.0|This movie bites.  I don't usually write a review with such a base and overly simple description, but this one deserves it.  I found nothing what so ever in this movie to like.  Some people have hailed it as the intellect's movie.  That is why I originally wanted to see it.  But, an intellect's movie is good because the movie is intelligent, not because you have to be intelligent to understand the movie.<br />The precept of the movie, that a man with a memory disorder becomes a hired killer because he'll never feel guilty about what he can't remember, might have been interesting if it had been taken advantage of.  Unfortunately, I think the precept probably never actually made its way onto the screenwriter's desk.<br />The film makers wanted to do something different by starting at the end and moving the the beginning.  Well, I guess they did something that hadn't been done before.  Perhaps they should have thought a little about why it hadn't been done before.  The sum effect for me was simply irritating, as I was forced to watch the same footage over and over again, as it eventually lengthened to the beginning (which was actually at the end).  Did you get all that?<br />The acting was ok, but who cares in a movie so annoying and stupid.  Don't buy this movie, don't even bother to watch.  If my review still hasn't clarified the movie for you, just go to a thesaurus and look up all of the synonyms for pretentious and stupid.  Then you will know all about Momento.
B00005O5CM|3.0|I suspect one's gut reaction to \\"Legally Blonde\\" may hinge upon two things: fondness (or lack thereof) for Reese Witherspoon and her frothy LA sorority girl character, to whom this film entirely belongs; and  any personal experience with college and/or law school that allows the predictable script to seem funnier or more believeable than it is.<br /><br />The plot is a variation of the fish-out-of-water theme and offers few surprises but some mild laughs. Witherspoon creates a very credible proto-bimbette, and her dynamic expressions and careful timing wring the most out of every line and reaction. But there isn't anything very challenging about the film's message of \\"Just be yourself\\" as a key to success and happiness -- all fine and good when you have money, beauty, and privilege, as Witherspoon's \\"Elle Woods\\" does.  What Elle is forced to discover in the course of her Harvard Law School adventure is that she has a brain as well, and this along with one massively convenient plot twist after another allows Miss Woods to conquer all by film's end (which is  itself the most outrageously convenient and smiley-faced section of the movie).<br /><br />I'll be generous and grant three stars to \\"Legally Blonde\\" because it is occasionally clever and has a good heart (like our chirpy heroine) and because Witherspoon is a genuine comedic talent -- comparisons being made to a young Goldie Hawn are, if anything, understated, with Reese showing a much wider range at a far younger age.  She is going to have a long and fantastic career, no doubt about it.  But this movie is unchallenging and ultimately as filling as a big hank of cotton candy.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's no solid meal.  And sad to say, in real life, sororities and fraternities are not nearly as egalitarian, supportive,  or sweet-natured as depicted in this fantasyland, and the Elle Woods who reside within them are more likely to be  intolerant, smug, and elitist jerks and bullies -- just like the villains of this picture, not the good guys.  Such is the skewed,  rosey-eyed worldview of \\"Legally Blonde\\" -- no wonder Elle wears so much pink!re, not the good guys.  Such is the skewed,  rosey-eyed worldview of \\"Legally Blonde\\" -- no wonder Elle wears so much pink!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone is a charming movie, just like its conterpart book.  The movie is beautiful and the graphics excellent.  Each of the characters are wonderfully crafted.  My only complaint is that the girl who plays Hermoine is far too pretty.  Hermoine was not a pretty girl. Most importantly, the plot sticks closely to the book.  I was very impressed with the young actors.  They bring the combination of childishness and craft which such roles demand.<br />The DVD is wonderful, with tons of interesting extras.
B00003XB8K|4.0|&quot;Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; is Enigma's fourth wide-release United States album.  It follows on the heels of the mega-hit &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; and more minor hits &quot;Cross of Changes&quot; and &quot;Le roi est mort, Vive le roi!&quot;.  Enigma's trademark has been combining all forms of non-conventional modern music with ancient and tribal music to create a very eclectic sound that is both uplifting and haunting at once.  &quot;MCMXC A.D.&quot; was notable for its introduction of Gregorian monk chants into mainstream music on its blockbuster single &quot;Sadeness&quot;.  &quot;Cross of Changes&quot; continued the trend using the chants while also infusing tribal and Celtic sounds with the music.  On &quot;Cross...&quot;, the most spectacular of all Enigma songs was produced, &quot;The Return to Innocence&quot;.  Enigma continued to evolve its musical range on &quot;Le Roi...&quot; by producing an album that has almost a metaphysically spiritual feel to it (please note, I do not have the credentials, nor vocabulary, to properly describe their music in technical terms.  So, I describe it as it feels).  <BR><BR>   &quot;Screen Behind the Mirror&quot; (which only has 4 stars instead of 5 due to its short run time) takes Enigma's musical evolution one step further.  It employs the use of an orchestral method known as leit motif, which could best be described as using a particular musical theme to characterize and define a larger work.  The most famous use of this technique was used for the musical scores of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies where composer John Williams defined different characters by specific musical tones.  These tones were present in some for or another in every scene that character appeared in.  In this album, Enigma uses composer Carl Orff's &quot;Carmina Burana (O Fortuna)&quot; for its leit motif.  Elements of this amazing orchestral piece flow throughout the entire album, from combinations with the actual music on each track to the bridges between songs.  &quot;Gravity of Love&quot; and &quot;Modern Crusaders&quot; provide early hints of what is to come with &quot;O Fortuna&quot;.  The true star of this album begins just prior to track #8 &quot;Endless Quest&quot; when an ominous hint of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; is played just prior to the start of track #8.  It then flows into &quot;Endless Quest&quot;, which is a slow, deliberate set piece that builds just like the scenes in the movie before its climax.  It builds right until a sudden stop and leap into &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;, which is a shocking, explosive track of that increases the pulse of the music and the listener and it combines thumping drumbeats with soaring guitars and the rousing finale of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; in such a way that the listener can almost imagine Valkyries descending from the sky.  It is truly an amazing musical piece.
6300215814|5.0|This is a great movie.  Really, trully it is.  It's one of those movies you can watch a hundred times over and still get choked up at the end. I know I do.  Of course, you know the screen is just going to light up with Audrey Hepburn, but it's made esspecially good with George Peppard, and all those wonderful people.  In fact, I can't think of a single criticism of this movie.  The music is splendid, the cinema-photgrahy is gorgeous, script is witty, and the plot exciting.  At the end, you want Paul and Holly to end up so badly, you're almost tempted to fast-forward the tape- just to make sure they really do.  <br />Annother thing I enjoy about this movie is that no person is really squeeky clean.  Paul is having an affair, Holly is jumping from man to man, getting herself in bad situations.  In most romance movies, its one person that has the problem, most of of the time never both.  It's sort of refreshing to have a more realistic view of people.<br />Have I mentioned most of everything?  Oh yes, the partys.  This film shows the most terrific partys, everything in this one large rythym, working like a well oiled machine.  You have to see it for yourself.<br />If you have never seen this movie- quick! run out to your local blockbuster or whatever and rent it.  It's calling your name. Can't you hear it? &quot;yooou're naaame! yooou're name!&quot;  If you have, don't you want to see it again?  Just to make sure Cat gets a name, and Holly and Paul, Baby belong to each other?  You had better check.  I know I am.

B0000025T6|5.0|Springsteen's voice is heard loud an clear on this stark, haunting, and powerful narrative.  The characters mostly have fallen on hard luck or cannot deal with their ennui, and their desperation pushes the limits of their existence. Through the pain of &quot;Nebraska&quot; to the overwhelming human power to see truth and find resolve in &quot;Reason to Believe,&quot; Springsteen paints a landscape that will leave the listener breathless.  I was a fan with DARKNESS, but however trite it sounds, NEBRASKA locked me in as a Springsteen Lifer and helped shape some of my philosophy.  His words resound, and he should forever forward be mentioned along with Guthrie, Steinbeck, and Hemingway.  This record will not let you down. Buy it now.
6305069611|2.0|This is certainly not a film for all tastes.  If you like science fiction or David Bowie, go for it.  But I can't say how it might affect you.  My viewing experience was not pure, it was already influenced by a number of factors. <br />What is it about?  Well, it's about an alien from a faraway planet who travels to earth.  Resources on his home planet are depleted and the planet has turned into something resembling the Sahara desert.  TJ Newton is sent to Earth on a mission to find a way to save his planet and its remaining inhabitants. <br />Directed by Nicholas Roeg, the film is strange, arresting, lugubrious, moody, at times annoying, unnerving, and convoluted.  David Bowie was perfect for the role of the alien, T.J. Newton.  His slender (rather, emaciated at the time), boney, bird-like appearance already made him look otherworldly.  Though the book by Walter Tevis is stronger and more moving (it's a fairly short book- definitely worth the read, even more so than seeing the film), the film- despite all its arty direction, is reasonably faithful to the story.  <br />I've seen about 30 minutes of Walkabout, and I think the director sets the same, eerie mood.  The cinematography- the colors and the natural settings (in the desert and the forests)- was ok.  It adequately reflected the sense of isolation felt by Newton himself.<br />Yet, the movie does a very poor job of explaining Newton's purpose, which should have been brought to attention at the beginning.  I can imagine a viewer who hasn't read the book become rather frustrated as to what's happening.  And it's too long.  Some of the scenes are just useless.  The sound quality isn't very good either.<br />So why see it?  There are some very poignant, effective moments.  In effect, it's a story of a stranger coming to a strange land and the intense loneliness and isolation he feels.  Would earthlings really treat TJ Newton the way those in this film did?  It's ultimately a film about emotional connections and detachment.<br />This film I think has a different impact for me, because I saw it conjunction with a number of things- namely, the Walter Tevis book (Tevis also wrote a book called The Hustler, which was turned into a film starring Paul Newman if I'm not mistaken) and David Bowie.  There was uncanny parallel (no doubt why they chose him) b.w Newton and Bowie, his former persona Ziggy Stardust, and b/w the film and his own life at the time.<br />It's an interesting film, but I'd read the book first before considering seeing it.  Sorry, this is a kind of vague recommendation, isn't it?  I think perhaps a less pretentious and well...normal style (whatever that means) of filmmaking would have worked just fine.  In fact the more I think about it, I'd just read the book.
B00005BL2A|1.0|This album was such a disappointment to me. I have seen many reviews exalting this album but I am damn sure that each review of that kind comes from a die-hard DM fan. I used to be a great DM fan. Today I have settled down and am more unbiased towards the bands I used to be crazy about. I only buy an album if it's really good. As for Exciter, the album will remain on the shelves.<br />Depeche Mode really feels the lack of Alan Wilder into the mix. The songs are not melody-friendly and there are no intelligent smart tunes like in \\"Policy Of Truth\\", \\"Freestate\\" or \\"I Feel You\\" and many others. It's difficult to digest this album if you come from the days of Music for the Masses and Violator. <br />The only two songs worth in this album are \\"Dream On\\" and \\"I Feel Loved\\", the rest just brings that strange cold feeling to your stomach that Depeche Mode is not the same it used to be. It's an album that reflects the lack of direction that the band is struggling with.
0780625129|4.0|I was surprise by the good acting performance of Edward Northon, he act totally different from the role he play in movie \\"The People VS Larry Flynt\\", where he play kind of a boring and shy lawyer but this time the role he play as Dereck in this movie is very good, he play a very strong character, I didn't know how good of an actor he was.  Also Edward Furlong acting is good and the story in this movie is very good and very intense.  The end of the movie was surprising and very shocking.
0446677450|5.0|I work with a lot of kids from all sectors of our community. The great majority will grow up to be poor middle class. I was born into the poor middle class and so I know what lies ahead for them. &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; can help the poor middle class to begin to break free from the bondage that they live in.<br />Robert Kiyosaki does not put forth any great formula for building wealth - he can't do that. Poor middle class Americans need to first know that there is a choice for them to make. If Kiyosaki were to give some elaborate plan to build wealth then his audience would not be able to follow it for lack of a foundation of basic financial literacy. Buy this book if you want to be rich - if you already know what Kiyosaki is teaching and you are not rich, then you should buy a book on motivation so you can get out and just do it.<br />I highly recommend buying &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; with &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad.&quot; Together, the books created within me a level of understanding that allowed me to become confident in my understanding of wealth and gave me the skills I needed to acheive wealth. &quot;The Child Whisperer&quot; is about relationships with children, but the most powerful advice in the book deals with how we communicate with ourselves.
B00000GAIW|5.0|Though not my favorite Tull album, it is certainly the one most people identify with the band, and for good reason. Questioning everything from organized religion to society's perception of the the less fortunate, Ian Anderson's song writing comes to full growth on this album. Many called it a concept album, but it was really a great rock album that set the stage for the MOTHER of concept albums, Thick as a Brick. This is a good album to start with if you aren't already into Tull. Just about everyone will recognize the tile track and Locomotive Breath!

1563894696|4.0|... This is a story set in some of the pre-Robin days and Batman where he, Commisioner Gordon and D.A. Harvey Dent are trying to solve the holiday murders. It features a good amount o classic Batman villains and a good retelling of the origin of Two-Face. Jeph Loeb has crafted a good story and Tim Sale's art, though not mind-blowing, is dark and gritty enough to go with the story and give Gotham City a menacing look. These two work well together and this book is proof of that.
B000066744|5.0|\\"The Legend of 1900\\" is a movie unlike almost any other I have seen. It takes place entirely on a ship at sea, but the action spans more than 40 years. It is the story of a musical genius who is born, lives out his life, and ultimately dies on board a grand trans-Atlantic liner in the first half of the 20th century. He watches the world pass him by just a few thousand people at a time, has a fabulous piano-duel with none other than Jelly Roll Morton, is sought after by recording companies, and listens to and learns from the music of all the different cultures who are emigrating from the Old World to the New, but he never once leaves the ship. Indeed, the mere thought of setting foot on land is his ultimate nightmare.<br />I remember having a guest over one evening who was seeing it for the very first time. His reaction (after wiping a tear from his eye) was to exclaim \\"what a wonderful movie! How did anyone even get a film that quirky made?\\" There is no Hollywood 'formula' to this film. It proceeds without any of the usual conventions: no good guy vs. bad guy struggles, no sex, no violence, and no crude jokes. It is like that really good book that you start reading one night when it is already too late but are unable to put down until you have turned the last page.
0553274503|5.0|I wish I could add more stars to my rating, but I'll have to settle with perfection being a mere five stars. I first read this book in my high school English class; I was so impressed with the elegance and humanity in which it was written. Quite honestly, I don't believe I've ever read a better book.<br />I thought the concept of having the novel written in journal entries from Charlie's prospective was excellent. It showed the reader how he progresses and gives the book a more realistic and sensitive feel. True, it may be dull at times, but I think it's well worth sticking out until the end.<br />What I loved most about this book was that it seemed to be a courageous voice whose only message was that it only matters who you are--not what people see you as.<br />I hope you'll give yourself the pleasure of reading FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON but be sure to do so with an open mind. I'm certainly glad that this beautiful novel found its way to me.<br />...
B00000JCB2|1.0|Warning:  to people who appreciate good music, do NOT waste your time with this piece of...  Everything with the cd is just so horrible, I only listened to it because everybody was saying how great they are.  Fred Durst is one of the worst singers I have ever heard.  This band is so incredibly horrible, I did not like one song on here.  They are an un original rap-rock band,...  With all the buzz I was hearing I expected something more, but I was dreadfully wrong, and you do not want to listen to this horrible cd.  It is not even worthy of getting one star in its review, but it's required.  It should be zero stars.  Out of all the bad music that is surfacing and supposedly \\"great,\\" this is by far the worst of the pop-rock bands out.
0385720920|2.0|It seems that many of the reviews for the book are fantastic.  I, for one, was not terribly impressed with the book.  I picked it up expecting something new and creative, but instead, I found that there were a lot of similarities betweeen this book and fight club.<br />Though the book was good, I don't think it belongs on my all-time fave list. I recommend you buy a used version and read it for a chuckle.
B00006690G|1.0|With the exception of maybe two and a half songs this album was completely lacking in style and substance. [btw: that's one good song and maybe three half-good ones] Maybe I was expecting too much because the previous two albums were creative, intelligent and well done. I never listened to the D12 stuff, so I'm not sure if that was any good. I feel like I wasted my money because I bought this without listening to it based on the other albums.
B00005QVVB|5.0|The Robert Altman style, so familiar to moviegoers over the last thirty years, was unleashed from the womb here.  The documentary-style camera work, laying back from the action but given license to zoom in and out as it sees fit, works its wonders best in the operation scenes.  Three tables of patients and doctors, all acting at once, and the camera still manages to capture every piece of relevant information, without making the whole mess confusing.  The overlapping dialogue, which I imagine gave those charged with subtitling the DVD version fits, works in much the same way.  No one would ever confuse \\"M*A*S*H\\" for anything but a Robert Altman film.<br />Despite the absence of battle, \\"M*A*S*H\\" is not devoid of blood.  The surgery sequences are filled to the brim with the red stuff, and serve as a stark contrast to the movie's more goofy comedic moments.  Sometimes within the same scene.  One notable example: Hawkeye, with a note of apprehension on his face, must saw off a wounded man's leg.  After a few strokes back and forth -- complete with cringe-inducing, nails-on-the-blackboard-style sound effects -- he asks the nurse for a clamp.  What for? she asks.  To scratch his nose, he cheekily replies, and the laugh they share perfectly diffuses the horrific moment.  This scene, to me, is \\"M*A*S*H\\" in a nutshell.<br />When thinking of the characters who inhabit \\"M*A*S*H\\"s landscape I am reminded of the realization I had while watching George Cukor's \\"The Philadelphia Story\\".  It's a film that makes its audience root for the stuck-up rich girl and the spoiled rude millionaire layabout, two character types often cast in roles of villainy, while fostering resentment towards a man who earned his fortune by pulling himself up by his bootstraps, usually the hero.  It's a neat trick that that movie pulls off cleanly.  And so does this one.  Hawkeye, Trapper, Duke, et al., are terribly mean men.  They are type-A personalities all, unwillingly to accept anyone who doesn't conform to their lofty, intellectual standards, or their well-developed sense of anarchy.  But just as the humour of the film is a defense mechanism against the insanity of war, this cruelty also serves a purpose.  Anyone without a strong character and an affinity for the kind of team these men are building must be weeded out and destroyed.  It's this realization that allows the audience to sympathize with the tormentors rather than the tormentees.  And it allows you to let down your moralistic guard and like them just the same.<br />Still, there are some moments here that go so far over the line that even a liberal observer like myself, one who can casually accept immorality in movies because art must exist in an amoral state, gasping.  \\"Can I still like these men, given their actions?\\" I often found myself asking.  There are facets of the film that embrace casual sexuality bordering on harassment and casual racism worn as a badge of honour.  An example of the former is the way the men treat Hot Lips, \\"army clown\\" that she is, as an object of both desire and ridicule.  An example of the latter can be found in some of the self-imposed nicknames the men give themselves: Painless Pole, Dago Red, Spearchucker Jones, etc.  True, the obscenity of warfare is a much harsher villain than the obscenities the men practice ('obscenity' is too judgmental a word for my tastes, but I'll let it stand in the absence of anything better), which is why the film is allowed to go to such lengths.  But be warned that much here is designed to make the audience uncomfortable, and to question their beliefs.<br />Balancing this discomfort is a dramatis personae full of characters that are wonderfully likable despite their flaws.  Hawkeye Pierce is probably the most developed character, brought to life by some witty dialogue and some fine acting by then-unknown Donald Sutherland.  Hawkeye is a man of many mannerisms: he calls everyone \\"Babe\\", he's constantly hiding behind his downturned cap and thick spectacles, and, with apologies to Karen Silkwood and Woodward & Bernstein, he's cinema's greatest whistleblower, punctuating each moment with the same simple three-note phrase.  There's a casual elegance that Sutherland brings to Hawkeye (and every other role he's ever played) that shines through even the swampiest of settings here.  Elliott Gould's Trapper is a Zen-like shaggy dog, ravenous in his appetites but dedicated to his surgery.  Gould has a calmness about him that belies the man's manic nature, but it all fits together so well.  Hawkeye and Trapper are one of film's greatest subversive comedy teams; they seem to share a brain, so easily are their plans hatched and executed.<br />The rest of the cast, primarily made up of unknowns, are mostly spotless.  Duvall, as Frank Burns, brings dignity and composure to a man who is supposed to be inept as a surgeon and as a man.  Sally Kellerman is loud and abrasive and stiff as Hot Lips Houliahan, a woman who, despite her sexy exterior, is supposed to be loud and abrasive and stiff.  Tom Skerritt brings some southern charm, and a hint of incongruity, to Duke Forrest, Hawkeye and Trapper's cohort in cruelty.  Roger Bowen, Rene Auberjonois, Gary Burghoff, John Schuck and Bud Cort all get about the same amount of screentime, fill up the backgrounds admirably, and do yeoman's work when they're called to the front.<br />Robert Altman, a director whose work and style I've never been able to give my heart to, managed to craft a wonderfully satiric and entertaining little anti-war picture, that I can wholeheartedly endorse.  To top off this particularly tasty confection, he's added one of the most self-aware closing credit sequences ever put on film.  They are meta-credits, if you'll allow me to coin a phrase.  \\"Attention,\\" comes the squawk of the loudspeaker, \\"tonight's movie has been 'M*A*S*H'.\\"  Before introducing the ensemble, Altman and Co. soften the blow and provide one final laugh.
0748662979|5.0|Oh, how I'm enjoying the continuing series in the story of Mma. Ramotswe, owner of The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency in Botswana, Africa!  I love this strong African woman who is proud of who and what she is and where she is from and I'm highly entertained by the clients and other characters that she comes across.  <br />\\"We help people with the problems in their lives.  We are not here to solve crimes,\\" Mma. Ramotswe tells one client.  Not your average detective, she and her staff of one (Mma. Makutsi, her secretary turned-assistant detective) help people from different backgrounds with varied problems.  Mma. Ramotswe even has a personal problem to resolve when her fiancée (Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, owner of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors) starts acting in a strange manner without warning or reasoning.<br />I like the way the author brings out the close relationship between Mma. Ramotswe and Mr. Matekoni.  The couple chooses to address each other formally but it is done in the context of respect, affection and love. The mannerisms and dialog between the other characters show the reader some of the cultural nuances in that part of the world.  <br />The issue of morality -- how people treat each other, forgiveness, helping others -- comes up as the detectives work.  On a job assignment, Mma. Makutsi goes in search of a beautiful girl with morals for a beauty pageant(hence the title). Mma. Ramotswe wrestles with the idea of whether some of her methods of detective work are moral.<BR>  <BR>Set to a vivid background of the dry but beautiful land of Botswana with its great Braham bulls and colorful people, Alexander McCall Smith describes scenes that remind me of the picturesque movies like OUT OF AFRICA and I DREAMED OF AFRICA.  <br />MORALITY FOR BEAUTIFUL GIRLS is another fun book to read.  <br />Fafa Demasio
0679777547|5.0|_The Club Dumas_ is, without a doubt, one of the best books I've ever read. It's the story of Lucas Corso, a mercenary (please forgive my misspellings) of the book world, and the strange things that happen to him once he obtains an original copy of a chapter of _The Three Musketeers_ (&quot;The Anjou Wine&quot;) and the extremley rare book &quot;The Nine Doors&quot;. My summary doesn't sound too exciting, but this is an amazing book.<br />I bought this book after seeing the movie &quot;The Nine Gates&quot; (Johnny Dep). The movie left much to be desired, but not the book. The movie is soley about the book, &quot;The Nine Doors&quot;, but it plays a different part in the book. The book has many twists and turns, many pretaining to literature, et al, and is the sort of thing most people would enjoy, surprisingly. I am usually able to predict book/movie endings with fair accuracy, but this book took me by surprise time and time again. Don't miss this one!
0425074811|1.0|This is a sneaky book. Von Daniken expends most of his energy attacking the supposed close-mindedness of the scientific establishment. This tactic predisposes the reader to want to disprove him -- to demonstrate that he or she is open-minded and willing to consider facts that don't agree with a pet theory. This makes the reader let down his or her guard, afraid to question von Daniken's evidence. His evidence? A few dozen seemingly anomalous finds linked together with a liberal helping of speculation and a heavy reliance on arguments from incredulity and a refusal to believe in any coincidence whatsoever. If you insist on reading this book, be as skeptical of his accusations of close-mindedness as you are of his theories (or any theories, for that matter).
6303394000|5.0|After more then 16 years of Bob Fosse death, his movies are still touching and do not age at all. Why - Because, simply both the characters and plots are above down-to-earth experiences. It is about life, death, love, hate and most of all music and dance. ALL THAT JAZZ is about all those things, but it is the music and dance that delivers the message. You can see this movie once and be surprised how close it is to your own thinking of life and death. You see it 100 times and you still realize that you have not understand it all. Bob gives his life on the tray. THIS IS REAL MOVIE, REAL HISTORY. period. And this is why it is so great. No \\"please-the audience-numbers\\". Throughout the entire movie, you have a real story and real man. This is Bob, but it is also you with all your dreams and fears. What is great about this film, is not the story-line, music, dance or Jessica Lange. IT IS YOU IN THIS MOVIE.  You simply identify yourself with the main character (not that all of us are SOB directors - but he is so human) and then you are flown to the next level of understanding. It simply shows you the universal side of the human nature. Regardless your history and experience. Afraid of death? Thought about how it actually happens? Do you care?<BR>Well, see it and I bet you would say - \\"That's what I think, but nobody before expressed it better\\". This is a movie made by the guy obssesed with sex and death. But sex and death in this movie are only the metaphor of something deeper.<br />Is the best Bob's film ever<BR>And if you wait until the final scene - that's the way I want to die !!!!
B00005JKLZ|3.0|At best, Time Machine was a worthwhile Saturday watch. The effects were top rate and very convincing worthy of even George Lucas' ILM stamp of approval (althought the f/x were done by another company).As a previous viewer commented, it was painful to watch Guy Pearce's performance in some scenes. He either displayed \\"wooden emotions\\" or he tried a bit too hard. Also, his appearance looked gaunt and very tired in the first 30 to 40 minutes of the film. The ending or fading out of the film had a sort of Titanic feel with overlapping the past and future together in one particular melancholy scene. Despite the advances in special effects over the past 40 years since the original, the 1960 version will always be the best and is definitely a classic. In addition, the 1960 release produced some very grotesque and terrifying images with regards to the underground dwellers (the Morlocks; who can forget their yellow glowing eyes and savage growls)! However, what was admirable in the new version was the introduction of actor Jeremy Irons' intellectually sinister character role ! To hear him say his lines was like hearing his voice all over again from The Lion King playing the evil Scar. Showing that although the human future race was near extinction the existence of a multi-ethnic population was still possible (unlike the original). What I kept yearning for was more adventuresome exploring by the time traveller before he would finally advance to 800,000 years into the future. Also, it would have been fascinating if the writers or director would have gone the H.G. Wells route where supposedly the time traveller goes so far into the future that the entire planet is near total destruction (possibly leaving the traveler lingering in outerspace). This was the room for potential I was talking about!
0345349571|5.0|With A Distant Mirror Tuchman has created a fascinating portrait of late-medieval Europe. She uses the life and career of a wealthy and talented French noble to give us a view of the principal events of the fourteenth century through the eyes of a contemporary. By doing this Tuchman not only provides herself with manageable material, but also depicts the historical narrative from the inside out, rather than from the outside in. Many historians have attempted to do this, but Tuchman is the first to avoid the trap of subjectivity.<br />In addition to following the life and times of one person, Tuchman spends a large portion of the book illustrating the setting in which the story takes place. No other writer has depicted the troubles of the changing weather patterns and plague that brought about the chaos of the late-medieval period with the passion and humanity that Tuchman has. Tuchman has also endeavored to show life and history as they happened for peasants, serfs, and the urban poor in a way that is meaningful to the rest of the material.<br />Finally, I would like to say that A Distant Mirror could make a great positive impact on the way history (as both the finite past and something that is always happening) is understood if it were used in schools -- and that is the highest praise I can give.
B0000683DH|5.0|I know that \\"director's editions\\" of films are really nothing more than a clever ploy to get you to buy the same [darn] film over and over again (case in point: I have all of the Trek films on both VHS and DVD already), but I just couldn't contain myself when I heard the \\"director's edition\\" of _Wrath of Khan_ was coming out. This version of _Khan_ clears up the whole question of Scotty's concern for \\"Engineer's Mate, Peter Preston\\" (what: I'm the only person who was bothered by it!?) with extra footage that was left out of the theatrical release: Peter was Scotty's sister's youngest son (which makes him Scotty's nephew, right?)!<br />The addition of more personal loss involving someone besides Spock or Kirk or McCoy (even though it is quickly forgotten among Kirk's family issues) makes the series come even more alive for me than before (and also adds some poignancy to Scotty's sympathetic distance in III when David is killed by those \\"Klingon bastards.\\")<br />Even though the \\"director's edition\\" only amounts to a few extra minutes of (all-be-it important) dialogue, when teamed with Michael Okuda's text commentary (funny and insightful \\"Trek nerd stuff\\" if ever I've read it!) and the second disc's wonderful interviews and material surrounding the ascendency of Khan in our imaginations, it becomes well worth the money. If you're a fan of this film, you'll love seeing the extra footage!
B000069HKH|5.0|I loved Born To Run way back when, and tolerated Born in the USA, but I'm not really a Boss fan.  The Rising has changed that.  This Album is everthing I hoped it would be and more--powerful, singable, great music.  Bruce proves again he can write songs with the best of them, his band can play with the rest of them (though I'd have like some more Sax and Piano and less Max Weinberg), and he can top the charts.  I've got this CD in both of my car and my wife has it in hers.  Best album I've heard in the past 5 ot 10 years.
0385503954|5.0|McEwan has crafted an epic around the unfortunate events that befall the main characters Briony Tallis, her sister Cecilia, Robbie Turner and Lola.  A horrible set of events begin to spiral further out of control as a result of Briony's adolescent interpretation of those events and her subsequent personal judgments and decisions relating to them.  Once committed this sequence of acts cannot be undone and thus begins a lifetime in which the \\"original sin\\" becomes the common thread that weaves through the remainder of each character's life.  On one level it is a story about the loss of innocence and the life long implications of that loss.  On another level it chronicle the realities of human frailty.  And finally, the story shows the impact of a crime on the innocent.    <br />From the gripping scene at the family home on a hot day in the summer of 1934 to the graphic description of war torn northern France in 1939 and 1940, this book is compelling. McEwan's plot and descriptive skills are intricate and powerful.  The oily smoke rising from Dunkirk as France fell and the military hospital scenes are memorable examples. The descriptions of pre-Blitz London are uncanny.  The reader can feel the approaching doom.  While I did not expect it, this book was hard to put down.  The reader is swept into a sensation of wanting to see how a particular scene or exchange will end or how a relationship will develop.  And, of course, throughout there is a sense that the \\"other shoe\\" will drop at any moment.  <br />At a human level this book is an illustration of life's many ironies.  I have read many reviews that found the complexity and drama of the relationships here to be unreal.  On the contrary, I found them highly plausible.  McEwan is simply able to capture these sentiments and, perhaps, because it is so infrequently done in modern literature, some find it \\"unreal\\".  In \\"Atonement\\" the wronged are not vindicated and those who have wronged either seek a life of \\"atonement\\" orappear not to pay any price for their transgressions or crimes.  Perhaps the original crimes have motivated a life of \\"good\\".  But then again can \\"good\\" be a viable outcome from a crime?  Isn't there always collateral damage to real people however unintended?  That is for the reader to decide.   These are the irony's of life and thus, I choose to see this wonderful novel as a vivid lesson.  Be honest in your understanding of relationships and intentions.  Be mindful of how others may interpret events.  Be willing to admit mistakes.  Know right from wrong.  Do not bow to pressure from others when you know your heart tells you otherwise.  Don't underestimate the power of love.  Be human.<br />Finally, the book is simply very well written.  I often found myself saying of the author; \\"How does he do it?  This total command of the details; this almost biologic weaving of the plot; this otherworldly wisdom.  How does he do it?\\"  Ian McEwen has done it without question and it is worth reading because it will cause the reader to become more human.  And that is an extraordinary contribution.
B000006ZL4|4.0|I admit, that when I got this album, I had incredibly high expectations and most of them were met. The songs were long enough and drove pretty well, and the vocals were not the usual castrated sounding ones from other bands (you know who they are). The guitars and keyboards were very good as well, but the more I listened to it, the more I sensed something was missing. This is probably due to the fact that I am a huge Dream Theater fan, but there was something else that did not finally hit me until I popped in Kamelot's new disc, Karma. Compared to the songs on said disc, these seemed rather empty, more like frames for the guitar/keyboard solos and the vocals. (I should probably note that this is the only Symphony X album I currently own.) For example, a song like DT's Change of Seasons. Even at over twenty minutes, it never sounds empty. Maybe it is the production job since I have never heard these guys live. Another thing is that the guitar/key interplay seems so predictable, one right after the other. On the other hand, the bass and drum work is very good, setting and keeping the pace very well. One thing in which this disc shines, are the epics, namely the Acolade and the title track. While they are long ,they are also expansive so they don't seem as empty as the others. The ballad tacked onto the end is also excellent for the above reasons and is a fine way to close the disc. So, over all, these guys are good and more importantly different from a lot of other power metal bands but they need to work on some things.
0609610570|4.0|Execution reminded me of the old maxim that common sense isn't.  The best plan isn't worth more than the paper it's written on unless it's executed well, and this is something Execution's writers strive to keep in mind throughout the book.  I found it well-written, constantly arguing that execution is vital.  It's almost as good as Michael Levine's Guerilla PR: Wired, which deals with low-cost methods of highly successful public relations strategies.
B00005YXZH|5.0|i went to tower looking for something that was very easy to listen to and enjoy and an album that was pretty much perfect. albums like that aren't really all that easy to come by, but rolling stone really liked this one and i figured i should at least try it, so i listened to a minute of i am trying to break your heart and figured that it was enough for me. when i put it in and heart the rest of the album, i was extremely impressed, and after having it for a week and a half, i really love it. it's probably one of my favorite records, and i have a lot of records. i would say easily and accurately that this album is a total headphone record and really isnt the same without some big studio phones. get set up, sit on your bed and relax with this album, cause that's what it's for and it's just that good.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is one of my favorites movies. At the end of the film you'll realize that the performance of the actors is beyond what you were watching in the screen.<br />Like in a novel, you would try to find out the guilty one (who is and where he is), but indeed there is much more to find and to see in the story. The scenes of violence that you watch in the trailer don't mean that's what the movie is all about. Not at all. This movie does not depend on special effects or the like to have you enjoying it in your seat. I highly recommend it.<br />...

And the experimental style is really a bit of a cover, inside these songs are some fairly straightforward folk strains of english music.<br />&quot;Dark Side&quot; has a sound and style that is a knotch beyond most popular music.

B00005OAIE|5.0|In my opinion, John Mayer is 23 year old Diamond from Moon.  His vocals are pure and original; guitar playing is smooth and seemingly effortless; arrangements are tasteful;  Lyrics are elegant; and progressions are colorful and creative.  I'm honestly shocked that so many people on this message board have the audacity to compare John Mayer to Dave Matthews Band.  The only thing my well listened and trained ear can pick from Mayer's music which reminds me of DMB is \\"musical durability and an unobstructed road to success.\\"<br />John's dynamic musical intuition unquestionably earns him a status to rival that of many celebrated Jazz composers; his voice and lyrics are enough to make 99.9% of those composers green with envy.  He'd certainly make the Duke grin, applaud and call for more!  John Mayer guitar playing is acrobatic and effortless.  Strangely, many of his rhythms and chord progressions did at first glance feel easy with a touch childlike simplicity... Upon closer inspection, I've concluded those same progressions are intricate, thought out and heavily textured with a spice of exotic notes, chords, and rhythms.  That notion of simplicity I felt was Mayer's brilliance saying, &quot;Look how easy this is!&quot;  While I, and I'm sure many others stand on the side grumbling under our breath &quot;Right John, easy, maybe for you...&quot;  <br />John's musical engine is the the ANTI-(BRITTNEY, BACK-STREET BOYS, EMINEM etc).  He's got the steam to rival this current plastic boy toy, Barbie girl pop frenzy.  His genius is exactly the fire that will eventually melt through that phony-balony facade created by production engineers, fashion designers, marketing experts and record executives.  Listen to this CD and ask yourself one thing, &quot;Can a talent like John Mayer's be powdered and polished like one of those karaoke-kids on American Idol &quot;Search for a Superstar?&quot;  Talent like John Mayer's can't be dismissed from the stage, or voted off of the set, or shaken up by some pompous Judge.  It can only be appreciated, embraced and celebrated.  <br />One ubiquitous trait I love about Composers like John Mayer, is their perpetual desire to grow, change, experiment, take risks and stretch the limits of their craft.  It's that characteristic which is always responsible expanding the boundaries of music as we know it.  Mark my words, &quot;This is only the beginning.&quot;
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Watching this classic on DVD, you could be sitting in a cinema in 1937 watching the original release.  Prepare for sensorary overload with this double disc, digital renovation of a timeless American classic.<br />Everyone knows the classic fairy tale story of the princess and the seven dwarfs, so there's nothing new I can say there, but I can garuntee you've never seen it looking anything like this.  If you're used to having seen the movie on video, prepare for a shock: the outlining of the characters, the colour of the animation, the backgrounds, and the overall setup of the picture are so well defined on DVD, it will leave you awestruck.<br />And that's only the beginning: the audio commentary is precise and EXTREMELY informative with excerpts of archived interviews with Disney himself, (if you ask me, there's nothing more disappointing than a classic movie with a rambling, aimless DVD commentary)  The only audio commentary I'm aware of to be equal to this is on the Godfather series.  The making of featurette charts Dinsey's history from the simple &quot;Laugh-O-Grams&quot; to his ambitiousplans for an animated feautre.  Watch out for the foreign translation clips of the Dwarfs varying names in different countries.  Also on the second disc, is at least five deleted scenes partially animated (including a full colour scene of the witch at her couldron)  And you may have to delve further to find it, but also included is the original transcript of the Grimm Brother's fairy-tale.<br />Dinsey's high regard in which it regards itself is all too evident in the &quot;Dinsey through the decades&quot; feature (there's no mention of The Black Couldron here) as presenters blissfully glide over the company's impending bankruptcy druing the mid-eighties.<br />Still, this is a DVD &quot;Experience&quot; not to be missed.  Dinsey will soon recall these limited edition DVD's in time for the re-release of Beauty and the Beast, after this, it won't be available on DVD or video for the next 10 years!  No cinema classic has been better restored or better respected in it's wealth of bonus features.  <br />If your intrested in other classic movies on DVD, I highly recommend Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo.
B000066NW0|5.0|The album as of writing this review, has not been released in this country and will not be until October, and I am proud to own this incredible CD by such a talented young artist in Avril Lavigne. Her songs are characterised by real emotion, and really captures the essence of her life, whether they be anger, sadness, or happiness. Hey style, despite not being entirely original, does not follow bubblegum pop conventions, and I think this steers the album into something that transcends culture and language that is both refreshing and surprising to listen to. Avril writes her own songs and plays her own instruments, and in light of that, I hope that Ms. Spears looks at this great new artist and starts kickin holes in the walls. <br />Her acoustic (Tomorrow), hard guitar riffed (Losing Grip, Sk8r Boi, and Unwanted), and Pop (Complicated) sounds are great to listen to. Overall, fantastic album.

B000003BEM|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said about this classic album? The Stones given up on flower power and decided to return to their roots.  Yet, the boys delved deeper into there influences, with more respect and authority than they had ever attempted.  \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is a timeless piece of music, that can hardly be classified as anything but The Rolling Stones. \\"No Expectations\\" , my personal favorite cut, is the kind of perfectly understated mature song that everysongwriter wishes they could write.  \\"Dear Doctor\\" borders on a country parody, but you can tell that they are sincere to a genre they hold so dear, putting their own flavor on to a relativaly basic country tune, in turn making it their own. \\"Parachute Woman\\" is gritty badly recorded blues at its finest, the lack of gloss on the album is what makes it so charming, and so authentic.\\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\" is the only weak track on the whole record, the stones are not good with Dylan-isms, but the backing music is great, and that famous rock-funk Watts drumming debuts here. \\"Street Fighting Man\\" is alright, but i dont really care for it now. \\"Prodigal Son\\" is perfect in the same way as \\"No Expectations\\" is, they did what the needed to and by not going overboard they managed to make another blues standard their very own. \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is the kind of sleazy rock the stones would perfect later on, and the lyrics must have sounded unbelievable at the time. \\"Factory Girl\\" another original country-folk tune complete with a fiddle, beautifully played and sung. \\"Salt of the Earth\\" a great gospel-tinged ode to the working man rounds out this classic record beautifully.
B000065U1N|5.0|The story, cinematography, special effects, all beautifully made, come toguether in this highly realistic film about a true battle of modern war. The movie sheds light and makes us remember <BR>the most intense battle fought by US forces since the vietnam war. As author Mark Bowden writes about what happened after: the battle was consider neither victory nor defeat, it just didnt matter. That is what I beleive sets this movie apart from Saving Private Ryan or other great war films, this entire horrific story actually happened, real men died fighting for a cause their country had sent them to, and in the end the cause, the battle and their country simply forgot what happened. The movie shows you that horrific battle with details of what those brave men did for their country with some doing heroic acts that went beyond the call of duty and they were all real.
B000068PQ0|5.0|First off, if you're the type who gets his hackles up whenever a band changes traditional styles, you'll probably be unable to allow yourself access to this disc. It's a significant departure, musically, from previous Lips albums.<BR>It's hard for me to describe this disc. Obvious observations would be: electronica, psychedelia, pop, lighthearted, melodic. The music and accompanying vocals merge together gracefully and poignantly, with basslines and pleading, soothing vocal strains that insituate themselves into your brain. Wayne Coyne is a gentle spirit in an arena of otherwise swaggering, aloof artists. You feel like he cares deeply about things, and isn't concerned about coming off cool. That quality alone gets my attention. It makes the disc like a friend, who's there to skip stones with you and enjoy the breeze. It's uplifting and personal, and my favorite Lips album to date.<BR>For those who've never heard them, I'd compare the overall feel of this music to something like Kid A (if Thom Yorke were happy), or maybe a more subtle and modern Deee Lite.<BR>Anyway, I'd recommend buying it and listening to it at least several times, and I don't recommend a lot of stuff.
B0000029GA|5.0|definitely the best nas album ever this album is classic one of the greates hip hop albums ever but i have to say i like reasonable doubt better (not taking anything away from nas)
B000002UAR|4.0|The usual high quality of The Beatles, plus the start of the search for something beyond the music they know they have already mastered.<br />The new Beatles sound is defined in Tomorrow never knows and Eleanor Rigby: just expect the unexpected. And it applies as well to the young rock'n roll listeners in the 60s as to listeners of the early albums of The Beatles.<br />Try the songs and enjoy it.
B000069CWE|5.0|Hybrid Theory was a cd i thought could NEVER be topped, but Linkin Park showed, with this album, that they can make something that is already perfect into extraordinary!  They didn't change the songs completely, as many artists today are doing, they just changed a couple of words and mixed the songs differently.  I know some people think that original songs are the only way to go, but this record proves all that WRONG!  I was very unsure of how this album would be, but i am beyond impressed!  TOTALLY worth the money!
0780626966|5.0|Ok, you've seen the movies before. You know about them, they are all great horror, scary with creative killings and some comedy. The picture and sound is all great. Now, on to business.<BR>The 8th disc, The Nightmare Encyclopedia has 93 videos and 3 still galleries on it. It is broken into 3 parts: Primetime, The Labyrinth and Index. In the index you are can view special features and don't have to look at them in the labyrinth. Primetime is a collection of the special features mostly. The Labyrinth is a maze type game where you must search for special features that are both in the index, and also not in the index. All in all there is 3.5 hours of special features on this disc. Now, the maze is somewhat tricky, but don't listen to the hype that it is the hardest thing in the world. I did it myself in one short sitting. It was made so everyone could see the features, you just had to work for them a bit. It isn't as hard as everyone said. Basically it is just an innovative way to get your special features rather than the normal more boring way. If you have trouble with this, maps of the labyrinth are available online and so is info and directions. <BR>There are cool things within the labyrinth as well that aren't special features but may as well be (ie: pictures of things on the walls). <BR>The booklet that comes with this is info and pics based on the kits theatres were given when the movie came out. Everything about this box set is great and truly sets the standards for box sets to come in the future.
B000069CWE|4.0|Hey Hey, Linkin Park is finally out with something new. Titled \\"Reanimation\\", this new album is not what Linkin Park fans really expected. We've all heard those old \\"Hybrid Theory\\" songs too many times, and \\"Reanimation\\" just further enhances those old songs to make them sound new. Well, they should have come out with this album a long time back, and should have now got hold of some new songs!!<BR>Overall its not bad, but its pretty much the same old stuff!!Period.
B00000I8UK|5.0|This Blue Note album represents what I feel is Eric Dolphy's most revolutionary work on disc. Throughout most of his career, Dolphy had one foot in the avant-garde and one foot in the bop tradition. In many ways, Dolphy was the most Bird-like saxophonist of his generation, but Bird with a twist. Much of his output as a leader was done with rather traditional rhythm section ensembles. Out to Lunch marked a break with that. <br />The rhythm section work on this album is exceptional. Richard Davis manages to play with the time and still keep it grounded. Tony Williams was at his best in this kind of music, creating landscapes with his drums. Listen to his interplay with Davis and Hutcherson. They are all over each other and yet the groove never gets lost. <br />Two players on this album are not usually associated with the avant-garde of the 60s, Freddie Hubbard and Bobby Hutcherson. And yet both deliver what might be considered their best work, especially Hutcherson. He plays with the adventurousness of Herbie Hancock and yet, because of the unique properties of the vibes, the sound is lighter, freer and less modal than a piano based ensemble would be. <br />Last but greatest of all is Dolphy. In this album, his unique abilities really shine, both as a composer and as a soloist. Dolphy was bridging the supposed gap between the \\"New Thing\\" players and the boppers long before people like Arthur Blythe, or Anthony Braxton started playing standards again. Dolphy is wild and wooly one minute and swinging the next. Dolphy was always master of his musical situation, even as a sideman. But with him in front of a band of his own choosing, the results are incandesent. <br />If you only get one Dolphy album, this is the one to get. It shows were jazz might have gone, had he not died so young. It would have been amazing!
B0000683DH|5.0|After receiving The Director's Edition of TMP for Christmas, I was hoping that the series would continue.  Pleasantly, I was not disappointed.  Nor am I disappointed with this remarkable DVD.  All of the material which was added for the film's network showings are here - some of which I remember vividly, others I did not remember.  TWOK has always been my favorite Original Series film, not because of the fantastic battle sequences and plot, but for one of the underlying themes of the film:  Is a victory (or sucess) really a victory if it means sacrificing a beloved friend and comrade?<BR>As for the second disc which contains all of the bonus material, the interviews (past and present) had me totally engrossed.  Yet, Shatner, Nimoy, and Montalban are showing their age.  It was fun seeing De Kelley in the retro interview section.  It is unfortunate that he is no longer with us to see the franchise continue to flourish.  I think someone should be commissioned to give Dr. Leonard \\"Bones\\" McCoy the send off he so richly deserves.  I absolutely loved this DVD and eagerly await the same treatmentfor Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.
6304493681|1.0|You know, guys, part of the reason that anime is not taken seriously by the populace at large is that people like you keep insisting that awful stuff like this is great, brilliant, sheer art, the form at its best.  Is it just that you have no critical thinking abilities, or is it that your brains just for some reason shut off when presented with Japanese animation?  Regardless, the truth will out: this is a plodding (god knows how they got an eighty-minute film to plod, but there you are), pretentious, and terribly dull piece of work.<br />In many ways, Ghost in the Shell reminded me of The Matrix, another bad film that put style wholly over subtance, and deserves to be mercilessly ridiculed for its obvious and oh-so-shallow stabs at 'depth.'  I'm not saying that it would have been impossible to make a decent film built around the hoary old 'what does it mean to be human?' cliche this is emphatically not that film (that film would be Tezuka's Metropolis, which is polite enough to at least not beat you over the head with it).  And, regrettably, the shalowness of the philosophy is only matched by that of the characters, removing another element by which the film could have been made to appeal.  Do the action scenes succeed, then?  No.  They are dull and poorly paced, with no really feeling of excitement at any point.<br />To be fair, it's not all bad: some of the visuals are sort of decent, and the soundtrack is good (the ending theme is apparently by U2 and Brian Eno...whaddaya know about that?).  These are nowhere near enough to overcome the film's prevailing badness, though.  Not recommended to anyone.
B00005R62K|5.0|Judas Priest rose to high popularity in the beginning of the '80s by the expansion of NWOBHM, so I think their earlier classic works have got lost a bit beside the records of that era. But this album is a star-turn of their career. <br />   What's striking at first and is the virtue of 'Stained Class' is the complexity of the songs that the later albums lacked in this measure. I even risk to say it contains some of the ever-greatest epic works of Heavy Metal, like 'Stained Class', 'Beyond The Realms Of Death' or 'Saints In Hell'. And not forgetting the double-bass drummed hellfast thunder of 'Exciter', true Speed Metal from 1978! - with a magnificient drum-intro exhausting later many times (f.e. 'Riding On The Wind', 'Painkiller', 'Machine Man'). The bizarre and brutal riffs of 'Saints In Hell' were conceived in an extreme manner that wasn't spread until the nineties.<BR>  <BR> The guitarists - mainly Glenn - are doing some of their most memorable and finest solo-works with capturing melodies and atmosphere, but I must emphasize the mighty and striking, rather versatile riffs, too - some of them are also among the best and heaviest Priest ever created. I don't miss to mention the excellent drumming of Les Binks (my personal favourite), who was also the most creative drummer of Priest, because though he wrote only one song, all the memorable that is: 'Beyond The Realms Of Death' (though I would lie if I said its main distorted riff doesn't resemble too much the one of Mountain's 'Thumbsucker' from their LP 'Avalanche'.) And even more on this album Priest finally reached a faultless and powerful sound (not forgetting it is 1978!). By the way its cover shows first that well-known angular Judas Priest logo. <BR>  <BR> 'Stained Class' was the final argument that proved: this band was predestined to be a long time vanguard of heavy music.
B000001FKY|5.0|This is the lowest point of what was a promising heavy metal career. Def Leppard was a great new band when they released &quot;On through the night&quot; in 1980. This is just empty garbage. I know that the drummer lost his arm and it took guts to stay in the band, so the drum machine can be forgiven. The synths however,cannot. Their is no guitar on this album. They have all died and gone to keyboard hell! The lyrics are not even funny! This is the most brainless attempt at cracking the top 40 I've ever heard. Why can't they play heavy metal again? This dosen't even have the heart of hair bands like Ratt or Dokken. How low will Leppard sink before they call it a day? Well...just check out their new album &quot;X&quot; to see what I mean. Now their more then just bubblegum, their trying to be alternative too. Goody. They need to figure out that having a record that's ten times platinum dosen't mean their doing well. Anyone can become record company puppets.
B000066JES|3.0|I was a true swedish ManOwaR fan during the 80's from the first record to 'Sign of the Hammer'. When ManOwaR released 'Fightning the World' I was put down. In my opinion the band had giving in to the forces of commersialism and played music bordering on false metal. I didn't pick up a new record until a heard a sample of 'The Triumph of Steel'. Well, they no longer played false metal alright but it didn't sound like the classical ManOwaR, more like contemporary death metal. And I could't come to terms with the fact that Scott Columbus and Ross the Boss had left the band since the late 80's. Now, I always have liked and loved the classical ManOwaR period and continued to listen to the classical four (Battle Hymns, Into Glory Ride, Hail to England and Sign of the Hammer). When they released the two live albums in the late 90's, 'Hell on Wheels' and 'Hell on Stage', althought I only heard samples, I was stunned by the power and impact of the energy and sound. They really did justice to the classical songs and played the newer material in a more true way, and as a bonus Scott was back in the band! In my opinion, a band is defined by it's live acts and a good live record. Well the band put out two really good live records on a row, again showing their balls while standing up towards the record industry. ManOwaR really showed their love for their fans and I quickly fell in love again, in time for their new studio release.<BR>   What can I say about 'Warriors of the World'. I have listened to it repetively during the last day or so. My first impression was: \\"Oh my, what a strange record!\\" Now I say: \\"What balls to put this diverse kind of material together!\\" It's still a stange record but it really grows in a short moment of time. It's not a masterpeace however, not compared to the classical ManOwaR era anyway (ManOwaR can't be compared to other acts because of the originality of the band).<BR>   The first notes on the opening song 'Call to Arms' is reminicent of the bandTherion (a Swedish act (which by the way did a cover of Thor (The Powerhead) on their recent album) distinguised by its gothic sound and use of choirs). The rest is reminecent of 'Blood on My Enemies'. It is monotone, primitive with a heavy ponding rythm, supported by classical ManOwaR lyrics. A really good song filled with honor and dark ambience.<BR>   Right away from the second song the record takes a drasticly different direction. 'The Fight for Freedom' is really a song for Americans and the patriotic sentimens strikes discordia in my being. Besides a quite o.k. chorus, the rest of the song is totally uninteresting. I have really thought of ManWaR not as a patriotic band towards an existing country but towards their own legions of Army of Immortals. What can I say, a strike of false metal?<BR>   From the third song the record travels on uncharted territory. The very personal interpretation of the classical act 'Nessun Dorma' is the kind of thing that really evokes my respect for the band. It is in the tradition of Joey's muscular bass solo numbers that has become a tradition on almost every album. Now it is time for Eric Adams to show the abilities of his voice, and it's an equal match to Joey's thunderpicks! I really like the closing of the song with the heavy chord and screaming heavy metal voice, which show the humor of the band. A nice break from the seriousness that sometimes can affect this band.<BR>   'Valhalla' is actually dedicated to me as a Swedish resident. It's quite a ordinary electronic overture which fits nicely with the next song 'Swords in the Wind'. This song is a really good ManOwaR ballad, filled with Norse mythology, death and honor, everyting that one can ask from ManOwaR. The heavy section fits in nicely and all in all this will become a true classical ManOwaR act.<BR>   Just as everyone expects the rest of the album develope according to classical ManOwaR lines the band instead chooses to do a cover of the song 'An American Triology' filled with strong american sentiments, again to strong for my taste. However, the closing heavy metal riffs eases the mood. The somewhat self-ironic tone of the song makes the band excused. It can be proof of their balls to do what they feel like to do. It remains, however, that the song isn't going to be one of my favorites.<BR>   The next composition, 'The March' is a tribute to Richard Wagner, with nice electronic ambience of a orchestral flavour. As I am into Wagner myself, I can easely go along for the trip. Somehow this is a prelude to the last 1/3 section of the record which ends in heavy death metal ambience. The last four songs is really worth the buy of the record in their own right.<BR>   'Warriors of the World United' is a good ponding and heavy track in the tradion of the opening act. It is somehow reminicent of classical Judas Priest but that isn't to obvious to be a flaw by itself. It will become a good live track, I am sure.<BR>   The last three songs are of the same kind, heavy, fast and raw metalmania. The ambience is dark, bordering on death metal, with classical dark ManOwaR lyrics. 'Hand of Doom' is the best track on the album and probably one of the best overall songs in the carrier of ManOwaR. 'House of Death' and 'Fight Until We Die' is almost as good and already classical ManOwaR acts. This is the kind of ManOwaR we expect to hear in the 21'st century.
B00000IMTF|5.0|Rainbow was the best Deep Purple spin-off band next to Whitesnake. The music was well written and boasted a superb lineup of musicians. Dio became famous for his work in this band. Sadly, this group is underated in 70's metal. &quot;Rising&quot; was their best record. The cover art is great. If you like DIO or Purple, you need to discover Rainbow.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Don't listen to it expecting them to be the next beatles... there not... you have to remember this is only there first cd and its a pretty great first cd... look at the beatles first cd it wasnt even close to there best cds, the strokes have a lot of potential and i look forward to there sophmore album
B000002KKS|5.0|This was the best Sabbath album since \\"Sabotage\\". Ozzy was so wrapped up in his substance abuse, he couldn't even sing worth a damn. Enter Ronnie James Dio. The legend behind Elf, Rainbow, and his own classic band. This was the tightest Sabbath slab in ages. Dio used his song writing to bring this band back from the grave. His lyrics were way better then Geezer Butler's ever were.<BR>Dio sings circles around Ozzy. Classic songs. This was the album that restored Sabbath. Sadly, the band would slump lower then ever after RJD left in '82.
0440219078|5.0|When I was assigned to read this book in my literature class, I was very skeptical.  My teacher kept saying, \\"It's kind of a sci-fi story, but it' not.\\" So not only did I not want to read the book, I thought my teacher was a bit loony.  But, for my education's sake, I forced myelf to start reading it.  I had it finished 2 months ahead of when the class was scheduled to finish.  It is a very good and well-written book.  I enjoyed it a lot and it definitely keeps your interest, because you never know what will happen next.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D rocks, they rock so hard. I hope this review is under 1000 words.
B0000028PL|5.0|This is one of my top 10 favorite albums.  I´ve jammed to it over and over.  When I need to rage, it´s right up there with Death and Rage Against the Machine - but better.  These guys had more talent than they knew what to do with.  New bassist Doug Wimbish is incredible here, although I´ve been told the original bassist was the anchor of the band that held everything together.  Vernon Reid is off the hook as is Will C.  <br />Every song is fantastic and unique.  Even the strange poem/art piece \\"Hemp\\" is interesting.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Snoop Dogg's best album. Except for the doggfather, the last meal, and da game is to be sold, not to be told. The album gets very funny at times and snoop dogg is super funky. He really reminds me of Metallica. They both have the same beat and rap style. If you like snoop dogg, you have got to see star trek. Doggystyle shows what it's like to be a G Dogg. His lyrics remind me of guns n' roses and Usher.
B00006F2TV|5.0|This was just all around a great movie. The special effects were awesome and the acting was good. A must-have in my book.
079073804X|1.0|\\"The Exorcist\\" was the scariest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a bit. Now, I love to watch fun horror films, the kind that scare you but also give you quite a bit of entertainment, and even some humor. But, \\"The Exorcist\\" did no such thing. The film was way too scary to even entertain. All of the disgusting blood and the nonsensical devil spirit made the movie far too gross and horrific. Plus, the story didn't seem to be going anywhere. I admit I could be wrong. Maybe the story begins to get better. I only saw a little bit of it. Alas, the little bit I saw left me so frightened and disgusted that I didn't want to see anymore. For those of you who love scary movies, even if they aren't intellectually stimulating and entertaining, see this movie. But, for those of you who enjoy fun, suspenseful, intellectually stimulating and yet still horrific films, see something like \\"Cape Fear\\" instead.
B0000024RQ|5.0|I love good folk music, it is so simple and naked. Quite an obvious choice for the fellow folkie who likes Dylan. This cd is so awesome becase it goes from being serious as can be masters of war to being funny as can be with I shall be free. I shall be free is the funniest song I have ever heard. This whole album is great with the exception of girl from the north county and Bob Dylans blues. So if you say you have folk music but not freewhelling bob dylan then you aint got nothing!<BR>peace out to all my freak out friends!
B00005LC4B|4.0|Cape Fear is a very intriguing movie filled with suspense and terror. This movie is very realistic which gives it an eerie essence, where the original was not as relatable or frightening. Robert De Niro and Juliette Lewis really get into their part and their performences are wonderfully astounding. The whole movie was dark yet exceedingly interesting. The thing I didn't like about the movie was Nick Nolte's performence, which I found to be very boring and incomplete. But, all in all, I would definitly recommend this film to anyone who likes profound and suspensful Scorsese movies. GO RENT IT NOW!
B0000640VO|5.0|Its lovely to notice that there is still a director who tells a lovestory in a differnt way as usual and chooses a figure who is different too.Dreaming while living in her own world and always helpful towards other people Amelie falls in love. What follows is a &quot;game of love&quot; which is stamped by humour and fun dependent on situation. Amelie tries to support other people (without noticing it) to realize their dreams and to solve their problems. She also includes her own &quot;craze&quot; in a game of confusion  which shows the fear and the contemporary wish of a relationship with this person clearly.<BR>Its a magical movie which Jean-Pierre Jeunet brought onto the screen of our cinemas and now our TVs. He succeeded in shooting an unusual movie which is told with nice rides and adjustments of the camera, with much irony and joke, with much love and romantic, with a nicely told story and with beautiful ideas. The movie bewitches me every time I see it again! You must watch this!

0792837614|5.0|Natalie Wood plays a recent NYC immigrant from Puerto Rico who falls in love with Richard Beymer, a former gang member. Wood's brother, played by George Chakiris, and Beymer's best buddy, played by Russ Tamblyn, are current rival gang members. Despite pressure from both sides, the two young lovers plan to run away, but it is not to be.<br />The musical numbers staged on the city streets are eye-popping, and the songs are beautiful and singable. Wood and Beymer seem miscast and wooden at times, but the music is simply wonderful and has stood the test of time: \\"Tonight,\\" and \\"Maria\\" are well-known classics. The multi-talented Tamblyn is completely convincing as Riff, the leader of the Jets. Rita Moreno and Chakiris shine as immigrants who have adapated by joining the Sharks. This film certainly deserved its 10 Oscars for its outstanding script and musical numbers.
0553213105|5.0|Of all of Austen's works, this is her most polished and important accomplishment.  Pride and Prejudice masterfully blends excellent humor with a very strong social critique of many of the follies and vices of her times.  Within its pages, the reader will find characters that are loveable, and characters that he will love to hate. The ending, while typical of a romance, is brought to its conclusion through the effects of a very tightly spun plot. This novel surpasses the high bar set by Fanny Burney's Evelina,  and is a must read for any fan of Victorian literature, of any of fan of literature in general.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|It's hard to compete with the original Rod Taylor 'Time Machine' but this one comes very close. It's enjoyable from start to finish, with a great looking Time Machine,super special effects and an enjoyable plot.<BR>I would have preferred an ending somewhat similiar to the way the 1960 version ended (if you don't know I'm not going to spoil it - go watch it !) but I suppose the director didn't want to follow too close.
B00005LQ04|3.0|There's just something about this movie that causes you to focus:-<br />[a] On the footwear - especially Jessica Harper's towering and totterting moments in the rain at the Airport; and<br />[b] Alida Valli's 'sensible clogs' - they rival the Lotte Lenya mules in 'From Russia with Love'.<br />[c]  NOW about the hair - was the Oldman \\"Dracula\\"  inspired by Valli's hair???<br />Then there's the pristine dental work - - - one has to behold that too!<br />However, this little GEM of a Thriller [Slasher? What Exactly Is it? It IS one of the best examples of a Collector's Series, all one ever wished to know about \\"Suspiria\\" is here!] It probably went on to inspire the look of \\"Diva\\", \\"TiTus\\", \\"Miami Vice\\" {?} AND was probably inspired by \\"Vertigo\\" - so similar in visual concept .... a subtle homage?<br />It's a noisy, atmospheric and almost irritating little [?] work and still is very, very effective after 25 years? Oh yes, and will continue to amaze and somewhat confuse everybody.<br />Color choices are superior - especially the day-glo blood, and nothing quite surpasses that original first homicide, except maybe the barbed-wire sequence ...... Very quriky and odd and totally original - just think what director DARIO ARGENTO could do if unleashed in Hollywood!<br />Miss Harper [rarely seen today - currently in \\"Minority Report\\"] is perfect as the innocent abroad, the Great Valli suitably terrorises as the 'assistant' to Joan Bennett's quaint Madame Blanc ..... nasty work afoot along the lines of the original \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" complete with airborne drapes .... make sense? Not really, it's more of a totally visual [and sonic] experience. The dubbing IS dreadful, but somewhat appropriate, as if one has had just that one drink too many and the words seem to be slightly slurred and somewhat unintelligible.<br />Technically a very superior product - beautifully restored and the sound IS tremendous.<br />ALSO, quite superbly presented in the snap-case format - No fumbles, and there's absolutely no danger of damaging this collector's item .....<br />Highly recommended for the serious collector - a prize!fumbles, and there's absolutely no danger of damaging this collector's item .....<br />Highly recommended for the serious collector - a prize!
B00000JY1X|4.0|There's always a struggle for songwriters to figure out how to write a good love song.  So many do's, so many more don't's.  So much space to completely screw it up.  And the use of cliches is probably the greyest of all areas in the love song.  How do you avoid them?  How do you say it in a clever way that hints at cliche without really saying it?<BR>The Magnetic Fields have come up with the greatest way of handling these problems.  If you can't beat em, embrace em!  That's right, this is maudlin, cliche, sappy music.  With lines like &quot;Not for all the tea in china&quot; or the chorus &quot;I'm the luckiest guy / on the lower east side / cause I got wheels / and you wanna go for a ride.&quot;  The Magnetic Fields mastered the system by falling right into it.  Fully taking on songs about heart break, love of one who will not recipricate, love songs with cheesy country twangs with cheesier lyrics (&quot;well my hearts running round like a chicken with it's head cut off / all around the barn yard fallin' in and out of love / poor things blind as a bat / getting up falling down gettin up / who'd falling in love with a chicken with it's head cut off... whoa nelly!&quot;) and they do it masterfully.<BR>Their styles of music vary across the board.  Piano ballads, folk tunes, country rock, jangly 80's pop, even a track that sounds like a strange hybrid of Bo Diddley beats, country rock melody and Phil Spector's Ronnetes run through a meat grinder (&quot;I'm Sorry That I Love You.&quot;)<BR>The Magnetic Fields are what Belle and Sebastian would be with better senses of humor, less melodrama, and rather than being obsessed with 60's and 70's music they were obsessed with 80's music.  They've mastered the 80's melody, maintaining a good sense of humor without sacraficing any credibility in their lyrics (you really believe the lyrics).  They've got a They Might Be Giants feel, but will last longer without getting irritating (there are a few small exceptions here).<BR>The only real downside to the album is occasionally finding tracks that are a bit novelty and may wear off their appeal.  The overall length is barely a problem here, because there's just so many songs that are just so catchy.<BR>Enjoy.  These are the best love songs you'll hear for a while.
B00004XPP0|5.0|This movie has always been a must for me.  I have seen all three movies numerous times and I'll continue to watch them till my eyes hurt.  I have not purchashed the trilogy on VHS just yet because I'm anxiously waiting for it to be converted to DVD format.  When this milestone is releaseed on the scene all other movies\DVD's had better drop their release anchors before they become blown out of the water.(Just to put it lightly)
B0000683DH|5.0|Forget piddling arguments about which Trek movie is the best because ST2 transcends the Trek genre.  It is one of the best science fiction movies of the last two decades.  It can proudly occupy the short list which includes The Empire Strikes Back, Blade Runner, The Terminator. If T'Pau is like all of Vulcan in one package, then this Director's Edition of ST 2:  The Wrath of Khan is like all of Star Trek in one package.  It's the definitive Trek film and it has never looked or sounded better.  Great cast interviews, original trailer and even a wonderfully nerdy interview with two Trek authors.
B000002I2G|3.0|\\"The Soft Parade\\" remains the infamous Doors album, infamous because it is the only \\"weak\\" one in their body of work. To understand the weakness of \\"The Soft Parade,\\" you have to look at the time when it was made. In 1969 Jim Morrison was growing weary of his sex-symbol image and was more interested in writing and filmmaking. Therefore, it is important to note he didn't write as many of the songs in this album as he did in the previous ones and would in their final two classics, \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and \\"L.A. Woman.\\" Morrison's heart wasn't in this album and in fact, wasn't much into the rock icon thing that much, this album was released shortly after the notorious Miami incident where Morrison is said to have exposed himself at a concert that turned into a near-riot. The production of the album though, would have been exquisite had this been for another type of band. Violins are wonderful instruments, and violinist Nigel Kennedy recently released the wonderful \\"The Doors Concerto.\\" But here the orchestral arrangements don't seem appropriate, or comfortable. Notice that the Morrison-penned songs lack violins while all of Robby Krieger's (which take-up most of the album) do. The single, \\"Touch Me,\\" which sold almost as many copies as \\"Light My Fire,\\" is corny, no doubt about it, especially for the band that is given credit for breeding among other styles, goth rock. Yet, the song has it's emotional moments sometimes. \\"Do It\\" is repetitive and extemely weak while \\"Wishful Sinful\\" is an alright song, but unlike most other Doors classics, it is not timeless and feels aged. Not for the fans of \\"Strange Days\\" and \\"Not To Touch The Earth.\\" The best cut in the album is one of the Doors' most interesting, catchy songs, \\"Wild Child.\\" It is energetic with a tribal-beat feel to it, the slide guitar riff is one of the catchiest of all time and the lyrics are indeed, cool and cryptive (\\"remember when we were in Africa?\\"). It is one of the band's best songs and the one from this albumthat stands out. The title song works and doesn't. The first half sounds weird and doesn't have a pull, the final half does and has a great touch of dark atmosphere and lyrical creativity. After listening to the other albums, \\"The Soft Parade\\" sounds like a simple slip, which happens to every band at some point. Not EVERY album can be a masterpiece. Except for \\"Wild Child,\\" all the other songs are too soft, too restrained for The Doors, they would be great for Enrique Iglesias, but not for Jim Morrison. It is good to remember they followed this with the comeback album that featured \\"Roadhouse Blues.\\" The rest, as they say, is history.

1586212567|5.0|Robert doesn't give you any \\"get rich quick\\" schemes, this is a straight forward, easy to read book about changing your mind set in order to obtain wealth.  You cannot become a wealthy person without thinking like a wealthy person first.  This book is very similar to \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" because it makes you question your core beliefs about money and how to obtain it and how to stop having a \\"loser\\" or \\"chicken little\\" mentatlity.  A lot of books out there give you the details of what to do but do not discuss the personal psychology behind wealth-buiding.  I was introduced to Robert's books almost 3 years ago by my father at the beginning of my college career and have taken all the steps necessary to ensure the fact that when I graduate in may of 2003, I will not have to type up any resumes, go to any job fairs, or interview for a future career with XYZ corp. of America because I started a business, heavily invest in real estate with my business partners, and continue to learn about wealth buidling tactics.  If I can do this before I graduate from college, anyone can, you just have to change your mindset from a person who works for money to a person who lets money work for them.

0316666343|5.0|Fourteen year old Susie Salmon's short life is stolen from her when a man from her neighborhood rapes and murders her. After she dies Susie, while in heaven, watches all the people she loves on earth. She watches her younger sister Lindsey build walls around herself to numb the pain, and learn how to grow up without a sister. She watches her parents' marriage collapse and her father's desperate attempt to find Susie's killer. She watches her almost-boyfriend whom she shared her first kiss with get over losing his first love. She watches Ruth, a girl she barely knows, connect with her death and become obsessed with it. She watches her 4-year-old brother Buckley try to understand things he is far too young for. And she watches her killer get away with her murder with very little questioning. As the years pass by people forget about how little Susie was murdered, but no one ends up unaffected.<br />After being suggested this book by a friend, I quickly went to the nearest bookstore to buy it. I was not disappointed. The Lovely Bones is a new near perfect novel about heaven, love, family, and how people react to horrible situations. The simple style and writing of this novel manages to created an original story that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike.
B000002JPA|5.0|I was introduced to this band while I was serving in the Amry in Korea in 1992-1993.  Dream Theater is simply the premier progressive rock band on the planet, bar none.  From the slow, stirring ballads to the driving rock, this album is through and through fantastic.  The musicians show their versatility on every song.  They seem just as comfortable on Another Day and Surrounded as they do on Metropolis Pt.1  Two suggestions that I have for all prospective music lovers, if you don't have this cd, make it a priority to get it, or if you know somebody who appreciates a wonderful cd with talented muscians, this would make a terrific gift.
B000066NW0|5.0|I absolutely love this album - from the beginning to the end, it's full of powerful lyrics with a kick.  Some songs show Avril's ruthless and down-right bitchy side while others show her vulnerable side.  Her voice is a combination of several popular artists but she truly has a sound of her own.  It's an outstanding album!

I cannot beleive this album has escaped me for so long, I should have known it would have been this great... Songs like Blue Sunday, Queen of the Highway, and Indian Summer are proof this album stands alone.<br />I would recommend this album for anyone who wants to kick back for 39 minutes, my copy isn't new, it was simply a gift and my other albums were stolen when I moved some years ago... I recommend buying EVERY single doors album that ever was made.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I'd most like to reflect on &quot;I knew I loved you&quot;.  I did know I loved my husband before I even met him, we met over the internet, and after 9 months of chatting, met, and new it was destiny.  This song was played at our wedding, and brings tears to my eyes everytime I hear it.  This is a must have for fans of lovey dovey stuff :o)  When you are not feeling all mushy inside, and you're kinda angry about love, listen to Gunning Down Romance... but don't get to carried away with it.  I'll always remember how they started.. with Truly Madly Deeply.  *sigh*  Affirmation is a song to bring you an awakening of reality.. maybe you'll agree with him on a few things?
B00003CXI1|4.0|Chris Columbus did an excellent job putting this book onto the screen. One of my coworkers has 6 copies of this film because she is scared of not having a back up. My teenage sisters (13, 14 and 16) love it along with my 31 year old boyfriend and I (25 years old). The only annoying thing about the dvd is that whenever you want to see the extra scenes you have to go through a whole series of stuff. Very cool the first time but irritating to have to do it everytime. The casting was perfect. The actors really look like the characters from the book. The magic was also very well done and believable. I don't recommend this movie for children too young as my friend's 5 year old daughter was scared (although she loves the movie) other than that this is a must own movie.
0553213105|4.0|The \\"truth universally acknowledged\\" that begins Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of the best opening sentences in English literature; its irony, subtle and caustic, perfectly sets the tone for the novel, which is about the manners of courtship and the classist attitudes toward marriage in Regency England.  The message Austen is conveying is that the rules of the marriage game are, at least to the propriety-conscious gentry, more interesting than the romance that leads to marriage.<br />The novel's heroine is Elizabeth Bennet, the second, and the wittiest and liveliest, of five daughters in a middle class English family.  Her mother, a simple and silly creature whose greatest desire in life is that her dowry-deficient daughters should marry well, is ecstatic when she learns that a wealthy single young man named Mr. Bingley has moved into a nearby house; she imagines him a potential husband for one of her daughters.  Bingley turns out to be charming and friendly, but his friend, Mr. Darcy, also wealthy, single, and young, snobbishly appears to consider himself superior to the Bennets.<br />Jane, Elizabeth's older sister, falls in love with Bingley, but Darcy tries to discourage his friend from courting a girl of a social status lower than his.  Elizabeth and Darcy develop a strangely flirtatious relationship that is partly affectionate and partly adversarial, provoking the jealousy of Bingley's attention-starved sister, who is attracted to Darcy.  Elizabeth must also fend off the affections of her cousin, a clergyman named Mr. Collins who is amusingly persistent in his marriage proposals to her; fortunately, her rebuffs finally cause him to marry her less attractive friend instead.  Collins shamelessly panders to his patroness, the haughty, imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, who practically demands that Darcy (who happens to be her nephew) marry her diminutive daughter, and Elizabeth had better not get in the way.<br />A charming young soldier named Mr. Wickham, whose father was employed by Darcy's father and who became Darcy's father's ward after his own father's death, enters the story.  To Elizabeth he claims that Darcy is withholding money from him that is due him; Darcy responds that Wickham is a freeloader who is not entitled to any more money than he has already gotten.  Wickham risks damaging the Bennets' reputation when Elizabeth's youngest sister Lydia, who is as prattling and frivolous as her mother, impetuously decides to elope with him.<br />If the \\"pride\\" in the novel is Darcy's self-regard, the \\"prejudice\\" is Elizabeth's initial opinion of him as an insufferable snob, because by the end she learns that he is quite honorable and charitable after all.  He reveals to Elizabeth that he was raised by his parents to feel superior to the lower classes, but her willingness to stand up to him and his conceit has taught him modesty and humility and endeared her to him.  It is this transformation of character, similar to a gender role reversal of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" that distinguishes Austen's novel as a special achievement of 19th Century English literature.
B000003TA4|5.0|The first time that I ever heard Kurt Cobain sing \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was the first time that I saw the video on MTV back in 1991.  There was no skintight spandex, no shiny leather, no feathered hair, no expensive sports cars, no drooling scantily-clad women, etc.  Instead, there were three average guys in blue jeans and regular shirts rocking harder and better than any 1980's glam-rock band could ever hope to achieve!  Songs such as \\"Come as You Are\\", \\"Something in the Way\\" and \\"In Bloom\\" spoke to the average people a lot more than hearing & watching the typical egocentric hair-band paryting in a hotel room.<br />Too much of 1980's pop rock and glam-rock had become predictable and cliché.  People needed to hear something different and Nirvana was one of the groups that walked into the spotlight forever changing the sound and shape of rock-and-roll forever!  Once Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" hit the streets (along with albums by Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins and other alternative rock bands), 1980's pop rock and glam-rock died in what seemed a only matter of months.<br />Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" will forever be a powerful testament to rock's revolution against excess.  It's an album that will always be in my collection and one that I frequently listen to.<br />Thanks Kurt for bringing rock back to the people.
B000062XFG|4.0|The second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation was immediately troubled with the writers' strike in Hollywood, thus many of the episodes fall short of being the usual inspiring episodes fans have come to expect.  <br />What is most interesting and significant about this season is the introduction/departure of certain characters and the development of already familiar faces.  At the forefront, Gates McFadden was not invited to return for the second year (she'll be back) and thus Dr. Beverly Crusher was replaced with Dr. Katherine Pulaski played by the witty Diana Muldaur.  Curiously, Muldaur chose to be listed not as a regular star but as a special guest star.  Whoopi Goldberg joins the cast as the bartender Guinan in the newly shown Ten-Forward lounge of the Enterprise.  As for character development, the whole crew rallies behind Data in the episode \\"Measure of a Man\\", we finally get a permanent chief engineer with LaForge, and they have decided that Wesley is not a member of the senior staff and does not have the right to be in on all the staff meetings (as he did throughout the first season).<br />Some excellent stand out episodes are: Contagion, Q Who, Pen Pals, Peak Performance, Time Squared, The Emissary, and The Measure of a Man.  Some episodes that are still too painful to watch: The Outrageous Okona (the biggest stinker ST:TNG episode of all time!), The Royale (apparently they had a great idea but the budget was cut at the last minute), Shades of Gray, and Loud as a Whisper.<br />Although I am a die-hard fan of the Dr. Crusher character, I am saddened that the Dr. Pulaski character was never seen or heard from again.  We have no idea what ever happened to her.  After three (soon to be four) movies, three spinoff series, and lots of crossover episodes, there has never been a single mention of her.  So, if you like Pulaski, buy this DVD set, since it is likely to be the only time you will ever see or hear of the character.  And if Ms. Muldaur ever happensto read this: \\"Diana, despite all the criticisms of the Pulaski character, you did a great job.  Thanks for the year you gave us!\\"
B000002KKD|5.0|The first time that I was exposed to the B-52's was at a friend's party back in the late 1980's where he played this album.  The music had a totally infectious quality to it getting a number of people to start dancing wherever they were!  Shortly thereafter, I saw the video for &quot;Love Shack&quot; on MTV and I was totally hooked!  I went and bought this original &quot;B-52's&quot; album along with &quot;Cosmic Thing&quot; and couldn't stop playing them! I later found and got copies of all of their other albums, but this album I believe is one of their best with the songs: <br />The hypnotic &quot;Planet Claire&quot; with Fred singing &quot;Planet Claire has pink air, all the trees are red! No one ever dies there, no one has a head!&quot;<br />The anthem &quot;52 Girls&quot; with Cindy &amp; Kate singing &quot;O-o-o Kate, Kate and Cindy and Crystal and Candy, Mercedes and Joan, Betty and Brenda, Suzie and Anita and Phoebe and Jack Jackie-o! These are the girls of the USA! The principal girls of the USA!&quot;<br />The wild &quot;Dance this Mess Around&quot; with Cindy Wilson singing &quot;Why won't you dance with me? I'm not no limberger!&quot;<br />The totally infectious &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; with Fred singing &quot;Here comes a stingray, There goes a manta-ray! In walked a jelly fish! There goes a dog-fish, Chased by a cat-fish! In flew a sea robin! Watch out for that piranha! There goes a narwhal! HERE COMES A BIKINI WHALE!&quot;<br />The totally charged &quot;Lava&quot; with Kate &amp; Fred singing &quot;My love's mountin'! My love's eruptin' like a red hot volcano!&quot;<br />The sci-fi inspired &quot;There's a Moon in the Sky Called the Moon&quot; with Fred, Cindy &amp; Kate singing &quot;There's a moon in the sky<BR>It's called the moon! And everybody is there, including: Saturn, Mercury! Saturn, Venus! Saturn, Mars! Saturn, Jupiter! The Van Allen Belt!&quot;<br />The soulful &quot;Here Worship&quot; with Cindy singing &quot;Jerking motions won't revivehim, mouth to mouth resusitation! I just lay down beside him and idolize!&quot;<br />The very fun &quot;6060-842&quot; with Fred singing &quot;Tina went to the Lady's room, saw written on the wall, 'If you'd like a very nice time, just give this number a call!'&quot;<br />Also is the only cover ever recorded by the B-52's: &quot;Downtown&quot;.<br />Many thanks to Fred, Cindy, Kate, Keith and the late Ricky for the most upbeat &amp; fun music of all time!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Okay, okay, \\"Gettysburg\\" is released the same year that some blockbuster \\"Apollo 11\\" comes out and pretty much ousts the competition, but to leave this three plus hour epic totally left for naught at the Oscars is an extreme insult to everyone that took part in Ronald F. Maxwell's \\"Gettysburg\\".<br />Based from Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize-winning \\"The Killer Angels\\", \\"Gettysburg\\" brags an all-star (and heavily underrated) cast of Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, Jeff Daniels, Richard Jordan, Stephen Lang, and Sam Elliott. The film was written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell and scored by Randy Edelman. The film was actually more successful when it was put on television as a mini-series, but this incredible movie will be branded in my heart forever.<br />The story follows the main characters of Confederate generals Lee (Sheen), Longstreet (Berenger), and Union colonel Chamberlain (Daniels) as both their armies meet accidentally in a small town called Gettysburg in the heat of July, 1863. With effective supporting roles, Sam Elliott opens the story for us as cavalry general Buford, a hardened veteran who was the real hero of the first day, snubbed (ahem) from credit because the Union commander at the time did not favor cavalry. Stephen Lang plays Confederate general Pickett, one of the most famous (or infamous) generals ever to be known in American history. But, by far, the best role is that of fellow Confederate general Lewis Armistead, played (in his final role) by Richard Jordan. Armistead is a conflicted man as he must face his best friend on the opposite side of the battlefield.<br />\\"Gettysburg\\" wisely focuses more on the lives surrounding the battle than the battle itself, creating a heavy atmosphere. When there are battle scenes, they're more dramatized than anything else - focus again was supposed to be on the characters, not on the gore, so sometimes it seems a little fake. For we historical nitpickers, Sheen's Virginian accent is too heavy, and Longstreet'sbeard is horrible, but if you're looking for what could have easily been the best picture of 1993, buy this.<br />I believe their should have been four nominations: Best Actor (Daniels) who as Chamberlain, unquestionably gives the best performance of his career; Best Supporting Actor (Jordan), who would die of brain cancer before the film could premiere easily was given the most emotional role, and delivers incredibly. His monologues are performed beautifully, which leads to the next \\"snubbed\\", which is Adaptation Screenplay, for Maxwell. He surprisingly does a good deal of writing here, and of course, the last one, Best Picture...
6300216802|2.0|(this does not refer to the DVD director's edition edit)<BR>One of the most popular tv shows of it's time(and one of the most popular movie franchises) Star Trek: the movie is a winner. This slow-paced scifi flick maybe hard to watch if your one of those desparate viewers who won't wait forever something to happen(or boring as heck). Granted Star Trek is worth it down to the final climax, this 12 minutes of more footage is not needed! It is long as it is and it needs to be cut down to 2hrs or shorter!This movie does have a lot of pausing and a lot of scenes where they are \\"hoing and aweing\\" at the special effects for 7 mins or so. Some movies need longer cuts,but obviously Star Trek didn't.<BR>(2 1/2 stars actually)
0671027344|4.0|When i first started reading this book, i put the book down after two pages thinking \\"not another catcher in the rye rip-off\\". Sure i was not being fair, considering I still had the idea of MTV having a hand in its publication. But its a book ive enjoyed, its easy reading, and i felt light after reading it. It seems to be written in the Salinger style, in some ways it is, and in other it isnt. What i mean to say is, this book does have an identity of its own, rather than something thats borrowed. I highly recommend this book, especially to those that want an easy read and want to feel in someway or the other enlightened at the end of it

6304342160|5.0|Bound is a sexy, stylish and suspenseful modern visitation to the film noir genre that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. Right from the outset - where the letters of the film's name cast deep dark shadows like high-rise buildings - the viewer is inducted into a world where duplicity is the norm and where choices made result in prices being paid. And with over $2 million of Mob money at stake, the risk to life and limb is very high indeed.<br />Violet is a latter-day gangster's moll looking for a way out of 'the business'. Her chance comes when her boyfriend, Ceasar, brings home a fortune in cash to be sorted and collated before being passed on to the Chicago Mafia. She seduces the tough-talking ex-con who is renovating the next-door apartment (an impressively butch Gina Gershon) and together they scheme to relieve the Mob of the money. But when Ceasar doesn't react according to plan, suddenly there are dead bodies to deal with and events begin to spiral out of control. The women's trust in each other is stretched to breaking point as they are drawn into a deadly battle of wits. <br />Directors Larry and Andy Wachowski make judicious use of the conventions of film noir, such as extensive chiaroscuro, and some imaginative and uncomfortable extreme close-up shots. The clever cinematography is backed up by a tension-laden script and an excellent cast (particularly Joe Pantoliano as the increasingly frenzied Ceasar). Although Bound may take some viewers out of their comfort zone with its graphic lesbian sex scene and depiction of Mob torture tactics, it is a film that will reward its audience with a stylish and intelligent foray into the eternally murky confluence of good and evil.
0060955775|3.0|First let me say I am a huge fan of Paulo Coelho, but this book left me thinking, \\"How long does it take anyone to die?\\"
0553260111|5.0|After finishing this novel, I promptly ran out and picked up The Hades Factor. This was surprising for me, considering I don't normally care for spy novels - I've tried to read LeCarre, and, to my knowledge, have never actually managed to finish one. I guess that's some sort of bar as to whether the novel's any good or not.<br />The plot is simple at first, but grows more complicated as the twists and turns continue. The main character, who we later learn is named Jason Bourne (I hope that's no spoiler), washes up in the Mediterranean Sea and has no memory. He's not without his gifts, though. He is fully trained with weapons of all sorts and has military-like reflexes. He acts without thinking. The novel follows him closely as he wanders instinctively into the world and tries to find out who he is. At every stop, somebody is hunting him. He needs to find out why. (I hope I'm not saying too much in disclosing that he will eventually tied in with a network of assassins, who compete for supremacy.)<br />I found the novel worked on several levels for me. I particularly liked the moral dilemmas Mr. Bourne had to go through early in the novel, when he's just finding out who he is (or was). He has people he doesn't know firing at him - does he fire back? how does he know they're bad? He has to take a hostage to stay alive, but how far should he go? He doesn't know what he's done, what he's wanted for - is it worth killing an innocent bystander for? And, of course, what if, in his past life he actually had deserved to be killed? Could he risk bringing somebody into his world knowing this?<br />There are also issues with loyalty and personal loss. Even in the extreme distress of their situations, the characters are able to dig for deeper meaning, in people's eyes, and in their hearts. It isn't all guns and politics. I found the loyalties between some of the characters very touching, as when Marie St. Jacques stands by Jason because he saves her - even thought he'd previouslyheld a gun to her head.<br />Of course, there is the standard fair share of shooting and running and all-round suspense. At every turn, there's something forcing Jason to keep his wits about him and make impulse decisions. It all makes for a great read.<br />Matty J
0441009425|5.0|I've been reading and enjoying science fiction for at least 40 years.  For many years I've been very dissatisfied with the quality of new works, even those that win the major awards.<br />This novel turned out to be one of the most satisfying works of science fiction I have read in many years.  I couldn't wait to get home at night and pick it up again.  The combination of plot and amazing technology kept me enthralled.  I think this book will rank as a classic.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good, hard, science fiction.
B00004Z459|5.0|I never knew who Linkin Park was until I heard this album over my friend's house.  The first time I heard &quot;Papercut&quot; I was hooked.  Never in my life have I liked an entire cd, from the first to the very last song...then Linkin Park came along.  If you like Run DMC and Silverchair, then this is the album for you...
B00003CXI1|5.0|Between an excellent story, brilliant young actors, and awesome effects I enjoyed this movie fully!  The young lady who plays Hermoine is an absolute scene stealer, I'd never seen her before but she brought her character to life charmingly.  As an elementary teacher I hear my students and parents speak very enthusiastically about this film as well.  I know there is some religious controversy at times, which makes no sense because the movie is not about any religious aspect of Witchcraft, it is just a fun fantasy.
B000002U9L|5.0|I'm an avid David Bowie fan, and this is what introduced me to his work. When I first saw this movie, I was so taken with Bowie that I really wanted to get into the rest of his stuff. Oddly enough, this album is pretty different from the rest of Bowie's material, but that's because Bowie can do anything.<br />  I personally like the entire soundtrack and usually listen to it all the way through, but fan favorites include Magic Dance, As the World Falls Down, and Underground.<br />  This is a great way to get an introduction to David Bowie, it's probably his most &quot;normal&quot; album around. (Then again, most people love him because he is so different. That's why I think this album is a great intro to him) And if you just love the movie, it's all here to listen to over and over again.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|This is a GREAT album.  If you like the Original Van Halen, this one is essential.  You can hear the band letting it rip while having a great time in the studio.  Essential VH for fans.  The songwriting is there, the singing by Mr. Roth is there.  Mr. Van Halen lays it down yet again, and Mr. Anthony and the other Mr. Van Halen kick their usual keyster.  Turn this one up to 11!!!!!
B000067CPX|5.0|This group grew up. By the Way showcases this slow and organic evolution that originally started with John Frusciante's return to The Peppers on 1999's Californication.<br />This is some of the most harmonically dense music with some of the most inventive lyrical schemes I have ever heard out of these guys, period.  Anthony Keidis stretches his vocals out over an impressive range for this group.  John Frusciante's guitar parts are more about harmonic development than flashy pyrotechnics or tonic-based straight up grooves.  This piece also marks the first time Flea has ever recorded with a fretless bass on a Chili's song (I Could Die), and in this reviewer's opinion, it is his finest moment on the album.  Chad Smith's rock solid drumming found him diversifying with some electronic samples, always tastefully used.  Overall, the group interplay between the boys rivals that of 1991's BloodSugarSexMagic, only that the arrangements are far less jammy and much more structured.<br />Rick Rubin's production is the perfect compliment to this set of strong pop songs.  String and keyboard parts on some of the tracks work to accentuate the arrangements, rather than being there simply for the sake of being more.<br />This album has been called the Red Hot Chili Peppers' own Pet Sounds; a coming of age work from a band that many know as \\"those guys with socks on their ...\\"; however, to me it is a divine creative connection with a band of brothers that I predict will continue to enlighten and inspire and enrage and excite many more people to come.
B00003CXRM|3.0|Oh Brother Where Art Thou is one of those movies that gets better every time you see it. My first reaction to it was - `what the heck is this?' and then when I watched it again last night - for the fourth time - I found it very entertaining, strange, humorous and definitely mesmerizing in parts.<br />It's got everything, weirdness, action, adventure, strangeness and lots of very difficult performances. George Clooney leads the ensemble with appearances by Charles Durning and John Goodman. The films tells the story of three convicts from the 30's escaping their prison sentence but with the problem of finding a large amount of money hundreds miles away. Two of the convicts are not so bright and George, although seemingly a person who is well read, is somewhat out of tune with reality.<br />This film is definitely for the eclectic person who likes the unusual but entertaining strangeness that this movie is. Rent it once and then watch it twice.... the third time you'll probably buy it! (8-13-02)
0399103422|5.0|Mario Puzo's literary masterpiece The Godfather brings us into the lives of Don Vito Corleone, his offspring and his many \\"clients\\".  The Godfather is a saga of the Corleone crime family as it travels through war, peace and great posterity.<BR>     Vito Corleone, affectionately called the Godfather, is the Don, or leader of one of the most dangerous and powerful crime families in New York. He is a \\"reasonable\\" man who never hesitates to accept a favor from someone in turn for thier friendship. <BR>     Santino Corleone (Sonny) is the Godfather's eldest son.  Whenever there is a family crisis, he is the first to take charge when the Godfather can't. Sonny Corleone would be an excellent future Don, but his terrible temper and short patience plague him.  These faults are what lead to his tradgic downfall.<BR>     Fredo Corleone, the Godfather's second oldest son, is the ideal son.  He is loyal to his father, always willing to run an \\"errand\\" for him and never disagrees or embarasses him.  However, he lacks the ability to be aggressive and to take charge when the time is necessary.  This absence of animal instict makes him an unlikley candidate to inherit the Family business.<BR>     Michael Corleone is the Godfather's youngest son.  He is a recluse from all of the Family activity and refuses to ever get involved.  He goes against his father's wishes and joins the Marines, only to become a war hero.  But when his father is shot nearly to death in the street by a rival family, he willingly steps up and takes part in the bloody mob war that ensues.  When the Don passes away, he inherits the Corleone crime family business and eventually leads the process of becoming legitimate.  <BR>     Other characters include Connie Corleone, Vito Corleone's only daughter; Tom Hagen, the Don's Consigliori, or counselor; Peter Clemenza and Tessio, the Godfather's Caporegimes, or captains; Luca Brasi, the Don's bodyguard; and Johnny Fontane, a famous movie star/singer and loyal Godson toVito Corleone.<BR>     Mario Puzo's The Godfather is without a doubt the best depiction of the Mafia underworld in modern-day literature.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story of revenge, loyalty, and the powerful love that is family.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Kahn (Directors Cut) this is a fantastic DVD. Thanks to the genius that is Nicholas Meyer. He took the time to make a really great commentary and it is not your normal commentary either. He speaks of working with various types of actors, he speak with reverence at those who have established careers and he also gives praise to his technical wizards that made this film possible. Director Meyer is a very smart and obvious talented man.<br />The movie itself is my second favorite of all the Star Trek Movies. (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is my favorite.) And the best one for watching adventure. (The Voyage Home has the better story and a lot of humor - by the way Nicholas Meyer also is credited as one of the co-writers on that film too!)<br />Meyer will tell you himself that being a `story teller' is a big responsibility and he wanted to bring, reality, color, detail and a sense of humanity to this story. Also credit is due to Producer Harve Bennet for picking the story and getting the cast together to do this film. Most weren't interested in doing another due to the first film being not so critical success - although it was a big financial success.<br />Kahn was marooned on a planet back when the original series aired. He is back with a vengeance in this one. And he is mean. I won't tell you much more. Let's just say Kirk, Spock and McCoy have their hands full. There final battle scene is the best I have ever seen and the innate humor very real. This edition also contains many scenes that were not in the original.<br />Other extras on this DVD include interviews with the cast and crew and they are very specific, detailed and funny. There are even interviews that were done in 1982 when the movie was actually made. Also the screen menus are some of the best I have every seen. The only thing that is a little boring is the Star Trek Fan Writers - although noteworthy - not something I would have put on the disc.<br />This is a must for every sci-fi fan and a MUST for every Star Trek fan. This is two DVD's too! I hope they do this for the rest of the TEN films. Write me and let me know what you think!  (8-12-02)-fi fan and a MUST for every Star Trek fan. This is two DVD's too! I hope they do this for the rest of the TEN films. Write me and let me know what you think!  (8-12-02)
0062502182|4.0|When it comes to The Alchemist, Paulo has spun a web of characters, places,fantasies, and morals.<br />Side One is this... This story is a truly amusing piece of fiction that everyone, from kids to adults, can enjoy. The is a story of a little boy searching for his treasure.. End of Story.<br />Side Two is this... In general, when reading books, most authors tend to leave the reader to figure out the morals or lessons. Coelho, on the other hand, throws thoughts and morals on practically every page of the book and leave us, the readers, to think about them.<br />Hence in my opinion, all of Coelho's books are relatively short.<br />This leaves the reader with two choices, either to read the book for the sake of reading another story or fable without any moral, or indulging the reader with thoughts and morals embroidered within the little boy's adventures.<br />I must add this... One person might read this book and say, \\"But I already know this about life\\" or \\" tell me something I don't know\\" or \\"I know I should follow my dream\\" but do keep in mind this. This book targets a very different class of audience... it all depends on how one looks at life. If you look at life in a very pompous manner and never let your guard down even when you're all alone sitting on that couch reading a book, then this is not a book for you..<br />A clap for Coelho for the amount of research he's done.
B000063UR2|5.0|Legend (Special Edition) this is probably my favorite of all the Ridley Scott films. The imagery and now the wondrous score of the original European release of Jerry Goldsmith music is back. I have always had the original score on CD but had never seen it to the movie.<br />What I did find interesting is that they had interviews with all the cast and crew except one person. Tom Cruise. And, ironically enough no one mentioned him either. Now be it `star' attitude or the fact he would make himself available - either way this makes this DVD that much more special.<br />Ridley Scott during his commentary does mention Tom's talent and athletic abilities but he really does focus on Tim Curry (Darkness), Billy Barty (Troll), David Bennet (Gump) and Mia Sarrow (Lilly) and the technical aspects of making this movie.<br />The story is simple. Good verse Evil and Good triumphs. The visuals of the fairies and forest are incredible; one of the most beautiful things in the films is the Unicorns.<br />There are two versions of this film,  (two DVD) one with the less respectable music of Tangerine Dream (although good - not appropriate ion my opinion) and one, which is the European release with the Jerry Goldsmith score. This DVD is a must for the sci-fi and fantasy collector. I watched it several times. (8-13-02)
6305633177|5.0|Cliff Burton, possibly the all time greatest bassist in heavy metal history.  Here we get to see a tribute to the late bassist from the rest of Metallica, but the real treat here is seeing Cliff himself play a few bass solos.  I mean when you watch him play you will be in sheer awe, the man was inhuman!  While the video quality is questionable in some parts, the sound quality sure isn't, hearing the classic lineup go through \\"Fade to Black\\", \\"Seek & Destroy\\", and \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (my fave on here) is reason enough to buy this.  The DVD menu is worth mentioning too, we're treated to hearing \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" in the background.  All in all, this is a must if your an old time Metallica fan.
B000060P79|5.0|The songs on No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls are extremely clever, and oh-so true-to-life.  We can all relate to times when every day seemed like the &quot;worst day ever&quot; or when we wanted to scream &quot;i'm just a kid&quot; to our friends/family.  These songs combine heart w/fun.  the cd is really comforting, and in my opinion, simple plan laps blink 182 repeatedly.

B00005QG9J|5.0|some people say that incubus isn't as good as the past, but i beg to differ. this cd is another, words-can't-describe hit!  brandon gives his heart and soul again in singing the lyrics. the music is like no other.  without a doubt, buy it!
B000002KBH|3.0|You know you're in trouble as soon as &quot;Box of Rain&quot; kicks in - the song is a thin vapid construction.  Much of Side 2 doesn't quite add up to anything either - the songs seem like excuses for the band to play with Crosby-Stills-Nash harmonies (using studio technology and tricks).<br />But, a few tracks excel.  &quot;Sugar Magnolia&quot;, &quot;Candyman&quot;, and &quot;Truckin'&quot;, particularly.  Much of the rest of the album seems like a calculated bid to marry a bit more muscle in with the musical structure of &quot;Workingman's Dead&quot;.
078322608X|5.0|I was watching this movie on tv the other night and I was rather miffed that I caught it in the middle. I wasn't feeling to good (a little dizzy) so I was in no condition to watch the movie-which I later found in my collection-in its entirety.<br />Boy am I relieved that I watched all the way through. I hadn't seen it in a really long time and I was blown away by the its depth and twists. The acting of the Willis Pitt tandem is awe inspiring. If you are a fan of some of Pitt's other roles (Fight Club) then you will definitely see some cross-over with his anti-establishment attitude, though in this movie he is much farther off the deep end.<br />Not to ruin anything I'll just say that the plot, which will crush you in futility, is Bruce Willis traveling back in time to research a virus which has sent man kind under ground. His travels back in time aren't an exact science and as such His mind isn't exactly right. Couple that with trying to track down the insane Pitt it makes for a dizzy bit of acting. I think that this movie is a great mind-mess and should be watched again and again.
B00005221M|4.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite movies! I purchased this DVD (the new DTS version) before it was released quite a while ago  (at least 18+ months) but didn't watch it until yesterday. I had rented the VHS tape a few times before buying, so I decided to wait a while before seeing the film again.<br />I'm giving this DVD 4 stars instead of 5, but I want to strongly emphasize that I loved the movie and was not disappointed. The film is visually stunning and the music hauntingly beautiful (be sure to listen to the music during the end credits). I do have some minor criticisms though.<br />I won't retell the story because many reviewers have done that exceptionally well below (please see below). However, I will agree with those that stated a few things that could have been better.<br />There simply are no extra features. I know many DVDs are full of junk (substitute the word of your choice for \\"junk\\") these days that add to the cost but don't really contribute to the experience, but this DVD would benefit from something; anything actually, other than the sad list of characters (incomplete) that they provide. The main menu includes a sound/subtitle setup option, the aforementioned incomplete list of players, the required chapter index, and a \\"play movie\\" option. Nothing else is included. Nada. Zip. Nothing...<br />There is also the small matter of the missing scenes/lines (also discussed in detail below). I wanted to hear Hawkeye say to Duncan &quot;Someday you and I are going to have a serious disagreement.&quot;  Lines like these establish the interplay between characters, and though seemingly small, they define and broaden our view into relationships. The deletion of this scene and several others adds nothing to the movie, it only detracts, even if only a little. If you haven't seen the original, you'll never know it's gone. I myself couldn't remember what was different until I read it below, but then remembered how much I liked it the first time<br />All right,enough criticism. As I said, this is one of my favorite movies and will remain so. I would think about buying a new version if they actually released one with all the scenes restored, but if they don't, this one will do just fine. If you don't have this movie in your collection, I would recommend adding it. You will not be disappointed.
0783117523|4.0|Michael Cristofer couldn't have selected a more perfect actress to portray Gia Carangi than Angelina Jolie - Jolie's in-your-face attitude complements Carangi's bad-girl persona perfectly. Elizabeth Mitchell's portrayal of Linda is similarly excellent - the chemistry between the two women is phenomenal. Even apart from the casting, though, the movie is outstanding - aesthetically, it blows me away every time I see it (and only partly because Jolie is so beautiful.) The direction, the sound track, everything about this film is top-notch.<br />The story itself is touching, engaging, and heart-wrenching; watching the young Gia destroy her life with drugs, even choosing drugs over the love of her life, is a very emotional experience. I end up in tears every time I see the movie, and I enjoy it every time. Mercedes Ruehle does a great job as Gia's mom, expertly conveying the nuances of her own neuroses, and expressing her conflicting emotions regarding her troubled daughter.<br />I can't say enough good things about \\"Gia;\\" I really recommend it to Jolie fans, Carangi fans, or anyone who enjoys a good, tragic love story.

B00005JKED|3.0|This is a movie that wants to be a hard-hitting, powerful, blow-your-mind about cops kind of films, and it comes very close to that mark. Denzel Washington goes fairly deep into his dark side as he portrays Alonzo Harris, a dirty cop who meets out his own brand of street justice. Ethan Hawke, playing a naive rookie looking to be promoted, becomes more and more appalled as Harris' corruptions are revealed, and he is drawn into a web of deception and crime.<br />I suspect people will come down on different sides, in terms of how much they sympathize with or despise Washington's character - he dances on (and then stomps all over) a very thin line between making sure criminals are punished and making a mockery of the law. Where will you stand?
B000002PB2|5.0|I have been listening to Night Ranger since the early 80's and I have to say that they are still one of my favorites.

0066620996|5.0|Collins, in the tradition of the case study, names names and finds unique properties in the management of a number of Fortune 500 companies over a 30 year period. From a unique set of criteria he pursues, with no preconceived notions, what it takes to sustain profitability in a large public corporation which had previously been only mediocre. His findings are clear, well thought out and often surprising. In the realm of business books, this one is especially refreshing for a number of reasons. <br />This is a hardheaded skeptic's book. What makes it so special is that it does not assign magic to anyone, neither to himself as a writer or to any of the officers interviewed. Collins exposes his own learning process and allows the reader to understand the nuance in the emphasis of each of his concepts as he spells out the skeptical questions that his research team posed and the deliberation they went through.  Collins doesn't come off as a `guru' who has found some magic that only he and a handful of CEOs can see so much as a disciplined and curious leader of a research team struggling with difficult questions.  So not only do you understand what he means as he moves from `chaos to concept', you also see arguments against his initial reasoning. And since he is dedicated only those conclusions supported by facts rather than fitting random companies into some grand theory we see exactly what he sees and why. There is none of breathless exuberance that characterizes so much of business writing.<br />What is most refreshing and reassuring about this book's studies is that it puts us back in a sensible framework for understanding long term success without making a fetish of `leadership' or `innovation' or `excellence' or other buzzwords. This is the kind of book that demonstrates the sort of objectivity possible in business - it doesn't obfuscate or take the position that there is something mysterious out there. Rather he makes the complex comprehensible and when the answersare simple, they are presented simply. He constantly checks and compares the difference between unsustainable and sustainable profitability. All of Collins' concepts lend themselves to the sorts of metrics upon which rugged methodologies can be built. This is more than a book of management theory; it is a learning tool, which explains itself. I cannot remember the last book where the appendices were as interesting (and sometimes more interesting) than the main text. <br />It might be corny to say so, but I think his findings are self-rewarding. Working from the premises put forth, it makes sense for smaller companies and organizations some of which might not even be businesses at all. `Good to Great' offers solid lessons among which are that it doesn't take more energy to behave smartly but it does take nerve. Collins dared to work smartly and has created a great book.
0316666343|5.0|This book is really great.  My father died when I was 7 and this book, even after 14 years, has helped me to feel a great comfort as if he really is watching and seeing me.  It's just a great book and tears are easy to come at the end.
B00003CXS4|4.0|\\"Snatch\\" is a gangster/action film that is most certainly a cut above the rest of this genre's offerings that I have seen in a while. Director Guy Ritchie really pulled no punches with this twisted tale of a diamond, and the chaos that it causes. The film takes place in London, mostly, and is centered on several main characters. The most memorable being Brad Pitt as a bare-knuckle boxing piker (by far the best performance of the film and one of the best of his career I thought). But all of the performances in this film were great. The actors did a great job. Pretty much everything worked in this film, especially the script. The dialogue was fantastic. Some of the best I've seen in a while. The directing was also fantastic. Guy Ritchie has a bit of a unique approach to directing, but it really works in this film. The movie moves along at a somehwat rapid pace most of the time and it kept my interest pretty much the whole way through. <br />I would give a summary of the plot line, but it is rather complicated and I'm sure one of the other 200 people who reviewed this already have. I will, however, say that the plot is good and I liked it.<br />The dvd is a very nice package. You can watch the film in Widescreen or Fullscreen. It actually gives you the option! It would be nice if more dvds picked up on this great feature. The picture and audio are both acceptable and the menus are clean and nice. There are a bunch of extras spanning a 2 disc set and have the usual suspects. <br />If you're a fan of gangster films, action films, dark comedies or Guy Ritchie's style of directing, then I highly recommend this film. Very Entertaining. 4 stars!
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This CD is like no other, the lyrics spark the imagination, and the vocals are outstanding.  I love Enfilade, that song is great.  Well, I recommend  it to all of you.  The naysayers don't know what they're talking about.  Most importantly I am the hyena.
0380820846|4.0|This is the second book I've read in the &quot;Bridgerton Series&quot; and although I did not find it as wonderful as &quot;The Duke and I&quot;, I had so much fun reading this novel! It was so marvelous to explore and join with two endearing characters such as Penelope and Colin. Although the two of them getting together was a long time in coming, they certainly took us on a journey! The rapport that these two share lets us see their intelligence and sense of humor, while the attraction between them lets us see their beauty and sensuality. And in the surface, both Colin and Penelope seem to be all right with the world, but we find the secrets that they have kept show us who they really long to be. Julia Quinn did a wonderful way in making her characters come to life and leap out at you from the pages. I found Mrs. Featherington to be very superficial, but she certainly provided some comic relief. And Eloise gives out the impresssion of being tough, but still vulnerable. I truly enjoyed reading this book. Lady Whistledown's true identity was, despite my suspicion, truly a shock, but a delightful one. All in all, this is a story that will truly be enjoyed. I can't wait to see who manages to capture Eloise's heart!
B000001ESJ|5.0|2112 was definitely a step forward for the band, artistically and commercially, but AFTK was the first album in which everything held together perfectly. Neil Peart's lyrics reached the level he was hinting at in the previous 3 Rush albums, and on AFTK, his lyrics too all came together.<BR><BR>Rush even had their first hit with &quot;Closer To the Heart,&quot; but the best songs on this album are the opening title track, the 11-minute epic Xanadu (arguably their greatest song/epic), and the frightening &quot;Cygnus X-1.&quot; After this album, you want more Rush... well.. just pick up Hemispheres, Permanent Waves and Moving Pictures.
0064471837|5.0|I stumbled across this book at my local book store.  I was just looking for something new & interesting and i definately found it.  Sabriel is a great book for fantasy addicts such as myself.  The detail is great it seems as thought the characters and places are real.  Sabriel is very well written. There is suspence, action, suprises, and humor all the way through this book.  I couldn't stop reading. It is definately a page turner. I highly recommend Sabriel and also Lirael the sequel to Sabriel. Now all of my friends are asking me if they can borrow Sabriel.
B000002UB6|4.0|The Beatles were on their last legs during the recording of this. Tensions were very high, and it reflects in the music. The music is undeveloped, and most of these songs were probably in its conception stages, but they're good songs nonetheless. Not the strongest Beatles album, and some songs are tainted by Phil Spector's wall of sound techniques and overproduction. In my opinion, The Long And Winding Road didn't need the strings, and it took away the emotion out of the song, and instead turning it into saccharine. No wonder Paul quit once he heard the master tapes!<BR><BR>But &quot;Across The Universe&quot; is one of my all time favorite songs, and the rest of the songs are pretty good, so it's a 9 out of 10 for me.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I have seen this film four times and each viewing has been as enjoyable as the first.  It is a story that can delight and entertain even those who do not find ballroom dancing appealing.  Each character is well acted and developed.  It is a pity that Baz Luhrmann could not continue to tell such wonderful stories.  His Moulin Rouge is an eye and ear sore in comparison to this gem.
B000002J1S|5.0|On a very good day, it's in my Top 3 in my Favorite Records Of All Time. On a bad day, it's still in my Top 5. No doubt, Genesis at their creative prowess. So many musical ideas from its 5 very unique (er, at least at the time) members, especially Tony Banks and Steve Hackett. Peter Gabriel's lyrics are unlike anything ever written before or since. Not many other albums paint such a beautiful and such a frightening picture such as this one. There's not a single odd moment in the album, though some do say that the cacophonies of the Waiting Room are terrible and excessive. But it sets the tone for Rael's fear of what's happening next. <BR><BR>The storyline, to me, represents self-discovery and attaining your own nirvana (hence, the last song &lt;/i&gt;it, which has melodies which represent satisfaction and lyrics that represent fulfillment). At first it may seem coherent, and the production may seem outdated, but after a few listens, expect to be hooked!<BR><BR>Peter Gabriel's vocals are some of the best in his entire career. You feel what he's saying, from the isolation and anguish of &quot;In The Cage,&quot; the struggle of &quot;In The Rapids,&quot; and the fear of &quot;Fly On A Windshield.&quot; The group also wrote some exquisite mood music to go with Gabriel's lyrics and his very odd, yet eccentric story. Even the instrumental passages, like the perverse romance of &quot;Hairless Heart,&quot; the angelic &quot;Silent Sorrow In Empty Boats,&quot; and the ominous, windy &quot;Ravine.&quot;<BR><BR>After this album, Peter Gabriel left the band, and the abnd would subsequently transform their style into a radio-friendly style, which most of it isn't too bad. Just avoid Phil Collins' solo albums, and Mike &amp; The Mechanics. This album wasn't a great seller when it was released, and it's underrated. It's very sad that this album will probably never get the recognition it deserves, even when one talks about double-albums. Sure, there's The Wall, but this totally tops it. If you want some life-changing music, this album is for you.<BR><br />I never thought that an album Phil Collins played on would become an all-time favorite, due to my disliking of his saccharine solo career. But life is full of surprises.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Maybe.  Maybe not.  Whatever your reaction is, you have to admit this is one heck of an obnoxiously loud, FUN album!  As I'm typing this, &quot;Beautiful Girl&quot; is playing.  By the sound of it (and the rest of the songs), Mr. W.K. sounds like he's having the time of his life!  His message seems to be this:  Live life, and live it to the fullest!  The sheer exuberance and enthusiasm coming from this album is far more than enough for this pleased listener to play it again once it's over!  So what if it's heavily mired and influenced by 80's British metal (think Spinal Tap).  It may or may not be the most original material in years.  Then again, the important thing is to turn the volume up, push play on the CD player, kick back, and soak up the passion and energy coming from Mr. W.K. himself!  So what are you waiting for?  Do what I just said and PARTY HARD!  ;-)
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is much like the Pixies Surfer Rosa, in which Steve Albini's production (or recording) increases the impact of the material, what would Rape Me or Tourettes sound like with out the skinned face production?<BR>In Nevermind the guitars had a sort of glossy heavy metal sheen to them, that was part of its appeal, but when the first roar of a guitar (is it a guitar? it could be a musical vacum-cleaner) is heard, the album is downright heavy.<BR>While in Nevermind the drums carried the song, it was more in a top 40 way, in In Utero Albini's production has the trademark loud mid-rangey sound, and indeed they carry the song much better than ever in Nevermind, the un-comprimising sound of the drums really show how great a drumer David Grohl is, in Nevermind they were hidden, but here they're in full veiw without any sheen.<BR>With the non-production of In Utero the quiet parts are quieter and the loud parts are louder, and the effect heavys the album, combined with Kurt Cobain's suicide note lyrics the album is the defening roar of a tourtered mind.<BR>It really is the best Nirvana album avalible, unlike Neverminds candy sheen, Bleachs grunge heaviness, In Utero is the best of all worlds, amazing.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This was a movie that immediately jumped onto my favorites list. The love story that just mesmerized me. I watched it three times in a row after seeing it for the first time. Baz Luhrmanm is an incredible director. The camera work in this movie is amazing, the zoom in-and-out from the Eiffel Tower to the Moulin Rouge looks so cool. I love the fun feeling throughout the movie, of stolen songs, dancing in the clouds, fairies, the impromptu play, the dancing, singing, and the all around fun of the movie. Love stories are definitely not my favored genre, but this movie just changed all of my thoughts on movie plots. This movie includes wonderful song lyrics and vocals throughout the whole movie. You will love Ewan and Nicole's back-and-forth lyrics to each other. My favorite part is by far the part when Ewan is singing to her in the clouds. The surrealism and un-realistic quality of the scene offered me comedy and yet showed a serious love feeling to it. All of the characters in this movie are very comical, yet they can all have their bad sides. For instance, the strange yet wryly funny Duke, being able to go from completely calm, to furious, and a few seconds later back to calm. I can most definitely see why this was up for best picture. I think anybody could get to love this movie.
B00004RYZT|4.0|first off the band is great, but on the other hand there not enough extras on this. Still its a good dvd, and worth buying. the could put a few more extra in but it still a good thing to have if you like this band
B00003CWL6|5.0|The characters in this movie are just so multi-faced, creative, and have magnetic personalities. Lester just has an incredible look on life, and a great personality. The actors in this movie were obviously the creme-de-la-creme since they can cause such emotion in person like me. Annette Benning's character makes me have such rejection towards her and her personality. I feel so sorry for Lester in the movie, his wife couldn't care less about him, and she is also cheating on him. His daughter can't stand him and feels he is an idiot. Then he finally realizes that after all of his downhill happenings he actually feels good about himself, and then he dies. The montage after he was shot was the most moving scene for me in the movie. It went from his most fond memories of life, and the things most important to him while all the time showing the emotion and reaction of his friends and family towards his death. This movie deserved every applause or good review. It is by far my favorite movie of all time, for some reason I am always drawn to it when I feel like watching a DVD. The emotions and the dull life of this one man are just so entertaining, and never get tiring. I recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B0000009SI|5.0|This is by far one of the best albums that I own! This album is a masterpiece. I like every single song. It is one of those albums that you can put on and listen to the whole thing through. If you only buy one Zappa album, this is the one. Nine awesome tracks!
B0000524CY|5.0|I have seen this movie since I was a little kid, and it never fails to entertain me. My friends and family think I am so strange for saying that this is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. It actually seems like an extremely dark comedy in my opinion. The lines that Linda Blair has to say to the priest and others are soooooo funny. At the same time it can still be very moving. I was incredibly excited when I found they were releasing the re-release of the movie. This has been one of my favorite movies for years, and it will probably always remain that way. I do think that this movie is only geared for a few people, but if you don't like swearing, sexual inuendo, or desecration of the catholic religion don't watch this movie.
0609610570|5.0|This was an atypical management book - rather than focus on &quot;the idea that changes everything&quot; or &quot;the next revolution&quot;, it dives into the nuts and bolts of getting things done.  In today's economy, this is what we need.<br />The authors bring distinct viewpoints:  Larry Bossidy has the hardnosed viewpoints of a product of the GE management machine.  He lived through the GE execution culture and reapplied it at the Honeywell.  Ram Charan displays the broader view of a business school professor with extensive senior level consulting.<br />The book starts with a self evident description of why execution is needed.  It moves into the types of behaviors a leader should exhibit, and how they set up the framework for change.  It concludes with the three major processes an execution oriented leader should run: people, strategy and operations.<br />Yes - the book is generic, but it has to be to reach a broad audience.  The concept of focusing on all 3 areas:  people, strategy and operations is obvious, but important.  In the context of calling them processes - it becomes a discipline.  The general management focus and need for ongoing persistance is valuable to people of all levels.<br />There are some interesting ties to other management gurus.  Tom Peters - as outlandish as he may be - is also big on getting things done.  Deming's quality approach is ultimately about application.  Collins in Built to Last focuses on execution - the steady and stable leader trumps the charistmatic showpiece.  The ideas developed here have been building for some time.  Their time to come to the front of every executive's thought is now.<br />The book does have a few knocks:<BR>- If Bossidy built such a great culture for success at Honeywell, why did it fall apart immediately after his exit?<BR>- Is there any hard research behind this?  (With a former Harvard and Kellogg alum, you'd expect some)<BR>- There is much less focus on the customers than one would expect.<br />Despite these small misgivings, this is most definitely a useful read for any manager or aspiring leader.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It immediately became one of my favorites. This movie is not for everyone, I have watched it with many of my friends who ended up completely hating it, saying that it was pretentious, drawn-out, and made no sense. I think the people who gave bad reviews should try watching it again, and paying attention to the whole story, and learning the order of events. I can watch this movie over and over again, and I still wont be sick of it. If you don't settle for the normal movies that our put out every week I most definitely recommend this movie. If you plan on seeing this, pay close attention to the clues, they are more obvious then they seem. Overall I just have to say I love this movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers is the most authentic story I have ever read or viewed of a group of soldiers during the second world war or since.<BR>I have read many articles on the 101st Airborne Division and I must admit next to Saving Private Ryan this is the closest I have come to the actual truth about events that occurred about a unit that landed on D Day and then forward to the end of second world war.<BR>As a collector of war dramas I will make sure that this series that was produced will be the highlite of my dvd collection.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|If you've heard other heavy metal bands then you will soon find that Slipknot is completely different. Slipknot is Nu-Metal and their music is the most orignal of any other bands. The nine member band consists of 1 drummer, 1 bassist, 1 lead singer, 1 DJ, 1 mixer, 2 percussionists, and 2 guitarists. Their lyrics are powerful and depressing. The drummers are absolutely stunning. The most colorful and fast loops I have heard. And the re-released \\"Digi-Pak\\" version contains new songs!<br />Of course you must remember that you will think this is absolute ... if you listening to anything besides this genre. Especially if you like Classic Metal bands. This band is far better than other Nu-Metal bands like Korn.<br />My rating of the songs:<br />1)-742617000027 (1/10)<BR>2)-<SIC> (8/10)<BR>3)-Eyel ess (10/10)<BR>4)-Wait and Bleed (6/10)<BR>5)-Surfacing (10/10)<BR>6)-Spit it Out (8/10)<BR>7)-Tattered and Torn (4/10)<BR>8)-Me Inside (10/10)<BR>9)-Liberate (10/10)<BR>10)-Prosthetics (9/10)<BR>11)-No Life (9/10)<br />12)-Diluted (10/10)<BR>13)-Only One (10/10)<BR>14)-Scissors (10/10)<BR>15)-Get This (10/10)<BR>16)-Spit it Out (Hyper Version) (10/10)<BR>17)-Wait and Bleed (Terry Date Mix) (2/10)<BR>18)-Interloper (Demo Version) (7/10)<BR>19)-Despise (Demo Version) (8/10)<BR>20)-Surfacing (Live) (10/10)<BR>21)-Hidden Track 1 (1/10)<BR>22)-Hidden Track 2 (Eeyore) (10/10)<br />If you cannot deside between Iowa and Slipknot (Self-Titled), beleive me, Slipknot (Self-Titled) is far better! I suggest you buy Iowa after. If you can try to find a copy of Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat, their original debut album (extremely rare).
6305265666|5.0|If you like &quot;Time Period&quot; movies you'll love this one. After seeing it at the theatre, well I just had to have it for my collection. I loved the fantasy feel of the movie. Drew did a great job in my eyes!
B00005MAM2|4.0|[/quote] I did not find myself really caring too much about many of the characters.[quote]<br />Right on, that is my only gripe with the movie. Otherwise I really liked it.
B00005TT77|1.0|This shall be my first review that does not go far into detail, but I question whether it should ever need be done. Simply listening to thirty seconds of any of these horrible and disgraceful covers of these Beatles classics would turn anyone off to the soundtrack and anyone else who ever imagines covering a lovely Beatle song on their album or soundtrack. This soundtrack makes a mockery of The Beatles' work and is about the worst thing I've ever heard in my life (next to hip-hop). If it weren't for the only two at least moderately good covers on this soundtrack it would have gotten no stars from me. The only high points are \\"Two of Us\\" which is only mildly listenable because the artists are faithful to the original's style mostly throughout the song, but I was impressed at Sheryl Crow's version of \\"Mother Nature's Son\\". It turned out better than I had expected and did mostly keep to McCartney's formula for the beautiful original version from \\"The Beatles\\". This \\"Grandaddy's\\" version of \\"Revolution\\" must be one of the most terrible things I have ever heard! Nick Cave's version of \\"Let It Be\\" really lets you down and it's a wonder why they let him have an attempt at the Beatles classic. I don't know where to begin on Ben Fold's horrible version of \\"Golden Slumbers\\". And why is that this is here without \\"Carry That Weight\\" and \\"The End\\"!? All I can say is that this is THE MOST disappointing collection of covers, let alone just Beatles covers. I recommend buying the original Beatles recordings of these songs rather than getting this. At no cost should you get this in the place of any Beatles album (it could be Anthology 3 for all I care! Anything The Beatles ever did is better than this, even in its unfinished form) even if you're like me and own everything The Beatles produced in the studio. You will quite likely regret it if you buy this as many other buyers have. But don't take my word for it if this hasn't been convincing for you, just read many of the other reviews.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is one of the greatest CDs in the world. If you like rock dont hesistate to get this. You will not be disapointed. This album has awesome songs and you dont have to skip between any songs because they are all fantastic and have their own special meaning.<br />If you only like Smells Like Teen Spirit then oh well lol, but really all the songs are great.<br />GET IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UDB|5.0|This is without a doubt the most underrated Beatles album, and possibly the most underrated album all together. And the proof...Well... <br />Magical Mystery Tour, The Fool on the Hill, Your Mother Should Know, I Am the Walrus, Hello Goodbye, Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane, Baby You're a Rich Man and All You Need Is Love are all amazing songs, and most of them have made it on to Beatles anthology disks. And not only that, this album (I think) has gained more number 1s than the legendary Revolver. So figure it out for yourself. <br />The only real disappointing thing about this album is the ridiculous, ridiculous CD cover... Such a shame, really. I believe with a decent CD cover it could have been a classic.
B00005JLDW|2.0|This is one bummer of a movie.  Encased in dirt and grime, the characters are engaged in a last ditch effort to rid the world of thousands of fire-breathing dragons.  In fact, the entire world is gray, gloomy, and depressing--and filthy.  There's only so much of that I can take.<br />Just in case you thought that the movie would provide some quasi-believable backstory about dragons, forget it.  The writers either felt no reason to provide any logical basis for incredible idea that dragons are real, or they thought that the audience would be too dumb to need one.  Any movie that takes itself this seriously needs to provide at least some basis for suspending disbelief, and there ain't one here.<br />I can't give any spoilers in this review, so I'll do the best I can to review the movie without them.<br />Now lets suppose that you actually get beyond the point of the very silly explanation for how dragons might have survived for thousands of years in a very odd location, what next?  Poor acting (for the most part), one-dimensional characters, and a small amount of suspense.  The ending is flat.  It could have been great if it came after compelling battles against great odds, but it doesn't.  It just sits there.<br />There is one clever scene in which the last remaining humans begin crafting their own mythology based upon some popular culture icons, but that's the one high point in the entire film.<br />Now for the real question:  Are the dragons cool.  I suppose, for the little amount of time they are actually on screen (maybe 5 or 6 minutes at most).  But you don't go to a dragon movie to see hints of dragons, you go to get a good look at one.  That is the crowning let down.
6301978587|5.0|Even though i don't think much of Barbra as a person, and my reviews can be cruel to some people, I will always be honest and give credit where credit is do.This by far, next to \\"Funny Girl\\" is Barbra's best film.  Unlike the reveiwer i found ALL the songs beautiful and very important to the story. The music is loving, touching, inspiring and uplifing even if they make you cry.Mandy and Amy add so much to this film also and play great convincing rolls. My only problem with it is, why isn't this on DVD?  Other than that this film is a treasure and can be somewhat compaired to \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\" for original Jewish story.  You won't be disappointed.
B000059PR5|4.0|In the early 1980's, the United States and the Soviet Union were closer to the brink of nuclear war than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis (possibly even closer).  On one side, there was President Reagan referring to the USSR as the 'Evil Empire'.  On the other side, there was a steady succession of pre-Gorbachev Soviet Premiers (one seemed to die every several months) who stood fast to the hard line Communist party manifesto and constantly rattled their saber at the west.  During this period of the storm before the calm (brought about by Gorbachev's reforms), the world was on edge over the prospect of these two nations engaging in full-scale nuclear armageddon.  There were a number of television executives during this time who saw fit produce cautionary tales about the horrors of a nuclear war.  In Great Britain, a devastating made for TV film depicting horrific after effects of such a war called \\"Threads\\" was released (and shown in the states on TBS at considerable expense to the station's owner Ted Turner, because he thought it was too important not to be shown in the U.S.).  In the United States, two notable made-for-TV films were created dealing with this subject, \\"Special Bulletin\\" and \\"The Day After\\".  \\"The Day After\\" was the much more publicized of the two, owing to an all-star cast (Jason Robards and John Lithgow to name a few) and truly terrifying images of the actual attack.  As with any film that depicts very unsettling situations, \\"The Day After\\" generated its share of controversy.  Though, little of the controversy is remembered beyond the criticisms of the graphic nature of the attacks, and it does nothing to detract for chilling message it presents. <BR><BR>   The movie is set in Kansas City, Missouri; a place about as middle American as one get.  During the first half of the movie, we are introduced to a cross-section of KC's population, from a university hospital doctor (played by Robards) to a young Air Force Airmen and his family to a farm family preparing for the wedding of their oldest daughter.  There are many other characters and groups of characters introduced while, in the background, tension builds as frequent radio and television updates are received about a deteriorating military situation in East Germany that is rapidly bringing the United States and the Soviet Union to the nuclear brink.  This movie focuses little on the politicians who make the decision to go to war or the military men who fight the war.  It's about the innocent people who will have to live with the effects of these men's decisions.  The actual officers who execute the launches are depicted as impersonal machines of war, not human beings like the characters this movie highlights.  A radio speech by the president late in the movie betrays the faulty mindset of the politicians when he tries to give a rousing patriotic speech proclaiming victory over the evil aggressors while the people who listen are trying simply to survive and not fall victim to radiation sickness. <BR><BR>   The true climax of this movie occurs about midway through the film.  Reports are filtering of limited nuclear engagements in Europe which eventually lead to the full scale launch of all nuclear missiles.  The frightening scenes of the missiles taking off being viewed from a next door farm, the university hospital, and a football stadium are indescribable in the sense of panic they create.  Our missiles have been launched and will take 30 minutes to reach Russia, but so will theirs!  People try to find shelter.  They try to evacuate.  Yet, the question is posed, \\"where does one go from Kansas City?\\".  This is supposed to be the middle of nowhere, but with missile silos being placed any and everywhere across the country, no place is safe from attack.  Next, the horrifying images of the attacks beginning are easily seared into one's memory.  See the images of people vaporizing, fires engulfing everything, and the signature mushroom clouds of a nuclear detonation are not soon forgotten.  After the attack is over, \\"The Day After\\" engages in a lengthy denouement that deals with the unlucky people who managed to survive the war.  Radiation sickness impacts almost everyone, but not as much as the complete and total breakdown of infrastructure and society in general.  The horrors of the 'new world' are of the type that one should not be anxious to experience.  There is a note at the very end that claims that the events depicted in this movie are likely less severe than what really would occur in the event of an actual nuclear attack.  Given what IS depicted here, that is an absolutely horrifying thought. <BR><BR>   The only real criticisms for the \\"The Day After\\" center around two points.  First, there really are too many characters introduced.  Some barely even register because there isn't enough time to develop them.  Second, the denouement is a bit lengthy.  The message of how horrible the after effects of this nuclear war are could probably have been trimmed down to half the time without losing any of its impact.  Still, these minor gripes do not take anything away from the overall powerful message of this movie.  If more world leaders were forced to watch \\"The Day After\\" (and several of its companion films), the likelihood of nuclear war could drop significantly.
6304140711|5.0|This movie was AwEsOmE!!! Mark Wahlberg and Reese Witherspoon were VERY convincing as actors and the plot was GREAT! The movie was also very good, because it wasn't like Scream or Halloween...., because it had a good plot for a different type of story not just blood and guts. But it was still PLENTY scary enough for a horror movie!
037571412X|2.0|It's time for Philip Roth to grow up.  He's what?  70?  The guy has made a career out of his puerile obsession with sex, but his routine is tired.  Very tired.  Once again, he's dealing with his own prepubescent sexual insecurities, this time through the main character in The Dying Animal.  And what's this lifelong fixation on a woman's breasts?  Did Roth's mother refuse to breast feed him when he was a child?  Well, get over it!      <br />Sure, he can tell a story and is very clever, witty, comical, etc.  And yes, I'm sure there's a parable in the sad story of an aging Professor sleeping with a new student each year.  But the idea of someone devoting his life to the pursuit of casual sex just doesn't fly.  Not when the Lothario (Philip Roth in disguise) is 60 or 70!  What, are his hormones still out of control?  It like Mr. Chips meets Hugh Hefner.  Roth has created a caricature that just isn't believable.  It's too bad, since the premise of the story was TITillating (I hope Roth appreciates my anatomical pun) and had some promise.  But then he lapsed into his confusing philosophical tirades and misogynistic babblings.  Roth quickly lost my interest.  <br />Roth tries to humanize David Kepesh by dwelling on the protagonist's other obsession, which is playing the piano and listening to classical music.  But Kepesh fondles himself while listening to Beethoven, thereby blaspheming another form of beauty. <br />Roth has been trading off his Jewish angst for his entire literary career.  He's a one trick pony.  Let's see some creativity, some breadth.  Stop hitting us over the head with this Freudian obsession with sex and bodily functions.  Roth should get out of the gutter for a change.  And finally, his literary style in The Dying Animal of omitting dialogue and turning the whole story into an extended essay was cumbersome.  Luckily, the story was only 160 pages.  The Dying Animal is really The Dead Animal.

It took a few spins, but after several listenings this is one of the best CDs of the past 10 years (along with Ian Hunter's \\"Rant\\" and Kasey Chamber's two CDs).

B000002LMK|4.0|You have to admit that \\"Ragged Glory\\" has stood the test of time well, like a wall of sound wrapped in stainless steel. This recording exhibits that take-no-prisoners energy and brimstone Neil Young and Crazy Horse generated in their finer moments. Mr. Young has tried his hand at various genres of rock, but this set of flat-out, hard-core rock and roll numbers shows how great he can when he delivers a focused rant.<br /><br />It sounds best, in my opinion, played at high-volume through vintage stereo gear and speakers.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Lets start out by saying that I have played most of the Resident evil game series by capcom...and I ensure you this movie gave the the same..If not worst of a scare than staying up to midnight with the lights off playing..  This movie was well planned out and was worth the long unexpected wait.. The acting was very great, the only reason I give it a four because the ending was a little week.. I liked how the upcoming sequal was hinted at.. I will definatly be looking forward to the next episode of many in the Resident Evil series..
B00005JKNC|3.0|\\"The Majestic\\" is a piece of cinematic nostalgia that is unfortunately weighed down by a simplistic, heavy-handed moralism. While enjoyable, it lacks the originality and inspiration necessary to make it truly engaging.<br />Set in the early 1950s, the movie straddles two starkly contrasting worlds: Hollywood, populated by shallow people motivated only by self interest; and small-town America, represented by the fictional California coastal community of Lawson, home to hard-working, dedicated people who will sacrifice all for principle. Casting an ominous shadow across these two divergent landscapes is the dark cloud of anti-Communism, represented by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and personified by the Committee's Majority Counsel Elvin Clyde (Bob Balaban) -- bespectacled, humorless, single-minded, and stereotypically one dimensional.<br />The film's protagonist, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey), is a rising screenplay writer who quietly suffers formulaic rewrites of his scripts by unimaginative studio executives. When scrutiny by HUAC for a youthful indiscretion leaves him black-listed, he flees the shallows of Hollywood in a bout of drunken frustration, seeking solace up the California coast. A car accident along the way strips him of his memory and lands him in the open arms of Lawson, where he is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a war hero missing in battle and presumed dead. The town celebrates his supposed return, reinvigorated with hope after years of loss during World War II. But when Peter's memory eventually returns, he faces not only the town's rejection but also the unrelenting pursuit of Elvin Clyde. Ultimately he must face HUAC, and in response he must choose either the way of Hollywood or the way of Lawson.<br />The film features a solid cast, including Carrey in another sound, non-comedic performance. Nonetheless, the story requires an ongoing suspension of disbelief in order to succeed. How could so many people who knew Luke intimately -- his father (Martin Landau), his fianc&eacute;e (Laurie Holden), and numerous life-long friends and neighbors -- be willing to embrace a total stranger based on nothing more than a physical resemblance? The weightiness of such a proposition has a natural, downward pull that the film cannot quite overcome.<br />But this is not the film's greatest weakness: instead, it is when the film attempts to stir deep emotions that it bottoms out in a shallowness that betrays its origins in a Hollywood as banal as the one it critiques:<br />When Peter reads the last letter home from the real Luke, the words of that doomed soldier to his distant fianc&eacute;e are intended to evoke the sadness of impending loss. But to anyone who has watched the magnificent Ken Burns documentary on the Civil War, the circumstances and sentiments of the letter are immediately recognizable as a thought-for-thought (and in some places, word-for-word) plagiarism of the heart-rending letter penned by Union soldier Sullivan Ballou.<br />When finally called before a special session of HUAC (inexplicably broadcast live on both television and radio), Peter's speech is clearly meant to produce the patriotic, lump-in-the-throat reaction many have to Jimmy Stewart in \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\". But instead of stirring patriotism, it is filled with simplistic platitudes. Instead of conviction, it sounds contrived. It is small-town America through the distorted lens of Hollywood, and it just doesn't work very well.<br />Good performances by a high-profile cast and cinematography that paints a pleasant nostalgia make \\"The Majestic\\" an enjoyable watch. But its lack of creativity and its clunky attempt to wed small-town patriotism to to left-leaning Hollywood politics result in only a so-so film overall.s father (Martin Landau), his fiancée (Laurie Holden), and numerous life-long friends and neighbors -- be willing to embrace a total stranger based on nothing more than a physical resemblance?

But its lack of creativity and its clunky attempt to wed small-town patriotism to to left-leaning Hollywood politics result in only a so-so film overall.

B00005JKNC|3.0|\\"The Majestic\\" is a piece of cinematic nostalgia that is unfortunately weighed down by a simplistic, heavy-handed moralism. While enjoyable, it lacks the originality and inspiration necessary to make it truly engaging.<br />Set in the early 1950s, the movie straddles two starkly contrasting worlds: Hollywood, populated by shallow people motivated only by self interest; and small-town America, represented by the fictional California coastal community of Lawson, home to hard-working, dedicated people who will sacrifice all for principle. Casting an ominous shadow across these two divergent landscapes is the dark cloud of anti-Communism, represented by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and personified by the Committee's Majority Counsel Elvin Clyde (Bob Balaban) -- bespectacled, humorless, single-minded, and stereotypically one dimensional.<br />The film's protagonist, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey), is a rising screenplay writer who quietly suffers formulaic rewrites of his scripts by unimaginative studio executives. When scrutiny by HUAC for a youthful indiscretion leaves him black-listed, he flees the shallows of Hollywood in a bout of drunken frustration, seeking solace up the California coast. A car accident along the way strips him of his memory and lands him in the open arms of Lawson, where he is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a war hero missing in battle and presumed dead. The town celebrates his supposed return, reinvigorated with hope after years of loss during World War II. But when Peter's memory eventually returns, he faces not only the town's rejection but also the unrelenting pursuit of Elvin Clyde. Ultimately he must face HUAC, and in response he must choose either the way of Hollywood or the way of Lawson.<br />The film features a solid cast, including Carrey in another sound, non-comedic performance. Nonetheless, the story requires an ongoing suspension of disbelief in order to succeed. How could so many people who knew Luke intimately -- his father (Martin Landau), his fiancée (Laurie Holden), and numerous life-long friends and neighbors -- be willing to embrace a total stranger based on nothing more than a physical resemblance? The weightiness of such a proposition has a natural, downward pull that the film cannot quite overcome.<br />But this is not the film's greatest weakness: instead, it is when the film attempts to stir deep emotions that it bottoms out in a shallowness that betrays its origins in a Hollywood as banal as the one it critiques:<br />When Peter reads the last letter home from the real Luke, the words of that doomed soldier to his distant fiancée are intended to evoke the sadness of impending loss. But to anyone who has watched the magnificent Ken Burns documentary on the Civil War, the circumstances and sentiments of the letter are immediately recognizable as a thought-for-thought (and in some places, word-for-word) plagiarism of the heart-rending letter penned by Union soldier Sullivan Ballou.<br />When finally called before a special session of HUAC (inexplicably broadcast live on both television and radio), Peter's speech is clearly meant to produce the patriotic, lump-in-the-throat reaction many have to Jimmy Stewart in \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\". But instead of stirring patriotism, it is filled with simplistic platitudes. Instead of conviction, it sounds contrived. It is small-town America through the distorted lens of Hollywood, and it just doesn't work very well.<br />Good performances by a high-profile cast and cinematography that paints a pleasant nostalgia make \\"The Majestic\\" an enjoyable watch. But its lack of creativity and its clunky attempt to wed small-town patriotism to to left-leaning Hollywood politics result in only a so-so film overall.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Zombies and guns. Trapped. Zombies and guns. Running. Zombies and guns... It may sound like B-grade, popcorn, adolescent male fodder, but Resident Evil is actually a well-crafted movie of the survival-horror genre. Eschewing gore in favor of imagination, it skimps on the on-screen bloodbath, and instead plays a guessing game that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.<br />The scenario is that in the ultra secret military lab of the Umbrella Corporation, an extremely volatile virus has been set loose. The alarm is triggered, and the Red Queen, an artificial intelligence system, quarantines \\"the hive\\" to prevent the virus from reaching Raccoon City, trapping the workers in the process.<br />In an effort to save the survivors and salvage the research, a team of commandoes is sent in to reboot the Red Queen, before she seals the Hive permanently. A simple objective, but one immediately complicated by the discovery of our protagonist, Alice, a young woman suffering from amnesia. She has no memory, but the Team Lead recognizes her as an employee of the Umbrella Corporation, so she is taken into the hive with them.<br />What she finds there makes her doubt that she wants her memory back.<br />It may sound like overdone tripe, but Resident Evil (RE) takes some of the old horror cliches and makes them new again. Alice's memory loss is handled with intelligence, and enough mystery to keep the viewer guessing. The gore is minimal, as the film culls its scares from sound cues and implication rather than onscreen blood. Unlike so many other horror movies, it doesn't have gaping holes in it's plot (though there are a couple of lapses in continuity). Instead it cleverly weaves it's elements, slowly revealing how everything came to pass as it heads towards it climax. The coup de grace though, is the action. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez put the \\"grrr!\\" in \\"girl.\\" Wallflowers won't survive in the Hive, and these two ladies are intent on living. When the ammo's gone, they resort to hand to hand combat, taking a chunk out of their adversaries.<br />I won't recommend RE to those who are faint of heart, or abhor lots of shooting, screaming, and scares. But for those that love a good action movie, pop a bag of popcorn, and make yourself comfy on the couch. You're in for a hell of a thrill ride. And when the movie's done, check out the special features. The 2-disc Collector's Edition coming later this year will have the lion's share, but the Special Edition is no slouch. There are several \\"Making of\\" featurettes, a music video by Slipnot, and a commentary track featuring the principal actors and the director. Definitely worth your dollar.hey resort to hand to hand combat, taking a chunk out of their adversaries.<br />I won't recommend RE to those who are faint of heart, or abhor lots of shooting, screaming, and scares.

B0000683DH|4.0|_Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_ is my favorite _Star Trek_ film.  Only a few episodes of _TOS_ and _TNG_ equal it, and nothing in the franchise has managed to surpass it.  Regrettably, the emotional power of the film's climax has been dampened and cheapened by numerous sequels.<br />This two-disc DVD edition finally gives _Star Trek II_ the royal treatment fans have clamored for.  For my part, I wish the theatrical cut of this film had been included alongside the new &quot;director's cut.&quot;  The extra scenes, totaling about four minutes in length, are mostly bits of unnecessary exposition, and they merely bog down the story at crucial moments.<br />Audio and textual commentaries provide an encyclopedic overview of the film's creation.  Because of producer Harve Bennett's incessant penny pinching (none of which is visible onscreen), the behind-the-scenes anecdotes are much more interesting than one might expect.<br />If only the series had ended here.

B00005BCOK|4.0|Yul Brynner is absolutely brilliant in this movie as a robot gone berserk.His character is believable,and down right scary.I think that other actors could have also played this part well,such as Clint Eastwood,but none could have pulled it off like Yul did.As far as the movie itself goes,it's definitely not the greatest sci-fi movie you will ever see,and yes there are some inconsistencys,but it is worth seeing,if only for Brynner's performance.Some of the stunt work in this movie is very good,such as the part were Brynner's character is set on fire.If you watch this closely,you will see that this is one incredible stunt.
B000069HKH|5.0|&quot;This too shall pass, this too shall pass, I'm gonna pray,&quot; from the CD's opener &quot;Lonesome Day&quot; has Bruce Springsteen assembled with the old E Streeters in dare I say it, the band's best effort yet.  I may be hurling a beanbag at a line of milk bottles in the dark, like a rundown Asbury Park abandoned midway booth, but when the newness of the CD wears off I still see it being right up there with &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town,&quot; and &quot;Born to Run&quot; as the best pure music the Boss and the gang has produced.<br />The collections of songs inspired by post 9/11 events hits just the right chord of consolation, grieving, and searching for hope without being exploitative.  I couldn't think of another artist that could pull this off.  But the E Street's mix of blues turning into gospel has a restorative effect.  Every song has its place.  The cohesiveness could be chalked up to Bruce having all the songs pre-written before going into the studio with super producer Brendan O'Brien (Pearl Jam) and only running through 3-4 takes per song before recording.<br />I'm listening to it now and its all there.  The pop catchiness of Born in the USA, the folk of Nebraska, even the early summer time bravado rock of Thunder Road with &quot;Mary's Place.&quot;  Mary is grown up now, no longer dancing like a vision across the porch as the radio plays.  Instead she has a place of her own and the old band has made it over, the &quot;singers calling up daylight, and waitin' for that shout from the crowd.&quot;<br />Though there are elements of all the stages of Springsteen and the E Street's career, the 8 year hiatus from 1984's &quot;Born in the USA&quot; has worked wonders on the freshness and creativity in this collection of songs.  Out of the dust and ash, they have created something entirely new and oddly familiar.  &quot;Empty Sky&quot; comes from a view from Springsteen's New Jersey ranch of where the World Trade centers once stood.  &quot;Paradise&quot; has this weird mix of folk in a minor key and speaks of spirits in an empty paradise and as a lead-in and fade-out there is this electronic throbbing.  As if a heart is hooked up to a monitor, or a control tower is sending out pulses for a plane that is no longer there, an eerie mix of timelorn country and folk and modern world electronica technology.<br />This work by Bruce, his wife Patti Scialfa, the big man Clarence Clemons, Conan drummer Max Weinberg, and the guitar barrage of Nils Lofgren and Stevie Van Zandt is all that and a bag of Coney Island chips.  It's the best that has come out in 2002 and as a response to the events of 9/11 is honest and true calling for a rising of hope and not a rising of anger.<br />&quot;Sky of blackness and sorrow, sky of longing and emptiness, sky of fullness, sky of blessed life (a dream of life)&quot; ---The Rising&quot; has this weird mix of folk in a minor key and speaks of spirits in an empty paradise and as a lead-in and fade-out there is this electronic throbbing.

I can't believe Clive Barker actully said this was a scary movie, The special effects were cheesy, i bought the movie for 7.00 at Block Busters, it's so bad, i almost went to get a refund for the money.  Trust me if you don't  want a Big Disappointment, then don't buy this film.
B00000JNNY|5.0|This here is another collection of Marvin Gaye's work coming from the Motown vaults.  As we all know, Marvin has many classics under his belt and he serenades the listeners while working his groove.  The history speaks for itself.  And if that isn't enough for the average person, or someone that has all of Marvin's albums and does not want to buy another greatest hits collection, there is an unreleased track included that is entitled &quot;Where are we going?&quot;. Once again, it shows him pouring more emotion than the average singer out these days.  So in conclusion, I say this should be another addition to your Marvin Gaye collection.  As the title of his 1995 box set states, he is &quot;The Master&quot; indeed. Rest in Peace MPG. We'll remember you&gt;

B0000025F7|5.0|'Off The Wall' came out when i was 9 years of age. At that time all I knew about was the Jacksons.  Since Michael's first solo albums came out when I was 2 and 3 years of age this was my first true introduction into the man who would become the greatest entertainer ever! What Michael and Quincy did was not reinvent history but dared to take the elements of the period of disco and refine them in classics like &quot;Don't Stop Til You Get Enough' to &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot;. They layed the ground work for the brilliance to come in &quot;Thriller&quot; but it's &quot;OTW&quot; which has my first love as my favorite Michael album.
0792833201|5.0|A classic horror show about things that go bump in the night, Poltergeist promises to scare you: and it does!  When Poltergeist first begins, it seems as though it will just be another spooky movie.  However, once the first half concludes, the movie shows you one scare after another.  The swimming pool scene may make you jump out of your skin!  (Literally!)  Craig T. Nelson is just fine as the concerned father and JoBeth Williams is stunning as the intrigued mother.  However, it is Zelda Rubenstein who steals the show as the zany medium.  As an added plus, the phenomenal music sets the perfect mood for the film and the movie ends leaving you feeling very unsettled, just as a good horror movie should.  So if you are looking for a well-written, stylish ghost story, Poltergeist is just that.  But there is plenty of gore, too.  Rent it tonight and  enjoy!!!
B0000025RI|5.0|When 'Thriller' was first released December 1982 I was 13 years old. It was a continuation of the wonderful magic of solo Michael that I could enjoy and remember from 'Off The Wall'. This album is excellent in that it is the greatest pop album of all time and is timeless in the classics here. From 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It' to 'She's Out of My Life' Michael was on a roll. This album got me through my highschool years since his next release 'Bad' didn't come out til 2 months after I finished highschool in 1987. It's the album that everybody you know owns and I have bought it several times over the years when various copies got worn out by my constant playing of it. Truly this was the album that earned Michael being KING OF POP!

B00005JKQZ|5.0|Ron Howard (Splash, Cocoon, Backdraft, Apollo 13) has done excellent work as a director for which he has gotten little credit over the years.  With this film comes a best director Oscar and a best picture Oscar and finally the recognition he deserves.  Howard has always been good at presenting human stories, be they comedy or drama.  He has a intuitive understanding of character motivation and is excellent at making his characters elicit strong emotions in the viewer.  This is particularly true in this film.<br />The story is based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who suffered from schizophrenia.  The film gives us a unique first person perspective of the disease, drawing us into his world and allowing us to see what Nash sees.  Howard's presentation is brilliant.  At first Nash is presented as a bit eccentric, but lucid.  As we experience his world, reality and illusion are so perfectly intertwined that we are not sure where the world ends and the mind begins.  By fooling the audience Howard makes the subtle point that to the schizophrenic it all seems real.  In attempting to evaluate Nash's world we get a distant understanding of the confusion that results when a rational person attempts to cope with a world that is part real and part hallucination.<br />While this is a biopic, it is more fiction than fact.  A great deal of dramatic license is taken since Nash freely admits that he has little recollection of the years when he suffered from the disease.  The powerful speech at the end of the film where he thanks his wife after receiving his Nobel Prize is pure Hollywood.  Included in the DVD is footage of the actual Nobel ceremony and no speeches were given.  Yet, we can forgive the latitude taken because the story is so inspirational.<br />From a production standpoint, special note must be given to the makeup department, which ages Russell Crowe so magnificently.  As the movie progresses through four decades, Nash is realistically depicted and aged appropriately.  Likewise, the art department does a fine job rendering four different periods, matching costumes, props and sets to the times.<br />Yet, with all the fine production values, this film excels most in the acting.  Russell Crowe turns in a career performance in a career abundant in great performances.  This character is the antithesis of the Russell Crowe we've come to expect.  Instead of strong, tough and balanced, with a sharp worldly intelligence, he plays an eccentric and convoluted man with quirks, nervous habits and a psyche obviously out of balance.  Crowe completely immerses himself in the enormous volume of the role, effortlessly moving between its elements from audacity to paranoia to tenderness to genius.  This is an accomplishment that is light years beyond his Academy Award performance in \\"Gladiator\\", good as it was.<br />Jennifer Connelly puts herself on the map with an Oscar for best supporting actress.  It is always difficult to avoid getting lost in the presence of an actor as powerful as Crowe, but Connelly stays right with him, delivering a moving performance as Nash's steadfast wife.<br />Ed Harris was my favorite to nose out Crowe for best actor in last year's Academy Awards.  Harris gave a brilliant performance playing Jackson Pollock in \\"Pollock\\" (also featuring Jennifer Connelly in a small role) that was trampled under by the \\"Gladiator\\" Oscar juggernaut.  As if to say, \\"If you can't beat him, join him\\", Harris goes toe to toe with Crowe in some of the most intense scenes in the film.  Harris lends significant energy and intrigue to the movie with an urgent performance as the operative who recruits Nash to break codes for the government.<br />This film is nothing short of fantastic.  It is expertly directed, superbly acted and meticulously crafted.  It presents great drama while also bringing insight into a stigmatizing disease to a wide audience.  I rated it a 10/10.  It rightfully ran away with the BestPicture Oscar.  If you see only one motion picture this year, make sure it is this one.

One step further into the details, however, would have made this book the last word on the subject.<br />If you have a little imagination, however, it is not too hard to fill in the details. Actually, since the author is a very respected Hungarian shoemaker, I can imagine it being a difficult decision on where to draw the line between &quot;details&quot; and &quot;wordiness.&quot; Do you have to talk about glue viscosity (he does) or glue recipes (he doesn't, &quot;shop secrets&quot;). Plenty of information is included and hundreds of excellent photos make it easy to imagine yourself right alongside a master craftsman.<br />Topics include:<br />* taking measurements <BR>* anatomy<BR>* shoe sizes<BR>* history and making of lasts<BR>* characteristics of different styles of men's dress shoes<BR>* design of the pattern (the gist of it, anyway)<BR>* leather tanning processes<BR>* characteristics of different leathers<BR>* clicking, brogueing, stitching and reinforcing of uppers<BR>* lasting the shoe (stretching the upper around the last)<BR>* lots of detail on tacking and stitching during the lasting process<BR>* welting<BR>* soling (including the shank and cork filler)<BR>* building the heel<BR>* ornamentation and finishing<BR>* proper shoe care<BR>* short bios on the greatest workshops in Europe and America<br />Needless to say, I learned alot. I had no idea top-end shoes use wooden pegs to hold the heels on or that broken glass and bones are common tools in the trade. This is a very nice addition to my library.

Perhaps Dave should begin recording solo records to experiment without so much hassle from rabid &quot;DMB&quot; fans. It's been said that some of the bandmates weren't happy with Everyday, because basically, they weren't showcased as they were in the past. I don't think I'd care about the Carter Beauford Band. Or the Boyd Tinsley Band. Dave is the heart and soul of DMB and they sound best when they follow his instincts.<br />Every song on this cd is a quality lyric on top of a quality and catchy (why is that a dirty word?) rhythm track. Overall, the songs flow nicely and I've never skipped a song while listening.<br />Don't listen to critics of this album, most of them hated it before they ever heard it, spend their nights getting plastered at frat parties, and haven't listened to this cd a half-dozen times. This is quality music.

Every song from Bawitdawba to Black chic white guy is an awesome song, i still to this day wonder how the man decided what to make as his singles, and i still wonder why he chose the 4 he did as his singles.

I mean come on! The new voice is Vash from Trigun. Much Much Much Much better! to finish off the battle of the dubs, the original dub was confusing, corny, and annoying. the new dub is more emotional, aggresive, understanding and superior! There!
0446677450|2.0|Overall this book left a bad taste in my mouth.  The childhood story is obviously untrue.  I unfortunately did research on Kiyosaki and his book after I bought it.<br />There are much finer books about becoming financially independant out there.  Your Money or Your Life is a fine example.  I would give it the lowest rating of one star except that he does make a point that your house/mortgage is a liability which I highly agree with.<br />Most of what he writes about is covered in other books which are written MUCH better.

0312265859|2.0|I loved the first six books.  Seven was...  It contained material that seemed to be recycled from earlier books and detailed descriptions of Bob's poop.  We went from Bob's poop to Bob's puke.  Not much improvement at my house.  If there is a dumber main character than Stephanie Plum, I've missed the book.  She is such a colossal screwup and gets worse at being a bounty hunter instead of better.  I wasn't surprised that Ranger broke off the affair after one night.  Stephanie is incompetent at everything else, this seemed to be more...than a passionate affair.  Kloughn would be more her speed than Ranger or Joe.  Stephanie has gone from cute, endearing, gutsy to boring, incompetent, and about as smart as her grandmother who has also lost her charm. Book eight is more original than seven.  For that I rated it a 2-star, but it wasn't worth the price of the book.
B000069HKH|2.0|There's a couple of good songs, but a lot of it sounds very middle of the road. 9/11 is a very hard thing to write about, and having a multi-millionare sing in the voices of working class people who have suffered a very specific kind of loss is particularly awkward. He should've just written about it from his own perspective. Another thing is that he doesn't make much use of the E Street Band. Clarence Clemons is barely heard from, and counting Bruce, they've got three really good guitar players. Ideally the album should've sounded akin to Neil Young and Crazy Horse, with loud angry anthems and stark ballads. But most of it  sounds like John Mellencamp outtakes. Instead of sounding like Bruce, he sounds like a guy who wants to be Bruce.

B00003CX96|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, not just because I graduated from Indiana University, but because it strikes a true cord about growing up. The cast and character development are superb. Paul Dooley reminds me some of my father. The story and humor are on target. The scene where Dennis Christopher rides on the highway with the semi is a classic. And having lived in Bloomington for four years, it's fun to see familiar places. It doesn't matter, as a previous reviewer complained, that the editing takes you unexpectedly from the north part of campus to the south in a blink. Only IU students would notice that anyway. I arrived on campus the year they tore down the stadium where the race was filmed. As a freshman, I watched the movie at the IU Auditorium and then walked over to the stadium. What a kick! What a movie!

Her MTV Unplugged appearance showcases these qualities, as well as her exquisite dancing in songs such as the delectable &quot;Ojos Así.&quot; Her lyrics are honest and her range profound, making this concert truly one of her best.<br />Both this DVD and the accompanying CD are highly recommended to fans and admirers alike. It's rare to find a recorded performance as exquisite as this.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I like Mayer's voice so much that I overlook some of the dumb lyrics he writes.<br />If Mayer gets any comparisons to known artists, that's because there are so few singer/songwriters out there now.<br />I think Mayer's got the freshest voice I've heard in years.
B00005O5UK|5.0|This is the album that got me listening to Tull.  These guys are great and my favorite band.  Ian Anderson is incredable.  If you enjoy listening to Rock music then this is a must buy.
080019683X|5.0|My young grand daughter asked my husband and I to watch this video. We went to the video store; looked all over for it, and found it in the children's section.  After a short pause, we went ahead and rented it and we were both so glad we did.  Since we saw it, we have been looking for it in the stores, and just found and ordered it here.  We just received it and watched it again, and it is one of the most touching and memorable stories we've ever watched.  Both of us enjoyed the entire movie, from beginning to end, and now can watch it as many times as we want, which I'm sure will be often.  The story is so touching and cute, with a lot of strength, unselfishnes, and love shown on the part of the young girl.  It's so cute, you just want to watch it again, and it becomes a topic of conversation when good video's are brought up among friends and family.  I highly recommend this movie to children and adults alike and am so grateful to my grand daughter for pushing us to see it.
B00005LQ04|5.0|Suspiria will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat from the moment it begins until its credits start to roll.  You will not always know exactly what is going on...and some of the transitions between scenes lack transition...but all will unravel in bloody gore before your eyes!<br />The soundtrack to this film lures you into the film...it is like the feeling you get when fingernails scratch the chalkboard...it creates a suspense within you that actually heightens what is actually happening on the screen... Without the soundtrack, this film would not work...It is one of the best, maybe even the best use of a soundtrack with film.<br />I opted for the 3 disc Limited Edition set which gives you the film along with extras including a 52 minute interview with priciples of the film looking back 25 years...AND..best of all...<br />the chilling Soundtrack CD by Goblin. &quot;La la la la la la la...&quot;
B00003CXI1|4.0|Though by no means the only example of the subject, Joanne Rowling's imaginative book about an eleven year old boy discovering his new-found talent for magic, reintroduced the age-old genre of the fairy story to modern children. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; benefits enormously from modern CGI effects to bring to life a film which will entertain everyone. The basic story concerns an orphaned boy living with his appalling cousins who are determined that he should not find out that he was actually born a wizard. Through outside help from the magical community, he finds himself enrolled at Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the fun starts.<br />Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane and Alan Rickman help to back up the principal child stars and give this film some real presence. Daniel Radcliffe is rather flat as Harry Potter and Emma Watson, as the precocious Hermione Granger, is excessively theatrical and both are shaded by Rupert Grint who is excellent in the role of their cynical friend, Ron Weazley. No doubt all the child actors will improve with time, given that they stay with the series. At the moment they are still finding their feet.<br />There are plenty of special effects to amaze and amuse and I can't imagine how such a film could have been made without them. The cinematography by John Seale, ACS, is excellent and the whole film has a very pleasing look. The two-disc DVD set has many extras, some of which seem to require an intimate knowledge of magic to access.<br />On the whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I wait with baited breath for the sequels. It is not a five star film; I did not expect it to be, but it certainly rates considerable merit. I have yet to figure out why WB chose to release it as anything other than &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone&quot;, since that is both the title of the original book and the title of the film in any other market than the US. Apart from a few little blemishes, an excellent movie. Kids will give it five stars; parents will enjoy it, too. Thoroughly recommended.
078061755X|4.0|Armin Mueller Stahl dominates \\"Shine\\" just as the father he plays dominated the film's subject, David Helfgott, a brilliant pianist crushed under the weight of implacable, savage, unremitting paternal love and expectation. Again and again the film's hardest scenes are those in which a savage beating, with fists or words or towels, is followed by an embrace, cloying and suffocating, and the litany \\"No one will ever love you like I do..if you leave you will be punished the rest of your life...only the strong survive.\\"<br />Scott Hicks' movie opens with a piano competition where David, eight, is already cowed enough to not answer when asked the title of the piece that he will play. The father answers. The child plays, brilliantly, even following the piano as it rolls away across the stage, but he does not win. Daddy marches away furious.<br />Daddy's folks were boiled up in the camps and Daddy's own father, a stern and irreligious presence still tacked on the wall in the tiny, tin walled hut they share with two sisters and mother firmly under thumb, Daddy's Daddy wouldn't let Daddy have music when Daddy was young, Daddy, as he recalls again and again to David, saved up his pennies when he was young to buy a violin and what did Daddy's Daddy do? Daddy smashed it, with his fist. Just like that. Which is why David is very lucky, a very lucky boy to have his piano. What is he? Say it, he should say it. And David says just how lucky he is.<br /><br />The Rachmaninov 3 Concerto eventually breaks his mind. Or rather, the pressure built up around winning it, winning the encounter with his music, winning, finally, in these small bantam weight contests of life. While waiting to be told the outcome of the Australian state contest he waits with his main rival. \\"It's tough isn't it Roger?\\" he says. \\"It's a blood sport,\\" Roger replies and goes on, shudderingly relieved, to win. \\"Shine\\" is above all an examination of the consequences of not winning, at life, the consequences of being forced to feel winning the only thing, of being forced to try and accomodate one pressure, be it a father or an absolute perfection to attempt, and failing, necessarily, to measure up.<br /><br />The comparison that comes to mind quite early on is Jane Campion's first feature \\"An Angel at My Table\\", with its portrait likewise of an artist who detours through mental illness to arrive  at recognition. \\"Shine\\" has a different narrative structure, starting with Geoffrey Rush's grown up and all but mentally incompetent Helfgott, charming but looney except when at the piano, then flashing back to that eight year old competitor and everything that followed to explain the continuing present in which he finally finds a place to play the piano to unconditional adulation (a restaurant), a woman who loves him and provides, likewise, unconditional affection (Lynn Redgrave) and finally the return to the concert stage. The thing is, Jane Campion imbues her artist's passage through the veil with mystical, mysterious, somehow beguiling images that throw upon the universe the colours of her life. Hicks' Helfgott is just left out in the rain frequently, in fact with such continuing regularity that you wish they'd just stick an umbrella in his hand - surely it can't have rained all night and every night in the outback and this seems like cheap sympathy begging and betrays the basic lack of grandeur to the film-maker's vision. \\"He's pitiful because he can't get in out of the rain, poor duck.\\" This sort of thing grates on your viewer, after a while.<br />The performances are uniformly strong, notably Noah Taylor as the teenage prodigy, probably more haunting than Rush's grown up loon and straddling effortlessly the range from cowering terror, quizzical humour, longing, love and passionate nay psychotic and guileless devotion to the art. Gielgud does his usual cameo as the music master whose performance you might paint by numbers, though a moment when he tells of playing the Rachmaninov3 for the man himself is touching, and the film is full of such moments. But finally, as the now calmer though still frantic Helfgott is walking from his father's grave with his calm, practical wife who says \\"There is a reason for everything,\\" you wonder if that's enough of an answer to give to tragedy, enough of a vision even to append after a tragedy. Jane Campion leaves her heroine in \\"Angel at My Table\\" writing alone at night in a caravan and listening \\"to the sea, to the sea\\". I wished many times in this movie that this hero, so crushed by the quotidian and torn apart by one man's experience of hell, might have accounted more for wonder, might have made the world a little more explicable in its fall.the man himself is touching, and the film is full of such moments.

B000068PQ0|3.0|as a big flaming lips fan i am completely disappointed by this album. it is certainly a sister album to the soft bulletin, but it by far weaker than its predecesor. <br />wayne coyne is not the greatest storyteller lyrically, he is best at creating bizarre images and off the wall humor. he is best when less straight forward. in this album he devotes himself completely to storytelling, and it comes off as isaac asimov meets marvel comics. certainly the soft bulltin was an album that had alot of storytelling, but yoshimi is not supported by nearly as brilliant music as the former. this one is sort of like yanni goes electric.<br />many people say they would like radiohead to go back to their guitars, but strangely the flaming lips have gotten none of this pressure, but radiohead is alot better at creating electronica than the lips are. <br />if you are planning on getting a lips album, i would strongly urge you not to start with this one. in fact i would say get any album they made after a priest driven ambulance. the lips are a great band, and they have created great albums, but sadly this just isn't one of them.
0316666343|5.0|I'd never heard of Alice Sebold, so when People magazine raved about her new book, I was a little skeptical. But when I read the review, I was instantly intrigued, so I bought the book. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. The characters were so real and alive, even Susie who was supposed to be dead. They were dynamic and active people with flaws and cracks. To see how Sebold characterized Susie, which I believe would be the hardest part, was uplifting to a blossoming author---it can be done! I had never read a book with a story quite like this. This is real stuff, and it's wonderful. I encourage everyone to read this book---it was absolute genius, very enjoyable, and heartbreaking as well.
B000069HKH|5.0|There have been a few people who called this album &quot;mediocre&quot;.  I have a real problem with that.  Had they given this album a FULL listen and kept an open mind, I think they would have found this album (like I did) to be nothing short of perfection.  In short, this is Bruce's best ever.  I was raised on his stuff, and while I was a little concerned when I heard what his intentions were with &quot;The Rising&quot;, I picked it up the day it was released.  Upon first listening, within the first few seconds of &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, I was overcome with happiness to hear the E Street band again.  It brings a certain feeling of comfort, kind of like a visit from an old friend. <br />&quot;The Rising&quot; starts off strong and only gets stronger.  Bruce bit off a large bite with this one, but it wasn't more than he could chew. He pulled it off with more grace than anyone I can think of.  It may take a couple of listens for one to really get into the flow of the whole album, but once you're there, you'll find this one to be a true classic that will be looked back on with the same fondness and adoration as &quot;Nebraska&quot; or &quot;Born in the U.S.A&quot;.  Go and get this one NOW.
B00000IKSC|5.0|the show was great i just wished i was there in person. must be for any bsb fans and nick well he looked a babe.
B00006690H|3.0|Slim kicks off The Eminem Show with a war-cry against censorship in White America, the song that hooked me, precisely because it criticizes the US at a time when that's so unpopular - until the track ends, and Em laughs, \\"just playin' America, you know I love you\\".  The self-contradiction, threaded through every song, forces you to wonder just what the real story is under all the layers of \\"just playin'.\\"  It's never clear.  The album as a whole is a statement about fiction and reality in the entertainment business, generously sprinkled with lots of woe-is-me's and gratuitous ... images,  I especially like the reenactment of Slim's little \\"pistol-whipping\\" run-in with a bouncer that landed him in jail;  his \\"Soldier\\" self-portrayal (too many video games, Marsh?) and blatant use of his album as a platform for self-defense (\\"that was a fist that hit you!\\") is, while entertaining, a little over the top.<br />But that's the beauty of this thing:  absolutely nothing is too personal or too raw for Em to discuss.  He gets down and dirty into his personal relationships as well, rapping about his desire to ... his wife (but work things out with her for his daughter's sake), his hatred for his mother (and sorrow he ever hurt her), his ...for his father (and a wistful moment of wondering whether or not he kissed baby Marshall when he left), and his fierce loyalty to his daughter.  The homage to little Hailie is the only unambiguous statement he makes; yet the song a few tracks before \\"Hailie's Song\\" he's slapping a woman off a barstool or demanding she jump him.  This all amounts to a very fascinating study of male rage.<br />Overall, this album has the draw of a trashy reality show littered with expletives cleverly rhymed and laid over a set of frighteningly contagious beats.<br />In other words, I can't stop listening to it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney Spears has been a wonderful artist from the start. Teenagers all over the world danced with her songs, which are wonderful. The first album was the best one, but this is one of those albums which are worth spending money on them.<BR>The songs are pretty cool and the lyrics too. It also comes with a special video of \\"Overprotected\\", with images from the movie.<br />She's really done it with songs like \\"Overprotected\\", \\"I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman\\", and \\"I Love Rock 'N Roll\\".<BR>While the first part of the album is more mature and is a bit stronger, the other half reminds us of the sweet Britney, singing and dancing as a teen. Both halfs are excellent, definitely much better that \\"Oops...I Did It Again\\", and that album was good.<br />So run to the stores to buy it. It won't let you down.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung baby is a better album by far than the joshua tree. ON the joshua tree it's like U2 just spent all their effort on the first 4 songs and that was it, the rest of the songs are soooooo blah, boring and there's no feeling. However, when you get to achtung baby it's so emotional, so deep, so lyrical you just can't help but notice how beautiful the album is. Im not a die hard U2 fan but i do notice good music when i hear it.  When im stressed out and tired i put on the cd and right away i feel like singing out the top of m y lungs along with bono and jumping up and down like crazy cuz it's very uplifting. This is a great album and i think everyone should own it!
B0000542D2|5.0|To quote from a review...\\"The Citizen Kane of Pop Musicals...\\" What can you say? The film that has never been equaled or reproduced by any rock act. What set the Beatles apart from other bands then and since, is that there were four distinct personalities in the group, and no matter if you liked them or not, the average rock afficionado can name all four members of the band. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT further enhanced this aspect and at the same time made one of the best rock movies of all time. The film is filmed in a black and white, quasi-documentary style, with great innovative camera work by director Richard Lester. Stripped down, it's a musical comedy based on a 'day in the life' of the Beatles as they are preparing for a press conference and rehearsing for an upcoming appearance on a television program in London. Foregoing the traditional musical where a scene is set up to segue into a musical number, the Beatles play themselves and inject musical numbers at random points with great success and fun. Its not like an Elvis movie where he sings to the bad guy after he beats him up, the musical spots are like modern musical videos. Great classic songs like \\"Can't buy Me Love\\", \\"She Loves You\\", \\"If I Fell\\", \\"And I Love Her\\", etc.. are used in the film and a good time is had by all. Pretty good natural comedic performances by the Fab Four . A film that's in a league all its own. Fun!!<br />- - -However, the newly released DVD by Miramax is not a very good in the bells and whistles.  It mostly contains interviews from people we don't care about.  There should have been deleted scenes and outtakes.  Now that would have been better.  The most disappointing thing is the soundtrack. In the films climactic concert scenes in the television theatre studio, the audience girls screaming IS MUTED INTERMITTANTLY to keep the integrity of the songs. It sounds and looks as if the Beatles are singing to an empty theatre. Any Beatlephile knows that the screams from the girls was an integral part of their live shows and what made the concert scene in the film authentic...part of their live shows and what made the concert scene in the film authentic...
B0000029AP|5.0|Aerosmith came into their own on this album, both creatively and commercially. While 1974's 'Get your wings' was a superb effort by anyones standards, the combination of fairly derivative hard rock, funk, pop and lashings of innuendo showcased on this album set the scene for a prolific, constantly remarkable career.<br /> While not as gritty and raw as its equally wonderful follow up 'Rocks' it was this recording which saw Aersomith discover their signature sound, as well as inaugurating the strategy of pop sensibilities grafted to a hard rocking base which made them so compelling and eventually a household name.<br />  Housing the mega hits 'Walk this way' (15 years before the crossover re-issue which heralded their comeback) and 'Sweet emotion' as it does, this album could hardly fail to be massive. Yet it is the other, lesser known songs included which propel it to greatness: the speedy romp of the opening title track, a live favourite to this day or the thoughtful 'Uncle Salty', which tackles issues more recently and famously brought to the fore on 'Janies got a gun'. Add to these the fantastic bluesy number 'Adams Apple' in which Tyler muses in typically comic fashion upon the origins of mankind, the beautifully dreamy 'No More No More', the sinister, spiralling 'Round and Round' and the emotive, powerful 'You see me crying' a kind of prototype for the power ballads of the 80's although with a far more mature delivery, and the strength of this recording becomes apparent.<br />  To conclude: Aerosmith may not have been the most original band recording in 1974, but the sheer quality of this album would present a tough obstacle for anyone arguing they were not the best. Their amalgamation of Stones-esque rock, Zeppelin style ryhthms and bluesy swagger is hardly in fashion today, yet any rock fan or student of music as a whole should be ashamed not to own this recording.<br />Buy it and wonder how you ever lived without it.
B00005JL0I|4.0|This was made in the mid 1960's, at the hight of the Bond Boom and popular legend has it that it was an artistic and comercial disaster. Althogh it did better at the box office than it is often given credit it had massive production costs and it certanly isn't as well made as the official Bond films but it is also not without merit.<br />It has a wonderful cast headed by David Niven and Peter Sellers along with the good and the great of British comedy from the period. Ursula Andress is the female lead and unlike her apearance in \\"Dr. No\\", we at least get to hear her real voice; her exotic cosumes were designed by Julie Harris who went on to perform a similar service in \\"Live and Let Die\\".<br />The photography is surperb and the digital remastering makes it truly a feast for the eyes. The production design is at least comparable with the EON series. <br />My favorite aspect of the film is Bert Bacharach's score; almost every scene has its own tune and each one is a delight.  \\"The Look Of Love\\" has to be one of the most sensual songs ever writen for a film and it has the images to match! Bacharach and David worked hard to capture the movement of Ursula Andress and they more than succeded.<br />The only thing that lets the movie down is that it is episodic feel to the whole film (probably because of the numerous directors) and the fact that it is about twenty minutes too long. It is hard to sustain tounge in cheek humour for over two and a half houres.<br />The Austin Powers films owe a lot to this and several other movies of the period (\\"Our Man Flint\\"  the Matt Helm Movies etc.) and its fun to see where he got his insperation.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Two thumbs WAY up for this masterpiece of a movie.  I love it i love it i love it.  Nicole and Ewan are just awesome!  i had no idea that they could sing soooo well.  it's one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen.  I recommend that everyone see it....but it is one of those movies that you either hate or love it.  but whoever hates it is WEIRD!!  <br />the first time i saw this movie i completely sobbed.  i just broke down and cried so hard.  so don't say you haven't been warned---you WILL cry!  no doubt about that!
B00003OSTN|5.0|This movie gets five stars in my book because having watched it on television just once and then only a child, surrounded by my jabbering brothers and sisters, in what seems like a hundred years ago, even so I have never forgotten how much I wanted to climb inside that old telly and bash that ingrates face in. Joan in this movie was superb, and though I know she is an icon who's done loads of movies, and I have probably caught most by now on rainy weekends and late at night, I cannot remember any but this one. Joan Crawford as Mildred Pierce gave a performance that should rank as the zenith of acting skill....the measure by which all female leads are held.
B000069HKH|4.0|I can remember the summer of 1975, slightly drunk at a party and trying to explain to a girl I had just met why \\"Born to Run\\" was going to save rock and roll from turning into corporate pap. Twenty-five years later, rock had become just that, and I was tired of alternative rock with it's incessant whining (Kurt Cobain let everyone down big time). I started to switch to jazz to find music that was the product of something other than marketing and focus groups. Now The Boss is back again with the E Street Band, middle-aged with kids and a mortgage, but still with something to say. \\"The Rising\\" hasn't been out of my cd player since I bought it. It isn't \\"Born to Run\\" (still his masterpiece) it's Classic Springsteen like \\"Born in the USA\\" or \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\"; (you can tell The Boss has been listening to a lot of U2 in his down time) virile, sinewy, yet thoughtful and poetic, with a maturity befitting his 52 years. Thus far there are only two songs about September 11th that will be remembered 50 years from now: Alan Jackson's \\"Where Were You?\\" and Springsteen's \\"Into the Fire\\". One small quibble: you'd think the cover art could have been something a little more artistic than a blurred black and white photo of The Boss. It looks like a snapshot taken 50 years ago with a Kodak Brownie. Cheap, cheap, cheap!
B000063DI9|5.0|I remember when this album first came out.  I had just become a huge Maiden fan after the previous record Somewhere In Time.  By this time, I had bought their back catalogue of studio albums and was swept up by the hype surrounding the release of Seventh Son. I remember Bruce Dickinson being interviewed on MTV's Headbanger's Ball and stating this album would be \\"quite popular to people who have never seen this band before\\" because it was the best album they had made to date and it was going to take Maiden in new, exciting directions.  Then I saw the video for \\"Can I Play With Madness,\\" and that whetted my appetite even more (O.K., many fans at the time thought the song was too commercial, but it is still awesome and one of their best singles ever!).  I recall bugging the record store clerks many times with \\"Have you got the new Iron Maiden album in yet?\\" I don't think I have ever been so excited about an album release before or since!  When I finally bought it (I wanted it on cassette, but the store was out so I opted for vinyl because I couldn't wait), I think I was slightly disappointed at first.  My expectations were a bit too high. But the more I played it, the more I liked it.  When I listen to it now, after all this time, I can really appreciate the genius of it.  A true conceptual album about a child born with clairvoyant powers (the seventh son of a seventh son), who did not ask to be born this way and has problems dealing with the strange circumstances he finds himself in as well as the forces of good and evil battling for his soul.  The music is brilliant, with accoustical guitar, keyboards and other additions to transform Maiden's sound.  In retrospect, Seventh Son was the last great Maiden album.  Instead of being a stepping stone to more Maiden innovations, it proved to be Maiden's peak.  Things seemed to go down hill after this record, with Adrian Smith and Dickinson eventually leaving to work on their own projects.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the greatest cd ever made. It has everything and then some. Thom displays his vocals with the greatest music to back him up. Johnny's and Ed's guitars, Phil's drums, Collin's bass, Thom's acoustic work. The whole cd is awsome, but if you are just getting into the band, good songs to get hooked on are &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;Karma Police&quot;, &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot; and &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot;....If you have not yet experienced OK COMPUTER, then you must press ADD TO CART and enjoy a whole new outlook on British Music.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|One of the best starters for possible new Beatle fans. Well, I believe there are two kinds of people in the world of popular music. The ones who believe in the Beatles and the ones who don't. To be honest, I didn't believe in them before but when I gave them a try via a friend's recommendation I just couldn't stop. So this is an excellent choice for starters. I'm particularly more fond of the Beatles' later works (1965-1970) when they did a lot of the so called \\"experimentation of sound.\\" Experiment they did and came out definitely successful. Might I suggest to Apple/Capitol/EMI to make a compilation focusing on their experimentations. The title could be: \\"PSYCHEDELIC 1.\\" And the songs are as follows:<br />1. Taxman<BR>2. Magical mystery tour<BR>3. Everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey<BR>4. Nowhere man<BR>5. With a little help from my friends<BR>6. Getting better<BR>7. Lovely Rita<BR>8. She said she said<BR>9. Rain<BR>10. Tomorrow never knows<BR>11. Helter skelter<BR>12. Glass onion<BR>13. Strawberry fields forever<BR>14. I am the walrus<BR>15. The continuing story of Bungalow Bill<BR>16. I'm only sleeping<BR>17. Because<BR>18. She's leaving home<BR>19. Norwegian wood (this bird has flown)<BR>20. Lucy in the sky with diamonds<BR>21. I want you (she's so heavy)<BR>22. Dear Prudence<BR>23. You never give me your money<BR>24. A day in the life<br />     It's possible that many might oppose to this line up of songs or that some songs doesn't deserve to be on this compilation. I understand. I'm only trying to suggest these songs to EMI. And I'm just pointing out to EMI and the Beatle fans there are Beatle songs out there that are worth more that aren't just getting much attention and I believe these songs sure do deserve it! I don't know if this compilation will be a megahit but I'm sure it will still sell much because most probably for collecting reasons or digital remastering. I just wish they'll buy them for the songs as well how the tracks are arranged and structured. Thank you for taking time reading my review and may the Lord Bless you all.
B00005N8JG|5.0|I confess the opening bars of Jon Hopkins debut album had me worried. A sample of waves lapping on a beach, a crescendo of discordant notes and reverse cymbals building to a patented Pink Floyd swell. Thankfully, the guitar sound which follows is not a monolithic Dave Gilmour tremelo, but a beautiful, plaintive tinkling, as bright and clean as a summer's day. It soon becomes obvious that there are to be more clichés in these first 30 seconds than in the 55 minutes which follow. <br />The 21-year-old Hopkins was playing piano from the age of five, and by the age of twelve he was studying piano and composition at the Royal College of Music, where he won, amongst other awards, the Concerto Prize. It cannot be easy to carry the tag 'musical genius' from childhood into the adult world of dance music, where technicianship is so easily mistaken for musicianship. Yet Hopkins shows considerable restraint. There is no showmanship here, no arrogant flourishes, just a perfectly constructed, beautifully arranged, minor masterpiece of downtempo melody and mood. <br />'Opalescent' has a lush velvetiness that is not a million miles from Zero 7, a smoothness of delivery that is pure Groove Armada, topped with the confidence to venture into more challenging and darker moods. The twelve instrumentals work beautifully as late night incidental music, but pay close attention and you will find a veritable smorgasboard of subtle, compelling rhythmic variations, touches of virtuoso piano and guitar tucked away in the mix, melodic threads that slowly wrap themselves around your head, and trip-hop beats that arrive with the sudden inevitablity of a Roald Dahl twist. <br />Case in point, 'Private Universe', begins with some gentling bubbling, soft synth chords. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, a soft sweep of strings slides in, then some bass, then four minutes later you are swinging along to a full band and thinking, where did all that sound come from? There are numerous similar examples, the slightly sinister 'Cold Out There', the pure, sparkling 'Halcyon', the compelling, climactic 'Cerulean'. <br />More than anything, 'Opalescent' sounds like the album William Orbit might have made if, instead of chasing Madonna's moolah, he had followed his Strange Cargo series through to a natural, magical conclusion. An enormously promising debut. -AF
B000002UAX|5.0|I'm particularly more fond of the Beatles' later works (1965-1970) when they did a lot of the so called \\"experimentation of sound.\\" And Experiment they did and they came out indeed successful at it. And one of those experiments is through this album. Although each had different ideas of musical expression the album still came out roaring like a lion. My favorite track is most probably Dear Prudence. What addicting guitar plucks and I was amazed hearing this kind of sound way back in the late 60's. Highly recommended. If only <BR>Apple/Capitol/EMI can make a compilation focusing on their experimental years it would be great!!! It can be a 2nd Beatle One. The title could be: \\"PSYCHEDELIC 1.\\" And the songs are as follows:<br />1. Taxman<BR>2. Magical mystery tour<BR>3. Everybody's got something to hide except for me and my monkey<BR>4. Nowhere man<BR>5. With a little help from my friends<BR>6. Getting better<BR>7. Lovely Rita<BR>8. She said she said<BR>9. Rain<BR>10. Tomorrow never knows<BR>11. Helter skelter<BR>12. Glass onion<BR>13. Strawberry fields forever<BR>14. I am the walrus<BR>15. The continuing story of Bungalow Bill<BR>16. I'm only sleeping<BR>17. Because<BR>18. She's leaving home<BR>19. Norwegian wood (this bird has flown)<BR>20. Lucy in the sky with diamonds<BR>21. I want you (she's so heavy)<BR>22. Dear Prudence<BR>23. You never give me your money<BR>24. A day in the life<br />     The time span of this compilation is 79'54\\" which is a well-worth cd time duration.<br />     It's possible that many might oppose to this line up of songs or that some of the songs doesn't deserve to be on this \\"imaginative\\" compilation. I understand. I'm only trying to suggest this to EMI. And I'm just pointing out to EMI and the Beatle fans there are Beatle songs out there that are worth more listening and that they aren't just getting much attention and I believe these songs sure do deserve such!!! I'm not sure if it's going to be a megahit but I know it will sell much because the songs are worth pure gold. May the Lord Bless you all.
B000003S0P|5.0|\\"Red\\" is the work of a band at its artistic and performance peak.  Stripped down to a power trio format,  guitarist Robert Fripp, percussionist Bill Bruford and bassist/vocalist John Wetton produced an astounding recording---it's hard to believe it was recorded in 1974.  The level of musicianship eclipses all the bands' previous works, and only the 80s release \\"Discipline\\" comes close to matching the blend of ferocity and songwriting.  Fripp's guitar work is both spare and riveting;  Bruford's percussion work is meticulous, and Wetton's growling, monster bass tone still stands as a reference for bassists nearly thirty years on.<br />Best track is \\"Red\\" with its staccato guitar work and the Wetton's grinding bass tone in the fore and Bruford holding it all together. It's worth buying the disc for this song alone.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I have alot of respect for Jim Carrey as an actor.The thing is that people never give him the chance to do a drama film.He has been in many comendy films in which he rolls his eyes and goes crazy such as The Grinch,Liar Liar,and The Cable Guy.Now he does The Majestic a film in which he is never running around and jumping and throwing stuff like he always does.Instead he is calm and talks like a normal person and does nice things.And then nobody goes to see the movie.<br />At a whopping 152 minutes The Majestic is an epic tale about a Hollywood screenwriter named Peter Appleton in the 1950's who is acused of being a Communist because he attended meeting with a girl.He did not know the meetings were of Communist activity.After a tragic accendent in the water he passes out and ends up on a beach where his whole life is going to change.<br />On this town next to the beach called Lawson California.There he meets Harry Trimble who thinks that Peter is really his long lost son Luke who was lost in the war.Peter doesn't remember anything prior to waking up on the beach and then becomes Luke.<br />As Luke he meets Adale who was his girlfriend 9 1/2 years ago.Then he was missing in the line of duty.But now the FBI smells something fishy because why would an American run away after being accused of being a Communist?<br />The Majestic is a wonderful film that will always be one of my favorites.<br />ENJOY!
0679731725|5.0|I have read a lot of books lately, including several Booker Prize winners, and this one stands out in my mind, far better than the other Booker winners I have read. It seems to characterize the spirit oif the Booker Prize, because it is a fine analysis of English culture in an age of transition from the traditional class-based, industry-fueled age of the British, to building the modern Britain after the jolt of World War II. It humanizes the character of the butler, who has in the past been used as a stereotype of tradional British culture, like Wodehouse's Jeeves, with his stiff-upper lip. The story is fascinating and the psychological conflict is subtle but powerful.
B000066NW0|3.0|The \\"anti-Britney\\"? Sure, whatever you say. Honestly, this is just a throwback to those halcyon days of oh, say 1997, when every week it seemed there was yet another angry young woman yelling at her mom through the tv screen, each one as real as could be, & each one sounding exactly like the one we'd just heard...to be fair, though, I have to admit that some of the songs on this lp are pretty damned catchy, and while there is nothing here to justify the carpet-bombing of self-important hype that preceded this release, still, catchy is nothing to sniff at in these drab, tuneless days (then again, maybe you LIKE Papa Roach). Frankly, if you're looking for Important Insights into Today's Teenage Girl, I'd suggest you stick with Pink (the real anti-Britney), but if you've ever wondered what Leslie Gore might sound like if she were making records now, then I couldn't think of a better guide than \\"Let Go\\".
B0000042H4|5.0|Let's be honest:  first, one has an outstanding Wagnerian orchestra and conductor, who give this recording (without excessive playing troubles!) the sonorities needed, while allowing the music to speak for itself, never rushed nor overly slow for most tastes.  Secondly, the cast is very hard to beat overall (yes, one can fault this or that singer, but there are no major miscasts...);  and thirdly, the job done with Decca/London's engineers is utterly outstanding!  The extra effects don't get in the way, but enhance what not only is the best Ring recording period overall in itself but which also would be the ideal soundtrack to any movie made out of it!  [Yes, I could wish to see some things done differently, but it's impossible to get everything perfect, especially with a cycle of this nature!]  Definitely a must-have for all classical-music connoisseurs!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|From what I was expecting, this is a pretty solid album. At first listen, some of the songs reminded me of an 80's Mellencamp album. Sorry Bruce! But hey, it's a good album worth listening to over and over!
0679805273|5.0|Always optimistic though never unrealistic and not too idealist!  This creative book offers lots of wisdom and loads of wit.  Behind the clever rhymes and cute illustrations the message is clear; Life isn't always easy but the hard spots never last forever.  This book promotes perseverance, self-reliance and ambition in fun and simple poetry.  Kids of all ages (since everyone is someone's kid) will gain something by reading or being read this book.<br />Profound versus are found on every page, but the best, in my opinion, are the ones about the surrealistic and symbolic \\"Waiting Place\\", which end with these lines.<br />\\"Waiting, perhaps for their Uncle Jake, or a pot to boil, or a Better Break, or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants, or a wig with curls, or Another Chance. Everyone is just waiting.\\"
B00005QG9J|5.0|this album is the best to come out of the southern californian rockers yet.  it shows a maturity in brandon boyds songwriting not yet seen from him.  it goes from the rocking nice to know you to the bittersweet mexico to the chilling aqueous transmission.  it goes from electric giutar riffs to soft acoustic.  my personal faveourite song has to be either 11 am or blood on the ground both induvidual rock masterpieces.  to sum it all up for me this one of the best rock albums ever recorded at least in the last 20 years (even if the last song does go on for a bit)
B000002UVZ|5.0|What more need I say?  It stands up over time.  I just wish we could understand Stipe's voice more of the time.  I can't sing along if I can't understand what he's saying.
B00004YC2F|5.0|Few pianists have the sheer power of sound, dexterity, and brilliance of interpretation of Arcadi Volodos.  This collaboration (and it is definitely that) with James Levine and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra results in the most perfect Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto on records.  The pianist is  a Romantic Poet who pays heed to all the pathos and melancholy hidden beneath the surface of this relentlessly testing concerto while pulling from the keyboard all the fire and dazzling virutosity inherent in this piece.  Levine is at one with Volodos and when they are tutti the effect is nearly unbearably beautiful.  And as if the performance of the concerto weren't enough, Vlodos comes back for encores that include samples of the Preludes, the Morceaux de salon, and a wondrous piano transcription of a Rachmaninoff work for cello and piano.  The quality of production of this live performance is so well engineered that you would swear you were hearing the 'perfect studio recording'.  But then that luminous quality of listening to music in the hall with the electricity of a nonstop performance makes the concerto truly sing.  No matter how many recordings you may have of this oft recorded concerto, you will find much new and revealing here!  Highly Recommended!
B000065V3H|2.0|This movie is easily 5 or MORE stars.  But the DVD only gets two.  Picture is fine but it is not in widescreen format!  Totally unacceptable for a DVD to come out in 2002.  Love the movie.  One of my absolute favorites.
B000001FC0|5.0|Tears For Fears music has endured very well, far better than alot of music from the 1980s. What TFF put in their music was depth and creativity, something alot of other music at the time and especially now lacks.<br />There were two huge hits off The Big Chair. Shout is one of the angriest and heaviest songs with it's blasting guitars and angry lyrics. Everybody Wants To Rule The World is the other one. EWTRTW is one of the best songs that 1985 offered. There was one lesser hit and that was Head Over Heals.<br />In my opinion I like the parent album version more than the version on both the Tears Roll Down(Greatest Hits 82-92) &amp; Shout: Very Best Of TFF mainly because the song ends with a live performance of Broken as an attachment for a more incredible listen.<br />The best song though in my opinion is The Working Hour. This track my favorite song off The Big Chair. It's a very intense song that begins with as an eerie track but then African drums come in and then a huge wash of powerful synthesizers and rock guitars come in.<br />The other track to point out is the final track(On the 8 song editon of this CD)Listen. Listen is a very apocolyptic song with a cold brooding atmosphere that is more intensified with the industrial mechanical beats and sound effects combined with dark melodies.<br />The Big Chair was re-issued in 1999 with seven bonus tracks added. The Big Chair(song title), Empire Building, &amp; Marauders  are also available on the brilliant B-Sides rarities collection Saturning Martial Lunatic. One track called The Conflict was previously unrealeased. The other three are remixes.<br />For those who might be turned off by the excessively abstract bonus tracks I wouls say get the older edition but for those want to start their TFF collections get the remastered editions of their first three albums. They're all worth owning.<br />A great album that was very well handled in it's reissue The Big Chair deserves a place in everyones music collection.<br />After this TFF would morph into a whole different sound with the artistic pinnacle known as The Seeds Of Love. <br />After this TFF would morph into a whole different sound with the artistic pinnacle known as The Seeds Of Love
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If I could only own one DVD, this would be it!  DVD seems to have been invented for Moulin Rouge-- capturing the precision of the dance choreography, the drama in the lyrics and finally giving the scene selection feature a useful purpose.   If you love musical romance you'll likely love it.   If you've never seen this unique film you may want to rent it before buying.  Some viewers are unhappily surprised by the modern music and exaggerated operatic style of the film, which is evident from the very first scene. In my opinion they just need to watch it more.  All the melodrama, strange characters, and surreal staging do come together when considered as a whole and the more times you watch it, the more you'll realize how perfectly.  Not only is the music memorable but the story, a classic love triangle tragedy, holds up extraordinarily well.  One can analyze the director's choices and characters' motives at length. Who is ultimately responsible for the love triangle Harold Ziddler or the lisping Duke? Which is better idealism or realism? Unlike most musicals films, Moulin Rouge covers many angles.
B000002PH1|5.0|Belinda Carlisle's 1987 masterpiece still sounds as fresh and original as it did when it was released.  Carried by angelic vocals that could melt your pants, and a brilliant lineup of songs among which there are no failures, Heaven on Earth is possibly the ultimate Belinda album to date - though not my personal favourite.  Among this double-platinum, planet-conquering effort are chart hits such as 'Heaven is a Place on Earth' and 'Circle in the Sand' and 'I Get Weak.'  But every song could easily have been a chart topper...The soothing lyrics of 'World Without You,' the haunting 'Love Never Dies,' the upbeat 'Fool For Love,' and the rocking 'Nobody Owns Me,' are all classic songs that don't deserve to be forgotten.  Thank God for the 80's. Thank God for Belinda Carlisle.
B0000640SA|5.0|I was able to buy this DVD when it appeared in my Amazon Gold Box (having a one-year-old in the house, the Gold Box is the only way I can buy DVD's anymore!), and I could not refuse the [inexpensive] price I was offered.  I'm very glad now that I opened my Gold Box at the right time.  Even at full-price, this is a must-see film.<BR>My first introduction to director Christopher Nolan's work was in Insomnia- another must-see if you haven't already.  <BR>As the Amazon review explains, Shelby Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man with an unusual mental condition that prevents him from creating new memories.  To complicate the situation, he is trying to search for his wife's murderer.  The police won't help him because they don't believe him- as they see it, the case is open-and-shut.<BR>The most effective way Christopher Nolan found to confuse the viewer (as much as Leonard must have been) was to portray the film in ten-minute segments- in reverse.  This technique reminded me a little of Tarantino's jump-around technique in Pulp Fiction, but \\"Memento\\" was more linear- the end of one segment was the beginning of the previous segment.<BR>Although I was expecting all of this from reading the other reviews here, I was not expecting to get as thorougly confused as I did.  I paid full attention to what was happening, but at the end I still felt like my head was spinning.  I have seen several movies that have left me confused (case in point: Eyes Wide Shut.  I'm sure Kubrick was a wonderful director, but I still don't get the way that film unfolded), but this left me pleasantly confused; I'm still thinking about it several days later, and enjoying the film even more in retrospect.<BR>The entire cast was well-chosen, from Guy Pearce as the fiercely determined Leonard, to Carrie-Anne Moss as the highly intriguing Natalie.  I'm still not sure if she was a \\"bad guy\\" or a \\"good guy.\\"  Joe Pantoliano (Moss' co-star in \\"The Matrix\\") was also excellent as John G./Teddy.<br />Although the beginning of the movie starts with finding out the identity of Leonard's wife's killer, the film is most definitely not that simple.  At the end, the film takes everything you've expected thus far and throws it upside-down.<BR>I don't typically get into \\"thinking person's\\" movies (neither does my husband), but this was one such movie that I'm sure I will be watching again, to see what I missed the first time around.<BR>For film buffs, the limited edition packaging is also a great perk: it is modeled after Leonard's evidence file in the film.
0316666343|3.0|I have to agree with &quot;What's the Fuss&quot;.  It was an ok read. however, hasn't this all been done before?
B00000K31V|4.0|In Canadian author William Gibson's novel Virtual Light, a Texan trailer park cult watched TV 24-7, looking for glimpses of God. David Cronenberg movies were pure evil, the Devil himself. Now as this is fiction based on fact and this cult to my knowledge doesn't actually exist. Cronenberg's movies do present a reality warping into paranoia, conspiracy and a bizarre sexuality. eXistenZ is no exception. In this film however the predominant element is the paranoia, the bizarre sexuality is subtle, but clearly there. Bio-ports are the gateway into a world that is already winning the battle against reality. Escaping into the twisted world where nothing is as it seems. Control of even your own speech and actions doesn't belong to you as you submit to game urges that push the plot along. And once in the this world you have to wonder if escape is wanted or even possible. <BR> Cronberg's horror this go round is a dreamlike as usual. Not inspiring shock, but bending the mind with questions. watch over, and over.
0671004107|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  I couldn't stop thinking about it after I read it, and I still think about it.  I've always believed in life on other planets, it's stupid to think we're alone, in my opinion anyway.  In this story Carl Sagan describes an intriguing and exciting scenario of how first contact with an alien species would be made.  He uses scientific facts and scientific theories as the basis of all the events that happen.  So it's more than a fantasy story, it's actually believable.  The movie contact, while it was good, made me very angry.  Sagan's story was about contact with aliens and just that, while the movie was about politics and conspiracy to gov't to hide information from the public.  I wish they'd stuck to the real story, which was more scientific than political.  Anyway, this book blew me away and I'd recommend it anyone.
B00003CXXO|1.0|A.I. is disappointing on several scales.   Marketing misrepresented the film by promoting shots of a laughing Haley Joel Osment but this film is filled with one depressing scene after another.   <br />The movie attempts to be a dark, twisted retelling of the Pinocchio story, a statement about discrimination, and a story about faith and love.   A.I. seems to have suffered from too many fathers.  Brian Aldiss created the characters in his short short, \\"Supertoys Last All Summer\\".  (Only David and Teddy remain true to his version.)   Stanley Kubrick originally planned the film and abandoned it before his death and Steven Spielberg inherited the project.      <br />Hally Joel Osment's performance as David is sincere and sophisticated but his characters flawed logic - find the blue fairy and become a \\"real\\" boy - is painful to watch.   <br />There are plotting problems as well.    Characters actions are inconsistent.   The \\"organic\\" humans are inexplicably brutal to the robots, even although they were created solely for the humans enjoyment.   A dense forest used as dumping ground for discarded robots contradicts the worldwide food shortages at the movie's premise.   Inexplicably, a working factory exists in an tremendously altered New York City, taking the film out of the realm of science fiction and into fantasy. <BR> <BR>The film is excessively long, with a strange, drawn out, straining-to-be-uplifting ending that doesn't really work.  A.I.'s biggest disappointment is that it lacks the heart of all other Spielberg movies.
B00005BJWM|5.0|I don't own too many DVDs, I mostly rent, because of the price.  However, the Apollo 13/Backdraft combo is just excellent.  I paid about [$$$] for the pack.  The general recording and sound quality on both DVDs is excellent.  While it is unfortunate that the Backdraft DVD doesn't offer any compelling extras, the Apollo 13 DVD more than makes up for it.  There are interviews with Ron Howard, Tom Hanks, and the other cast and crew members.  They talk about their parts, how the movie was made, and how they felt about representing this important part of American history.  <br />If anyone is at all a fan of Apollo 13, I highly recommend the DVD.  Of course, being packed with Backdraft, also an excellent movie, only increases the value.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Since the minute I put this CD in I haven't been able to stop listening. It is uplifting and fun to listen to. Being a teenager I listen to a lot of music. This past year I have tried to find some style of music that I can relate to and I have found this with \\"Room For Squares\\". The second the CD starts you feel as though you've just walked into a little California coffee house who is having a weekly open mike. The pure untainted lyrics make you feel carefree and happy. I would recommend anyone to check out this CD...
B00005R62N|5.0|Sorry I have to reply to an easiler review.<br />How can anyone say &quot;avoid&quot; the live version of Tyrant!?!? It's one of the defining moments in heavy metal history. Judas Priest blazed a trail that many followed, and this album is one of the all time greats within the genre. If you love metal and this isnt in your collection, you're seriously missing out.
B000005DQR|5.0|I'm not going to do a play by play analysis of why this album is great, I will say this, that it is one of the greatest peices of music ever recorded.  No album has been able to evoke such emotion in the listener ( me in this case ) than Entroducing, including vocal works.  It is consistent in theme and emotion through the whole album.  I had the pleasure of seeing Shadow live in Toronto a month ago and it was amazing, I've never felt anything like it, there was electricity in the air, it was probably the closest thing I've had to a religious experience in my life.  Do yourself a favor and get this album.
B000066NW0|4.0|Avril has a lot of different kinds of music in this C.D. from rock, hip hop, and to even some rap.  <BR>  <BR> I really don't like the first song Losing Grip, personally I think the tune (is not so good) (sounds like avril lavigne's tone deaf)but the lyrics are okay, people can relate to them. But this is probably one of the worst songs in the cd.<BR>   <BR>The next song is COMPLICATED, so I'll let u judge that song for yourself.I love this song<BR>   <BR>Third song is SK8ER BOI which has a pretty good tune but the lyrics can be pretty bad and corny at times.I like it this one. Catchy.<BR>   <BR>I'M WITH YOU is a real slow song that has a good tune and again some cheesy lyrics but what can I say its catchy and i sorta like it.<BR>   <BR>MOBILE is a medium paced song which had a good chorus and that's about it for that.<BR>  <BR> UNWANTED starts off sounding like a James Bond theme song and I can't say i like it that much. It is an anger driven song. She screams in it sometimes.<BR>  <BR> TOMORROW. For some reason I like this song. slow paced, nice lyrics, relaxing, sad... one of the better slow songs.<BR>   <BR>ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY is a medium paced beat song with okay lyrics.  It has a good chorus and it's another sad song. I like this song.<BR>   <BR>THINGS I'LL NEVER SAY is one of my favorite songs on this cd. A lot of the people can relate to the lyrics of this song and its fast paced, happy and sorry at the same time. Great chorus!!! Maybe avril lavigne's next hit.<BR>   <BR>MY WORLD nice tune, okay lyrics...nothing that spectacular<BR>   <BR>NOBODY'S FOOL this is the song when avril raps a bit but also sings. When she raps, the lyrics are really bad. And when she sings, in the chorus, its pretty good. fast beet. this song gives me a sense of strength and pride. I like it.<BR>   <BR>The next two songs, TOO MUCH TO ASK and NAKED have okay tunes but nothing really good about them.<BR>   <BR>OVERALL I GIVE THIS C.D.  4 1/2 STARS. I KNOW MY THING SAYS FOUR BUT THIS WRITING A REVIEW WON'T LET ME GIVE HALF STARS. Buy this c.d. its good.

B00000IAU3|5.0|As of 25th August 2002, No Angel has spent 97 consecutive weeks on the UK Album Chart. It has gone 9x platinum in the UK selling 2.4 million copies, selling a further 14 million worldwide. Dido deserves all this success but it's a shame it's all because of Eminem. Dido wrote or co-wrote every single song on the album. Each track is different in their mood and reflect unique times in her life. No Angel has won many awards and recieved great critical acclaim, so I decided to buy it. Here's my review of each song...<br />Track 1 is Here With Me (10/10). This was Dido's first single to be released and was a hit all over Europe where it made No.4 in the UK chart in February 2001. The smooth vocals of Dido are supplied with a soft undertone for the first chorus before breaking out into a powerful love song. Dido's vocals are perfect for the track. The lyrics are beautiful and thought-provoking. Track 2 is Hunter (10/10) was the third single to be taken from No Angel where it entered the UK Top 20 late in 2001. The guitar influenced and rocky bassline is supplied with poetic backing-vocals. Dido is never one to make a fuss about making a great video - but the video to Hunter is probably her best to date. Track 3 is Don't Think Of Me (10/10). This is one of my favourite un-released tracks on the album. I like the lyrics at the beginning of the song and the traditional Dido indie bassline (try saying that ten times fast!). The chorus is a full-on raging revenge-attack and this should've been released as a single. But the bit where Dido whispers doesn't suit her - it would've been better just left as an instrumental for 30 seconds or so - whispering on tracks is for sleazy Christina Aguilera. Track 4 is My Lover's Gone (10/10). This is a beautiful, haunting ballad and definetly one of the best on the album. I love the lyrics, \\"my lover's gone, his boots no longer by my door, he left at dawn, and as I slept I felt him go\\". I also like the lyrics, \\"my lover's gone, no earthly ships will ever bring him home...again\\". The instruments used are superb and haunting. For such a short track, it makes one hell of an impact. Track 5 is All You Want (10/10). A video was made for this but the song was never released as a single. This is another one of the best tracks on the album. The video is just a compilation of behind-the-scenes footage from tours and performances. The lyrics are yet again fabulous. Track 6 is Thank You (9/10). This was the second single to be released from this album in the summer of 2001 where it made No.3 in the UK and was a big hit all over Europe. This is the biggest Dido single to date because of the famous lyrics, \\"my tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all. The morning rain clouds up my window, and I can't see at all\\" which was sampled on Eminem's mammoth No.1 hit, Stan. The video is good but strange. Track 7 is Honestly OK (8/10). The instrumental at the beginning of this track is very good. The song itself is good, but not amazing like some of ther rest of the tracks on this album.<br />Track 8 is Slide (8/10). The lyrics on this song are great and interesting. It may tell a story about Dido's past. I like the swaying beats and soft undertone but this song passes along almost unnoticed... Track 9 is Isobel (8/10). I like the instruments on the beginning of this song but the song in itself is not very good. It seems to just sit there and make no effort to impress the listener. Track 10 is I'm No Angel (9/10). This is more like it! After the past three songs been pretty poor, this makes up for it. I'm No Angel is a standout track with a catchy bassline and cool vocals from Ms. Armstrong. Another great track. Track 11 is My Life (9/10). This moody ballad is slow and moving. Dido's voice is perfect to suit the song and the piano is great. I wish I could think of more to write about this song but I can't because it's no different to any of thre other songs on the album. Track 12 is Take My Hand (BONUS TRACK) (10/10). This is good...very good. I have the feeling the music was produced by Rollo of Faithless as she has a good connection with them. The funky, dance bassline sounds a lot like One Step Too Far from earlier this year. People who bought the first edition of No Angel should trade it for this special edition version as this song is brilliant - you have to have it.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />No Angel is a tricky album to describe. I feel that the first six tracks are pure brilliance and are the best on the album. But the quality seems to drop as the album progresses while suddenly getting better. I often repeat myself by saying \\"great lyrics\\" and, \\"perfect voice\\", but it's true. A lot of people who don't have this album will think I'm making it up, but people who do have this album will know I'm not. The presentation of the album is rather poor. I mean, couldn't she come up with something better than a picture of herself in the word 'Dido' and a grey background? The inlay of the CD is intersting. It has pictures of Dido as a girl, her family and pictures of her from the present.ACK) (10/10). This is good...very good. I have the feeling the music was produced by Rollo of Faithless as she has a good connection with them. The funky, dance bassline sounds a lot like One Step Too Far from earlier this year. People who bought the first edition of No Angel should trade it for this special edition version as this song is brilliant - you have to have it. <br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />No Angel is a tricky album to describe. I feel that the first six tracks are pure brilliance and are the best on the album. But the quality seems to drop as the album progresses while suddenly getting better. I often repeat myself by saying \\"great lyrics\\" and, \\"perfect voice\\", but it's true.

0316666343|4.0|Sebold's novel is one of the better ones I've read recently, along with Berg's True to form and The Secret LIfe of Bees (don't remember author's name! sorry!).  Recommended, particularly with the other two novels, for book groups.  I hope Sebold has more stories to tell. Its only flaw is perhaps the deus ex machina handling of the neighbor, but Sebold's metaphor of bones is more important, and so I overlook that.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a great blend of pop, rock, jazz, and even some blues.  If the music doesn't hook you the lyrics will.  Music that takes us from being lost in our world to being lost in love.  Lyrics that we can relate to, and melodies that paints us the picture.  If you haven't seen a live show...you are really missin' out.  I have all of my Metallica and metal head friends getting into the music and so will you.  So for all of those that are also having a quarter-life crisis.  I strongly recommend picking up this album.<br />There's always room for squares...
0345451325|5.0|When I saw this book come out I thought it was going to be bad. I have read books based off of other video games and most of them were a waste of a tree. The games themselves were good, just they didn't translate very well to a print format, or the author didn't have a clue as to the games feel or just couldn't write. This one is different. Actual plot and characters that weren't 2-D. Very well written and a must read if you like HALO for X-Box.
B00005MP58|5.0|Wow!! This is just a fabulous adaption of Pride and Prejiduce! The length is a little daunting when you first start out but you come to realize that the length is what makes it great. Unlike other films that have to skip or shorten scenes to fit the 2 hour format this movie doesn't cut any corners. This movie rarely strays from Jane Austen's book. And that is how it should be.  The witty talented Austen knew what she was doing. And it is wonderful to see a movie that acknowledges that. The characters both the main and the supporting are perfectly cast. Jennifer Ehle is the most fantastic Lizzy there could ever be. And colin firth is rather dashing as the misunderstood Mr. Darcy. Lizzy's parents and sisters are well represented as are the Bingleys and Mr. Colins absolutely steals the scene whenever he appears with his his ignorant humor. To top it all off the scenery is gorgeous (espacially Pemberly) and the sets seem to come right out of the book. It is best to watch the whole thing at once if you could set aside a Sunday afternoon. You won't be disappointed. As with the book itself I wish I could give this movie 1000 stars.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Before I watched this movie, I was prepared for an action-packed war drama.  Instead I was presented more with Robert Redford's fighting with CIA officials than the fast-paced action the previews lead you to believe fill the entire movie.  However, there is definite action in this movie, and overall it's not too gory.<br />In the end I was actually presently surprised with how good the movie ended up being.  It's not one of my favorite movies, but I'll definitely watch it on a lazy saturday afternoon with nothing else to do.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is sooo cute!  It reminds you of things you would do when you were a kid, things you wish you had the guts to do, and things you are glad hasn't happened to you.  A good movie for a small get together or a date.  It is a film that is easily understood by even the smallest of minds.
B00005JKED|5.0|Everything that you've heard about 'Training Day' is right.  Well, depending on what ya heard.  Does that make any sense?  If you heard that this is one of the strongest and most unflinchingly real movies to come out exploring the seedy underbelly of the police force as well as a film that brought Denzel Washington to new unexplored heights as an actor (an' ya probably diddn't think he could get any higher that he already was), then you heard right.  This is the film that re-established him as my personal favorite actor, as well as caused those stiffs at the Academy to finally throw down an' give him a damn Best Actor Oscar, after the years of hard work he's put in.  But at the same time, y'all folks needa recognize Ethan Hawke's contribution to the movie as well.<br />In this kind of film, where the lead character is a rogue and ruthless crooked cop with seemingly no morals or respect for anything, you HAVE to have somebody to keep the film steeped in the reality of the everyday Joe.  It's the only way that the film could be disturbing and effective, without alienating its audience.  Well, Ethan Hawke is that everyday Joe.  He's rookie cop Jake Hoyt, young, boyish, naive, new husband and father; he just wants what we all want, to take care of his family by working and doing whatever possible to make it into the high ranks of his profession.  If only he had known what that was going to involve.<br />It's become almost mandatory these days when making an urban film, that you HAVE to cast some hip-hop and R&B stars that want to try their hand at acting in small roles.  This film is no exception, and that is at times for the better and at times for the worse.  I tell ya I ain't even recognize Macy Gray until I heard that rough, sandpaper voice of her's, but she plays a nasty ol' hood rat, complete with a sassy attitude, some long fingernails and a mouth like a sailor.  She done impressed me though, I must say.  The parapalegic crack dealer is played by Snoop Dogg, whowas almost perfect in his role, but there had to be a rotten apple I guess, an' here that comes in the form of Dr. Dre.  He plays one of Alonzo's crooked narc troops, but he jus' don't got the acting skill at all.  His thick braids and constant scowl are almost laughable, an' just made him look more fake and unconvincing in the role.  Good thing he only has a few lines.<br />The director of this movie, a young man named Antoine Fuqua, has got a big, bright future ahead of him if this movie is any indication.  He seem to have a knack for creating a hypnotic and dreamlike quality in a film.  The way he opens the movie with the sun rising dissolving into Jake's alarm going off.  That whole first scene with Jake sitting up in bed and looking over at his wife who is feeding their baby in a rocking chair, the dark blue lighting, it's just surreal, almost as if Jake was still in a dream.  And in a sense, he is.  He's at home, cut off from the outside world, and in the dream that he's always had of a comfortable and easygoing life.  But, very soon he will be thrust into a hellish world he could have never imagined.<br />The best dialogue in the movie comes, not surprisingly, from Jake and Alonzo's conversations while they're riding around L.A. in the Monte Carlo.  Especially when they get really heated.  It's two almost TOTALLY different people that are struggling to relate to each other.  One who wants to be a good cop and make an honest paycheck, and one who wants to get the job done and get paid, by any means necessary.<br />This movie is not just your average crime drama or cop thriller, its a movie about morals, about decisions, about the treachory we accept as part of life and the corruption that we all seem to look the other way about.  How long would you be able to go on telling yourself that the ends justify the means, the deeper and darker you go?  I think that's the question Jake kept asking himself.  You can see it in his eyes, the uncertainty about what he agrees to go along with.  You would think he coulda got out of this predicament before he got too far in, but, damn, Alonzo can be one manipulative son of a gun.<br />Now I bought this DVD with a sticker on it that said 'Loaded with Special Features!'  Well, I was a little disappointed in that matter, because it's not really loaded.  The featurette is nothing really special, and is only about 15 minutes long.  The deleted scenes are definitely require watching material, because some of 'em are great and delve even deeper into both Alonzo and Jake.  The alternate ending is more like an extended ending, because it doesn't change anything about the outcome.  It's a quick, but I thought crucial, conversation and I personally think it shoulda been kept in the final cut.  It brought the story full-circle.<br />This movie is not for the squeamish or for the conservatives, because it sometimes does seem to be sending mixed messages, which is one of the reasons I think it was a mistake to not include that final conversation in the ending, because it really evened out the rough edges quite a bit.  Nevertheless, this is one of the best films of last year, featuring two of the best performances of last year, so don't hesitate to pick it up.
B00005J73X|4.0|The best way to hear Bon Jovi is live, no question about that, but it's not always possible (especially when they're not on tour).  One Wild Night is a good representation of what you can expect when you go to a Bon Jovi show, good hard rocking fun!
B000063S6Z|2.0|To me, Moby's 18 is the sound of a man trying to get more licensing contracts. He made a superb album with Play, and he managed to license every song on the album for use in movies, commercials, etc. And more power to him. It was a great album. Moby's always been changing in his sound, but it was no surprise to hear that once he was able to sell out big time, he stuck with the same sound he was using. Not that that's such a horrible thing. But some of these songs could pass for carbon copies of Play songs. We get similar-sounding field recordings of southerners singing &quot;Lordy, don't leave me all by myself.&quot; More than reminiscent of &quot;Oh Lordy, my trouble so hard&quot; from &quot;Natural Blues.&quot; &quot;Bodyrock&quot; gets done over as &quot;Jam For the Ladies.&quot; &quot;Extreme Ways&quot; sounds like &quot;South Side.&quot; It goes on. But it's not entirely the same. Moby seems to be going new age on us all, writing songs for Sinead O'Conner to sing over Enya-like sounds. Oy. The album seems like excercise. Boring. &quot;The Rafters&quot; is the only song that I really like, and even that one suffers from a seemingly patented Moby swelling synth-string treatment that was originally used so well in &quot;Porcelain,&quot; but now seems to pop up in every single one of his songs.<br />Oh, and let's not forget that as of right now, I know of at least three of the songs from the album are licensed, with more to come for sure. To teach a dog a new trick, you give him a treat. Well, Moby is sure desrving of his treat this time. He did his trick just as you hoped.

B000069HKH|5.0|I am not a die hard Bruce fan but I do occasionally buy his cds.  I happened to buy this one and the first time I played it I was amazedat how beautiful it was! So far I think it is the best album I have bought this year.  The band plays beautiful, great lyrics that tell beautiful stories of inspiration and hope.  Great harmonics by Bruce.  Most of the songs are inspired by 9/11 but even if they weren't I'd still love this cd all the more.  The only complaint I have is the art work & album cover is boring.  But the music is overall what counts and it is beautiful!
B00000IQB7|5.0|I liked this movie when it first came out, I like it now <BR>and my kids who are Star Wars , Lord of the Rings fans,<BR>like it too.<BR>Yes it's geeky and very 80's. But that was the audience, it was made for. Just take that into account because your not going to get Jurrassic Park and Fhantom Menace,special effects in this time frame. If they did this movie now with the effects of today it would knock your socks off. It's just fun escapism.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Forget about eating raw meat, just watch this movie. Based on Sony Playstation's terrifying game, a deadly virus has taken over Raccoon City and mostly everybody is dead. That's the plot, now the funnies. Michelle Rodriguez kicked some serious backside in this movie. While shooting zombies to Marilyn Manson music, the movie's action never stops. Watch commandos get sliced by lasers. Watch out! Hey, that one guy Eric Mabius looks like he's on something. Chica should've lived. Where was the mansion? Where was Chris and Jill? Instead we get &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; chick who should have kept her clothes on. Elevators are dangerous. Don't let people bite your hands. If they do, go to a doctor and say a zombie bit you. Don't trust man's best friend. Oh yeah, be sure to cook your meat, you don't want the runnies.
6301954947|4.0|Waterloo will certainly go down as a benchmark for how to film  jaw-droppingly good battle scenes, but don't forget the almost surprisingly good acting. After all, there's no fighting at all during the film's first half. Instead you get Rod Steiger almost chewing scenery as Napoleon, but still passionately communicating the personal doubts and nervous good cheer as the egomanical French dictator desperately faces his Waterloo. Christopher Plummer's Wellington is Napoleon's comic foil in the film, combining a comical arrogance with a supreme \\"stiff upper lip\\" confidence. His portrayal shows you how Wellington was never defeated in seven years of fighting the French because he refused to buy into the myth of Napoleon's overwhelming power. Even Orson Welles does a good job in what is essentially a cameo, giving us a Louis XVIII so ground down by years of watching the French mob kill those he loved that he has no fight left in him. We see that fat, reactionary Louis is wiser than Napoleon, the darling of the Enlightenment.<br />I don't know that Waterloo was pro-war, but what's surprising, considering it came out in 1971, was that it wasn't anti-war. This can probably be explained by the fact that it seemed to be an East European production. Ironically, while left-wing Western Europeans in 1971 were militantly pacifistic, their Warsaw Pact counterparts (who lived in communist societies that Western intellectuals supposedly envied) saw no problem with portraying war in neutral terms when fought for a good purpose. Besides, no one who watches as Wellington gloomily surveys the rows of corpses after the battle can say Waterloo hides that war is a sad, deadly business.<br />Finally, the music strikes the right combination of pride and melancholy. And the slow-motion battle scenes communicate a jarring surrealism that reminded me of what Speilberg did with Tom Hanks' character on the beach in Saving Private Ryan.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is their best album to date! I love the melodies, the pop catchy sounds and the singing rocks!  What more can I say..the cd is wonderful!  Not really as 'cutting edge' as their early stuff but really good music!
0786915749|5.0|The first novel of the Chronicles Trilogy and of Dragonlance itself is an amazing debut of magic, wonder, and excitement. This book is of course archtypical but then again its the novel that was losely based on Dungeons and Dragons. But to say its nothing but a roleplaying game book is selling it short. Dragons of Autumn Twilight has its errors in writing but the themes and points given in the story is well mature and thoughtful. The characters (who indeed are archtype like-the cleric, the half elf, the mage, etc) are very character driven, each individual and each likeable in their own way. Much of then novel is driven with expierences the reader can relate to such as self doubt, questioning, and hope. The novel is indeed a good vs. evil story but has factors such as divination, corruption in organized,religon-which is very real today, and extreme prejudices. This and many other factors deem Dragonlance to be unique and equaled to other brilliant books (LOTR, Shannara, WOT,etc). Also this novel brings about the debut of the very popular character Raistlin which if this novel alone was about just him you should still buy the book. Raistlin is indentifable due to his weak and frail nature,his looks, and the fact that he is hated because he is a mage but his ambition and his drive is intriguing. Without spoiling the novel, the story brings about an action-filled quest to discover the truth, the hardships of responsiblity, and what it means to have faith. Plus it has Dragons in it :). If you do not own or have read this novel than you MUST BUY THIS BOOK!
B00005JKLZ|1.0|H.G. Wells' classic novel has been brought to the big screen again, but by his great-grandson. The special effects are dazzling, but the movie moves slower than watching turtles fight. I must have dozed off during this movie because I got maybe five hours of sleep and it was still on when I woke up. Guy Pearce plays the professor who tried to save his girlfriend's life twice, but he went into the future instead to fight ugly things called Morlocks. Samantha Mumba doesn't sing, &quot;Baby Come On Over,&quot; but tries to sound intelligent instead. I felt like I was getting older watching this movie. Gray hair and all, I now use a cane to walk around. If you're looking for excitement, then rent a lordage movie. If you want to sleep like a rock, then watch this movie. Insomniacs pay attention!
B000021YQV|5.0|First of all, I'd just like to say that finds SOAD's lyricsc \\"mindless raving\\" are very much mistaking.  Some songs, like Jet Pilot, are bit lyrically obvious, but the rest pack some serious meaning.  Another thing I'd like to say is that some of my favorite bands are the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime and the smashing pumpkins so I really was not a metal fan until I heard SOAD.  There's nothing i hate more than [bad] lyrics.  Even if they're a bit stupid, the stupidity must be artful.  Bounce, for example, is actually about something not so thought provoking.  However, SOAD didn't do what so many rappers do and shove it down your throat with a broom handle.  They actually turned it into a METAPHOR.  You hear that Ludacris, \\"METAPHOR\\"! <BR>     Anyway, the concept is good, the instrumentals are good, and the ltrics are also exceptional.  Keep goin, SOAD!

B000063V8R|5.0|Star Trek: The Next Generation didn't really hit its stride until the middle of the third season. After the shaky first season and the short second season, in the third season we finally get to see some The Next Generation in all of its glory.<br />Unlike most of the 1st and 2nd season episodes, the third season took the time to explore more of the backround of the characters: <BR>1) Worf's backround was thoroughly explained in \\"SINS OF THE FATHER.\\" In that episode we meet his long lost brother and learn more about his true father. <BR>2) Another noted episode is \\"THE ENEMY,\\" where Geordi is stranded on a desolate planet with a Romulan. It's great to see the La Forge character actually do something besides speaking techno-babble. <BR>3) \\"THE OFFSPRING\\" was a great Data episode and \\"SAREK\\" showed that Patrick Stewart is a magnificent actor. <BR>(Keep in mind that there are also other character-driven episodes to watch that are also enjoyable.)<br />That aside, there were many action-packed episodes: <BR>1) In \\"THE HIGH GROUND,\\" the Enterprise must battle terrorists after they kidnap Dr. Crusher. A great scene is when the terrorists come aboard the Enterprise and try to hijack it by force so they can destory it. <BR>2)Another action-packed episode is \\"THE HUNTED,\\" which is about a genetically superior veteran of planetary war that comes aboard the Enterprise. The last 10 minutes of this episode are some of the best minutes I'sve ever seen in an TNG episode. <br />For comedy lovers, there are also some humurous episodes that let the crew lighten up for a few episodes:<BR>1) In \\"DEJA Q,\\" Q comes aboard the Enterprise with all of his powers lost, but no one belives him. The \\"going away present\\" that he gives to Data at the end is great.<BR>2) In \\"MENAGE A TROI,\\" Riker, Troi and her mother are captured by Ferengi. Troi's mother ends up giving \\"ear foreplay\\" to a Ferengi and Picard is forced to use his knowledge of poetry.<br />And finally, to the classic of the season, \\"THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, PART 1.\\" Just a little better than the second part, this episode is the best overall epsiode. It has great music, stellar acting, awesome special effects, some good action, and THE BEST ENDING EVER TO A TNG EPISODE. The last 7 minutes are outstanding. <br />Overall, the 3rd season of TNG isn't only a great one; it's the season that started TNG on its four-season greatness. (Seasons 3-6) Finally TNG has hit its stride. <br />1989-1990; Approx. 20 hours; All episodes are Rated PG for for brief language and mild violence.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|This is Camel's best studio album since they went independent in 1991.  While this album contains some classic Camel sound, there are also some pleasant surprises.  As always, there is a lot of great guitar playing by Andy Latimer. In addition, Andy plays more flute than usual on this album.  In places, the flute playing is reminiscent of Ian Anderson. The album also features Guy LeBlanc's fine keyboards.  Five of the seven songs are more than 7 minutes long, with the title track clocking in at more than 11 minutes. This album is not as melancholy as Camel's other recent albums.  In particular, &quot;Fox Hill&quot; is very upbeat. If you like melodic symphonic rock, you will like this album.
B00004TL2N|4.0|First, the bad news, which you have probably already heard:<BR>Boulez does not give you the majestic bowl-you-over power one often associates with Bruckner's music, especially when conducted by someone like von Karajan.  If you want to experience why this symphony is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Apocalyptic&quot;, this is not the recording for you.<BR>On the other hand, Boulez reads this score with sensitivity and attention to detail, which are well-brought-out in the crystal-clear sound of this recording.  The Vienna Philharmonic, as so often when playing Bruckner, is wonderful.<br />I like the somewhat faster tempos, not least of all because it enables the recording to fit on one disc.  I have always thought the first two movements did better when played at faster tempos; I almost never listened to the 2nd-4th movements of Giulini's great recording on DG with the VPO because I found his first movement so trying.  <br />That being said, I didn't find Boulez's first movement entirely satisfying; it *does* lose something when the climaxes are not performed with the accustomed Bruckner &quot;umph&quot;.  I liked the second movement a lot; &quot;deutscher Michel&quot; or no, I think it comes off better with Boulez's lighter-footed interpretation than most other performances I've heard.<br />I actually enjoyed the slow movement.  Boulez opens with a mood that is restrained and contemplative rather than brooding and tragic, then allows the emotion and profundity of this great movement to unfold naturally, rather than straining to drag greatness out of every bar.  In spite of the short timing (less than 25 minutes), the music did not sound rushed at all to me.<br />I run hot and cold on the Finale.  Again, it lacks the colossal power one hopes for in an epic Bruckner movement, but as Boulez takes this away with one hand, he gives you clarity construction and sensitivity to nuance on the other.<br />All in all, this recording is well worth getting if you think you'dlike to hear something different in Bruckner, or if you are a little put off by the sound and fury that so often plagues a typical performance of one of his symphonies.
B000001ESJ|5.0|I adore this album and not just for the music on it. I got this album for Christmas back in 1977 and was completely blown away by it! The title track gets the album off to a great start, with it's classical guitar solo, that's augmented by synthesizers.Tis a pleasant melody and it leads into the other part of the song, which has some mighty powerful guitar riffs and licks and some very solid and adventurous bass playing and a very exciting instrumental section and.... It's just a terrific song!<br /> \\"Xanadu\\" follows and it reminds me very much of the winter of 77-78. There was alot of snow that winter and me and one of my older brothers and one of our friends did alot of sledding.Twas a magical winter and A FAREWELL TO KINGS always brings me back to it.<br />\\"Closer To The Heart\\" really is a good progressive pop song, tho' like many RUSH fans I'm sick to death of it!<br />  \\"CYGNUS X-1\\" is also a terrific song and while it's a bit repetitive in spots, it's also a very powerful prog-metal song and has some fast and ferocious jamming in it, especially towards the end of it.<br />  \\"Madrigal\\" is a very lightweight and pleasant love song with some very sweet lyrics. \\"Cinderella Man\\" is probably my least favorite song on the album, even though I do like the instrumental section, which saw Rush flirting with disco!<br />\\"A Farewell To Kings\\" is also one of RUSH'S best SOUNDING albums and this album and \\"Hemispheres\\" saw RUSH at their progressive best! Tis no wonder I find \\"Vapor Trails\\" so disappointing!
630305904X|5.0|Sally Potter is one of the few directors to achieve the near impossible - to create a movie that actually surpasses the original novel.<br />Not wishing to take anything away from Virginia Woolf, whose The Waves is one of the most brilliant and defining novels of all time, Potter's film version is nothing less than a work of art.<br />As other reviewers have indicated, when the Orlando character, who was based on Woolf's friend and lover, Victoria (Vita) Sackville-West, crosses gender to become a woman, she automatically loses the right to own the very same property that, as a man, she/he had owned for eons. Even as a socio-political commentary, (see also Woolf's A Room Of One's Own) this speaks volumes about a patriarchal society in which the lowliest, most moronic male had infinitely more rights than the most brilliant and gifted female.<br />Our society is still dealing with the legacy of the tyranny of gender and the legacy of the Inquisition, in which nine million women were murdered for being women.<br />Yet despite the dark insanities that underly the film's pivotal transition, Potter's modern classic is a rich and joyful romp, filled with love, hope and transcendence, with a simply breathtakingly beautiful closing section.<br />A rare and inspired work of genius, in which the production direction and casting cannot be faulted.
B0000683DH|4.0|It's very rare that sequels are sometimes better than their original. Well I guess the bolder Star Trek II:the Wrath of Khan did it! This movie was much steadier, and a lot more uplifting than that the very endless yawner Star Trek the Motion Picture.

B000065U1N|5.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is an ultra-realistic, fact-based account of the incident which took place October 3 and 4, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia. An elite group of U.S. Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are assigned to infiltrate a Somalia town and capture two lieutenants and other tier one associates of Mohamed Farrah Aiddid, the despotic warlord responsible for the starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. When one of the U.S. Black Hawk choppers is shot down by a RPG, the by-the-book, 30-minute mission turns into a 15-hour struggle for survival as Aiddid's militia closes in.<br />No-nonsense and to the point, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is replete with stark images that evoke the frenzied horror of war, giving you the sense of being right in the middle of the fray. Director Ridley Scott weaves his craft masterfully, juxtaposing intense, graphic battles with visually stunning, cinematic scenes. His keen sense of detail is evident in little things like animals running across streets and soldiers brushing hot spent shell casings off their bodies. Scott did not do it alone, however. He is aided by convincing performances from a fine cast. Comparisons to another recent war film are inevitable. It features the same desaturated color and distinct shutter speed used for battle sequences seen in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". However, this film is even more effective. After all, it is a true story. Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it flushes political correctness down the toilet, depicting events as they actually happened. The only flaw is Hans Zimmer's annoying rock soundtrack, which diminishes the documentary quality of the film and makes a few scenes bare to close a resemblance to a music video or military recruitment commercial. The film would have had an even more realistic feel with minimal scoring or no scoring at all.<br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a tribute to the courage exhibited by the U.S. fighting forces and the 19 American soldiers who were killed that day in 1993. It also brings to the public's attention a little-known but important event. Regardless of the Motion Picture Academy's selection, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is the best film of the year.
B000002HJR|4.0|I don't know why I never heard of these guys before Down 2 came out. This CD, however, is better than that one. Out of all of Phil Anselmo's projects, this one is probably my least favorite. It's still great though. So that should tell you how great all his other bands are. (I haven't heard Christ Inversion yet so I don't know about them) &quot;Lifer&quot;, &quot;Pray For The Locust&quot;, &quot;Losing All&quot; and &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; are all awesome songs. This is more of a southern-blues metal (imagine that combination!). Phil sings almost all the way through on this band. Unfourtunately, you won't be able to hear the clear flawless singing you heard on &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot; and &quot;Vulgar Display&quot; before Phil roached his throat. But it still sounds almost as good. If you're gonna get one of these, get this one.
B000002GYR|5.0|I remember long ago lending &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot; from the library and while listening to it, I realised the music was really good, but I wasn't really up for it back then.  A few years ago I came across &quot;Closing Time&quot; in the store and decided to buy it.  It's pretty safe to say it changed and broadened much of my interest in music (which was allready pretty broad from Opera to Techno &amp; Rock).<br />Closing Time is not a concept album, the songs are all pretty much seperate, but somehow belong together.  If you like an album of Tom Waits that is more glued together I suggest &quot;NightHawks at the diner&quot; which is recorded live and captures Waits being funny and signing about the small things of everyday.  <br />The first track Ol' 55 is an earlier song which was covered by The Eagles before this album was realeased and is a perfect start for 11 more wonderful tracks.  Here, there aren't any flaws (except for maybe the downtempo Lonely, but it fits in well actually), every song is a beautiful masterpiece that makes you sing along and think about simple things in life which Tom Waits seems to enjoy most.  &quot;I hope that I don't fall in love with you&quot; is another remarkable song that sounds so very cliché, but Waits can make it all sound great.  My personal favourite (if one has to be picked) must be &quot;Grapefruit Moon&quot;, a song that might be about itself from my point of view (&quot;That every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside&quot;).<br />This CD will hopefully get you interested in Tom Waits, and moreover in the excellent music he makes.  It certainly worked for me.
B00005K3O4|5.0|the first time i saw this movie, i think it was 3 in the morning and i had just come in from a night of some serious partying, i was hooked. since then ive watched it at least 50xs. the acting is so bad it makes it good. i now have granchildren. the first time they watched it with me they were really scared. i thought they would think it was as bad as i did.i have finally purchased this movie, and plan to show it halloween night along with some other horror films it has become,one of my favorites
0385503954|1.0|On the recommendation of a friend and its literary reputation, I wasted two nights ploughing through the first 85 pages of this book and skimming another 20 before I gave up entirely. It had the &quot;literary&quot; quality of endlessly describing the unimportant - details which might be interesting if you cared about any of these people, but I did not. I agree, the first chapter was charming. But nothing after it gave me a single reason to want to waste more time with these characters and their torturous, petty, over-analyzed lives.
B000069KE0|2.0|Still WAAAAYYY Too Much HISS on this Remastered CD..Just not as much as on the Original 2 CD Columbia Release or the Subsequent 1 Cd Release on Columbia or Chicago Records.You would be better off buying an Original Reel To Reel or Find a Sealed LP on EBAY or music Store and Burning it yourself. These other &quot;Raters&quot; must be &quot;Homers&quot; and say anything is great that gets put out on their band. As A Chicago Fan since 1970 I was Highly anticipating this &quot;Cleaned&quot; up Release and Was Thoroughly Disappointed. Even the Japanese CHICAGO 2 CD is Horrific.
B00005JL3A|3.0|Resident Evil is not a horror film. It is a zombie flick. And it is based on the intriguing idea behind a video game.<br />With this in mind, I rented the movie with my best friend. After hours of having sat behind my boyfriend in boredom while he played Resident Evil on Dreamcast, I wasn't expecting much. However, as several other reviewers have said, this was a welcome surprise.<br />Milla Jovovich is more than adequate as a heroine, and the plot thickens as is appropriate for an action flick. What works in the movie's favor is that it actually feels like a video game. There is atmosphere and pressure, thumping climactic music, zero character development, dialogue pared down to the essentials, lots of shooting, lots of action, lots of locations, lots of zombies... all the comforts of Playstation, without having to move your thumb!<br />What genuinely moved me was the direction of this movie. The truly artful aspects of cinematography, sound, music, atmosphere, mist, slow pans... everything contributed to the sensory experience. Nice job. It's not Mozart, but it'll do. Break out the popcorn.
B00005QDW1|3.0|I'm opt to listening to all different types of music(although I'm mainly in the grunge and rcok/pop music along the lines of Hole,Nirvana,Babes In Toyland,Veruca Salt,REM,Michal Towber,The Distillers,Letters To Cleo,Black Crowes etc.)but when my brother brought home &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and I heard the song &quot;Sixteen&quot; I knew I fell in love with these guys.The ska punk mixed with the wiry sounds of funky guitar playing,most of No Doubts albums were a good comilation of catchy,yet meanigful lyrics mixed with the sweet polished sound of ska.Now,Rock Steady was none of these.I feel like,when a band changes they either change for the better or the worse,there's no inbetween.Now,No Doubt did it for the worse,I respect that they wanted to try somthing different,but now they're just doing it for the glamness of Reggae and dancehall.About the only song that kept my attention was 'Underneath It All' as it was a delicious little number with heart felt lyrics about being beautiful underneath all the matierialistic things we own.They could've done without the rap number by Lady Saw as it added basically NOTHING to the song,a melodic guitar solo would've worked better.Otherwise,this album only proved No Doubt had gone from the heart felt lyrics on TK and ROS,to trying to be 'Hella Good' on this album.If you like dancehall and are in the mood for simple lyrics rather that exploring your moody side,I reccomend this,but not for those who miss the days of BSC and the self titled album.
0553583182|4.0|This book was very interesting.  Since I've read it, I have been doing the self-talk and the affirmations, and it really works. If you surround yourself with postive thoughts, it creates positive energy and that is what this book is about.<br />How many people do you know that seem to attract bad luck or other negative people? It is almost like a vicous circle, bad things happen, you have negative thoughts in your mind, and more bad things happen.  This book will give you the tools to break that circle, use your mind and power of thought to turn things around.<br />We have the power to make our lives a fulfilling and wonderful journey, by just using your mind and thoughts to get there, and if you read this book, you can find your way.
B00005YUPO|4.0|I'll agree with many of the reviews here that this doesn't approach the magic that was achieved on Baby Mozart.  It does not grab our daughter's attention, nor hold our daughter's attention, quite like Baby Mozart does.<br />That said, it is still a nice video and does offer a nice alternative to Baby Mozart.  Our girl can get a bit bored with it, look down and begin playing with something, and then have a certain scene pop up that she enjoys and she'll be drawn back to watching it for a short period.<br />Some folks have complained a bit about Julie Aigner-Clark putting her kids in the video.  Well, to be honest, I actually like them in it.  I think most babies enjoy looking at other babies and children, and whenever they pop on the screen, my girl tends to drop what she is doing and watch them.  So I can forgive Aigner-Clark's seeming indulgence.  Hey, these videos are for your baby, not you, and babies don't care whose kids are in the video...they like watching them!<br />The other features of the DVD are nothing special.  My guess is they are rarely used (though I did do the reading feature with my 9-month old the other day, and she was somewhat transfixed with the images even if she is clueless about the words being said).<br />I'd recommend the DVD as it has continuous play capability.  No need to suffer through that pesky VHS re-wind!
B00000JBFW|5.0|Everyone seemed to be thrilled with Deep Purple MK II getting back together in '84. I knew this new record would be great...and it is...but the band was not so great. The guys just couldn't get the old unity back. John Lord was in Whitesnake when he came back to record this album. Ian Gillan had his own band and was fresh off a stint in Sabbath. Roger Glover was an esteemed producer, Ritche had his own legendary band, Rainbow. Ian Paice had played in a number of projects, including Whitesnake. The tension could be cut like a knife. Deep Purple, being the gods they are, just couldn't put out anything less then a classic. This record is another legendary record in Purple's history. I think this rates with &quot;In Rock&quot; and their greatest(not to mention THE greatest)record ever, &quot;Machine Head&quot;. If you want to know Deep Purple, this is a must.
0517118297|5.0|Jane Austen lovers might want to order a used copy of one of the out-of-print editions instead of this one, which appears to contain some errors, missing dialogue and so on.  That said, it's handy to have all of Austen's exquisite writing in one volume.  This marvelously articulate woman wrote with with razor-sharp perception, and the emotional states of her characters are fully detailed and examined.  The reader will have to pay attention constantly while reading, or s/he will miss the richness of description, and maybe even some necessary subtle plot lines.  These novels are meant to be read slowly and carefully, and savoured.  Austen may be an acquired taste, but once you appreciate her, you will be hooked for life.  I rarely re-read anything, but her works stand up to re-reading.
B00005OWEG|1.0|The original cut of this film is one of the most beautiful, and disturbing, pieces of cinema ever made.  The film flows so effortlessly, one would wonder why Coppola would want to go back and tinker with his finest accomplishment.  The only reason I can think of is money: people will buy the re-cut version.<br />However, the added scenes do nothing to forward the story, nor do they add to the disturbing atmosphere.  In fact, they take away from the film's power.  The flow is now choppy, the mood is broken by little bits of meaningless footage that deservedly belonged on the cutting room floor.<br />Consider the \\"napalm in the morning\\" scene with Duke.  How powerful that scene was in the original film.  Duke says, \\"Someday this war is gonna end.\\"  And then he walks off.  End of scene.  We are left with the ambiguity of Duke's - and the war's - morality.  He wants the war to end, but he doesn't.<br />The \\"director's cut\\" of this scene doesn't end here - it continues with an argument about Lance surfing, with Duke and Sheen's character arguing about the safety of this (didn't they do this earlier?): Duke yelling at them through a bullhorn.  Lance and Sheen then steal a surfboard, and the last shot we have of Duke is throwing the bullhorn in the air in anger.  His character is effectively stripped of its duality, the power of the \\"Someday this war's gonna end\\" statement left in the sand.<br />Then, as the boat pulls away, Sheen is laughing.  Sorry, Frances, it doesn't work.  (What happened to the surfboard?)<br />And what is the purpose of the sex scene with the bunnies?  It adds nothing to the forward momentum of the plot, and it deserved to stay on the cutting room floor.  (Unless, of course, you're after the thrill of some nice boobies.)<br />This version weakens the film considerably.  I give it one star because of this.  Avoid this one, or at least rent it and see for yourself.  I'll stick with the 1979 cut, thanks - it's a far superior film.
B00006690G|5.0|This C.D. is one of the best C.D.'s I have listen to in a long time.  Although there are explicit lyrics, the overall content and production of the C.D. is outstanding.  The songs seem to have \\"political\\" meanings.  This C.D. is BETTER than the Marshall Mathers LP!  The best thing about this C.D. is that it is also available in the \\"clean\\" version.  I recommend this C.D. to anyone!
078062565X|5.0|When film lovers discuss the merits of KING KONG, they often focus on the 'big' scenes, Kong on the Empire State Building, Kong bursting out of his shackles on stage in New York, Kong battling a series of prehistoric beasts on Skull Island.  KING KONG surely is deservedly known for these, but the movie's enduring power to enthrall each new generation of viewer is based on the movie's more subtle, yet equally mesmerizing lesser scenes, not all of which involve him.  What is astounding to a generation of contemporary audiences jaded by computer enhanced special effects is the way the movie has held up over the decades.  The stop-motion animation of Willis O'Brien shows a Kong as seamless as any computer could project today, and certainly as far superior to the 1976 King that groped Jessica Lange.  One of the reasons that this more recent Kong failed to resonate with modern audiences is that the somber, brooding mood of the original was reflected in the gauzy, hazy photography that showed the jungle of Skull Island to be every bit the Jurassic danger that Spielberg envisioned for his theme park. Repeated viewings of the sailors that slug their way through the jungle to find Ann Darrow emphasize the lurking monsters behind every tree and hill.  Directors Schoesdsack and Cooper (both of whom had bit parts as the pilot and machine gunner who shot Kong off the Empire State Building) would introduce each succeeding reptilian threat from a distance, almost lulling the sailors and the audience into a false security that the beast was not a threat.  But then, they would focus the camera on a twitch of the beast's head.  One could see and hear the beast sniff the air as a preparation to attack.  When it did attack, the assault came on like a runaway train.  Sometimes the guns of the sailors killed or drove it away, and sometimes they didn't.  It is this constant sense of menace that permeates Skull Island that serves as a prelude to meeting the King himself.  The sailors and natives saw Kong first, of course, when he grabbed Ann Darrow, but they had to experience the power of those outsized simian thews as Kong rolled them off the log into an unknown, dank horror below.  As many scenes of subtle, psychological power as there are on Skull Island there are an equal number in New York, a city which contains more deadly dragonflies than his home stomping grounds.  As one sees Kong rage over his abducted girlfriend both on Skull Island and in New York, one can see that Kong is not much more different from any guy who sees another dude swipe her.  His reaction each time is predictably violent.  As his violence increases, so does his ability to think rationally decrease.  Kong is a beast, sure, but he is a thinking, rational one who in the parlance of lawyers seeking to explain the murderous behavior of their clients, has 'lost it' since he was pushed beyond the limits of simian endurance.  But what elevates Kong beyond his more human killer counterparts is his inner sense of inherent nobility that comes out at crucial moments.  There is no doubt that he is a self-sacrificing creature who would unhesitatingly lay down his life for his mate.  He proves that on Skull Island and on the Empire State Building.  When Kong lays Ann down to face the swirling attack planes, he meets them as one king to another.  He beats his chest, roaring out his defiance, knowing full well that the power that overwhelmed the prehistoric beasts on Skull Island would fail him here.  For that brief moment, Kong transcends a beast out of his element.  The audience applauds a creature who in years to come would morph into John Wayne, Rocky, and every other hero worshipped by audiences in the theater with every bit of the fervor worshipped by the natives behind their huge wooden gate.  Kong was the king in every sense of the word in both his island in the Pacific and the island off the Atlantic.
B000000OQF|5.0|In the 1980s pop-metal was dominant and everybody loved Bon Jovi and Def Leppard...except for die-hard metal fans.  Then all of a sudden, Guns N' Roses came along bringing back hard, loud, angry rock n' roll to the mainstream.  Guns N' Roses music appealed to both pop-metal fans and true metal fans.  The result: the fastest selling debut album of all time.<br />Guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin establish themselves as riff gods on this album. The two played dueling guitar in every song. Although Stradlin was the group's best songwriter, Slash played all the memorable riffs, such as the classic opening to the SWEET CHILD O' MINE. <br />What's to say about Axl Rose? The guy was one half Mick Jaggar and one half Robert Plant. This guy hits notes so high you would think he got hit in the crouch one too many times. Not that it's a bad thing. The songs sound great because of his primal screaming. In songs like IT'S SO EASY and MR.  BROWNSTONE, Axl sings much lower; it sounds almost like a different singer. <br />This album is a classic for its contrasting feeling and attitude. The songs switch between pure rage (IT'S SO EASY, WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, OUT TA GET ME) and pure emotion (THINK ABOUT YOU, SWEET CHILD O' MINE). Even without the lyrics you can hear a distinct difference in tone.<br />Ultimately, the Guns N' Roses never put out anything as good as APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION again.  Just buy it. It's worth having in any classic rock/hard rock/heavy metal collection.
B000002JSN|4.0|Some people deem that PHYSICAL GRAFFITI is not the best LZ album because the sound is slightly different from that of the first four records - which are supposed to be the most representative. I can understand that. But think about this: while DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is certainly more \\"classic\\" Floyd than THE WALL - is it better? Twenty years later, the question is still open.<br />This is the paradox of PHYSICAL GRAFFITI: it is not the best example of the legendary Led Zep's sound, but it may be the band's most accomplished work. Indeed, although the album contains the usual rock highlights (\\"Custard pie\\", \\"The rover\\", \\"The Wanton song\\", \\"Sick again\\"), the band obviously wished to push other songs forward: \\"In my time of dying\\", \\"Kashmir\\", \\"In the light\\". These three songs are the longest and they benefit from meticulous arrangements, which is not the case of the rest. Besides, these songs were the ones that the band chose to play on stage during the 1975 tour (with \\"Trampled underfoot\\").<br />\\"Kashmir\\" may appear a little pompous to many, but I find it cool because it sounds like a James Bond score (that is not pejorative). \\"Trampled underfoot\\" is a good funky tune: I don't know many people who can listen to JPJ's harpsichord without tapping their foot. And if you listen to it with your girlfriend (or your boyfriend), it will probably give you some interesting ideas. \\"Bron yr Aur\\" is typically the kind of song which makes you run to the guitar shop.<br />But my favorite is definitely \\"In my time of dying\\" - the perfect example of musical symbiosis. On that one, there are no leaders and no followers: Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham are all at the same level, and they are at the top.<br />So why do I give 4 stars instead of 5? Because the second disc contains some fillers (\\"Boogie with stu\\", \\"Down by the seaside\\") which somehow dilute the spirit of the album. Another problem is that some of the songs sound like cast-offs from the HOUSES OF THE HOLY sessions. They are not bad, but they simply don't fit in. In short, PHYSICAL GRAFFITI is a very good double album, but it could have been an EXCELLENT single album.<br />Although it is not \\"classical\\" Zep, I strongly recommend PHYSICAL GRAFFITI to the people who want to discover LZ. It is a good synthesis of the heavy rock albums (I, II, IV, PRESENCE)and of the more experimental ones (III, HOUSES OF THE HOLY, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR). It is also the last album in which the cohesion between the members is undisputable.
B000000H7I|5.0|This CD has to be one of the greatest death metal records ever unleashed. Extremely technical and brutal all the way through. Guitar distortion is raw and violent and gives the CD a great feel. Frank Mullen delivers crushing, pulverizing vocals. Drumwork complements the riffs very well, and surprisingly for 1991 production at the time, the bass drum is AWESOME! In my opinion, the best Suffocation album of all time, even better than their 1995 release, \\"Pierced From Within\\". Definately a bone-crunching, genre-defining, most-own-it release. WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME!!!

You surely gonna love this,, there has been only one band which can match the excitement of a G'n'R live show,,and that is G'n'R itself,,don't miss out on thisssssss,,,this is something to cherish for long,
B00005T30L|4.0|I first saw \\"Ghost World\\" the 2nd semester of my senior year of high school.  To be honest, I didn't really pay attention to the whole movie.  I thought that these girls were so bitter, condescending and unlikable. That was my verdict until I re-rented it after I graduated from high school.    Many things had happened since I graduated from high school.  I lost my connection with some of my best friends and was alone for a long time, being subtly pressured into doing what my parents were suggesting about college and life.  With all of this happening, \\"Ghost World\\" played on my television and this time I paid attention.      I'm glad that I did.    The story focuses on two teenage girls just graduated from high school.  They're outcasts, and have caustic attitudes about almost everything in their lives.  Enid is the cynical, cutting, witty anti-heroine of this \\"Ghost World.\\"  Rebecca is her droll counterpart.  They do almost everything together from pestering their friend Josh (Brad Renfro), following people who look like \\"Satanists,\\" and patronizing Al the waiter at the local Wowsville, an \\"authentic\\" chain of 50's diners. One day they decide to play a trick on Seymour, a \\"loser\\" guy who places a personals ad in the newspaper.    As the summer progresses, they grow up and apart as Rebecca acquires a job and an apartment whilst Enid becomes friends with Seymour, whom she bonds with because Seymour like herself can't relate to \\"99.9% of humanity.\\"  As the real world looms closer for Enid she is left with two alternatives: succumb to the \\"Ghost World,\\" or be an individual like Seymour and be miserable because of it.    This movie is great for two reasons: 1. It contains 3-dimensional teenagers who think about other things besides prom. 2. It's a subtle historic portrait of Anytown, USA where corporations are slowly dulling the rich culture that once defined these towns.    Terry Zwigoff did a great job with this film.  Thora Birch is on target as Enid.  She's never showy with her performance.  She captures the contradictions of Enid, a young woman who despises the mainstream lifestyle, but isn't quite sure of what kind of lifestyle she wants for herself.  Scarlett Johansenn (I think that's how you spell it) is so funny as Rebecca.  She's so droll that you expect her to fall asleep at any moment.  Steve Buscemi is always great.  The scene in the bar with Seymour and the woman who likes Blues Hammer is heartbreakingly funny.     A great film with biting humor and vulnerability.
B00005RYLE|4.0|SO MANY ARE TURNED OFF BY THE HUMOR IN THE EVIL DEAD SERIES. I DUNNO WHY? I LOVE BEING HIT IN THE FUNNY BONE, WHILE BEING GROSS'D OUT AT THE SAME TIME. ALSO MANY ARE TURNED OFF BY HOW DATED IT LOOKS. COME ON, YOU HAVE TO RESPECT DIRECTOR SAM RAIMI FOR COMING UP WITH SO MUCH WITH SO LITTLE BUDGET WISE. FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT HAVE THESE PROBLEMS YOU SHOULD STICK TO THE BIG BUDGET MOVIES LIKE 'WATERWORLD', AND MORE RECENT DISASTERS LIKE 'BAD COMPANY', 'MEN IN BLACK II', AND 'REIGN OF FIRE'. LEAVE THEM GREAT DATED MOVIES LIKE 'EVIL DEAD' 'SUSPURIA', 'BAD TASTE' AND 'DAWN OF THE DEAD' FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME. EVIL DEAD SPAWNED TWO SEQUELS 'EVIL DEAD II' AND 'ARMY OF DARKNESS'. THE DEAD SERIES IS A MUST FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HUMOR MIXED WITH THEIR GORE.

B00000K19E|5.0|I, like most people I know, really loved the Matrix in the theatre, so its no surprise that I bought the DVD as soon as it came out.<br />This is one of the best DVDs I own.  The extra features are a great added value.  There are even a few games you can play if you have DVD capability on your computer.
B000002WYT|5.0|This CD has some of the greatest pop songs that the 90's ever created. Add that with Dave Matthews great songwriting, and you have a great mix.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Gettysburg is by far probably the best Civil War movie ever made.  I can't think a movie more quoted by fans of the Civil War and also a movie watched over and over again.  Historically this movie follows a majority of the events at Gettysburg but fails to cover everything that happened at Gettysburg such as the Wheatfield battle, Cavalry battles and Culp's Hill.  It is simply a movie based off of the book Killer Angels by Shaara.  The host of famous actors in this movie and the filming is spectactular.  Yes, this movie doesn't cover it all, but it is based from a fictional book that doesn't cover it all.  Simply this movie has done quite a bit for educating people about the Civil War and also brought about more interest.  It is a mainstay or &quot;must have&quot; for anyone who is interested in the Civil War.
B00005OAIE|5.0|At first listen, you may think that John Mayer's album,\\"Room For Squares\\", is just another pop record by just some guy that just wants to make money. But if you really take a listen, you will discover that he is one of the greatest new singer-songwriters around now, and that he is well mentally beyond his years. I HIGHLY!!! recommend this album to ANY real music fan.
019431510X|5.0|In my view, it is the best dictionary for nonnative speakers of English (British or US) available. Definitions are using simple  and easy to understand language, pronunciation is in IPA. It is full of illustrations, usage notes, etc. <br />The only thing I would like to have added is ethymology of (some) words. I mean simplified and non-scientific, just to help you to learn the word, esp. if you know some other languages like French, German, Spanish or Latin; or more common words in English.
6304806442|3.0|This movie is about spoiled british young men, and throughout the movie the appeal is that it's OK to be irresponsible if you are young, because at some point you will magically be able to choose &quot;going straight&quot;, and choose a life like &quot;me&quot;, and grin and lead a successful life.<br />It would be horrible for the society if teenagers watch this and regard Renton as their role model, without realizing that this kind of &quot;success story&quot; is only possible in movie. and if your parents are so rich that you can play through your life.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is the most important, and the most relevant, CD in the past 10 years or longer. This album illustrates everything rock 'n' roll can be. It's timely, topical and just plain good. Despite all that's happened in the past year, it's impossible to listen to this and not feel inspired. More important, Bruce at age 52 has done something no other rocker has done at a similar age; he's put together a true classic, one for the ages. Dylan hasn't been relevant in years. Mick and Keith's forays into the studio have descended into exercises in tonal breath control. Roger and Pete are merely cashing in. Perhaps Neil Young could do it (but he hasn't). It's funny that for the past few years Bruce has been trying to be Woody Guthrie, and everyone wants to be like their heroes, but Bruce scores big simply by being himself.
B00005QFE5|5.0|Luo Yusheng is returning home to bury his father who has just passed away.  When he returns home he finds out that his father's body is in a different city and his mother insists on having his fathers body carried home by hand according to old traditions.  This seems to be a very hard task, since it is winter and there are no other young people to help him in the village.  However, the mother's demand is easily understood, since he knows the story behind the passionate love she has for her late husband. The Road Home is a very intimate film about understanding, love, and compassion.  As the film fades out, it leaves the silver screen with a memory of a remarkable cinematic experience.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie was one of the better superhero movie.  Unlike Batman, there was some light behind the superhero.  There is great acting (Tobey Maguire as Parker and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin).  There wasn't a minute where you doubted either character.  There were also some really good cameos - Ted Raimi as Hoffman, Bruce Campbell as The Ring Announcer, Lucy Lawless as some random interviewie, and Stan Lee (he's in a crowd of people when the Green Goblin attacks at the festival).  It also stars Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, J.K. Simmons, Rosemary Harris, Gerry Becker, Bill Nunn, Jack Betts, Stanley Anderson, and Ron Perkins.  An excellent movie - two thumbs up!  WAY UP!!!
B000063DI8|3.0|No Prayer for the Dying marks the beginning of Iron Maiden's decline. Many theories have been proposed as to why metal's top band sunk into such a slump. Was it Adrian Smith's exit? Janick Ger's entrance? Or just an overall case of poor songwriting and uninspired ideas? I'll go for the latter.<br />In the wake of two monumental albums, fresh with a new vision and experimentation, Maiden decided to return to it's leather n' denim roots on No Prayer, shunning much of Seventh Son's lush synth soundscapes for stripped down song structures. No Prayer is the black sheep of Iron Maiden records, for it has no identity. Depending on how you listen, No Prayer is either Seventh Son Sr. (Fates Warning, Public Enema #1), or Fear of the Dark Jr. (The Assassin, Run Silent Run Deep). Many of Maiden's trademarks (sprawling epics, air raid siren vocals, and chugging basslines) are missing.<br />Tailgunner has the feel of something from Powerslave, but not the drive. No Prayer seems forced and often suffocates itself by not allowing breathing space for promising musical moments... (the Assassin)<br />However, a string of inspired, if drab tunes: No Prayer for the Dying, Public Enema #1 (personal favorite) and Fates Warning stands out as somewhat memorable, rescuing No Prayer from obscurity. Moments of brilliance during Run Silent.. and Mother Russia leave a Maiden fan thinking \\"what could of been...\\".<br />If yer a Maiden fanatic, get it. Otherwise, spend your money on Brave New World or the first seven.
1558908323|1.0|Mimic is a giant bug ovie that is neither entertaining nor scary, featuring characters we couldn't care in the least about. The only reason to see Mimic is because of good monster design and effects.
B000065U1N|1.0|First this movie fails to give me the reality of what happened. I am into some war movies and this was not a good one. It drugged on and on and on and I had to make myself watch it after turning it off so many times. This is a real downer- you are better of watching Full Metal Jacket.<br />Second, this movie act as if no other minorities fought. I was disappointed to see only a few minorities. Always making it about white men dying...whatabout the rest.<br />RENT THIS MOVIE. Then again, you may want to wait until it is on a rack for $$$- then again you may just want to save your money.
0201633612|5.0|From all other people's reviews, you have already known this is the classic text on the subject of design patterns. This is indisputable so I don't need to waste time trying to prove it again. <br />However, I would like to say something to those readers who are totally new to design patterns and C++/Smalltalk -- please do not be intimidated by the seemingly terse, dry and difficult style of this book. Since I myself am new to the world of design patterns, I would like to share with you my own experience and hope you can make a better decision when you pick your design patterns book.<br />&quot;Design Patterns&quot; is the classic text; its style is academic-oriented, rigorous, and terse. Unlike most popular computer books, you will find reading this book takes a lot of thinking, for each paragraph or even each sentence. Most examples used in this book are adapted from real world systems popular many years ago, so you will likely find you're not familiar with them at all. Moreover, some examples are related to GUI programming, so if you're mainly programming for backend, you will probably feel it's tough to understand some of the examples. Most code example in the book is written in C++ (some in Smalltalk.) If you're a Java programmer and have limited knowledge in C++, it might  take you some time to guess what certain C++ syntax means.<br />These all seem to be negative comment, but my conclusion is to the contrary -- this is the BEST book in the area, and you should read it despite of all the issues I mentioned above. I started my design pattern learning by using a couple of other books, such as &quot;Java Design Patterns: A Tutorial&quot;, &quot;Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented Design&quot;, and &quot;Applied Java Patterns&quot;. I chose these books mainly because they seem to be much easier to understand than &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. However, after spending time in these alternative books, I found none of them offers the accuracy and depth as &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. Often, after I read a chapter of the &quot;easy&quot; book, I feel I am still kind of lost. I seem to have understood the pattern I just learned, but then I feel it's not quite so. I guess I only learned the pattern in a superficial way, with little depth, and without being part of &quot;big picture.&quot; Later, I turned to the classic, &quot;Design Patterns&quot;. I forced myself to sit down and try to understand the authors' terse and rigorous writing and their unfamiliar examples. Gradually I found I was getting used to the style and the examples, and I actually started to learn much more from this book than from others. After reading half-way through the book, I felt the rigorous style is actually a big plus for this book, because I can get more accurate and in-depth information.<br />Therefore, I strongly suggest that you buy and read this book, even if you feel it's difficult to read. Your effort will pay off eventually. Use other books as reference only.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This movie is just plain old fun.  Nothing too deep or serious to weight it down, you just enjoy it from start to finish.
B000002ADT|5.0|I usually only write reviews for CD's I think are overlooked by the masses, but shouldn't be. This one perhaps is beginning to suffer from being overpraised. It is beautiful, mellow, warm, worth owning, essential. Still, of the 20 jazz CD's I own, there are at least five I like even more than this, and will play more often. Music hits you in the heart, and the memory, and one's tastes change as one enjoys/endures life. Right now, I like \\"Trane's Blues\\" and \\"Thelonious Monk/Sonny Rollins\\" even more than \\"Kind of Blue\\", even though it is great. If you have a limited music budget, as I do, sometimes your enjoyment varies with the price you paid...I have a lot of discs that I love because I got them for [money] or less, and several that I don't like much because I paid [money] for them. Does anyone else feel that way about their music? If you can afford \\"Kind of Blue\\" please buy it because it is excellent...but nobody can claim the title of best jazz album ever made. There are dozens, if not scores of candidates. This is a valid contender, but not the unanimous champ. Check out the two other discs I mentioned...no 300 reviews on file, but performances and emotional impact at least equal to \\"Kind of Blue.\\"
0783225733|5.0|I have a simple rule.  If a movie based on actual events, and which you already know the outcome, can still keep you on the edge of your seat, then it is phenomenal.  This is the case with Apollo 13.  You will be cheering at the end.  Wonderful job by Ron Howard, as usual.

Butterfly- Its alright i guess.<br />Well, You need to catch Kylie's Fever because it is one of the best CD's of the year to me!<br />...
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is an especially brillant edition of one of the cinematic masterpieces of our time. The digital transfer is excellent and the added features alone are worth the price. I'd have given the movie 6 stars if I could. If you've never seen this David Lean epic you're in for a major treat. One caveat: the bigger your TV screen the more you will enjoy it.

6300267881|5.0|I love the Exorcist. Pure horror. There is no film scarier. The Directors cut is even better, but they need to have the scene were the old priest dies, so we can see what really happened to him. Buy this one and the VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN as well. This is and always will be the best. Watch the film with 0 expectations and with the lights off, by yourself, and see what I'm talking about.

B00003CXTG|5.0|Director Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer made an amazing film.Althought it might seem a little long but it's a great movie.Well it's a great film and I recommend this to anyone who loves Josh Hartnett,Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale.Yes,the rest of the cast was amazing too! But these three people light up the screen!! I think this film attracts young people instead of older. And at the begining of the film you can just tell that this movie might make you cry.But other wise its a great film!
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Eight years ago I spent about 48 hours being delusional.  Frightening, dangerous delusions of paranoia.  Giddy, distorted delusions of grandeur.  I was an undiagnosed victim of manic depression, you see.  When people ask what it was like for me, I now say  &quot;See  'A Beautiful Mind'.&quot;  <BR>Besides, I can't get enough of Mr. Crowe in a tight white tee-shirt.<BR>This DVD is being sold in both full frame and wide screen formats.  Be careful to look closely at the cover, lest you purchase the wrong type.  You see, you can't get both;  it's either one or the other.  <BR>Thank God for Ron Howard for bringing to a wide audience this story of someone who deals with mental illness with courage, tenacity, humor, and humanity.  Thank God for people like John and Alicia Nash.<BR>With empowering stories like this, the shameful stigma shrinks.<BR>By the way, anyone who complains that the biographical info in this film is incomplete should simply read the book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar.  After all, no one wants to watch  &quot;Amadeus&quot;  in order to discern what Mozart's favorite color was and no one wants to watch  &quot;Shine&quot;  to find out whether David Helfgott prefers boxers or briefs!  (Lighten up y'all;  it's a MOVIE.  And if Akiva Goldsmith included every last detail in the screenplay, well, we'd have numb posteriors by fade-out!) :)
B000001E8S|4.0|I am a huge U2 fan, and I am openminded. What makes them my favorite band is their flare for experimentation and change. I bought this album because this was U2. However, I didn't expect a classic U2 album or anything close. If one has this mindset they will actually be pleasantly suprised.  The appreciation grows.  While the sound is for the most part not U2, it is in there.<br />There are hints of U2 though with the best examples being \\"Slug\\" and \\"Miss Sarajevo\\". Both tracks are wonderful as U2 songs and the later includes a great performance by Luciano Pavarotti (The single is really great too). Most of the album screams of Brian Eno, which is fine. If anything, this album exposes U2 fans to the ambient music of Eno. A few other worthy remarks are that this album actually includes vocals by Adam Clayton, \\"Your Blue Room\\", and a kind of rap by Bono on \\"Elvis Ate America\\", which is not the greatest track, but good for a chuckle or two.<br />Last of all, don't expect to find any of these songs in a movie, except Always, Forever, Now, which made it into a movie after the album. However, you can have fun reading the made up movie descriptions and realizing that a lot of the names are anagrams for different performers on the CD and U2.

B000000W5L|5.0|I am a true fanatic of the rolling stones and out of all of their albums, this truly is my favorite. A strong blues sound is seen through mick jagger. This is the defining moment to tell what the rolling stones is all about. Mick Taylor is still with the group, with keith richards, bill wyman, and charlie watts as usual at their best. They define themeselves as a Blues based rock and roll band. hardcore in my opinion. this is why blues based exile is considered one of their best albums and my favorite. From happy, to tumbling dice the singles and my favorites, soul survivor, hip shake, and rip this joint, all of the songs are excellent. get a good impression of the stones, by this album.
B00000JGHM|5.0|Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are two reasons to see any film. Add in Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd and Tom Sizemore and you have what we call an all-star cast. The acting is superb, better than any [-thing] Hollywood puts out. This picture has suspense and thrills. It also has the best bank robbing scene I have ever viewed. It can match up with any work Pacino has done, and falls short of every DeNiro film besides Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. This is the ultimate crime drama.
0312265859|5.0|Again Evanovich hits gold with her lastest installment in the Stephanie Plum saga. My sides hurt from laughing so hard. Will Joe ever speak to her again? What will happen with Ranger? Evanovich keeps the suspense high and the comedy rocking. Can't wait for the next !!!
068483605X|5.0|This story ranks right up there with, 'The Lord of the Rings', 'The Wizard of Oz', and \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" as one of the best adventure novels I've ever read. To be honest, when I first heard it was a story about a bunch of rabbits I wasn't very optimistic that it could have anywhere near as much action in it as it did. I was pleasantly surprised however to see that I was wrong in this regard.<br />The main character is a buck named Hazel (not exactly the name I would have picked for a main character) who leads by utilizing the best assets of the other rabbits around him, each of which has his own special attribute. (They are either a good fighter, runner, storyteller, fortuneteller, tracker, builder, or has the ability to cheer everyone up around them with a good joke.)<br />Due to a premonition that one of the rabbits received (Fiver), Hazel leads a group of rabbits to find a new burrow before impending doom falls upon the warren they lived in. On the way they have to avert many dangers and overcome several difficulties.<br />At one point they find a burrow of rabbits who look in excellent health, but they have some dark hidden secret which they are not sharing. It reminds me of a scene out of H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine' when the main character travels into the future to finds people being treated like cattle.<br />Richard Adams does an excellent job maintaining all of the rabbits nuances while at the same time giving them additional human attributes. They behave in military fashion, have a type of religion, create art, play games, make up poems, and tell stories. (I especially loved the stories of El-ahrairah who is a very clever rabbit much like Brair-rabbit.)<br />Some of the rabbits in this book have tried to better themselves. In some instances this is shown as a good thing, and in others it is quite harmful. This is done similar to how Mary Shelly in her novel 'Frankenstein' showed the effects of what happens when man tries to act like God.<br />General Woundwort who is the villain is shown in both regards. His warren is prosperous and safe, but he eventually turns into a tyrant. He also has the strength to take on bigger animals than himself which is an unnatural trait for a rabbit.<br />Overall I'd say this book was excellent, and I think it deserves to be listed as one of the best novels of all time./>General Woundwort who is the villain is shown in both regards.

B00005JL9B|4.0|This movie is very shocking as it is filled with mass amounts of ultra violence. 42 students sent to an island to play a game, which is the battle royale. But game, it is not, as it is more like 'survival of the fittest'.<br />This movie is not for the weak of mind to watch.
B00003CX5P|2.0|Star Wars Episode II: The Phantom Menace is the first in the Star Wars stories according to George Lucas. I must say I enjoyed Attack Of the Clones much better than this one.<br />This movie was filled with too many creatures and special effects that made it seem like a merchandisers  warehouse for all the future toys that were going to be released. The story too simple to be enjoyable and the one character that drove me crazy was Jar Jar Binks. I couldn't understand him and ended up hating him. The stand out performance for me was Liam Nielson and Ewan McGregor. The kid and Jar Jar could disappear and the movie might have improved. Natalie Portman was honest and simple but very convincing as the diplomatic ruler of the now failing senate.<br />That was the theatrical release for me - now the DVD release is much different. This multi-million dollar production works much better for me on the small screen. I can hear everything and skip past jar Jar when I want to. The visual effects and the technical aspects of the film are amazing.<br />The DVD also has tons of extras including some stuff for your PC. It also has several documentaries and several behind the scenes looks at the technical makings of the movies. It has prints and posters of all kinds. It is a good DVD for the Star Wars fan , but for the Sci-Fi fan -it's like Star Trek V- The Final Frontier - no one really wants it, but you got to have it because it is part of the series. Make sense? (8-13-02)
B00003CX95|5.0|on your death bed...Do you want to say, \\"I never saw Braveheart\\"  I don't think so.  This movie is outstanding from beginning to end...something for men and women.  Hard-knuckle action for the men, and Man loves woman, man loses woman, man gets revenge for losing woman, and man finds another woman for all the women in the audience.  This is the kind of movie Mel was born to make, not that silly dressing up like a woman stuff he did with Helen Hunt...what was the name of that?  Anyway...You must see this, and buy it.  It should be in every DVDites library, PUT IT ON THE TOP SHELF!
0345440803|3.0|I really enjoyed the Secrets of the Baby Whisperer and had given it as gifts.  So when my daughter became a toddler, I knew I had to see what Tracy said about 'toddlerhood'.  I guess I was expecting too much of her...it just seemed like so much of the same from her first book and a lot of common sense.  <BR>If you didn't read the first book and have a toddler, get this book, otherwise, don't bother.
B000069HKH|5.0|Bruce fans,<br />I am going to complete a thorough review of this CD soon.  I had to voice my feelings about the song \\"missing\\"  This song speaks to your heart directly!! When a person loses a loved one and the void that is so apparent and how much it hurts and how real it is and how sad it is.  This is the closest experience to life we can feel as human. When you listen to this song please remember people who you love and relish those loved ones.  NOW!  The rememberance of loved ones is sweet. To hold them dear now So very important!!<br />The most moving , stiring, real song I have heard in Years!!!<br />Standing Ovation!!!<br />Anyone alive needs to feel this song!!!<br />More reviews of these songs will follow in upcomming days!!<br />Thanks for reading my thoughts!!!
B000067DNC|5.0|what can you say the best of the best of stargate sg1 so far the exters are mind blowing, its all round one of the best dvds yoou can buy on the market oh and if you did not know im just a bit of a fan well im a very big fan buy this dvd box set and enjoy it from Scott.
B00005OCMR|4.0|I hadn't seen Tron since some Disney Channel showing about 12 years ago, and I started watching this new DVD version believing I would have to \\"put up with\\" ancient computer graphics that would look incredibly silly after two decades of advances.  I was so wrong.  The many years that have gone by don't subtract from the sense of being inside a game that these graphics convey.  The weird glow surrounding everything and the blocky vehicles suit the mood and setting perfectly.  It wasn't long before I stopped thinking about the age of the graphics and just started enjoying them.  It occured to me how great a new PC game version of this story would be, and a few weeks later, it turns out they are making a sequel to this story and the graphics look great and are very remeniscent of what you find in this movie.<br />The opening 10 minutes or so of setup leading to Jeff Bridges' entry into the Tron game world are very cheesy, very campy, and very very 80s.  After that part is finished, express your sigh of relief and enjoy the rest of the movie-  until the resolution of the conflict and the reemergence from the cool computer world.  Then it becomes cheesy, campy, and 80s again for the last 3-5 minutes.  A small price to pay for all that great fun in between.<br />This movie is for the true science fiction fan who doesn't demand ILM realism in order to be swept away into a great concept.  It still has the ability to wow if the viewer goes into it with an open mind.  Closed minded people beware:  you have probably already put this one on the shelf with anything representative of the late 70s-early 80s scene.  But this is not Xanadu, The Wiz, or The Misfits of Science (all of which I like bits of too).  If you can open your mind to something a little different, take this one down off of the 80s shelf and give it a try.
B000001FFJ|5.0|I bought this album in February 2002, when I was kind of going through a rough time. My girlfriend and I were on the verge of breaking up, which was pretty difficult for me. And these songs all spoke to me. Tom Waits has a way of saying things so simple yet very profound, and his voice is very eloquent, although it's very throaty. His use of unusual instruments such as the marimba, and the jarring percussion, and the dissonant guitar tones reflected the paranoia and anguish I seemed to be going through at the time, and I can't think of an album I've listened to more than Rain Dogs. <BR><BR>The title even speaks of loneliness. A \\"rain dog,\\" is supposedly an abandoned dog that has been left out side to fend for himself, or to die. At that time, I felt pretty inferior as I was being thrown out of another one's life, which I have since recovered from, and I learned to live with myself. Before then, I never really knew what the possibilities in music were, and this and other Waits albums, completely opened the floodgates to what was possible out there, and a lot of my writing is influenced by Waits, but I don't really mimic his style. <BR><BR>I'm sure everyone who has bought this album looked at music at a newer perspective, because it certainly did for me, and my friends who have heard this album. It's full of emotion and idealism that you can't help but feel like this record at times. In my Top 10 of Favorite Albums of all time, and certainly my favorite by a solo artist (with Nick Drake's bleak Pink Moon coming in a close second, following any Peter Gabriel album).
B00005YW4H|5.0|It's impossible not to fall in love with this CD.  It's not fast-paced at all, so you'll be disappointed if that's what you expected.  But if you're looking for something along the lines of sweet, smooth traditional jazz, the kind to which you watch the moon rise over the desert, then you'll be in heaven.  Jones' young voice is startlingly mature, rich, and hypnotic, and the musical arrangements are timeless, yet modern without a touch of anything overprocessed or cliched.  The songs, a few covers but mostly originals, contain lyrics that are moody and familiar in the way that they seem to reach straight into the heart and expose faint memories of old loves or add sensual mystery to new ones.  I purchased this CD a few days ago and have not stopped listening to it since.  This CD comes with me in the car, into work (where several of my co-workers have since purchased their own copies), and of course at home.
B000069I1H|3.0|&quot;Showtime&quot; is one of those films where you can pretty much call out everything that's going to happen right before it happens. Very predictable. It is, however, good for a few laughs and an hour and a half of entertainment if you go into it not expecting too much. There are some good one liners and the comedy from Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro are strictly the same comedy you always see from them. Nothing new. <br />Basically, the movie is about DeNiro being forced into doing a reality show about cops and having to be partnered with Eddie Murphy who he doesn't think is a good cop. That's about it. The plot is weak at best. The acting is good (due to the two main stars incredible acting ability and experience) but the talent is somewhat wasted on a poor script. There really isn't that much &quot;action&quot; one or two good action sequences, but even those aren't that exciting. Much more dialogue than anything else and when you factor a weak script into that scenario you get &quot;Showtime&quot; <br />Again, the movie isn't that bad, but you just can't expect too much. It'll cure 90 minutes of boredom. I am an enormous Robert DeNiro fan and this is why I saw it even amidst the many bad reviews. Mr. DeNiro, please make a movie that isn't a comedy...I'm not saying your bad at comedy, but I'd like to see you back in a role you were born to play! Please stop wasting your talents on mediocore scripts. Go for the gold again!!<br />The dvd is decent. Good picture and sound, not much in the way of extras. A commentary track but not with Eddie or Bob so basically worthless. My reccomendation is: Rent it don't Buy it.
B00004U2HK|5.0|An excellent sweet catchy movie. Great for the family, and a true story, what more could you want? I think the customers with the one two and 3 star ratings need to lighten up, I mean, you can't diss a classic. But I know classical light movies aren't for everyone, but The Sound of Music is for any person who is sick of the modern violent deep movies, and just wants to escape to an entertaining, easygoing film with very catchy and timeless songs.
B000066F6H|4.0|This album is nothing but good, clean punk. No frills...just stripped-down muscial energy. Damn good.
B000062XE1|3.0|I cannot remember being this disappointed by a book or DVD.  My generation has seen most of these films before, and the present offering just does not have the right actors.  To anyone who remembers &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; Michael Redgrave, Glinys Johns, Edith Evans and Margaret Rutherford just cannot be<BR>replaced by the present crop.  Prism simpers, Gwendolyn is overbearing without really being attractive, and Brenda Plowright just cannot fill the shoes of Edith Evans.  Continuing,<BR>Dorian Grey is a stick of wood and not truly beautiful, and the<BR>film is only saved by John Gielgud, who couldnt be bad if he tried.  &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; is the best, mostly because of Jeremy Brett, Margaret Leighton and the actress playing Mabel Chilton.  &quot;Lady Windermeres Fan&quot; is also hampered by the lead couple not being nearly attractive enough.  I wish I could have my money back.<BR>The quartet is almost - but not quite - saved by the biography of Oscar Wilde, which is extremely well done and compassionate.
0425173755|5.0|This is one of the best murder mysteries i've read. Guessing the end is really quite challenging and hats off to anyone who actually does. This is a slightly 'intellectual' thriller, meaning there is more to think about but not too much 'happening' in terms of action. Poirot prefers to trust his 'little grey cells' to solve any case!!<br />The story : Contrary to his plans, the famous detective Hercule Poirot ends up on the Orient express along with an assortment of fellow passengers of various nationalities. One of them approaches Poirot to help save his life, but Poirot declines the offer. The man is found murdered next day, stabbed in 12 places. The blows are such as to suggest at least two different people delivered them, and other clues are bewildering to say the least.<br />Further, since the train's stuck owing to heavy snowfall, the murderer(s?) must be on board, making the task of discovering their identity/identities all the more urgent.<br />Now the story really starts moving, as the passengers give their 'evidence' one by one, and Poirot proceeds to analyse, understand and deduce. He unravels a web of lies and deceit and soon it is apparent that many of the passengers know more than they're letting on and there is much more to it than meets the eye.<br />Before you know it, the story builds towards a stunning climax and the ending is truly memorable, which is what ultimately makes or breaks a thriller of this genre.<br /><br />All in all, an expertly crafted murder mystery which will keep you thinking all the while as you're furiously flipping pages. Strongly recommended.
B000067CPX|5.0|This cd is stuck in my cd player. Not because I cant get it out, because it is that awsome of a cd. Although this is a different change of pace if compared to BSSM, it still is the red hot chili peppers, which makes it one hell of a cd. There isnt one track on this cd I skip. When I play it, I listen to the whole thing through, Although there is some songs I listen to more than others. My favorite song on the cd is Cant Stop. John tears it up on the guitar, and the vocals on this song are by far my favrote out of all the tracks. Every song has a different style and different change of pace, and if I went through and described every one It would result in about 10 pages. Thats what the peppers bring to the table with this cd.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|A great director is born! The sign of a true artist is to take a simple story or scene and recreate it masterfully. That, in short, is what Christopher Nolan has done with what would have otherwise been a by-the-numbers film noir tale.  Memento sticks with you like a bad head cold. You just can't get it out of your system long after you've seen it.  The endless plot twists, the ingenious editing ploys, the ambiguity and mystery of each character, the backwards tatoos, and oh that cool Jaguar! All superb! Memento is the thinking man's mystery movie. <br />Guy Pierce gave the performance of the year. This was arguably the most difficult role in years. Here's why: Guy had to play a character that a) did or did not rape and kill his own wife, b) if he did kill his wife, he had to hide it behind the deer-in-the-headlights performance, but that would be difficult since he has forgotten the details of the murder thus he would have to invent conceit from fleeting bits of memory, c) if he is innocent, as an actor, Guy can't give away that he is innocent otherwise he gives away the movie. So how do you play a guy that might or might not be innocent of a crime that he doesn't remember committing or maybe he does but has conveniently forgotten. See what I mean? Guy Pierce deserved the Oscar if for no other reason than he delivered an impeccable American accent (the guy's Australian).<br />This is about as close as modern filmmaking will get to duplicating the effects of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Hitchcock literally took us inside his character's mind by going to great pains to show the story unfold from the character's perspective (Vertigo, Spellbound, Rear Window, etc.) Christopher Nolan accomplishes similar results with the visual trick of looping back every 10 minutes and repeating the action because the character's short term memory only lasts about 10 minutes then he has to re-create his life again. This goes on throughout the entire film (and possibly ad infinitum). We never actually solve the mystery which is the most frustrating and yet most deliberate part of this film. You, the audience are actually supposed to figure the mystery out. You are, believe it or not, required to think through this film. I know, I know, we're supposed to think? At a movie?<br />The character played by Carrie-Anne Moss is actually similar to the character of Constance played by the gorgeous Ingrid Bergman in Hitchcock's 'Spellbound'. She too had to help an amnesiac, played by Gregory Peck, regain his memory. <br />Memento has some sidesteps that confused and frustrated me. For instance, the ending was a bit abrupt and could have been more skillfully explained. Saying that Leonard \\"raped\\" and murdered his wife was probably over-the-top and made me wonder why would a husband rape his own wife first and then murder her? It cast doubts in my mind that Leonard committed the crime because most crimes of passion don't involve raping your wife first. The black and white flashbacks of the old man were a distraction and a side story that I have yet to piece together. Some eagle-eye observers on the internet spotted Teddy in the background of those flashback scenes. Did Teddy kill Leonard's wife? Did Leonard kill his own wife and then kill Teddy to shut Teddy up? Will Carrie-Anne Moss go out with me?
0375703764|3.0|The 3 star rating is an average between those who will find House of Leaves an engaging intellectual challenge (4 ½ stars) and those who fill find it an incomprehensible mess (1 ½ stars). It's an average of the gripping tale of the Navidsons and the self-indulgent story of Johnny Truant. Like the House, parts of the work are larger than you expect, and (unfortunately) parts are smaller.<br />If you can get past it's flaws, you will find that Danielewski has spun an interesting (and genuinely eerie) yarn (or two, or three). There are sparks of real genius in the book that can transcend the pretensions, and the unusual - though not unique, check out David Foster Wallace - style is an asset when it is not taken too far.<br />The Good: The Navidson's and their friends are believable and given a reasonable amount of depth given the format (an analysis of a video record). Their plight is genuinely suspenseful moving from simply disconcerting to parts that are truly scary. It's relatively easy to empathize with these people. This is definitely a story worth reading! Johnny Truant's plight is also easy to empathize with, particularly for readers who can get truly engrossed in a book. The book format can be a great asset - as a means of bringing the various stories together into a whole, it generally works. It requires the reader to abandon traditional \\"beginning-middle-end\\" thinking in order to get the most out of it and that, in and of itself, can be a joy. Even the use of a colored font wherever the word \\"house\\" appears is a nice touch.<br />The Bad: Johnny Truant isn't nearly as plausible as the Navidsons. His life is more of a post-adolescent fantasy than anything that happens in the real world - even in L.A. The insights provided into Zampano are infrequent and occasionally inconsistent - one wonders why any attempt was made at all. And the frequent use of footnotes, while sometimes an asset, hopelessly break up the emotional rhythm of the story when the tension should be highest.<br />The Ugly: It's possible to get WAY too much of a good thing. Chapter 9 - with it's over-the-top barrage of intercut, sideways, backward, inverted and overstruck text; it's (admittedly!) meaningless lists; and footnotes that fall off into oblivion - is a disaster. Perhaps it is meant to give the reader a taste of the same disorientation experienced by the characters, but it becomes simply tedious. Later, pages and pages of emptiness interrupted by a word or two, often at odd angles and formats, certainly make the pages fly by, but this quickly get old. Sadly, none of these excesses add anything to the story. A gradual increase in the size of the margins - slightly shrinking the text - would have been more subtle and might actually have increased the feeling of claustrophobia. [BEWARE: THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH IS A SPOILER.] And Johnny Truant's descent into madness and destitution ends with ... nothing. He miraculously (and without explanation) becomes available to the \\"Editor\\" as if he's just another normal guy buying groceries, paying the bills, etc.<br />One final note: take the time to go online and look up the Pulitzer-winning photograph mentioned in the book. Seeing this chilling image adds significantly to the impact of the book. And then look up the tragic story of the real-life photographer who took it. The real world has always had more horror in it than can ever be found in fiction.
B000002AVF|5.0|after Music Box's amazing success (28 million copies sold worldwide), Mariah came up with another winner album, Daydream.<BR>The first single, Fantasy, released in the Fall of 1995, broke airplay records when it was leaked to radio stations and played every half an hour. It eventually spent 3 weeks at #2 and 7 (!!!) weeks at #1 on the AIRPLAY chart. And it was also the first single by a female artist to debut at #1. Then, One Sweet Day, Mariah's immortal duet with Boyz II Men, not only debuted at #1 as well, but also went on to become the most successful single in history (16 weeks at the top). It would eventually spend 13 weeks at #1 on the AIRPLAY chart. But it was far from over for Mariah. The album's third single, Always Be My Baby, debuted at #2 and quickly went to #1 where it would spend 2 weeks (if it hadn't been for Celine Delin it would have been 9 weeks at #1) and win a \\"Special Airplay Award\\" for being the most played song on the radio all over America in 1996.<BR>So, as u can c, Mariah's success is unmatchable. And this is only a tiny little bit of her lenghty 12-year-old career. <BR>Go Mariah, u'r the best and your fans are waiting for you to release your next album this December.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie, but it wasn't very original. Even the &quot;The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love&quot; phrase was borrowed from a song in an old movie I clicked by on A&amp;E. It's fun to watch, but if you're looking for something original, buy something else not directed by Baz Luhrmann.
0446677450|1.0|It seems every few years one book of \\"expert advice\\" rises above all others. In a world of get rich quick with no money, skill, or talent publications, this is no small accomplishment.<br />For whatever reason, this one book strikes a chord - usually one of discontent -  with a multitude of readers.  It taps into the vein of naivete and gullibility and strip-mines it dry.  In short, it plays upon the reader's desperation. Good cover art, a catchy title and, above all, timing, are the key ingredients.  If the author of the book is reasonably photogenic, and can speak in whole sentences on the book tour, you have a sure-fire best seller.  Such a book is Robert Kiyosaki's, \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\".<br />A quaint fantasy about a man, who, as a boy, is blessed with a poor educated idiot biological dad and a surrogate mysterious rich dad of cryptic knowledge and shadowy talents.  How can one resist such a plot line?  My wife couldn't, she may despise them, but she knows they are my bread and butter in between quality fantasy books.  This book is so full of contradictory and confusing advice I am certain the author is both the Rich and the Poor Dad caught in a viscous web of dueling personalities.  Not only is the \\"expert\\" advice contradictory, it is, for the most part, inaccurate and financially dangerous. <br />The author is what is known on the streets - a place where I learned much about business - as an \\"angler\\".   He is the person who is always on the make, always looking for that one angle others have missed.  With this book, Kiyosaki has seemingly hit the mother lode.  He offers little of substance and the rare nugget of intelligent advice given is promptly - usually on the very same page - sluiced away.   But, it is packaged so slick, you may buy into it.  At your own peril.<br />Perhaps we see our own dad in the \\"poor dad\\", the dad who had to work for a living, work for his money, the dad who did those mundane things in life, like feed us, clothe us and send us through school, earning our youthful ignorant disdain in the process.  Perhaps we see \\"rich dad\\" as the savior, the man with all the answers, and no responsibility to boot.  Ah, indeed, that is the life.  However, this book purports to be truth, not fiction.  <br />The advice given is given with the utmost sincerity, and with the reckless disregard of a street hustler selling fake Rolexes.  Buy this book if you wanted to own a book about the things to avoid on the road to financial success.  This is surely that book.  \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" is a book that will take you a few hours to read and, if the advice given within is heeded, a lifetime to overcome.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is one of the best Iron maiden albums of all time, along with &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; and &quot; Seventh Son of a Seventh Son,&quot; &quot;Brave New World.&quot;  Bruce Dickinson's return is extremely welcome, after the last two albums, which on average were truly horrid.<br />I was going to go on, but you get the idea.  Check out the other reviews and the samples.
6301095014|4.0|John Rambo is once again caught up in the world of War and death as he comes out of 'retirement' to rescue his long time friend Colonel Trautmen from the Russians in Afghanistan.<br />This explosive action movie brings back Sylvester Stallone as the grunting, no-smiles, super buff, near indestructible, one-man army guy, John Rambo. With a vast array of weaponry (some I'm sure he pulls out of nowhere), helicopter gunships, tanks, his trustee Rambo bowie knife, and funny one liners, he will win this war, even if he has to kill everyone to prove it. This is great for a high-action, no brainer night of fun with the mates. RECOMMENDED!!!
B000002LK1|5.0|I won't waste your time re-writting the praise found in the other reviews, it is all true.  This is DM at their best, if their most commercial.  Enjoy the Silence is worth the price of admission alone, but all the tracks are great.  This is another desert island disc for me.  The soulfull vocals, killer syths and teeth rattling bass are good enough to win about any music fan over, except for maybe country lovers.  :)<br />Do yourself a favor and get this disc now!  For this price of these used CDs, you just can't go wrong.  I only wish it had been this cheap when I was getting my collection together.<br />\\"All I ever wanted was you in my arms....\\"
B00005YXZH|3.0|I have never been a huge fan of Wilco, they've always seemed to be on the peripheral to what I was listening to and highly recomended by people who think alt-coutry is a real style of music. I finally was seduced into buying this album by having the patience to listen to and get over the pop cliche of &quot;an expiremental phase&quot;. . . and I found that all the noise (which I usually love) does a lot to balance the band's often boring delivery and unexceptional vocals. Semi-depressing songs and some noise does-not-an-art-album-make but some how I think Wilco pulls it off here and delivers a nice, if not expected album.
B000002LCI|5.0|If I had to only choose 3 DM albums to take with me to a desert island, this would be one of them.  It has classic tracks like Strangelove, Little 15, Pleasure Little Treasure, and Never Let Me Down Again that make it a must have.  But there is no filler, this is all well done DM music.  From the more experimental PIMPF to the more mainstream stuff, this stands out as one of DM's crowning achievments.  I consider myself one of their biggest fans, having everything of theirs  I can get my hands on, and this is one of the best.<br />I can't stress enough how wonderful this album is.  If you are into electronic music, new wave, or just want to relive high school memories, this is the album to get.  Never Let Me Down Again will forever be an anthem for me and my high school friends.  Check out the video if you can.<br />Get it.  It is great.  Enough said...
B000056K04|4.0|It is a great album to new listeners of DMB.  In fact it probably drew a lot of new listeners to him.  He did not sell out and I think that is a new refreshing way to listen to his music.
B0000508U6|1.0|Coldplay have bee compared to early Radiohead, the implication being if you wanted &quot;The Bends part 2&quot; instead of Kid A, then these are the boys for you.<br />Don't be fooled!  Coldplay are fourth-rate impostors.  This CD does not stand the test of repeated plays - I never want to hear &quot;Yellow&quot; again!
B000063USY|5.0|This movie was awesome! Vin is hot and sexy. I found myself irresistibly drawn to Vin and Paul.  Paul went from cute in \\"Varsity Blues\\" to whoa! in this flick.  And Vin, he's just damn sexy!
B00005QXXO|5.0|the live versions of the songs here are stronger and have more energy than the studio versions.  This is how they should be heard - turn it up!
B00003CXCW|5.0|We first see Norma Desmond,(played beautiful by Gloria Swanson), as she is looking down from the second story of her aging, delapidated mansion.  Her first words are, \\"Where have you been?  I've waiting for you?\\".  While these are directed to Joe Gillis (William Holden), they could well have been directed to the audience.<br />Everything about this film is perfect.  Sure it's melodramatic, but that was the style of film in the 1950's.  Everything is symbolic and yet works into the story beautifully.<br />Norma is an aged, forgotten silent movie actress.  Joe is a young, talented but forgettable screenwriter.  While worlds apart, they are both outsiders.  Norma blames \\"talking pictures\\" and screenwriters for her downfall and the downfall of the film industry; Joe is the embodiment of all her excuses for a failed career.  And while Joe is using Norma to get the money he needs to stay in the game, she is using him to perfect the script that she wrote, and hopes, will get her back in.<br />Norma's house is the perfect setting for the film.  A gothic, spanish-style mansion that represents Norma's career - old, run down, and forgotten behind the tall trees and shurbs of time, with gates and fences to keep out reality.  Joe IS reality and while Norma wants no part of the real world, she needs his connection to help her \\"return to the millions of fans that have never forgiven [her] for leaving the screen\\".  Norma's world is a fragile, imitation of yesterday and her forgotten career.  There are only two ways out of a world like this - death or madness.  Joe and Norma have no other paths to take.  And while the viewer watches these two desperate souls continue on their downward, spiraling paths, the viewer - like Norma's faithful servant Max - is powerless to intervene.<br />This film is for anyone who enjoys a well written, thought-out story with all the twists and turns of a gothic novel; for anyone who can appreciate classic hollywood at it's finest; for anyone who simplylikes a good film.<br />This film was also Gloria Swanson's \\"return\\" piece.  Like Norma Desmond, she was a silent film star that found few jobs after the \\"talkies\\" came to town.  <br />Buy it and add this classic tale to your collection.
B0000062GE|5.0|Didn't these guys ever hear of &quot;positive mental attitude&quot;?<br />Easily one of the least cheerful bunch of rockers in the world, Stabbing Westward again prove that they know how to write great riffs, haunting melodies and chilling lyrics.<br />&quot;Darkest days&quot; features some extremely rich and varied tracks like &quot;The thing I hate&quot; &amp; &quot;Waking up beside you&quot;, chock-full of angst.  Great stuff.
B00000AFDW|1.0|I can´t give this album a more generous rating. I will not even discuss the quality of the music. The trouble here is of a different subject.<br />This product was advertised as a KISS reunion, be it: the four guys from their glorious days: the boss Stanley, the boss Simmons and Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.<br />But, surprise!!! Altought Frehley and Criss´s names are in the credits, they simply did not perform in the album!!! The guitar solos were made by Stanley; Criss played drums in only one track. Frehley played rhythm guitar in a pair of others. <br />How can Kiss devise such a scheme to swindle some of their loyal fans is beyond my grasp.
B00004Z459|5.0|The best album I have ever heard.  I wouldn't think that a hybrip of hard rock, rap, and dj mixing could be deep and beautiful, but Linkin Park proved me wrong.  Powerful lyrics, amazing vocals, and a glorious performance on the whole, with styles covering the entire musical spectrum.  I would pay $100 for this CD even though I'm only a poor college kid.
0316666343|3.0|I agree with the comment from KY, I, too thought I had hit the jackpot after being the first to check the novel out of my local library, and after reading half the book, I realized I was in for a dissappointment. It was okay, but not great. I've read alot better, such as N.Sparks, &quot;The Notebook&quot; - now that for me was a tear-jerker. I guess everyone is different, but in my opinion the book was fair. I definately won't be re-reading it as others have commented. Didn't enjoy how the author kept jumping back and forth from past to present, from heaven to earth. Skim one topic, then a chapter later go into detail about that same topic.
B000069CWE|5.0|Like Hybrid Theory, Reanimation is an incredible CD.  It takes the unbelievable songs off their previous album, and sharpens them to a hip-hop edge.  It works as a dual gateway, introducing metal-only fans to the world of hip-hop and rap, and also lets hard-core rap fans a view of the best in new metal.  I recommend it to any music fan.
0316666343|5.0|This is a great book that grabs you by the collar from the first page.  The author does a magnificent job of writing in a 14 year old's voice.  Everything she says sounds exactly like you would expect an actual 14 year old to sound.  The book is haunting, but somehow funny and endearing.  I loved this book and highly recommend it.
B00006690G|5.0|In his earlier days (all the way back in 1999), it was easy to dismiss Eminem and his Slim Shady alter-ego as over-the-top, convoluted attempts to be funny.  Detractors tended to focus on his anti-gay, anti-women lyrics (although they are not any different than most other hip-hip/rappers' words), and his proponents set their sights on Em's amazing rhyming ability and a sense of the harmonious, rhythmic flavor of hip-hip that escapes most high-paid artists.  On his first disc, The Slim Shady LP, Em ranted and raved at the world and made a lot of money for doing it.  On his second, The Marshall Mathers LP, Em dealt with fame and controversy, although his raving still came across more as funny than anything else (Elton John agreed to play with Eminem despite protests from GLADD because he \\"got the joke,\\" according to the rapper).<br />Enter Em's third major studio album, The Eminem Show.  Despite the title and the initial single, \\"Without Me,\\" The Em Show turns its focus away from Eminem somewhat in favor of tackling some enormous issues.  After the typical skit introduction - a series of real/fake speeches cobbled together from different awards shows where Em won something - Em raps right into White America, a heady, accusatory song that puts him directly at odds with his main detractors: white suburbanites whose experiences are much different than Em's own.  Forth on the CD is \\"Cleaning Out My Closet\\" (also used in the trailer for Em's upcoming film 8-Mile).  The song lives up to its name: he manages to exorcise the ghosts of his hateful attitude towards both his mother and his ex-wife, attributing some of his anger to a father that left before Em was a year old and a hypochondriac mother who projected her psychosomatic diseases onto Em.  He raps about venereal disease on \\"Drips\\" (an excellent argument for safer sex) and conformity in \\"Soldier\\" before returning to himself in \\"Without Me,\\" before heading off into skitland later in the album.  Also notable are the semi-tender ballad \\"Hallie's Song\\" (he warns you beforehand that he can't sing), and \\"Superman,\\" which has nothing to do with the comic hero and everything to do with unreasonable relationship expectations.<br />Perhaps its making too much of Eminem to say that his lyrics are inspired; one cannot deny, though, that his anger at his situation and the crummy things that have happened in his life simmers right beneath the surface of this album, more of a middle-finger to the world than to specific people, as his earlier efforts were.  Em risks inviting comparison to Rage Against the Machine (not that doing so would be a bad thing), and although his anger could use solid direction, it's clear that his heart is in the right place - just because crummy things happen doesn't mean they SHOULD, and sometimes the only way to stop these things from happening in the future (or to call attention to the fact that they are happening now) is to drag them out of dark little holes where society likes to stuff them, bring them out in the open, and make them as shocking as possible.  Pure schlock-shock, a la Marilyn Manson, is out of style, and Em wisely stayed away from that on The Eminem Show.  Instead, he has crafted a burning arrow of rage and leveled it straight at the heart of hypocritical America.<br />He may not be Gandhi, but Eminem is more of an activist than, say, Martha Stewart.  Rap is the language of the underprivileged, and Em reminds us that being poor does not equal being black, and even the poorest of the poor have souls that need saving.  It's almost sad that it took the musical equivalent of a speeding train to raise this kind of awareness.  Every time Em goes on TRL, listeners can finally laugh WITH him at the sheer stupidity and hypocrisy of it all.<br />Final Grade: A--tender ballad \\"Hallie's Song\\" (he warns you beforehand that he can't sing), and \\"Superman,\\" which has nothing to do with the comic hero and everything to do with unreasonable relationship expectations.<br />Perhaps its making too much of Eminem to say that his lyrics are inspired; one cannot deny, though, that his anger at his situation and the crummy things that have happened in his life simmers right beneath the surface of this album, more of a middle-finger to the world than to specific people, as his earlier efforts were.

0679735909|1.0|i believe the poems were excessive and unsubstantial and the constant interpolations of other texts, diaries, memoirs, etc(one of which exceeded 30 pages, mostly a dull rendition of victorian daily life) were simply technical writing exercises posing as literature. it was a great idea for a story, with a nod to fowles, that was poorly executed. if byatt had spent more time on just simple character development and interior life, plot, etc and less time on extended writing samples for stage scenery, it could have been a great work.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Please stop writing reviews of Mulholland Drive.  And I couldn't agree more with the reviewer who said Naomi Watts should have taken home the Oscar.
B00004W52U|5.0|This cd is great. The songs are catchy and fun. They are one of the best punk bands ever, and I could easily classify them as in high of punk rock energy as The Ramones, The Clash,Anti-Flag, The Sex Pistols, or the Screeching Weasels. One question though, I also own Green Day's \\"1039 Smoothed out Slappy hours\\". The song \\"knowledge\\" is also performed by Green Day on that album. Why is this? I realise they were recorded under the same label around the same time. But what's the story? Anyways, pick it up, it's ...great.
0790729652|3.0|A mixed result. The intro with Danny Elfman's theme is excellent followed by the family lost in Gothom, which is pure brilliance. Here we see a man and a women with their son coming out of the theater. Surely we say to ourselves, this is the Wayne family returning from the Mark of Zorro where that anonymous killer comes out of the shadows with his gun forever altering young Bruce's life. But no! History does not repeat itself; tragedy is averted by Batman as he comes to stop the criminals.<br />I enjoyed Michael Keaton as Batman he certainly doesn't look the part but that's not what's most important. When one is dealing with a decades old pop culture icon there is plenty of room for different portrayals so I won't comment there. Except for one litter thing...<br />And this is where we get to the movie's fundamental flaw. \\"The Batman does not kill.\\" Batman's refusal to kill isn't some minor character detail, it is more essential to who he then the emblem on his chest. More than anyone else the Batman is someone who doesn't want to see another person die. That is what sets him apart from the other dark and gritty almost psycho action stars have been popular throughout the 20th century (from The Shadow to the Terminator) Michael Keaton has no problem with murder though. From spraying machine gun fire along a parade route to bombing factories to beating the Joker senseless (one could argue about his failure to save him both on the church and especially in the chemical plant) killing seems to come as natural to this Batman as to many of his enemies.<br />Perhaps I have been overly critical of the movie's flaws and it is important to keep them in perspective. This movie is far superior to any of the other live action portrayals of Batman (except for Batman: Returns which is almost as good). If one compares it to the cartoon movies it comes in just under the excellent \\"Mask of the Phantasm.\\"

B000002H1T|5.0|I have every one of their albums in cassette tape, CD format. I can't get enough of this group! I hear one album and I want more. I was fortunate enough to see this group in concert just before they called it quits. I had a blast!! A reunion tour is obviously out of question with the loss of Ben Orr. He will be greatly missed by all Cars fans.<BR>If you have never heard this group, try any of their albums. You will not be disappointed!!  I can't say which is my most favorite because I love them all. Enjoy!
B0000640VO|4.0|Amelie is the girl's answer to Fight Club. Fusing the style and energy of that testosterone charged film with the cuteness of a chick flick; this French film is something everyone can enjoy.<br />This story of a lonely girl becoming a do-gooder and eventually doing good for herself becomes a beautiful fantasy. It is a feel good movie without the usual audience manipulation tricks.<br />If any one thing is a negative in this film, it is the lack of an English dubbing option. The debate over which way is the best to watch a film in a foreign language, dubbed or subtitles, comes down to personal preference. I personally like to see films both ways, subtitled to hear the vocal tones and inflections actors give, preserving the film as the director intended; and dubbed so I can watch the visuals while understand what's being said. This film has so many wonderful visuals, at times I felt I was missing a lot while hurriedly reading the subtitles. It's unfortunate the DVD didn't come with a choice of viewing.<br />This is a great film, though, and well worth a spot on any film connoisseur's DVD shelf.
B000069CWE|4.0|The songs are totally different than the originals.  You don;t have to like the band to like this album.  Some of the best artists in hip-hop do work on the album.  I'm a big fan of underground hip-hop and Black Thought, Aceyalone, Chali 2na, Planet Asia and Pharohoe Monch do great work.  Also the best in rock are enlisted for a few tracks including Johnathan Davis from Korn and Aaron Lewis from Staind.  I highly recommend adding this to your collection.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I sincerely love good music, and I'm so glad I do not have to know much about music and its genres to like a piece of music.  \\"The Look of Love\\"  so far is my favorite Diana Krall album.  I love Dusty Springfield's version and really couldn't imagine anybody else doing as wonderful a job of it, until this album came along.  Now I do not love Springfield's version any less, but I think Krall pretty much does a good job of it in her own style. No problem in that. I really find it cool there are two versions I love of a favorite song.  If you're a romantic like I am, I guarantee you only have to hear the achingly beautiful first four notes of  \\"The Look of Love\\" in this album to fall into a swoon, and really want so hard to cuddle up with someone you love. <br />Cynics really won't find anything much in this album.  From the first song \\"S'wonderful\\" to the last ,\\"Maybe You'll Be There\\", it's all unapologetic swoon music. I love each and every song.  \\"I Remember You\\" is so [sensually] arranged, bossa-nova style.  \\"Dancing In The Dark\\"  has my favorite intro of all the songs here. It's so perfect for Krall's silky voice that's at turns husky, then breathy and whispery. It's my favorite, second to the title cut. Then, the piano-playing in \\"Besame Mucho\\" is just  plain heavenly.   If you love bossa-nova as I do, then chances are, you'll like this album even if it's not 100% bossa nova. It's light jazz with touches of edgy, seductive bossa nova in places.  I just couldn't get enough of this album.  I listen to it  over and over in my car. I'm afraid I'm going to have to buy another CD soon because I'll wear it out to bits. It's laidback rainy afternoon music, and I love rainy afternoons.  And browsing in a bookstore. And the smell of coffee. Yum.  I wouldn't mind elevator music this heartbreakingly beautiful.  Really. They should play this album in all the cafes and bookstores, too.  What a great idea, actually.  Yes, fill the air with Diana Krall!<br />Diana Krall has a great voice and a wonderful, amazing talent for playing the piano. In this album, her piano-playing and her voice complement each other well, and the genius melding of the two is showcased wonderfully by the arrangements that show this off to an advantage. The effect is pure enchantment. It's great Krall doesn't take herself too seriously, and limit herself to playing just artsy jazz songs. Her brand of talent really ought to be shared with a wide audience, and not just some critics who turn up their noses at this kind of an album.  (These guys really ought to ease up, have some love in their hearts, and there might just be hope for them yet.  Maybe, they just might then be able to allow a little bit of happiness in their lives.)   For those who do not care much for intellectualizing over their choices because they just want genuinely good music , I highly recommend this album.
0452282152|5.0|Where to begin on such a beautifully-written, compelling, vividly-imagined novel?  Tracy Chevalier writes a spectacular novel in general, and this is no exception.  The main character, Griet, and both the family she leaves and the one she comes to work for are so well-developed that if time-travel were possible through literature, the reader would find herself instantly transported to Vermeer's Holland.<BR>  Griet is a striking, ironic, observant young girl who posesses little materially but owns volumes of emotions, experiences, and the potential to love or hate fiercely.  However, Griet is also a calm, mature young woman who knows to keep her feelings hidden in this time of male dominance.  She is most devoted to her family, and most disgusted with her mistress, the Mrs. Vermeer, and one of the numerous Vermeer children.<BR>  The story could not have been any more detailed, as Chevalier did her research of not only Vermeer himself, but of Holland and historical rituals and mannerisms that exist within.<BR>  The most exquisite semi-plot within the story is that of Griet's relationship with Johannes Vermeer.  She reveres him, yet is terrified of him at once.  In this chasm of opposites the reader is given only miniscule morsels of her feelings outright.  Much more often, the subtlety paints an even more compelling picture.  When Vermeer decides to use Griet as a subject of a secret painting, their relationship becomes a conspiracy, almost erotic and racy in the most demure and reserved way.  The air between them is so sexually charged and yet professional all at once.  Griet seems to have an inner-obsession, profoundly affected by any action or word from her \\"Master.\\"  It's sick, but gorgeous.  <BR>  We watch as Griet finds herself in sorrow, in love, in desperation, in ecstasy, and finally, inside her own body.  Griet becomes a woman: strong, independant, and willing to sacrafice for her family and for herself.<BR>  Buy this book.  It's a jewel, a prized possessionfor any literature lover.  Complex yet simply told, but with immense feeling and honesty.  You will love it!  Plus, you might become so enchanted with it, you'll plan your own trip to Holland to see where Griet \\"lived\\" and where her likeness (fictionally, of course) now hangs in the Hague.  Chevalier: bravo!  Wonderfully imagined.
0553381687|5.0|That's the question I asked myself when I decided to start this book.  I had read all the reviews and wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  I won't bother with plot synopsis because it's too darn complicated, but let's just say this in an engrossing book.  The 800 pages flew by and left me wanting more.  Although this novel is considered fantasy, you won't be beaten over the head with trolls/orcs/dragons/etc.  Aside from the opening and closing chapters, there is no mention of monsters except for Old Nan's tales, a few reanimated corpses and the ever ominous Others beyond the Wall.  Make no mistake, there are creatures in this world, they're just not EVERYWHERE.  This may bother some hardcore fantasy readers, but the story and character development are so deep that you don't even miss them.  A great story, a great writer, a great series.
6300214826|5.0|spacy movie leaves a lot to the imagination dont get the REDUX all it has are spoilers
B00005JKEC|5.0|Ethan Hawke steals the show from the hyped Denzel Washington in my opinion. Still, two tremendous actors like Washington and Hawke on the same screen should say enough for this great film.<br />Judging by the other 330+ reviews that have already been posted(LOL), I'll give you my short analysis. Buy it, rent it, copy it, do whatever it takes to watch this one. You like cop movies? Than this it your ticket to a great evening.<br />peace

B0000027G6|5.0|It's as if he's dissapeared like the buffalo in this film.  He does a remarkable job with Dances With Wolves. I'm no expert on musical scores, so if something HAS happened to Barry, I'm sorry for my ignorance. Now, onto my views on the score.....<br />One word to describe this score: inspiring. That's right. This cd will inspire you, bring tears to your eyes from pure joy, and make you feel like you're actually dancing with wolves yourself. The John Dunbad Theme, track #2, is purely splendid. It has to be one of the greatest songs devised from a musical score in the history of film.<br />Other notable songs on this one include track #4, #6, #7, #8, #9(a personal favorite of mine), and #18, a long song that includes most of the theme music from throughout the film.<br />Hearing this music will make you feel like you can fly, and I don't say that sarcastically at all. You will feel triumph, joy, anger, fear, and sympothy when you listen to this score. And my, what a fun journey it is. You can't go wrong with this cd.
B00006690G|4.0|i gotta like shady he tells it like it is and even though the lyrics are more mature they dont seem to be as deep on some songs
B00003XACV|5.0|Just when you think it's safe to judge Thomas Newman and call him a musical leach, one who carries melodies over to other scores, he blasts us with a new wave of creativity, seemingly knocking the critical teeth out of our mouths.  <br />I personally am thankful for this and I'll gladly admit to being one of the first to be missing some teeth right now. Thomas has hit us again, this time with a delightfully spunky score that makes us feel like we should strip down naked, smear peanut butter on our chests, and dance around the house with the windows open! Or maybe that was just me. ;-)<br />Anyways, this score is simply great. The melodies change from funny to serious to sad within the span of just over thirty-seven minutes. But, before you are derailed by the time, remember that Newman has a knack for containing some of his best music in the space of two minutes.  You will hear echoes of How To Make An American Quilt in this one, but they are merely temporary, trailing off right before you give Newman the leach title. <br />Hey, this cd is brilliant and as a fellow music lover, I am being completely honest with you. You won't want to take this one back after hearing it. Enjoy!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Besides this being the greatest album ever, what I enjoyed so much was Quincy's insights on this album.  The original album is incredible within itself but having the intervies and commentary was an extra treat worth buying this album all over again. There will never be another duo like Michael and Quincy.
B000004286|5.0|It seems as though everyone is already deeply in love with this score, and rightfully so. It is Horner's finest piece of work and probablly one of the top five musical scores in the history of film music.<br />It is purely magical, with the most poweful piece of music coming in track #17, the music that plays while Wallace is being killed. I still find myself lying on the bed and shouting, \\"FREEDOM!\\" as that portion of music is played. It's so fun. Try it if you already own the cd and aren't afraid to be a little goofy once in a while. :-)<br />As for Aaron Copeland, there is no doubt that the old [guy] would be deeply impressed as to how far his inspiration has gone. In Braveheart, it is undoubtedly portrayed.<br />If you love music, you will be doing yourself a grave injustice by not buying this score while there is still life in you!<br />EVERY MAN DIES, BUT NOT EVERY MAN TRULY LISTENS!
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is an amazing work, which takes up right where The Soft Bulletin left off.  <br />What I like to do is look for the one-star reviews of this album. That way I can identify the morons.  Of course, it would be easier if they just had a stamp on their forehead!
B00005RYP7|2.0|Sorry for the opening sarcasm, but I rented this one from pay-per-view, taping it as I usually do. I was expecting a great film with superb acting. Well, the acting was superb, with Diane Lane, the ever hottie she is ;-), doing another fantastic job as a drugged-out motherless wife. Her hubby, as it turns out, is in over his head with some mobster types. Well, they bring in some kids who have just lost their parents to a tragic...\\"accident\\", and have taken guardianship of them. Of course, our lovely couple really wants the money that was left to the kids and then.......<br />I was left holding the remote, aimlessly watching the credits role before my eyes, thinking I would have been better off having watched another one of ESPN's 'Sports Century' or even E's 'Wild On'...well, that last one might be a stretch.<br />In all fairness, Leelee(such a fun name) Sobieski is convincing and Diane Lane, well she's flat out hot. The plot, however, is pure nonesense. Of course, this is just my opinion. You might be one of those people who watches it, enjoys it, and places it on the movie shelf right next to Wild Things and Cruel Intentions.<br />Go in peace, my children, go in peace.
B00006690G|5.0|BUY BUY BUY! This is the greatest Eminem album ever! The maturity level on this CD is much more evolved then on his last two \\"The Slim Shady LP\\" and \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\". With such songs as \\"Cleanin Out My Closet\\" \\"Hailie's Song\\" \\"White America\\" \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\"(which his daughter Hailie sings the hook on)  and \\"Sing For The Moment\\" it really makes you stand back and see how far he's come. Though these songs are indeed more insightful and deep, they do also carry some bad mouthing to  woman, and life in general, (of course, this in Eminem we're talking about, but he does it in such a way that it doesn't really get in the way of these awesome songs.) Now, the one thing that I have lacked to speak about are the beats and the wicked tunes that accompany his ill rhymes. They are better then ever and just as strong to keep you bopin' your head 24/7.So, in conclusion, this album is a MUST HAVE for anyone who loves Eminem, hates him, or has never ever taken the time to listen to him, meaning, GET YOUR ...TO THE STORE AND BUY THIS!
B00004STPT|5.0|Zimmer hits us again with another roller-coaster of a muscial score. The listener is given a taste of violent battle music, hypnotic chords, vengeful tracks, and some of the finest end-of-the-movie-music since Braveheart and The Shawshank Redemption.<br />Each category of music in this film, from the peaceful tracks of Earth and Honor Him, to the mind jolting pieces like The Battle and Am I Not Merciful, we come to love every second of this melodic thrill ride. Zimmer fans will be much satisfied with this one and music fans will simply adore this score. It is captivating and enormously exciting to hear. Don't miss out on Gladiator.<br />Now, go be a busy little bee and buy it!
0380977788|4.0|I, too, was originally put off when I read that Neil Gaiman's newest book was a children's story. But it delivers the goods and is written in the typical Gaimanesque, dark-humorous style. <br />It may be intended for children, but much of the writing and creepy innuendo appeared more suitable for adults. In fact, there are a few allusions in this book that children may be better off not understanding.<br />If you are a Gaiman fan then you will whole-heartedly love this book. If you've never read him before this story is a good one to gauge whether you will like Gaiman's other works like Neverwhere, Smoke and Mirrors, Sandman, etc.<br />Surprisingly creepy!
B00005ATQI|5.0|I mean, he's as psyhchotic in the beginning as he is in the end.  Jack is talking about the people who ate each other in the olden days, a story he is telling to his son on the way to the hotel. His face and voice, however, look and sound just as freaky as they do at the end of the film. It's almost a little too hilarious.<br />The Shining is a masterpiece, a classic, yadda, yadda, you already know since all about since nearly 400 hundred people have already reviewed it. If there is an impossible chance that you know absolutely nothing about this film, you will find a great horror film about the mental breakdown of a man, only in Kubrick's version we can't really begin to see when Nicholson goes nuts. The reason I gave it five stars is based on the comedy it unknowingly possesses. No wonder Steven King hated Kubrick's guts long after this film was made.<br />NOTE TO VIEWER: There are a number of hilarious parts in this film, the scene where Nicholson is staring aimlessly out the window for one. The segment with the kid saying, &quot;Red Rum&quot; with his finger is an absolute laugh riot.<br />Also to note, THE SCARIEST THING ABOUT THIS FILM IS SHELLEY DUVALL. Is it just me or is that lady completely scary looking?<br /><br />WATCH THE MAKING OF THE SHINING, it's enough to make you pee your pants in laughter. Especially as you watch Nicholson. He's as nuts in real life as he is in this film.
B000021XS0|5.0|...I was looking for a new band to get into, when I gave these guys a chance.  I had heard they were prog-metal...  I'm a big fan of bands like Yes and Renaissance as well as Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath, so I decided to give it a shot.  I had already tried one prog-metal (or so I was told) band Tool, and I was completely underwhelmed, to say the least.  Dream Theater is a lot like I was hoping Tool would be like.<br />...  That first listen just blew me away.  'Scenes' is still my one and only Dream Theater album, but I plan on changing that soon.  Still, this disc was good enough to make me go after more.<br />There's really not a whole lot to say that other reviews haven't.  There are a few points I've got, though.<br />For one, I really, really don't like the sappy MOR ballad \\"Through Her Eyes\\".  I like it now a lot better than I did the first time through, but that woman crooning at the start just makes me cringe -- it's pretty telling of the music to come.  Cheesy and sappy.  Too bad, since it's a major plot point.  The other ballad, the Pink Floydish \\"The Soul Carries On\\", is much, much better.  <br />I'm not sure as to what my favorite track is, there are several good ones.  I started to get into the disc around \\"Through My Words\\", but the rest of Act I just goes up from there until it crashes and burns with \\"Through Her Eyes\\".  Act II isn't quite as memorable, IMO, but I do really like the Eastern-tingued \\"Home\\".<br />Definitely check this album out if you're thinking of checking out this band.  I'd reccomend this to a proghead certainly.  I'm not sure how a hardcore metalhead would react -- the ones I've met despise keyboard metal -- but if you're one, I guess this would be as good a gateway as any to Yes and the like.  More importantly, it restored my faith in the album.  One of the most satisfying things about this album is that it's an ALBUM -- it actually works together, in the grand scheme of things, and there's a definite ebb and flow.  Check it out.
B00005JKNB|2.0|Okay, okay, that was a little harsh but this film was a little harsh too. We get to see Truman Burbank in the sequal to the Truman Show.....oh wait, this isn't the Truman Show Part Duex? Sorry for the mistake.<br />In all fairness, the film isn't THAT bad. It's just that it isn't as good as we were all made to believe by the selective raving reviews by the press. In it, we have Peter Appleton(a splendid pre-sixties American name don't ya think?), played solidly by Jim Carrey. He has forgotten his memory and ended up in a town where everyone thinks he's their fabled war hero, a man who hasn't been seen in years.<br />As it turns out, Appleton's new identity brings a new hope to the town, a revitalized attempt to open the old theatre, and one gorgeous blonde hottie. This particular blondie not only possesses a great smile and sense of humor, but also the make-out drive of a pre-sixties(the time period when the film was set) porn star, thus making Petey a very, very happy disillusioned young man.<br />This is where the film needed a huge make-over. It's right before Petey boy dicovers that his \\"girl friend\\" is a complete hottie. I think the director should have taken a twisted turn here, rather deciding to go with a monsterous mule of a woman as the mystery girl. Wouldn't it be fun to have Peter Appleton discover that his old \\"girlfriend\\" is actually Betty The Hefty Horse Woman, a woman with three teeth missing, a lazy eye, and enough arm hair to fill a tanker truck? How fun it would have been for Betty to bring Peter home to meet his forgotten offspring at the carnival, Joey the Jugglin Boy and MaGee, the \\"Twisted Tater Tot\\" girl who gets her thrills form eating peanut butter naked under the pale moon light. But wait, don't stop there, we'd also have to include, for the seriousness of the film, the one-eyed demented sister of Betty, Abbey the Goat Girl, the one they keep locked in the basement for the safety of the townsfolk. Now that, my friends, would have been a great plot line. A film that would no doubt counter its nemesis, Memento, in an epic battle for the most honest movie of the memory loss genre.<br />But, that's not how the direction of the film went. Instead, we get to see Peter Appleton end up in Leave-it-to-Beaver-land USA, practically engaged to a beautiful woman and the son of the sweetest old man since The Shawshank Redemption's Brooks, the book keeper. One can only wonder how the blonde woman has stayed single for so long. Folks, we're talking years here, not months.<br />To top it all off, we get to hear Jim Carrey do a modern rendition of Bill Pullman's Independence Day \\"We Will Not Go Quietly In The Night\\" speech. Oh, the joy of it all.<br />Watch this film. Like I wrote earlier, it's not THAT bad, it's just not THAT good either. Take care and in case I don't see ya, good morning, good afternoon, and goodnight! Oops, wrong movie.great plot line.

0140177396|5.0|Steinbeck is at his best in this novel about two men heading out to get jobs and experience love and hate for each other. I liked the dialogue in this novel and the climax was awesome and thrilling! It was unfortunate that the beloved Lennie died but it may have been for the best and Lennie's death proves to be a big controversial issue among readers today and this is a good thing because plots and climaxes that are predictable aren't good yet I never thought that Lennie would die. While it was sad to see him go, it made for a thrilling ending and one that got us to think about ourselves. Read this book!!

0446310786|4.0|Lee's only pulitzer price winning novel is a true classic! Lots of good characters and a nice plot filled with the issues that we're all struggling with today (e.g. racism, flaws in justice, torn relationships, and judgmental people)...I liked how all the characters interacted with each other and stuck by each other except at the part where it came to the trial of Tom Robinson. You have people rooting for him and people wanting him to be punished for a crime he never committed, which divides the line of love and coming together in a realistic way as told by Harper Lee....do read this novel and I assure you you will like it and consider it a well-written classic.

0385474547|2.0|I had to read this book for my senior year in high school and it was not on the reading list for teachers as a mandatory book to read so my teacher chose this book for us to read...I wish she hadn't...I found this book to be the most boring book ever! I had to read the first chapter four times to figure out what was going on! This book is beyond college level to understand..I don't even see how high school teachers could understand this book....half of it is written in another language (thank god they had a index with translations) and the other half is just plain boring! I would rate this at one star however I gave it two, because it does give us a good life lesson in that one mistake made can change your life forever to the point where you do something drastic as Okonkwo figured this out. Other than that, the book is terrible and really hard to understand...I felt this book was too challenging to me with the Ibo language and the way everything was worded put me in a loop. If you have to read this book for school, I suggest you get cliff notes for it or go to gradesaver.com and/or sparknotes.com..I wouldn't recommend this book and don't bother reading it if you have to....you probly won't understand about 80% of what is said.
B0000042MY|4.0|Trevor Jones does a fantastic job on this one, first opening up with a brilliant piece to start the cd.  We are later induldged in tracks three and six, an Irish/Scotish sound that simply ROCKS, to put it modern day terms. It's a powerful piece on it's own and the theme from these songs is worth the price of the cd by themselves. But, as is the case with this score, we get more than we bargained for.  Track #4 is another solid piece and, in order to give Edelman a little credit, track #11 is one of the hallmarks of this score.<br />I must warn you, though, Edelman's tracks sound awfully familiar to the songs from Gettysburg. Wonder if he found inspiration for Gettysburg from The Last Of the Mohicans.
B0000640VN|3.0|Don't you just hate it when Hollywood comes up with an idea for a romantic comedy, gets two likeable stars to play the leads, and then forgets to come up with a decent script?  Oh maybe they make a conscious effort to just forgo one and save some money (especially if they have to shell out a lot for one of the leads).  &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; is just such a movie.<br /><br />The hook is fairly simple.  Leopold (Hugh Jackman), the Duke of Albany, ends up falling off the top of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1876 in pursuit of a mysterious figure (Liev Schriber) and finds himself in the New York City of today.  There he meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), an ad executive who turns out to be the ex-girlfriend of the mysterious figure, one Stuart Besser.  Kate and Leopold fall in love, mainly because they are the title characters and the names of the two actors appear before the title in the credits.  I mean, we understand what she sees in him: he is polite, articulate, and dashingly handsome.  But as near as I can tell he falls in love with her because she is Meg Ryan, so what other possible response could there be?  Then again, she is different from every other woman he has met in his high society days, so maybe there is some notion of chemistry somewhere in there.<br /><br />The time travel aspects of the film barely rise to the level of secondary considerations, which seems to be a big mistake given the premise.  The portal idea is fine (after all, Christopher Reeves &quot;thought&quot; himself back to the past in &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;), but if you are going to take someone from 1876 and put them in the present, you would think they would have more important culture shock moments than encounters with a toaster and the NYC pooper-scooper law (please note, these are separate encounters).  Leopold is apparently the inventor of the elevator, or would have been, if he had not come forward in time.  Somehow this explains why all the elevators in NYC (and one presumes the world) have stopped working.  This is really just a minor plot device that allows us to know when Leopold is coming and going, as well as setting up how Leopold ends up on his own in our brave new world.  But certainly the script does little to explore the scenario it has set up (contrast it with the milk it for everything it is worth approach used in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;).  Time may well be a pretzel, but that is no reason not to try and straighten out this script a bit.<br /><br />This movie seeks to answer that age-old quandary, if a bird and a fish fall in love, where would they build a home?  The happy ending is fairly predictable, although the specific mechanics of how it comes about are pretty much pulled out of a hat (if a time portal is always at the same time and place at one end then why is at the same place but at different times at the other end?)<br /><br />Hugh Jackman's performance carries the film, at least as far as it goes.  Meg Ryan's character seems to be moved by the script rather than motivated to do most of what she does; there is a telling moment early on when she complains that she has wasted her best years on Stephen and he responds unthinkingly but tellingly, &quot;that was your best?&quot;  It is not a funny moment, and it could have provided a key to the character but Kate ends up being nothing more than a career woman who would not mind a Calgon moment of epic proportions.  The audience ends up having to cross-apply their affection for Ryan from &quot;Sleepless in Seattle,&quot; &quot;When Harry Met Sally,&quot; and/or &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; to really develop their rooting interest for the couple.  Actually, I found myself rooting harder for Kate's brother, Charlie (Breckin Meyer) than I did the primary couple.<br /><br />I like romantic comedies.  I have a romantic soul.  I cry at the BEGINNING of &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; when he says, &quot;It doesn't happen twice.&quot;  But the most touching moment in this movie is when two characters who are NOT in the title discover something quite important in a photograph.  You know a romantic comedy is in trouble when the sweetest moment happens with neither of the title characters in the scene.  Add to this the fact that the funniest scene in the film is the outtake version of Bradley Whitford's speech from the climax of the film you find in the deleted scenes section of the DVD and that is just another bad sign.  Bottom line: &quot;Kate &amp; Leopold&quot; might be one of the most disappointing films you see this year.

B000068MFS|2.0|...get that straight right now. Right about the time she has Cusack's character go up the elevator, I said to myself, \\"Has it come to this tragic end? Have men resorted to this foolishness all for the sake of a little hanky panky?\\" In this film, the answer is a resounding: YES!<br />This is the classic chick flick, predictably strown together and containing no honest or real characters. Instead, we see a nutty British gal(Kate Beckinsale) trying to convince an apparently very lonely and desperate young man(John Cusack) that fate decides everything and, \\"if it's meant to be\\", it will be.<br />Hmm, one can only wonder if this little gal from the UK is a full-pledged calvanist.....food for thought. ;-)<br />As for the plot, Cusack quickly becomes obsessed with the girl, and destiny, or fate( I get to two confused), takes over and begins to show its magical powers.<br />One can only predict what happens after watching the first fifteen minutes of this film.<br />Now here's how it should have been: the girl, who is obviously insane from the get-go, convinces the guy that destiny will play its role. Well, so far, so good. The movie and my own views are hand in hand so far....time to take a more psychotic path.....<br />Still my view:<br />The girl, as it turns out, is a sadistic temptress, trying to find her newest innocent male to mess with. The way she does things is she first gets her victims to believe in her phoney destiny mumbo jumbo and when they are totally obsessed with her, she dumps them like a cheap outfit after a Halloween costume party. After she has dumped Cusack, she turns to Richard Gere and instead of dumping him, forces him into marriage by believing he's about to father her baby. Once married, the British chick makes him clean the house in a maids uniform while singing, \\"Ain't No Woman Like The One I Got.\\" Of course, that's just how I would have made the film. After you watch this movie, you can decide which one is better, my plot line or the one they have.<br />Chowy have. <br />Chow
B00005OAIE|4.0|Note: I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option.<br />I didn't know who this guy was until June. Where I was, I don't know, but I am glad I heard his one hit (&quot;No Such Thing&quot;). I got the CD a while later, only to uncover that it's mostly one drawnout song.<br />Sitting at my desk, I had the CD playing, and after about twenty minutes, I was puzzled when I heard the previous song playing. It turned out that the two were more or less identical, with Mayer's guitar occasionally drowning out his lyrics.<br />Personally, I liked Mayer's stuff. It was very into the guitar. Very into closing his eyes when he sang some lyrics. Very into slow, mellow, repetitive themes, with an occasional kick in the middle. (Good example: &quot;No Such Thing,&quot; about two and a half minutes into the song.) Very into singing about himself: he sings about his height, his brother, his age, and his parents in various songs. <br />While it may be appear dull by my above comments, this CD provides you with a nice blend of emotions, ranging from passion; sweet revenge, though not really revengeful; sedateness; and just feeling mellow.<br />Overall, it's a good CD if you appreciate a LOT of guitar.
B00005ATQI|5.0|I mean, he's as psyhchotic in the beginning as he is in the end.  Jack is talking about the people who ate each other in the olden days, a story he is telling to his son on the way to the hotel. His face and voice, however, look and sound just as freaky as they do at the end of the film. It's almost a little too hilarious. <br />The Shining is a masterpiece, a classic, yadda, yadda, you already know since all about since nearly 400 hundred people have already reviewed it. If there is an impossible chance that you know absolutely nothing about this film, you will find a great horror film about the mental breakdown of a man, only in Kubrick's version we can't really begin to see when Nicholson goes nuts. <br />NOTE TO VIEWER: There are a number of hilarious parts in this film, the scene where Nicholson is staring aimlessly out the window for one. There are, as it should be, a few very freaky parts too. Look for the boy going nuts, it's very freaky. Also, the segment about the dead lady in the tub is scary. <br />WATCH THE MAKING OF THE SHINING, it's enough to make you pee your pants in laughter.
0783240236|4.0|As usual for a legendary Alfred Hitchcock film, `The Birds\\" plays on the emotions of fear.  After bumping into a handsome bachelor in a pet-store, Megan Daniels (Tippi Hedren) follows Mitch Brenner to his hometown of Bodega Bay with a gift of two love-birds. The title features a play on words: the two love-birds that Megan brings to Bodega Bay mirror Megan and Mitch as love-birds.  The romantic interest is certainly an element of the plot, as Megan and Mitch are forced to combine their resources against a common enemy.  The human romance is somewhat simplistic and largely based on initial physical attraction, but is actually a minor element in the plot.  But the real interest is in the birds of the feathered kind, and their conflict with mankind.  The arrival of Megan and the love-birds in Bodega Bay coincides with a growing attack by birds of all kinds on humans.  The first ominous sign comes when a lone sea-gull attacks Megan, and then a flock attacks a group of children at a birthday party.  Soon the residents of Bodega Bay are fighting for their lives against waves of bird attacks.<br /><br />The movie begins slowly with comedy, with a gradual suspenseful build-up typical of Hitchcock that ends up in fear and terror.  Slowly the suspense increases, with moments of high drama accompanied by spine-tingling silence.  The only thing disappointing is the rather open and sudden ending, as Mitch and Megan drive away from a house surrounded by birds.  The ending leaves plenty of room for discussion, but is somewhat unsatisfying because it leaves open too many unanswered questions, such as what caused the strange behaviour of the birds in the first place, and what happened once the car got beyond the driveway.  Part of this is deliberate, with Hitchcock leaving the reason for the attacks unexplained to increase the sense of fear in the real world.  An alternate and lengthier ending was considered with a car chase showing the havoc in the town, but was never filmed.  Perhaps the ending owes its abruptness in part to the fact that the story line is based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, adapted by Evan Hunter.  Admittedly, the movie throws away virtually everything from the original story (a highly recommended read by the way!) except the title, the notion of birds attacking people, and the mood of fear.  But Du Maurier's he original concept is brilliant: the idea of bird attacks makes the predictable unpredictable and challenges our complacency.<br /><br />In many subtle ways the sense of fear grows and is increased by the production - such as one memorable instance when Megan is seated on a bench not realizing that flocks of birds are gathering behind her, whereas the audience is fully aware of this fact. Instead of using a musical soundtrack, Hitchcock employed electronic sounds to simulate the chirping of birds and fluttering of wings, to heighten the effect of attack and fear.  The movie was outstanding for its time because of the technical difficulties in shooting superimposed images of birds on an existing film.  This was cutting edge technology in its day, and was pulled off very successfully.  Moreover, because there were no computer tricks possible, the producers had to use cardboard cutouts, paintings, puppets, artificial birds, mechanical birds, and trained birds.  Considering the limitations imposed by the technology of the day, \\"The Birds\\" is a remarkable contribution to the world of movies, and another great feather in Hitchcock's cap.  But it can hardly be regarded as his best, and there are undoubtedly better movies both by Hitchcock and others.  Definitely worth a look, but once is probably enough.aps the ending owes its abruptness in part to the fact that the story line is based on a short story by Daphne Du Maurier, adapted by Evan Hunter.

B00005JHAB|1.0|I decided one day that I would do a good deed. I took nine girls from the my church youth group to go see the Wedding Planner. It was one of the biggest mistakes of my natural born life.<br />Jennifer Lopez is non-involving, and McConauhey, seemingly AWOL since Amistad, is not to be spoken highly of in this film. The plot is simple: Lopez falls for a doctor(McConauhey) and he falls for her. There is a twist, or something like it, though. Lopez is supposed to marry this Italian puppy-dog of a man, a man who I actually rooted for. All seems doomed when........<br />An hour or so later I was left rubbing my eyes and wondering why my feet were sticking to the floor of theatre. I assumed it was soda and candy spills that had created such a sticky mess but upon further review, I decided it was probably some other poor fella who had cried tears of dred and pain as he watched this movie with his wife. Can tears create such a sticky texture? I don't know. Maybe a doctor would know. Let's ask McConauhey...oh wait, he only plays one in this film.....kind of.<br />Lopez is worth the price of admission. No, not in a fantasy sort of way but rather, in a humerous kind of way. Her character is laughable and her acting is second to everyone.<br />Note to haters of the classic-chick-flick-genre, this film will destroy every ounce of masculine hormone your body has ever produced. Unless you're really trying to get your relationship back and a'hoppin, don't watch this.<br />Ladies, this goes for you too. This is not your mother's chick flick. It's not Pretty Woman, My Best Friends Wedding, or even the fearless While You Were Sleeping. This is a code B chick flick, only the kind of chick flick you should watch during those extreme lapses of severe boredom. Please be warned.<br />As for Puppy Dog boy, he is dealt the rawest deal. I liken him to the poor guy from Runaway Bride who is left by Roberts for Richard Gere. I was rooting for the Italian guy in this film but as you'll soon find out, my cheers from the sidelines didn't quite mean success for this poor fella.ind out, my cheers from the sidelines didn't quite mean success for this poor fella.
B00003CXAR|4.0|Amity is a small beach town that thrives on summer tourists, where the Chief of Police's biggest worry are kids practicing karate on neighbourhood fences.  Until a great-white shark arrives and starts killing beach-goers.  His new worry is how to get rid of a man-eating shark.  That's the basic premise of Peter Benchley's famous novel, brought to screen by Steven Spielberg with some major changes to the plot.  The plot consists of two halves: the first half describing the shark threat, and the second half describing the shark hunt.  The first half is the most enjoyable, as director Spielberg evokes a sense of fear from the outset with the gruesome discovery of the remains of a shark victim.  There is a constant and strong sense of impending doom: \\"who will be next?\\"<br />Unlike most modern movies, the fear that \\"Jaws\\" creates is not produced by graphic displays of blood and gore, which are reserved for the conclusion of the shark hunt in the closing stages of the movie.  In fact you don't even see the details of the first attack or the body of the first victim, and very little of the shark or its victims is seen in the first half of the movie.  Rather, splendid directing creates an emotional fear with small and brilliant touches throughout.  After a few false alarms on the beach, we as viewers start seeing the beach-goers as \\"shark bait\\" through the eyes of the Chief of Police and share his fear.  A most memorable scene occurs as the camera pans between him and the swimmers in the surf, and as he reacts first to an apparent shark which turns out to be an elderly swimmer, and then to the screams of a young couple which turn out to be innocent screams of fun.  Similarly, there are other scenes where his wife surprises him as he is looking at a book with pictures of sharks; and where the camera zooms in on a shark attack and pans out to show it is just a killer-shark video game.  Creating chilling fear in this emotional manner by suggestion rather than by sight of explicit gore is a skill that has largely been lost by modern movie-makers.  Fear is evoked more by what you don't see than what you do see.  John Williams impressive score with its recurring shark theme turns up the chills all the higher.<br />The second half of the movie does not quite live up to the promise of the first half, as the shark hunt gets underway, complete with the memorable line \\"You're going to need a bigger boat.\\"  But here two wonderful characters come to the forefront to join the police chief in the quest for the shark: the kooky shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), and the eccentric shark expert Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is humorously and completely impersonal in his passion for sharks.  The conclusion is rather more graphic than a PG rating would suggest, but is quite satisfying.  (The PG rating is overly generous by today's standards, considering the incidences of blasphemy and graphic violence, particularly in the latter half).<br />It's not hard to see why this is a landmark movie continues to stand out more than 25 years after it was made.  It's dated only in that it pictures people with 70s clothes and hair, and an artificial shark produced by 70s technology.  But there is certainly nothing old-fashioned about the sense of terror and suspense it evokes.  It is this spine-tingling atmosphere that has made the chilling story of \\"Jaws\\" an unforgettable classic that will continue to grab viewers by the teeth in years to come.icit gore is a skill that has largely been lost by modern movie-makers.

B00003CXB2|5.0|Directed by David Lean (famous from \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\"), \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" recounts the true story of the British Intelligence officer T.E. Lawrence (d. 1935).  Lawrence was sent to Arabia during the First World War, and successfully operated behind enemy lines to unite various Arab tribes in guerrilla warfare against the Turks.  The movie focuses on Lawrence's fiercely independent and enigmatic spirit, which rebelled against the British regime under which he served, yet enabled him to be successful in his mission.  Lawrence does not share British colonist ambitions in Arabia but has his own agenda.  Lawrence goes against the grain by treating the Arabs with respect, despite their unfamiliarity with the guns, machines and bombs of modern warfare, and successfully forges important alliances with their leaders.  He secures their enduring respect and near religious devotion by risking his life for others, and accomplishing the impossible.  In the end, the question \\"Who are you?\\" is of deep significance: is Lawrence British or is he Arab?<br />Despite the World War I context, the movie doesn't focus on battle scenes, because most of the conflict is psychological or against the elements.  Lawrence's own character struggles and development are the focus, as is his interaction with Arab and British leaders.  But Lawrence's struggle is not only against a human enemy, but also equally against the hostile desert landscape.  With epic cinematography that leaves you feeling the desert wind and heat, viewers feel exposed to the elements as Lawrence was.  The fierce conditions in the desert and wild passions of the Arabs are wonderfully contrasted with the strict military discipline of the British army at their base with their generals sipping tea, and priding themselves in mundane achievements (\\"We've just built a new squash court\\").  There are a few battles scenes, featuring thunderous hooves, rifle shots, and war whoops, in an epic sequences involving thousands of men, camels and horses.  There are also a few scenes of violence and death (including execution, torture, and a massacre) that would be disturbing to children (they were disturbing to Lawrence!).  It was widely believed that Lawrence was homosexual, and there are a couple of aspects in the movie that could be interpreted as having homosexual overtones.  But on the whole the movie is about the man Lawrence, his passions and eccentric personality.  Lawrence's prime character trait was an ego that was bigger than he was, and this arrogant pride eventually destroyed him.<br />The change in Lawrence's character after he is tortured is somewhat sudden and hard to follow, as the man who was previously afraid of blood now shocks his men by ordering them to massacre a column of retreating Turks.  But this aside, it's a wonderful movie with adventure, epic sequences, extraordinary scenery, and good characterization. It still stands up remarkably well after more than 40 years, because never do you have the feeling that you are watching something thoroughly outdated.  Considering that the movie weighs in at well over three and a half hours, it's also lengthy.  Remarkably, there are no girls and no love story, but it works.  Most memorable are portrait of the man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole was relatively unknown prior to this film, but produced an immense performance in the starring role) and the spectacle of the harsh desert scenery (no doubt best viewed on the big screen!).  The passion of the characters, conflicts and cinematography are as powerful today as they were in 1962.  It's no wonder that this movie won seven Academy Awards in its time, and thirty years later is still regarded by many as one of the top ten of all time movie classics.  It may not be entirely accurate in its depiction of the history (the portrayal of Lawrence was sharply criticized by his family, and the depiction of Arabs is somewhat stereotyped).  But even if it's somewhat of a mirage, this classic is worth digging up from the desert of the past to watch all over again.orth digging up from the desert of the past to watch all over again.

0465068359|4.0|It just ain't gonna happen this time.  I happened upon this book when searching for a primer on Chinese history and I figured I'd mix the general with the specific and grabbed both.<br />Well, as you might suspect, I finished this book in a 3 day period and I've barely begun the other book.  I'm not a religious guy, but reading the first half of this book requires a Job-like outlook.  You'll believe human suffering is at its apex and then, wham, you'll hear yet another horrific story involving a partial beheading, a mass public immolation, or weapon-forced incest.  Ms. Chang at her best when she chronicles  the horrors found via diary or interview.  While she's a tad polemical, these silent victims dramatically need their polemicist.<br />Why only 4 stars?  Ms. Chang's work on the broader picture--the cultural, political, and organizational causes of the massacre and its \\"non-issueness\\" after the war--wasn't compelling.  If you wanna understand why the Japanese Army did what it did, you're gonna need to look somewhere else.  If you wanna understand why Japanese society works so hard to deny the massacre, ya gotta look somewhere else.  If you wanna understand how a disciplined organization turned into a Sierra Leone-like thugs, it's somewhere else.
0743455967|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading Steven King's book, On Writing, and found it compelling, entertaining, and informative.  This lively book is divided into three sections: his life before becoming a successful writer, wonderful, practical advice on writing fiction, and a chilling depiction of his near fatal accident caused by a drunk driver.<br />My wife and I laughed so hard at the Pow Incident that tears - but no sounds - came out.  I was delighted to gain so many insights into the experiences that affected King's life and his novels.  I was unaware of his addiction to cigarettes, alcohol, and drugs or poverty as a child and an aspiring writer.<br />Although King asserts that integrity is the basis of all effective writing, I thought he equivocated at least once in the book.  Presumably, his addictions cost money, but King says he was too poor to purchase medicine his little girl need for chronic ear infections.  Did she go without while he did not?  King does not tell us.<br />Despite this lapse, the book is an excellent read and a fresh outlook on an otherwise dull subject.  I look forward to using some of its lessons in my high school English classes or putting them into practice the next time I publish.<br />New to me was King's advice on quotation attribution, which he says is the same as giving stage directions.  His point is a good one: the character should speak in such a way that the reader understands the delivery is terse, angry, nervous, etc.  Let the verb summarize the manner.<br />By so doing, the writer says more by saying less, meaning that adding an adverb after the quotation is unnecessary.<br />This book serves two audiences well: published writers and would be.  There is much to be mined in it.
B000002U84|4.0|Ah, the songs that Duran Duran's best videos are taken from.  This contains several top singles that you probably think of when you hear \\"Duran Duran\\" such as \\"Rio\\", \\"Save a Prayer\\" and \\"Hungry like the Wolf\\".  The songs not released as singles are even better is you like lyrics that challenge your mind and melodies that are a bit darker than the average pop song.

It is so nice to hear her sing out in full voice for a change.  To be honest, I've always found her, in the bel canto operas, to be a crashing bore.  Of course, she always sings everything perfectly with, (what sounds to me) a mouth full of oatmeal.  Anyway, she sings Turandot for all it's worth.  I love it.  Not to slight the others in the cast, they are all in spactactular voice; however, Dame Joan is truly the star!  I perfer this Turandot to all others.  I own many recordings of the opera; but, this one I listen to over and over again.  To me, Joan out sings any of the heavy-duty dramatic sopranos including Nilsson.

B00000JZI9|4.0|Silverado is one of the best of the modern westerns. At a time when westerns were out of favor in Hollywood, Lawrence Kasden (writer of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) wrote and directed this 'feel-good' western. It's not the gritty western of Leone or Eastwood's Unforgiven, but more like a John Ford/John Wayne western of the 40s and 50s. There is a lot of killing, but no gratuitous violence, and none of it glorified. It has a huge cast (though Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Kevin Costner, and Danny Glover are the principal actors) with some great performances, and many that are surprising. John Cleese has a surprisingly good role, and this is one of Costner's better roles, before he became too big for himself. It is shot beautifully (out in New Mexico). The score is huge and wonderful. They built the largest 'western' town to make this movie. And the opening sequence is a good one. <br />There is no commentary on the dvd, but it does have a really good making of documentary. Anyone who wishes to make a making of documentary should watch this one to see how it is done. <br />I can't say that this movie is for everyone, but if you like westerns at all, this one will take you back.
B000002U8A|5.0|Back in the days when Duran Duran's music and videos told stories -- how I miss those days.  This is an amazing album because the stories are all creepy and intense, examining the struggle to fame, fortune, and connectiveness.  Once more, I think the non-singles on the album are better than those you could hear on the radio in the 1980s.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick--there are very few directors who rank up there with him. This is Kubrick's best movie, and I'd definitely put it in the top five ever made. It's a dark satire, with stellar performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden. And Peter Sellers' performance in all three of his roles is one of the best I've seen. It's shot in black & white, and very beautiful. And of course in a Kubrick film, everything means something. Unfortunately it isn't a widescreen edition, and there is no commentary, but those are the only faults I can find. There's a short documentary on Kubrick's shorts and early films. There's a pretty good documentary on the Making of Dr. Strangelove. The animated menu is done simply and brillaintly. It has the original theatrical trailor for the film, which was pretty cutting edge. Also there is the trailer for Fail Safe, and for some reason they threw in the trailer for Anatomy of a Murder, though I don't really see why. Even the case it comes in is elegantly designed. This is a dvd you definitely want to get, and a movie that should be watched over and over. Definitely in the top five ever made (along with Citizen Kane, Casablanca, North by Northwest, and Fight Club).
B000002V1D|4.0|Actually, this album has no title at all!  Most of the songs are politically challenging on this album and I loved it!  The sexual imagery is hot and intense, the music is classical Duran Duran.

B0000683U7|4.0|I purchased the DVD box set with high expectations.  Instead, I received something that appeared more like WB slapping left overs together for $$$.  The DVD is what you can purchase in the store.  Don't get me wrong, the movie and the DVD are great - I am a die hard Hitchcock fan.  The contents of the box set in my opinion are not woth the money.  The 8x10s and mini Lobby Cards appear as screen captures - fuzzy.  The poster is folded real compact and is blurry as well.  I was really hoping the DVD would have extra content from the \\"regular\\" version on the market.  I just feel WB could have done better with a movie such as this!

The music is danceable and yet provokative in many ways -- nothing explicit but very suggestive.  Even with only 3 of the original 5 members, this is one of Duran Duran's best collections.  It shows a good deal of maturity after the first split.

I don't expect them to keep the &quot;same old style&quot; from past CDs.  I will allow any artist to experiment.  The issue I have with this CD is the lack of passion, effort.  The overall effect is a sleepy, bland album that is not offensive, but also not motivating.  As in the fact that I was not motivated to listen to the CD more than twice.  Actually, I was motivated once by the CD -- to sell it!

B00003CX8N|5.0|This is a wonderful film.  No violence. No swear words. No blood and gore.  Instead you have a fantastic film about post-war Britain and America and the relationship between Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins) in England and Helen Hanif in America(Anne Bancroft.  He works in a bookshop in Charing Cross Road in London, she is a brash New Yorker with a passion for old books.  Their relationship is purely platonic, he is happily married, but their friendship blossoms and for many years Helen and Frank correspond with each other as she increases her old book collection and the Post War Countries they reside in slowly head for modern times.<br />The story follows the lives of Frank, the staff at the bookshop, Helen in New York and a variety of amusing incidents that will have you laughing and crying in the same breath.  Anthony Hopkins is delightful as the gently pompous Frank and Anne Bancroft breathes life into her character Helen, funny, very Jewish and very tactless.<br />With Post-War austerity severe in Britain Helen sends American food packages to her new friends who recieve them with delight.  One funny moment is when Helen realises that the owners of the bookshop Frank works in are Jewish and that she has just sent a huge ham to them!  Frantically she writes to Frank, explaining though she is Jewish herself, she isn't orthodox and that she hopes his employers aren't too horrified with half a pig turning up on their doorstep!  I had to chuckle at that.<br />This is a delightful film, and well worth buying as you can watch it again and again.  The book it is based on is very good too, well worth reading as it has all the letters that went between Frank and Helen during their many years of correspondence.
B00005KHJR|4.0|Filmed in the Summer Isles, this is amazingly chilly. An excellent horror film that doesn't need to use buckets of blood or amries of mutants - in other words its suspensful.<br />In saying that I should add that the film is well worked out and has a very clever twist at the end.<br />Christopher Lee shows he can be menacing without fangs. Edward Woodward is excellent as the pious Christian policeman sent out to the Summer Isles to investigate a missing-girl report - to discover an island that has regressed to pre-Christian religion.<br />A gorgeous bawdy publican's wife (Britt Ekland -aka Mrs Peter Sellars) tries to seduce him.<br />Will the stalwright policeman give into licentiousness?<br />Probably would have been better if he did!
0316666343|3.0|Expectations sometimes work against a book, and that probably was the case with me.<br />This book is written from the viewpoint of a murdered girl, Susie Salmon.  And, her viewpoint is sad and touching, violent and scary, and funny and wistful.  I found her part, very engrossing.<br />But, I thought Ms. Seybold resorted to stereotypes, and things we've seen and read before, for the rest of the characters.  The father's anger and behavior is understandable, but expected.  And, what does the grieving wife and mother do?  The same here, as in many of those other sad and meaningful? books.  Then there is the wise grandmother, the weird friends. <br />And Susie returns to earth, to do what?  She was 14 years old when she was murdered.<br />Finally, the ending wasn't one I would hope for.  Too neat and quick a resolution, for me.
B000002UAO|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" was some of the same and something different.  \\"Rubber Soul\\" yielded the first Beatles hit song that had nothing to do with love or girls (\\"Nowhere Man\\").  \\"Rubber Soul\\" marked a transition from The Beatles early boy band love songs to a mature sound that could cover any subject well.<br />The songs on this album are classic mid-60s.  \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"Drive My Car\\", each classics Beatles songs that are staples of classic rock stations.  \\"You Won't See Me\\" in particular has been covered numerous times by other groups.<br />\\"Nowhere Man\\" is excellent.  A song about everyman, and a commentary on everyman.  This song with its political overtones perhaps expressed some of the frustration the youth of the 60s had with the desire to change the world, and yet couldn't get the oldsters to understand what they were about, and changes that happened were too slow.  It's funny looking back, because now we are the oldsters, and the wheel has turned once again.  The most incredible thing about this song is that it has nothing to do with love, and ranks as one of the best Beatles songs of all time.  The only flaw with this song is that it, like so many other songs of the era, was a paltry 2:44 long, which was LONG by the standards of those days.  Think of what The Beatles could have done had they had CD's to work with!<br />I think \\"Michelle\\", \\"Girl\\", \\"In My Life\\" are excellent Beatles ballads, with outstanding harmonies on \\"Girl\\" and \\"In My Life\\".  Classics in a different vein from the other songs on this album.<br />Of the remaining songs, \\"Think for Yourself\\", \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", \\"Wait\\", and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" offer quality Beatles music.  Each of these are harbingers of The Beatles that would see one more transition album, \\"Revolver\\", followed by the revolution in rock music, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".<br />\\"The Word\\" is very 60s pop music, with little to distinguish it other than it is a Beatles song.  \\"What Goes On\\" is an interesting song for The Beatles in that it has a country flavor with Ringo taking the lead vocal.  Clearly the idea of a concept album was yet to come.  \\"Run for Your Life\\" finishes off the CD with some novelty.  The \\"end\\" in the song is pronounced \\"end-uh\\", matching the music well.  Note that in written lyrics this is written as \\"end-a\\".<br />The album is a little uneven in a couple of places.  Following \\"Think for Yourself\\" with \\"The Word\\" is not a smooth transition.  Similarly, following \\"Michelle\\" with \\"What Goes On\\" causes \\"What Goes On\\" to grate somewhat.  Perhaps the biggest flaw with this excellent CD is that the order of the songs could have been changed to have some flow to the style and mood of the songs.  However, as I noted earlier, the concept album was two years away.<br />The flaws in this CD are minor.  The music proved once again that even with small bumps in quality, The Beatles were consistently able to fill an album with good to great songs.  This album is a must have for any fan of mid-60s rock, and definitely for any fan of The Beatles.is an interesting song for The Beatles in that it has a country flavor with Ringo taking the lead vocal.

0446310786|5.0|This book is so well written that I feel like I want to memorize at least half of the 250+ pages.<br />Atticus seems to be perfect to be true yet probably everyone knows a few Atticus -- men/women who are normal but great.  I know a few and realized after reading this book that they're such treasured friends.<br />As a parent, Atticus is a great model of parents who are trying to raise independent, righteous, brave...childen.  I'm going to send this book to my best girlfriend who is about to deliver a baby.<br />I seldom finish up a novel and almost never collect books.  But this book will be with me until I can memorize it.
B00005NB8J|5.0|This is one of the best Sci-Fi films I have ever seen. The story revolves around an Egyptologist (played brilliantly by James Spader) who is recruited by the military to help unravel the secret of an ancient artifact (the Stargate). Once he solves the mystery, he and a team of soldiers (led by Kurt Russell), enter the Stargate (a portal to other worlds), and find a society of people who appear to be descendants of the ancient Egyptians. They worship gods (including Ra the Sun God), who in reality, are an alien race. Jaye Davidson (of THE CRYING GAME) gives a stellar performance as Ra. Once our heroes figure out Ra's scheme to destroy Earth, they set out to turn the tables on him. It all adds up to a fascinating film that is visually stunning, and leaves the viewer pondering the possibility that maybe the ancient gods were in fact aliens. A great 2 hrs. of entertainment.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a relaxing and soothing CD.  I think it is most enjoyable and what I need to hear to unwind.
0767830555|5.0|The details are vivid and ugly, and, that is what makes this film so intoxicating. The photography is brilliant and fluid, creating a buffer for this grim, pale, transient life. Bernard Herman's score is chilling, making DeNiro's Travis Bickle all the more intimidating. It's like watching a book. A  book by Charles Bukowski, or some other skid row beat. Scorsese is absolutley on top of his game here, sacrificing nothing, to bring the characters full circle. One of the best films ever made. Full of life, dirt and nuanced character portrayls by Harvey Keitel, Jodie Foster, and DeNiro, who burns through the screen like a subdued meteor. Perfect.
0393317552|5.0|Oh, there is no bad character, no deviation inherently wrong such as an entire society turning to cannibalism, and oh, there is no good character either, no blessed trait such as a love of book learning with the power to transform an entire society.  No, there is only geography and the luck of the draw in regards to the temperament of your beasts or the usefulness of your plants.<BR>There is no evolution, or any changes in the characteristics of the men who inhabit this simpleton's world, alas, and thus a certain validity of one reviewer's comments that, why not? A billion years ago?<BR>There is no right, and there is no wrong, just the gray area that allows the rich to pick and choose the causes most profitable for them and the author to pick and choose the reasons most beneficial for their secret agenda, not plainly stated, be it then not secret, like duh.<BR>If you look deeply enough perhaps you will see the destruction of our moral philosophy that lies in this denial of right and wrong.  This denial of good or bad.  This gray area that can be no other than the moral philosophy of some murderer or thief.  And if you look even deeper, perhaps you will see the horror and degeneration of the modern world in this religion of gray area, heralded by a corrupt academia and their culture of hate, driven by their own special interests and not by those of man.<BR>I am not some cultural racist, some white supremacist, these ideas of moral philosophy that I value so highly come not from northern Europe, but from Italy during the renaissance in the works of Michelangelo and Dante and from Israel during the time of Christ, and who knows perhaps from Egypt or Persia before then.  I care not what race it is when I see goodness and not evil.  And I care not what race it is when I see evilness and not good - such as when I see savage cannibalism abandoned for ritual cannibalism but a few years later in New Guinea.<BR>What geographical boundary is it that prevented knowledge of thewritten word, which need pass only once?  What demon is it that has blessed us with a world that, conveniently, has no responsibility beside that of the hills, the beasts, or the plants?<BR>When every other reviewer strongly states that they now see how the world has progressed without regard to race, there can be no other implication then that either they thought this before, or more likely, that this is what they accuse someone else of thinking, this slander of others, this accusation of, dare I say a witch, this culture of hate.  Do not turn your blind eye in that case: this book is about race, accusation and hatred and nothing other.<BR>This book is not just wrong, no, I will say that it is evil.
0780622650|1.0|Lost In Space? Seen it? You must be at least interested in it for some reason or another since you are on this web page. I advise you right now, drop this movie from all consideration if you value your time and money...and your sanity. Don't make the mistake of watching this, or, even worse, buying it. What a terrible thought. <BR>I saw this back when it came out with the thought that at least the special effects would be good. I was wrong. Why I didn't turn this pondscum off after five minutes I'll never know. Maybe I held on to hope that this waste of a movie would eventually get more interesting. I was wrong again. The worst part of this movie, the absolute worst part was the introduction of that strange monkey like cursed creature that made Jar Jar Binks look like a Harvard Graduate. Matt Leblanc, Desperate to get out of his 'Friends' stereotype, should have been nicknamed 'Woody' in this.<BR>Meaning, He could do a better job of shoveling Elephant manure  (With respect to the elephant) then acting. At least in this (actually come to think of it, in any of his movies).<BR>Actually, nobody is acting in this. More like trying to act.<BR>But I think you get the general idea.
B0000013G9|4.0|OK, OK.  I'm way too old to be listening to this.  I mean, at some point in your life, you just say to [heck] with trying to keep up and just put on an old Who album, crank it up full blast and pop open a light beer or an Ensure...unless of course, you happen to be Robert Christgau, but that's another story.<br />Well, after I learned that Lisa \\"Left Eye\\" Lopes had died in the Honduran jungle, I was intrigued enough to pick this up...used, at my local ... records shop.  (Sorry! But hey, it was  only 99 cents!).  At first, I didn't care much for it, I must admit.  I was reminded of what I didn't like about much of current so-called r'n'b, primarily that it tries so hard to be both mechanical and sensual at the same time. Imagine a robot experiencing orgasm.<br />But actually, it's not that bad.  Not bad at all really once you get past the conventions.  At least one of the girls (Chilli?) can really sing, and the others are at least good stylists.  I gather from reading the notes above that TLC was something of a pre-fab group, which is another thing that with advancing age, you don't get so upset about.  (Hey, I remember the Monkees--and now I find that I remember them FONDLY, something I never would have foreseen at age 14).<br />So anyway!  I do like this record.  I like the sinewy vocals and the imaginative arrangements. That's probably a synthesizer on \\"Take Our Time\\" for instance, but it sounds like psychedelic late 60s guitar (a la Spirit) to my ancient ears. The rapping is \\"rap-lite,\\" which is fine with me.  (But the late \\"Left Eye\\" did have a way with words, to be sure.) Lapses into silliness and bad taste occur from time to time in the various interludes.  I won't be giving anything away, I trust, if I comment that's it's never exactly sublime humor to include the sound of a flushing toilet on a record that is, after all, meant to be played over and over.  Oh, that's right, you young whippersnappers probably know how to program that out.  Damned if I won't have to learn that. Right after I figure out how to get my VCR to stop flashing 12:00 A.M.<br />Which leads to the other drawback re: this lengthy, chock full delight!  It's so long I almost never make it too the end without falling asleep.  I've reached the point where I can sing(and rhyme) right along with \\"Creep\\" or \\"Waterfalls\\"...but I can't even tell  you what \\"Sumthin Wicked This Way Comes\\" even sounds like.  But I'll get to it one of these days.<br />One of my younger acquaintances complained about the song \\"Waterfalls\\" by the way.  What kind of message was that? she opined.  \\"Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to???\\"  Like, oh, we can go out and conquer the world and lead adventurous, tres chi-chi lives, but you folks back home, you just stick to the backwaters.  And then elsewhere on the album they're complaining about all the \\"fake people in <their> life\\" who are just envious hangers-on.  Well, if you'd let them find their own [darn] waterfalls to chase, maybe they wouldn't have to seek their reflections in yours, ladies.  (If I may be permitted to strain a metaphor myself!)<br />Anyway, I may be over-interpreting.  We all embody a lot of contradictions and TLC is  (was?) no exception.  It's OK. You can be CrazySexyCool and cagey, and funny and likeable and a little goofy from time to time too.  That's the great thing about (post)modern life.
B000069HKH|3.0|Alas, I suppose it's too much to hope for a return to the more complex Springsteen, the artist who produced 'Darkness on the Edge of Town', or the masterpiece 'The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle'. This latest offering, a 'response' in a sense to Sept 11, is long on sincerity but short on creativity. <BR>In fact, it's pretty formulaic. The songs, by and large, are standard rock songs with lots of repeated refrains, short stanzas of rather unimaginative verse, and plenty of guitar energy and emotion. <br />Once upon a time, Springsteen described the nation through complex stories, wild lines of rock n roll rhyme, memorable characters, and hunger. These days, sadly, most of that is gone. His heart's in the right place, he has more integrity than 99% of those 'artists' who make up the rock industry, but he doesn't take any risks on 'The Rising' and, as a result, the album is pretty unrealized.

B00000099Y|1.0|This is music? This torrid piece of filth could well be the 90s answer to Emerson, Lake and Palmer. There is not a trace of intelligence in any lyric, the music is merciless sludge, and the album consists mainly of filler. <BR>I know, because I've listened to it many times. This is one of my friend's favorites, for whatever reason, and she saw fit to make me listen to it. In fact, she saw fit to make me STUDY it. So I listened to each song multiple times and analyzed her printed lyrics. I came to the conclusion that it was almost entirely without worth. THEN I got to listen to the entire 76 minute torturous sprawl. Several times. (All for you, I! Never say I'm not a true friend. I even tried my best to like your favorite parts!)<BR>&quot;Eulogy&quot; (which is decent for what it is) says it best for Mr. Keenan and his merry band: &quot;He had a lot of nothing to say.&quot;
B000069HP6|3.0|Disney's THE BLACK HOLE was it's first entry into the sci-fi genre in 1979. It is basically a thinly veiled 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA space opra.  The special effects and art direction for its time are very impressive. However, the story and script is slow and meandering with part of the ending a little vague borrowing from a certain Stanley Kubrik sci-fi classic and leaving the audience to ponder. A group of space scientists/ explorers (with a hovering cute little robot named Vincent) discover a black hole and a mystery ship hovering at its outer rim.  They investigate and find out it's helmed by a mad scientist (Maximilian Schell) with a robot \\"henchman\\"  Maximillian, and an army of android drones who may or may not be human. Then, the scientists discover that he wants to venture into the black hole etc. On the big screen, it worked okay.  On the small screen network broadcasts with commercial interruptions, editing, and pan and scan it breaks down considerably.  Now on DVD with widescreen, it works a little better. The cast is top notch with Robert Forster(JACKIE BROWN, ALLIGATOR), the beautiful Yvette Mimieux (HIT LADY), Anthony Perkins (PSYCHO), Ernest Borgnine, and the voices of Roddy McDowell (PLANET OF THE APES) for \\"Vincent\\" the robot, and Slim Pickens (1941, DR STRANGELOVE) for \\"Bob\\" the robot. Somewhat entertaining for the visuals, but somehat lacking in popcorn action and script.

6304493681|5.0|I just noticed that someone who reviewed this film mistakingly thought that this film is the imitation of the matrix ..... Just to let you know, this film was released in 1995 and the matrix was released in 1999.... So if you think they resemble, it should be the matrix that imitates this film. Personally, I think both of them are great and are based on totally different philosophical principles. Both of them are philosophical, seemingly influenced by different principles. The title &quot;ghost in the shell&quot; is very similar to &quot;ghost in the machine,&quot; which is said by some behavioristic philosopher who denies the existence of the mind. They thought that the mind is equal to the brain. They support the view that only what we can see is true. On the other hand, the matrix seems to be influenced by skepticism, which support the view that we never know whether things we see is true. Anyway, I just wanted to say that ghost in the shell came earlier than the matrix.

More like the cacaphonic mess of Mr Steve Howe.<br />The brass section of the orch. is also wildly out of tune in too many places for my liking.<br />On the other hand Tom Brislin?,Alan White & Jon are very good.<br />Another thing,the opening harmony vox on DONT GO are certainly prerecorded,not on!<br />These guys need Steve Morse or Trevor Rabin.
0684853523|5.0|Why should Stephen King write a how-to book? It's a question he wondered himself before creating \\"On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.\\"<br />King talks candidly about his childhood, early writing ventures and even his highs and lows along the way. One of the best sections of this book is King's account of Carrie. From his early ideas to breaking into publishing success, his own life story is just as much of a page-turner as his 30+ bestsellers. <br />Whether you dabble in writing or you're a published author, anyone who writes fiction can learn from this book. The \\"On Writing\\" and \\"Toolbox\\" sections are an invaluable learning guide to writing your own compelling fiction. <br />King shows you how to really draw in your readers, writing with action and playing on emotions. And he doesn't leave out the power of dialogue either. <br />You don't have to be a die-hard Stephen King fan to enjoy this book. He doesn't hang an ego on every printed page. It's just straight talk about his life and writing with no self-serving nonsense. <br />Approximately 40 pages from the end of the book, depending on which version you're holding, you'll find \\"On Living: A Postscript.\\" This postscript takes you step-by-step through the accident that almost claimed King's life. His determination to live and his doubts about ever writing again are both moving and inspiring. If he can recover, mentally and physically, to get back on the writing track, you can write your novel too.

B000066F6H|4.0|I'm telling you people, if you like punk (and I mean REAL punk, none of this Blink-182ish garbage) than this is an album that you simply have to own. The Hives perform a very old-school style of punk. Loud, fast and raw! These guys are definetely the pride of their homeland Sweden (and that country really needs some pride after they gave us ABBA [ewwww!]).<br /> Almost every track on this album is quality, but usually under two minutes. It's not a very long album (clocking in at around 28 minutes), but you will enjoy most of it.<br /> A few of the stand-outs on this album would (of course) be the first single, \\"Hate to say I told you so\\". The cathcy rhyme of the verse and the rapid fire outro definetly portray singer Pelle Almqvist talent as a singer (even if he does tend to squeak more than a mouse being beaten by a squirrel).<BR>Another would be the fourth track, \\"Main Offender\\". Hopefullly this will be thier next single. Like \\"Hate to say I told you so\\", \\"Main offender\\" is just a bit slower than the rest of the album, but considering the rest of the tracks, that isn't very slow at all! The guitar work is very fluid with the vocals, and Pelle Almqvist vocal talent still shines, but also STILL squeaks<BR>more than a chipmunk ging thru puberty!<br />Other stand-outs include the VERY slightly industrial feel of \\"Supply and Demand\\". The lightning fast \\"Metric System in Time\\", and the very mosh-worthy \\"Die, Alright\\". But thier is one big flaw in Veni Vidi Vicious. It's a song called \\"Find Another Girl\\". What were there guys smoking when they wrotte this song. It's a doo-wop, cornball song about falling in love and getting your heart broken. It sounds like a Buddy Holly track played on Telecasters. This album would be perfect if not for this single...basket of a track.<br /> Veni Vidi Vicious does have flaws (*cough* findanothergirl *cough*), but what album doesn't. I would recommend this album to anyone. Go buy this album, I ASSURE you, you won't regret it!<br />Untilnext time,<BR> Hip Hip Hooray! Nice, Nice! Yah-Boo! ...

The melodies are sweet and catchy.  <br />The album contains many moving notable ballads suchs as underneath your clothes and the less known Poem to a Horse.  <br />Laundry is one of the best Pop albums of 2002 and would make a welcome addition to any Latin Pop fan's collection.
B00000JR2A|5.0|TFF are the best band in the entire world! The Big Chair made TFF my favorite band of all time. However the album that made TFF my favorite band in the world for good is this one, The Seeds Of Love. <br />SOL is the most incredible, most colorful album that I've ever heard from a rock band. It's hard to believe that the mechanical sounding Big Chair and the soul-rock sounding Seeds Of Love are by the same band. <br />My favorites are ever so wonderful Advice For The Young At Heart the Gospel tinged Standing On The Corner of The Third World, &amp; the eight &amp; a half minute jazzy blues-rock influenced Badmans Song. <br />Go out and by this CD. It's so worth the money and buy the remastered edition with the four bonus tracks. It's so worth the money.
B00005NKCM|4.0|I am going to wait and find out from others if Season 4 and 5 are as poorly transfered as Season 1,2, and 3.  I am not sure what &quot;bmd&quot; June 9 2002 is talking about. All 3 Seasons have masking, freezing and sounds of the cameras churning and the Dolly moving around the room. These are priceless and should have been handled in a better way. Recently I purchased Brideshead Revisited, on the DVD they said the original copy was in poor quality. They spent months getting the quality up to speed for those of us that watch DVD format as a superior viewing experience. But  &quot;bmd&quot; is right about one thing, the stories are wonderful and even though I don't get a fluid viewing experience I will make due till A/E either cleans these previous DVD's up, then I will re-purchase them. This applies to DVD ONLY. 4 Stars for story, minus 1 for horrible, tacky, poorly executed video transfer to DVD.

Davey Johnstone is all over this album with fantastic guitar fills.Well produced, well played, and well written they rarely make 'em like this anymore.As far as bonus tracks go, where is House Of Cards, the b-side of Someone Saved My Life Tonight?
B00005QCYC|4.0|This series was fairly good! The thing that made it bad was the 3rd movie! Everything I wanted to happen in the 3rd one, didn't happen! I was hoping the T-Rex would win and still be the bad guy. But no, it's some stupid dinosaur that one. T-Rex rules! Which is why the 1st two were good. <br /> 1st- They get stuck on a island with dinosaurs! Reality, no, but that's what makes it fun! The acting is good, special effects were okay, but that doesn't make the movie. But it also had a good plot, which held the movie together, and is why I liked the movie.<br /> 2nd- Better than the first, but there's always room for improvement. This one's funnier and better entertainment, I loved it! This one's the best, compared to what some people think!<BR> <BR> 3rd- Terrible, their suppose to get better, not worse! They depend on special effects in this one too much, just like Lord Of The Rings. But this was 2x worse! Skip it! Save your money and maybe if you're really bored one day and can waste an hour and a half, watch it, but don't bother if you don't like cheesy dinosaurs and dull characters!<br />  Overall, the movies were fairly good, but the 3rd needs alot of work. The 1st and the 2nd were good and will always be, Jurassic Park forever!!
6305364613|2.0|What a pity I have yet to see a film version of Romeo and Juliet I wholeheartedly appreciate (is there a Branagh in the house?).  And what a pity that an earnest attempt to update Shakespeare and make him more accessible to younger audiences was ruined by being overly-symbolic, stock representationalism, and a rather large miscasting job.  <br />Luhrmann's vamped-up locale actually seemed rather interesting when I first heard about it.  It even seemed to come off as being pretty decent in some of the scenes (I particularly liked Mercutio's death scene), but pretty soon, the constant reminder that we're in GenX California began to wear thin on my patience.  Likewise, the abundant decor that is used, particularly in Juliet's bedroom, reaches the point of suffocation and taking away from the scene.  Perhaps, however, the most redeeming part to Luhrmann's lavishness, is the Capulet's ball where it works rather convincingly.  Divine decadence.  <br />Probably the highlight of the movie is Harold Perrineau Jr's Mercutio.  Perrineau has a firm understanding of his character and the ability to shift him from the mid 1500s to the late 1900s.  Not quite the easy task, as we notice seeing Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes playing the title characters.  While I have seen both turn out fine performances (Celebrity and Little Women come to mind), they performed their Shakespearian roles with the comprehension of a third rate high school performance.  They seem to have some understanding of how others performed their roles, and went on those performances in an attempt to be convincing.  Unfortunately, it didn't work for me.  And perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie much more had they been re-cast.  <br />If anything can be said for this film, it's that since its opening, there has been a greater interest in the Bard in younger people, which I suppose is a good thing.  I agree with a previous reviewer who said that not only do they go in and see the film, but they understand it.Albeit it's a rather misconstrued version, it's something, right?  Right?  <br />Well, perhaps we can hope teens use it as a stepping stone to Branagh.
B00005Y228|5.0|I will say it right now.  I am not a big dance music fan, I HATE cheesy Europop.  But I can honestly say this is a great album.  I'd downloaded a few songs and nothing really caught my attention.  Then months later I listened to them again and decided to give the album a try.  Surprise, I love mostly ALL the songs!  It's upbeat dance music, always puts me in a good mood and makes me want to get on the dance floor.  Nothing too deep, just fun music.  Kylie doesn't have the most powerful voice but for this music, she hardly needs it.  She doesn't waste her time with syrupy sweet ballads that make people want to wretch.  Everything is fast and catchy, even dipping into techno now and again.  My review of the songs (on a scale of 1-4)<br /> 1.More More More-Great song to start off the album.  Very cathcy and gets you into a good mood (3)<BR> 2.Love At First Sight-This is sorta of a laid back dance song, it's really pretty.  It reminds you of how you felt when you first fell in love with someone.  Some of the better lyrics on the album. (4)<BR> 3.Can't Get You Out Of My Head-Great song.  Not quite as good as the latter but I think the cool futuristic video helps it in my mind. (4)<BR> 4.Fever-This is a good song, clever play on words. (3)<BR> 5.Give It To Me-One of my favorites, it's very Britney Spears.  Fun shout-along chorus. (4)<BR> 6.Fragile- Personally I think this is one of the worst songs on the album.  It's too slow, she should have put one of the bonus tracks in place of this. (1)<BR> 7.Come Into My World-This song is pretty good.  Not really a standout track but sorta eases it's way into your head. (3)<BR> 8.In Your Eyes-Not one of my favorites.  A little too monotone. (2)<BR> 9.Dancefloor-Probably the best song on the album.  Disco at it's best, good lyrics, she did a great job with this one. (4)<BR>10.Love Affair-This is a really good song.  The chorus is really catchy! (3)<BR>11.Your Love-This song doesn't really stand out to me but it's better than Fragile. (2)<br />12.Burning Up-This is a pretty good song.  It's upbeat on the chorus but the verses are slow.  Love how it speeds up. (3)<BR>13.Get Up-This is one of the bonus songs, it's pretty good.  I particularly like the &quot;Come on get your hands up!&quot; line. (3)<BR>14.Butterfly-This is an awesome song, I think it should have replaced 'Fragile' personally.  Great sing a long lyrics, especially the bridge that is repeated throughout the song. (4)<br />Overall, great album.  Worth every penny and I can't wait to check out her Light Years CD and some of her other stuff.  Although in the states it will be sorta hard to find.
B00003CWPL|5.0|To all of my friends who say that LOST HIGHWAY AND MULHOLLAND DRIVE are so weird, I have one thing to say to you. \\"Watch ERASERHEAD.\\" Lynch's first masterpiece that introduced him (gradually) to the world is a stunningly bizarre work of art, not cinema, but art, that makes BLUE VELVET look like a mainstream summer blockbuster by comparison.<br />Lynch regular Jack Nance plays Henry, a mild mannered young man who lives quietly in a bleak future universe filled with dirty old buildings and industrial machines that seem to run all hours of the day. One day Henry's world is turned upside down when he learns that his girlfriend became pregnant and had his \\"baby.\\" The baby, it appears, is a mutant whose disfigurement was caused by the horribly polluted world in which they inhabit. The baby is sick, the wife leaves him, and Henry is forced to make a choice that could burden his conscience for the rest of his life.<br />Shot in beautiful black and white, Lynch creates a nightmare world in which machines are always heard rumbling away, characters are quirky, and the only escape Henry has is his own imagination. Lynch uses shocking and bizarre images to blend dreams with reality(which will become his trademark) It is the study of one lonely and depressed soul trapped in a nightmare universe where nobody cares. It is ERASERHEAD, if not David Lynch's best film, then it is certainly his most original. Watch it once, and it will haunt you for a long time to come. Watch it twice, and it will haunt you forever.<br />On the question of availibility, ERASERHEAD is not a film that you can find in your neighborhood Blockbuster. It's on moritorium and is very hard to find. But like Quentin Tarantino once said, the lack of availability often adds to a cult status. The best way to get your hands on a copy of ERASERHEAD, is to do it like I did, bid for it on EBAY. It might run for a little more than an average video. But I guarantee, you will not regret spending the extra money.
B00000099Y|1.0|This broke my CD player when I first tried to play it! And THEN I had to listen to the thing!
B000001FQI|5.0|Sure the excellent Songs From The Big Chair got better sales &amp; more commercial success but one will definately agree with me that 1989 epic masterpiece The Seeds Of Love is TFF most creative &amp; most consistant and is their masterpiece. To me there hasn't been a better period in music than mid to late 1989 with the Seeds Of Love &amp; Janet Jacksons Rhythm Nation 1814 being the best music the best year for music. Sadly this would be the album that would tear apart the dynamic Orzabal/Smith duo for the next ten years after this.<br />The edition I'm reviewing is the older version without the bonus tracks.<br />Woman In Chains begins this CD with a heartbreaking melody and a more soulful sound with the then unknown Oleta Adams singing on backup vocals and what a singing duo! This is a song I think that is about the abuse of womens rights judging from reading the lyrics. Badmans Song brings us into more upbeat terrority with a far more upbeat track with lots of jazzy blues-rock influences which also features Oleta Adams on guest vocals. This track is 8 and a half minutes long. fans who are The Big Chair  might find it difficult to enjoy this song but those who are open minded or more adventurous will definately love this song. The title track we've already heard before. It's a very beatle-esque song and is the most radio-friendly song on this CD and probably the only one that is. This is the only song that features Curt Smith on vocals. Advice For The Young At Heart is the winner on The Seeds Of Love. It's a very soulful song with deep lyrics and lots of organs and wash of guitar sways. The bridge in the middle of the song from 2:49 to 3:30 is my favorite part of the song with a much jazzier feel. Why this song failed to reach the top 40 is beyond me. Standing On The Corner Of The Third World starts off with Arab sounding flutes and strange sounding chimes and then becomes a mellow soul-oriented track. The song then blasts into a Gospel influenced track at the 2:48. The song mellows down but then speeds up again and kind of melts into a chaos of harmonicas and rock guitars before fading out. Swords &amp; Knife starts off with wobbly keyboards and then becomes an upbeat track and finally morphs into an ambient rock track with awesome beats. The song ends with the wobbly keyboards and then ties us into the next track Year Of The Knife. Year Of The Knife is probably the closest the Seeds Of Love comes to sounding like The Big Chair but even then this is a far cry from that album. Year Of The Knife is similar to Sponges 1994 hit Plowed with an identical drum loop bur less grunge-influenced and has awesome chorus and incredible singing once again by Oleta Adams. After that we head into more melancholy territory with the eerie Famous Last Words. Famous Last Words starts off with a siren like intro and piano and then becomes a sort of classical oriented song. At the 2:24 mark the song blasts into a power ballad with incredible atmosphere. What awesome lyrics. Incredible emotions. Incredibly powerful song. The song calms down and with the siren like ambience returning and then the song ends with the air raid siren sounds fading out bringing this CD to a close.<br />This CD is absolutely stunning on all fronts.<br />Seeds Of Love is recommended but I say get the remastered edition with the four bonus tracks. The bonus tracks flow quite well with the original eight tracks.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!2:48.

B000002N3J|5.0|\\"Something To Remember\\" is full of ballads from Madonna's career up to that point (1984-1995), plus a few new recordings (including a personal favorite \\"You'll See\\").<br />Naturally, if you are a big fan of Madonna, you want this CD! But also, if you enjoy things like ballads & love songs, you won't be disappointed either! However, there are a few songs that are just, in my opinion, stupid--for example, \\"Oh Father\\" and \\"Forbidden Love.\\" But I think the other tracks make up for those in full.<br />Give \\"Something To Remember\\" a try--it's worth the money.
0316666343|5.0|I could not put this book down. Sebold's got a fresh writing style, an innovative plot, great characters, and a penchant for the wonderfully small details of life. You'll laugh and cry on the same page. I also recommend Sebold's memoir/biography-\\"Lucky\\". It's another great book from an amazing writer.
1559277254|3.0|Stephanie Plum everyone's  favorite semi-heroine, does it again, a great story. Just do your self a favor and save your money and buy the paperback book, not the audio tape. It never fails, they get a good reader, get you hooked on the stories, and for some reason they throw the baby out with the bathwater, they change the narrators. This one is the pits. I enjoy the audio books as I travel. The reader makes an enormous impact on the feel of the story. This lady ruins the story. I had to force myself to listen to the whole thing, in spite of her terrible narration. Please save your money. \\"Listener Beware\\"
B0000542DH|5.0|I have to say that I love most of Oliver Stone's work. I think he's really exceptional. He's defintely one of my favorite directors. I loved JFK (*****), Wallstreet (*****), Nixon (****), U-Turn (*****) and of course Born on the Fourth of July (*****). But as far as vision, I think that NBK is the best. Not because of the violence, but the storyline. The media does influence people. (Look at the last case against NBK's director Oliver Stone. Two young kids killed a bunch of people at a convient mart, all because they seen NBK). I mean, is the media responsible? Some would say yes, I defintely say yes. But should the media be charged with the crime when someone commits a crime?<BR>Of course not. People have free will and make the decisions they want to make. The media is part responsible for making it, but people know what their doing. Anyways, this movie is more that violence. Its the camera work. They used handheld cameras, psychadelic special effects, and gritty quality. (Even on the DVD, which I purchased today). I loved this film, I mostly bought it for the movie, but a lot of the persuasion was the fact of all the special features. Some are really good, others are not. The deleted scenes are really a joke. (With the exception of the Ashley Judd courtroom scene). The alternate ending was pathedic. (However Oliver Stone said it could pave the way for a sequel, in which Micky (Harrelson) and Mallorey (Lewis) get the passion for killing again and embark on another \\"Death Fest\\". This story is about two young lovers, Micky (Woody Harrelson, White Men Can't Jump) and Mallorey (Juliette Lewis, Kalifornia), who go on a killing spree. Killing anyone, and almost everyone. (With exception of the one who will tell the tale of Micky and Mallorey). After they are finally apprehended, they must deal with a cop who wants them to fry, (Tom Sizemore; Saving Private Ryan), a Warden (Tommy Lee Jones; JFK), who is less than pleased that their in his prison and a T.V Journalist (Robert Downy Jr; Bram Stokers Dracula) who wants to find out more.
0316666343|2.0|I heard a lot about this book while reading USA Today and watching Good Morning America, who both said this book was uplifting and wonderful.  I disagree completely.  For one, the premise itself is awful (she is raped and killed in the first 2 chapters) and the reader is forced to watch her family fall apart  and her friends slowly forget.  The ending was very unsatisfying and the \\"miracle\\" described in the cover made me angry.  I don't recommend this book at all.
630469797X|5.0|And Dario Argento was involved, too!<br />MAN, I just LOVE this movie!  There's supposed to be a 3 disc set out soon, so hold that cash.  I mean, 200 bucks is alot for any movie.<br />I know some will say no, but Dawn of the Dead is better than Night of the Living Dead.  it's got more horror and more humor.  You can't go wrong.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I only just saw the movie in a theater, and most Danish reviewers rambled on about how Lynch had gotten weird again. Well, I saw it with a friend, and after the movie we just looked at eachother and agreed that 1) it was great, and 2) not weird. We felt we understood it, what with timeshifts, alternative and parallel universes and somesuch. I'm not saying that this is what it's really about, but who cares? That's what we came up with, and that's enough. The movie's flawless, the acting great, the score fantastic (especially the scene in Club Silencio). Well, maybe my friend and I are just insane, or we have a different chain of thoughts that most other people. Afterwards we went out on town, and all the time I felt like being in a Lynch-movie, that's the impact the film had on me. Watch it. You'll not be disappointed.
B00003CXN4|5.0|I had went to theaters to see this movie. (Mainly because the previews said it was a knockout, brilliant, and in every critics top 10 list). I was a little skeptical at first, but once it starts it pulls you in. From begining to end, this film lacks nothing. Whether you like it for the acting, (Don Cheadle, Benicio Del Torro, or Michael Douglas all do superb, along with most others), whether you like it for the cinematography, (I'm not sure who did it, but watch for the color difference between Washington, DC (Michael Douglas' scenes), Mexico (Benicio Del Torro's scenes), or San Diego (where a bunch of rich kids live), you will be amazed. Another thing is the rock solid story line with snappy dialouge. And not to mention the allstar cast of Benicio Del Torro, (The &quot;Good&quot; Cop), Michael Douglas (Head of the DEA), Catherine Zeta-Jones (A Rich, Pampered, Housewife), Dennis Quaid (The Crooked Lawyer), Don Cheadle (Undercover Cop), along with numerous cameos from Selma Hayek, ect. This film can not be beat. With A+ acting, story, and without a doubt the BEST cinematography ever! You cant afford to miss TRAFFIC. This film is a 2 1/2 hr long drama, which needs to be viewed in FULL. I know of quite a few people who quit watching it half-way through. You will ruin one of the greatest movie experiences ever if you do this. Winner of 5 Academy Awards including: Best Supporting Actor (Del Torro), Best Director (Steven Soderbergh), Best Film Editing, Best Sound Editing, Best Cinematography!
0316666343|5.0|As a 14 year old girl living in suburbia, I could relate to the main character very closely, right down to the fact that we share a passion for photography and have a somewhat estranged family. Alice Sebold is such an amazing author and tells this story from such an interesting viewpoint, up above in heaven.Filled with love & hope, and yet despair & sympathy this book will blow you off your feet. I COULD NOT put it donw until it was finished, and then I wanted more.
B00000G3AZ|2.0|Perhaps I would have liked this adaptation if I hadn't seen the BBC's version first. Or if I hadn't read the book. However I regret to report that Miramax's &quot;Emma&quot; was painful to watch. I felt like they were trying too hard. Perhaps the screenwriters were desperatley hoping to rake in the &quot;Clueless&quot; audience. As an avid admirer of all things Austen I was throughly disappointed. The story was so chopped up, not simply abridged, but chopped, that I didn't feel the closeness of the relationships that I got from the other version and the book. It was sadly 2 dimensional and forced. But, any movie with Ewan MacGragor singing can't be all bad.
B000002MZ9|4.0|As a long-time admirer of Neil Young and a casual fan of Pearl Jam, I always fancied this album would be a worthwhile and memorable project. I was not disappointed. Mirror Ball is similar to some of Neil Young's other &quot;jam&quot; albums - Ragged Glory, Broken Arrow - in essence, but is quite a bit wider in scope. While the &quot;incompetent yet brilliant&quot; musicians of Crazy Horse have always personified the Garage Band That Made It Really Big and are the adequate and ideal band for backing Neil Young's rawer, less lyrically ambitious, more jam-heavy songs, you usually know just what to expect from the Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse albums - and that's just what you get. Rarely do they challenge their bandleader. Pearl Jam, while not featuring Yes-level musicianship, are nonetheless a tighter and more focused (not to mention more famous - hence, the automatic higher expectations) band - and they do push Young at points on this recording. Here he has written far more ambitious songs than he usually does in the context of this type of album: his lyrics here are some of his best ever - vivid, imagistic, startling, and captivating. The album also pushes the envelope musically. In addition to Neil, one of rock music's best and most distinctive guitar players, we have Pearl Jam's two fine players - Mike McCready and Stone Gossard - as well. They create, together, some truly great musical interplay on this record. Although still raw in essence, these songs move beyond the musical (and lyrical) level that you would expect from this type of Neil Young album: it's another level of sophistication. Neil has also written some truly great songs for this record - Song X, Peace and Love, Downtown, Scenery, and, especially, I'm The Ocean. An essential record for Young fans; Pearl Jam fans should take the dive as well.
B00006CXSS|5.0|They were ordinary men, swept up in the most extraordinary conflict in history. But with the eyes of the world upon them, they found their greatest source of strength in each other. Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg and HBO present the story of Easy Company, an elite team of U.S. paratroopers whose World War II exploits are as incredible as they are true. This landmark ten-part miniseries based on Stephen E. Ambrose's non-fiction best-seller recounts the remarkable achievements of a volunteer rifle company that parachuted into France on D-Day, spearheaded the Market-Garden and Rhine offensives, fought the Nazis in Bastogne and the Bulge and captured Hitler's \\"impenetrable\\" Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden in 1945. The ensemble cast includes Kirk Acevedo (HBO's Oz), David Schwimmer (TV's Friends), Jimmy Fallon (TV's Saturday Night Live), Colin Hanks (TV's Roswell), Damian Lewis (Hearts and Bones), Neal McDonough (Star Trek: First Contact), Donnie Wahlberg (The Sixth Sense) and Ron Livingston (Swingers). The series captures what it was like for these brave young men to be in WWII, in some of the most important battles in history. The men of Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st \\"Screaming Eagles\\" Airborne Division, U.S. Army had no easy tasks, but when asked, they came running. These men werent your average men in the military, they were put through the worst possible training, took the worst missions, including taking \\"The Battle of the Buldge\\", which was a horrifying battle, to say the least. These men when asked why they went to war, they simply replied \\"Its just what had to be done\\". Finally the Mini-Series event makes its way to DVD in a great little package. The 6-Disc DVD Box Set has all 10 Episodes of the series in anamorphic widescreen, Documentary We Stand Alone Together that lasts 1 hour and 20 minutes, The Making of Band of Brothers which lasts another 30 minutes and Video Diaries (Ron Livingston) The Making of the Film Through the Eyes of anActor which lasts 1 hour. I will own this set the day it comes out, and for ninty bucks I think anyone who has seen the series will. This set will not be for rent, so I suggest you buy it the day it comes out, or the price will be jacked up and probably be right at one hundred and fifty bucks. For everyone who has seen the series its needless to say that if you miss this deal, you might miss Band of Brothers. Because you never know when the Box Set might go out of print.
B000002U82|5.0|This definetly is one of the most timeless cd's of all time.  A big mistake a lot of people make is assuming that the tracks should be cut up individually and listen to them that way.  DSOTM is a masterpiece because it is a continuous work that flows perfectly from track to track.  While some tracks may not stand by themselves so well, the album overall is magnificent.  All the tracks mesh perfectly when listened to as a whole piece of art.
0800141660|4.0|Okay, so ELinor was supposed to be 19 and Brandon only 35. Emma Thompson fudged with the ages a little. So what? If I was Emma Thompson and over 19 and writing this screenplay I would do so myself. There were a couple of times, I grant you, that I did wish that Elinor was being played by a younger actress. But only a couple of times and I have watched this movie more times than I care to report. And Alan Rickman was over 35 but he's ALAN RICKMAN and he provided a beautiful portrayl of Colonel Brandon. As for Ms. Thompson's alterations and additions they were for the most part not only neccessary for a screen adaptation but delightful and on reading the book I missed the scene about the atlas. Ms. Thompson's writing is quite charming and a delightful companion to the book.
0783240503|5.0|As a person who will probablly never see a real stage show, I love this movie.  Donny Osmond is perfect for this roll.  &quot;Close every door&quot; is my favorite song.  I have the movie and the cd.  I believe it is a wonderful movie for children.  An introduction to a bible story that makes it fun to learn.  Alot of the reviews are being based on the real stage play, but if you've never seen the real play..... It's like reading the book and then seeing the movie.  For us who have never seen the play on Broadway, it is a real treat and I'm glad to of had the opportunity to see it on video.

Bad Enya, you could do SO much better than this, and until you do, McKennitt is the answer :)
0312265859|1.0|Because that's what the narrator sounds like, I can imagine a champagne glass, designer dress and pearls on Loreli King, but not on Stephanie Plum.  of course, I'm talking about the audio book.  I was lucky enough to discover the Stephanie Plum series on audio book #4, followed by 5 and 6, all narrated by Debbie Mazar. I remembered her immediately from some lawyer TV series a while back so even the picture fit. I enjoyed them immensely on long drives where the laughing kept me awake.  They were those rare books where the voice matched the character. Debbie Mazar is ultimate Stephanie Plum, carrying it off with gum chewing, wise-cracking perfect Jersey style.   The story itself is still good as the previous one, but do yourself a favor, buy the book, not the audio tape!  Janet, get Debbie back, no matter what you have to offer!!!
0440214041|4.0|The Pelican Brief could have been better, but nonetheless was another example of author John Grisham's ability to write suspenseful, gripping novels about lawyers and other law-involved figures.  I am a Republican and conservative, and contrary to another opinion I read I enjoyed it immensly.  However, if you have yet to read his book such as The Runaway Jury, The Firm, or The Partner, then you may wish to read these first.  Grisham is undoubtedly one of the best authors of today, and this book is another example of his fine work.

Let them experience the crunchy guitars crashing over the drowning piano in the title track, take them to the apartment where Waldo Jeffers meets his untimely demise inside a shipping container, and let them experience the nightmare of Lady Godiva and her operation. Tempt them with the haunting beauty of Here She Comes Now just to set them up for the frantic I Heard Her Call My Name. And just when they think that their neighbor has completely flipped and that it can't possibly get any crazier, finish them with the incindiary Sister Ray. When it's finished, you're sure to be tops on everyone's Christmas card list come December. <br />This album is not background music. This isn't cuddle with your girlfriend music, or sing your toddler to sleep music. If you're looking for mellow, skip this album and buy something safe. This album is like an armed robbery. Give it all your attention and hopefully no one will get hurt. If youre looking for an album so obnoxiously loud and demanding that you're scared to give it anything less than what it wants, buy it. If you're not afraid of music that challenges you on all possible fronts, you have found an album that will keep you coming back for years. It will also clear your house of any lingering guests after Thanksgiving dinner to boot.
0440224764|5.0|The Partner is perhaps the best book I have read in Grisham's amazing collection of books.  The Partner is the most cleverly plotted, fast paced, surprising book that I have probably ever read.  If you are thinking of not purchasing it because Grisham writes about law and lawyers, this book will undoubtedly surprise you.  Buy it today, and I assure you that you'll not only like it, but you will LOVE it.
B000002MIF|5.0|Like the Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" every track is a hit on this musical masterpiece.  Sure, many of the songs are in collection CDs, but this original release is the 90s equivalent of \\"Disraeli Gears\\" by Cream --- these songs should be enjoyed in the sequence laid out in HATFUL OF HOLLOW.  My personal favorite is \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now,\\" with unforgettable lyrics like \\"I was looking for a job, and then I found a job, and heaven knows I'm miserable now.\\"  Morrissey discloses in these songs the secrets we wish we could blurt out, but bury.  He dares to admit to confusion and indecision, and the result is an uncanny intimacy with his audience.  Enjoy it!
0440211727|5.0|Grisham's novel A Time To Kill is another example of his writing ability.  It is a great story, but differs slightly from his other novels due to the lack of the twists in the plot.  This book is still a great one, but I beg to differ with another reviewer who claims that this book tops The Firm.  The Firm and The Partner both beat this book out, even if ever-so-slightly.  For a first time reader, I suggest The Firm or The Partner, but otherwise this is a fine book and worth the money (as are all of Grisham's novels).
0060196122|4.0|I read this book about 2 years ago,and all the scenarios are still in my head.I don't call it a fiction,it's far more than a fiction.We are all somehow stuck in the world we live in,and suffocated by the so-called reality that we created,but we seem to forget that life is still beautiful and short!what's really important now is to make our existence worthy,and go for our dreams.Ideas may differ,but what are we doing here for these years if we don't know what we are here for?read this book.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Every time i looked at something here on amazon.com, i was recomended this alum.  The review also mentioned neil young and bob dylan, so, i got to wonderin if it was my kind of record.  I'd never heard anything by wilco so I ws going out on a tightly budgeted limb when I saw YHF in my local (useless) cd store and ecided to give it a try.<br />There are a couple of songs on the album that I haven't yet warmed to (one being radio cure), but I'm sure its just because I haven't listened to it enough.<br />As a rule, i don't like repetition of lines in songs, but the tendency in some of the songs to repeat is more than compensated for by the cool diversity of sounds on this album.<br />I don' know anything about wilco and so I had no expectations coming to this cd, and i've come away from it with a few favourites.  <br />i'm the man who loves you is a really cool song, as is heavy metal drummer and i am trying to break your hear and...<br />Its just a good album.  you should try it
B000002UWF|5.0|I have brought this CD to many parties, etc. and everyone just loves it.  Whether you are a Louis Prima fan or not, you just can't sit still when Louie blasts out the greats.<BR>I recently brought it to our large extended Italian family's reunion and they danced until the wee hours, never wanting another CD played except this one.  <BR>Although Louis is gone, he's not forgotten.  Even my young adult children love this one.
B000067CPX|4.0|I bought this album after listening to it at a Virgin Megastore. Aside from the fact that it's the Chili Peppers, the single selling point of the album for me was \\"Don't Forget Me.\\" It's slow build-up and sheer emotion reminded me of the classic \\"Under the Bridge.\\" Unfortunately, the cd really wouldn't get any better for me after that--partially because \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is such a great song, but also because a lot of it is simply so-so.<br />Don't get me wrong. The songs all fit together pretty well, and the quality of the music is decent if not the Chili Peppers' best. However, it feels like it's missing something. The beats are there, but not quite as funky; Fruiscante's great riffs are there, but not as rocking; the drumming seems to lack feeling. There are none Flea's REALLY good bass solos. A couple songs, such as \\"By the Way\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" almost capture the feeling of their older music, but even they're kind of weak.<br />It's not that I expect the Red Hot Chili Peppers to be still jumping around white-boy funk rapping with socks hanging off their persons. I think it's cool that in this time of cheap numetal rock-rappers that all sound the same, the Chili Peppers have decided to expand their horizons. However, I miss the funk and the feeling of their older stuff, particularly Blood Sugar Sex Magik (definitely one of the best albums of the 90s) among others. I wouldn't say they've sold out, they're just not quite at their best here.<br />Despite my complaints, this is still comparatively good music. \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is excellent, if I haven't mentioned that before. \\"Cabron\\" and \\"On Mercury\\" are catchy and original. \\"Can't Stop,\\" \\"By the Way,\\" \\"This is the Place,\\" and \\"Venice Queen\\" are all good too. I'd definitely recommend this album to any open-minded RHCP fan or anyone who wants to hear something unique, because the Chili Peppers at their weakest are still a lot better than most other bands at their best.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This 2001 award-winning film takes place in 1932 in a country house in England.  Guests have assembled for a shooting party and the servants are busy.  It's a perfect setting for a classic murder mystery.  But Robert Altman is the director, and so the limitations of the genre disappear in a multi-layered story with a cast of no less than 35 characters. Each character shines for a brief moment as this very interesting tale moves back and forth between the guests and the servants, making a joke out of upper class snobbery while, at the same time showing how dependent they are on the servant class.<br />Julian Fellowes received an Academy Award for the screenplay, which was based on an idea by Robert Altman and Bob Balaban, who also appears in the film in a comedic role of a Hollywood producer.  It's fun to watch all the characters interact as little by little we learn how they are all connected.  Each one is in a life and death struggle for something.  And each one has some sort of secret.  As the film progresses, I found myself saying \\"ah ha\\" a lot at each sign of recognition.<br />The cast is terrific:  Maggie Smith as a countess who is dependent on her brother, the lord of the estate, for her income; Kristin Scott Thomas as the wife of the rich man; Helen Mirren as the housekeeper with a deep secret; Emily Watson as a maid; Alan Bates as the head butler.  Accolades could just go on and on.  There's masterful acting here.<br />The DVD is full of interesting behind-the-scenes tidbits as Robert Altman describes the process for getting the best performances from the actors.  There's even a whole section devoted to the film's authenticity as some real-life servants who worked in an English country house in the 1930s were hired to advise the producers on every detail of service at that time, down to the color of the bow tie that the footman wore.<br />This film is destined to be a classic in its own right. I give it one of my highest recommendations.  Don't miss it!
B00006F2TV|5.0|After seeing this movie on the first day at the first showing in my town, I was then turned into a huge Spider-Man [fan]!  The movie was excellent!!  It was better than I thought it would be. The acting was great, especially Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. They brought the roles to life with their great knowledge of the Spider-Man past.  The special effects will keep you on the edge of your seat, and keep you waiting for the next installment.  Which is set to hit theaters on May 7th, 2004.  Until then True Believers!
B00003CXTF|2.0|It's sad, with the amount of money spent and the historical interest in WWII this could have been a really good film.  It just needs a screenplay, a director who can direct, actors who can act, and a plot that's not quite so contrived.  Instead, the filmmakers took the low road of trying to make a buck my integrating (should I say stealing) as many film cliché's as possible.  A woman looses the love of her life due to the war, finds her new love, only to have her first lover reappear creating a hopeless love triangle (anyone see Casablanca?).  War as hell is captured on film by showing bombs and bullets killing massive numbers of people (anyone see Saving Private Ryan?).  People struggle and drown as the ship sinks (anyone see Titanic?).  The nurse ventures into the throng of wounded, dead and dying and is overwhelmed with the magnitude of the carnage (anyone see Gone with the Wind?).<br />I could put up with the cinematic cliché's if only the acting, screenplay, and direction weren't so lame.  It's obvious the actors are, well, acting.  Little genuine emotion reaches the viewer, and the dialogue is unbelievably contrived.  There is no gratuitous nudity or sex, but in this film their inclusion would have been a welcome diversion. <br />Having said all that, I'll give the film 2 stars, if only for the action, costumes, some pretty good aerial dog fighting footage, and the pure spectacle of it all.
6303589170|5.0|Buy it. Rent it. Call a friend who owns it, but you must see this movie. It's too good to miss. I don't know why a sequel hasn't been made or at the very least, a TV series. Hollywood, give us a break and make another one. PLEASE!
0316666343|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews on this site, I began The Lovely Bones tentatively, not knowing whether or not it would equal its critical hype. I needn't have worried. This is a luminous read -- at once a coming-of-age saga and a story about the wrenching consequences of tragic death and the healing power of time and change. <BR>This is a novel that kept me reading and has stayed with me ever since I read the last pages.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I am a huge fan of free jazz.  Like Radiohead's music, free jazz is a form that needs patience.  LISTENING is the key to both.

It was even better than I remembered it as a child.<br />This creative work is an alegory of the gospel in the form of a modern children's fairy tale.  The story itself is very entertaining.  <br />The allegory simply adds to the value of the book.  Aspects of this story pronounce parts of the gospel people overlook or grow numb to.  It serves as an excellent introduction or supplement to the gospel for adults and children alike.<br />This is clearly the best of the Narnia series and an excellent place to begin.  The publishers have numbered the books according to thier setting in Narnian time, but this book was published first.

B00005JKTF|3.0|I love Cate Blanchett - and the movie gets an extra star because, well...it has Cate Blanchett in it. She is mesmerizing in any role that she is in and she is always well placed in a period piece like this. That being said - the story is quite a let down, many of the situations are contrived and there are plot holes you could drive a Panzer Tank through. Combine this with the lack of any really new ideas from other (better) done WWII spy movies and the result is a flat movie whose female Director emphasizes the romantic elements of the characters rather than deliver on a taught, suspenseful thriller one would expect.
B00004Y7GI|5.0|The first time I saw it, I loved it very much. I'm a Chinese girl, maybe my English is poor, but I still want to say that I like foreign literature very much.

B00005KAQP|5.0|\\"Sister Act\\" is one of the funniest and best made films of the early 1990's.  Starring Whoopi Goldberg as Delores Van Cartier, (a lounge singer working in a Reno, Nevada casino) the film begins with a flashback showing a young and irreverent Delores in a Catholic parochial school being reprimanded by a nun after giving the names of the Beatles for the names of the apostles.  The nun warns Delores that she won't amount to much if she maintains her poor attitude.<br />Returning to the present, we see the hapless Delores and her two back-up singers performing before a mostly empty audience in a Reno casino.  Unhappy with her career and her married boyfriend, Vince LaRocca (played by Harvey Keitel), Delores decides to leave, but Vince appeases her by giving her a mink coat.  When Delores discovers that the coat actually belongs to his wife, she tromps over to Vince's office, where she unwittingly sees Vince shoot one of his employees.  Sadly, Delores' unfortunate appearance did not go unnoticed as Vince orders his henchmen to get Delores.  She bolts out of Vince's office and into the casino where she manages to escape and flees to the police.<br />Now knowing that her exboyfriend Vince is a gangster, police lieutenant Eddie Souther (played by Bill Nunn), tells Delores that she must enter the witness protection program to be safe until she can testify against Vince.  Eddie takes Delores to San Francisco so that she can assume her new identity as a nun in a convent.<br />After Eddie leaves, the very unhappy Delores cannot hide her horror of being a nun and Mother Superior (played by Maggie Smith) is not thrilled with the situation either.  You can't help but laugh while watching Mother Superior's attempts to find a suitable place for Delores (now known as Sister Mary Clarence) within the convent or Delores' disgust with \\"looking like a penguin,\\" as she puts it.  Meanwhile, two of the convent's nuns, Sister Mary Patrick (played by Kathy Najimy) and Sister Mary Robert (played by Wendy Makkena) become endeared with Sister Mary Clarence.<br />Mother Superior finally decides to have Sister Mary Clarence join the convent's inharmonic choir, which has been under the tutelage of Sister Mary Lazurus, who was played by Mary Wickes.  This wasn't the first time that Mary Wickes portrayed a nun: she also portrayed Sister Clarissa in the films \\"The Trouble with Angels\\" in 1966 and its sequel \\"Where Angels Go Trouble Follows\\" in 1968.<br />Will Delores find a way to survive life in the convent and bring harmony to the choir? Will Mother Superior be able to keep her sanity in tact?  Will Vince find where Delores is hiding?  To answer these questions, sit back, watch this film and be prepared to laugh!<br />The film's rendering on DVD and sound quality are both very good.

0064431789|5.0|I remember this from childhood.  I went through hundreds, I just always loved books.  Time passes quickly and suddenly you are a parent. You naturally want to share your favorite childhood books with your child, only to realize you don't remember them! Well, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE isn't one of those forgotten books.<br />It is a story of Max who was a bit too \\"wild\\" for his mom to handle one night. She called him, \\"WILD THING!\\" and Max said, \\"I'LL EAT YOU UP!\\" He shouldn't have said that because his mother promptly sent him to bed without supper.  But Max's room transformed into a magical place. With trees and vines that \\"grew and grew,\\" it became \\"the world all around.\\" His very own private boat sailed him off \\"to where the WILD THINGS are.<br />The reader is pulled into the story with the amazing illustrations, (chiaroscuro in top form) and the interesting, succinct story. The child BECOMES Max and enjoys ruling over the wild things and doing wild things like dancing and howling under the moon. Each wild thing is very expressive and interesting to look at--so much so, that now there are collectibles of each one in toy stores! I think that the way they are rendered--not scary, not cute, but so wonderfully ambiguous, is what brings the reader back again and again. Bravo, Mr. Sendak!<br />WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE is, in my opinion, a must-own book for children of all ages. It earns the highest recommendation for a children's book. No wonder everyone gives it 5 stars; it's a true classic and winner of the Caldecott Medal for the \\"Most Distinguished Picture Book of the Year.\\" Get a copy today to share with your \\"wild things.\\"
B00005ATQH|2.0|I haven't read the book, yet, but I always thought Lolita was the manipulative one.  Her stepfather seems the be one forcing the issue -- manipulative, creepy, obsessive.  He is the one driving all the action, &amp; she rides along semi-passively for most part.  I imagined her the experienced seductress.  She's more of a teenybopper half-heartedly playing mind games because she can.

B000009O8A|3.0|Well, its been a long time coming for those of us in the UK who were too young to see this first time round. The film is still banned here in its UNCUT version.<br />I was surprised to see that the film is NOT AS BAD AS HAS BEEN REPORTED...but Zarchi clearly is treating the subject matter seriously. Sure, its part exploitation, but no one can be unsure about the film-makers desire to show us the damage caused by the crime and its devastating effect. I wasn't cheering at that end...its too sad for that. Worth a watch definitely.
B00005JSGK|5.0|I ran across this movie by accident on late nite TV -- and I loved it! Hatari is East Africa 40 years ago. There's no plot to speak of. John Wayne heads a team that chases down and catches animals to sell to zoos. They carry guns -- but they don't shoot anything; they smoke and drink to excess and eat lots of fatty foods (crab cakes fried in antelope fat!); they drive old beat-up jeeps and land rovers and they don't wear seatbelts -- and when they roll a jeep they pick everybody up and dust them off instead of calling a doctor (or a lawyer); the men are dumb and tough and lovable and honest and the women are smart and competent and sexy and honest -- and they don't have to prove anything to anybody. <br /> There's no way you could make this movie now. These guys lasso real animals -- giraffes and rhinos and zebras -- and wrestle them to the ground and put them in cages. The animals were probably not amused. But Hatari was politically correct in its day. Wayne's team includes a German, a Frenchman, an American Indian, a Spaniard, and an Italian femme fatale and they all get along pretty well. The Africans in the movie are called boys and there's not a hint that they might prefer to be called something else, like Mr. or Sir. <BR> <BR>The scenery is marvelous, the photography fabulous, the music cute, the comedy stupid, the love scenes corny, and the animal capture scenes are fascinating. So this is how zoos get their animals.... <br />Hatari is an idealized Africa of Bwanas and boys. Today, I suppose we're safer, happier, healthier, etc., but living in the shadow of Kilimanjaro and chasing animals around sure looks like a lot of fun.
B000069HKH|5.0|This album is nothing short of a masterwork which stands on it's own.  No, this is not Born to Run which belongs in it's own time and place, much like Carole King's Tapesty.  Yes, the sound is different and yet familiar managing to cover much of Mr. Springsteen's territory, but yet breaks new ground. I can recall the flack Joni Mitchell received for not doing another \\"Court and Spark\\" when she followed with \\"Hissing of Summer Lawns\\" or \\"Hejira\\", which now in retrospect are two of her strongest and deepest work.  Those of you who haven't connected, give it time.  This is something we rarely see, much like the aforementioned albums by King and Mitchell: A MASTERWORK. Perhaps we have grown too accustomed to the disposable music culture that pollutes our air and when something like this that comes along, with true vision, we cannot see it for what it is.  This album is very catholic in it's approach, universal in it's themes (isn't grief and loss, grief and loss whether it is 9/11, disolution of a relationship, or death?)  In the end, I feel this work owes much to Laura Nyro, particularly in the lyrics.  So much so, I would like to hear Bruce incorporate her \\"Save The Country\\" in his concerts.  \\"...common people, come on down to the glory river, gonna wash you up gonna wash you down...\\"<BR>Strong stuff.  Beautiful stuff.  Thanks Bruce.
0140186409|2.0|I find it highly irritating when others start acting condescending towards people just for not liking their choice in books. I am eighteen years old, and I read THE GRAPES OF WRATH &quot;for fun&quot; (in other words, it was not a school assignment) in high school. I did not like it. Does that make me an &quot;immature&quot; reader? I don't think so! Contrary to what you seem to think about those who hate TGoW, I do enjoy &quot;serious&quot; books (The Good Earth; The Butcher Boy; Animal Farm; 1984; those not serious enough for you?) You would do better to stop making such outrageous presumptuous remarks based on a teenager's taste in books. Obviously, you cannot be much more mature than the readers you criticize, if you cannot handle a difference in taste. I personally love Lord of the Flies, for instance, but I understand that there are those who do not. Unlike you, I do not go around saying that those who do not like LotF are simply missing the bigger meaning behind the work.
B0000636UN|1.0|Ms.Crowe is nothing more than an imitator and opportunist.  She hitches a ride on any train that will offer her fame.  Never has this been more obvious than on this CD.  She stole the title from Mary Chapin Carpenter's far superior effort.  Even this CD's artwork is nearly identical to k.d.lang's Invincible Summer, another far superior effort. And I am not even addressing the recycled pop hooks littered throughout. People may be buying into this, but it is time they saw her and her music for what it is and is not.  Her own.
B000002KMY|5.0|&quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; was a great album but &quot;Mob Rules&quot; is the stronger of the first two Dio era Sabbath albums. One reason is Vinny Appice playing drums. His drumming is refreshing and powerful. Bill Ward had been sloppy since &quot;Sabotage&quot; in '75. Dio shows why his solo band would be so awesome. His singing and songwriting is way better then Ozzy. Sabbath sounded like they were going to be contenders for the heavy metal crown in the 80's. Dio gave his best performance since Rainbow's &quot;Rising&quot;. He wouldn't make his masterpiece until his own bands debut &quot;Holy Diver&quot;. This is a must for Black Sabbath fans, and all those interested in the Deep Purple/Sabbath/Dio family tree.
B000065V3H|4.0|One of the better non-John Hughes teen comedies of the 80s, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is not your typical boy meets girl flick. Ronny Miller (Patrick Dempsey) is a nerdish grass-cutter going into his senior year in high school. He has a yearning to join the 'popular clique,' and hook-up with its head beauty, Cindy Mancini (Amanda Peterson), a seemingly shallow cheerleader who lives next door to Ronny without hardly a glance in his direction. When Cindy ruins her mother's suede outfit at a party, she is desperate to replace the very expensive clothing. Enter Ronny, who offers to bail her out monetarily, on one condition - date him for a month at school. Ronny believes this will get him in with the popular crowd, and put him together with Cindy. She grudgingly agrees, and for a month, it seems to work. Ronny works his way up the social ladder, and Cindy opens up to him, revealing a not-so-shallow person underneath that beauty. She even starts to fall for our hero. Unfortunately, the quest for popularity has overshadowed his quest for the girl's heart, and he sacrifices her affections and his old 'nerd herd' friends for his new-found hipness. The picture proceeds to chronicle Ronny's rise (and fall) as the King of Hip, and Cindy's journey into maturity.<BR><BR>This is a fun film, though the message (Be yourself) does come off a bit heavy-handed. Most of the characters are one-noted. Dempsey puts in a great performance in one of his earlier roles as Ronny, who puts everything on the line for his shot at popularity. Peterson puts in a wonderful, natural turn as Cindy, who rises out of the shallow end of the popular pool to become a better person. A young Seth Green (Oz, 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer) turns in a spirited role as Ronny's brother Chuckie, and Courtney Gains is great as Ronny's put-upon and nearly-forgotten best friend Kenny. A highlight of the the film involves Ronny's dancing attempt at a high school mixer (He was watching National Geographic, not American Bandstand, while learning his moves). Paula Abdul choreographed the 'dance.'<BR><BR>All in all, a wonderful film about finding yourself, and not judging or being friends with people based on what 'clique' they belong to.<BR><BR>The DVD provides only Fullscreen, with Dolby Surround, but the film doesn't suffer from this form one bit. So Enjoy!
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever, despite the fact that Brad Pitt and his un-understandable accent was in it.  The dark humor throughout the entire film made me laugh so hard I had stomach cramps.  I msut say this movie isn't for all audiences, expecially children, and adults who can't find humor in  sarcastic/dark comedy.  However for those of us who enjoy a sarcastic look at the world laced with just the right amount of humor, and a plot to complicated to explain, this is the movie for you!!!
B000002HJA|4.0|I like this album. With that said, I am disappointed in the quality of the recording.  What happened to the vocal mix on the first few tracks?  It is as if they were embarrassed of the lyrical content and chose to just mumble along with the music.  The music is great but I have never been a big fan of the 10 minute silence breaks in the CD format.  I am a car music listener and if I wanted extended moments of silence I would turn off the stereo altogether, not put in a CD for it.  Almost all of the reviews I have read refer to Welcome to Sky Valley or this as the \\"Must Own\\" Kyuss albums, but for my 2 cents worth, Blues for the Red Sun is where you should start and my bet is that that is the album that will gravitate to your CD player more often than the other two mentioned.
B00005ASOC|5.0|I first saw Finding Forrester at an English presentation put on by a former Chemistry teacher of mine, who doubled as a writer.  I found myself completely engrossed in the film from the start, and it was all I could think about when it was stopped midway through at the end of the first part of the presentation.  After watching the rest, I remember thinking of Finding Forrester as one of those few movies done so well that it could have been a perfect rendition of a true story, even if it wasn't.  What it was was a touching and thoughtful film, one that didn't need special effects and such to bring about its success.  Sean Connery and Rob Brown complemented each other very well as the movie progressed, and I hope to see Brown step off from his first movie into a possible acting career.<br />I would also like to say this: If you are one of the people who feels the need to deride and downplay this film because of its similarity to Good Will Hunting and other films, you are ignorant and short-sighted (and there's plenty of you on this site).  Hey, I can only go where the evidence leads me.  Movies, in my opinion, are made to be enjoyed, not judged in relation to other films.  If you do that, you shouldn't be writing movie reviews, whether you are an individual who went to the theater or a professional movie reviewer (and sometimes, even in that case, the reviewer doesn't have a clue).<br />Finding Forrester is a statement about life, and that sometimes the way we see it isn't always right: the fact that an urban hoops-shooting black 16-year-old male could actually be something other than the common stereotype, a real writer with real talent.  Forrester helped him break free and show the world his gift.  It's a good story, not, like many of you believe, a stab at a \\"cheap Oscar.\\"  But it did deserve one.<br />-Nick Lauria
B000001A3H|5.0|I know this is probably blasphemy judging by the reviews of there three most popular albums but this is the one for me.  The sound quality is better than either Welcome or Circus and the songs seem more focused.  There are some more intense and crafty works on the other albums, but from beginning to end-this one is the best.
0064471837|5.0|I'm an extremely picky avid reader, and especially adore fantasy. Sabriel tell sof a girl, and a father who gets taken by a the Dead. She must becom ea necromancer, of sorts. While others use their powerful bells to bring the dead up, she must become the Abhorsen, and keep the dead down. She must venture off into the Old Kingdom to save her father, and the kingdom from Kerrigor. She meets a prince, frozen as a block of wood for two centuries.<br />This novel's plot winds like rope. It has a classic quest plot, but with countless twists. Nix's charecters seem so real! When a charecter falls, you can practically feel the pain. When a charecter cries, tears roll down your face. I especially love Mogget, a Free Magic being bound by a red collar in the shape of a cat. To find out more, READ IT!!<br />It's a must have book, filled with magic, dark deeds, dark charecters, and even a little bit of love mixed in. Lireal is the sequel, and Abhorsen is coming out in 2003, cannot wait!!!
B00003CX5P|3.0|The little boy who played the young Anikan Skywalker was wrong for the part.  It was as though he was to carry the film, but his character was too young.  Didn't care for Ewan Mcgregor's potrayal of Obi; it took a little getting used to.
0553260111|5.0|filled with action, leaves a mystery @ the end of every chapter. well written.
0783211856|5.0|One of the darkest, most lamentable eras in the long catalogue of inhuman crime has had the light of recognition thrust upon it in Steven Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST. The viciousness of genocide is so soul-destroying that each new generation needs to be reminded that the gap from internment camp to death camp is hardly a gap at all.  When Hitler's ovens first began their grisly business on a small scale in 1939, it was only a matter of a year before his death camps began to swallow their victims in the millions.  Oskar Schindler was very much like the 'ordinary' German who could see no evil, except for one thing. He began as an industrialist who saw in the Jew a means to an end of money.  He started to change when the distinction between the means and the end began to grow fuzzy.  He finished as a humanitarian who used the former end to safeguard the former means.  This change in his world view was a gradual one.  Liam Neeson, who plays Schindler, has difficulty in broaching this topic, even to himself, but when he does, he determines to be the proverbial one man who can make a difference.  He is not alone, of course.  Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) guides him more by example than exhortation.  But it is primarily these two who must work in solitude to make a dent in the daily killings.  The movie's many graphic scenes of death emphasize the often personal nature of the killing.  Amon Groeth (Ralph Fiennes) kills for joy, but in the end all that his superiors require of him is that he not stop doing so.  The mass killing is done on such a scale that not only the audience must wonder whether the decision to implement the Final Solution must have been happily shared by the entire spectrum of the German people.  The film's not so subtle suggestion is that Spielberg's film,like Goldhagen's book HITLER'S WILLING EXECUTIONERS, is a blanket condemnation of an entire people.  If only one man like Oskar Schindler could have made the impact that he did, then the viewer is forced to accept that had Germany had more Schindlers, then the List might have been immeasurably longer.  The concluding scene of the survivors meeting to place their little rocks of remembrances on the graves of those who did not survive is a stark reminder for this and all generations to come that the struggle to save human lives must always be a just one, even if faceless bureaucrats dictate otherwise.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of the Harry Potter book series.  I did sincerely hope that the movie would follow the book, because many big screen book adaptators take creative license to visualize their own interpretation.  In other words, they mess it up.  Overall, I was pleased with the first book's giant leap to the big screen, in spite of a few minor discrepancies.<BR>First of all, every actor hired to play a part in this movie was perfectly suited for his or her role.  Daniel Radcliffe IS Harry Potter!  If I ever see him on the street, where he will undoubtedly be mobbed by thirteen-year-old girls, I will probably slip up and call him Harry a few times!  I do hope that little guy becomes a big star and not just the next Macaulay Culkin.  He seems like a good kid. <BR>As I was saying, now when I read the other novels, I can picture these actors and actresses in my mind.  Bravo to the casting directors for giving accurate visual representations of the characters.  And another bravo to the actors themselves for doing an excellent job all around.  <BR>The special effects in this film were fantastic, especially in the Quidditch scene.  It is SO much better to see this game played out on the big screen than to read about it in the book.  You can never quite see the action in your head while reading, so this movie pieces that scene together for you.  That is why I call this movie \\"a great supplement to the book.\\"  It fills in gaps where your imagination may not have been so strong.<BR>This film is destined to be a kid-movie classic, right alongside films like \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\"  Not many kid-movies are for kids anymore ...but this one is relatively safe to show in schools on Movie Day Friday or during recess.   \\"Harry Potter\\" has brought a little respectability back to the children's films genre. <BR>The story is great and magical with some very true-to-life themes about uniqueness, bravery, and friendship.  Yes, there were a few moments that didn't stick to the book, namely Hermione's exclusion from the final challenge, but I couldn't help but feel like the movie at least did the book justice.  I understand that screenwriting is a difficult process that does not allow for everything in a book to be included in the film version.  That's the way it goes. <BR>As far as the DVD is concerned, the movie transfer and sound is very excellent, but the special features aren't so special.  I enjoyed the deleted scenes, but I did not enjoy the mess of a maze I had to endure to unlock them.  A word to the wise: find a website that specializes in DVD easter eggs.  Print out the directions to finding the deleted scenes and follow them to save time and frustration.  <BR>In the meantime, enjoy this first installment in what will prove to be a very profitable franchise.  I know lots of people, myself included, who are DYING to see \\"Chamber of Secrets.\\"  It's addictive!
B00005T33W|4.0|I loved this movie -- right up until the last two scenes.  Remember when the older man finally gets up and boards a bus and vanishes, and the look on Enid's face as the camera faded out?  That, I thought, was the perfect ambiguous ending.  But it didn't end there.  I would almost bet money that the studio said the audience needs a bit more resolution after that.  So we see Seymour in counseling(?) with his mother (whom we hadn't even met) outside the door, and then we see Enid at the same bus stom boarding a similar bus and riding off into the distance (a cliche unworthy of the rest of the movie, and anyway, where did she get the money to do this?).  Terrific movie, but I'm guessing studio interference kept it from ending on a perfect note.
B00005JCA9|5.0|Notting Hill - You either love it or you hate it, and since you don't spend this much money on a DVD without knowing whether or not you like the film this review is purely about the extras on the DVD, ultimate edition.  When I was trying to choose between the Collectors Edition and the Ultimate Edition I couldn't find any helpful reviews so here is the first Amazon review I have ever written.<br />Disc 1 -<br />Widescreen version of the film.  Choice of English or French language, English captions and Spanish subtitles.  Since I can't read Spanish I don't know what the difference between captions and subtitles is.<br />Feature commentary (subtitles available) - The Writer, Director and Producer talk over the whole film, providing a wonderful glimpse behind the scenes.  Non-stop anecdotes about filming, props, sets, stars and supporting cast.  The history of the blue door and the fate of garden benches.  Why the entire production crew had to dress up in jackets and ties. Which of those locations were in fact sets on a sound studio and loads of other stuff that makes you view the film with a fresh eye.  If you are still in love with Anna Scott and Wil Thacker, don't watch this as it does, to some extent, take away the magic of the story.<br />Spotlight on location (subtitles available) - 14:00 minutes - Scenes from the film with chat from the writer, director, producer, Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Emma Chambers and Hugh Bonneville.<br />Seasonal walk down Portobello Road - 3:30 minutes - Disappointingly short but very interesting.  The Special Effects Supervisor explains just how they filmed Hugh's one minute walk through six months of London's weather changes.<br />Deleted Scenes - 6 scenes cut from the finished film.  Many others are mentioned during the feature commentary but these are entertaining enough although personally I am glad they didn't make it to the final version.  William tries to tell his parents, another blind date at the dinner table, Spike serves Anna pepperoni pizza, Spike messing things up even more after Anna leaves, Spike giving wedding day interviews to the media and an alternative ending set in Tony's prospering restaurant.  <br />Music Highlights - Direct jumps to nine songs from the movie<br />Recommendations - Just a trailer for Erin Brockovich<br />Travel Book - About three pages of text from a (very poor) travel guide to Notting Hill with a map and list of restaurants.  I felt very cheated as I was expecting a live tour of the real Notting Hill; hoping for something like a thirty minute documentary you might see on the travel channel.<br />Production Notes - About a dozen pages of text, much of which is mentioned in the commentary.<br />Cast and Film Makers - Brief Bios of the main actors, the writer, producer and director.  <br />DVD Newsletter - Web address to register for on-line newsletter.  It didn't inspire me to register so I can't tell you anything about it.<br />DVD-ROM - If you have the hardware on your computer there 'might' be access to wallpapers, screen savers and internet sites.  It doesn't say exactly what and since I don't have a DVD-ROM I can't tell you anything else.<br />Disc 2<br />Full screen version of the film - Language and subtitles the same as disc 1<br />Feature Commentary - Same as disc 1<br />Music Highlights - Same as disc 1<br />Travel Book - Same as disc 1<br />Production Notes - Same as disc 1<br />Cast and Film Makers - Same as disc 1<br />DVD Newsletter - Same as disc 1<br />DVD-ROM - Same as disc 1<br />Hugh Grant's Movie Tips - 4:00 minutes - Disappointingly short.  Meet his parents and some of the crew.<br />Elvis Costello video - Elvis Costello singing his version of 'She'.  This video gave me a headache.  There are only four verses but I lost count at 50 camera jumps from Elvis in the theatre, Elvis sitting down and Elvis standing outside.  Some clips from the film included<br />Shania Twain video - Cute video of Shania singing 'You've got a way' with some clips from the film.  Nicely done.<br />Photograph Montage - 4:45 minutes - This I thought was going to be another space filler but I was very pleasantly surprised.  Stills from the film and a few behind the scenes shots set to the Anna and Wil music score by Trevor Jones.  I found it amazing how much more I saw in a still that I missed in the film.  Very well chosen pictures and beautiful music.<br />US Theatrical Trailer - 2:45 minutes - As seen in American Theatres<BR>International Theatrical Trailer - 2:10 minutes - As seen in English Theatres - These two trailers are totally different and really bring home the cultural differences between England and America.  I was surprised to see clips from a deleted scene here.<br />There it is.  If you got this far, thanks for reading.  By the way, I loved the film.  Like Four Weddings and a Funeral it is just so English.  Being English myself, from London, with a crush on Hugh Grant, I am of course extremely biased.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought this CD because the song that's been playing on the radio, Complicated, was on it, and I thought that song was great. But, unlike some CD's, the one radio song isn't the only good song on it. It remains a great CD throughout all the songs, especially Sk8ter Boi, and comes with lyrics, some scratched out and rewritten, as if they're the lyrics as she actually wrote them. If you like pop rock, especially if you liked Pink, you'll like her, but shes not just a Pink spinoff, she has her own style to her music, and you'll enjoy singing along/dancing/listening to her music.
B000002UDB|4.0|People,we agree that the Beatles put out a bunch of good if not great albums.Even though the second side is a 1967 singles compilation,this album should be no exception.\\"I Am The Walrus\\",\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" are classic John Lennon.\\"Hello Goodbye\\",\\"The Fool On The Hill\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" are classic Paul McCartney.You add \\"Flying\\" and the title track and you have 37 minutes of great Beatles music.Almost every album that I've encountered had some amount of filler and MMT is no exception.This album's filler track:\\"Blue Jay Way\\"...yuck!
B00000K3CR|5.0|Big is a great comic fantasy starring one of today's biggest stars Tom Hanks.  BIg is a supurb film that should be treasured for a long time.  Hanks is fantasic as Josh Baskin.  Big is about a 13 year old boy that wishes he was big, this all happened at a carnival one night where he couldn't get on a ride that requred a height limit.  So he goes to a machine that has a look of a devil named Zoltar and he wishes his wish and the dream came true the next morning. The movie has its moments were he's trying to get a job and doesn't know his social scurity number and uses his friend's locker combo as the number. Also the famous scene were he's playing chopsticks with his manager{Robert Loggia} on a Saturaday morning at FAO Schartz.  There's also some touching moments in this movie were he's walking  and he sees his girlfriend in school and a class photo  being taken, that was a bit touching.  Also when he's trying to say goodbye to his girlfriend {Elizabeth Perkins} that he works with.  If you like comedy, fantasy and romance this is the movie for you. THe DVD is not that bad it has a few production notes and a theatrical trailer.
B000002UZ1|5.0|With \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" being the only no-no on this collection (to the people that like that song I'm sorry...not!)this is a must for any Beatlefan's record/CD collection.Though I like the original \\"Across The Universe\\" from Anthology 2 ,the Spectorized version will do.Alot of reviewers have said where's this song and where's that song? Nothing can replace \\"Revolver\\",\\"The White Album\\",\\"Pepper\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\" and the list goes on.Just think,it took Capitol Records 4 vinyl albums or 4 (I still say it should have been 3) CD's to make a greatest hits collection of less than ten years of work,without ALOT of key album tracks.The single disc compilation that came out a couple of years ago is OK but it's just a sampler of greatness.I know they're costly ,but \\"Red\\" and \\"Blue\\" are worth it.
0380820846|5.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out and I was not disappointed. I don't know what the readers who gave less than 4 or 5 stars were thinking. I liked the fact that Colin was human. He had insecurities and jealousies just like the rest of us.I also liked that Lady Whistledown was unmasked and best of all I liked that Penelope finally got the love she deserved. The second best event was at the end when Cressida Twombly got what she deserved. I can't wait for Eloise's book, Julia. Hurry up!
B000005DSN|5.0|After I got the album &quot;Infinite&quot; by this band, I knew I had to get more. Sure enough I did. This album was the result. Anyone who likes good power metal bands should get this album. Even though I think Infinite was just a little tiny bit better, this album is still great. After reading that these people have been around since the early '80s, I knew right away that they would be good. Some bands tend to get bad after many years (can we say Metallica?) but not these guys. The guitar on this album is very good, and so is the vocals. If you like Iron Maiden, you would probably find it worthwile to get this as well.
6305807086|1.0|This movie was really messed up and hard to follow. Don't waste your time watching it.
B000051VWW|5.0|One might think this album would fizzle out after &quot;By Your Side&quot; so movingly opens this outstanding album.  However, this track just sets the stage for some of the best R &amp; B of recent years.  The acoustic guitar on &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Every Word&quot; is very effective in creating textures not often heard in today's drum machine dominated pop music.  Sade's vocals are achingly passionate on &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; (&quot;I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul&quot;--Wow!). &quot;Somebody Already Broke My Heart&quot; as well as &quot;It's Only Love That Gets You Through&quot; are tracks that prove the axiom that less is more.  They are subtle, yet powerful.  This album most deservingly won a Grammy Award.  Do not miss this gem.  Thank you Sade for releasing this beautiful and moving album!
0446608955|5.0|I just love reading old fashion love stories, such as A Walk to Remember. Landon falls for Jamie, the shy chrisitan girl in her class. Jamie's nice ways charmed Landon, who have never throught he could fall for a girl like Jamie, but he falls hard. Everyone who loves old fashion love stories with values, this is the one for you, but be prepared to cry.
B00005JKED|5.0|Talk about a kick in the pants!  Wow, Training Day is just that and more!  Denzel Washington turns in the performance of a lifetime, and Ethan Hawke proves he is up to the task in this gritty Urban drama set in the city of Angels.  <BR>The film details rookie detective Jake Hoyt's (Ethan Hawke)\\"training day\\", his day to prove to Alonzo Harris (the veteran narcotics agent portrayed by Washington) that he has what it takes to be on the team.  Hoyt watches with growing horror and dismay as Harris uses less than savory tactics to advance his own agenda using the same methods as those he is supposed to bring to justice.  <BR>The movie is peopled with actual gang members as extras and stars Dr.Dre, Snoop Dog and Macy Gray (who, in the words of the director was \\"ghetto fabulous!\\"), lending flavor and credence to this wonderful film. <BR>This movie is a tour de force, containing the best performance of both Washington and Hawke's career.  Buy it today!

B00005ATQF|4.0|Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam war, is essentially two films packaged as one.  The first half is an amazing piece of cinematic work, while the second half is not quite up to snuff. This gives the film a disjointed feel and leaves one wondering what is the point of the second half.  Honestly I would have been happy had he ended with the graduation from Parris Island, even if it would have meant a 45 mintue film.<BR>The first half, as I said, is amazing.  R. Lee Ermey turns in an Oscar winning performance (too bad the liberal Hollywood elite failed to even nominate him for an award)as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, the drill instructor who has the task of turning the Marine Recruits into fighting men worthy of the name U.S. Marine.  There are so many memerable moments in Ermey's portrayal that I couldn't list them all here.  Suffice it to say you will find yourself watching the boot camp sequences again and again.  <BR>The second half of the movie drags on, although we are following the main character, \\"Private Joker\\" through the rest of his time in the Marine's (or at least the most important part, his tour in 'Nam).  Not to take away from Matt Modine's performance, but I was unable to care about his character once he graduated from boot camp so I found myself drifting off during the second half of the movie.  <BR>Having said that, I still find myself being forced to rate the film at 4 stars, that's how great the first half of this film is.  If you've not seen it, then I suggest you rent it first.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Because this is one of the most beloved films of all time, it's gotten a real DVD treatment.  Ssome parts drag a bit, (the whole 40 minute featurette with Terry Jones and Michael Palin is quite boring and not up to the pace of typical Python humor.<br />But the highlight of this 2 disc DVD is not the Gilliam-drawn menus or mindless sing-alongs or even being told to insert the other DVD (no, I mean in your DVD player).  What really made me drop down and laugh hard was the lego animation.<br />That is awesome!
B0000069NM|5.0|This is the album Scofield did with the lineup of Medeski, Martin and Wood. The melodies are quite good, and the songs have the atmosphere of a smoky jazz bar. I like traditional jazz, but when I want something that is very easy on the ear, which has enough depth to be interesting, I pull this out. The first song is a fine moment. I saw this guy live on the 'Bump'tour and he is an incredible musician.
0553106635|5.0|George R.R. Martin has created a wonderful epic with his Song and Ice series. At first I was hesitant to read it becuase I thought it would go on endlessly like some of the other series, but it will not be. He already knows the ending (I think) and has already said that it would be finished in six books. I loved this third installment - even better than the second one. The great thing about these books is that you see the motivations for all the characters. Nothing is ever black and white. A villian in one book may turn out to be a hero in the next. Also, apparently, he does not hesitate to kill off characters as long as it serves the plot. This book was wonderfully done - a master weaver of tales.
B00000099Y|4.0|I really like this album and consider it an inspired piece of work. The songs are intense and dramatic, and the musicianship is incredible. The lyrics are good. However, (and I know some people like this about Tool) the lyrics are pretty twisted and hateful. Don't listen to hard to the lyrics of the first track unless you've got a strong stomach. Regardless of that I love this album, I just keep thinking 'love not hate' when I listen to it.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|I love watching american movies not because I like the US of A but because american film makers spent so much time, effort, money and dedication in bringing to audiences around the world great movies such as BLADE II...one of the great action movie I have seen so far!!!This film is superbly done!Great action choregraphy better than Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon!!!And this is the first really,of all the vampire films I've seen, that how a vampire should die its like being eaten by fire coming from the inside the CGI really compliments the action.The story is ok although it could have been done with the character of kris kristofferson (no bad personal intention) differently say becoming a truly bad vampire...anyhow just a suggestion...<BR>I could have given this 10 star but you can only give a max of 5 star!!!Last thing this review is based on the VCD format so I can't wait to order the DVD version just to fully experience the DD 5.1 and DTS sound format I'm sure this gonna blow me away!!!!
B00005QG9J|4.0|There are so many good lines on this CD. I love to listen to it for the lyrics alone. There is also a lot of good guitar and drums on this album, although it is definitely not as hard as their other stuff. I don't think there is a bad song on this record, although 'Further Down the River' seems a little cliche. Like 'Make Yourself' I have listened to this one over and over and have not gotten tired of it.
6304712499|2.0|Spawn is my favorite super hero of all time. This movie is not the comic book. All they did was take the title, the concept, the characters and made a super hero disaster. The comic book starts off him already established and trying to cope with his existence. This movie is nothing but plain, boring ... about this assassin coming back from the dead, already knowing his mission and planning to do it. In the comic book, Spawn had to find his way into discovering his past and discovering his mission on Earth. It would be great if they had that and they showed his journey into discovery and at the end, going after Jason Wynn. The Clown in the movie (took) the whole thing. He is the reason why I give this a *** stars. But still, it's a disappointed.<br />Besides the story and the adapting from the comic book that disappionted me was the cast. Who the hell is this Michael Jai White guy. No body knows who he is and he ... . He looks like a black pretty-boy. Spawn in the comic book was a rough and tough assassin. Michael \\"whatever\\" Jai White is not tough. Wesley Snipes would've been a great pick for the role of Al Simmons and he definately has the attitude and physique for the character. What also disappointed me was this Wanda girl. Whoever played Wanda, Al's former wife, is ugly, a terrible actress and is a terrible pick. Halle Berry would've been a great pick for Wanda or Vanessa Williams.<br />And what's up with this PG-13 ... . People, where's the R-rating!?! The cartoon is the best Spawn I've ever seen but this PG-13 is terrible. The movie should've followed the cartoon's footsteps: bad language (this is a guy from hell, I'd be cursing my way out of town if I just died and resurrected from hell), violence (they should've shown his anger against Wynn with violence against evil), and nudity (if this movie involves hell, we need rated R and since we got Wanda in the picture, we got to show something nice). <br />I just hope that in the near future, in a couple of years,Hollywood will decide to make another movie of \\"Spawn\\" and strip this piece of ... off the shelves of every video store. If you just want to see a movie with good special effects and funny jokes, go RENT this movie. But if you want to see a good super hero movie, go see Spider-Man or Blade (Blade 2 is better) or something because this is a disgrace to the comic book.<br />I feel so bad for Todd McFarlane.
B00005B36H|4.0|This album is very spiritual, with many lines which blew my mind the first time around. Unlike the other Tool CD's the hatred/perversion quota is kept down to a bare minimum (one song.) The music is so complex that I can't believe Tool is playing it. There are cross-rhythms all over the place. I really recommend this album to pagans and spiritualists, as well as to those who like good metal.
B00005JKCH|3.0|It's with a mixed feeling of different expectations I sit down in the cinema to watch SPIDER-MAN. I had a hope to see a Great Superheroflick, in the same class as Tim Burton's masterpiece BATMAN (1989). Then I had this more realistic spidersense telling me that \\"you know, this'll probably be a lot of fun, but really nothing else\\". Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but \\"a lot of fun\\" is kind of an understatement; It's REALLY a lot of fun watching SPIDER-MAN.<br />First off, there is two things that made me want to see this film;<br />1. As a kid Spidey was my idol, and Marvel my heaven. This resulted in me knowing state-of-the-art-geek-stuff for the rest of my life. Therefore when time came for \\"Spidey the movie\\", my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11-year-old-mania.<br />2. My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick. As a horrorfan his THE EVIL DEAD (1982) remains more or less as a gift. His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames. But I heard Raimi would be a bit more down-to-earth, in SPIDER-MAN. Well that sounded good.<br />Indeed, Raimi doesn't get all that carried away, even though the movie ooze from his fun directing manners. If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER-MAN has the same crazed tempo. Of course BRUCE CAMPBELL does a semi-cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions. Yeah, about the actors, SPIDER-MAN's lineup gives us three stars in the leading roles, Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors. Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character. Of course, to make an a-lot-of-fun-actionadventure these days requires some heavy artilleries from the digital front. True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment-meter. When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride. 'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this. Forget that it contains two love-declarations, one from Maguire and one from Dunst, that are absolutely ridiculous (and that the dialogues overall are no hotshots). Then you'll have a lot of fun. My rating is really a 7 out of 10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best.<br />Buy the way. There is a Spider-Man 2 and 3 coming up. Good idea. This movie was very true to the comicbook it was based on, but Spidey lacked his unresistable wits and some of the stuff that are basic to the Spidey-reader are not yet shown off in the movie. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels. Even though I wonder... Sam Neill as DocOc? Bring in Eddie Brock!ies from the digital front.

B000000993|3.0|I like this album, but in light of 'Aenima' and 'Lateralus' I think it was written before Tool had really matured. The musicianship is far inferior to those two albums, and the lyrics are more inconsistent, in spite of moments of inspiration. I recommend 'Lateralus' instead.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Listening to this CD, it's hard for me to believe it is Norah's first album. The singer/songwriter shows amazing range and vocal ability reminiscent of jazz legends Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. While I feel like this album might not adequately showcase the talents of young Ms. Jones, it definitely makes me look forward to her future releases. On Come Away with Me Norah does justice to old favorites like The Nearness of You, while at the same time creating instant classics out of her own originals, such as the title track. After hearing about this album from my dad, I feel I have gained a greater appreciation for her than even he has, proving Norah's ability to transcend strict music genres and generations, a talent exhibited in few musical artists. This album is an essential addition to any music lovers' collection.

6305971099|3.0|This movie would have gotten a better review from me if it was a little more realistic. I thought this movie was pretty scary, but what happened to the Myers House? All of a sudden, it's a huge mansion. Michael's mask is kinda funny looking too. &quot;Halloween&quot; fans should watch this, but will probably be slightly disappointed.
B00005UW7V|5.0|In Short:<BR>Pros:<BR>1: Solid and unique storyline revolves around social elements with good beginning and end and no prolonged dull moments.<BR>2: Appeal beyond strict special effects wizardry and sci-fi aspects.<BR>3: Excellent special effects and futuristic society depiction (this movie does depict the World Trade Center Twin Towers existing far in the future).<BR>4: A mixture of humor and serious cinema makes for a well rounded cinematic experience.<BR>5: When it comes to PG-13 movies many modern movies are much closer to R than to PG.  This movie is closer to a genuine PG-13 with scenes wholly appropriate to children without explanation while others will possibly provoke a family conversation about relationships, fairness, and parent/child love & loss.<br />Cons:<BR>Nothing significant in my opinion.<br />One of the central elements of this movie is the question of what constitutes life?  Given the ever increasing pace at which computer and other sciences are advancing some of the issues that are broached in this film may well come up in many peoples lifetimes.  Sure it's not likely to be exactly as depicted but quite frankly I don't write it off completely.  <br />I think this movie is a classic and I recommend it.<br />This is the story of a synthetic boy built by a future multinational as an alternative to having real children.  The world is a different place in the future with global warming having significantly melted the icecaps and flooded the coastal areas and radiation causing a rise in disease and infertility.  Androids are nothing new to this future society in fact they are cheaper than human beings and have largely replaced them as domestic servants and workers.  Most humans are forced to live on meager stipends while an elite develops the technology that drives the world economy such as androids.<br />As a test subject the company building this new revolutionary product offers it to an employee's family with a son suffering from an illness for which there is no cure (he is in stasis pending a cure at the movie's start).  While at first reluctant and even spooked the grieving mother eventually takes the synthetic child in to her home.  The process involves imprinting the face of the mother on the boys artificial consciousness and is irreversible, once done the boy will love the mother and treat her as his mother for eternity.  The boy never grows never changes he just loves his mommy in perpetuity.<br />Then a partial cure is found for the biological child and he is released from the futuristic hospital although still not 100% and aided by technology.  Initially they keep both boys but the biological one begins to be cruel to the artificial child immediately.  At the \\"real\\" boys birthday party his friends all seem to have picked up on his attitude toward his artificial sibling as being little better than a fancy talking teddy bear toy which he also owns and is cruel to (and he is the artificial child's best friend).  One of the children at the party decides to cut the android to see what he does and triggers a terror reflex with both the real child and synthetic sibling going into the pool and sinking like a stone because the terrorized robot is clinging hysterically to the real boy.<br />This is the turning point in the movie because the mother decides to get rid of the robot boy and drives him into the woods and abandons him there.  Remember that the boy is fixated on his mother figure and so begins a never-ending quest to become a real boy Pinocchio fashion.  His love of his mother is absolute and does not diminish or waver despite being thrown away.<br />The synthetic child quickly falls into an underground world where discarded robots are hunted down for parts and destroyed by angry economically displaced humans who are generally hostile and cruel to synthetics.  He begins his odyssey to become \\"real\\" with his trusty talking teddy bear at his side and the aid of a lover boy android in black synthetic leather.  The comparison between the boy and the gigolo drives home that the boy is supposed to be very special because people have a hard time telling he is in fact synthetic (the robot haters throw rotting vegetables at the man who wants to destroy him because he is crying and terrified in one scene).  Joe Gigolo leaves little doubt as to what he is however and he is pretty amusing.<br />It's an unusual movie really and the closest comparison I can think of is Bicentennial Man but I like this one better.  It may be because it's a story about a child that never grows up and never stops loving.  That is what is really the central aspect of his Artificial Intelligence is the love of his mother figure and the desire to win redemption in her eyes.<br />I recommend it for parents who would like to see a touching story and I recommend it for sci-fi fans as it is a unique movie and storyline and very different from most movies.  It might be harder for younger children to understand everything but they just might surprise you too so I would say it is a movie for families.
6305137293|5.0|I thought this was a very good sequel. I really liked how it took place the same night as the original. A lot of times sequels can be disappointing, but in my opinion, I think this is a very satisfying and scary sequel.
0440211727|5.0|Rarely am I hooked with a gut-wrenching reaction upon reading the first page, let alone the first paragraph, as I was with this book. <br />A 10-year old girl's vicious, heinous assault evokes a vigilante response from her father. Thus begins the trial both in and out of the court room. Is the murder of the two assailants of this little girl an act of temporary insanity or justifiable homicide? Therein lies the question that becomes unraveled in this riviting story. <br />Set in Mississippi, the characters include a pompous district attorney who uses this case for his own egotistical and political gain; a sympathetic defense attorney with integrity who puts his client first before his legal fees; a law clerk/student with liberal ideas and notions, wit and smart legal savy; the Ku Klux Klan, members of the black community from around the state, the media and the National Guard. One would think this is a setting out of the civil rights movement of the 60's, with scenes of demonstrations, rioting and killing of innocent people. This story in fact takes place in 1989 (the year the book was published).<br />My only critique is that the book was a bit lengthy at times. But overall, it's worth the read from beginning to end.
6305546789|5.0|This is a great horror movie. In my opinion, it's the best in the horror genre. It's scary and it has a great story. You should definetly see this movie if you like horror movies because you haven't seen a horror movie until you've seen &quot;Halloween&quot;.

B000002IST|2.0|OK, I know Genesis pretty well, and I honestly think no one should get this album until they already have several of the others.  They are extraordinarily talented musicians, and have made some fantastic stuff, but not here.  <br />If you're looking for mainstream top-40 pop, get Invisible Touch, then \\"Genesis\\", then probably this one<br />If you want a quality pop album with a touch of their 70's creativity, get Duke.<br />Their best combination of quality and accessibility is probably \\"A Trick of the Tail\\", my recommendation for someone looking to get into Genesis<br />Their overall best albums are probably Selling England by the Pound and the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, but these are tough to get into for the uninitiated<br />So, bottom line, I think this is one of their worst albums (better than Abacab or Calling All Stations, though).  If you've already tried the albums I've mentioned, maybe give this one a shot.  \\"No Son of Mine\\" is OK, and the rest is relatively formulaic adult contemporary pop.

0792833201|5.0|Meet the Freelings.  They are your average likeable suburban family living in an average suburban neighborhood living out the perfect suburban dream.  The father works as a real-estate agent, the mother is a happy homemaker, and the son and two daughters go to school.  On Sundays Mr. Freeling has his male buddies over to drink beer and smoke cigars while they watch the football game on TV.  On weekdays the kids gab and feud before going to school.  The kids have a great room filled with toys and posters.<br />But all is not as it seems in the Freelings' suburban paradise.  When little Carol Anne Freeling starts hearing voices coming from the television set and odd occurences start happening, the Freelings realize that supernatural beings have invaded their house.  And they're malignant.  Soon, the Freelings' suburban dream turns into a nightmare when little Carol Anne is kidnapped by the beings and held in a different dimension.  The Freelings must enlist the help of a trio of parapsychologists and a psychic midget if they are to get their daughter back.<br />This scary, thrilling horror film was co-produced and co-written by Steven Spielberg who also conceived of the story from an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Though Tobe Hooper is listed as the director, Spielberg seems to have had a David O. Selznick-like influence over Hooper.  Therefore, I do consider it to be a Spielberg film.  Indeed the film feels very Spielbergian.  There's the suburban setting, a story that deals with \\"aliens\\" (not extra-terrestrials), the child abduction, the mother who embarks on a quest to save her child.  All these elements have Steven Spielberg written all over them.<br />Besides being scary, the film manages to be quite funny in several place.  There's the scene where Steve Freeling and his neighbor feud with their remote controls, the scene where Diane Freeling is caught by her son smoking a joint, the scene where Steve accidentally knocks over his slimy boss' car.  These moments do much to keep the film from getting too grim.<br />The special effects are excellent.  They were created by George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic.  Jerry Goldsmith's score is also very good.  It is sometimes suspenseful and creepy, other times deceptfully lighthearted.<br />Certain scenes will likely have a lasting effect on you after the film is over.  You may develop a dislike of clowns.  You may also be tempted to get rid of your television set.
0375410341|4.0|I like odd books, and this one is the oddest of them all.  It was the first five words of the book that made me get it.  \\"This is not for you,\\" it just jumped off the shelf at me.  After the introduction and I hit the footnotes, I thought I was reading the greatest book ever writen in my lifetime.  After the innitial enthusiasm though, I've been able to clearly look at the book.  It is by far a great book, Danielewski deserves credit for an intreeging and creative story telling vehicle.  The story itself is strong, but the re-telling of it threw anilization after anilization, and seeing the effects the story has on people is rather intresting.  However, the footnotes which at first seem so great, start to trip you up as a reader after a while, making it difficult to focus on the story at hand.  That's not to say it's bad, but it slows the momentum down too much at times.  Still, it's not enough to really hurt the book and its inginuity.  It just takes some time.
B000001FRY|4.0|U2's first album is one of their best.  Every cut exudes energy especially tracks like \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"Electric Co.\\"  Bono's voice is raw and the Edge's guitar soars with his trademark galloping riffs.  I have always liked U2 but it's their early stuff that I really enjoy.  Buy either \\"Boy\\" or \\"War\\" and you won't go wrong.  Avoid \\"Rattle and Hum\\" and everthing after 1991's \\"Achtung Baby\\".
B00003W8NM|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was in my senior year of high school.  I'm a little bit older and wiser and after watching it over 100 times, I still find little intricate details that make the movie one of the best of all time.  <br />We are introduced to a so-called &quot;Fight Club&quot; with an overworked, underplayed insomniac, played by Edward Norton, and his spontaneous, hot, free living friend, Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt.  They meet under crazy circumstances, on a plane where Tyler describes why people's faces are so calm on the flight safety cards, and they end on insane ones as well.  I can easily say that the movie does not have one bit of happy-go-lucky kind of scenes.  Even the music in the background, provided by the Dust Brothers, brings the darkness to this movie and the backdrop of the ultimate &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  <br />So what's in store when watching the movie?  Nothing but blank stares and confused minds.  Believe me, its confusing the first time.  However, that is the essence of &quot;Fight Club.&quot;  It keeps you watching more and more to understand what the hell David Fincher wanted to bring out from the movie and its characters.  The plots twists and turns are only the beginning to this insomniac's dream turned into a nightmare and how he escapes that reality is the best part of the film.  <br />Maybe you'll leave the TV with a bored mind or one that will start a Fight Club of your own.  You never know.
1577311523|5.0|Enlightenment ushers in the realizations of being.  The import of the external world of perception fades while fear is revealed as illusory and the meaning of love is finally understood.  We come to know that we are love attempting to express upon a third dimensional (physical) reality.  Many of us grope, struggling in the darkness or worst, lost entirely within it while great teachers have repeatedly brought these truths to us.  The way to enlightenment is clearly shown by teachers such as Eckhart Tolle.  Those so inclined, do not wait for a friend to lend you Tolle's \\"book\\" nor should you consider the Tolle work just a book but a course on the Path and do not think that this \\"book\\" can just be read and put aside.  It should be used until its information is inculcated at the cellular level and the objective of enlightenment is accomplished.

B00000I2PG|5.0|Who else but Martin Fry &amp; Co. could produce &quot;Disco&quot; music with just the right amount of twists so that it survives for over 20 years as &quot;New Wave&quot;? This is, simply put, *the* best album ABC ever released. For me, it sums up 1982 perfectly -- I was in college, I had just bought an unbelievably clever new product by Sony called a &quot;Walkman&quot;, and I listened to this album everywhere I went. But memories aside, every track is a winner: the music is lively, the vocals are expressive and passionate, the lyrics are cleverly crafted, and the production is excellent. Some of my favorites are &quot;Look Of Love&quot; (of course), &quot;Poison Arrow&quot;, and &quot;Date Stamp&quot;. ABC would never again achieve this level of brilliance. Their next album, the truly awful &quot;Beauty Stab&quot;, proved this without a doubt. There were a few moments of greatness in later releases such as the songs &quot;Be Near Me&quot;, &quot;How To Be A Millionaire&quot;, &quot;The Night You Murdered Love&quot;, and a good portion of the &quot;Up&quot; and &quot;Abracadabra&quot; albums. But too many of the other tracks seemed like filler material and detracted from these particular gems as a whole. Rumors that ABC's been back in the studio have been floating around for a couple of years now. If it's true, let's hope they give us something that matches the excellence of &quot;The Lexicon Of Love&quot;.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|This album is absolutely the best album made in years. The disc hasn't left my player since i got it in February. Ryan Adams will it is true that he draws influences from Dylan, Neil, and the Stones, he is not a cheap imitation of those artists. He is completely orignal... at least in my opinion. His first solo album Heartbreaker was good but this album blows that one away.<br />I hear he is going to release some new harder stuff under a new band named \\"Pinkhearts\\".

B000002G7G|5.0|For their third album, the self-titled THE VELVET UNDERGROUND, Lou Reed got rid of both producer Andy Warhol and art-rocker John Cale.  And the result is a surprisingly melodic collection of soft ballads, thoughtful lyrics, and flashes of flat-out fun rock and roll that echos the sound of the band's previous recordings without actually repeating it in any discernable way.<br />This is the Velvet Underground's most accessible album, the one that most people first experience and find easiest to enjoy.  After opening with the meloncholy \\"Candy Says,\\" a song suggested by the musings of transexual Candy Darling, the band ramps up into a go-go beat with slightly mid-eastern guitar twists for my personal favorite on the album, \\"What Goes On\\"--and then settles into a series of equally memorable cuts that range from the soft beauty of \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" to the mantra-like \\"Jesus\\" to the good time \\"Beginning to See the Light.\\"  Whether upbeat or meloncholy, Lou Reed's unique style of talk-singing imparts a chant-like quality to the entire album, and although he has sometimes equaled these vocals in later work, he has never really bested them.  Of course, the Velvets wouldn't be the Velvets without out at least one truly far-out-down-right-weird selection, and they offer it with \\"The Murder Mystery,\\" a collage of conversation-like speech and lanquid singing that changes rhythms from moment to moment and which challenges the listener to sort out the individual voices and words.  And then the album wraps up with an unlikely 1930-ish tune, \\"Afterhours,\\" sung by drummer Maureen Tucker--and her completely unaffected, non-singer and off-key voice has surprising unstudied charm, rather like that of a school girl unaware that she is being recorded.<br />Even straight-laced pop fans will likely enjoy this particular album--and as such it is the perfect place for the uninitiated to begin a journey into The Velvet Underground.  Everything about it is beautifully done, and it is a welcome twist to the band's earlier, much edgier sound.  Strongly recommended, especially for first-timers.wist to the band's earlier, much edgier sound.  Strongly recommended, especially for first-timers.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I don't consider Britney Spears music as being the type of music that you play when you are alone with that special someone. But her music seems to connect more to teenagers who love to party and just have plain fun. Majority of the songs on the album are uptempo she tries to give a certain variety with songs like  \\"Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman\\". This release from Britney was a \\"Company\\" or Jive records release, it was not Britney waking up in the morning and saying \\"ah, I want to make a new album\\". The company is kind of pushing her to the limit instead of letting her cool out for a time and create some more compelling songs that will even make Britney haters want to listen. I consider the songs to be mostly fillers, they sound good but after the third play of the album you will begin to skip, this is typical of most albums today. <br />Still, there is  no need to hate her it's just music and she sounds just the same as she did in 1999 when \\"Baby One More Time\\" was released. Its just that we have gotten tired of her. I can vividly recall back in 1999 when everybody was rejoicing about this new face on the music seen, some of us started comparing her to Mariah Carey, some said her voice reminded them of \\"Billie Holiday\\" I laughed my guts out at that one, they even compared her to Celine Dion so in some sense its the freshness of the artiste that caused us to make Britney so \\"over popular\\". I consider  Baby One More Time to be some of Britney's best work to date with tracks like \\"Crazy\\", \\"Sometimes\\", Thinkin' About You\\" and the self titled track to be commendable pop songs. We all agreed that she sounds great on \\"Baby One More Time\\", so why are we dissing her now, my conclusion is that it might be the songwriters and not the voice. You can always have the perfect song but the voice does not always match, in this case its the songs.
B000055XMF|5.0|I think this movie is awesome &amp; how can anybody say that things were left out &amp; it didnt live up to the deepness of the cd how could they possibly know what the songs on the album are about they didnt write them nor sing them on stage.In Jimmy's external features shown throughout the movie he gradually breaks through the external shell &amp; u can see his deeper side coming through just at the end of the movie the music played throughout the beginning &amp; middle of the movie is Jimmy's deeper side an actor plays the external the music plays the inner struggle of Jim &amp; his mates.

B0000640VO|5.0|Pour moi, this film is the gift that keeps on giving. A sweet, romantic and inspiring modern classic, this French film is like comfort food. If a bad day is plaguing you, pop this one in and revel in its instant catharsis. Starring doe-eyed, instantly charming Audrey Hepburn incarnate Audrey Tautou as the shy but quirky main character, the viewer is instantly transported into her delicately colored, imaginative world. Amelie leads a quiet life, working as a waitress in a restuarant filled with dysfunctional characters, occasionally caring for her friend's cat and indulging in simple pleasures. Then one fateful day, her life changes forever. Upon finding a childhood keepsake and returning it to the owner, she becomes a secret guardian angel to the people around her. But while she can make others happy, she just can't seem to make things click with handsome stranger Nino (the talented and good looking Mathieu Kassovitz). The story plays out in a magical Parisan backdrop that only adds to the story's charm. The film is slow, sweet torture when it comes to the unfolding romance between Amelie and Nino, but when it gets to the climax, you can't help feeling amazing. Even when I watch this for the 100th time I get that heart-pumping, mind-blowing feeling of true love. So make a list of your likes and dislikes and indulge.
B00003CXTG|1.0|It's a pity really, that any film with the vast resources and talent that Pearl Harbor had should fail so spectacularly.  With the possible exception of the writer(s?) and director, the forces arrayed in making this film could have put together a true cinema classic.  Instead they turned it into a cocktail joke.<br />This is doubly sad, of course, because the historical events depcited here have so many natural and compelling stories (even fictions) that could and should be told.  I'm tempted to call this film an insult to those who served and/or died that day.  But that's not really fair.  The intentions here were good, the execution was lazy and sloppy.

B00005ATQD|4.0|On its release, Eyes Wide Shut was horrendously mis-marketed by virtually evberyone involved, especially Kubrick.  It found, and then lost, an early mass audience.  Despite this marketing failure, the film remains a powerful, haunting and deeply conservative vision of marriage, love and the implicit threat of human sexuality.<br />There are some who claim this film is strictly for Kubrick enthusiasts, that it is too weird, too unusual for them.  Well, there's no pleasing everyone, but one judge of the quality of a film is to try and discern how easy it is to look away, turn it off, walk out.  Kubrick's triumph is that his film is absolutely compelling.  You may hate it, but that gives you all the more reason to see where he'll go next.

B000065U1N|5.0|War is a terrible thing and one of the sad realities of modernity is that we've made war more efficient, more destructive and more complicated all at the same time.  The events depicted in the Mark Bowden book and Ridley Scott film, Black Hawk Down bear all of this out in excrutiating detail.<br />Judging the film without the benefit of (too much) context, it is easy to make one of two snap judgments about the film: it's either grossly racist or brilliantly realistic.  Of course, neither assumption is true, but in this case the truth does not quite come out in the middle.  <br />True, some of the events of the film are fabricated, altered from the book, but that's to be expected.  The film captures the essence of what it was like to be a Ranger or Delta Operator that day.  As such it changes some of the logistics, but to great effect.  It also leads to the wrong-headed criticism of the movie, that it is objectively racist.<br />Several professional reviewers made this claim and its unfortunate.  The movie boils down the events surrounding and on that day to focus almost exlusively on the perspective of the american combat soldier.  The fact is, there are a lot of stories that could be told about the Battle of the Black Sea, as there are about, say, the Battle of Little Big Horn or myriad other world events transmogrified into mass entertainment.  The fact that Ridley Scott and others made this version, their version, in no way stops someone from making a film from the opposite perspective.  Film is a tricky medium to pull off too many viewpoints succesfully, and art should never be subject to quotas or racial preferences.<br />This film is transfixing, world-altering and deeply affecting.  It is not, nor should it be, the last work on the United States' involvement in Somalia.  It is just, flat out, a tremendous movie.
B000068FY0|5.0|The band poured every ounce of creativity into this album, and then slid steadily downhill from that moment on.  Their subsequent albums got weaker and weaker, but this is the real deal.<br />Crime of the Century is a perfect album - the music and lyrics fit together perfectly, and the production and musicianship is top class.<br />An all-time top 10!
B00005JKQZ|3.0|This is a fine movie, a good film, watchable, enjoyable, entertaining and, at times, informing.  What it is not is groundbreaking, compelling, affecting or, simply, great.<br />Russel Crowe's performance was typically good, but nowhere near his stunning turn in The Insider.  In this movie he is playing the troubled genius, and there's really nothing all that new to his performance.<br />Beyond Russel Crowe, everything else is sort of facile.  Technically well executed, the film simply doesn't have the impact that many of it's reviews--and accolades--would seem to indicate.
B0000039PW|4.0|When I bought the album and I was listening to it and it got to track #7 \\"ONE MORE CHANCE\\" I was a little bit ... because I remember that song being slower tempo maybe im confusing for a remix but i've heard it on the radio and they played a different version and I really like that version more it even had different lyrics I just became a rap fan 3yrs ago . As for the cd must for every rap fan biggie is one of the illest, favorite tracks Warning and Juicy this CD should be in everybodies cd collection if u don't have it your not true rap fan the lyrics proved biggies leadership of the EAST and the life he had to live in the struggle.
0783240503|4.0|I ordered this video to use as a wrap-up for a unit I was doing on musicals with my 3rd and 4th graders.  They really enjoyed watching it and absolutely loved the music.  For many, this was their first exposure to a musical.  There were some parts where the women were very &quot;scantily clad&quot;, and that, of course, got a big reaction out of them - I reassured them that the actresses were wearing costumes to make them &quot;look like they're not wearing anything.&quot;  Even being a pro actor myself, I have little criticism for this video.
0793927501|5.0|Just want to write a letter to say how I just viewed the Edge and man is this is great movie. I have never been out to Alaska or Vancouver where I heard this movie was filmed but the scenery is awesome. Finest movie I have ever seen and very well directed and script is also believeable. This could happen to you and me, I mean this movie is so realistic. I have always been a big fan of Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins and these two Superstars are great together, they need to make more movies together.Mr Tamborini are you going to make a Part 2 to this movie? If you do Anthony Hopkins has to be in the movie along with that beautiful lady who played the part of his wife.
B000066NW0|2.0|I have to admit...on first hearing 'Complicated' on the radio, I thought that Avril Lavigne was a pretty good pop singer along the lines of maybe Vanessa Carlton. But after seeing the video, and the interviews, etc...TRL's &quot;Skate-Punk Princess&quot; was wearing a little thin. Her songs are watered down Alanis Morissette. I downloaded songs from this album expecting radio-friendly pop-punk. I got Mandy Moore in Hot Topic clothes instead. Songs like 'Things I'll Never Say' and 'I'm With You' contain none of the punk she professes to be. 'Sk8tr Boi' has the most overused chords, etc. ever. And the lyrics? &quot;He was a boy, she was a girl/Can I make it any more obvious?&quot; No, Avril, you cannot.<br />I gave this CD two stars because her image has successfully hoodwinked a lot of the media into thinking she's some kind of 'punk.' Congrats to her record label. Her voice isn't all that bad but the material she sings is, pretty much. If you want pop-punk fronted by girls, at least get some Element 101.
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento is one of the best suspence thrillers out there today. Full of questions and mystery follow Lenord Shelbe(Guy Pearce) through he's life in the world of shortterm memory loss, which means that he remembers everything up to his injury(during a struggle to save his wife) but he can't make new memories. Everything just fades. The movie is shown backwards with lits bits of footage in the middle. Director, Christopher Nolan brings you into a new world where your friends could be your enemies or the other way around. If you like this movie check out other films from the same director such as &quot;Following&quot;. There was only one thing wrong with the movie and that is the confusing DVD title section. You have to go through a bunch of mind games just to get the movie started and the special features are even harder. I suggest you buy the other Memento DVD and save your money.
0767827716|3.0|this is a good movie but not close enough to the book.<BR>However i still liked and would say to people they should see it
6305841861|5.0|If there is one movie I could be stranded with on an island it would be this one. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell created one of the best horror movies ever. With a good mixture of gore and slapstick style comedy. The story is a sequal/remake of the first except this time there is a bigger budget. This is the type oif film you could watch over and over again with your friends and have the same impact as the first time seeing. The DVD doesn't have the best bonus features but the commentary is the funniest. Bruce, Sam, and Rob will make you think you were there during the making of it. Horror lovers around the world will laugh and scream through this crazy movie by the director of Spiderman and the Xena series.
B00005K9LN|5.0|&quot;British Steel&quot; is totally immortal! <br />This album is about P O W E R. It simply spells it right through. Every song is a total classic. Every riff commands you to shake, every chorus you find yourself singing along. This is blood, sweat, tears, and steel. <br />This album is pure genius. I imagine, if I were in a band, making an album like British Steel, would be the ultimate challenge. Write a killer riff, base the song around it, adding timeless hooks and an utterly catchy chorus. Repeat this procedure ten times. Very, very seldom does bands accomplish this. Pure genius, and alot harder than writing non memorable songs where riffs are all over each other. <br />I originally bought this album 18 years ago. Earlier this year I got all the JP re-masters, and British Steel sounds better than ever (actually they all do). I really think changing the track list was beneficial as well. Ive found myself putting on British Steel, and just soak in its P O W E R. Totally engulfed in it´s genius. Pure magic.
B00004YKSD|4.0|Somewhere in the beginning of the movie, Ray Manzarek, keyboard player for the Doors, says to Jim Morrison that \\"we've gotta make the myths\\".  If Morrison by the end of his life wasn't a myth already, he sure is now, thanks to Oliver Stone's take on his short but shall we say intense life.<br />As always, there's been a lot of controversy about Stone's historical inventions (cfr. JFK and Nixon), but then I don't think that reality was really the point anyway. What Stone pulled off here was to make a movie out of the music of The Doors, using its sensibilities and surreal images. Morrison's life is just the thread that runs through it all, and where the facts are given a wide berth, atmosphere takes over. Boy, does it ever - I think that watching The Doors is about as close as you can get to experiencing an acid trip without actually taking LSD. It's visually kinetic and obviously there's all of that music - 135 minutes worth of it. Don't watch it to get to know Jim Morrison; watch it to understand the music and the era from which it came. And watch it to see Val Kilmer's uncanny portrayel of Morrison, arguably one of the finest acting jobs ever done based on a real person.<br />DVD treatment is fine, with a crystal clear transfer of the movie - just too bad it wasn't enhanced for 16:9 tv's. Extra's include a surprisingly honest making-of, The Road Of Excess, director's commentary with Oliver Stone still thinking himself a genius (hey, watcha gonna do?) and 43 minutes worth of deleted scenes - most of which deserved their fate.
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is a very, uh, \\"nice\\" recording.<br />It's full of pretty folk-jazz Americana stylings of the sort that Cassandra Wilson has done so well (e.g. Blue Light 'Til Dawn, Full Moon Daughter). Well-crafted textures of well-played acoustic guitars, piano, etc. Lots of open space. Gentle stuff, mostly. The songs are a pleasant mix of originals and covers, and although none are true standouts, they're all easy on the ears.<br />So go on - get it. It's not going to offend anyone, except possibly those who expect too much (i.e. overly influenced by the ASTONISHING amount of Norah Jones hype), or who think everything on Blue Note must be conventional jazz (which this is not). <br />At the same time, it's also not likely to fill anyone with passion. Something's missing here. There are sparks without flame, warmth but little heat. It's a safe version of Cassandra Wilson - no danger, no lust. no pain and not much intensity.<br />How good is Norah Jones, really? I don't yet know whether this is a guilty pleasure or the breakout of someone special. But having gotten over the hype, I don't really care -- I love the recording. We'll have to wait for another release to find out what she can deliver as she matures.
B00005OAIE|4.0|A highly recommended, well-produced debut album. The music is rich and fresh, the contrived squarish image hurts the lyrics a bit, but the voice and the music compensate.<br />The main question -- can he top this one with his next album. Now's the time to see John in concert in small venues. Hopefully this fellow will go far.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|While many complain that Ron Howard whitewashed much of John Nash's life in A BEAUTIFUL MIND, those same fail to acknowledge that the film as it stands is in and of itself quite a strong picture. And while those same people scream of sentimentality throughout, there is nothing here that suggests anything sentimental or even likable about the person of John Nash. Granted, there are a few moments where scenes with his wife teeter on sappy, but overall I think the film depicts rather well the horror that must have been, and still is, Nash's life as a schizophrenic. The acting is uniformly excellent--Russell Crowe shows far more of his capability(and should have got the Oscar) here as an actor than in GLADIATOR The supporting cast is also first-rate--Jennifer Connelly gives a quiet, beautifully restrained performance as Alicia Nash(and I think it's safe to say the Oscar wasn't completely unjustified), and there's also equally fine work from Ed Harris, Paul Bettany, and Christopher<br />Plummer. Best Picture of the year? Nope, that would have been LORD OF THE RINGS. But I think this is a solid second choice.
B000002VCB|2.0|An album necessary if you are a completist, but the album draws too strongly on the negative aspects of relationships. The theme tires.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I loved it!!  I actually love the game and was thrilled that at times you almost feel as if you're playing it!  It's good, trashy fun, great scenes with lots of zombies(my favourite), basically just great entertainment!!
B00000J7I3|4.0|TOO FAST FOR LOVE, by MOTLEY CRUE was their first album they released and they did it without any help from any of the major record companies at the time. This album has all the elements that would later go on to become part of the trademark Motley sound, sex, drugs and of course living a great lifestyle. Now that it has be remastered and re-released with bonus tracks, I highly recommend this for all you Motley fans and for any music fans at all. There are some killer trakcs on this album: TOO FAST FOR LOVE, LIVE WIRE, STARRY EYES, and PIECE OF YOUR ACTION are what I think are the standout tracks here. We also get to previously unreleased tracks that I think totally rock, TOAST OF THE TOWN and an alternate intro to TOO FAST FOR LOVE. This album has great music, killer songs and a killer attitude and I think all rock fans should enjoy this
0316666343|5.0|This was a truly great read!  I usually like a quick read, and I wouldn't classify this as such; but it was still wonderful!  It was not what I had expected (nor did it end that way) but it was still a great ending...comfortable is how I would describe the ending.  I won't usually re-read books, but this is definitely one I will re-read in the future.  <BR>I've already lent it to a friend and have another waiting in the wings for it to be available.  <BR>I would definitely recommend reading it!  Take the plunge and buy it now...don't wait for the paperback...
B000063DI8|1.0|I can clearly see what Steve Harris was thinking after the classic Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son. Maiden was going towards a very progressive path, and had reached its limit in this field. It was time for a change. And by change, in this case, Harris tought of a back to basics approach: raw and straight to the point.<BR>We all know now that Adrian Smith did not agree with that, and was replaced by Janick Gers, a guy that really can play raw. Basically, that´s all he can do.<br />But what people did not know is that the &quot;raw&quot; sound pursued by Harris would result in the worst set of songs ever recorded by Maiden up to that point. They, without exception, have absolutely no merits. The album included one their worst songs ever, BRING YOUR DAUGHTER TO THE SLAUGHTER. HOLY SMOKE is also poor, MOTHER RUSSI is a ludicrous attempt to write an epic song in the veins of Rime and Alexander.<BR>As for the new guitarrist, he can´t be blamed for that, because he did not write any of them.
B000059TEQ|5.0|This is the classic story of Oliver (Ryan O'Neal) and Jennifer (Ali MacGraw), the star crossed lovers whose simple romance is one of the most beautiful stories ever told on film.  Oliver is a rich, mildly arrogant hockey playing Harvard student who falls for Jennifer, a poor wisecracking, slightly profane, Radcliffe student.  The two begin dating, fall in love, and marry, much to the consternation of Oliver's parents, who cut him off financially.  Oliver struggles through law school on Jennifer's salary as a teacher.  Upon graduating, Oliver gets a good job at a high powered law firm and Jennifer quits teaching in the hopes that she can become pregnant.  Then, fate intervenes.  Jennifer is diagnosed with leukemia and their world is destroyed.  The musical score is hauntingly dramatic.  All of the cast give great performances, particularly Ray Milland as Oliver's father and John Marley as Jennifer's lonely father, Phil.  Also recommended is &quot;Oliver's Story&quot;, the sequel film, which is not a very good film except that it allows you to see what happens to Oliver in the aftermath of his loss.
B00000DCHI|5.0|While Billy Joel is very much an album artist, despite his many hit singles, this is a fine collection of a great American songwriter's most commercially succesful work. All the while, the true fan knows that un-included songs like 'Summer, Highland Falls', 'Vienna', 'All for Leyna', 'Laura' and many others are easily just as good as most of the songs collected here. It's still astonishing to sample the man's compositional range and ever-fecund tunefulness. Had he been born 50 years earlier he would be revered along with Irving Berlin, Gershwin and Jerome Kern. Since he belongs to the rock era we have to tolerate un-informed condemnations of his work because it doesn't 'rock' correctly. <BR>This is strong, memorable music folks, written by a pop genius who still has much more to give.
B0000640VO|1.0|Did I mention it is boring.  BTW you must also speak French to fully appreciate how boring this movie is.  It may just be a joke on the Americans.
0312954468|5.0|I have just finished RiverGod and although I must say I absolutely adore Wilbur Smith's writing style (The depth of his characters and landscape). Taita is one of the best characters I have ever had the pleasure of journeying with. Slave though he may be he is certainly rich in many other forms. Anyone who is interested in Ancient Egypt really should read this and the other 2 Egyptian books by Mr Smith (Warlock &amp; Seventh Scroll). The culture is absolutely amazing and in a lot of ways it reminds me of Jean Auels books in the way that new things are discovered and used. The most amazing thing to me was when I reached the end of the book and found that it was based on an archelogical find (10 Scrolls). Fiction is definately my forte however finding even the smallest truth in such an amazing story just makes it even better.
B000069CWE|2.0|I love Linkin Park. Hybrid Theory is by far one of the best albums I've ever listened to in my life, musically and lyrically. So naturally I bought Reanimation becasue I loved Hybrid Theory.<BR>BIG MISTAKE.<BR>Points of Authority was an exception, but any song that the fellas from LP don't remix are pitifull. LP should have never let rap artist re-mix their songs. They take liberties: add in words, cut out words..ect. The remixers are really re-doing the songs, not re-mixing them. Take &quot;In the End&quot; for example. In the first few seconds of the song, we hear a rapper telling us that in the beginning, it was just Linkin Park. But then, it was...'Oh SHUT UP!' Quit trying to take the glory for the re-mix! It's so stupid how most mixers just screw up the songs. <BR>So if you have Hybrid Theory, keep it. But don't waste your time with this awful album. About 4 good songs isn't worth your time or money. Just wait until the boyz from LP come out with an album that only THEY do.
B00005OAIE|5.0|...  This is a great CD for any time.....the car, a cookout, cleaning the house, a party, WHEREVER.  Get one for yourself, grab one for a friend.  This is refreshing music.
B000067CPX|5.0|Do yo want to get an album that you can't let go of?  Well this is the album for you.  If you have ever liked any of \\"The Red Hot Chili Peppers\\" music, this album is like a greatest hits with a lot of variety.  When I had first heard the album, i thought that it might not be one of there best, but like all of thee albums, it took a few listens to really enjoy it. I have now heard the album atleast 4 times a day since its release. It is absolutely the best album of all time.  It will take a little while for everybody to spread the news.  <BR>   I have given a 1-100 review rating system since it is such a great album. 90-100 definetley are classics!!<br />90-By The Way-This song is definetley all there music combined.<BR>              I didnt like this song after they played it on <BR>              the radio a million times. but it grows on you.<BR>91-Universally speaking-This song has a great chorus.It sounds <BR>                        like a christmas song.<BR>99-This is the place-verry addictive!!great bass line.<BR>100-dosed-This will be a classic.

B000063S6Z|4.0|I (like many others) got on the Moby bandwagon with PLAY, his last release.  I thought that Play was an extraordinary CD.  18, I feel is (just?)a very good one.  Moby does not exactly follow the same path in the making of this release as PLAY, however there are definate parallels. The use of soulful vocals layered over synth washes and funky beats are a constant.  But whereas PLAY featured old gospel vocals, 18 goes with a R&amp;B feel. 18 is more of a subdued recording, but plays well as a whole.  Not being a techno or electronica purist I don't see Moby as a sellout, but as someone who is blurring the boundries of that genre and making it more accessible to the non-purist.  Also his essays included in the CD jacket always provide interesting reading.
068484267X|1.0|Firstly: we already know how the story ends, though we may not know how the book ends.  He grows up, writes a boo-hoo story, and gets rich.  It may be too late since it's been out for a long time and made into a movie and all that, but if it's not too late: DON'T READ THIS BOOK.  Secondly: I don't know how it won the Pulitzer.  It was not well written.  Thirdly :It was so boring I couldn't finish it.  Granted, great books are often boring.  Moby Dick, for example.  Took me weeks to read that, but at least it was WELL WRITTEN.  My dad said \\"give it time, it gets better.\\"  I said, You mean sadder?  \\"yeah, that's what I mean.\\"  Give me a break.  Let's all feel sorry for rich Frank McCourt who has more money than we've ever seen.
B00005JKJA|2.0|Okay! I'll admit I liked, no I loved the girl-girl scenes between Laura Harring and Naomi Watts (especially the bedroom one). Besides those, there was no other good part to the movie. I think the ending [stunk] majorly, not summing up the story in any way, and the whole name change thing was confusing. Tere are some people that liked this movie, and who am I to argue, I can understand liking it for its mystery, it just wasn't my type of movie.
B000009DUY|5.0|John Williams, in perhaps his most moving score to date, has delighted the hearts of millions with his score, only they hardly noticed it.<br />We all heard the tunes, those beautifully majestic melodies that flew swiftly at us as we watched Saving Private Ryan, only some of us really paid attention.  If you're here and reading this now, I can only assume you were one of those score lovers who truly heard this deeply gripping music from Saving Private Ryan.<br />This score is, without doubt or exception, one of the most powerful musical soundtracks in recent memory.  It is well worth the buy and is as magical listening to it via cd player as it was hearing it for the first time at the box office.<br />You will love this cd.
B00002E23E|1.0|Led Zeppelin is my favorite band, however, this movie was horrible.  Plot needs major work and the sound quality was not the best (my vinyl LP's are almost better).  I would say just buy the soundtrack on CD and you will enjoy it better.  Don't buy this DVD just because it is Led Zeppelin, like I did.  It's not worth it.
078322818X|5.0|...his film career.  Richard Dreyfuss does a marvelous job as the nastolgic Curt Henderson. He single handedly makes this film perfect.<br />In this film, Curt and his bud, played by Ronnie Howard, are finally done with school and both contemplating their futures.<br />The boys make their \\"last night\\" in their hometown enjoyable by hanging with friends at the food hop, revisiting their old lockers, racing other kids up and down the strip, all while knowing fully well that they are done with highschool and the reality that comes with knowing that they can't go back to their old school days.<br />I never lived in the sixties, having been born in 1980, but I can see what life might have been life for those of you who did by watching this film.  It's funny, heart warming, well acted, and extremely well written. My hat goes off to the cast and crew.<br />This is perhaps the most delightful movie for the look-back-at-the-sixties genre. I highly recommend this film to all of you.
0380820846|3.0|Julia Quinn is an excellent writer, and I enjoy her books a great deal. However, this particular book, \\"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\\", is not her best.<br />I'm not saying it's bad ... you won't put this book away unfinished. However, you may find yourself to be annoyed by this book along the way.<br />She does a lot of cutesy (asides) in the first chapter. It was bad writing and I'm surprised it wasn't edited out.<br />The dialogue in the book overall is too self-consciously precious, and the characters sound too awkwardly witty. It's simply not believable! The book is devoid of sensuality because Ms. Quinn is too busy trying to be cute.<br />I liked the Whistledown stuff -- it's impossible not to like! --and it was fun how Ms. Quinn borrowed from other genre authors.<br />However, the book is very light, self-conscious fare, and you don't really feel compelled to turn the pages the way you do with Ms. Quinn's other offerings.<br />Ms. Quinn plays a cheap trick on the readers at the end, using the mysterious actions of one of her characters to keep her readers hanging. OK, I'll admit her dime novel technique worked -- I'll pick up the next book for sure -- but it wasn't really a shining example of good writing.<br />I don't know ... I just expect more from Ms. Quinn. Better luck next time, I guess!

B00006F2TV|5.0|With everything from action to suspense even romance, Spiderman has everything for people of ALMOST all ages. You may want to keep the kiddies away from all the violence and occasional swearing, but it is overall a great movie. Staying true to the comics, this Spiderman film is due for two more sequals while the comics keep coming out. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko are the original creators of the Spiderman comic series that Marvel released in the mid-60's, and it has spawned tv shows, spinoff comics, memorabilia, and movies. Tobey Maguire(don't think I spelled that right) and Kirsten Dunst(don't think I spelled that right, either) are incredible together. Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and falls in love with Mary Jane, until the Green Goblin seeks revenge on the company rivaling his. Spiderman and his friends become intertwined into this incredible storyline of betrayal, suspense, and .... evilness.
B000000WF0|4.0|This group is the result of what happens when you take one too many night time pain relievers. This group would have been better suited having existed in the late sixties but hey, for the sake of all us youngsters, I'm glad they are around in my day and age.<br />Urban Hymns is a solid cd based on drugs, psychodelic paranoia, and a free lifestyle. Although I'm hardly a drug user, I still found the songs to be very good road trip anthems.  It's nicely crafted, with Bitter Sweet Symphony taking on the role of \\"catchy song.\\"  If you like Oasis or Coldplay(both from the UK), this is your next stop on the road to music satisfaction.<br />BEWARE: Bitter Sweet Symphony is only one of about three songs that's background music if electronic on this cd. Most of the songs are accustic.

If you like to pretend that dumb MTV movies(garbage) are funny then you'll love this movie(or at least pretend)in front of your friends. If you are smart then you will realize that this is a terrible film that's not funny at all.
B000007OY0|5.0|Bare with me for a moment if you will. I do have a point. Think back to when you were a kid.  If you're a guy, then you'll know all about our know-holds-bar attitude towards keeping away from the little girls, after all, they did have \\"kooties.\\"  Well, remember that time you first discovered you thought little Jennifer or Emily was kind of.....cute? The other boys would pick on her and call her a kootie-face but you stood up for her, ever though it meant envoking the wrath of every guy-friend you had during that time.  Well, years later, when little Jenny or Emily grew up and became a complete hottie and she didn't forget the way you took up for you? Remember the feeling you had when everyday she passed you in the halls and gave you the smile that she saved only for you? Well, that's the way Shawshank will make you feel at the end: complete satisfaction my friend, complete satisfaction, even if it meant feeling low in some points.<br />The film takes you into ...(or so it seems for Andy Dufresne) but before it's all said and done, leaves you on the doorstep of heaven, and just in time for the gate to swing open. Yes, this is one of those yummy films.<br />In it, we can feel the complete desperation of Andy Dufresne(played perfectly by Tim Robbins) and we can see deep into his heart, witnessing his pain, his agony, and helplessness. Just about the time when we feel all's lost for poor Andy, we get to take one of the sweetest breaths of fresh air that a movie has ever handed out.  It's just plain tastey!<br />The plot is the stuff of Pulitzer Prizes. Dufresne is accused of killing his wife, thrown in jail for life, and forced to deal with a group of corrupt guards, a gang of rape-minded prisoners, and a warden who is the embodiment of evil.  Sound like fun? Believe me, it is.<br />Andy meets up with \\"Red\\" Redding(played magnificently by Morgan Freeman) and soon the two become very good friends.  After a few years of getting raped and abused by other inmates, Dufresne learns that his special knowledge(bank management) can go a long way in helping him keep from being assaulted anymore.  He helps the guards with their taxes and becomes the warden's assistant, only this means he has to deal with dirty money and soon, a dramatic climax develops.<br />Hands down my favorite movie of all time, The Shawshankk Redemption(first set in the fourties) will leave you standing up in applause by the time the end credits role around.  The cast is electrifying, the plot flawless, and the musical score a complete gem(done handsomely by Thomas Newman).<br />NOTE: How much do I love this film? Tons. Enough to go find out where it was really shot. Mansfield, Ohio, ladies and gentlemen, is the town where the prison actually resides. Every part of the film was shot in or around Mansfield and yes, I plan on going there very soon. ENJOY!sne learns that his special knowledge(bank management) can go a long way in helping him keep from being assaulted anymore.

0316666343|5.0|I approached this book with caution since I expected to find it too harrowing. The summary reviews outlined the violence to the main character and I was concerned that the author would dwell on this too much.<br />In the end, I read it in two sessions. As others have noted, I was moved to tears and laughter on several occasions. The storyline moved at a fast pace and was well narrated by the teen character.<br />I also liked the fact that it wasn't all neatly tied up at the end. I'll be interested if Hollywood changes this when it makes it to the big screen. (And there's no doubt in my mind that it will).<br />Heartily recommended. I rate it as a favorite on par with Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier and I look forward to future work by Ms. Sebold.
6300214753|5.0|As a child of the eighties(literally, I was born in '80), I don't remember seeing this film at the theatre. I did, however, watch the rented version over and over again with pals on fun summer nights.  I fell in love with it back then, and I'm still in love with it today.<br />Contrary to what some have said, this film is an all-time classic. It stands amongst the elite films in its decade and will always be mounted on the movie trophy wall with the likes of The Breakfast Club, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Risky Business, and a few others.<br />This film, in case you are one of the rare folks who hasn't seen it, focuses on a high school know-it-all and the day he skips school, finding himself having a blast in Chicago(MY HOME TOWN).<br />This is a fun film in every sense of the word. You will love it and if you were a child of the eighties, you'll probably cheerish it forever.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Pinnochio is one of the best animated Disney film.  It is thrilling frightening Dark and light hearted.  It is beautiful and funny.  You probably already know the story.  Gepetto makes a puppet that comes alive.  He is inquisitive and cute.  But he wants to be a real boy.  it has great songs not to mention Disney's most popular song the Disney theme Song, when you wish upon a star.  Get this.  One of the best films of all time Disney animated or not.  A timeless clasic that can withstand the test of time!
B000063S6Z|5.0|Despite the other reviews, I honestly believe that 18 is better than any Moby cd previosly conceived. 18 clearly focuses on a more spiritual realm with tracks like In My Heart and I'm Not Worried At All.  There are about four tracks that contain black choir type sounds and lyrics, and oh what a welcomed addition it is.<br />If you enjoyed the tracks from Play like Why Does My Heart Hurt So Bad, Natural Blues, and My Weakness, than you won't be dissapointed with 18. There are around eight tracks with that kind of music on this cd. Other standouts from this cd are One of These Mornings, Another Woman, Sunday, and Rafters.
B000000XCD|5.0|If you own anything by The Band, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, the Eagles, or early Van Morrison, then hopefully you already have this album.  But whether you know it or not, this is essential rock.  As long as there is rock music, people will be rediscovering CCR.  Rolling Stone called them the \\"greatest american singles band.\\"  On Green River, CCR transcends that label and by the time they've ripped through the 9 songs you'll be very tempted to hit \\"repeat\\" (go ahead).  The opening of \\"Tombstone Shadow\\" sends chills down my spine.  John Fogherty's wailing late- sixties guitar swims over one of the best rhythm sections you will ever hear in a rock band.  This band is often dismissed by \\"serious\\" critics due to their high radio profile, but they stand alongside The Band as one of the essential american rock bands.  Sure, they were from California, but when you listen, you have to believe John Fogherty's classic impassioned voice springs straight from a soul that was right out of the heartland, wherever that may be.
6304169558|4.0|Is it just me or is Helen Hunt an annoying actress? As for the film, there is great action and solid special effects.  It's just that Helen Hunt is so obnoxious in her role in this film.<br />Bill Paxton does a solid job but one can't help but realize the nose dive his career took after this film was done. Oh well. Twister might have you wanting to become a storm chaser when it's all said and done. I know I gave it some thought.
6304708521|1.0|Well as far as a film goes this is pretty stupid. However, I own a copy &amp; would never trade it in.<br />I'm a Beatles fan - &amp; if I look at this not as a film but as a collection of music videos then it's well worth it - especially for &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;.<br />There's no screenwritting credits for this because there was no real script. Paul McCartney &amp; Ringo Starr decided to fill a bus with interesting people - &amp; film it - &amp; wait for the magic to happen.<br />The magic never happened in so far that a 'movie' didn't emerge - just a lot of disjointed imagery.<br />But this is a must for a Beatles nut like myself.
630018403X|5.0|This is it, the one and only. This is the cornerstone of all eighties movies, fresh with its witty humor, solid message, and fine collection of young eighties stars.<br />It is the story of five kids, five very different kids and the day they were forced to spend together in Saturday detention.  We have Judd Nelson as the punk, or at that time, stoner boy; Molly Ringwald as the school princess; Emilio Estevez as the super jock; Anthony Michael Hall as the nerd; and Ally Sheedy as the no-name freak.  It's quite a collection and, with the smart and sassy script, creates one of Hollywood's most engrossing films of the eighties and beyond.<br />If there is a remote chance you haven't seen this movie via TNT, Blockbuster, or TBS, I highly recommend this flick. It is funny, sad, intriguing, and most of all, is the hallmark of every eighties teen film, surpassing even the likes of Ferris Bueller's Day Off and yes, even Fast Times at Ridgemont High.<br />You can't go wrong with The Breakfast Club. Be warned, though, there are plenty of vulgar words and sexual innuendos in this film but hey, that just comes with the territory.<br />Note: this film also provides one of the greatest eighties songs of all time, Don't You Forget About Me by the Simple Minds. ENJOY!!
6304708491|3.0|The first of the Beatles colour cinematic outings, Help actually is quite funny.<br />Co-starring the late great Leo McKern (better know outside the USA), the Beatles are pursued by a religious sect after a sacred ring which just happens to be on 'you-know-who's' finger.<br />I'm surprised though that this is so expensive!
B000068FXX|5.0|1977's \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\" finds Supertramp going for a more piano & acoustic-guitar based, orchestral sound (hinted at by the snow-covered grand piano on the album cover), and putting aside their trademark Wurlitzer keyboard entirely. But don't worry, the band still leave room for rock as well. \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\" is another wonderful, classic disc from Roger Hodgson, Rick Davies and the Trampers, with such classic tunes as the Hodgson signature \\"Give A Little Bit,\\" the totally gorgeous title song, the equally-gorgeous \\"Downstream\\" (a great solo showcase for Davies), \\"From Now On,\\" and the stunning finale, the 11-minute suite, \\"Fool's Overture,\\" a true rock masterwork.\\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\" is yet another winner from Supertramp. What more can I say about it---just buy it! :-)
0393317552|5.0|The introduction of this book starts in a questionable manner (the author - subjectively - claims the new-guineans are smarter than westerners!).<br />The rest of the book more than makes up for it. Diamond has done an enormous amount of data gathering and analysis. In my opinion, he's done a great service to mankind (and people like me). The stuff you will find in this book is of universal interest (in my opinion), but very hard to classify and hence tough to find in one place. Could be compared to Godel Escher Bach (but maybe not in the same class as an intellectual effort). Kudos to him. <br />Just btw: it won a Pulitzer too.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Unlike a lot of people I actually really enjoyed this movie.<br />Okay, so it didn't follow the HG Well's book, and it isn't a patch on the original \\"Time Machine\\" movie but all the same it still made good and fun watching.<br />Guy Pierce was excellent as the tormented Alexander Hartdegen who builds a time machine so he can change history after his girl friend is cruelly murdered<br />The special effects were top notch, the Morlocks were deliciously vicious and cannibalistic whilst Jeremy Irons was superb as Uber-Morlock, a creature so removed from his human roots he is no longer human.<br />A brilliant scene in the film is when Alexander goes into a futuristic library and speaks to a hologram called Vox about time travel who remembers him 800,000 years later when the world that once was is no more.<br />Another haunting and memorable scene is when Alexander watches the moon break up, fragmenting in the sky and thus changing the course of human history where humanity will evolve yet again, but this time into the gentle Eloi and the vicious and murderous Morlocks.<br />All the cast were excellent, with Mark Addy, playing Alexander Hartdegen's loyal but bewildered best friend David Philby and Phyllida Law giving a good rendition of Mrs. Watchit the stern but loving Housekeeper.<br />The real stars of the film for me though were the Mumba siblings, with Samantha portraying Mara the young Eloi girl who befriends the man from the past and fights to save her younger brother Kalen played her real life brother Omero Mumba from the Morlocks.<br />The music score was even better than the music, and fitted in really well, it will be one of the few Moview Soundtracks that I will buy, I'm very fussy about my music you see!<br />All in all this is pretty good film and it is a real shame it has been panned so much by the critics.  Well worth renting if you don't want to buy it.
0553106635|5.0|Martin will ruin your ability to read most other fantasy books. He is a very skilled writer and spins an incredibly deep tale. His world is full of political intrigue and interesting characters.<br />The one weakness is what began as one of his strengths: His willingness to kill off even good characters. (In contrast to other writers in this genre like Jordan who's main characters seem to have a dome of invulnerability permanently around them.) It has gotten so bad you fear to attach yourself to anybody in the books emotionally because when they step forward as a likable character you know the END is near for them.
B00005R87Q|4.0|I never thought that this movie would be this good.  I must confess that I rented it strickly based on the previews of the awesome Dodge Charger that was in the previews.  As the movie pulled me in I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually a good move.  Kind of a cross between American Grafitti, Top Gun and the Shriley Muldowny story, lol.<br />This is a fascinating, action packed, racing movie about the generation of street racers that are around today.  Similar do the older generations drag strips to a point.  Intertwined with the street racing was an undercover, good cop helping the \\"good\\" bad buy type of script.  The \\"betrayal\\" of the good girl ect. <br />Overall, a very good movie with fast cars, girls and guns.  More of a guy movie overall but could be enjoyed by guys and gals. <br />Very good flick, give it a look!
0385505833|5.0|What a wonderful way to pass a few hours....with a book that has whimsical and delightful portrayals of fun and realistic characters. We can all relate to them on SOME level...and certainly find the humor in the events that occur! Quick, simple, and a lighthearted read.  I can see this as a Sunday night primetime movie! Enjoy!
B000056PWV|4.0|This is the quintessential Hitchcock flick, easy to understand, addictively interesting, featuring great stars (Grace Kelly and James Stewart), familiar bit players (Thelma Ritter in one of her best roles as Stewart's talkative nurse), and a kind of almost imperceptible satire on the human animal.  In this case, Hitchcock has glorious fun displaying a whole range of human behaviors through the device of watching them through a Greenwich Village rear window before the age of air conditioners when everyone had to leave their windows open (and some even slept on the fire escape-I've done that) to cope with the appalling heat and humidity during an eastern seaboard heatwave.<br />James Stewart stars as L.B. Jeffries, an adventurerous photographer who has a broken leg and is confined to his apartment in a cast while it heals.  Bored beyond belief, he becomes a voyeur of his neighbors.  Meanwhile there is his girlfriend, none other than Grace Kelly playing a &quot;too perfect&quot; socialite intent on winning his heart and soul.  Trouble is Jeff worries that it won't work out, that they are essentially incompatible, she a socialite, who always goes first class, he a roughing it man of the world comfortable with second class accomodations.  Naturally the audience (me!) finds it incredible that he isn't madly in love with her.<br />Raymond Burr (long TV's Perry Mason) in gray hair and specks has an interesting role as Lars Thorwald, seen almost entirely from a distance across the courtyard doing very suspicious things with knives and suitcases and mysterious comings and goings in the middle of the night.  Bored voyeurs wonder what is going on.  There is some light romantic play between Stewart and Kelly, but it is decidedly secondary to the voyeuristic adventures seen through the rear window: the saga of Miss Lonelyhearts, the ardor of the newlyweds, the angst of the songwriter, the exhibitionism of the dancing beauty, the pampered dog in a basket, and Thorwald and his invalid and then missing wife.  Hitchcock's America at midcentury.  Each of the little stories within the story has a plot and a resolution: Miss Lonelyhearts finds her man.  The songwriter finds somebody who appreciates his work.  Dancing beauty's man (looking from a distance a little like Woody Allen in an army uniform) returns.  The groom seeks a break from his exhaustive marital duties, etc.  Hitchcock's sense of satire has the softest touch, which is why, I think, he is so beloved.  In the final scene Grace Kelly, finding her man asleep, puts down the adventure book she is reading (for his benefit) and picks up Harper's Bazaar to check the fashions.  One gets the sense of future marital bliss and especially, marital reality.<br />There is some tension and some mystery, but nothing too strenuous for little old ladies from Pasadena, and nothing to offend anybody and nothing too graphic.  You can see this with the kids and your maiden aunt and all will find it interesting.  See it for Thelma Ritter, the sadonic character actress of many films, most notably this and All About Eve (1950).lid and then missing wife.  Hitchcock's America at midcentury.

6305511055|5.0|I had never heard of this film before picking it up, and now I realize I had been missing out.  Three Days of the Condor is an amazing piece of work which finds all of its participants -- Robert Redford, Faye Dunaway, Max von Sydow, director Sydney Pollack -- in top form, in a mesmerizing, briskly paced, and smart thriller that relies on tension rather than violence to do its job.<br />Redford is absolutely brilliant as lead character Turner, or Condor, a researcher who finds himself the unwilling participant of a dangerous spy game.  Redford and Pollack smartly infuse the character with both a devilish charm and occasional viciousness that makes a great contrast to the character's outward repression, and complicates his role as reluctant hero.  His dynamic with Faye Dunaway is an intriguing mix of sexual chemistry, confrontation and violation, and it makes the relationship far more interesting than most &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot; setups of this type.  Max von Sydow makes for a formidable, intelligent, and creepy opponent, and Pollack's shooting and editing are just about perfect.  Throughout the movie's substantial, sprawling plot, Pollack maintains a stifling sense of tension that engrosses you into continued attention.  True, I found myself quite lost in the maze of character relationships and motivations, but Pollack's dramatic sense is so unfailing that I never really care.<br />Nearly as good as All the President's Men as far as political thrillers go -- and that's saying a lot.
6305882592|4.0|It's curious to contemplate the value of a scenario wherein a healthy young wealthy man, the best of his life before him, can think of nothing else to do with his resources but fake his own death... in an effort, perhaps, to glean pity from others, or somehow pretend to put an end to his own existence.  I first saw this movie when I was an angst-ridden, self-absorbed teen, and I thought it was a terrific story.  About 20 years later, I happened to watch it again, and discerned what a genuine loser (throughout most of the film) Harold was.  <br />Of course, that idiot mother of his didn't help any, and it was pleasing to see Harold's antics rankle her so.<br />On another note, the actors all did a magificent job in this movie.  General Victor Ball's vehement carpet-chewing in one scene was so effective that we accidentally see actor Bud Cort unable to suppress a smile (though when the camera shifted back to his face, Harold was appropriately somber again).<br />Everyone who enjoys movies should see this movie... but be careful what values you take away from it.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris delivers a delightful array of autobiographical moments in &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;  The author not only forces the reader to laugh out loud, but beneath the mirth are serious and thoughtful moments.  The poignancy and humor are a delightful mix.<br />The first chapter sets the stage as Sedaris describes his speech therapy in a Carolina grade school.  The school is trying to correct his lisp.  In reality they are concerned about his potential homosexuality.  Sedaris has fun describing the scene.  Beneath the surface you feel his anguish.<br />The rest of the book is a colorful blur of stories about his family, early jobs and other facets of his life.  Two highlighted phases is an early addiction to speed and a later residency in Paris.  In each incident Sedaris is a clown when it comes to self-depreciation, but his smiles lightly cloaks some more serious themes.<br />I recommend &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; because of the diverse perspective it delivers.  At minimum you will be entertained.  At the same time David Sedaris introduces real social and cultural issues without sermonizing.
B00003CXV4|3.0|Okay, I don't like romances or chick flicks, and I think that this movie, except for the successful tugs on the heartstrings was poorly done.  Keanu Reeves is great in action films (i.e. The Matrix) specifically because he can't emote much.  Seeing him as a tearful, sincere lover in Sweet November was less than credible.  Charlize Theron is gorgeous as always but I don't think this movie tapped her acting talents.  Character development wasn't nearly as good as it could've been.  The movie isn't bad as a superficial movie that was good at tear-jerking antics (i.e. deathly ill woman in love with life, the puppy returned, etc.)  Jason Isaacs is always an acting treat, and the ending mildly surprised me because I thought the dialogue between Chaz and Sara was setting Sara up for a change of heart.  In spite of the flaws, this is a great sad movie if you're looking for an excuse to cry.
B00006690H|5.0|This is just an amazing album!. I have had it for over 2 months now, and I still listen to it everyday! It is definately Eminems best album ever! Here are some reviews of the songs on the cd-<BR>2: White America: A good song with a hard drum beat. Eminem really lets loose and tells his story. It definetly has more of a rock background<BR>3: Business: A great song. Extremely catchy and funny. One of my favorite songs on the album. Eminem depicts himself as a superhero trying to rescue the rap world from bad lyrics. Dr. Dre is his sidekick.<BR>4: Cleaning Out My Closet: A very angry song. Eminem really lets all his feeling out about his upbringing. If you believe what he says, this song can be very depressing.<BR>5: Square Dance: Another one of my favorite songs. Its is funny, and has a square dance like beat (hence the title). It is pretty much Eminem saying he is back and that you can relax.<BR>7: Soldier: The Kiss (track 6) is a GREAT introduction to this. Another angry song. At the end Eminem makes a statement that noone can come close to what he can do.<BR>8: Say Goodbye to Hollywood: I'm suprised this song isn't a hit. It has a catchy beat, and a nice refrain. Eminem says that hes had to much of being a rap star and needs to quit.<BR>10: Without Me: If you are looking to buy this album, you have probably heard this song. It is the first single from the album, and is EXTREMELY catchy, with no apparent topic. Eminem gos on about everything!<BR>12: Sing For the Moment: Not incredibly catchy, but Em makes a big statement. He shows his opinion on kids using guns and how (and if) he influences that. Also, he states how he feels about all his lawsuites.<BR>13: Superman: Catchy verses, bad refrain. Em talks about not needing a girlfriends to bring him down.<BR>14: Hailies Song: Most of you reading this have probably already heard this song too. It is mainly Eminem singing, and has a catchy rap lick at the end. A tribute to his daughter.<BR>16: When the Music Stops: Slightly catchy. A song with the Dirty Dozen. It is about the rappers in D12 not wanting to die alone.<BR>17: Say What You Say: A song by Eminem and Dr. Dre. Only a little bit catchy. A hard beat.<BR>18: Till I Collapse: A very catchy song with a hard clapping beat. Eminem states that he will not stop rapping until he can't rap anymore.<BR>19: My Dad's Gone Crazy: A catchy, hilarious song featuring Eminems daugter Hailie in the refrain.<BR>Well those are all the songs on the album. I strongly suggest to anyone who liked Without Me or Hailie's Song to buy this!
B00003CXAE|1.0|GREASE is the word? I don't think so! One of the most overrated (yet profitable) movie musicals ever made. The plot and script are thin, the direction is VERY bad, the characters look way too old for their parts (high schoolers?), and while some of the musical numbers and songs are memorable (SUMMER NIGHTS & GREASE LIGHTNING), they too are terribly directed. Notice the singing of the characters in the film are all out of synch when anyone is performing. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John play the leads of two love struck high schoolers (Danny and Sandy) who have previously met at the beach during summer vacation. They fall in love, but when summer ends they part ways thinking they'll meet intermittantly because Sandy is vacationing from Austraila. However, when school begins, she unexpectedly stays in the states and begins school where Danny goes. When they meet again Danny can't show his true feelings to her. Also, he takes on his alter ego, opposite of the romantic beach boy, because he is part of a greaser gang (The T-Birds). It wouldn't be \\"Cool\\" to be love with a \\"Sandra Dee\\" type... that is, a girl who doesn't \\"put out\\". (The guys think they are a bunch of toughs, but in reality are a bunch of wimps in disguise i.e. Micheal Tucci as Sonny.) Then there is the Pink Ladies, the mirrored opposite sex equivalent of the \\"T-Birds\\" who are equally puzzling because you have two cool chicks (Stockard Channing as Rizzo and Dinah Manoff as Marty) and the rest seemingly act like Sandy (most notable.. Didi Conn as Frenchie). The rest of the story deals with Danny trying to win back Sandy when he realises he wants to be with her despite of what the other greasers think and still maintain his tough greaser image.  So, he tries out for different sports to be a jock to impress her etc...Also, here are minor subplots such as the T-Birds competing against another gang (or car club). The film scores only because of the supporting cast and cameos with the likes of the late Eve Arden as Principal McGee, Sid Ceasar as Coach Calhoun, Alice Ghostly, Frankie Avalon, Sha Na Na, Ed Byrnes, and the late Joan Blondell. Movie gets worse with each subsequent screenings because the main characters are all mean spirited and annoying (especially Jeff Conaway as Kenickie). Note: look for Michael Biehn (TERMINATOR, TOMBSTONE) as one of Lorenzo Lamas' (Tom the Jock) athletic buddies.den as Principal McGee, Sid Ceasar as Coach Calhoun, Alice Ghostly, Frankie Avalon, Sha Na Na, Ed Byrnes, and the late Joan Blondell.

B000059XUO|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 16 and just loved it.  It was so dark and edgy.  Why don't they make movies like this anymore?  I loved Brandon Lee's martial arts action, but also his human emotions as Eric Draven.  I could really feel Draven's pain at his horrible losses.<br />The DVD gives me DTS 5.1 which I adore.  The picture was very good and dark.<br />Just one note, it's not set in Detroit.  It's set in Los Angeles.
0316666343|5.0|14 year old Susie Salmon is raped and murdered by a neighbor.  She tells her story from heaven as Susie watches over her family, her friends and her killer.<br />We really begin to understand the grief and loss for each member of the Salmon household.  Some of their lives unravel.  Some build strength from their sorrow.  All eventually find acceptance -- including Susie.<br />Author Alice Sebold is a beautiful writer.  Susie finds that heaven is individually designed.  Sebold demonstrates a creative gift that easily rivals J. K. Rowling in describing Susie's imaginative heavenly wishes. The dilemna for the young girl is the limits of a 14 year old imagination.  She must explore and observe the earth to broaden her heaven.  The story underlines the beauty of the search over the destination.<br />'Lovely Bones' projects many levels -- a mystery/thriller, a romance, and a moving story about courageous relationships.  The characters are clear and memorable.<br />In a year of excellent books 'Lovely Bones' stands out.  Many are calling it a classic.  Perhaps, but for me it is a personal treasure -- a peace of heaven in the literary clouds.
B000022TSW|5.0|This movie encompasses all that we enjoy in a modern day commedy. From the sick jokes, to the painful irony, to the mirror image of society, SP:BLU had me falling out of my seat more than once. When I left the theater, my eyes were red and swollen and my chest hurt. I had never laughed that hard for that long in my life. I can still remember the audience giving a standing ovation for the execution of Bill Gates...<br />Parker and Stone managed to not only to match the quality of their TV series, but surpass it brilliantly. This movie mercilessly bashes censorship and hypocrisy through the eyes of simple, innocent children. It's a perspective that nearly everyone loses in time.  This movie should be seen by EVERYONE.

Not as funny as Vineland.  Not as deep or dark as V.
0142000663|5.0|I read this tragic story with a constant smile on my face.  The characters are so completely enjoyable.  The situations heart rending yet so vividly described that it is entertaining/amusing.<br />The story is not so much amusing because it is humorous.  The smile is pure amazement over Steinbeck's ability to create this work where I could be a first hand witness to the characters and events.  Some situations are laugh-out-loud funny although serious.  Even the tragic events bring a smile and a lump to your throat at the same time.  Every page pulled at my heart, my mind, and my face.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br />It is also a real eye opener to the industrial revolution, big finance, and the depression era.<br />As another reviewer wrote 'This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man.'
B000063UR2|4.0|I loved the visuals and the DTS sound the movie was encoded with.  However I found some of it hard to understand.  Who was the old lady who was talking to the princess at the beginning of the movie?  If she's a princess, why is she out gallavanting around by herself w/o bodyguards?  Who was that one gnome who actually turned out to be good, and did he die at the end?  Also, how did the dead unicorn stallion come back to life at the end?  Other than that, it was great.
B00006950W|4.0|From all the bad hype this movie received I thought it would be a stinker.Was I wrong.I found it to be exiting from start to finish.I took away 1 star for the so-so beginning.It has a good story line based on the capcom game.The director managed to keep excessive gore in check yet still produce a shocking movie.I would reccommend it to either a action or horror buff.
B000002MFE|2.0|This is one of those recording where if you are a fan of the artist, you will love it, but if you are not, you won't.  For me,  Layla and Tears in Heaven were the tracks that I liked, but the covers of acoustic blues standards sounded tired and uninspired like he had played them too many times.  If you are not a big Clapton fan, best listen to the original blues men do these.

B00005JKCH|3.0|Spiderman! who doesnt know him...This Spring awaken from the comics to rule the movie screens. But unfortunatly the \\"resurrection\\" couldnt keep up to the comics, not only due to the wretched acting talents of the characters but also because Hollywood had to streghten up the trashy teen romance between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and his sweetheart next-door (Kirsten Dunst) to the max.<BR>But if you are a fan of mind warping, astonishing visual effects and Hollywood's storytelling-exaggerations dont bother you, this movie will bound you for almost 2 hours in your seat!
6300246787|4.0|Someone a few reviews down called it one of the happiest musical productions, and that's what does it for me!! For those of you looking for more anti-Barbra ammunition (too young for the role, too self-absorbed, etc.), consider that this was only her SECOND ever film and the one production she's shared with an extremely large cast. (And I personally don't hold Ms. Streisand's politics against her, even if so many, many, MANY others do.) The film is also one of the truest examples of a lavish movie musical, and it soars *because* of its fibre-optic thin plot of likable New Yorkers being romantically matched all over Yonkers just before the turn of the century. There are musical soliloquies from everyone-- from Streisand, Walter Matthau, clerks Michael Crawford and Danny Locklin, to hat mistress Marianne McAndrew, and dance turns with Locklin, E. J. Peaker, and the ridiculously gangly Tommy Tune. There's something for everyone in this very sweet, comic, tuneful film-- even jazz great Louis Armstrong!! Streisand is quite good as a 19th-century yenta, and even shows pathos in the film's softer moments like the \\"Parade\\" number (quietly speaking to the locket pic of her deceased), and my personal favorite, \\"Love Is Only Love-\\" staged through a bedroom window, showing Ms. Streisand unusually vulnerable, hair down and in a dressing gown- but incredibly beautiful. Thank God it's on DVD, in all of its Todd-AO, widescreen glory.
0226443213|5.0|Do you remember the heat wave in Chicago in 1995? The rail lines folded, electricity went out with rolling blackouts, some streets even buckled. The heat was over 100 degrees, rarely dipping below the 80's at night, and the humidity near 100%. But what most people don't remember is the horrific human death toll during that time. Over 700 people were killed in that heat wave that lasted nearly a week. But while the author looks deeply into the horror of this natural disaster, he mainly concentrates with precision on a few separate areas:<br />First, that heat waves kill more people annualy than all other types of natural disasters combined. Yet they receive little public attention mostly because they fail to generate the massive property damage and fantastic images produced by other weather-related disasters.<br />Second, most of the people that died were the elderly and poor, who died at home, with their windows often sealed or even nailed shut to prevent rampant crime in their areas. They had no air conditioning because they could not afford it, and little or any access to any social help because of their economic situation.<br />The author also looks into how the city of Chicago didn't come to grips with what had happened until the heat wave was well over, and that because of the social structure where the affluent have ample protection from such massive natural disasters, the elderly, infirm and poor will likely remain having none. And while dealing with the aftermath is much more costly, governments choose not to prepare for them with social programs which are often  viewed as liberal pork or government waste.<br />A fascinating, well written book. It also contains many images, some of which appear is if taken from somewhere like Somalia. Eric Klinenberg is an sociology professor at Northwestern University.

6305280762|5.0|This movie deserved the three Academy Awards that it won back in 1974, especially the Best Special Effects award - the fires were one of the key elements that made THE TOWERING INFERNO into what I think is the best disaster movie ever made. <BR>     A dedication ceremony is being held at the Glass Tower, a newly finished building that stretches a hundred and thirty-five floors upward, with a lot of important people (the mayor, his wife, the senator, his wife, etc.). However, despite the building's architect's warnings, a night of celebration turns into a fiery nightmare when a fire caused by &quot;fluky wiring&quot; breaks out and begins spreading rapidly up through the floors, towards where the celebration is being held.<BR>    In every disaster movie that I've seen, there are always the same types of characters. There's the hero who predicts what's going to happen, but nobody listens to him (architect Doug Roberts -  Paul Newman), the hero's beautiful girlfriend<BR>(Susan - Faye Dunaway), the hardcore veteran of past bad happenings (Chief O'Hallorhan - Steve McQueen), a guy who ignores what the hero says for his own benefit (Jim Duncan - I can't remember who the heck plays him), a guy who's the bad guy of the movie right along with whatever nature is dishing out (Richard Chamberlain, who played an excellant bad guy - I was so glad when he got his near the end), and thousands of desperate people.<BR>     In spite of these similiarities to other disaster movies, THE TOWERING INFERNO does a good job of giving the audience a look at the relationships of different people and how their lives <BR>intersect with others' as the disaster takes place. If you're a fan of disaster movies, this is the movie to have in your VHS or DVD collection.
0553277472|4.0|ZATAOMM is a philosophical train of thought to question the meaning behind the meaning. 'Quality' is the term that Robert Pirsig uses to explain the unexplainable. If the previous sentence sounds too philosophical then skip this book. 'Zen and the Art' is a brilliant explanation not only about the source of happiness, but also about the source of the thought where happiness was formed.<br />It gives me encouragement to realise that sitting in a classroom with teachers whose purpose is to indoctrinate not to teach and learn together may not be the ideal growth experience.<br />I completed my reading of the book last night and many of the ideas, morals and guidance are yet to sink in.<br />ZATAOMM is a classic and beautiful narration for the philosophically minded.

B0000683DH|5.0|True Trekkers know that Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, is the best Star Trek film ever made. A sci-fi take on &quot;A Tale of Two Cities,&quot; it has meanings on multiple levels. <BR>And after years of waiting, a director's cut that does the film justice. This two-disc set is packed with great features including a documentary about the film's special effects. The FX may seem seem outdated, but, in fact, they marked a milestone in filmmaking. Star Trek II featured the first 3-D computer graphic imagery (CGI) ever used in a motion picture to create ts &quot;Genesis Effect&quot;. video scene. Best of all, the widescreen movie features numerous scenes that were cut (why?) from the home video and original DVD release. The last time many of these scenes have been seen was when the film aired on television about 12 years ago. Among the new storylines re-inserted are the dialogue introducing Scotty's nephew. The added scenes aren't much, maybe only 3 minutes of footage total. But they add so much to the story, the film becomes even more emotional.  <BR>The sound quality on the director's cut DVD is also bar none. For true Star Trek fans, or sci fans in general, this is a must-have DVD!

Listen to it once and you'll be hooked.
B00005JKJA|3.0|David Lynch leads the viewer into a film noir reminiscent of nothing I've ever seen. I can't decide if I liked or disliked this movie. It starts out with a stirring storyline as we meet a beautiful woman who has lost her identity after a freak accident. Along comes Betty who has just arrived in Hollywood on a bus from Ontario. The girls become fast friends, and Betty who comes upon our needy beauty, who has decided to call herself Rita for the time being, is bound and determined to help her find her identity.<br />Lynch throws in scenes that are there just to make you think and if you are trying to figure out the second part of this film just forget it and go with the flow because once Pandora's box is opened life will never be the same for any of our characters. Names change, characters do about faces, and the roller coaster ride begins as you try to piece it all together.<br />Lynch seems to enjoy leading the viewer on a merry chase to no place, and if you think you will ever get there, think again because you won't. Take away what you like; it is up for grabs. This is a movie for the person who thinks outside of the box and the answers are unique to each person who sits down to watch it. At one point I felt like I was waiting to see a car crash and I couldn't turn away, the disappointment was that nothing ever came of it.  Kelsana  8/15/02
0345413377|5.0|When I first picked up _The Golden Compass_, I was 12 and had heard that it was fantastic. After 100 pages I put it on the shelf, where it remained for the next two years.<br />Last month I picked it up again and breezed through it in a day, wondering how I could have ever deemed such a complex and magnificent novel \\"boring\\". I quickly moved on to _The Subtle Knife_, which I loved just as much. I fell in love with the characters, who were wonderfully three-dimensional, and Pullman's prose, which is lyrical, light, and even heartbreaking at times.<br />I was afraid to read _The Amber Spyglass_, for fear that Pullman wouldn't live up to the immense task he had created with the first two books. But my fears turned out to be completely dissolved as soon as I read the first chapter.<br />From there, I was hooked, unable to put it down and reading hundreds of pages in one night. The book is full of fantastical elements -- angels, witches, armored bears, and even a wheel-riding species called the mulefa -- but what makes it such an amazing work is its ability to be *human*. The protagonists, Lyra Silvertongue and Will Parry, have faults, talents, emotions, fears, and everything else that comes along with being human. When reading the book, I felt like I was right there, that the two were my closest friends. When they were hurt, so was I. When they were happy, I was thrilled.<br />_The Amber Spyglass_ is a 500 page novel, but once you've finished it, you'll wish it were longer. The ending was absolutely tragic; it left me in tears and unable to sleep or to stop thinking about it for days afterward.<br />For those who argue the book is sacrilegious...well. If you're not able to live with new ideas, why are you reading in the first place? To quote Philip Pullman:<br />\\"Horrible reviews on [websites]? Really? Good thing I don't read them then. Actually if people think that books are only for those who already agree with them, then they don't deserve books.\\"<br />Bravo, Philip.<br />If Mr Pullman ever chooses to continue in this universe, I'll be first in line to buy the books -- they are full of heart, humor, and characters you will adore...they are easily the best books I have ever read, and I would recommend them to anyone. The Harry Potter series doesn't even compare to this one, nor do the Chronicles of Narnia. And even if fantasy isn't your thing, do not be afraid to read this trilogy. It will leave you breathless and wanting more.
B00005QXDD|2.0|I first became aware of Tenacious D through their performances on Saturday Night Live.  Jack Black and his bro'  Kyle Gass performed acoustic satire of heavy metal ostentation- including a sweaty Meat-Loaf-ian rewrite of the Birthday Song replete with gothic chorous, dry ice, and wide-eyed screaming emotion.  It was a hoot! <br /> Later that month, I saw Tenacious D live, just Kyle, Jack, two acoustic guitars and a couple of &quot;Stomp Rockets&quot; in place of  such stage pyrotechnics.  With nothing more than this bare bones arrangement, &quot;The D&quot; conjured up the spirts of Meat Loaf, Ronnie James Dio, Led Zeppelin, and others from the bombastic legions of metaldom.  I realized that Black and Gass are extremely talented musicians with a knack for distlling the essense the many sub-genres of hard rock: the anthem, the gothic ballad, the policically &quot;serious&quot; anti-war epic and many others, the existence of which hadn't really occured to me.  Black, especially, has a powerful voice, and an intensity that fills even an empty stage.   The satire, too, was biting and hilarious and often delightfully crude.<br />So, when I bought this first release of the band, I was disappointed to learn that Tenacious D had chosen to record themselves not as an acoustic Duo, but as a sort of standard heavy metal act.  Conjuring up Iron Maiden with a full metal band behind you is not nearly as entertaining as doing so with a couple of acoustic guitars- especially if the metal band is recorded as flatly as this one is.  The musicians sound like hired studio hacks playing listlessly over in another room.  The  songs, frankly, don't rock nearly as hard as they do in their live versions.  <br />The &quot;in between&quot; parts of this record consist of hilariously crude schtick between the two of them, with Gass playing the innocent put-upon, and Black the intense misunderstood &quot;artist&quot;.    Here, sensitive parents should note, the versatile &quot;F word&quot; is morphed into every possible form of speech, noun, verb, interjection, adjective, adverb, preposition...<br />As such, this CD works better as a comedy than a music recording.    But comedy recordings usually only old up to a few listenings before being relegated to the never again played part of the collection shelf.    <br />In other words, if you're like me, you'll laugh a few times at &quot;Cock Pushups&quot; or &quot;Lee&quot; or &quot;F**K Her Gently&quot; (the best song on the CD), but, with familliarity, the joke will soon wear thin.

There's enough espionage-counter-espionage here to please LeCarre us fans, but this really is not a spy story in the true sense of that genre.<br />This is a literary masterpiece.  I first read it when it came out and just finished reading it again (though re-reading a story is rare for me) and appreciate it even more this time.

B000000OYN|5.0|The Whitesnake of old (pre 1987 smash self-titled album) was the real Whitesnake. Influenced by both Coverdale's old band Deep Purple, and by Bad Company, the import albums from the late 70's and early 80's are great. This is one of the classic LPs Coverdale and crew released. The price is excellent. The disc is great because it is made by Geffen (which is manufactured by Warner Brothers), so you know your getting a quality disc. This album features John Lord on organ/keyboards. Look for 1980's &quot;Ready and Willing&quot; for Whitesnake's best line-up (John Lord and Ian Paice on drums). A classic....for a classic price!
0316666343|5.0|This book is beautiful. So many passages are filled with longing for home and family.

She also has friends in heaven, although they are limited consolation, since they are other people who have also been killed, and they are not her own family.

B000000OMP|5.0|Coverdale had earned his stripes in Deep Purple's last few lineups. He put together his own band after a couple of solo discs. Whitesnake was an updated version of the old Deep Purple engine. They released a series of decent albums in the late 70's and early 80's. This, in 1984, was their best LP of their career. The '87 album was good, but mostly a rehash of old songs. This has bluesy metal,soulful ballads,and fierce rocking anthems. All the highs and lows of a heavy metal classic. John Lord on keyboards is a nice extra. He dosent get room to solo like he did in Purple though. Powell on drums is fair. I feel Ian Paice would have been a better choice. John Sykes is an underated guitarist. Coverdale has strong skills in songwriting, and he uses his voice as an instrument, and not just a way to scream the lyrics over the music. Martin Birch's production ties everything down and makes this an over the top classic. This is even better then Rainbow. Sadly, Coverdale would disband this lineup and go on a three year hiatus. When he returned in '87, Whitesnake was just another Hair metal group. This classic was the only album that has the legs to stand in comparison to the Deep Purple reunion album &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;, which was released the same year(John Lord would leave Whitesnake to re-form Deep Purple's MK II lineup). Enjoy this classic!
6302859204|3.0|Fire in the Sky is striking for it's statement: superior intelligent &quot;entities&quot; (wether they come from outer space or from another reality) are not necessarily benevolent...nor bad...or good, they might simply consider us as lab rats. It is with detachment and indifference that they examine their catches. We are abducted, restrained, examined, tagged, preserved, killed or simply released in our &quot;safe&quot; reality, depending on what they feel might be useful for them. Like catching a fish, just for the pleasure of it, and then trowing the fish back in the water. Do we feel guilty in doing this ?  It is very interesting to note that these aliens are quite similar to us: same anthropomorphic appearence and same cruelty. They might in fact be a miror image of us.  A manifestation of our deep subconscious nightmares, alternate life options born from the same collective unconscious. These events revive the old debate about what is Reality. A movie, wether based or not on a &quot;true&quot; story, you will not forget that easily. Not for children and sensible persons.
B000068PQ7|5.0|Georgeous remastering of the spare but evocative sound of this artist at his most Dylanesque- not surprising that Bob himself once said that he wish he had written one of its songs,&quot;Spanish Guitar&quot;.<br />Some believe this album was a bit too dark or austere- for me it's just a great collection of songs by this terrific (but commercially unrewarded) singer/songwriter that stands along side the rest of his best solo work- NO OTHER, FANTASTIC EXPEDITION OF DILLARD &amp; CLARK and ROADMASTER.
B000068TPN|1.0|I would have never thought that I'd one day laugh hysterically at a war-genre movie. Then I saw &quot;We Were Soldiers.&quot; With all honesty, this could have passed for a comedy in my mind. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is one of the most ridiculous war movies I've seen in recent years, with a story that is embarrasingly hysterical. Mel Gibson did his best to try and save the film, but it ended up sinking faster than the Titanic. The films weakest point was the story of Gibson's wife, Julie Moore (Madeleine Stowe;) it's where the film gets the most laughs, for me at least. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; is easily one of the worst films of 2002, and will most likely remain on my list of the Worst Films of the Year permenantly. What a horrible movie.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I continue to be amazed at the criticism this music release receives.  No, it's not Play.  It is different than Play, but it is just as good.  I enjoy the various artists that make up the CD and it's refreshing to have some exposure to some non-mainstream music.  I have since purchased an Azure Ray CD due to the song 'Great Escape'...the music and vocals are beautiful.  So, from a fan who is glad this not another Play (what would be the point?), this CD is worth the cash.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Not really bluegrass as it has often been called, the music on the &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot; soundtrack actually predates bluegrass by roughly 10-15 years.  Indeed, most of it is actually the music from which much of bluegrass originated.  In fact, there is really only one song here, the wonderful closing number from the Stanley Brothers called &quot;Angel Band&quot; that really comes class to being actual bluegrass.<br />But why bother with labels?  This is monumental stuff and worth hearing whether you saw the movie and loved it, saw the movies and disliked it, or have never even seen the movie.  At a time when Nashville (and country radio in particular) has sold its soul to this highest bidder this album represents a genuine spirit that is rising again.  This is the real deal.

Spirited by the horrific events of 9/11, the Boss and his bandmates deliver a musically uplifting and spiritual take on events that shaped our futures forever.  Springsteen's music on &quot;The Rising&quot; never wavers from it's ultimate message that by digging deeply within the soul one can manage to find the courage and the wisdom to move in a positive direction and stare down those who intend to bring our society to it's knees.  From the opening track &quot;Lonesome Day&quot;, and concluding with the opus, &quot;My City In Ruins&quot;, Springsteen and the E Street Band score a five star masterpiece, perhaps their finest musical achievement ever recorded.
0880389052|2.0|I have not read as much fantasy as some, but have read enough to know what is good in the genre and what isn't.  Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy, while certainly not as bad as some of the fantasy titles I've read, does not come close to some of the greats of the genre: Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and HickmanWeiss' Dragonlance Chronicles, for example.  Salvatore's writing is rather simplistic, both in language and in plot.  I pretty much knew what was going to happen next.  The characters for the most part lack enough complexity and nuances in personality to make them truly interesting, and the plot isn't good or strong enough to carry the book.  Drizzt is a good dark elf trapped in a world of evil, and it becomes very clear that he doesn't fit and therefore must leave.  The rest of the characters are all truly evil, with the exception of his father, who is torn.  It's just not that interesting.  For a truly complex world with complex characters, I recommend the Dragonlance Chronicles by Hickman and Weiss--the best fantasy story out there.
B00006690G|5.0|I'm not a big fan of hip hop or rap (BTW, is there a difference between the two?).  My daughter introduced me to Eminem's music. She' 13, and we have really different taste in music.  Eminem was just another Vanilla Ice, I guess I thought if I thought about him at all.  Then, I saw the Grammy show which paired Slim and Elton John, and I was just blown away.  Wow, what a clever song this is.  And, I didn't see what the hullabaloo about this guy was.<BR>A long while later, my daughter picks up the latest CD, The Eminem Show.  I heard \\"My Dad's gone Crazy\\".  I thought the kid sounded so cute.  And the line where Em sings, \\"It's like my mother always told me nanananananana\\".  I laughed out loud.  That's exactly what we parents sound like when we're lecturing our kids.  That's what they hear!  And then, I couldn't get Halie's part out of my mind.  \\"I think my dad's gone crazy\\"... Loved it.<BR>The next invasion to rent space in my head was Cleaning out my closet.  I was struck by the contrast between the verses and the chorus.  Em's pretty hurt from his mom, I thought.  And then the chorus, \\"I'm sorry Mama\\".  I don't know what Marshall was intending but it struck me that this song is deeply ambivalent and the contrast between the verses and the choruses demonstrate this ambivalence quite dramatically.  He loves his mother, but he's angry and hurt from stuff in their past.  The video is similarly moving.<BR>I started telling people they had to hear Eminem's stuff (as though I'd discovered him!   though, in my demographic, he's not as appreciated as he is with the teens.  In my opinion, and I normally only listen to accoustic music, he's a BRILLIANT writer/poet, and his music is so insanely catchy, *that* should carry the warning label.  Warning:  After hearing one time, prepare to allow these songs to pop up in your head.  <BR>It was only later that I saw the words to some of his earlier stuff.  I don't like the song where he's imagining Kim in the trunk.  part... but theway he directs the song to Halie feels squicky.  I mean, I believe him when he says he doesn't let her listen to his music, but at some point, she's going to hear that song and Kim *is* her mother.  <BR>White America is a funny tune, full of boast and bluster.  Eminem thinks he's so cute.  Well, apparently the teen girls do too.  I think he's funny and very, very clever.  But, not exactly someone who seems to have much rapport with women.<br />Poor Eminem.  He cant' seem to catch a break, unless you count being a HUGE SUPERSTAR \\"catching a break\\". <BR>Square dance demanded equal time and for a few days, it was all about \\"Do see do now... \\" over and over in my head.  That song strikes me as musically and lyrically being so unsophisticated, and it's and intentional effect and quite effective.  As he sings the goofy, by infectious, \\"So come on down.. \\" he's talking about some serious [stuff], like war and drafting boys at 18 and again, with the \\"Don't be scared now, there ain't nothin' to worry about.\\" the counterpoint is clear.  Listen up kids, and think.  <BR>Drips is too crude and lude for my taste.  ...  Maybe, I'm missing the point on that one.  <BR>Saying Goodbye to Hollywood seemed like a farewell song to my daughter who worries that this is our Emmy's last album.  \\"Come on, get real, honey.  What's he gonna do if he turns his back on the fame and fortune?  Flip burgers?  Not likely.<BR>The rest of the CD is very listenable... very good.  His sweet sensitive side is the most appealing one he has.  He should let people see that and leave the crude shock stuff for lesser artists. <BR>He's no Ice Tea... He's the real java!
630471193X|4.0|Phenomenon is a touching film which will reward the viewer with some real tears. It plays on the concept of &quot;connection&quot; on many levels - from partnerships lost (Kyra Sedgwick perfect as a woman who has left the city after being left herself), to the connections that are born between mother and child, connections between the subatomic particles that make up all life, sunlight and growth, and many more lesser examples - even some tragic ones. This is a message film, but the message is a good one.<br />Though not quite as artistic as, say, a Bill Forsyth (Local Here, Housekeeping, etc.) film - this is aimed at a more commercial audience, and has the soundtrack to prove it - but Forsyth would appreciate how the writer and director of Phenomenon are most interested in showing how a person can too easily become an outsider even in a small town. That, and the romantic element of the story is the meat of the film. Unlike many commercial films, all the characters appear well thought-out -- even the FBI agent who has perhaps three minutes of screen time delivers the humanity of the role. And I must mention there is another wonderful cameo by Brent Spiner, as good as his cameo in ID4.<br />It is sad that the original DVD edition does not have any of the extra scenes that were added to the NBC television screening of the film (including the scene from which the cover art was derived!). I don't think a film like this needs a commentary track - it is a fable about human potential, after all, and as a fable it speaks clearly on its own - but extra scenes would have been welcomed. The soundtrack also needs to be remastered to be more spacious. Absolutely worth getting now, but twice as reccomended if Buena Vista comes out with the Special Edition this film deserves.
B000001FE0|4.0|Considered the Bee Gees most Psychedelic album, it also often condsidered one of their best. I honestly don't see why. There are some memorable tracks, but I usually find myself skipping through most of them. In all their years of writing and releasing material, the Bee Gees know how to make a good album. \\"Odessa\\", however, proves to be a mistake that was learned from. The Brothers themselves have said that the album should have never been made. As the last album that they released before the highly publicized break-up, \\"Odessa\\" is missing something. It's hard to pinpoint what that missing element is, but I don't think that the Brothers put their all into making this album. Among a collection of mostly mediocre tracks lie a few gems, such as, \\"Marly Purt Drive\\", \\"Melody Fair\\", \\"Suddenly\\", \\"Lamplight\\" and \\"Give Your Best\\". I wouldn't recommend this album to a new Bee Gees fan, being that it's not by any stretch their best work, but any die-hard fan, like myself, can appreciate something off of this CD...

B000006TRV|5.0|What a mind trip. I've been listening to this since I was a kid. Everybody should check it out!
B00000DFRS|5.0|i havealways loved whitney, as i see her as one of those gem female master singers.but i never expected an album AS UTTERLY AMAZING AS THIS!! each and every song is equally mind-blowing, and i reccomend this album to absolutely anyone and everyone who likes great music.
B00004Y6NV|4.0|Those who think of this album as an aberration because they know only Brothers in Arms do not really understand Mark Knopfler. BIA itself had a dark, pessimist edge (The man's too strong, the title track) besides the pop hits.<BR>On Every Street has a similar structure with possibly more irony in its lyrics, though having been released in the '90s faced less attention for its hits than BIA.<BR>If you know and appreciate Communique or Love Over Gold you will love the album, in particular Iron Hand and Planet of NO. A late night album for a decade of pessimism.
B000007OY0|5.0|This movie is, not to sound like a cliche, one of the best I've ever seen. It has a messege(unlike a lot of movies), and it is delivered beautifully. Don't hesitate to see this movie if you haven't--you'll only be hurting yourself.:)
0446608955|4.0|I saw the movie (adaptation) of &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; and really liked it, a very simple, down-to-earth, heartwarming, heartbreaking movie, a story that makes you want to be a better person, and be a small role in this bigger part of the world.<br />I was told the book was more interesting and it definitely IS! A lot, and I mean a lot of details were taken out of the movie context, and at times the &quot;space and time&quot; settings were not clear, after reading the book only did I understood what was really meant about &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;. The movie has done the book, the story injustice.<br />If you are feeling really down and out, try reading this book, it would make you feel better, that there is the thing call 'Love' in this world, in many forms than you can think of.

0316666343|5.0|I was a little put off in the beginning due to the subject of a child being murdered, but I'm glad I kept reading.  Sebold has a delightful style and creates rich characters.
B000066NW0|5.0|Brilliant album!!! One of the best of 2002 by now definitely!!! The first time I heard \\"Complicated\\", I thought it was an average pop-rock song but now I think it's the best song released this year so far!!! The album has got many different flavours, but all songs are verrryyyy catchy, yet not cheesy, and one can sing with them after playing them for 2/3 times!!! I love the direction Avril took in what concerns the music genre... She took a bit of Alanis, Jewel, and a bit of Pink and adding her punkish attitude she created 13 wonderful songs!!!<br />Losing Grip 9.5/10 - Brilliant album opener... This song totally roxxx hard!!!<br />Complicated 10/10 - Masterpiece!!! What more can I say!!! <br />Sk8er Boi 10/10 - Her next single... Wonderful guitar riffs... Surely it's gonna be the next pop-punk anthem!!!<br />I'm With You 8/10 - One of my least favourite songs on this CD... Avril shows she's got a brilliant voice in this number but it's a bit slow for my tastes...<br />Mobile 9/10 - Very catchy song but not a highlight for me!<br />Unwanted 10/10 - This is a rocker!!! This sounds a bit like Alanis' \\"Head Over Feet\\" and thats very cooool considering that Alanis is my fave singer!!!<br />Tomorrow 8.5/10 - The least catchy song of the album... But it's growing on me right now... A bit slow but it's a wonderful song!<br />Anything But Ordinary 7/10 - I gave it 7 because I love it's lyrics but musically it's a bit too poppy for my tastes... My least fave overall.<br />Things I'll Never Say 10/10 - Wooow... Amazing song... This can make for another single for Avril in my opinion... This song totally haunted me... it's got wonderful guitar riffs and Avril's voice is brilliant as always!!!<br />My World 10/10 - Masterpiece!!! This is going to be a smash-hit if it gets released as a single!!! Brilliant!!!<br />Nobody's Fool 9.5/10 - Lovely lyrics!!! And Avril shows she's good at rap as well... & she shows she's a very confident girl when she sings \\"I've got a backbone stronger than yours\\"... Great song!!!<br />Too Much To Ask 9/10 - This is a very heart-felt song!!! Not a highlight but it's very good!!! <br />Naked 7.5/10 - This song is okay but it suffers because it's not that much power-pop like.<br />All in all, I think Avril has got a great future in the music scene... Very very promising rocker as well... \\"Complicated\\" is doing great chartwise and I'm sure that \\"My World\\", \\"Things I'll Never Say\\", \\"Unwanted\\" and the next single \\"Sk8er Boi\\" can be nearly as huge and are going to keep Avril around until she comes up with more new stuff!!! I think in the future her songs might verge to a more alternative-punk sound... With her debut album selling over a million copies in just 6 weeks, she's already got a very strong fan base and she'd surely won't go away easily... Rock On Avril babe!!!!
B00005J6T0|5.0|Of The Madonna Albums I Own and I Have purchased or listened to. This ranked at Madonnas third best effort. Erotica is # 1 and Bedtime Stories # 2. But this album is also very good. It has good dance tracks, it has a great ballad. The music is good. Catchy and overall it is a great album. it includes some of her famous songs ( Papa Dont Preach the LPs biggest track). Open your Heart, Live To Tell and the incredible La Isla Bonita and also the title track which is probably my least favourite song on the Album. but it is good. I am though amazed it is a bit overlooked in madonnas cataloug if you look at it nowadays. Which is pretty strange cause it is not only one of her best albums but it is also her biggest selling Album. If You see this in stores buy it.

6301954947|5.0|When this movie was released in 1970 it was said to have contained a lot more footage. I have heard rumors that a 3 hr version exists somewhere. This would make more sense as the scenes with the Prussians appear disjointed, and even the Quarte Bras scene seems out of context. The movie had to be reduced in length for cinema release, but the result has provided only an inperfect picture of the Waterloo drama and all its complexities. A DVD release would hopefully correct some of this problem by allowing more footage, perhaps cleaning up the film itself, and add some much needed background information and production notes. It would be interesting to see where the film was shot, what army was used for extras, and also what Rod Steiger and Chrisopher Plummer thought of their roles in the film. All of this would add greatly to what is already an epic work.<br /><br />Not-withstanding these short-comings, what we have is still an impressive work. Few period movies have gone to such lengths to provide accuracy. The uniforms are all correct, although the British are shown as the main elements in Wellington's army. It would have been nice to see a bit more blue and green coats in the shots of Wellington's troops on the ridge as this would have shown the significant Dutch-Belgian contingents that made up his army as well.<br /><br />The casting of Plummer and Stieger also was good. Stieger supposedly said this was one of his favorite roles. Some have critisized his performance of Napolean in the movie, but Stieger seems content to have portrayed a Napolean unsure of himself and in earnest. This is not an unreasonable portrayal to make, and if the viewer can divorce the actor from the historical personage some sense can be made here. This was Napolean's last campaign, and no doubt he felt some uncertainty when he embarked upon it, as the odds were heavily against him. His health was also not what it use to be.<br /><br />Christopher's Plummer's Wellington is supurb. Here critics can find little that is wrong. He has the Iron Duke's personality down perfectly. The acid wit and cool detached demeanor concealing a real concern for the state of his army and the position it is in to face the great Napolean.  Plummer uses Wellington quotes from all over the place, many from while the Duke was in Spain, and not from Waterloo, but it still works anyway.<br /><br />Viwers who are not familer with the history may find it difficult to follow the movie, especially since the editing makes it even more confusing at times. Without some historical background the movie may just come across as a series of massive, confused battle scenes, which does injustice to the epic events which it is attempting to show. I would recommend reading any books on the Waterloo campaign in order to get the most out of it. For sheer scope and size, few movies can compare, and the viewer is in for a feast of the eye with this one. With those massive battle scenes the viewer should consider also that these were real extras, not computer CGI images! For a period war movie this is the best, for all its faults.  Waterloo cries out for a DVD director's edition.  Let's hope it happens some day.<br /><br />PS - There is a recent Chinese-English version out on DVD.  This version runs about the same amount of time but includes a few extra minutes of battle scenes.  A few scenes at Hougamont, and some also with Napolean marching with the Guard before the final assault, as well as when the Guard breaks and panic ensues. The credits also list teh Soviet Army as well as the 1st battalion, The Gordon Highlanders.  Their Drums and Pipes and regimental dancers are featured in the film.  Its not much, and there are no extra features, but those who want a Region 1 edition of the DVD might want to consider it.  Its unfortunate that the Chinese should produce something like this instead of the studio itself!  Will still need a collectors edition.t is wrong. He has the Iron Duke's personality down perfectly.

6304508611|3.0|This could be a  masterpiece really. From the opening and most of its running time, this movie shines with stella performance by actresses/actor. Especially two leading actress (Daughter and Mama surely) have done fantastic gobs.  I consider this as a sad life story of a girl rather than horror movie. I enjoyed it but as it comes to the ending, it's ruined quickly. She harms 'everyone' so that finally she proved she was a creepy monster indeed? There were some good peoples around her at least.<br />BTW, there were some flaws. If you put blood somewhere overnight, you will have a loaf of coagulated blood rather than 'liquid'. <br />But overall, this movie is worth watching due to the fantastic performances. The voice of Piper Laurie is...wow!
B00001IVOR|5.0|First off, I must say that I was never a fan of rap and hip hop and still am not.  I'm just a white, middle class, suburbinite.  I must also add that I have deep respect for extremely talented expressions of artwork.  That is where Wu-Tang's Forever comes into place.  This 2 disc album is not even the best Wu-Tang album, 36 Chamber is, but this one still takes your breath away.  The beats are like instrumental songs of their own, and the MC's crash perfectly in with them on the same level.  Even the weakest of the Wu-Tang MC's are still much stronger than most lyricists these days.  Inspectah Deck is just amazing.  The lyrics and rhymes he writes are some of the best, if not the best ever.  Rza keeps everything so much more powerful with his genius and revolutionary beats.  Ghostface Killah shines throughout with his heart filled and high pitched vocals (especially seen in &quot;Impossible&quot;).  Those are just a few, but everyone on these 2 discs deserves to be mentioned.  All in all, anyone with a brain can listen to this and realize that the 9 men of the Wu-Tang Clan are extremely gifted artists and can at least be appreciated for that.

B00005A46T|5.0|I was at first not a fan of Slipknot, as a matter of fact I at first despised them when their self-titled cd came out.  But after time passed and I was more exposed to them I eventually got into them and learned how to appreciate them.  After I purchased the self-titled cd I listened to it a decent amount of times, but eventually forgot about it and them.  Then last summer I received a promo tape of the \\"Heretic Song\\" and was blown away.  I had to get this album the first day it came out and it totally blew me away as well.  Everything they were so good at in the first cd has been taken a knotch up and is so much better.  This album made me a fan and even inspired me to go see them live, which was one of the greatest live performances I have ever witnessed.  If you're into heavy music I really think you should give this cd a shot.  It is definately the greatest by them so far.
B000008H1Y|4.0|The are too many adjectives to describe this inspired work: folky, accoustic, progressive, harmonious, and catchy all come immediately to mind.  However you describe it, Songs From The Woods is a wonderful recording.<br />And while it lacked the commercial success of Aqualung, or the epic musicianship of Thick As A Brick, it shows a band at the height of it's abilities playing a form of music that few have attempted.  And while I hate labels for music, this could be considered &quot;classic progressive accoustic folk rock&quot;...I prefer calling it classic Tull.<br />The songwriting is wonderful, invoking a woodsy medeival feel that wood be perfectly suited to renaissance fairs, were it not for the drumming and the (albiet sparse) electric guitars...  somewhat similar to Gentle Giant's Freehand album, but not as challenging of a listen.<br />The song &quot;Solstace Bells&quot; brings to mind a Christmas Morning, while the harpsichord and bells of &quot;Velvet Green&quot; bring to mind garden parties in some stately English manor.  <br />One of the high points of this recording is the use of instrumentation.  Every instrument is extremely powerful in it's subtlety.  I consider SOTW to be one of the best orchestrated recordings of the classic progressive era.<br />Lastly, this is a strangly romantic album...and while I would not normally equate Jethro Tull with romantic music, Songs From The Wood makes excellent background music for that quiet, candlelit evening with someone special.  Then again, maybe I'm just weird.<br />Anyway, if you haven't checked out this wonderful piece of music, do so!
B00004W5UA|5.0|This film is amazing.  When I first saw the trailers I expected some macho attempt to satirize the political correctness of the 90's.  Instead it goes much deeper.  It evolves from a editorial on modern materialism to a true psycologial odyssey.  It's definately not to everyone's taste, but if you like dark satire with hints of humor along with an unpredictable, twisting plot, this film is for you.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I thought this would be another cheesy teen movie, and sure...there are traces of it in there...but for the most part it is a truly GREAT flick.  Very witty.  Great acting.  Julia Stiles shines as a brilliant artist!  I loved it so much I bought it on DVD and VHS!!
B000001TVD|5.0|In case you didn't already know....Funkadelic is sort of a spin off of George Clinton's R&amp;B/soul band, Parliment.  To get around legal/royalty issues, Clinton took basically the same band and renamed it Funkadelic.  But instead of featuring the singers, he now featured the back up band.  Eventually, Parliment and Funkadelic was rolled up as the P-Funk Allstars.  <br />Funkadelic was more rock and funk oriented, with a little pyschodelia thrown in.  And, these guys rocked hard.  <br />The title track is what gives this album a five star rating.  It is a searing 9 minute guitar solo.  I don't agree with those that say it is the best solo ever, or that it better than most anything Hendrix has done, but it is still great.  <br />The rest of the album is some very good funk rock.  It is all very lively and energetic.<br />Some people rate this as Clinton's best album.  It is certainly at the top.
0316666343|2.0|After all the publicity and hype, this book is my most disappointing read in a long time.  Sure, there are moments of powerful reflection, especially on the relationship between children and their parents.  But the prose here is pedestrian at best and the characters are hardly developed in interesting ways at all.  And there is no real ending to this book.  Readers looking for interesting and compelling novels would do much better by reading recent novels authored by Geraldine Brooks, Julia Glass, and Kate Jennings, all of which deserve the acclaim, attention, and publicity that this book has received by the mainstream book publishing/advertising industry.
0375507507|4.0|Alexandra Fuller writes well.  Her story of growing up in Africa is an unusual one, and would survive by being character-driven as well as landscape-driven, but due to her well-thought out metaphors and her honest portrayal through the eyes of the child and adolescent that she was, the story flourishes. Her book is despairing, encouraging, cynical, innocent, as varied and buzzing with life as its tropical setting.<br /><br /> It was a rough life, with tropical diseases and snakes and political upheaval.  Likes so many British colonials, her parents were heavy smokers, drinkers, and partiers.  Her father was ever-optimistic: If things didn't work out, they would move on.  Her mother, an animal lover, was good to the natives (she ran a weekly medical clinic out of her kitchen back door) but hotly resented the natives' victory over British rule when Rhodesia became Zimbabwe.  Her mother bore five children but lost three to disease and accidents, and became mentally unstable for a time.<br /><br /> I notice from the back cover notes that Fuller now lives in Wyoming, which strikes me as fitting.  One could hardly expect someone with her hardscrabble, adventurous background to become a tame big-city dweller.
B00005K3NR|4.0|This is definitely one of the classic horror films in history.  It's too bad the movies today do not measure up.  I loved this movie except one thing: what's the deal with the tuxedo scene?  There is a scene where the William Katt character is trying on some tuxedos with a couple of guys.  During the fitting, the film appears to be sped-up or fast forwarded, making the actors sound like chipmunks.  What's surprising here is that the DVD special edition does the same thing.  Was this intentional by the director?  Does anyone have any info on this?  What was the dialog between the actors?  I would like to hear from anyone on this.
B00005Y1Y3|3.0|first of all, im sure all the doors (and sugerman) made a whole lotta money off this cd, and the so called &quot;stoned immaculate:tribute album&quot; which im sure morrison would have hated. and the reason is that ANYTHING by the doors will sell because so little has been released--including some of their best performances. why is this? because the other three doors are sitting on them, waiting for the legend to grow so they can finally release them at the highest price possible.  maybe they should have done it when that horrible movie came out and people were doors crazed for awhile.  one show from 67 in CT (at a high school, believe it or not) is, along with the roundhouse, the best recorded show from the doors i've heard. (you can get it on bootleg, and you should.  jim would never have wanted his art commodified like this, and i think the doors know that--but alas, the money machine's growth may be more to them after all these years than the wishes of the man who made the band and got them successful.<br />i did buy this album, and was pretty disappointed.  there are some cool moments(&quot;why shouldn't i feel goooood&quot;) ,but this seems to have been after morrison lost the fire.<br />make that money, guys.

But it has all the Saturday Night Fever songs, Tragedy, Too Much Heaven, To Love Somebody, Lonely Days, How Can You Mend A Broken Heart, I've Gotta Get A Message To You, Nights On Broadway, Run To Me, Massachusetts, and other great all time favorites. The only thing I don't like is Celine Dion's part with the BeeGees in Immortality because personally, I never liked her. Barry also talks a little in the concert. A woman in the front row gave him a towel to wipe his sweat off with and give back as a keepsake! Olivia Newton John is also in the front row with her daughter. Barry's daughter comes out towards the end to give flowers out to the brothers and Maurice introduces the band to us just before the finishing You Should Be Dancing. So overall, they really did a great job putting this concert together and I'm sure it pleased millions.
0452282152|4.0|I have long admired Vermeer's paintings and in particular, this one.  I picked up this book on a whim as I do not often read fiction.  Tracey Chevalier is a talented and graceful writer.  Her recreation of Dutch life is extremely detailed, yet presented simply.  Some might find this book too subtle, but I thought it perfect.  I read it slowly, all in one sitting and found that the emotions so many of us are addicted to these days were all underlying. They are never blatant, yet when Griet hurts, so does the reader.  Highly recommended and a easy enough read for younger people!
B00000JMOJ|4.0|In this wry and entertaining take on a world gone crazy, where corporate rulers routinely engage popular sport activities to distill public anger and frustration and to try to distract common people from civic unrest, we find perpetual everyman Arnold Schwarzenegger caught in the vise-grip of official lies when he escapes from maximum security prison only to be caught and selected as the latest \\"contestant\\" (read `intended victim' here) for the overwhelmingly popular television program called, appropriately enough, \\"Running Man\\". The point of the game is for the contestant to survive being hunted down by a sewerful of villains while trying to make his way through a nightmarish maze. The villains are a bit campy, ranging from an outrageously garbed electric man who dispatches virtual lightning bolts to fry his prey out of existence to a chainsaw freak who attempts to hack his victims to death while riding his motorcycle.<br />Yet the action sequences more than make up for the sometimes-silly dialogue. The supporting cast is composed of veterans like Richard Dawson as the venomous game-show host and producer, who manipulates every aspect of the game to reach the storyline he has laid out. There are also a lot of cameos here, from Mick Fleetwood as a revolutionary to Jessie \\"The Body\\" Ventura as a sports commentator to Jim Brown as one of the slayers.  The special effects are well done, and the action sequences provide plenty of vicarious violence for the moviegoer. Of course, Arnie has a waft of throwaway one-liners, and we know we are in the hands of experience when he tells Dawson the \\"he'll be back\\". Dawson, of course, not knowing whom he is dealing with, blows off the threat.<br />But the moviegoer knows Arnie will be back, and that he will win the day. This is not an intellectually satisfying film, but it is a good, sold action adventure based on an early story of Steven King's that will keep you amused and entertained. It provided one of a series of sequential hits for Schwarzenegger, and helped to cement his reputation as a bankable superstar. Great stuff for wiling away a snowy winter day. Enjoy!hits for Schwarzenegger, and helped to cement his reputation as a bankable superstar. Great stuff for wiling away a snowy winter day. Enjoy!
B00003CX97|5.0|\\"Bridge\\" is in the ranks of the all time best movies, war and otherwise. The core of the story focuses on a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Burma that holds allied war prisoners, mostly British, led by Alec Guiness a colonel and engineer, a man driven by the duty to maintain his concept of society against all odds and deprivations. The commander of the camp underplayed magnificently by Sessuyu Hayakawa (forgive spelling errors) has the dishonorable job of overseeing this camp rather than fighting the enemy in battle. He can be harsh yet has a certain gentle nobility and does not understand the British mentalitity although he is required to harness it to complete an assignment ie. to build a bridge in this Burmese jungle for the transport of Japanese troops and materiele.<BR> The clash between Guiness and Hayakawa is most subtle. Hayakawa attempts and fails to break Guiness who insists on maintaining class distictions including those between officer and regular soldier. The men,tending to be a slovenly lot are won over by Guiness, his bravery and his call for pride in themselves and their work. Because Guiness can control his men and can put them to good use in building the bridge for Hayakawa, a partnership begins between these two men. Hayakawa gets his bridge; Guiness gets a project to keep his men busy.<BR> A third major player in this movie is William Holden,an American Lieutenant who is also a prisoner in the camp, a realist and a survivor who escapes from the camp in the first third of the movie. The fourth major player is Jack Hawkins, an intellectual and Commano officer, who enjoys war games and commandeers Holden to give up his freedom to go back to the camp with Hawkins and his commando team and blow up the Bridge which has now been completed and is in a most strategic position to effect the course of battle.<br /> The climax occurs when the commando team reaches the camp and are ready to blow up the bridge by now a magnificent structure, a tribute to British workmanship.<br />The Bridge becomes to symbolize more than just a structure, Guiness in a kind of madness has fixated on the edifice and the process forgetting that his men are doing the work of the enemy for the enemy under the supervison of British officers. Hyakawa has given up his pride and honor for the sake of necessity and is going mad with shame. Hawkins, who is injured is totally fixated on the destruction of the Bridge. Holden just wants it all to be over, finish the job and leave.<br />The end culminates in the demolition of the Bridge along with tragic realization that the fixations of Guiness, Hayakawa and Hawkins are a form of madness that have distorted ideals and destroyed lives.
B00005B238|5.0|Possibly one of the most successful and most entertaining science fiction movies ever made was \\"The Predator\\", filmed in the wilds of equatorial Mexico and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as an iron-jawed commando team commander brought in to extract diplomats out of the dense and exotic jungle in some small and un-named unfriendly Central American country. Dropped by stealthy helicopters behind the border, the team proceeds carefully in toward the target destination. Suddenly, the team, composed of action movie stalwarts like Carl Weathers and Jessie \\"The Body\\" Ventura (later to become the popular and unpredictable Governor of Minnesota) and a terrific supporting cast, discovers a wrecked attack helicopter and a platoon of US Army Rangers skinned alive and hung up in the trees.<br />From this moment on everyone knows something bizarre is going down. Once the switch is turned, the movie continually surprises the viewer by never settling for clich&eacute;, but choosing instead to mine old material in fresh and novel ways, building incredible suspense as everyone on the team begins to discover the deepening trouble they are in. Schwarzenegger does a wonderful job here, and his performance shows why he was so appealing in his prime. He is tough, cautious, and very thorough, and yet portrays the character as very human, vulnerable, and at times confused by the events so rapidly transpiring around him and this is not so easy to do for a six foot two, 230 pounds behemoth with a tough as nails image.<br />Yet this image is played with artfully here with clever one-liners and great gallows humor throughout the film, without ever becoming campy or predictable. Early on he recognizes something supernatural is afoot, and shows his willingness to suspend his ordinary judgements in favor of conceding to new possibilities, and it is this willingness to be open and eclectic that makes him such a formidable foe to the alien stalking them. The special effects for the alien are key here, and a lot of rework was done to make him as frightening and believable a character as possible. At first we just get glimpses of shadows and fading images, but eventually he begins to emerge and we se him in all his horrific heavy-metal glory. As Schwarzenegger remarks; this alien is one ugly _______-_______!<br />The resulting clash is a titanic dual that leaves us on the edges of our seats as the plot twists and turns as often as the bewildering tropical topography. The eventual mano-a-mano showdown between the alien and Schwarzenegger is an unbelievably well choreographed set of action sequences, and takes place over several encounters with a wild and unexpected plot twist or two. This is one everyone will love to have on their \\"A-List' for action flicks to take down on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Here is a movie sure to keep you laughing and still on the edge of your seat for hours. This one comes with both thumbs WAY UP!

B000001C6M|5.0|This album is extremely good. Slayer was truly great in their earlier years. You can definately hear the influences in many other great metal bands. When I listen to this album (wich I do a lot) I find it amazing that this was from the early '80s. They were way ahead of their time. Another thing is that many people say \\"Reign In Blood\\" was their best album. I most certainly agree that it was a very fast and good album, but there is just something about this one that I like better. I guess because its more brutal or melodic or something. All I know is that this will always be one of my favorite albums of all time.
0312265859|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Stephanie Plum series but this was by far the best!  I was so rivetted that I had to finish it just so I would know what happened to her.
B00005OAIE|5.0|This album is unbelievable! I can't say enough about it. John Mayer is one of the best guitar players I have ever listened to. Not only does he play with an amazing acoustic sound, but his electric blues stylings on songs such as &quot;Neon&quot;, &quot;Your Body is a Wonderland&quot;, and &quot;City Love&quot;. His sound is original, but obviously influenced by amazing musical legends such as Stevie Ray Vaughn and Dave Matthews. I am a fan of all types of music and he brings all of the genres together into a beautiful style and album. Anybody could by this album and love it.
B000060P79|5.0|Punk rock has a new leader, screw New Found Glory, Simple Plan will take the torch of Punk and lead it in the year 2002. This CD has no shortfalls and every song is awesome. Their lyrics are of typical teenage angst but better expressed and more thought out.This CD is a must buy for any punk fan.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This album, togetether with Slayer's equally powerful, superbly crafted, ultimately inspiring album 'Reign in Blood' must surely go down in the annals of the darkest history, as one of the most finely crafted, truly inspired, passionately performed efforts ever. From the serenity of the introduction, you envisage the crushed skulls and shattered existence of a ruined and wasting civilization in your mind, before the sledgehammer deliverance of raw brutality comes crashing through your skull. You are then treated to 3/4 of an hour of what can ONLY be considered as one of the finest examples of brutal music at it's very, very best....If you only listen to one more song then you really should make sure it it the title track, although the remaining offerings sit comfortably alongside as some of the best songs ever recorded. If you ever try to perform some of this material, be warned, I have tried (guitar/vocals) and have collapsed through exhaustion....A truly profound experience, at it's hardest and brilliant best, this was a band at it's peak of excellence, some may say, me included, never to be reached again, although check out Arise, this has 1 or 2 more wonderous offerings for you.....Enjoy what must be one of the best recordings ever made. Listen, enjoy.
0195145925|1.0|I  am a lay person who reads a great deal of books about time and general/special relativity. Unfortunately, I was duped into buying this book by the reviews on the back of the book and the snazzy cover. <br />However, the author simply rambles on and on and on, and never presents any scientific or mathematical proof that his theory is correct. This is quite simply the worst book on this subject that I have ever read. The \\"End of Time\\" has reinforced my position that I will never again buy another book in a bookstore without first having read the reviews on Amazon.com
0062502182|1.0|I read this book in a day. It's a fast read and interesting little fable. . . .but, the book is too preachy. . .of course you are going to encounter some struggles on your way to realize your dream. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out. The symbolism in the story is too forced. Here's the point. . . .follow your dreams, because only when you realize them will you find peace. . . .if you want to read 160 pages that work you up to tell you just this, than pick up this book, otherwise, just use your common sense.
B000002B7O|5.0|Randy was a genius.  That's all I have to say.  Listen to this and you'll understand.
B000069CWE|5.0|I loved Hybrid Theory, still do.  I was skeptical with an album of just remixes---we all know how uncertain those can be. But this album is excellent.  Takes the old (and very good) tunes and reworks them in compelling ways.<br />Me likey.  You buy.
B00005221L|4.0|I had low expectations when I first saw this movie years ago. I figured it would be another macho action movie with a bunch of muscle-bound men saddled with a weak script. Not at all. \\"Predator\\" is actually a well-acted, suspenseful, cleverly produced thriller from beginning to end. The jungle setting is beautifully photographed, and the alien creature attacking Dutch's team is terrifying. Great special effects. I wouldn't recommend this movie to young kids, though. It's quite gory.
0380977788|2.0|Boy was this a letdown! Don't get me wrong, the writing is very solid, the story is interesting, but...the middle and the end is a build up to an ending that falls flat on its face. I guess there might be a sequel in the works, if so could you please have a story with some bite to it? This was not what I expected from Mr. Gaiman. Plus I could have done without the illustrations. (Not needed)
B000003TAW|5.0|I only recently obtained this cd, but since i have had it, it has become my absolute favorite. Every single track ranges from really good to Great!!! You will find yourself humming these songs long after you put away the cd. Here is a brief overview of what i think of the songs on the CD.<br />Track 1 - My Name is Jonas(8/10)<BR>This is a good, solid track to begin the album with. But it is far from the best track on the CD.  If you love this song, you will be blown away by the rest of the album.<br />Track 2 - No One Else(10/10)<BR>Even though the lyrics feature an obsessive boyfriend, this song is just so darn catchy. One of the better songs on the CD.<br />Track 3 - The World Has Turned and Left Me Here(9/10)<BR>Yet another very good song. Pretty catchy. It's about a guy who gets dumped and feels alone. But the song never gets too dark or depressing, its just good.<br />Track 4 - Buddy Holly(10/10)<BR>This is one of my personal favorites on the album. It has sort of a '60s trippiness to it. Its just such a fun song to listen to and sing along with(at least the chorus).<br />Track 5 - Undone(The Sweater Song) (10/10)<BR>Another one of the highlights of the CD. The lyrics are simple yet abstract. The song uses an unraveling sweater for a metaphor for somthing, you decide what it is. But the song simply has such a great 'rock sound'. I never get tired of this one.<br />Track 6 - Surf Wax America(10/10)<BR>This is the perfect song to have blasting on your way to the beach. The song has a great 'surf rock' sound. Its another really fun song.<br />Track 7 - Say it Ain't So(10/10)<BR>This is another one of my favorites.  Simply a great sounding song. It has a few, regge-ish chords in it that really add a lot to the song.<br />Track 8 - In the Garage(9/10)<BR>This one is another solid song on the album, but other songs are a bit better. Maybe this song is a bit to nerdy(it features a RPG playing, Kiss fan, who has his own garage band). You decide, some people i know, really love this song. <br />Track 9 - Holiday(7/10)<BR>This one seems to be the only 'filler' track on the album. It is still a good song, but not quite up to the greatness of the others.<br />Track 10 - Only In Dreams(15/10)<BR>This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE on the album. Everything about this song is perfect. The lyrics, the sound, it all works together perfectly to make wonderful music. This song is simple, yet everytime you listen you get something new out of it.<br />In conclusion, i would reccomend this CD to anyone, even my mother who is not usually a fan of most rock music liked this CD. And those who appreciate the art of rock will appreciate this cd even more. Any music lover should have this CD. Buy it today!!!<BR>YOU WONT REGRET IT!
038533558X|5.0|Last summer I read &quot;Tell No One&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed it. While searching for books to read on this summer's vacation I came across &quot;Gone For Good&quot;. I was not disappointed. Both were excellent.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It has been more than 3 years since I last bought any American band cd.  I lost interest in today American mainstream bands because of the current music scence.  But things are getting better since I discovered THE STROKES.  It is such a thrill to listen them.  I love their melody, classic rock sound and their driven rythmic guitars and drum beats.  The singer may not have the best voice, but his voice is fitting for the feel of the music.  Forget what people write  about The Stroke as being a &quot;hype&quot; band.  Some pretentious snob would make an unorginal comment that The strokes got a record deal because of their social backgrounds.  Those people got those comments from some SPIN magazine anyway.  Those people dont have anything new to say about The strokes.  Just buy this album and enjoy something that is old but is new.
B0000256VK|5.0|Roxy Music had been around for ten years when \\"Avalon\\" came out, having developed from a dense, rocky sound to the pop-oriented \\"Flesh and Blood\\" in 1980.<br /><br />In this period, the band was huge in Europe with many hit singles, but never reached the Top 20 in the States (their highest peak was with [[ASIN:B0000256VR Manifesto]] at #23). In Australia, they had an uncanny ability to make each album do better than the last, with the debut only reaching #49, but [[ASIN:B0000256VN Flesh and Blood]] going double platinum.<br /><br />Give the pop orientation of [[ASIN:B0000256VN Flesh and Blood]], \\"Avalon\\" is a remarkable revelation. Moving away from the overtly poppy sound of that album, \\"Avalon\\" strips everything down to focus on the dreamlike, keyboards and falsetto voice of frontman Bryan Ferry, with the rest of the band producing only skeletal lines, with the chaotic guitar lines of early albums utterly absent.<br /><br />The whole album is remarkably melodic in a way no other rock album is, and the title tune is one of the finest songs in music history, a moving tale of man-meets woman that has never been bettered for totally feminine dreaminess - even by the Cocteau Twins or Dead Can Dance or Jane Siberry. The backing vocals of Fonzi Thornton and Yanick Etienne make the song sound wonderful beyond description when they sing \\"Dancing, dancing\\" against the sparse percussion backdrop.<br /><br />The rest of \\"Avalon\\" is not far behind the title tune, with \\"More Than This\\" being the hit single that drove the album to over a quarter of a million sales in Australia and three weeks on top of the charts. \\"The Space Between\\" is the fastest song on the album, and despite its relatively prominent saxophone, manages to achieve a sense of wonder that can only be described as brilliant. The surreal \\"The Main Thing\\" is not far behind. \\"Take A Chance With Me\\" and \\"True To Life\\" show Bryan Ferry's falsetto at its most romantically despairing - he admits that things cannot be changed in a manner vatly different from Roxy's early albums. \\"To Turn You On\\" was the B-side from the Australian #1 \\"Jealous Guy\\" and is basically a Bryan Ferry solo tune, with only guitarist Neil Hubbard and bassist Alan Spenner carried over from the rest of the album. Paul Carrack's beautiful piano gives the song a very different, quite soulful tone in a masterful way.<br /><br />\\"Take A Chance With Me\\" was another European single, and shows Andy Mackay's last workout on oboe, perfectly matching the rest of the album.<br /><br />Probably owing to its unusually atmospheric tone, \\"Avalon\\" could get no higher than #53 on the Billboard chart. Also, some critics have seen this album as no more than a work of \\"pop-craft brilliance\\" which is ridiculous when one has a listen to Ferry's keyboard lines - too surreal to be pop by any account.<br /><br />Indeed, \\"Avalon\\" stands as a step ahead of its predecessors with its remarkable beauty and sparseness, made through relatively minimalistic production with a remarkable emphasis on melody. The keyboard melodies are so strong that they stand out clearly even though the songs are very low-key. This beauty has been sorely missed from the charts since it descended.<br /><br />\\"Avalon\\", in a manner almost unique showed utterly conclusively that pre-punk musicians could produce exceptional albums without recoursing to the punks' own methods.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Avalon\\" must rank among rock's greatest albums and no collection should be without it.from Roxy's early albums. \\"To Turn You On\\" was the B-side from the Australian #1 \\"Jealous Guy\\" and is basically a Bryan Ferry solo tune, with only guitarist Neil Hubbard and bassist Alan Spenner carried over from the rest of the album.

B00003CXI1|4.0|If you (and your kids) like fantasy and magic themed movies, you will probably like this movie. I think of this movie as Lord of the Rings for kids, perhaps a more serious Wizard of Oz. The special effects make the physics defying wizardry very realistic, and the kids love it.<br />Unfortunately, evil is portrayed darker than I like my kids to watch. [I'll be a bit vague here to error on the side of not spoiling the movie for you.] The evil wizard (whose name escapes me now) drinks unicorn blood, and the scene with the two-faced man is intense -- based on my parental standards.<br />Nevertheless, a good movie, that for now, will remain well supervised.
B00005OAIE|5.0|this is honestly the best cd u could ever buy! i love evey song on the cd n listen to it constantly!! theres a song on here for everyone!
B000002KDO|5.0|This is one of the only Black Sabbath albums without filler. You can't say that about &quot;Paranoid&quot; as that includes &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; and Rat Salad.&quot; This is also by far the heaviest Black Sabbath albums which is made known in songs such as &quot;Lord of this World&quot; and &quot;Into the Void.&quot; This cd may not have as many well known songs as its predecessor but it tops it in consistency. <br />Sweet Leaf- the coughing is good for the first time you hear it but after that it just makes you laugh. Otherwise this is a heavy song with a memorable riff. I especially like the guitar part in the middle. A<br />After Forever- I like the futuristic feel to this song and the tune surpasses any other on the album. Definately my favorite. A+<br />Embryo- a decent 30 second instrumental. Not that impressive. B-<br />Children of the Grave- very heavy with haunting drums and lyrics. I like the end with the graveyard feel. A<br />Orchid- the second instrumental. Better than Embryo but the tune could have been made longer and better. It seems unfinished. B<br />Lord of this World- a great heavy song similar to Into the Void. B+<br />Into the Void- the heaviest on the album as you can tell by the opening riff. My second favorite just because of the overall feel and tune. A<br />Solitude- crushes Planet Caravan. A long slow tune that I don't think was sung by Ozzy. B<br />As you can see there aren't any bad songs on this album. This is the most underrated Black Sabbath album, probably because it is sandwiched between the overrated Paranoid and way overrated Volume 4.
B00005NWM3|2.0|It's Too Bad, it's stupid...that this album couldn't live up to it's first two singles. I loved How You Remind Me and Too Bad so I decided to buy the cd. A band compared to Staind in lyrics, Nickelback didn't impress me with a few vulgar words. However, the melodies were catchy and I found myself humming Never Again, but not singing it. It deserves a little lower but the melodies is what I was impressed with. So a 2 star rating is a blessing for this cd.
0780626966|5.0|This was a great set. I got it for Christmas and I still love it. All of these movies are very fun to watch and the bonus disc is awesome. If you love this series, then this set will be worth your money.
B000069CWE|5.0|Fans of Linkin Park should be impressed with this cd. The remixes are good and the songs are still great. My December remix was the best on the cd. High Voltage was a bit off because of the unneeded cuss word. But I do believe it was edited out of all the cd's. It still gets a 5 from me.
B000069HK2|5.0|What a great debut album from these Utah natives. It's been quite a while since i have been excited about a brand new band or a brand new release for that matter, but this year was just full of surprises. The Used was definitely one of them! The Used have proven themselves a worthy contender in todays 'emo' scene. It seems that this so called genre has gotten a lot more attention these past few months. The Used is among the best. They mix pure emotion with music that quite simply put, rocks! If i had to describe their sound i would have to say they have the appeal of a pop-punk band, yet they have the urgency of a band like glassjaw or atdi. The way they blend all these genres of music together is quite incredible. From the moment you hear the thumping power of Maybe Memories to the soft balladry (i don't even know if thats a word, hah) of Blue and Yellow, you will be hooked. A great album from a great new artist. These guys will be around for sometime. It's too bad they're not getting the attention they deserve. They are violently intense, yet beautiful at the same time. I have a feeling they'll be big soon. Check em out before they're all over MTV! (not that that's a bad thing)
B000002KHH|5.0|FOUR REASONS TO LISTEN AND KEEP THIS CD:<br />1. War Pigs/Luke's Wall<BR>2. Paranoid<BR>3. Planet Caravan<BR>4. Iron Man<br />I was drivng to Atlanta about ten years ago and for some reason a radio station played side one of the \\"album\\" PARANOID. My first reaction was \\"Black Sabbath- bid deal.\\" I wasn't sure at the time, but I \\"thought\\" I liked some Ozzy Osborne tunes. Anyway, I listened, not expecting to be impressed but hoping <BR>for a surprise. SURPRISE, THIS MUSIC IS GREAT!<br />\\"War Pigs\\" is a little pretentious and overblown, but the strong playing puts you in the mood for what follows: \\"Paranoid.\\" This is a fine, rocking song that still moves me, even though it has been played often on the radio. \\"Planet Caravan\\" is a real treat!<BR>It has a strange 60s sound to it with the hippy-like singing (is that really Ozzy?) and funky drums. I LOVE IT! Finally, the climax song that more than made my day when I first heard this on the highway: \\"Ironman\\" Nuff Said!<br />There are four more songs on the CD, but honestly I have been listening to this CD for a month and everytime I play it, I hit the buttons to repeat the first four songs again. Ozzy Rules!
0066620996|5.0|Collins, in the tradition of the case study, names names and finds unique properties in the management of a number of Fortune 500 companies over a 30 year period. From a unique set of criteria he pursues, with no preconceived notions, what it takes to sustain profitability in a large public corporation which had previously been only mediocre. His findings are clear, well thought out and often surprising. In the realm of business books, this one is especially refreshing for a number of reasons.  <br />This is a hardheaded skeptic's book. What makes it so special is that it does not assign magic to anyone, neither to himself as a writer or to any of the officers interviewed. Collins exposes his own learning process and allows the reader to understand the nuance in the emphasis of each of his concepts as he spells out the skeptical questions that his research team posed and the deliberation they went through.  Collins doesn't come off as a `guru' who has found some magic that only he and a handful of CEOs can see so much as a disciplined and curious leader of a research team struggling with difficult questions.  So not only do you understand what he means as he moves from `chaos to concept', you also see arguments against his initial reasoning. And since he is dedicated only those conclusions supported by facts rather than fitting random companies into some grand theory we see exactly what he sees and why. There is none of breathless exuberance that characterizes so much of business writing.  <br />What is most refreshing and reassuring about this book's studies is that it puts us back in a sensible framework for understanding long term success without making a fetish of `leadership' or `innovation' or `excellence' or other buzzwords. This is the kind of book that demonstrates the sort of objectivity possible in business - it doesn't obfuscate or take the position that there is something mysterious out there. Rather he makes the complex comprehensible and when the answers are simple, they are presented simply. He constantly checks and compares the difference between unsustainable and sustainable profitability. All of Collins' concepts lend themselves to the sorts of metrics upon which rugged methodologies can be built. This is more than a book of management theory; it is a learning tool, which explains itself. I cannot remember the last book where the appendices were as interesting (and sometimes more interesting) than the main text.  <br />It might be corny to say so, but I think his findings are self-rewarding. Working from the premises put forth, it makes sense for smaller companies and organizations some of which might not even be businesses at all. `Good to Great' offers solid lessons among which are that it doesn't take more energy to behave smartly but it does take nerve. Collins dared to work smartly and has created a great book.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This movie of cops and robbers is a classic character driven movie.  Al Pacino, the 24 hour a day cop and Robert DeNiro, the smart career criminal clash.  The character protrayals of these two excellent actors make this movie.  But there are also many outstanding supporting characters and actors including Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Tom Sizemore, Natalie Portman and Jon Voigt.  Each bring their own strong performance to the mix, and the outcome is unmatched for this type of movie.<br />Robert DeNiro runs a crew that takes big heists in a professional and clean manner.  Never touched by the law, smart and courageous.  Al Pacino is about to lose his third marriage because he spends too much time on the job, busting crews like DeNiro's.  It's bound to come to a head and it does near the end.  So many bad guys, so many good guys, such an indepth look into both worlds.  This movie shines in so many aspects.<br />Val Kilmer plays the career criminal with a wife and kid who can't control his gambling.  Tom Sizemore the career criminal with an addiction to the rush of crime.  Robert DeNiro, the smart career criminal that is in it for the money and nothing esle - it's his job.  Natalie Portman as the suicidal unhappy step-child of a caring step-father.  Jon Voight as the career criminal who profits from the risk of others.  Al Pacino as the resutls driven, over the top cop who is just was is needed to try and combat the bad guys.<br />My only complaint was that I personally didn't like the ending.  It went contrary to what I wanted, haha.  And in a way, I felt it cheapened the teachings of one of the characters.  But the movie had long made its impact on me over and over by that point.<br />Don't rent this movie - buy it.  You will LOVE it, watch it again and again.  An absolute classic!
0060930349|4.0|Johnson does an excellent job of telling a story spanning 400 years of American History in best style of a tribal elder.  The book is quite objective and balanced, eventhough, PJ does not shy from showing his preferences, particularly in the 20th century.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the post Nixon period which I did not consider at the same level as the rest of the book.
0780020693|1.0|I'm a Fellini fan, yet I HATED this movie! Watching in disbelief, I could not believe that the director of The White Sheik, 8 1/2, Nights of Cabiria and Juliet of the Spirits (terrific films all) was perpetrating such a disgusting, meandering, pointless vulgar mess. It isn't about \\"memories,\\" it's about having nothing to say.<br />Holding the remote control in hand, I kept telling myself --it's going to get better, it's going to get better. Soon the real movie will begin. And you know what? It never did. <br />I did see the subtitled version, yet I can't imagine what translation would benefit lines like \\"Teacher, may I be excused from class? Fazio has let a stinker,\\" and so on and so on until we are senseless and numb. In this wretched film, Fellini revels in an obsession with flatulence that would make even Mel Brooks blush. YUCK!!! Preserve Fellini's reputation (in your own mind at least) by sparing yourself this sophomoric horror.  I hate to be the one to say it, guys, but let's face it --even the first installment of Porky's was a less terrible film than this.  Eeeeeaagh!!
0061020710|4.0|In The Colour of Magic, Terry Pratchett introduces us to the Discworld, a flat planet held aloft by four great elephants, all of which ride on the back of the cosmic turtle called Great A'Tuin as he (or possibly she) purposely plods through the universe toward his (or her) unknown Destination.  Having read many of the Discworld novels, I was rather struck by the fact that so much of what was to come was incorporated into this original novel, not only in terms of the characters but also in terms of the unique geological, geographical, and meteorological characteristics of the most unique world in the multiverse, from the grandeur of the Rimfall \\"close to the edge\\" to the singular city of Ankh-Morpork to the previously mythical Counterweight Continent.  In terms of characterization, which is one of Pratchett's most gifted abilities, many of the individuals we encounter here are easily recognizable and described in the same exact terms in later novels.  The humor, which is really what makes the Discworld series so wildly popular, is also here in great abundance.  Pratchett can make something very funny with a mere word, deftly structuring sentences in a seemingly simple yet utterly brilliant way that few writers can match even on their best days.  This book isn't as funny as most of the Discworld books that followed, but it can still make you laugh out loud at any given moment.  One thing this book does lack, in comparison with its younger Discworld brethren, is Pratchett's brilliant and heavy use of satire.  It may be wrong of me to judge this novel in comparison with other Discworld novels, but I certainly think the absence of constantly biting satire explains why this book is only incredibly funny rather than downright hilarious.<br />In terms of characters, we meet many important denizens of the Discworld.  First and foremost among these is Rincewind, the most inept wizard ever to walk the halls of Unseen University.  He is not even very good at failing, which says a lot in itself, but he somehow keeps managing to elude Death, which is fortunate because his attempts to stay out of trouble virtually always backfire to land him in hot water.  Rincewind is a fairly taciturn individual, living his life for the sole purpose of not dying.  Thus, when he finds himself serving as a tour guide of sorts to Twoflower, Discworld's first tourist, a man who finds enjoyment in the most precarious situations for no other reason than his belief that no harm will come to a tourist, he is in for a hard time indeed.  Of course, he is helped as well as hindered by the Luggage of Twoflower.  The Luggage is made of sapient pearwood, which means it will follow its master anywhere (and I do mean anywhere), employing a multitude of little feet for its transportation and unhesitatingly attacking any one who gets in its way.  The novel basically relates four adventures of this unlikely trio of characters, taking us from Ankh-Morpork to the temple of Bel-Shamharoth, the hideous Sender of Eight, to the inverted mountain Wyrmberg where dragons exist (well, sort of anyway) and finally to the land of Krull right on the edge of the disc.  Along the way, we are introduced to such wonderful characters as the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, Hrun the Barbarian, and Tethis the water troll.<br />It is difficult to describe Pratchett's humor; it is simple yet complex, sarcastic yet meaningful, flippant yet philosophical, and often deviously subtle.  Certainly, there will be some who don't \\"get\\" Pratchett or who honestly do not find him amusing in the least--such poor souls are to be pitied.  Pratchett's popularity is ample proof of the fact that most people who pick up one of his books do find it highly amusing.  The Colour of Magic isn't Pratchett's best work, but it sets a beautiful table for the huge buffet of laughs and joy to come from the Discworld books that would follow it.a lot in itself, but he somehow keeps managing to elude Death, which is fortunate because his attempts to stay out of trouble virtually always backfire to land him in hot water.

6303460151|1.0|You know you're in trouble when the camera pulls in for a lingering close-up of dog poop.  Then we see someone step in the poop.  Hardy-har-har, Bob Altman, are we supposed to split our sides laffin' at this here real sophisticated-like \\"comedy\\"?  <br />An earlier reviewer asked if anyone knew why Danny Aiello ends up in drag.  Well, I'll tell you why.  Altman needed someone to utterly humiliate, and poor Aiello (a wonderful actor savagely mistreated here) gets saddled with the, um, \\"honors.\\"  As do Forest Whitaker and Linda Hunt.  <br />In fact, trashing actors known for their sensitive portrayals in other (and better) films is the closest thing that Ready to Wear has to a plot.  The degrading scene between Hunt and Stephen Rea left me feeling contaminated.  If the editor Hunt portrays had been a glamorpuss type, then the bit about getting on her knees and pricking her fingers on rose thorns that Rea tosses at her might have been barely amusing.  But Linda Hunt is so delicate that you feel protective of her; the physical contrast between her and the strapping Mr. Rea makes this sequence play like an excerpt from a training film for joining the Nazi party.  It's disgusting.  In its own repellent way, it's nearly as horrific as the dreaded coke bottle in the face nightmare from Altman's The Long Goodbye.  <br />The only performers who transcend this deeply unfunny unforgivable fiasco are Anouk Aimee and Julia Roberts.  Aimee alone is treated with dignity; she brings a real poignancy to her role as a successful businesswoman who's being sold up the river.  Bob does his best to desecrate Julia but she outfoxes him with her devastating smile.  Although her role isn't much, she manages to keep her footing as almost everyone else gets lost in the mudslide.<br />Or is dog poop??
0316666343|5.0|I read this book in two days - a grand feat with two toddlers.  It was very capitivating and entertaining.  There were times I laughed outloud and times I cried from the depths of my soul.  My kids even asked why I was crying then laughing then crying.  I didn't share the book, but I shared how great it was to enjoy such writing.  I have to admit there was one incident that never got explained and that makes me wonder why it was never brought to fruition, but that incident is just one grabbing insite to the horror of death and the beauty of the afterlife this book includes.  Thanks to the author for writting \\"The Lovely Bones\\"
B00000G3Q4|4.0|\\"The Evil Dead,\\" director Sam Raimi's debut, is both astonishingly wicked and divinely silly. The plot of the movie is not something completely different than a lot of horror films out there, but the difference is that this film came out before a lot the copycats, hence becoming one of the most influential horror films of all time.<br />The plot: A group of friends head into the woods to spend a weekend at a cabin. (Simple enough, right?) 2 of the group find a tape in the basement of the cabin and play it, only to release demons and all kinds of madness unto themselves.<br />The amazing thing about this film is the small budget they had to work with. (And don't get me wrong, it shows at times), but the film holds it's own none-the-less, and delivers superior chills and gore. Especially for the year of it's release. The gore/makeup is what really steals the show in this film. Some really good gore effects make for a very entertaining and gross movie. The acting is very good, especially on the part of Bruce Campbell (The film's lead) who really shines through as the lovable but goofy hero, Ash. Take these things and factor in some experimental camera work and an eerie soundtrack and you have a very entertaining horror film.<br />The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is due to the fact that you can see the outrageously small budget at times. Also, 1 or 2 of the supporting cast is a little lackluster.<br />A very annoying thing about this movie is the fact that it has been re-released a bizillion times. If you buy this film, chances are, in a few months, another SE will come out. I saw the Evil Dead: Collector's Edition. The film looks good for it's age and budget and the audio is good, but could be better. The extras are ok. There is a commentary with Bruce Campbell that is very funny.<br />If you're a fan of cheesy horror or gore in general, and you haven't seen this film...Then this is a must have for you. People who don't like the site of blood and dismembered demons, Beware! Cuz there is plenty of that.<br />Enjoy!
0380820846|3.0|I enjoyed reading this romance novel. Yet I think this one, though still above the average (after all it's a Julia Quinn), is much weaker than her other Bridgerton stories. Penelope and Colin whom we all know from her other books about the Bridgertons are both thoroughly likeable, the plot is suspenseful but there's something crucial lacking. Penelope is 28 and Colin 33 when the novel starts and they have known each other for 12 years. While Penelope fell in love with Colin at the very first sight he has never felt any spark of attraction for her so far, he has seen Penelope only as everybody else sees her: A nice, but infinitely plain, self-conscious old maid who is unpopular and lacks in social graces. His most outstanding feeling for her has unfortunately been pity until this novel starts. Unlike in other books Penelope doesn't undergo a great change when she gets older, she's still what she always was, thoroughly likeable, bright and capable of great feeling but also shy, plain and much too obedient towards her horrible mother. She now wears the clothes she has chosen herself but only because her mother has given up on her and thinks her daughter to be unmarriageable. I would have liked it better if Penelope had chosen her own clothes because she stood up to her mother at last. She's a bit of a doormat. Her blind adoration of Colin was somewhat annoying, too. Why he all of a sudden (after the first couple of pages!) feels passionately attracted to her remains a mystery. OK, this is a romance novel and I usually don't ask much for probability. But the authoress should have developed such a tremendous change of heart in a 33 years old man(Colin is no teenager whose feeling is likely to change quickly)in a more plausible and transparent way. The wonderful thing about romance novel authors is that they somehow make the improbable seem possible. Yet unfortunately not here. Colin should have been aware of his attraction to Penelope much later in the book, whereas sheshould have had a serious love crisis when her youthful infatuation collides with the sober reality. After that her shattered feelings could have developed into something deeper, corresponding with Colin's growing attraction to her. This would have added depth and complexity to an altogether  nice, pleasant little story. I think the authoress could have been a bit more daring to her own and the readers benefit. Yet the beautiful and romantic end made up for the somewhat rushed love story.
0812580346|3.0|Sawyer is able to write in a manner that is captivating and intereting.  There is rarely a dull moment in this book; moreover, the idea of viewingt he future for a brief amount of time and the issue of future immutability is one that certainly has interesting philosophical implications.<br /><br />With that said, it is hard to take this book a seriously as perhaps Sawyer would wish.  There is little explanation for the phenomenon of the \\"flahsforward\\" event.  Futhermore, world reaction tot he event reveals Sawyers excessively bright view of human behaviour.  There would be much more than the brief anger and confusion that resulted from many people dying - there would be wars, more death and horror, not logical acceptance!<br /><br />In essence, this is a mystery novel; a man tries to find out who his future murderer will be, and on that level the book succeeds.  It would seems that Sawyer is trying to do too much with this book and is not able to come through.
B000002WU9|4.0|First of all, this is a good album. However its nowhere near the best wu title. There are only six or seven good to very good joints on there, and the production is poor (no clarity to the lyrics, background noise etc) For a really comprehensive classic album buy wu-forever.
B00004Z459|5.0|I really enjoy this cd.  Linkin Park is great and they have a wonderful talent!!!!  The lead singer of Linkin Park is so powerful, and every emotion is shown through his singing.  Every single person in the band has either a good voice or are extremely good at playing their instruments.  Great job Linkin Park!!
B00006690H|5.0|Although Eminem is not the greatest prson in the world you can not denie his talent. His last D, Marshall Mathers LP, was wat you might say VERY different. The Best song's on the tack are White America, Cleanin out my Closet, Without Me, My Dad's Gone Crazy, soldier is good, and lets not forget Hailies Song, where he ACTUALLY SINGS! For the most part anyway. EMinem is one of the greatest because he speaks facts, and sometimes the facts do hurt. But he aint dissin me so who cares?
B00005QDW1|4.0|Before this cd, No Doubt wasn't my style.  But now with their party beats, they are great and they get your adrenaline pumping!!!!  I love the songs \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Hey, Baby!\\"  Good job No Doubt, and keep up the style!!
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Simpering, moronic, confused attempt to jettison H. G. Wells's magnificent story (which has remained in print continuously for more than 105 years) and replace it with a nonsensical plot, almost nonexistent characterizations, and laughable dialogue.  (Yes, I really did burst out laughing when watching this movie in the theater.)  The 1960 George Pal film, with Rod Taylor, has always been criticized for reducing Wells's story to the comic book level.  While there is some justice in this accusation, this new movie makes the 1960 version look like a faithful, Masterpiece Theater style adaptation.<br />Taken solely on its own merits, this is a weak film, without any intelligible motivation by the major characters, and is redeemed solely by a freakish imitation of Edgar Winter by Jeremy Irons, who single-handedly prevents the film from being a complete waste of time and money.<br />Still, the is not the worst \\"adaptation\\" of The Time Machine; there was a made-for-TV movie shown in the 80s, starring John Beck.  No CGI in that one, folks; hadn't been invented yet (\\"Tron\\" was state of the art at the time).<br />Fans of the book will almost universally be disappointed, but those who care only about flashy visuals and big noises will probably enjoy this half-hearted piece of dreck.  My advice: stick to the George Pal version until somebody with talent decides to adapt Time Machine for British TV and gets it right.
B00004RF98|3.0|The movie gets a five, but the package gets a zero in this cheap-o DVD edition. We know there are out-takes (an entire number by Reynolds) and we know there are other materials out there (you can find them on the anniversary VHS edition) but some chintsy exec at MGM gave us zip zero nada on this DVD version!    Yes, this IS the greatest movie musical of all time, bar none. It deserves top drawer treatment, and not the kind of packaging usually reserved for bargain B movies. Shame on MGM. Shame shame shame!     Do not settle for this bottom-of-the-line package. Hold out for a special edition of this American gem!    UPDATE (9.09) Better and more complete editions have come out since I wrote the review for this edition, but at amazon, of course, every review of every edition keeps following the title around. Just use a little caveat emptor and make sure the edition you're looking at is all that it should be.
B000069I1C|2.0|I saw Showtime yesterday and was very much disappointed. What I anticipated to be a comedy/action film similar to Beverly Hills Cop or Lethal Weapon, pairing two of the most talented actors around today, turned out to be mediocre film at best.<br />Both, De Niro and Murphy were visibly uncomfortable, and their scenes together seemed forced. Pity, because I believe with a better script, and tighter direction, it would have worked beautifully, as much as the pairing of De Niro and Billy Crystal did in Analyze This.<br />The idea of the film is quite good though, filming a reality cop show, with a tough no nonesense cop( De Niro) and his forced partner, a show off aspiring actor cop (Murphy).But the whole thing remains an idea, and it does not develop well on screen.<br />Granted, Murphy has some good moments, as he always does, and De Niro is one of the best actors of all time, but sadly it is a waste of their talents.<br />I hope they pair these two actors in another film, with a better script and director,<br />So don't bother even renting this film, let alone think of buying it.
B00005AQF7|5.0|An excellent look at the artistic integrity of hip-hop, young Snoop Doggy Dogg won the hearts of many with this truly beautiful debut album. Always cool with a touch of jazz swing, this album touches even the deepest reaches of the soul with its enchanting sounds and Snoop's clever lyrics and undeniably entertaining drawl. Every single aspect of the album is amazing; as passionate as the moon in a dark forest night. Doggystyle sounds as smooth as the flowing through a pond. In this current day and age of hip-hop, there rarely is anything as fun and innovative as this. Snoop Doggy Dogg definitely out-did himself on this album, and with help from his friend Dr. Dre (who produced every single track, but was not featured on any), Doggystyle can certainly be called a gem.<br />The highlights on this album include the lively \\"G-Funk Introduction\\", which features a running bass line and a verse from the crazy Lady Of Rage, \\"Gin and Juice\\", one of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time, laced by Dr. Dre's signature high-pitched keyboard trills and funky guitar. The best part of the song, though, is signature Snoop, as he turns in the performance of a lifetime. Another amazingly well-done track is \\"The Shiznit\\", which has a flute-looped chorus and one of Snoop's greatest performances on the album, as he spits mind-boggling rhymes, Snoop's razor-sharp remake of Slick Rick's old school hip-hop classic, \\"Lodi Dodi\\", another amazing performance from Snoop, and sultry background vocals from Nancy Fletcher, the famous \\"Murder Was The Case\\", which is a tale told by Snoop reminiscent of Arabian Nights legends. The fast-paced song \\"Serial Killer\\", which features Kurupt, Daz, The D.O.C., and RBX, for an interesting jam, the classic \\"Who Am I (What's My Name?)\\", with a beat signed by Dr. Dre, and one of Snoop's better rap solos. I found it hard to believe that no one here had mentioned the piano-laced \\"For All\\", which features partners Kurupt, Daz, and Lady Of Rage, one of the better tracks (even though Snoop lays out). The very best track is \\"Ain't No Fun (If The Homies Can't Have None)\\", which features Nate Dogg, Kurupt, and Warren G. It has some of the best production I've ever heard, and is the song Mariah Carey sampled for her \\"Heartbreaker (Remix)\\". Other highlights include the gently bouncing \\"Doggy Dogg World\\", which features Daz, Kurupt, and The Dramatics (a famous soul group). It is laced by an acoustic piano and a flute, the piano-laced \\"Gs and Hustlas\\", one of the better tracks, and the head bobbing \\"Pump Pump\\", which definitely bounces, and features Lil' Malik. Those were all the tracks, and they were all excellent. Even \\"Bathtub\\", the introduction to the album, had passion and meaning.<br />To conclude my review, Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle is a hip-hop classic. I enjoyed every aspect of the album. It's pretty obvious why Snoop's other albums weren't as good as this one, and that's because he didn't work with Dr. Dre as much. Snoop's later music is still good, with the exception of The Game Is To Be Sold, Not To Be Told, but he needs to get back with Dre to repeat the greatness of this. Always and forever, Snoop Doggy Dogg's first album will be a classic.
0060930187|5.0|&quot;The Bell Jar&quot; is an excellent piece of literature with a feminest feeling. Sylvia Plath shows you the inner depths of the mind of Esther Greenwood. Her feelings and knowledge are portrayed through what seems like her diary. It was an outstanding book and I absolutely adored reading it.

B000069CWE|5.0|I bought this cd the first day it was out being a huge fan of Linkin Park and was very impressed with 80% of the cd. Some of it I didn't like but for the most part I would recommend it to others. I loved the cd over all.
B000069HKH|5.0|I was really looking forward to a new album and was hoping it was not the commercial pop of &quot;The River&quot; or the screeching, yelling and shouting (instead of singing) on &quot;Born in the USA&quot;.  The first time I saw Springsteen was in 1971 at C.W. Post College on Long Island, New York.  He was the opening act for Leon Russell, on Christmas eve.  He was hypnotic, who was this artist?  That magic was followed with &quot;Greetings from Asbury Park&quot;, &quot;The Wild, Innocent.... &quot;and &quot;Thunderoad&quot;.  Bruce's voice is at its finest, the E Street Band is tight and has never sounded better.  This album is well worth your money and the wait.
B000003S0P|5.0|Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent... And listen also to the band TOOL.
0385484518|5.0|Mitch Albom, the main character in the story, is cleary unsatisfied on how his life has turned out so far.  Mitch switched from being a talented musician, to be a sports writer in Detroit(with long FULL working days), just for the money.  He realizes that something in his life is missing.  He finally figures out what he should really care about in life when he finally meets Morrie (who has come down w/ ALS), his teacher at Brandies University some 16 years ago.<br />Throughout the book, Morrie, who is in his final months of life, talks about life's lessons, about love, family, death, our culture, etc.  Mitch meets at Morrie's house every Tuesday to talk about the next lesson for 14 weeks.  Morrie expresses that there is no life without love, and that without love, people are birds without wings.  Without love, Morrie would not be able to handle his disease as well as he did with loved one's.  Mitch learns what is REALLY important in life, but also learns how to live life TO ITS FULLEST by Morrie's lessons.<br />Mitch Albom has certainly written an outstanding book that has taught people about Morrie's lessons about life.  This is certainly a book for pretty much any age from teenagers all the way to grandparents!  I would definetly  recommend this book to anyone who would be intersted in a great VERY EASY read.  Albom and Morrie have certainly given me some life lessons.<br />Sean Barnett
B000002TYK|5.0|I may have the oddball opinion, but I like the debut of the Foo Fighters much better than anything Nirvana ever did.  I certainly don't understand the comment made by the reviewer of this album saying that &quot;the debut album from his [Dave Grohl's] new band Foo Fighters sounds much like one from the deceased duke of grunge.&quot;  While I have found Nirvana to be heavy and dark and often disturbed, the Foo Fighters debut is light and cheery.  Perhaps it's just a question of mood - Kurt Cobain makes me want to sit in a dark room and keep time by banging my head against the wall, but Dave Grohl and his band make me tap my feet and sing along.<br />Do the smart thing - don't take my word for it.  Don't ride mindlessly along with the groupies down the street, or with the album reviewer, for that matter.  Listen to the Foo Fighters yourself, as well as Nirvana, and make your own decisions.
B0000047CW|5.0|This is the album that kicked off the bossa nova craze in the US over 40 years ago.  In the hands of lesser musicians this style could degenerate into lightweight cocktail music, but not here.  Stan Getz's feathery, soft saxophone playing weaves beautiful melodies over the swaying, dancing Brazilian rhythms.  Charlie Byrd's is terrific on the acoustic guitar and the tunes will get stuck in your head after 3 spins or less.  The only possible complaint is the short playing time -- a mere 35 minutes.<br />  This recording isn't as well-known as Getz/Gilberto but is just as essential.  If you like Getz's playing, be sure to get some of his other, non-bossa-nova recordings as well.  (One more caveat: those looking for more vocals by Astrud or Joao Gilberto will be disappointed -- this CD is entirely instrumental.)
B00005S8FC|5.0|What can I say...this is the best album I have heard in the last couple of years..sexy...turn the lights down and put it thru a nice sound system and lay back...I have a new appreciation of Tango which in the past seemed too rigid and constrictive for my taste...this is some beautiful stuff.
B00005RHGK|1.0|ok, i rented this film hoping for a bit of a fright.... unfortunately, i only got a bit of a giggle. And that wasn't due to comedy written in... this film is sooooo bad! Well, for a horror.  Its the most unbeleiveable piece of film i've seen in many years..Are we supposed to beleive this thing, with comedy gills and wings, is scary?? and the final scene???? Sooo funny!! i can't believe the director thought that would be shocking!! <BR>To be fair, there was a tiny bit of tension at the start, but it was ruined by the characters utter and unbelievable stupidity in returning to the pipe (and getting out of the car, and not driving off, and getting out to find out why the policemans head had landed on their car...a difficult one to figure out!!) I couldn't be scared whilst screaming at the screen to stop being so damn stupid!!<BR>anyway, if cheesey, unbeleivable, predictable horrors are your thing, then rent it.<BR>However, if you have any common sense or imagination you'll be laughing.<br />Monster's Inc. is more frightening.
B000002B1M|4.0|This is Nas 4th best album. In front of it Stillmatic, I Am, and Illmatic. It sharply contrasts from I Am, Illmatic, and Nastrodamous, the more philosophical albums and along with Stillmatic takes on a more grimey approach. Still a very good album with above average lyrics and great beats.<br />Scale of 1-10<BR>Lyrics 8<BR>Beats 10
B000001ESP|5.0|Though they just released \\"Vapor Trails\\" (also a 5 star album), Moving Pictures is THE Definitive Rush album! The album opens with Tom Sawyer, a fast paced song with an awesome synth. This is the song that started me on Rush. Next is Red Barchetta (yes the car). I heard it and it has a nice tune and is lesser know sadly. Personally, I think it is a great song! Next is the astounding instrumental YYZ. It has a fantastic opening and has solos for each member of Rush. Number 4 is Limelight. This song tells about being on stage and this song show's Neil Peart(the drummer)'s writing capabilities. He writes things that move me, you and everyone. The longest song on the CD is \\"The Camera Eye\\". This song mentions New York and London. It is 10:56, so there are obviously instrumental interludes. This one is bright and peppy. Part three of Fear, Witch Hunt, is dark and subtle. It literally is about a Witch Hunt. Last is Vital Signs. Not my favorite on the disk, but it suffices, nonetheless. I don't listen to it as much as the rest, but, it still adds to the musical genius of this band. If you ever see them live, you'll love it! Be sure to try other albums, because their best is on many Cd's spanning almost 30 years.
B00000JCB2|1.0|i didnt think limp bizkit could do any more to destroy rock, or music in general, but with this album, they have obtained the ample achievment of makeing 3 of the worst cds in history....in a row. this is probably the most unwanted birthday present available. the best song on this cd is break stuff, i took its advice, and this cd is no longer in one peice. maybe if LB one day grow up and stop pretending to be depressed and get a real job AND STOP WEARING HATS and start makeing clever music, they will one day make a cd that is listenable, until then, stick with other bands.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Pro: No problems, looks good, and matches the PS2<br />Cons: If you have the extra money you migh as well get the SONY 16mb
B00004XOWM|1.0|LIMP BIZKIT HAVE DONE IT!!! they have made an album worse than significant other, i didnt think it was possible, but they have proven me wrong. hot dog is by far the worst song on the cd, proving that limp bizkit have run out of things to say, even though they have never said anything worthwile or intelligent. dont by this cd, i beg you.
B00000D9TK|5.0|No matter the language, Celine masters it and sings through with emotion.  I'm studying French in school, and I pick up vocabulary from her and her accent.  I do tend to like to hear her in French the most.  I got this album originally cuz my French teacher had it.  I listened to it...well..nothing special at first...the only ones that caught my eye, or ear rather...were &quot;Zora Sourit&quot; because I had already heard that before, and I translated the lyrics...and I loved the message.  But also &quot;L'abandon.&quot;  That is probably my favorite song on this album.  Now though, I love most all of them.  Including, &quot;Je Crois Toi,&quot; &quot;Je Chanterai,&quot; &quot;On Ne Change Pas,&quot; &quot;En Attendent Ses Pas,&quot; &quot;Dans Un Autre Monde,&quot; &quot;Sur Le Mme Bateau,&quot; et ... &quot;S'il Suffisait D'aimer.&quot;  Jean-Jacques Goldman is one of the greatest French song writers I have ever known.  He gives Celine simple tunes that are rather complex in a sense, so that her voice can dominate the piece, and you don't just hear the background stuff.  It's great work, and my second favorite album.
B000001FS3|2.0|In my humble opinion, these four blokes from Ireland simply got lucky with this album - it ain't all that good, save for the hits you always hear on the radio.  In fact, most of it is quite dull when you compare it to hot young bands out there today (ie. Nickelback, Creed, Bush, Bizkit, Blink-182).  <br />My idol Carson Daly claimed much \\"luv\\" for this band, but I'm just not sure why.  To me, U2 are trying to capitalize on political viewpoints and statements to make a living - a very lavish living.  Musically, \\"The Edge,\\" as he is supposedly known, plays these chiming guitar notes that give me a severe migraine, while Bono sings like a cat in pain.  The only saving grace to this album is Larry Mullen Jr.'s hopping drum beats.  That guy should quit this lame band and join someone more metal!!  I bet he'd do quite well.  <br />Well, if you like college music then run, don't walk to your nearest record store, and purchase this travesty.  Otherwise, stick with trooer soundz like Boyz-2-Men, Night Ranger, plus my two favorites:  Bizkit 'n Creed!<br />I'M OUTTA' HERE!!!!
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine came into my life when I was in the Fourth Grade.  I didn't understand her really..what she was saying, that Fly was about her niece...I did understand though...her emotion...you can feel it.  I don't mind her doing remakes, because I usually like hers better.  I am generally not a huge fan of redo's...but she just puts the emotion in them.  Some versions come with the songs &quot;Sola Otra Vez,&quot; &quot;Your Light,&quot; and &quot;(You make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman.&quot;  Australian versions are a little different. Japanese version also includes &quot;To Love You More.&quot;  A year before it's release in the United States.  Sola Otra Vez is the Spanish rendition of &quot;All By Myself.&quot;<BR>&quot;Fly,&quot; &quot;I Don't Know,&quot; and &quot;If That's What It Takes&quot; are English renditions of songs off of &quot;D'eux.&quot; (&quot;Vole,&quot; &quot;Je Sais Pas,&quot; and &quot;Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore.&quot;)  There are FIVE cover songs on this album, which many people have been upset at.  (&quot;River Deep, Mountain High,&quot; &quot;All By Myself,&quot; &quot;It's All Coming Back To Me Now,&quot; &quot;Falling Into You,&quot; and &quot;(You Make Me Feel) Like A Natural Woman.&quot;)  Overall a stellar CD...I think there's a reason it sold over 27,000,000 copies worldwide...;) (10x Platinum in the US!)  In short:  It's definitely a must...
B000002G89|3.0|What were we thinking back then?  This was a top album at the time of its release in 1974, aided by a couple of hit singles -- and, apparently, Clapton's guitar-hero halo, which prevented us from taking a good listen.<br />The recording doesn't age well.  It's largely uninspired, languid 70's rock.  Great cover songs (Motherless Children, Willie and the Hand Jive, I Shot the Sheriff) are run through the de-flavorizer.  Clapton's singing sounds like he's been told to keep it down and his playing shares a \\"don't wake the neighbors\\" restraint.  Where's the fire?  NOT on this album.<br />The best moments are the back-to-back ballads, Please be With Me & Let it Grow.  Dated and sentimental, perhaps, but with great changes and gorgeous arrangements.<br />Clapton may be God, but even God rested on the 7th day.  And now we know at what address.
0316666343|3.0|The beginning of the book was exceptional, however, her transition through heaven was not really covered enough, although the pain felt by the family was very real, even that was not expanded upon as I thought it would be.  Her father and sister seem to me the only real characters. The mother's actions became totally unexplained by the author, in other words not in depth enough to understand her actions within her own mind.
6303589103|5.0|This movie is quite exciting.You have Roy Scheider in the lead role as your hero. He is the lead pilot of an ultra modern helicopter called Blue Thunder, He soon discovers a conspiracy by the government with the usage of Blue Thunder.The villain in this movie is Roddy McDowell.He is the government agent in charge<BR>of the conspiracy. They do battle in the skies. You have outstanding special effects. The skyscrapers in this movie add to<BR>the special effects. The helicopter chases are breathtaking and exciting. This movie is action packed and the actors do a very good job. Watch this movie,you will enjoy it.
6300270696|3.0|Most reviewers have noticed the same thing: this film has great charm, but a terrible music track nearly sinks it. This is why DVDs were invented. If Ridley Scott could release the DVD of &quot;Legend&quot; with the original Jerry Goldsmith score, then Richard Donner can scrape up some better music for one of his best-loved films. It certainly deserves a second chance at being a masterpiece.
B000001FTJ|4.0|To say that the music of Tom Waits is an acquired taste is an understatement.  His combination of spacey jazz, blues, spoken word poetry and down-and-out lyrics are combined with vocals that sound like Bob Dylan's barfly older brother.  The epitome of \\"Swordfishtrombones\\" come on the two minute rant \\"Frank's Wild Years,\\" in which Waits calmy recounts a gruesome tale of a husband murdering his wife with a genrous dose of tongue-in-cheek humor.  Other highliughts include the (relatively) rocking \\"16 Shells from a Thirty-Ought Six\\" (and the memorable refrain \\"I'm gonna whittle you into kindling\\"), the spare \\"Johnsburg, Illinois\\" and the instrumental \\"Just Another Sucker on the Vine.\\"  It should be emphasized, however, that hearing this album for the first time will be jarring for those unfamiliar with Waits's music.<br />Overall, a wonderfully weird album from an truly eccentric and original artist.
6304675348|3.0|...Scream begat all of today's extremely lousy horror flicks. This film is a mockery to even the casual fan of the horror genre. The best thing about this film is the opening fifteen-twenty minutes in which we get to witness a game of cat and mouse between Drew Barrymore's character and an unseen killer on the phone.<br />In all fairness, however, the opening scenes are better than the other 5/6th's of the film.  We get to see Drew Barrymore in her finest perfomance since her critically acclaimed roles E.T. and &quot;Firestarter.&quot;  We get to see Matthew Lillard in the role that made him one of Hollywood's most annoying stars since Gary Busey.  To top it all off, we get to watch the identical twin of Johnny Depp, Skeet Ulrich, act in one of his brightest roles ever. Truly, Scream is a work of unmatchable art.<br />Now for some serious critique. Scream is not scary and focuses far too much on the slash 'em up techniques that Freddy and Jason wore out in the eighties. This film is nothing more than a remedy to a boring evening at home. There is nothing frightening about Scream. No, it is hardly on the same lines as some other great slasher films, unless of course, you enjoy predictable killing scenes and harshly detest Drew Barrymore.<br />Why two stars instead of one? The opening sequences are a fine part to this movie but unfotunately the film continues on a downward spiral from there on out.
B000002UDG|4.0|It is a measure of just how much Paul McCartney missed having John Lennon around (creatively, anyway) that one 17 song volume can collect all the best songs from his post-Beatles career. Any two original Beatles albums contain more essential McCartney material than does his entire solo catlog. That said, \\"All the Best\\" does indeed for the most part collect the highlights from McCartney's wildly uneven solo period. Most of the songs included were hits, from early radio staples like \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" to Wings-period stuff like \\"Silly Love Songs,\\" \\"Band on the Run\\" and \\"Live and Let Die\\" to early-80s efforts like \\"Ebony and Ivory,\\" \\"Say Say Say\\" and \\"No More Lonely Nights.\\" The only glaring ommision I noticed was \\"Take it Away\\" from the album \\"Tug of War,\\" which is one of solo McCartney's best songs and was also a fairly big hit in its own right.<br />Overall, a decent one volume anthology album that should be all of the Paul McCartney most casual fans will need.
B00005QFHG|5.0|....liked this one. Why? Simple, it focuses on a story rather than the chemistry between two characters.<br />It's a delightful tale about the ability to see things differently, even if you have to rub your eyes a little for it to occur. Do not lisent to Jerry Falwell or his band of self-made film critics; this film is hardly a \\"sex-driven\\" film. It has absolutely NO NUDITY and some of the classiest sexual innuendos ever developed.  The films sexual humor is the same type of humor that you'd see your parents teasing each other about in the kitchen. In other words, it's harmless.<br />Give Chocolat a chance and be sure to buy some real chocolates later on. Wink wink.
B000002UUH|5.0|John Lennon had a very up-and-down post-Beatles solo career.  He may have been the more &quot;serious&quot; songwriter of the Lennon-McCartney duo, but without Paul's steadying influence his solo songwriting became very erratic and only occasionally brilliant.  That said, &quot;The John Lennon Collection,&quot; with 19 tracks and 71 minutes of music, stands as a fine testament to Lennon's solo career.  Hitting all the high points and ignoring his lesser moments, it is everything a casual fan could ask for.<br />All of Lennon's best remembered solo works are here, from the Plastic Ono Band anthem &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; to the socialist utopia musings of &quot;Imagine,&quot; to the whimsical &quot;Watching the Wheels&quot; and &quot;Mind Games&quot; to his cover version of &quot;Stand By Me.&quot;  Also included is his holiday staple &quot;Happy Xmas (War is Over)&quot; his tributes to Yoko Ono, &quot;Woman,&quot; &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; and &quot;Dear Yoko,&quot; as well as early hits &quot;Instant Karma&quot; and &quot;Power to the People.&quot;<br />Overall, this substantial one volume anthology album is the perfect helping of John Lennon for the casual fan.
B00003CXZ3|5.0|The most well crafted film in recent memory.  I loved this film but be warned, it may require intense disussion amongst friends at the end of the film.<br />If you like films like the Usual Suspects and LA Confidential(and who doesn't?), then this film will be right up your alley. It has a plot twist that is second to none. Guy Pearce does an astonishing job in this film and you'd never know he was an Aussie from the vocal job he does in this movie.  WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!<br />...
B000002G23|4.0|The Police were really a great band.  Sting's songwriting and vocal style mixed smoothly with Stewart Copeland's erraticaly brilliant drumming, and Andy Summers' atmospheric and jazzy guitar playing.  It was an energetic, stylistic combination that produced a sound that was very unique, and proved that some bands are the equal sum of their parts.  This box set explores every accomplishment the Police ever made, including the musical exploration of the band(reggae-punk mixings, studio pop creations), and the intellectual prowess of Sting's songwriting ability. Sting could turn out beautiful melancholy pieces like the hits &quot;King of Pain,&quot; &quot;Walking on the Moon,&quot; or &quot;Wrapped Around Your Finger,&quot; and also on lesser known gems such as &quot;Walking in Your Footsteps,&quot; or &quot;Driven to Tears.&quot;  <br />What this box set also offers is the ability to digest all of the bad music with the good much easier.  In the midst of all the wonderfull music they made, the Police also put out some mindless songs that really have no place on their albums.  Taken as a whole, it's easier to get through those songs, listening to them as the mistakes they are.  After all, no band is perfect.  The inclusion of the band's early psuedo-punk songs is a plus, because it shows them at the beginning with all the energy and enthusiasm a young band has.  This box set is also a great collection because the price isn't too steep, considering it has a decent booklet and every album the Police ever released.  So if you've heard the hits and really want to hear more of what the Police are about, then this is a good buy.  Also, if you're a musician, this set will really appeal to you because they really did do some amazing things as a trio, that really blow me away as a guitarist/drummer/songwriter.
6302787068|4.0|...YOUR CLOTHES!\\"  That's right, this film has one of the most blatantly perverted lines in Walt Disney history. It's the type of thing that would make Bear-Bear, Bear rabbit, and Pinochio blush from embarassment.  You might have heard rumors and whispers about Dinsey film makers doing this in the past and thought, \\"there's no way that's true.\\"  Well, my good friends, it's very true. Very, very true.<br />With skepticism being one of my natural traits, I investigated this film, as I did after hearing rumors of the same type of thing in films like the Lion King and The Little Murmaid. Well, in Aladin, it's so blatantly obvious that the viewer can't help but laugh.<br />It's the balcony scene, right as the princess comes out from her room and walks past the curtains. You can hear a voice, although quiet and somewhat hushed, say, \\"Good teenagers take off your clothes.\\"  Don't believe me? Listen to it yourself and make sure to listen carefully.<br />Unlike the \\"ghost\\" that is supposedly in Three Men and a Baby and the midget \\"hanging himself\\" in The Wizard of Oz, Aladin provides us with solid, undeniable evidence that some Disney cartoon editors have a little too much fun with their jobs.  If you own this film, you'll find that the previously mentioned part provides a great entertainment piece for dinner parties. Enjoy!
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one of the milestones in rock music for the 90's...It sounds so fresh and powerful years after it was released. Everything here is A-class: I give it 5 stars even for the CD package...I've read some negative reviews by people who just don't get it...it's like trying to explain quantum physics to a philosopher. So please, all you who don't like this album give us a break and don't take  the time to write reviews for it. Just relax listening to ricky martin and stuff like that and let  us &quot;stupid&quot; people in our nirvana...<BR>Anyway, if you buy this CD, get 2 copies minimum... As another reviewer says, CD's don't have great durability...Enjoy!
B00003CXTF|1.0|They sucked us in with the initial trailer, a movie preview that only slightly hinted any kind of romantic sequence. It was packed with an intense track by Hans Zimmer and a total focus on the short battle scenes.  But, after watching this film, I was left thinking, \\"why couldn't the Japs have killed Affleck and Hartnett?\\"  I should have known, though, seeing very clearly that both Hartnett and Affleck would be starring in this war version of Runaway Bride.<br />This is a chick flick disguised as a war film. The film spends 3/4 of itself focusing on a love triangle, and my, my, it just happens to be the love triangle from hell. It's a very unmerciful slap in the face to all those men who fought in World War 2, and those who tragically gave their lives at the real Pearl Harbor. But what's a little dishonor towards American war vets if it means some big bucks for Hollywood, right? Please, people, please.<br />This wasn't even comparable to From Here to Eternity, a film that was known as a chick flick from the get-go. With Pearl Harbor, we are tricked into thinking this movie was going to be a war film, which it cleary is not. If you expect a war film on the same lines as Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, or even The Thin Red Line, this film is not for you. If you do, however, enjoy You've Got Mail set under the tones of a war film, this will certainly float your boat(pun intended).
B000003S0P|5.0|This album is sensational.  Very hard rock is combined with a jazz influence to pummel you before such a thing was considered.  But, be flexible, &quot;Providence&quot; slows things down and has a violin dancing and jumping around in a way that just can't be put into words.  I am a hard rock/metal fan and I can't say enough good things about Red.  Oh, and to give some background, I didn't wake up yesterday and buy this, I bought it on LP in 1975 and was amazed then, as I still am now.  It has its mellow, slow moments, but the power in them is overwhelming.  Actually, to sum it up, the power of this music is overwhelming.   If you just let it in.  There simply is no greater example of what was termed &quot;fusion,&quot; that fleeting wonderful meeting of hard rock and jazz.  The musicianship is stellar - guitar, bass, drums, vocs, there is no weak point, I just can't say enough about this creation.  This music is intense, and completely original - and it works man, it works!!   Enjoy.
B000067CPX|1.0|Evolution?...i sincerly hope this is not their way of evolving as <BR>a band.Im sorry,but this is really bad, in my opinion.I did not like Californication and this is much worse. I kind of liked One Hot Minute...but once again...no thank you. Their best and last decent album was Blood Sugar Sex Magic.Hate to say this, but unless you want more of the last 2 albums, but worse...dont pick this up.It just seems like a waste of great talent to me.
B000002L9W|4.0|After hearing &quot;Eat 'em and Smile&quot; and &quot;5150&quot; I thought that maybe David Lee Roth and Van Halen splitting up wasn't so bad after all.  Then the subsequent albums started coming out and I wished these guys had settled their differences and gotten back together.  This album rocks, lets not beat around the bush.  Only I still think all the songs off both these albums would have sounded better if Van Halen was still together.  It could have been a double album.  But this album, for what it is and isn't, has some rockin' tunes on it.  &quot;Goin' Crazy&quot; is one of Roth's best and &quot;Yankee Rose&quot; will vibrate a jukebox away from the wall.  If you don't care much for the Van Halen sound with Sammy Hagar this album will probably sound better than 5150, I sure think it sounds &quot;heavier&quot;. Check out &quot;Ladies Nite in Buffalo&quot;, it's one of the better songs here too.
0446364495|5.0|I've left a review and I've read all the other reviews.  Some of them were productive and others were not so productive.  I believe that if you truly thought this book was awful, you have never loved another person in your life. All you disbelievers out there need to let go of reality once in a while and have some fun with what you're reading.  Isn't that part of what reading is all about anyways?!?!  I feel bad for those of you who hated it because you have probably never been in love or ever will be.  I'm very much in love...you should try it.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|Somebody tell me who the artist was on the cover of this album.  It seems I heard once that these pictures were drawn by someone in an insane asylum.  Maybe this guy escaped and that's how the idea for 5150 came about.  But aside from that, just what is this stuff?  It rocks your brains out.  I remember listening to this in the summer of '81.  &quot;Mean Street&quot; starts out like it ends...a blow you away rock song.  Then &quot;Dirty Movies&quot;, about some former prom queen some guy notices on the &quot;silver screen&quot;.  &quot;Everything turns out alright&quot;.  There are lots of good songs here and this is some vintage Van Halen but it seems like it's missing something, although I'm not sure what.  &quot;Sunday Afternoon in the Park&quot; is a song this album could stand to lose.  This must have been the one where Ed dropped a beer that landed on the keyboards and &quot;we had a song&quot;.  The material on this album didn't seem to all fit together that well but hey, there is some all out rock here and this CD will stand on its own merits in any Van Halen section.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This is an album that is worth repeated buying when one copy goes badly after numerous spins of it. What Quincy and Michael created is a sheer masterpiece of brilliance. Here you are given the added treats of insightful commentary with home demo's of future classics. Getting a chance to hear Michael with his sibings Randy and Janet was fun and exciting. Of course 'Don't Stop Til You Get Enough' was the beginning of the crowning of the future KING OF POP and this album offers songs to every kind of listener. From pure r&amp;b to pop to just flat out funk it never disappoints.
B00004Y6OA|5.0|Even though I give this album a five I don't think it's Van Halen's magnum opus or even as good as VH 2 but some of the songs are.  \\"And the Cradle Will Rock\\" is one of them, a Van Halen classic.  My favorite song on this album is probably \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\".  \\"Everybody Wants Some\\" and \\"Fools\\" sound ad-lib, but for VH that's no disadvantage.  And \\"Romeo Delight\\" puts an exclamation mark on one hell of an album with some of the greatest guitar you'll ever hear.  I listened to this album all through 1980, but mainly through that unbearably hot summer.  The album gets down like the '80 summer did.  Great guitar on Romeo Delight, takes you to the edge and beyond. I don't think there's another Van Halen album that really tops this one.  I know I said I liked VH 2 better but I think they tie for my favorite VH album.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I didn't really like the first &quot;Star-Wars&quot; trilogy, however, this movie is lowering bad-taste to new depthes. The plot is silly and the jokes insult the intelligence. The 2 adult main actors are too good for this movie, and their talent is wasted in the general lousiness. The kid can be a good actor, he have  potential, but right now he is just a cute-face. <br />However, the special effects are amazing, and the lightsavors are as cool as always. 2 stars and a salut for the special-effects makers.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|The cool thing about this movie is the way the paranoid delusions blend so convincingly with reality.  It really lets you get into Nash's head and see his sickness from his perspective.<br /><br />Other than that, Crowe does an incredible job of playing a geeky professor.  You'd never guess this was an action hero gladiator.  This movie does a good job of keeping you entertained and telling a thorough story, though it leaves a couple loose ends undone.  And how did his son turn out?  Also, though the madness was well explored, but the relationship with his wife was kind of neglected, and I didn't get a good feel for why she put up with the manic side of him, though there must have been something there.<br /><br />The scene where he explains the strategy of 'hooking up' with the females coming into the bar was an amazing analysis of something seemingly banal.  I wish they had gone into his other theories a little bit more, because all we could rely on was the testimony of his colleagues and peers who all said he was brilliant.  I like it better when the movie shows why he's brilliant, not tells us he's brilliant.<br /><br />All in all, though, it's a pretty good story.  Ron Howard has yet to really blow me away, but he consistently puts out thoroughly entertaining flicks.<br /><br />The soundtrack for this movie is superb, though.  Great music for mood or concentration.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins
B00006B1HH|5.0|Anyone that has not seen this movie is CRAZY!!  It's the best movie I have ever seen.  I am only 17 years old and have loved it since I was 3.  When I was little I wouldn't go to bed until I had seen Grease.  I still try to watch it as much as I can.  John Travolta looks great in this movie!  It's so fun to sing and dance to!  It's a true classic!
B0000203YT|5.0|If you want to see a good film about love, lust and tragedy this is the one. Shakespeare wrote amazing story Romeo &amp; Juliet, and in this film it's told how the wolrd's greatest love story was created. Shakespeare who has been in love with Rosaline thinks she's her muse, but she betrays him. So Shakespeare thinks he can't write anything now when his muse is gone. But when he meets a woman called Viola DeLesseps he falls madly in love with her. Who falls in love with him as well. The tragid love story begins like the tragedy of Romeo &amp; Juliet. It's in the same wave length. This beautiful movie is fantastically told. Every part in the movie is just pure genious work, It's perfectly directed and storyline is just fabulous. And the actors are amazing. You have never seen many good actors in a same film, acting so well like they actually really were their characters. They're living their life. Especially Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes are amazing. So, if you're into to tragid love story this is the movie you should watch!!
B00005UQ9F|4.0|I'd heard about this movie for months before I actually rented it on DVD. 2 days after watching the movie, I was still freaked out and seriously thinking twice about sleeping with the lights out. Comparisons to \\"The Shining\\" are absolutely warranted as \\"Session 9\\" is more of a mental exercise and slow burn than a Jason/Freddy Krueger-type bloodfest. Like many of the reviewers, I was a bit confused by the end of the movie. However, after re-watching the film with the commentary of director Brad Anderson and co-writer Stephen Gevedon, everything became much clearer and the smallest, seemingly inconsequential details took on more significance. I hesitate recommending this film to everyone simply because many people just &quot;won't get it,&quot; sort of like some people just don't get &quot;Memento.&quot; So that you won't be disappointed (for the wrong reasons- after all you have every right not to like the movie even if you do understand it) with this movie, go into it knowing that: <BR>1.This is not a ghost story. Don't expect ghosts. No ghosts. <BR>2.This movie starts out very slow and continues that way for quite awhile. If you have a short attention span or lack patience, you might want to skip this one.<BR>3.Be open to the idea that mental instability and being trapped in one's own private hell can be far more terrifying than guys walking around with knives for fingers.<br />Now go forth and be scared!
B00005YUNY|5.0|Jon Anderson (lead vocals), Steve Howe (lead guitar), Chris Squire (bass guitar) and Alan White (drums) decided to fill the void left by departed member Rick Wakeman (keyboards) by touring with various symphony orchestras.  Much of the music of Yes has a classical music sensibility, which lends itself well to full orchestral backing.  This particular DVD was recorded in Amsterdam with the European Festival Orchestra.   The middle-aged members of Yes seem rejuvenated by performing with such a young group in this concert.  That the four members of Yes played so well with over forty members of the orchestra is a testament to the talent and musicianship of all concerned.  &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; and &quot;Gates Of Delirium&quot; are complex pieces of music that especially worked well in this symphonic setting.  During the concert closer &quot;Roundabout,&quot; many of the young women from the orchestra danced on stage, adding to the festive atmosphere.  Of all of the Yes concert videos I've seen, I enjoyed this one the most.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love this girl! Besides being a fellow Canadian, she rocks and is out to prove that she is by far different then all the other women in popular music. Complicated is an enjoyable song and although I've heard all about teens not being themselves, I'll cut her some slack because she is just that awesome. The album shouts out a message loud and clear about not being afraid to be yourself. In Skater Boi, this particular &quot;boi&quot; is not being accepted by this girl who obviously wants to be with him. Avril picks him up and they're happy together. She doesn't care what he wears or who he is, she's just happy to be with him. Nobody's Fool is a statement that this young thing is not going to change for anybody, especially not for some guy. Her trademark seems to be her cutting fashion sense and I have to admit, I want to start wearing ties now because of her. If you're looking for pop with an edge, this is definatly up your alley.
B000001G5A|5.0|im no classical fan, but this cd is awsome! i hope they print it on dvd-a soon! (the cd quality is quite good, but this thing deserves a good 5.1 remake, cd isnt enough any more.)<BR>anyway, i play this LOUD whenever i can, its imerssive! for all you classical haters out there, this one will strike you!<BR>btw, dont bother with tracks 8-end, see &quot;Amadeus&quot; (on dvd) to learn why!...:-)
B00000K3D4|5.0|Every so often a movie comes out that defies all the odds and turns out to be something real special. Different genres are represented by at least one movie that makes this grade. eg 'The Matrix' for action sci fi, 'lord of the Rings' for fantasy, 'Saving Private Ryan' for war movies etc. Labyrinth has the distinction of being in this celebrated company, but in which category? It has elements of a musical, puppetry, fantasy and it's a children's and adults genre. This combination, coupled with the amazing voice of David Bowie and puppetry of Jim Henson is part of what makes this movie wonderful viewing. The wacky fantasy storyline has surprisingly found empathy with both adult and child alike. There is subtlety in the movie as well, which will only be obvious to adults and which poses some tantalisingly hidden questions about the movie and the main actor. Somehow this movie just weaves a fantasmical story, which draws you in and is just fun and tantalising, from beginning to end. In my humble opinion, Labyrinth is a classic
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Every now and then, someone in Hollywood gets the idea to remake something, with the goal of making it better, but usually resulting in a massacre. This butchering of H. G. Wells' &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; is an excellent example of Hollywood going awry, by simply casting aside the original source material to concoct its own story. The movie goes downhill from the beginning, by transferring the story from England to New York City, and basing the motive to explore time not on man's curiosity, but to save the man's fiancee, who is gunned down in a scene straight out of &quot;Batman.&quot;   Essentially, the John Logan screenplay goes off in its own direction, using the Wells source material only when convenient.  Each of the main plot posts of the original are discarded in order to focus on this new story, which, again, is not the story which H. G. Wells wrote.  Therefore, there are no visits to World War One and World War Two, the two most crucial events of the 20th Century. The motives of mankind that led to those events and the perspectives on them as seen through the trips to the future are cast aside, either because modern day Hollywood assumes we're too dumb to understand, or, more likely, because modern day Hollywood is too dumb to understand concepts beyond those seen in soap operas and trashy novels.  Anyone with an interest in a film adaptation of the Wells novel needs to see the 1960s version, which is true to life, and understands the themes the book wanted to explore. This film isn't very smart and bears so little resemblence to the Wells novel, that it shouldn't even be allowed to claim &quot;Based on the novel by H. G. Wells.&quot;  Hopefully, someday Hollywood will learn.  But as the original story suggests, man never learns from its mistakes.
B0000687L5|5.0|I stayed up one Friday night switching through the channels only to come upon this movie.  It captivated me all night.  I laughed, I cried and I was amazed...sometimes all at once.  I spent the next day looking everywhere for this movie as a rental.  No one had it and apparently it is a hard movie to find as the one place we actually found it had only one copy, and it was out.  I finally said I was buying it as it is something I could watch over and over again.  This is a must see, with or without the family, movie.
B000002GYI|5.0|I first heard this record back in summer -83, only fourteen years old. I was at a training camp in football and one of the guys had a recorder and this tape in it. We listened to it the whole week. <BR>In spite of my young age I found this record out of this world. And I have since that not been able to point any other record that has been this extraordinary. <BR>It is truly uncompromising. I think this is definately Kraftwerks finest work. It is a classic. It will stand the test of time.<BR>My favourites are:<BR>&quot;Pocket calculator&quot;- so cool<BR>&quot;Numbers&quot;- a perversion in simplicity and funk!<BR>&quot;It,s more fun to compute&quot;- hypnotizing<BR>Its nice to see so many new artists still using the sound that first emerged through this record. For example &quot;catch&quot; with Kosheen.<BR>A clear buy- no doubt.
B000002KN8|1.0|The only good thing about Speak & Spell is the fact that \\"Ice Machine\\" (best DM song ever, in my eyes) is on it... that is, if you have the version with the B-sides on it.  The rest, while catchy, are downright wussy (especially this version of Photographic; go find the Some Bizarre version or a live version).  The only other remotely listenable song on here is Tora Tora Tora! (though I wouldn't buy the standard album without the extra tracks just for Tora!).
B000002I6V|5.0|Hey, laugh if you will, but this is one of the best albums of the hardcore hippie era, and a still-beloved favorite from my childhood years. These quiet singer-songwriterish tunes are very much in the soft-pop mould of the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash ensemble, which was in one of its periodic stages of disintegration when this album was recorded.  David Crosby and Jerry Garcia pitch in from song to song, adding a melodic country-ish feel throughout.  Overall, this is possibly the best of Nash's solo albums, a cohesive, beautiful, heartfelt set of twee counterculture lullabies.  The dewy-eyed, tender romanticism of Nash's love songs heightens the painful anguish of the political material, the anthemic &quot;Chicago,&quot; which served as a harsh postmortem of the chaotic demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention, and the simpler (and more powerful) &quot;Military Madness,&quot; which gains considerable strength from its understated tone.  This disc also features some of Jerry Garcia's best pedal steel work, particularly on elegaic tunes like &quot;I Used To Be A King.&quot;  I could go on and name all the other songs; in my opinion there isn't a weak tune in the bunch... If you're a staunch, sneering, anti-hippie type, I know -- from experience -- that there is little that I can do to convince you that this record isn't just a bunch of stoned-out,  goopy-headed pablum.  But those of you inclined to be more open-minded may find this disc to be quite rewarding.  It's sugary, but also quite sweet.
B00000I8UF|5.0|This is certainly one of the classics of jazz--one no serious listener should do without.  For those new to jazz, and looking for something good, you don't have to start with Miles or Brubeck; Art Blakey's Moanin' will fill the bill.  Its major strengths are Benny Golson's fine compositions--melodic and accessible, and Lee Morgan's phenomenal trumpet.  Morgan's solo on the beautiful, swinging tune &quot;Along Came Betty&quot; is just perfect. And you'll do perfectly right by choosing this CD if you have any interest at all in jazz.
B00006IUL6|5.0|Ok, that might sound like a cliche line for Insomnia, a remake here of the 1997 foreign version with Stellan Skarsgard, but why not once in a blue moon. Anyway, this is indeed a topper for Christopher Nolan, over his 2001 independent backwards episode Memento, and brings his storytelling skills to a thriller set in Alaska. Thus, Al Pacino plays the cop, a usual part to be sure, yet here brings an excellent feeling of desperation to try and find a way out of the muck of lies and torment that are in his life. And for once, Alaska is shown as it truly is, either all night or all day (there are so many movies that get this wrong it's too lengthy to explain here) and how either one can drive the particular person crazed. Here it is the constant shining of a itty bit of sunlight into his room at 3:30 AM.<br />Pacino is on the case of a killer (Robin Williams) who's victim is a teenage girl. This is handled in a good way, by turning it into not a cops and and bad guys movie, but more of a moral movie, one about getting caught in the most stressful of situations in dealing with control over life and the responsibility it follows. It is not just the acting, which is above par, but also just the downright craft that drags you into the predominately first person dilemma (although Williams brings up some interesting points among his blackmail).<br />One more note: Williams has done something this year to me I'm not sure he's ever done- he has two movies from this year that are both grand dramatic, crazed performances and among his flops and utter misdemeanors (including another one he did this year, Death to Smoochy) there is a bit of praise for the guy. As for the thriller here, one of the years best in conclusion.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Spider-Man rocks! I went into the theater expecting a movie that would be about equal with one of the Batman sequels but I got much more! Not only is this better than ALL the Batman movies but it's the best Comic Book movie adaption ever! Toby Maguire is perfect as Spider-Man! He is totally believable in the role and he is one of the few comic book movie heroes that have depth. Kirsten Dunst is perfectly cast as Mary Jane and her fine acting also brings depth to her character. And Willem Dafoe, Wow! This is surely William Dafoe's BEST on screen role ever! His Green Goblin is the coolest villian ever! The rest of the cast is great as well! Sam Raimi again shows his suberb talent behind the camera and it all assembles together for the Perfect Summer Movie! I am surprised that everybody did not love this great movie! It was well deserving of it's $115 million dollar opening! When the film is over it leaves you wanting more! A sequel hits in May 2004 but until then we will all have to wait for November 1st when the best film of the year thus far hits DVD.
B000002LCI|5.0|This is Depeche Mode's most professional-sounding album.  And to me, it's also their best.  No cheesy songs in the vein of \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\", or mediocre sleep-inducing synth garbage like their stuff off Exciter; Music for the Masses was the pinnacle of DM's career (in terms of the maturity of the songs and the musicianship).  It's better than Violator too.  The only thing that has going for it was \\"Enjoy the Silence\\".  ... DM have now run out of ideas, and their latest release makes this glaringly obvious.  Give up the fake happiness you're wallowing in, guys, and give us something that harkens back to the dark music we love you for!  This is one fan who refuses to buy subpar DM releases... trust me, DM have never been better than on MftM.      <br />Standouts:<BR>Never Let Me Down Again<BR>Strangelove<BR>Little 15<BR>To Have and to Hold<BR>To Have and to Hold [Spanish Taster]
0790729628|2.0|The original release with the voiceover at least made this movie interesting. Without it I am sad to say it is just a slow moving peice of eyecandy. The voiceover though hotly debated was one of the main ingredients that gave this film it's Noir feel.<BR>Also by trying to add to the additional idea that Deckard could be a replicant totally killed whatever effect had been built up throughout the movie.<BR>The short story was much better ....<BR>The DVD itself is subpar and has no extra's of note.
B000002AP1|5.0|Less polished than their previous efforts, and the sound of a band falling apart, &quot;Raw Power&quot; lives up to its title. The raw production, the blaring guitar, Iggy's wailing, the crazy drums, all of them just a sonic blast of four musicians who didn't have the world's greatest amount of talent at their instruments, but yet their music is downright excellent and proficient, and their sense of irreverence and insouciance made them really good musicians for the genre they created. The band self destructed for good after this album, but not after one last assault on the music business.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|This album is so great. You can listen to this at any time of the year and feel totally revitalised. The songs still sound as fresh as they did back in 1984 - 18 years ago!!! Madonna's first album, The First Album sold 3,000,000 in three months. Madonna's big success came when the video to Like A Virgin was played on a little-known music channel called MTV. This propelled Madonna into lofty heights of chart success and worldwide fame. As a result, the Like A Virgin album topped the charts all over the world. It has since gone on to sell more than 20,000,000 copies!!!<br />Track 1 is Material Girl (10/10). Released in March 1985, Material Girl got to No.3 in the UK charts. The video to this is based around the classic Marilyn Manroe film from 1953, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The scene of Madonna in the pink dress walking down a row of men is one of her most famous video scenes. Track 2 is Angel (9/10). This was the fifth single to be released from the Like A Virgin album in September 1985. It got to No.5 in the UK charts. The video to this is composed of clips from her earlier videos such as Lucky Star, Borderline, Like A Virgin and Material Girl. This has the same theme music to Like A Virgin. Track 3 is Like A Virgin (10/10). Released in November 1984, Like A Virgin charted at No.3 in the UK. This was the first single from the album. The video which features Madonna prancing around (aah...the days when Madonna was desperate for attention; \\"look at me!\\" crack me up everytime!) on a gondola in Venice, Italy is another one of her more famous videos. The one thing I don't understand about the video is when the video starts she's in Venice but the World Trade Center (pre-rubble) is in the background! I never knew it used to be in Venice! Track 4 is Over & Over (10/10). This is one of the album's best tracks. The chorus is a bit repetitive but it's fun! It has the same instruments used as in Angel. The Remix version of Over And Over appears on the 1987 album, You Can Dance. The Remix is much better than the Like A Virgin album version! Buy it just to hear that amazing Remix! Track 5 is Love Don't Live Here Anymore (10/10). This was never released as a single but was included as a remix version on her ballad collection album from 1995, Something To Remember. They decided to make a video for it anyway. The video has just one shot of Madonna that zooms in slowly and comes right up to her face then goes back slowly - all this takes about five minutes. Shooting the video can't have taken long! This, along with Bad Girl, Rain and Take A Bow, is one of Madonna's finest ballads of her carrer to date. Track 6 is Dress You Up (10/10). After Into The Groove, came a re-issued version of her debut hit, Holiday. It charted at No.2 in August 1985. After this was Angel which was followed by Gambler which got to No.4 in the UK in October 1985. Following this was the sixth and final single to be released from the Like A Virgin album. Dress You Up was released in December 1985 and got to No.5 in the UK. The video is just her performance from the 1984 Virgin Tour of America. The solo guitar piece towards the end is particulary enjoyable. Track 7 is Shoo-Be-Doo (10/10). This is the second of two ballads on the Like A Virgin album (the other being Love Don't Live Here Anymore). This is quite a long song. It takes a minute or so to get going, but once it does it's very addictive and you'll find yourself singing away to your hearts' content! The saxaphone solo at 3:11 is the best bit. Track 8 is Pretender (9/10). This is another fast-paced pop/dance anthem from Madonna. The lyrics are not exactly the best in the world, but the infectious beat more than makes up for that. The beat for this reminds of the starting of Lucky Star, her second single from her debut album, The First Album. Track 9 is Stay (10/10). I absolutely love this song! It reminds of being on hoilday in an exotic location. This would've been great as a single. There's something about this song that'll make you just want to get up and dance and sing to this classic Madonna pop-anthem!<br />This is one of my favourite Madonna albums - definitely Top 3. It's such a great album. This album proves that, 18 years on, Madonna still reigns as the supreme Queen of Pop!song that'll make you just want to get up and dance and sing to this classic Madonna pop-anthem!<br />This is one of my favourite Madonna albums - definitely Top 3.

0316666343|3.0|I don't think any novel - and I mean ANY novel - could live up to the hype The Lovely Bones has received, and The Lovely Bones is no exception in my humble opinion.  A wonderful debut novel, highly readable and touching, just not the classic that the media would have you believe. Buy this book, but read it on its own terms, not with the outlandish expectations that now dog this fine work of storytelling.
B000067CPX|5.0|This is definitely the best Red Hot Chili Peppers album I've<BR>heard, and one of the best albums I've ever heard.<BR>The album sounds like Californiacation more than the <BR>older Chili Peppers albums. And their are better songs in it <BR>than the first single \\"By The way\\". For people who play<BR>guitar: almost every song has a guitar solo!<BR>The songs that I liked the most are (By order):<br />Don't Forget Me<BR>Dosed<BR>I Could Die For You<BR>Tear<BR>By The Way<BR>Can't Stop<BR>Universally Speaking<br />Those are the songs I liked the most, but the over songs are<BR>great two!
0345413377|2.0|The Amber Spyglass, which wraps up \\"His Dark Materials\\" has its interesting spots, but lacks the vision of its prequels.  Much of the book skips back and forth between characters, most of who don't know whether they're coming or going.  Lyra, who in the previous books, played an interesting leading role, seems to have lost all personality and is used simply as a pawn in the playing out of the story.<br />Near the beginning of the book, events are blown out of proportion into a huge good versus evil battle, which is not really resolved and ends up trickling away.<br />In this volume of the trilogy, it seems that Philip Pullman had written himself into several corners, which he escaped by writing wishy-washy facts into his fantasy world.<br />The whole book is full of prophesizing by the church, by angels, by witches, that Lyra is the brand new EVE and that she must not be tempted by evil, Dr. Mary Malone. (It is never clear what temptation she is laying before the girl)  It seems that everything is solved by Lyra and Will suddenly finding they are attracted to each other.  What an incredibly terrific climax to this mediocre at best novel.  My advice...  Read the first two books, but imagine for yourself a better third part! (It shouldn't be hard!)
B000005IU1|5.0|Rock never sounded so sloppy yet so brilliant until the Stooges came along. They mixed 3 chords in with lyrics about ennui, drugs and sex, and the antics of Iggy Pop, and you've got one hell of a great album. <BR><BR>\\"We Will Fall,\\" is probably my favorite song on the album because it's a trippy, experimental song, but not at all psychedelic. With the help of John Cale's rather sophiscated production and that somber viola at the end of the song, calling it psychedelic is like calling Britney Spears \\"original.\\" This was one of Cale's first musical contributions since being ousted from the Velvet Underground in 1968. The rest of the record is the 3 chord, distorted sogns about teenage angst. And Ron Asheton sure has fun with the wah-wah pedal!<BR><BR>This is another one of those albums that reveals the end of the 60s. It was released in 1969, and was a major album to the disenfranchished and disenchanted youth who were fed up with the hippie idealism, and they were definitely one of the first 'punk' bands. For a while bands had been lurking in the underground writing about the unglamourous side of the drug culture, such as the Velvets, the Mc5, and the Stooges. King Crimson's images were about war and depression, though in the sense of rebellion and signalling the end of an era, they fit into the same category. All those bands poured the gasoline onto the remains of Woodstock, but John Lennon's Plastic Ono band became a mainstream hit and the 60s dream officially ended with his pessimistic and angst-ridden lyrics. But the Stooges debut definitely paved the way for a new era, and millions of imitations later.
B000002LGQ|5.0|I have placed Like A Prayer 7th on my Listmania List of my top 10 Madonna albums. Yes, many of you may think it's cruel but I just don't think this is her best album. I agree that it's a fantastic album, just not her best. I would describe this album as religious, sexy, controversial (no change there then!) and inspirational.<br /><br />Released in April 1989, Like A Prayer went straight to No.1 in the US, the UK and all over Europe and the Far East. It has sold an impressive 14 million copies to date and features some of Madonna's best-loved, most famous hits such as Like A Prayer, Cherish and Express Yourself. The album begins with Like A Prayer, Madonna's biggest hit of the 1980's. The strong, angry bassline is legendary and Madonna's voice is on top form. Recently voted 4th on the 100 Greatest No.1 Singles of All Time, it is my favourite Madonna song ever. It became Madonna's 6th UK No.1 in March 1989 where it topped the chart for three weeks. And what do you get when you make a video featuring stigmata, burning crosses and a black Jesus...the most controversial music video of all time, that's what! The Pope condemed Madonna and banned her from ever setting foot in Italy as religious group strongly protested. Madonna knew that controversy in the music business is...well, big business. Her album sales soared as Madonna was crowned the Queen of Pop. She had sold more than 70 million albums in 6 years and was here to stay! Track 2 is Express Yourself. It peaked at No.5 in the UK in June 1989. The video cost more than $1 million to make and was the second most expensive music video of the 1980's after Michael Jackson's Thriller. The album version is quite different to the Immaculate Collection version; it's worse! I'm sorry to say, but this version is a little cheesy. But there's no denying that it's a true Madonna classic. The third track is Love Song. It's a duet with Prince and is very good. A lot of people don't like this song, but I think it's brilliant. Yes, I do think it goes on for too long, but who cares?! Track 4 is Till Death Do Us Part. This song should have been released as a single, there's no denying that! The pounding bassline and funky beats are splendid for such a serious, moving song. Promise To Try is Track 5. This is a nice ballad but doesn't really do much for the rest of the album. It's probably the worst song on the album, but is still great. The next track is Cherish. Released in September 1989, it peaked at No.3 in the UK. The black and white video was directed by top photographer, Herb Ritts - an all round brilliant song. Track 7 is Dear Jessie. It was released in December 1989 and peaked at No.5 in the UK. The video is just crap! It's animated because Madonna's schedule was too full to film a video. Definetly her worst video to date, but not her worst song. The choruses are up-lifting and catchy. Oh Father is Track 8. It was never released from Like A Prayer, but was later included on Madonna's 1995 ballads album, Something To Remember. The song was eventually released 7 years later, only to peak at a lowly No.16 in the UK in January 1996! Track 9 is Keep It Together. This was released in the US, but never made a UK release. It's a positive pop song that has really good lyrics and choruses. Spanish Eyes is Track 10. This beautiful ballad really showcases Madonna's vocal ability that she so rarely puts to use. The girl flat out sells the song from the bottom of her broken heart (no pun intended, Britney!). The result is the best ballad on the album. The final track is not so much of a song, rather than a twisted Remix! Yes, it's Like A Prayer the wrong way around speeded up! It's very short and is produced by \\"The Powers That Be\\", according to the inlay. She scared the hell out of me when she screams at the end, \\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT'S NOT IN THE COMPUTER?!\\"<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />All in all, this is an album that almost every Madonna fan will treasure forever. The lyrics are brilliant and thought-provoking. The beats are funky and melodic. I know I've said it before and I know I'll say it again, but your CD collection needs this Madonna album. Buy it now!ng. The beats are funky and melodic. I know I've said it before and I know I'll say it again, but your CD collection needs this Madonna album. Buy it now!
0790729628|3.0|I had heard so much about this film for so many years that when I finally had an opportunity to rent it, I pounced on the opportunity.  I vaguely recall having played the computer game many years ago, but didn't remember any of the premise.  All I really knew of the film was that I have been told repeatedly that it is an important science fiction movie that set trends that continue to this day, and that as a fan of film, I ought to see it.  So I did.<br />The film was immediately dark, which I expected, and slow, which I didn't.  Indeed, where I had simply been expecting a standard Harrison Ford action film, I found a deeply emotional film that made me think a little bit.  The subplot about whether or not Deckard is a human is wonderfully done, as it gives the viewer room to draw his own conclusions.  The scene near the end when the final replicant shows himself to be more human than all the humans in the film is tragic, and very well carried off.  And that ending...  I understand that the theatrical version had an additional ending tacked on.  That's a shame; stopping the film where they do is perfect.  I love cliffhangers, and it brings a smile to my face as the screen suddenly goes black and the credits roll.<br />The special effects are splended, especially for the mid-eighties.  If it were made today, it couldn't be carried off too much better.  The overhead views of Los Angeles; the police cars flying through the air - it's all put together very well.  And the sets...  They're so gorgeous.  I mean, they're dirty, dark, and gritty, but the look of the city is so immersive it's hard to believe it was filmed on a studio backlot.  It's suddenly blatantly obvious where George Lucas got his idea for the seedier section of Coruscant seen in \\"Attack of the Clones.\\"<br />All in all, the film was better than I had hoped or dreamed.  Sometimes it seems almost poetic, which is unusual for an action movie.  It made me think.  It's chock full of symbolism.  And at the sametime, it's the exciting movie it's billed as.  And so dark...  Oooh!  I love it!<br />Why, then, did I only give it three stars?  Well, the DVD is the main culprit.  I understand that this was released on DVD in 1997, a bit before DVD really caught on, and so I was not expecting great things where menus and special features are concerned.  Indeed, both scores are practically nonexistant (they're there, but you needn't bother with them).  However, the rest of the package also leaves something to be desired.  Now, I've only seen the widescreen side of the disc, as I can't be bothered with losing half the image when it can be helped.  But the transder is not very good.  The picture is grainy and full of noise.  And the very sides of the image have some weird warping effect going on.  It looks as though the image was projected onto a screen and then videotaped to be converted into DVD format instead of transferred digitally.  And though the surround sound is very well done for two-channel, the general sound quality left something to be desired.  So the technical aspects of the disc itself prevent it from receiving a higher score.<br />The bottom line is that this is a splendid movie that everyone should see.  Now, ever though the disc has problems, I think the film is a worthy addition to my library.  It is definitely worth buying if you don't mind putting up with the quality.  If you do, there is word that perhaps there is a special edition DVD in the works.  It could even include the theatrical version of the film in addition to the director's cut (though why you would want to see another version, I'm not sure).  But copies of this disc can be had fairly cheaply, and I for one am going to go ahead and buy it.

B000006NPY|4.0|People were expecting MCIS Part 2, or even a Siamese Dream remake. Instead they got &quot;Adore,&quot; an electronic, mellow, acoustic album containing very bleak and emotional music. And, many people hated it without giving it a fair chance, some did though. Hell, I wasn't impressed the first time I heard it but then I gave it a few more listens. And I came to love it! <BR><BR>There are a lot of things missing to this CD, true. For you James Iha fans, he doens't have any songs on this record; this record was totally Billy's baby. For you metal fans, no metal songs. For you Jimmy fans, no Jimmy, just electronic programming and session drummers, not to say that it's bad though. It's also way too dark for some. You go from &quot;today is the greatest day I've ever known&quot; to &quot;love is good and love is blond/love is drunken all the time.&quot; The songs run pretty slowly, but they're still brilliantly composed. Not my favorite but still excellent. Better than playing it safe and releasing MCIS Part Two.
B000002LND|5.0|What can you say about Madonna that hasn't already been said before? The fact that she is the most successful female recording artist ever, sold more than 160 million albums worldwide, had more UK No.1 singles and albums that any other female artist and is without a doubt the most famous woman in the world of the past 20 years really does sum up how good she is. When VH1 UK recently conducted a nationwide poll to find the greatest female artist of all-time, I think it was pretty obvious that Madonna would top the list - and she did, with almost one fifth of all 750,000 votes. After seven multi-million selling albums from 1983 to mid-1990 which sold 75 million copies between them, Madonna returned in November 1990 with The Immaculate Collection. It was her way of saying thank you to all her adoring fans by releasing a collection of her best singles to date. It went straight to No.1 in the UK topping the album chart for 9 consecutive weeks, sold almost 4 million copies in the UK alone and now ranks alongside greatest hits collections from the Beatles and Elvis as one of the best greatest hits collections of all-time. Not bad eh?<br />The Immaculate Collection begins with Madonna's three biggest hits from her self-titled debut album; Holiday, Lucky Star and Borderline. All three songs have a certain pop/dance feel to them that are basically about having fun and living life to the max. Holiday is considered to be the one song that invented dance music single-handily, whereas Lucky Star and Borderline follow a similar style. The former with a striking and powerful bassline - instantly infectious and funky, the latter with a brighter, more mellow feel to it with strong vocals, catchy beats and a steady-paced bassline. Tracks 4 and 5 are Like A Virgin and Material Girl respectively. Like A Virgin was the song that made Madonna the international superstar that she is today. Her voice is strong and the catchy, funky choruses were like nothing heard before. Material Girl, on the other hand, is catchy and funky while managing to stay ahead of the game with touches of class and tingly beats. Both songs peaked at No.3 in the UK in November 1984 and March 1985 respectively.<br />Track 6 is Crazy For You and was the soundtrack to the film, Vision Quest. This is the album's first big ballad. Along with an epic bassline and roaring vocals, it's easily one of Madonna's greatest songs ever. This is followed up by Into The Groove, Madonna's first-ever UK No.1 single in August 1985. The bassline on this massive song truly is excellent as it bounces and flows in-between all the otherwise empty cracks in-between those superb lyrics and funky singing! Track 8 is Live To Tell, which peaked at No.2 in April 1986 in the UK. Madonna gets all moody and serious on this phenomenal ballad - the first song to be taken from her highly-anticipated third album True Blue. This is followed by three other songs to be released as singles from True Blue; Papa Don't Preach, Open Your Heart and La Isla Bonita which peaked at No.1, No.4 and No.1 in the UK respectively through June 1986, December 1986 and April 1987. Papa Don't Preach is full of emotion and feeling about teenage pregnancy, while Open Your Heart is taut and determined. La Isla Bonita, on the other hand, is light and wispful, showing just how effortlessly Madonna changes her style and image.<br />In April 1989, after a break of two years, Madonna returned with her fourth studio album, the mature, religious and controversial Like A Prayer. The controversy that surrounded the album helped album sales top 15 million worldwide. The album was bursting with future No.1 smash hits. Track 12 on The Immaculate Collection is Like A Prayer, followed by Express Yourself. The former was released in March 1989 and topped the UK chart for three weeks. The bassline is angry and booming, while Madonna's vocals are sweet and devoted - truly the highlight of Madonna's career. Express Yourself peaked at No.5 in the UK. The video to this song cost $1 million to make - the most expensive video of the 1980's, secondly only to Michael Jackson's Thriller. Cherish is Track 14. The song simply swings with simplicity. The verses are catchy and poppy, while the choruses are deserving of compliments all round to Madonna's sunlit and valentine lyrics. Track 15 is Vogue, undoubtedly another one of Madonna's career highlights. Vogue topped the UK singles chart for four weeks in May 1990 and is officially her biggest selling single to date - a record that still stands almost 13 years later! Vogue was originally intended to close The Immaculate Collection, but two new songs - Justify My Love and Rescue Me - were added a few months before the album's release. The former is a steamy and saucy song from Madonna that peaked at No.2 in the UK, No.1 in the US and shocked the world with its hot video - rated 18+ and banned from MTV. Rescue Me follows a similar pattern, yet the video wasn't banned.<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />All in all, The Immaculate Collection is an essential piece of music history that everyone should own. Even if you're not a fan of Madonna, you will love this album - packed full of hits, no fillers and nearly all the tracks have been remastered (bits added/taken out). If you don't have this amazing greatest hits collection, you really are missing out - buy it now from Amazon!deo to this song cost $1 million to make - the most expensive video of the 1980's, secondly only to Michael Jackson's Thriller.

B00005R2BG|5.0|I LOVE this movie!  Ewan McGregor lights up the stage.  And what a voice!  It's one of his best movies.  Any Ewan McGregor fan HAS to see this movie!<BR>This movie was really wonderful.  It made me laugh and cry.  The first half is generally more happy and funny, while the second half is more dramatic and serious.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are so convincing that you really get into the story and feel for the characters, especially at the end.  The music throughout the movie is also spectacular, even though it is not original.  I never knew that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could sing so well.  (Esp.  Ewan McGregor)<BR>In short, this movie was done fantastically.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  When I saw it the first time, I thought that it was OK, but when I saw it a second and third time, I began to get it, and now I think that it is WONDERFUL!!!

630460288X|4.0|While this film did not break any box office record, the dialog that is laid down by Westley Snipes is worth viewing again. In the original screening, the fast paced rapid delivery was as fast as the bullets speeding from the guns used in the film. Accordingly, a lot of the dialog and humor is missed. To watch it again is to listen and hear all of the nuances of that dialog and the terrific action sounds.  The DVD is has one of the best fully active surround mode sounds
0316666343|5.0|Given the huge volume of reviews already written about Alice Sebold's incredible novel THE LOVELY BONES, I'll be brief.  This is quite simply beautiful and luminous -- don't let the fact that the story is narrated by a 14 year-old murder victim put you off.  There is a gentleness of spirit here as well as a lovely, compelling voice given to this young girl by the author -- there is so much wisdom and healing energy contained herein.  This would be a wonderful read for anyone who is attempting to deal with and focus their grief -- heck, it's a wonderful read for anyone who enjoys well-written, sensitive and imaginative fiction.  THE LOVELY BONES is a lovely gift from a talented writer.
0345404475|1.0|PKD: \\"Maybe I'm a great writer in France because I've got good translators....Somebody suggested I write the translator, Japanese translator, and ask him specific questions about the book. And I could tell something about the Japanese edition that way. And he wrote back. And he was really - I thought the Japanese were suppose to be very polite because I was really wrong. In his first letter he said your book wasn't any good to start with....And he went on like that. I was really amazed how up front he was in his contempt for the book.\\"<br />Translations better than the original (they couldn't possibly be WORSE) might account for international reputation -- to the extent there is one....When I was a kid reading science fiction in the late sixties, I considered the concurrent A writers Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and Fred Hoyle. (Robert Heinlein wrote a little A stuff, \\"A Stranger in a Stranger Land\\", for example, and a lot of B stuff.) I put Philip K. Dick resoundingly in the B category and mostly avoided him. Now re-reading and re-evaluting all these things I consider H. G. Wells and Stanislaw Lem the only consistently good science fiction writers. (Back then Lem wasn't available in English.) I was right on about Dick.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I've been a fan of Pink ever since the first word of \\"There you go\\" hit my ears. Missundaztood is a huge leap of genre for Pink...From funky hip hop to easy fluid infectious rock..<br />The whole Cd is freaking awesome!!!!<br />My faves are : Like a Pill, Numb, Goin To California, and My Vietnam.<br />By releasing this album Pink puts herself on the same wavelink as most every young adult on the planet..We all look for someone who has been through the same things as we are going through or have been through, and she perfectly portrays that by not being afraid to go through the rough times as well as love herself in front of the whole world!<br />If you are looking for a cd that has a song for every mood. Then, Missundaztood is the CD for you!

B000067CPX|5.0|I love this album because it has taste. All of the other albums are great, but these guys are trying somthing new and I love it. The vocals on this album are amazing. If you don't like the music buy it just for the vocals. Of course we love the funky bass stuff, but all the other albums are like that. This has great songs and don't all sound alike.Buy this album
0316666343|5.0|This is the interesting story of young girl who is brutally murdered and then goes to &quot;her&quot; Heaven, where she watches her family, with all their problems on earth, learn, cope and grow older.

B00004XONN|2.0|let me start by saying that I generally like Radiohead. And I would take KID A over any of the current chart toppers. 2 stars is just about the hype around this album. <br />Roger Eno has an album called &quot;Classical Music for People ith no Memory&quot;. A very ironic title for a brilliant album of a brilliant composer who , in this particular CD, has quoted many old cassical composers while producing a completely new work. In a way this tile defines the lack of depth and knowledge of many of contemporary music lovers: we love what we hear, but do not know or care to know where it comes from. The irony is not present on or around &quot;Kid A&quot;. Just the hype -media and consumer hype, the Vanilla Skies, etc. : this is ART, you should understand it, unless you want to be labelled as ignorant. Well, I'm not American, so maybe I am missing something here. Certainly there should be something about Radiohead's popularity beyond pure music that I do not know. Now, like in a wine tasting, all i can do is judge the album by its face value. And the value is mediocre. Would this album sell and get reviewed as much and as well as it has if it was recorded by , say, a band called Audiohead (sorry if there really is a band of this name)? don' think so... <BR>Despite having its few moments of greatness, KID A does not offer anything new or anything interesting.There is nothing new under the sun. many of the techniques and sounds on this record can be found as early as in the 70-ies krautrock and the 3.5 decades of  artrock. There are contemporary electronica artists who produce much more interesting stuff and there are conceptual albums that by far surpass Kid A. There are neglected people strugling for their artistic survival who have produced similar music many years ago and with much more intellectual depth in a single song than in entire KID A - just to mention a certain Michael Gira, formerly of the Swans, now - the Angels of Light. Angels of Light have a dozen reviews on this site, while this one will be over a thousand and a half...Sad, but this is how baandwagons come (and go).
0345440757|5.0|I initially reviewed this book just based on the excerpts shown. After I read it (couldn't put it down), I had to come back and update my review. A little background...My husband and I were transferred to a remote location, far from our friends and relatives and neither of us had any experience with children. It was an easy pregnancy, labor and delivery and the first 2 weeks were also smooth. Somewhere into the 3rd week, I couldn't keep up with our son. He seemed to want to nurse all the time, he rarely napped, and he certainly wasn't sleeping through the night. I read \\"Baby wise\\" but I found their principles too restrictive. Somehow, I stumbled over Tracy's book after I remembered seeing her on the Today Show.<br />Things that I appreciated most about this book are 1)her common sense approach. Being a mom (or dad) isn't rocket science but as you all already know, it takes a bit of practice. <br />This book gave us tips and trades that helped us understand what our baby was trying to express and this knowledge was incredibly invaluable. Ex: The rubbing of the eyes or the pulling of the ears as an indication of fatigue; not offering naps or waiting too long once they're tired causing an over-tired baby; an arched back as an indication of gas (this was a big one for us b/c we weren't burping him long enough).<br />When it came to getting him to sleep through the night, her recommendation for the cluster feeding worked like a charm. He would wake up every 2 or 3 hours and we'd run in at the slightest whimper thinking that he was hungry. The waiting technique that she discussed worked. At first I was taken aback b/c the first night, I must have picked him up about 30 times. It's just as the book described though. By the 3rd night, he whimpered for about 5 minutes and then fell asleep on his own. <br />I'm certainly no expert. I do know that the common sense approach to first understanding what my baby was communicating was just what WE needed. My son's been sleeping through the night since he was 6 weeks. I've since recommended this book to my expectant girlfriends as well as moms that have already had children. I'm looking forward to reading Tracy's book on understanding toddlers. Good luck!
B000002N2P|5.0|I'll admit that when I first heard this CD, I didn't like it that much.  It's not as listener-friendly as their other ones.  All these songs come at a breakneck pace that never slows down throughout the 33 minutes of this album.<BR>The more you listen to it though, the better it gets.  The lyrics are reminisent of the snotty punk rock of Dookie, in songs like &quot;Brat,&quot; where Billie Joe sings &quot;I'm a snot nosed slob without a job.&quot;  He also describes his bleak view on society with lyrics like &quot;The world is a sick machine breeding a mass of sh_t.&quot;<BR>The best songs are &quot;Geek Stink Breath,&quot; &quot;Stuck With Me,&quot; &quot;Armatage Shanks&quot; (a great opener), and &quot;Panic Song&quot; which is a fantastic instrumental for almost two minutes before they launch into their lyrics.<BR>You have to give this CD several listens and be in the right mood to really appreciate the music and lyrics.
B00000J7RZ|2.0|Jennifer Lopez burst onto the music scene in 1999, right in time for the summer. Her debut single \\"If You Had My Love\\" was just burnin up the chart. I thought why not check out her album. Sadly I was disapointed, this album has strong moments but overall falls flat in the end. The highlight is definately \\"Waiting For Tonight\\", the album's second single, however Hex's Momentous Radio Mix of this song is much better than the original version. Other winners include the upbeat \\"Lets Get Loud\\" and the R&B tinged \\"Feelin So Good\\". The rest of the album is weighed down by boring ballads which don't suit her voice very well, the only good ballads are \\"Talk About Us\\" and \\"Should've Never\\". Overall a very bland album.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I saw this movie after it won the Oscar for Best Picture and was quite disappointed that it won at that time because I wanted Lord of the Rings to win.  That view changed after seeing this.  It is extroadinary.  Each character is unique and portrayed with real emotion.  Even though Russell Crowe's accent does waver and falter throughout the movie, the emotion between him and Jennifer Connelly had me sobbing.  This movie is an incredible journey into the believable world of John Nash.  I suggest that everyone sees this movie once.  It's really confusing the first time through, as the plot takes a turn for the worst that leaves you shaking and trying to figure it out for the next half hour.  See it again if it seems confusing, because then you can actually start dissecting it and understand why this movie won Best Picture.
B000002U8A|5.0|By the release of their third album, DD's attempts at upmarket smoothness were starting to look more real, less fake and forced stuff from a hungry 'wannabe' set. Indeed, John Taylor soon moved to NYC (tax exile) while Nick Rhodes chose Paris, France (ditto, tax-exile from Britain).<br />\\"New Moon on Monday\\" is drawn from a belief amongst astrologers that a new moon occurring on a Monday is lucky. (The extended version of this song (on the Strange Behaviour CD) is just as good and considerably different to the 7+RT version.<br />\\"Tiger, Tiger\\" sounds like Nick Rhodes trying life as a pale imitation of what are presumably his 80s Britpop heroes, David Sylvian's outfit, Japan.<br />\\"Union\\" is delighfully decadent and also sounds good in the extended version on Strange Behaviour, a CD that extends the DD singles and de-constructs them ,allowing you to hear the individual instruments more clearly - a nice touch considering that early DD had a tendency to over-play.<br />There is some terrific interplay between guitar and synths on this album (and on much DD stuff). It's a pity Nick Rhodes (synths) and guitarist Andy Taylor were chalk and cheese personality-wise. These guys had truckloads of fans but weren't fans of one another!
B000069HKH|5.0|This is definitely the best Boss recording ever!  The album is an emotional ride that you can't help but say \\"WOW\\"!!  Bruce mingles upbeat, positive songs with many songs that are obviously written about Sept. 11th.  He does it with grace and pure emotion.  You NEED to get this CD!
B00005NWM3|5.0|I love it!  I was reading some of the other reviews and I couldn't believe some of them.  There are some really misguided souls out there who want to be the new voices of grunge.  They write like grunge is some sort of rare art form.  There is no grunge anymore folks.  It's evolved.  Rock was getting staid.  Grunge, punk, rap, and hip hop came along.  Now you hear bands like Staind and Nickelback and these guys take what they like and discard the rest.  That's what music is supposed to do.  That's what bands are supposed to do.  It's entertainment.  Occasionally a SONG makes it over to the &quot;something special&quot; category and it might become a classic someday.  In the meantime you have Silver Side Up.  Great voices.  Great licks.  Pretty darn good lyrics.  It's fun.  It doesn't bore you to tears, and it has flashes of brilliance.  What more could you want?
B000067JG3|4.0|This is great, EXCEPTthere are no extras, and no Entr' Acte.
B000002L9O|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Ramones albums. I will probably be tarred and feathered by the Ramones faithful but there is little not to love on this album. From the song about the love of Sid and Nancy...Love Kills to Bonzo goes to Bitburg....hell what a ride. Yup, the Ramones got political for a moment. \\"I see Johnny being pissed that this song was ever produced.\\" The Ramones gained a bit of an edge on this album and it has never felt dated or diminished in any way over the<BR>years. This album makes me even sadder when i listen to it. To think there is not going to be any more music from the boys. Hell, what a sad state of affairs.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|I'm sorry, but I just couldn't resist that one.  I been wanting to say that ever since this movie first came out.  All jokes aside though, Will Smith really does turn in a pretty convincing performance as one of the most exciting and provocative figures in history.  The heart and passion he put into his performance is clearly evident, and that's something you just have to admire.  And I honestly wish I could base my opinion solely on his performance, so I could give the overall movie a higher rating, but, alas, a real fan or critic just can't fairly do that, so I'm forced to look at it all wich doesn't measure up unfortunately.<br />After all the hype surrounding this movie, dating all the way back to when it was in the development process and the talk in the rumor mill of all the training that Smith was undergoing to muscle up and really tackle the role, I just had really high expectations for it.  But, the finished product is just less-than-stellar.  And most of this is due to an incredibly choppy and confusing script.  One of the big problems with the writing is that it leaves several crucial points unresolved, for example it never goes into depth about the failures of Ali's first two marriages.  Instead it breezes right by the problems and tensions as if they're just trivial little facts.  This belies another problem in this movie which is the chronological order of events.  It's not that it doesn't follow the chronological order of Ali's life, but it never lets us know EXACTLY WHERE we're at.  We're given a date of 1964 at the beginning, but after that nothing.  Are we just s'posed to figure it out for ourselves or be able to follow along well enough to know when a year goes by, two years?  And Smith doesn't really age at all over the course of the film so that makes it even more difficult.  So that aspect of it really aggravated me.  Most of the cast have good chemistry together, and a few of the supporting players actually turn in excellent work as well, particularly Jaimie Fox as \\"Bundini\\" Brown, and John Voight, who gave an incredibly authentic performance as Howard Cossell.  Nona Gaye's breakthrough performance as Ali's second wife Belinda, is quite admirable considering she was given very little to work with.<br />Basically, a few re-writes in the script and maybe a different director would've suited this movie just fine.  That's not to say that Michael Mann hacked 'Ali' up for all it was worth; it's a very beautiful-looking film, using popular music from the '60s and '70s quite well to heighten the emotions of some scenes as well as give an authentic aura of the time period, but the overall feeling is style over substance.  I like Mann as a director, he's done good work in the past with movies like 'Heat' and the widely-acclaimed 'The Insider', but he just wasn't the right man for the job.  <br />The only two moments of the film which really grabbed my attention were Ali's emotional reaction upon hearing of Malcolm X's death, and the final boxing match in Zaire with George Foreman, so I'd say to at least rent the movie for those scenes alone, as well as to see some of the great performances.  Just don't expect to be totally grabbed by it all.  The DVD has basically no features, which kind of surprised me, but didn't really bother me, since I don't really care about the details of how this film was made.  All I would've cared about is maybe seeing some interviews with the real Ali, and maybe some television archives of some of his boxing matches and press conferences.  Now, don't let my dryness fool ya, this is NOT by any means a terrible movie.  It's just it could've been much, MUCH better.
B000001E7V|5.0|I truly don't have the talent to write a review that would give this ablum it's proper do.  So what follows may seem a bit non-sequitor.  <BR>Brimming full of sexual frustration and urban despiration, Tricky created a debut ligitmizing the artisic force of the movement known as Bristolian trip-hop.  But as important as Maxinquaye may be to modern popular music, thats not why its millions of fans love it.  This one gets personal.  More so than any of his later works, this album easily becomes intimate.   Using rythm in lyric, broken beat and reflective passage, Tricky slowly begins to borrow his way into this listner's concious allowing them to see themselves through his distorted vision.  A feat most artists attempt their whole carrer with out succeeding.  <br />An important warning:  Owning this album will make you a Tricky fan, and that is one of the most frustrating things in this world.  Tricky has spent the rest of his carreer showcasing his immense talent hidden deep within self-indulgent mis-inspired projects.  All of his other albums contain songs worth the price of admission, but force you to waddle through increasing levels of cerebral muck.  <br />If you do enjoy this album, you owe to yourself to check out the Baby Namboos, a project Tricky helped on that sounds closest to Maxinquaye.
B000066F6H|1.0|This CD just [disappoints]...it's your average CD and the music is really freakin annoying I can't listen to it for very long, it's very simple and repetetive...try the Doves instead.
B000003TAR|5.0|There are too many ways to count. Let's just say it's one of the best albums EVER!
B00005B4GU|3.0|I never really liked Radiohead, other than some of the hits that hit MTV, they just sounded mellow and boring. In their latest venture in to art-music-..., Amnesiac comes off like every other annoying album of theirs, but with an extra taste of how much these guys try to be original and creative, but fail and 'create' just plain experimental [not good]. I'd compare them with some of today's one-hit-wonders, as they are just riding on that distinct sound that was lost so many albums ago, trying to bring it back and get more money... People say Radiohead's members spend tons of time perfecting their albums... Maybe, but why do they still stinkso bad and only catch the attention of fruit-cakes who prefer tea to Coke.
B000002C1V|2.0|This is not a good Floyd album, even though I liked aome of the songs.
0451167716|5.0|This is the best writer to create a saga of one family and this is the best saga ever created.
B000002UJQ|5.0|There is no album better then this. Take some Nirvana and Pink Floyd. Mix thoroughly. Add some fresh extract of Queen to taste. You haven't quite got it yet. You need some brilliant songwriting, musicians and special effects. That only scratches the surface of this timeless album that I never tire of.
0786889284|2.0|Pearson knows how to create real tension and exciting situations. Some parts of this book are too drawn out, he often explains the obvious (at length), but overall it is quite an entertaining read. Minor problems for me are that the author describes Detective Boldt as extremely clever, yet somehow he misses a lot of clues. In addition, a lot of events are telegraphed, which for me is never really satisfying, but of course might be considered rewarding for other readers ('I knew this was going to happen..'). The worst part for me is clearly Pearson's naive and uncritical view of psychology and psychic phenomenon. This is not something I mind in fiction in general, but if a story is presented in such a realistic way, it just rubs me the wrong way. If you have a scientific background or are a critical thinker, this book will most likely be painful to read. Others will probably have a pretty good time.
0425107469|5.0|This book was the best book I have ever read. Period.
0140277447|5.0|The Rape of Nanking is a bitter episode of human brutality, and it's difficult to read the chronicle without feeling twinges of remorse and horror, even more than 55 years later.  The suffering pressed upon the Chinese by the Japanese invaders is harrowing, yet at the same time, oddly compelling; one wonders what could have propelled these soldiers and officers to commit such unspeakable crimes.  That the majority of the perpetrators were never prosecuted by the United Nations is unforgiveable, especially in light of film footage and other damning documentation provided by American missionaries and--believe it or not--a Nazi named Rabe who lived in Nanjing at the time.  Self-possessed Japanese citizens to this day deny this event ever occurred, despite the evidence to the contrary.  This is perhaps the last insult added to injury...that so many thousands could have perished unnoticed, and that the aggressors know no shame for their actions.
B00005A1PR|5.0|If you don't have this CD by now, go get it. Every song is solid vocally and instrumentally.  I loved it so much I &quot;borrowed&quot; it from a family member ;-)<br />It's a shame she hasn't received her deserved amount of appreciation from the music industry and music consumers.<br />Stand out cuts:<BR>Strength, Courage, and Wisdom<BR>I See God in You<BR>Ready for Love (a favorite)<BR>Brown Skin (another favorite)<br />Got it? Good.  Don't got it?  Hurry, go get it!
0671027344|4.0|Stephen Chbosky has written a coming of age story that will be around for a long long time. It encourages you to be yourself and to be open to new experiences. Charlie is a bright, inquisitive, and compassionate boy who has lived through some loneliness. He appears different from the rest of his family, who act carefree and uninhibited. Charlie demonstrates a thoughtfulness rare in people his age, often causing him to act in ways no one seems to understand. I can really relate to that and to his wishing to feel \\"infinite\\". However, this book has some mature content that shouldn't be read by anyone younger than about 14 or 15. Charlie starts the book as a very sheltered high school freshman and is changed by two high school seniors. It is good that he saw how things really are, but sometimes (perhaps I am sheltered myself) I was disappointed in what Charlie did. I also thought it was unrealistic for him to do those things, considering how sheltered he once was. He does all right though, and the book overall is enjoyable and inspiring, speckled with both humor and drama. The writing style itself is almost annoyingly simple and the plot is very easy to understand, but the depth with which Charlie probes his surroundings and himself and the other characters makes up for it. This book serves as a salute to the shy ones and makes them want to \\"participate\\" and seek the unconditional friendships that Charlie finds. Personally I hope for a sequel!
6302859204|3.0|Fire in the Sky is striking for its statement: superior &quot;entities&quot; (whether they come from outer space, from another reality, or simply from the witness imagination) are neither necessarily benevolent...nor bad...or good, they might simply consider us as lab rats. It is with detachment and indifference that they examine their catches. We are abducted, restrained, examined, tagged, preserved, killed or simply released in our &quot;safe&quot; reality, depending on what they (the entities) feel might be useful for them. Like catching a fish, just for the pleasure of it, and then throwing the fish back in the water. Do we feel guilty in doing this ? It is very interesting to note that these aliens are quite similar to us: same anthropomorphic appearance and same cruelty but very scary face features. Demons. They might in fact be a mirror image of us. A manifestation of our deep subconscious nightmares, alternate life options born from the same collective unconscious. A movie you will not forget that easily because it sounds so real. Not for children and sensible persons.
B000069CWE|5.0|Usually I tend to think that remix albums are very ...  Consequently, when I learned that Linkin Park was releasing one I dreaded that it would be a failure like Limp Bizkit's.  I also wasn't too fond with Pts of Athrty when I heard it.  However, being the devoted LP fan I am, I got the cd on the first day and found myself surprised.  No way is Reanimation like a normal J.Lo or Limp Bizkit remix album...Linkin Park actually got talented, underground artists to reinterperate their songs...not the usual Thunderpuss remixers or Neptunes. The songs on Reanimation sound so different from the original versions on Hybrid Theory that it is amazing. <br />Some of the new remixed versions of songs sound better than their original version ie. By Myself, With You, Runaway, and One Step Closer.   The best songs are P5hng Me A*ay, WTH>You, KRWLING (its so melodic with aaron lewis), MY<DSMBR, By_MYSLF, and 1STP KLOSR.  The only downpoints of the album are the interludes because they waste time.  Also KYUR4 TH ICH turned out horribly in my opinion. It sound like a bunch of aliens flying in a spaceship.  But I love Phoenix's cello and viola playing. <br />Overall  I like how Reanimation sounds like LP actually spent time and care with this album...most artists just hire ppl to remix and it sounds rushed aand uncared for.  I think Linkin Park covers a lot of ground with this album more than Hybrid Theory because with Reanimation you can feel music genres of hip hop and rock really being mixed. I reccommend this album if you like hip hop and like to hear something different.
B0000067L4|4.0|As The Grateful Dead was more famous for their live shows, this album illustrates the amazing power with Cream's live shows.<br />Their best work was with the long jams. &quot;I'm so glad&quot; has got to be one of the best.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Matt (the lead singer) sounds like Jeff Buckley, that's all you need to know.  He has a great voice.  Seriously though, they are unique, melding lots of sounds together.  Bliss and Feeling Good are amazing songs.
0385486804|5.0|Into the Wild is a wonderful story about a free spirit.  It is an adventure for the 20th century.  Have you ever wondered what it would be like to give up all of the things that society has termed essential.  I have...but only imagined it...McCandless actually did it...!<br />This is a story about/or an attempt to understand spirits like Chris McCandless.  This is a young man who grew up in a middle to upper class family, graduated - I'm assuming - in the top of his class at Emory University, and is loved by everyone that he meets.  It's not about a young man who grew up in a unstable home, but one that always felt the tug of adventure and the desire to push one's emotional and physical well being to the ultimate limits.<br />Krakauer tells the story using McCandless's own words (from his journal) and from interviews with family and those he met on his journeys...Krakauer also trys to give us insight into why McCandless would do the things he does by using his own personal experiences and stories of individuals of history that did the very thing McCandless had just done.<br />Although I wish that Krakauer could tell us what really was going on in McCandless's mind...one must remember that McCandless is dead...and thus an impossibility...Krakauer does an amazing job with the little information that is available...He also gives us multiple theories, of why, throughout the book.<br />This is a must read for all...(My grandmother who is 86 years old picked it up of the coffee table and started reading it...she borrowed it and loved it....maybe for not the same reasons as myself, but for her own...)
B00005KHJT|5.0|Hallowwen is a great movie. I believe that most of the Halloween's are great for exception of 3, 4, and 5. All in all Micheal Myers will always be the scarest creations alive.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Edgy and defiant, Pink's new CD is a trip back to the days of Janis Joplin.  Her songwriting is unique, backed up by her superb vocals.  This is not just another studio singer.  While &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; provided her the fast track to the top of the charts, the remaining songs on this CD won't disappoint.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I've seen this CD for months and I have given serious thought to buying it, but when I saw it on sale on impulse I said yes.  I should have made the purchase sooner.  The voice with the touch of twang and something that remindsme of Sarah.  Her cover of Cold Cold Heart is worth the price of the CD alone, then the title track a truly beautiful song.  She has the voice and the ability to interpret a song I hope on her next CD her selection of material is as varied and delightful
B00005QW4K|4.0|This release of 'Army of Darkness' is the original cut of the film, the way Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Rob Tapert intended it to be shown. Included are 15 minutes of footage that were cut for various reasons, including the original ending sequence. These additions alone are reason enough to own this release, as is the excellent commentary by the creators. However, if you want just one version of the film, I suggest buying the theatrical release version, also available on DVD. This version, although complete, is comprised of very rough footage, and you can definately see where original footage ends and added footage begins. The quality is definately worse for the added scenes. This version is good for the extra stuff, however, and is a definate plus for fans who are already AOD fans.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Make NO mistake! This is a B rated movie at BEST!
B00001ODHJ|4.0|'Army of Darkness' is the great follow-up to 'Evil Dead 2', and throws the hapless character of Ash into the past to fight more evil...dead. This film remains my favourite of the 'Evil Dead' movies. This one is far more lighter than the first two films, mixing comedy with the gore and monsters. Heck, even the gore isn't really that bad.<br />Bruce Campbell wears the one-liner throwing Ash like a second skin. This is the role he will always be remembered for. Ash is quite the contrast, switching between hero and coward and back again as the movie rolls on. The other cast members are good too, treating the material in the film as a serious threat, and not as camp. Embeth Davidtz especially is a pleasure to watch.<br />This film is also one of the first to really depict the true Sam Raimi style, and would the set the stage for some of his other projects like 'Darkman' and 'Quick and the Dead'. <br />Sure the effects are cheese, and the story isn't that great, but the action is fun and the actors are funny. This film is just one of those guilty pleasures to have.<br />This version of the DVD contains an excellent little featurette, 'The Men Behind the Army of Darkness'. It's a good look at the lovable goofs who were responsible for this movie.
B00005JKGK|2.0|I am under the impression that many people find this movie uplifting.  I wanted to stick my head in the oven.  The cast is impressive, but this movie is one long downer.  Everyone seems to have a great deal of money, all the characters are beautiful, but all the women are soulful and in a great deal of pain and all the men are cardboard cutouts full of malice and stupidity.  I have not read the book, but can only hope for the sake of the millions that bought it that it is much, much better than this.
B00003CXXR|5.0|I love everything about this movie. After the tragedy that was Jurassic Park 2 I didn't know what to expect from the third but, WOW. I cant believe I love a third installment of a movie so much. If anyone says this movie is terrible don't listen to them. The special effects are truly amazing, especially the raptors. If you aren't going to buy this movie, borrow it or at least give some thaught to renting it, although nothing quite compares to the big screen experience. BUY BUY BUY. I did and it was worth every last penny. Anyone who liked the original will love this.
B000022TSV|5.0|I have been fortunate to attend opera for over 25 years and have purchased a number to own, from my original 33-1/3 records to VHS and now DVD.  I own both VHS and DVD versions of Carmen and have given away about 6 copies to friends who weren't &quot;sure they'd like opera.&quot;  All rate Carmen as outstanding and it has provided a doorway for them to enjoy others.  I think Carmen is a wonderful combination of great music, wonderful photography, and best of all singers who are also great actors.  Every time we get caught up in the story and hope it might end differently &quot;this time.&quot;  I heartily recommend it as a first-time opera experience for anyone who wants to try it out.  It doesn't get much better than this.
B000002IV8|3.0|Around 1992, a disturbing trend hit the metal world. Inspired by grunge, and the death of the real Metallica, many great bands decided it was uncool to play guitar solos and more than one string on the guitar. Great bands have reduced themselves to playing one finger, one string grooves. This album is a prime example. Not a bad album, but this kind of playing has just become redundant. Skip this one and check out Horrorscope.
B000002BVN|4.0|Michael Jackson proves 'Perfect Jackson' and 'No Bad' with his masterpiece song sequences and message flow in this dazzling cover 'Blood on the Dance Floor' The song is a towering piece of music on the dance floor and grabs all 'five stars' in my list. Superfly sister has a message for anti sex for the girls and mj aims here to cool them off with a fiery tempo beats n lyrics. Earth song has ever been my fav and so exceptional, you are sure to feel the emotions bubbling up. Ghosts is another Jackson style, screaming out on top of his voice, though melodiously and its message adressing the media and all those who made a fool of him or mocked around. Great club dances with Dance remixes songs of History in the Mix are sure pick numbers to swing square n cool on dance floor, Mj's album is 'Must Pick' and a collector's Choice Pick. Michal Jackson is just flawless n the album is worth the money spent or rathar worth 'A Perfect Pick'
B00005JKJA|2.0|The only virtue that I can say that this movie has is that, unlike most movies, it leaves you wondering what the story is.  Therefore, it not just another movie in that respect.  In other words, if you think a plot that doesn't make sense makes a good movie, then this movie is for you.  I wouldn't rewatch it to understand the story better.
1577311523|4.0|A simple yet powerful message by Ekhart Tolle's - Live Now, live with the Present and you remain sailing on the sea of life. The author packs it with lots of infomation, messages floating with a clear, enthusiastic voice focusing on enlightened life, creativity and live genuinely in peace and happiness.It's a masterpiece of a new generation leaving behind the traumas of pain, suffering and adopting the method of staying 'afloat' n survive. The book has Eastern and Western spiritual teaching influence. Tolle believes in 'self', the true conscious living and not only believing in 'God'The Power of Now is living the 'Present' and accepting the 'I' as Arthur Deikman puts it, which is identical to awareness and one who is aware, Now is realised - So is this true. I recommend this book as a Spiritual self trainer to 'Let-go' off the pain n suffering and leave behind the scars to live in Present.
B00004S6GL|5.0|I might get flamed by some hardcore Elliott Smith fans for writing this review, so let me preface myself by saying this: I am also a hardcore Smith fan, and \\"Figure 8\\" is arguably the best out of his five studio efforts.  Some may say its tone is too upbeat or \\"pop,\\" others may say it is an irrevocable deviation from the downbeat, sometimes angry, always guitar-driven albums that came before it.  Indeed, the melancholy that characterized these older albums goes hand in hand with Smith's critical acclaim.  I think what people fail to see about \\"Figure 8\\" is that its \\"Smithlessness\\" is merely due to his adoption of a band that lends so much *musical* pleasure to most of the album's eighteen songs.  This does not detract from the emotional intensity of his songs; it only adds to it.<br />This is not to say Smith has totally abandoned his roots.  There are several quiet guitar songs on the album, and they prove themselves to be perfect counterpoints to the more instrumentally involved pieces.  All the songs flow together harmoniously, sometimes with the help of short interludes--a technique that had been previously unknown to his music.<br />It is hard to list highlights on an album that is filled with them.  \\"Somebody I Used to Know\\" resurrects McCartney and the Beatles and stirs into the concoction a bitter edge, resulting in a nose-thumbing of an ex (a common theme in Smith's songs, but unique every time).  His guitar and expressive voice work in tandem in the exquisite \\"Everything Reminds Me of Her\\" and \\"I'd Better Be Quiet Now;\\" the songs, both mellow and pensive and stunning in their sincerity, are Smith at his best.  A trademark self-deprecation is evident on \\"Stupidity Tries,\\" where, backed up by hard-rocking strings and electric guitar, he describes himself as \\"Another drunk conquistador / Conquering the governor's ball.\\"  \\"In the Lost and Found\\" is an unexpected pleasure, with a honky-tonk piano (played by the artist) that is coupled with a simple yet heartbreaking bridge.  &quot;Pretty Mary K&quot; borders on psychedelica, crashing toward its summit before its denouement lets the listener breathe.  The lushness of \\"Color Bars\\" is due in part to an arrangement that is nearly orchestral; similarly, \\"Don't Say a Word\\" is thrilling, made more so by a deafening guitar and Smith's words (the song's, as well as the album's, closing lyric inquires repeatedly, \\"Why would you want any other / When you're a world within a world?\\").  <br />So to all of the naysayers of \\"Figure 8,\\" I present the evidence that Elliott Smith has not lost the bite of his acutely personal songwriting.  He has merely presented it in a different form.  For the uninitiated listener, the selling point is that these songs are *impressive* and can be appreciated by anyone with an ear for a great voice, lyrics, and musical backup.  Isn't that reason enough to give it a listen?
B000002VQQ|5.0|Released alsmost 10 years before I was born. This LP must have been fresh at the time (and still is). This LP is indeed a must have in your cd collection. The 90s angry rock females wouldnt have existed without Patti Smith and this album shows it a mix of raw rock , 70s punk and late 60s rock (Jimi Hendrix, doors, velvet undground). This album stands out as one of the best albums by a female artist. She is angry And agressive. A woman who has a raw voice and guts to tell it like it is. For every music lover get a copy of this album. Cause this album is a gem and patti Smith rocks.
B00000DLUV|5.0|Although One, Closer Than Close, Still Waters, Morning of My Life, Run To Me, and Guilty are missing from this cd from the actual concert, it is still packed with favorites. Sit down at night or at anytime and enjoy classic hits like Stayin' Alive, To Love Somebody, How Can You Mend A Broken Heart, Lonely Days, or even cuts like Nights on Broadway or I Can't See Nobody. I reccommend buying the vhs instead because not only is it a video, but you also get 6 more great songs. But, this is still a great cd worth buying for any BeeGees fan!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Everything is not what it seems--right? Well, surely there are some exceptions. Comfortable middleclass white Anglo-Saxon Protestant suburban America, for instance. Well, let's zoom in on this nice representative street and test that hypothesis. Eddie Murphy and Wesley Snipes do not live in this neighbourhood. Their kids do not go to school with these kids. Surely, noone here is in Bruce Willis's Color Of Night psycho self-help group. Squad cars do not patrol this street. They and all other nasties and challenges to normalcy are out of sight beyond an invisible hermetic barrier.<br /><br />Sure enough, as we zoom in for a closer look, here is a nice normal couple, Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening). Lester is in advertising, and in mid-life crisis. Carolyn is a real estate agent dedicated to living by appearances, playing self-improvement tapes in the car, and swapping lifestyle and gardening tips with the homosexual couple next door. We know Lester and Carolyn once had sex, because they have an only child, Jane (Thora Birch). She hates her weird parents and wants only to live in a normal healthy environment like the Addams Family, or a remake of The Exorcist -- when she is not hanging out with her geek-next-door boyfriend.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the conjugally challenged, burnt-out Lester has the hots for his daughter's Lolita-esque best friend (Mena Suvari). Fantasies about her embellish his day.<br /><br />The climax of the film is a real surprise (which I won't spoil here). It occurs, ironically, at the moment of Lester's achievement of a level of serene enlightenment such as may be sought through lifetimes of effort by Hindu mystics.<br /><br />American Beauty is a very fine film of a script with quirky social insights, and first-rate acting, in a high quality DVD release.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie  was unique in the way it showed the Vietnam war. It showed our army was not a bunch of drugged up former criminals but in fact a very well trained fighting machine. Mel Gibson shines again with another flawless performance. The only so so parts of the movie were of the young Lieutenant he is played by someone with no acting ability what so ever I have only seen him in teen movies such as American pie and I think he must just be slow same dumb look in all his films.With that said the film was great.
B000002UA7|5.0|\\" The Whole Story \\" is a complication cd which contains eleven Kate Bush songs out of all of her recordings until 1987 and a new one , \\" Experiment IV \\" in which Kate talks about creating \\" a sound which could kill someone from a distance \\" which \\" could feel like falling in love \\" .<br />   From the witch-like rock of \\" Babooshka \\" to the dramatic sensational \\" Running Up That Hill \\" , Kate Bush has tried many different sound-styles in her career and managed to do equally well in all of them .  With the exception of \\" The Dreaming \\" , a complicated song from a generally experimental record which is here more for the fans , all the other tracks can easily charm the average listener even if he isn't familiar with Bush's work . <br />   Many have argued that there are other good songs that could have also been present here but this cd includes most of her  songs released as cd singles and usually , this is from what 'best of' complications are being made of . Surely Kate has released other great stuff as well but even so , this is certaintly a good way to get to know the artist if you haven't heard anything from her before . My personal favourite remains the moving \\" Cloudbusting \\" . Also make sure to purchase her following releases , 1989's \\" The Sensual World \\" and her farewell underrated offering \\" The Red Shoes \\" .
B00005KHJR|4.0|I have little to say about this delectable and intelligently written little horror/whodunit. Perhaps it is because I am disgruntled over the fact that I happened to know what a wicker man was prior to watching the film, thus spoiling the otherwise gripping climax. In spite of that, there is plenty here to entertain and compel, including superb performances (especially Chrisopher Lee), stylish direction, and clever dialogue. \\"Wicker Man\\" is nothing less than a burried treasure, and will be supremely enjoyable viewing if you are not cursed, as I was, with the knowledge of what a wicker man is. ENOUGH FEELING SORRY FOR MYSELF! The film is great, anyway.
B00005A1PR|5.0|i completely adore this album. i can not tell you how much i luv this album. it's that great. there is not one track on this album i do not like. the title says it all &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot;. if this is your style of music i seriously suggest you get this as soon as possible. you won't be disappointed. the lyrics are so honest &amp; simple. her voice &amp; the music is so beautiful. i wish i could truely explain how much i enjoy this album. though all the tracks are great,my favorites are &quot;Promise&quot;,&quot;Beautiful&quot;,&amp; &quot;Ready For Love&quot;. those 3 alone just make me go WOW &amp; the rest of the album is just as good. pretty amazing,especially since i wasn't planning on buying this record. i just happen not to be able to find the record i was looking for &amp; picked this up. i am very glad i didn't find that other record :). i am very much looking forward to her next record &quot;Voyage To India&quot;.
B0000648WZ|5.0|i thought that the adaptation for the time-period was nothing but a challenge.  interpreting the author is no small feat.  the values and vision the producers, script-writers, director(s)leadership, sprecial-effects (macyverism),..the many unmentioned participants including the hearts of the actors can bring to the viewing audience; a story that draws upon their own expectations.<br />true, that as of august 2002, many movies are filled with pizzazz; extraordinary camera techniques, seeminly an abundant budget and the extraordinary efforts a movie production puts into its baby (movie).  <br />i thought that this strived a bit from the novel, but the story and time-line had to be condensed..what can you do with a limited time?<br />certainly i am no expert, but i've waited for the dvd...it was worthy of the wait.<br />that's my critism, and i'm sticking to it.....<br />-thomas
0553579908|5.0|I am not going to give a plot summary, because there are any number of other reviewers who have done so and I cannot condense this large and intricate story any better than they have.  I normally am not a big fan of fantasy.  I reluctantly bought  A GAME OF THRONES because I was tired of all my friends telling me what a great book I was missing.<br />I was under the misapprehension when I pruchased volume one that the series was going to be a trilogy.  After getting hooked on volume two, I discovered there were going to be at least three and possibly five more volumes.  This is really upsetting.  About 20 years ago I got roped into reading Shadow of the Torturer by Gene Wolfe thinking it was a single novel.  It turned out to be a tetralogy that was so good that I was dying of impatience for each volume to come out.  The same thing is happening with this series.<br />A CLASH OF KINGS is one of those rare series novels where the second installment is superior to the first.  I do not know how many volumes Martin can keep me hooked, but he is going to get at least one more out of me which is one of the reasons I am upset,  volume three is not yet in PaperBack, and I am normally loathe to pay that much for a book.  I think I will have to.<br />One of the reasons the book is so good is that almost all of the main characters are finely drawn and most of the secondary characters are also well drawn.  <br />In the first novel, I found Sansa Stark, to be an insipid, prissy, little girl.  I really did not enjoy reading her sections at all.  Martin has her, and most of the other characters grow and learn.  Much to my amazement, by the end of this volume I was empathizing with her.<br />The same is true of her mother, Catelyn.  In volume one I found her cold and distant.  In this volume I came to a better understanding of her and had more sympathy for her.  <br />My favorite character in both books is Tyrion.  He is very reminiscent of Hugo's hunchback in that he is considered by most to be a monster because he is a dwarf.   Martin makes the same point Hugo did, that humanity has nothing to do with external appearances.  Tyrion is certainly the most interesting of all the characters.<br />My least favorite was Theon Greyjoy, who was a ward/hostage of the Starks in volume one.  I think Martin went a little too far in showing the weakness of his character early on to justify what happens later on.  It felt contrived to me. <br />My second least favorite was Daenerys, the Dragon Queen, mainly because I could not stop wincing every time she said, \\"Blood of my blood.\\"  Unfortunately, she said it too often.<br />I can go on and on about even the secondary characters.  Peter Baelish [Littlefinger] Varys, the eunuch, and Cersei, the Queen Mother were all wickedly enjoyable.<br />Sandor Clegane, the Hound, was all too brutally human.<br />Tyrion's quips and self mockery throughout the book are one of the reasons I kept reading it.  In one scene he intercepts a letter to Cersei, reads it and then delivers it to her.  Cersei, thinking herself to be in charge, asks why she did not get it first to which Tyrion replies, \\"What else is a Hand for, but to hand you things.\\"<br />Cersei is depraved but at times extremely funny.  While she constantly ridicules Sansa, the point of the ridicule is to show this naive little girl how to survive.<br />\\"Do you want to be loved, Sansa?\\"<br />\\"Everyone wants to be loved.\\"<br />\\"I see flowering hasn't made you and brighter,\\" said Cersei.  \\"Sansa, permit me to share a bit of womanly wisdom with you on this very special day.  Love is a poison.  A sweet poison, yes, but it will kill you all the same.\\"<br />Equally sharp and witty is Lady Olena. She is affectionately known as the queen of Thorns.  Of Renly the would be king, she says, \\"Gallant, yes, and charming, and very clean.  He knew how to dress, and he knew how to smile, and he knew how to bathe, and somehow he got the notion that this made him fit to be king.\\"<br />The prose and characterization are excellent.  The action was realistically portrayed.  Martin is masterful in depicting scenes that give insight and emotional impact.  To give two examples,<br />Arya gets captured and brutalized and realizes that she is not a \\"fierce little boy with a sword, but just a grey mouse of a girl with a pail.\\"<br />Or Varys for reasons he himself does not know, tells  Tyrion how he came to be castrated.<br />While not all the pieces have come together, the hints given throughout both books when finally understood give a richness and a texture to it, and in some way makes the magic more believable.<br />Fantasy normally does not suspend my disbelief.  These books are exceptions and exceptional.<br />At 900 plus pages, it cannot be called a quick read, but it moved along briskly.  I had quite a few very short nights and finished it in 4 days.  This happens to me rarely.
B000069CWE|5.0|this is a great cd- it is a great mix of rap/rock/and even some techno.  the best songs are crawling remix points of authority and pushing me away. i reccomend this cd to anyone who liked hybrid theory and likes hip/hop too.
0375704027|1.0|It's not &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; the story itself that I give 1 star to- it's the Jay Rubin translation.  Over a decade ago I bought the Alfred Birnbaum translation, and I find Birnbaum to be a far superior translator to Rubin.  Rubin's translation of certain sensual phrases from the Japanese turn into stale duds of sentences compared to Birnbaum's more heartfelt ones.  Moreover, Rubin deletes words, sentences and paragraphs as he feels fit- Birnbaum does not make as vast edits as Rubin does.  In this version of NW, Rubin writes that Murakami has approved this as the official translation.  I'm sorry to say that although Murakami is my favorite author in the whole world, I have heard him lecture and his spoken English is remarkably terrible- he may know how to translate written English to Japanese really well, but he could use to learn about translating from his native language to English.  I've rattled on long enough- but let it be said, Birnbaum's translation is far superior- and if you do not live in Japan, then go to your local Japanese bookstore in America like Kinokuniya or Asahiya and get it- leave this disgrace of a translation on the shelf.
B000002JS6|5.0|If any album on here deserves 5 stars, it's this one.  Blistering hard rock power from beginning to end, Back in Black sounds just as good today as it did 22 years ago upon its release.  There literally is not a bad track on the whole CD.  From Brian's shrieking vocals to Angus' furious riffs to the rhythm section's relentless thunder, this is essential music.  One of those rare albums you can never tire of.
B000066C87|4.0|After the intimate joy that was 'Short Cuts', Altman's previous sprawling movie treat, there are some surprises and some things that come as expected from 'Gosford Park'.  With a cast that is simply magnificent, although no doubt many non-British audiences will not know who several of the cast members are as several are mostly famed for theatre.  The basic premise has a group of people gathering at a stately home to observe a shooting party, with a line being clearly drawn between the well-to-do folk and those that serve on them.  However, as various plot threads begin unravelling a murder takes place that sends everything into freefall.<br />Altman is the kind of brave director that doesn't opt for the easy option of setting off all his fireworks in the first round.  Indeed, with such a huge cast (all of whom are impeccable) he manages to extract extraordinary depth and character from every single one so that we can really sympathise with them or detest them.  These aren't the usual cardboard movie characters but real human beings.  Of course, the cast itself is an enormous asset.  Dame Maggie Smith proves why she is such a legend with a glorious performance, although there's really nothing to fault with the cast.  It's an absolute delight to see Emily Watson, such a talented actress who was so spectacular in 'Hilary And Jackie' on top form as well as a hard-done-by servant.<br />Whilst it's all too easy to go over-the-top with describing all there is to admire about this film, it's probably worth remembering that if long period dramas aren't your thing then maybe you're best clear of this.  Still, this is a lot more accessible than 'Short Cuts' was (without disparaging either) and that certainly should help it gain an audience, something this accomplished and very adult piece of filmmaking surely deserves.
B00005JKCF|5.0|When I first went to see Spiderman, I felt a bit like a wannabe considering I had never once picked up a Spiderman comic (although I did watch the cartoons when I was little). As a Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings fan I was annoyed with the people going to see the movies without ever planning on reading the books. So I apologize to the comic book world for not reading the comics that inspired the film (they just aren't my thing) and I hope that they'll forgive me. I didn't know what to expect when I saw the movie, but I knew it looked interesting. After I saw it for the first time I was hooked, the action, the acting, the storyline, everything was thrilling and exciting. <br />For everyone who hasn't had much experience with the Spiderman world, the movie is about a slightly geeky teen named Peter Parker (played by the amazing Tobey Maguire) who can't seem to go through life without screwing up majorly. He's in love with a girl (played by Kristen Dunst who has thankfully moved on from her teen movie phase) but can barely talk to her. But his life changes forever when Peter gets bit by a radioactive spider (for all you non-comic book fans out there, trust me, it's not as weird as it sounds. It's interesting). At first the only real affect the spider bite has on him is it makes him sick, but the next day when he wakes up he's much different. He's faster, stronger, and he can do amazing things like climb up walls and shoot sticky and strong webs from his wrists. But unknown to Peter, he's not the only one going through such a transformation. His best friend Harry's father Norman Osborn (played by the amazing Willem Defoe) is watching as his company falls apart at the seams. The only way he can save it is to try the enhancing formula out of himself with disastrous results.<br />To say more could ruin the movie but let's just say it's great. Spiderman is filled with the perfect mix of nearly seamless CGI fueled action, a touching romance, and a wonderful family storyline. Spiderman is about finding confidence in yourself and doing the right thing no matter what the cost. I saw this movie 3 times in the theaters (including on opening weekend) and I can't wait until the DVD hits the stores. If your in the mood for something spectacular well I think you'll love this.
0767817664|4.0|I have a list for almost everything. Honestly. And one of those lists is entitled \\"My Favorite 80s Horror.\\" Fright Night holds its own spot in the top ten. Because of its wit, scares, and the little notice of slapstick humour towards old Drac flicks. <br /> William Ragsdale stars as Charley Brewster, a normal guy who spends some spare time trying to get his girlfriend Amy (Amanda Bearse) to put out. Unbeknownst to Charlie, his new next door neighbor is a vampire (Chris Sarandon). As the vampire - Jerry - closes in on his mom, Charley realizes he must stop the vampire at once. But that's not so easy. With the help of Amy, his friend Ed (hilarious Stephen Geoffreys), and creature feature host Peter Vincent (Roddy McDowell), he begins his attempt to rid of the creature of the night.<br /> Throughout the movies are great horror moments tied in with simple humour. Mostly the dorkyness of being a teenager, and trying to unveil a \\"supposed\\" vampire. Tom Holland's direction is pretty on, especially the whole alley scene and the showdown between Evil Ed and Peter Vincent. All of the actors put on believable performances. Stephen Geoffreys left behind a classic character in the horror genre.<br /> If a craving for good old 80s mainstream horror ever hits your system, be sure to pick up or buy (Although a sadly bare bones dvd, plus the trailer) Fright Night. Satisfaction guaranteed.

6304696515|4.0|Dangerous Liaisons is a story based on Chonderlos de Laclos' novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses from 1782, which is full of deceit and love.  Marquise de Merteuil's (Glenn Close) ex-husband is about to remarry the young virtuous C&eacute;cile de Volanges (Uma Thurman), who was brought up inside a convent. This irritates de Merteuil so she asks Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich), her ex-lover, if he can help stain de Volanges virtuous reputation before the marriage.  In addition, de Valmont is offered one last night together with de Merteuil.  The final product is a pretty good English speaking film experience.
6303407188|5.0|Yes, Eddie!<BR>Not only Burton's best yet, but one of the finest<BR>American films from the 90's -- or of any decade for that matter.<BR>Cleverly written, lovingly directed, stylishly shot, acted<BR>with empathy, scored and designed with tasteful camp, ED WOOD<BR>is a virtual paen to Hollywoodism (whatever the hell THAT is!).<br />Just Czapsky's cinematography or Shore's soundtrack alone are <BR>worthy of immense praise.  And Tim Burton hits all the right notes flawlessly (for a change). Definitely his Citizen Kane.<BR>Can't praise Depp and Lugosi enough, nor the editing, or....oh, hell!  If you have any affection for the 50s, or B-Movies, or Bela Lugosi (God rest his soul), or Maila Nurmi (yum-yum), or angora, or pulp American cinema - meaning REAL American movies - then you should be a fan of this movie, regardless of what you think of Ed Wood's stuff.<br />Last point.<BR>This movie is overdue for a worthy DVD treatment: docus, bios,<BR>making-of-background -- the whole bit.<BR>Was good enough for an Oscar for Landau, so why are we still waiting?<BR>Yes indeed, pull that (angora) string!
B00005JKGI|5.0|The Italians are so funny and the Brits are are driving around like mad men in their Austin Minis.<BR>What could be better?<br />Hang on mates, I've got an idea?????
B00003CXI1|5.0|Wow!  What a magical ride.  We have watched this DVD repeatedly and each time, I not only enjoy the cinematography, music, and  creativeness involved, but I see something that I didn't before.  Some little detail that enhances the overall experiance.  Can't wait for the next one.  <br />Recommended for Adults and Children!  How great is it that there is a movie that speaks to both groups.  The family can sit down together again, pass the popcorn, and bond!!<br />-Beth W.
B0000029DD|5.0|It's really, really hard to pin down why I like 'Grace' and Jeff Buckley so much. I guess to some degree it's the fact that he takes the rawness, unique songcraft and drama of Led Zeppelin and pens songs about sleeping on your ex-girlfriend's couch as opposed to songs about Tolkien characters.<br />You just listen to a song like \\"Mojo Pin\\" and you get it or you don't. It starts out with Gary Lucas' weird, subdued guitar loops, and then, from out of the darkness, *that voice* descends on you like a shroud. You don't even notice that the song follows the verse-chorus-verse pop formula because each time the chorus reappears, it's been transformed into something more and more abrasive. What starts out as a song of simple, wistful yearning, by the end has become a pounding death metal scream. Buckley twists Van Morrison into Slayer without making you think twice, and that's only the first track. <br />The thing that really gets me about Jeff Buckley is that he was a master of synaesthesia. He uses music to engage all of your other senses, creating a complete sensurround. Whether that's \\"Love, let me sleep tonight on your couch/I remember the smell and the fabric of your simple city dress\\" on the sparse and subdued (right up until the white noise freak-out) \\"So Real\\" or the rainy-day funeral vignette that opens up the acoustic guitar-led epic of regret \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" that morphs into a gospel R&B number. The grand, dark, Indian-flavoured \\"Dream Brother\\" opens with images of a \\"Dark angel ... with his black feather wings unfurled\\". I doubt many people have ever actually drank lilac wine, but after hearing Buckley's version of the song, you'll know exactly what it tastes like.<br />The maturity of Buckley's songs are striking. \\"Grace\\" is an acceptance of life's temporal nature disguised as a farewell to a lover. \\"Dream Brother\\" is a plea for responsibility on the part of a friend bent on abandoning his wife and child. \\"Last Goodbye\\" is an optimistic break-up song, which accepts the pain of a relationship's dissolution but is ultimately about the possibilities that such a situation opens up to one.<br />There's really nothing I can say about the cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Hallelujah\\" that hasn't been said before. It's a true masterpiece because Buckley communicates the power of the classical imagery with such force and sincerity.<br />The album's not without its small flaws. The anti-racism grunge number \\"Eternal Life\\" alone feels like a product of its time, something that Buckley realized, since his excellent live versions of the song were given a much harder, classic metal edge to them. \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" exists to bridge the mournful, beautiful \\"Lover...\\" and the hard-rocking \\"Eternal Life,\\" but to be honest, I've never listened to it to the whole way through. <br />It's an album that absolutely must be listened to in the dark. It's moody, beautiful, heartbreaking and rocking. There are a very few records that become an inseparable part of your life once you've heard them. 'Grace' is one of them.
1878424319|1.0|This book is bad news.  Not only has the author written this book on a 3rd. grade reading level, the book just goes on and on and on about essentially the same thing.  And his references to the Bible...I wonder if he has actually read the Bible because his interpretation is way off base.  This book is ridiculous .  Don't waste you time and money.
B00005JL3A|2.0|I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here except<BR>for some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film. <BR>All we hope for is some cool special effects and fight scenes But even on that level, \\"Resident Evil\\" is a disappointment. <BR>I do not think being a fan of the game could've possibly improved my enjoyment of this film.
B000002V0Q|5.0|This is the loudist heaviest cd that has ever been made or ever will. megadeth rules
B00005NW02|5.0|I actually heard System Of A Down on the Loud Rocks compilation Cd covering Wu- Tang Clan's \\"Wu-Tang Clan'Ain't Nuthin Ta ...With\\" and loved it! I purchased Toxicity and was floored! It's so melodic and playful but hard at the same time. The gems are Aerials, Toxicity, Prison Song,and Chop Suey; but the rest is solid as well. Go get it!
B00005JKZT|5.0|LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was a great movie. it takes a lot to impress me with the unoriginal dreck Hollywood crams out these days, but at least, in-between the Tomb Raiders and Planet of the Apes \\"re-imagening\\"s, films like The Lord of The Rings revamp my cinema-going enthusiasm. Ans it has now become one of my all-time favourite films. Considering that the entire trilogy was filmed as one big movie, the second instalment, THE TWO TOWERS, will continue continuity, with the masterful storytelling, great characters and breath-taking visuals seen in the first one. I can't wait.....
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica was one of the bands that got me listening to rock and roll as a young black kid in the late 80's and early 90's. During this time I would watch Yo MTV Raps and Headbanger's Ball on the same day and see Public Enemy, Slick Rick, Guns N Roses and Metallica. By far the best band of the 1980's, this album is the fourth(and unfoutunately the last) of their masterpiece albums; their political stances and superb musicianship drew me into them and got me wanting to play guitar and drums. I love Jamed Hetfield's voice and great penchant for writing lyrics that mean something. Even though they have fallen off HARD, listening to this brings back memories. Go get it!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Apart from Angelina's knockers, this film is a complete bore. Did anyone mention plot? Didn't think so. Did anyone mention acting? Nope. Did anyone mention good action? And that's the shocker of all shockers, they could of at least thrown in some cool action set-pieces, but what's on show here rarely passes mediocrity. Major dissapointment.
B000068TPN|1.0|This was by far the worst movie of the year(it's up there with Goldmember)  There was absolutely no heart to it.  The carnage did not make up for it.  I read the book before the movie and that [disappointed] too.  Moore is a conceited man who just got as far as he did by blind luck.  No amount of skill or experiance can help you avoid a bullet.  In the book he sounds like he is a superheroe or something talking like he's some kind of great leader of men.  Give me a break!  He also contradicts himself in the book twice.  I'm was in the military also, and when it comes to surviving, luck around shootings counts for alot more than people think.  Don't waste your time with this book or movie, just go back to the RAMBO and BRADDOCK trilogys.  There are more movies about Vietnam that are alot better than this one.  As far as \\"getting it right\\", of course galloway and moore are going to say that, it's from their book.  Wallace did an okay job and Gibson too, but don't give them too much credit.  \\"Murdoch, I'm coming to get you!\\"  That's a Vietnam flick!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Very good cd. I really like Avril Lavigne cause she is punk(which I love) and pop(which I like). My favorite song on the cd is \\"Sk8er Boi\\"(#3), I can sing that song anytime. But I really like \\"Moblie\\"(#5). It has a good beat and has catchy lyrics at the same time. My least favorite song has to be \\"Losing Grip\\"(#1)I really don't like the words or the beat, but it is still okay. I would actually give the CD 4.75 stars just because \\"Losing Grip\\", but Amazon won't let me. I think it's a very good CD and if you heard \\"Complicated\\"(#2) on the radio or T.V., you would like some of the other songs too.
0316666343|4.0|I absolutely loved this book.  After seeing it mentioned on The Today Show as a good summer read, I decided to pick it up.<BR>It's an interesting perspective, although it does jump around a bit.  Justice is served in the end, but not the way I was expecting.  In fact, it was almost disappointing until I truly thought about it...that the victim's family puts aside their desire for revenge, and moved on not knowing what fate came of the man who took their daughter from them...now that takes faith!
0553381709|5.0|This book was amzing. The best of the three so far. i have huge respect for Martin. The man has outstanding ability at manipulating his readers. For example in AGot I hated Jaime Lannister at the end of AsoS I was nearly in tears for him. Read this book you won't regret it.
B000067CPX|5.0|I may not have been born when the Red Hot Chili Peppers were really hard rock or great musicians but I enjoyed this cd enormously. Its got very easy songs to sing along with in the car and even my picky dad likes it. ...
