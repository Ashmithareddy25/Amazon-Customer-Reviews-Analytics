0446677450|5.0|Kiyosaki by now has reached a superstar notoriety few authors ever achieve. The reason for which is simple, the books he writes are valuable and of superb quality. The get rich fast genre of books has crescendoed in recent years. Most are unsubstantive and heavily rely on gimmicks and the business du jour to sell. Kiyosaki instead writes a book that encompasses all one NEEDS to know to change their thinking about money. Those who successfully can do it, can see huge changes. However, Kiyosaki notoriously leaves out specifics on achieving great wealth. The how (to become rich) according to him is not his job, but rather yours. Since there are myriad paths to riches, one method may not work for another. With plethora of reading material now available to become rich (some better than others) its your job to supplement your education, although he makes recommendations.       Kiyosaki insteads emphasizes one point on becoming rich, that is the main barrier to achieving wealth for most people...our thinking. Its not smarts, looks, talents, who-you-know or even what you know (although these attributes wouldnt hurt). You obviously need to be armed with the know how to start your path to riches. Instead, Kiyosaki emphasizes the methodology of thinking that must be overcome. A monumentous demand, to obliterate all our pre- conceived notions of money. But if you arent already rich and want to be, then its time for a change, right? He explains, the rich not only think differently about money from the rest of the oblivious masses...they think OPPOSITE! He also points how risky it is to continue to live a life of dependence on a job. A death trap to becoming rich. When one can fully realize the opportunities that abound all around us, can we thus mentally visualize the wealth that can be created. He uses the titanic pioneers of industry like Ford, Carnegie, Gates, Buffett to exemplify what he posits.     Kiyosaki explains the 2 trains of thoughts that compelled him to view twotremendously dichotomous paths: one of exorbitant riches (rich dad), the other of destitute despair (poor dad-his biological father). Most of us who read these books were also probably taught similarly to his own poor dad. Robert by imparting this wisdom from his rich dad, becomes in a way our own rich dad. This insight when fully inculcated and believed can become earth shattering and ever life changing.       In short, this book is cheap and its insight into the mind of a rich person can literally cause an epiphany, a starting point to obtaining wealth on a level only limited by our own imagination. Its wisdom is invaluable. Kiyosaki cleverly refrains from fully revealing all his rich secrets in one book, to have material for other books now available.      Those who fail to realize the opportunities all around us, or refuse to change their habitual thinking about money are probably doomed to misery and wont be worth the effort reading.
0689859414|5.0|My granddaughter is eleven and LOVES these books!  It's so much fun <br />to see her excited about reading. She spent hours pouring over this. <br />I bought her the Notebook for Fantastical Observations, too.  This <br />series is the best thing to happen to reading since Harry Potter.
0743289412|5.0|Lisey's Story will probably be viewed in years to come as one of King's most important books, if for no other reason than it is his most personal one.   King accomplishes this, interestingly, primarily through the memories and voice of  Lisey Landon, the wife of recently deceased literary icon.  Lisey is of course a fictional character, but it's not too far a stretch to see Lisey as something of a stand-in for King's own wife (and her sisters - as the author concedes in an endnote to the novel), and that the book operates at least on one level (and it has many levels) as a Valentine to his beloved.    As a result, Lisey's Story is being called by many a love story, with some elements of horror (or more accurately, dark fantasy).  And that is true, but I think King meant it to be something more than that.  Lisey's Story is also the author's meditation on Life, his life.   And under that umbrella you will find further meditations on the writing life, celebrityhood (and its dangers ), love, grief, and family.  King has called himself a Romantic, and Lisey's Story is an elaboration of that sentiment.      But King is also a Rebel, and for some time now King has been insisting that the walls between genre fiction and \\"serious fiction\\" are artificial, and that authors such as Elmore Leonard, Peter Straub, and others, be considered when it comes to the various book awards.  And I feel he has an argument.  Just look at Cormac McCarthy, the toast of the Literary Heavyweights, who has just penned a couple of genre-like efforts (the drug war holocaust, No Country for Old Men, and the end of the world cannibal-filled, The Road). To underscore this, King utilizes a modernist literary device - stream of consciousness - as Lisey relives her past with her husband Scott, in reveries that erupt, seamlessly, with the present.  I think King handles this very well, but it will not make for an easy read, at least initially.   But be patient.  The fantastic side of the story also mixes well.  In fact, King's deliberate pace seems to earn the appearance of Scott Landon's imaginative haven Booýa Moon (which reminded me, more than a bit, of Arthur Machen's nightmarish dreamscape in The White People).  By the time we as readers enter this sometime terrifying Eden, a context has been established, through character development, history, and context.  There is of course a thread of darkness throughout the novel, but ultimately Lisey's Story is about a life, filled with both light and dark, that is nevertheless a well-lived one.  I've been reading King since the late 70s (Salem's Lot being my first), and after all these years, he seems like an old friend.  With Lisey's Story, I can say quite comfortably: Well done, Old Friend.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I love Christmas in general. My Husband and I wed the week before Christmas and I walked down the aisle to a quiet instrumental version of Carol of the Bells. However, this album has made it's way into the #1 spot of our Christmas music. That's a hard thing to do as we love our Christmas music. Sarah's voice combined with classics brings a warmth so despearately needed in this season. This is one we won't soon cast aside.

B0000VCZKW|5.0|I purchase this DVD for my grandniece, and she absolutely loves it.  She watches it over and over again.  She knows every word verbatim.  I don't mind watching it. What a great movie!!
B00005JPC7|2.0|The premise for this film excited me; at first glance, I even thought it might have been a Charlie Kaufman screenplay. (No, turns out it's by a first-time screenwriter. Inspired by Charlie Kaufman, perhaps?) The trailer reassured me that there was hope for an original story and an enjoyable movie experience. I commented that the trap to avoid here would be the \\"hero discovers how meaningless his life is and undergoes a transformation into a new, more interesting person\\" cliche; if the filmmakers could avoid that and give us some original character development, we might just have a great film.<br /><br />I'm disappointed to report that they did not avoid that trap. True, the transformation wasn't quite as over-the-top as it is in some films, but it did rely heavily on ever-greater interaction with the love interest, a more casual wardrobe, a hip song performance, and a handful of other overused vehicles that scream \\"Look at me! I'm a character with an ARC!\\"<br /><br />Beyond that, the characters lacked the kind of likeability it usually takes to rally the audience behind their development anyway. When the success of a story hinges on the audience caring about whether the hero lives or dies, the audience had better want him to live. Instead, I felt resigned to the idea that he might die and idly interested in what might happen next. In other words, the filmmakers never really reached me.<br /><br />The dryness of the humor, the attempts at stylish special effects, the offbeat nature of the story, the pacing of it all -- these are all hallmarks of films I love and should have been an easy \\"in\\" for the filmmakers with a viewer like me. Instead, I found myself bored by the cloying attempts to merely imitate great films rather than to invent something truly new and original.<br /><br />For example, the side plot involving Emma Thompson as the novelist and Queen Latifah as her seen-it-all assistant sent by the publisher was as tired as it was tiresome. Emma Thompson was, as usual, more than competent in her role, but to what end? Even she couldn't elevate the quality of this effort.<br /><br />And however refreshing it should have been to see Will Ferrell take on a role with more substance than he had to work with in, say, Anchorman or Bewitched, the material here too often gave him miserably little to work with. The audience is left watching Ferrell brush his teeth while we have the nagging sense it's supposed to be funny.<br /><br />It should be noted that I saw this film in a theater that must have been full of forgiving Ferrell fans, because there were titters at many of these awkward, un-funny, mundane scenes. If you're a diehard Ferrell fan, maybe it's worth the price of admission to laugh at Ferrell as he ties his necktie and brushes his teeth. If you're a more casual fan of Ferrell's, you might want to wait and rent this one. And if you're Ferrell-ambivalent, give this a miss.mpson was, as usual, more than competent in her role, but to what end?

B0006A9FKA|4.0|\\"Shaun\\" is supposed to be a comedic 'spoof' and a 'homage' to \\"The Zombie Movie\\".  It accomplished that and more.  While the comedy is wryly British, it is still funny - and the social comment is Universal to civilized society (in cased you missed it - we're all zombies already).<br /><br />Just a fun movie, from start to finish - BE WARNED there are the gratuitous 'gore' scenes necessary for it to BE a Zombie film, but they are few, fast and over.  There is a lot of 'quick-wit' humor - The Newscaster's comments  at the end, \\"I never thought I'd say...\\" as an example.<br /><br />Strip away the humor and homage, and there is actually a much tighter plot than many movies.  There are not many loose threads - \\"How did the zombie get in?\\" - go back three scenes and oh, Ed habitually leaves the front door open...  Impressed by the attention to those kind of details.<br /><br />It's billed as a \\"Romantic Comedy with Zombies\\" - and it delivers.
1577314808|5.0|A book full of deep insight and potential for revolutionary change both in my life and the world.  I found it helpful to reread the book several times, absorbing more each time.
B00005JPC7|5.0|Will Ferrell usually the star of slapstick comedies stars in a different comedy or is it a tragegy? The story of Harold Crick, an IRS agent who hears a woman's narration that revolves around what he does in life & that only he can hear. Dustin Hoffmann, Maggie Gllyenhall, Queen Latifah, Emma Thompson & Tom Hulce star in this light hearted comedy about reality & literature crossing over. An marvelous interesting film, a fantastic litetary mystery, a masterpiece, Will Ferrell does it again. Go see it!
B000059TEP|5.0|A friend of mine reccommended this movie to me after watching \\"Just Like Heaven\\", so I got the DVD and watched it.  After all these times I've watched this, I can never get past the part where Sam  and Molly are dancing to \\"Unchained Melody\\" at the end without sobbing.  Everyone should see this movie before they die ;).
B000GFLKF8|3.0|All the criticisms of the film made by others are quite valid. I still think the film holds up well on several fronts.<br /><br />1 -- The robber-in-chief is brighter and more idiosyncratic than the typical thriller villain.<br /><br />2 -- Jodie Foster's character, with her edgy qualities, is a real departure and a welcome change for this talented actress (even if the script leaves her a bit ineffective).<br /><br />3 -- The hostage situation is so unusual it keeps the viewer guessing as to what could possibly be going on.<br /><br />This may not make the AFI Top 100 Films of all time but it is a perfectly good DVD to rent for a Friday night at home. It's a rare B movie that I would actually happily watch twice.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I don't have the eloquence or the store of superlatives in my vocabulary to properly describe this deeply satisfying CD.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it is \\"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\\" (one of the titles), but it is as good a collection of songs as I've heard in many a moon.  Knopfler's and Harris's voices blend beautifully and effortlessly.  The songwriting is sublime; there's not a weak offering in the mix.  \\"Love and Happiness\\" may be the best song Emmylou has ever written (co-written with Kimmie Rhodes).  The title song perfectly captures the reflective, somewhat elegiac tone of the album; it is an instant classic.  I can't imagine this CD not winning a Grammy.  If you've been hesitating about getting it, hesitate no more.  You'll feel like you've \\"dug up a diamond, rare and fine.\\"
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I rarely like live albums, but this one is excellent. But too bad it's not the complete set. Anxious for the DVD!
0440419514|3.0|Like another of the reviewers here, I really enjoyed the first book \\"The Golden Compass\\" when it came out here in the States. It was several years before I read the other two. I was really disappointed. Interwoven with some wonderfully clever ideas and interesting characters, the author ends up, after all the adventures and losses and deaths of most of the major characters with the stupidest ending. The two young people end up where they started--in many ways worse off than when the began. I was left asking: \\"What was the point? What was all of this FOR???\\" I was, frankly, angry before I reached the end, but stuck it out. I wanted my money back.
0373771665|3.0|This is no critisicm of Heyer's writing which is just delightful and a significant influence on many current writers across genres.  However the copy editing on the HQN editions is so bad that some sections are just unreadable.  I was thrilled to see that these classic novels were being reprinted and tried three different titles hoping that I'd just hit a bad exception but in all three of them there were so many misspellings, transpositions, sentences missing or displaced that in places it became a real jigsaw puzzle to try to reconstruct a sensible paragraph out of the gibberish.  If anyone reading this review knows someone at the publisher please, please, ask them to hire a competent copy editor for this series!!

B000301YY8|5.0|Outstanding album -- lyrics, music, performance.  Creative departure from the current \\"musical\\" efforts prevalent today.
B00005JPBP|3.0|For a movie about murder, revenge, and obsession, The Prestige is remarkably passionless. With thin characters and a thick plot, that's hardly surprising. But the cold core of The Prestige is chilled further by a story that is so mechanistic, so structured like Lego® blocks, and so populated with intellectually interesting, but unsatisfying diversions, that it simply never rises above being a series of pretty pictures and rookie chess moves.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing? To a degree. The story line is sufficiently interesting, if improbable and ultimately unsatisfying, to be a pleasant enough diversion. Despite being given so little to work with, Jackman and Bale draw you in with charisma alone, and it's nice to see Michael Caine. Scarlett Johansson, who I love, is weak, but looks great.
B000HIVO64|4.0|Beck might be the coolest and greatest creative musical genius of our generation. What's so cool about Beck is that his music is always different and interesting and so hard to pinpoint. It's rock, alternative, folk, hip-hop, jazz, lo-fi and so many other things with lyrics that make no sense but are just awesome. He travels through so many musical dimensions. Sometimes his music is serious and heartfelt (i.e. his 2002 album \\"Sea Change\\"), other times it's crazy and strange (i.e. his 1994 album \\"Stereopathic Soulmanure\\"). His new album \\"The Information\\" has a little of everything. Since Beck's breakthrough in 1994 with his hit single \\"Loser\\" and creating an amazing (major label) sophomore album \\"Odelay\\" (with his other radio staple \\"Where it's At (I got two turntables and a microphone)\\", a new Beck album is always something to look forward to. And \\"The Information\\" is definitely worth the wait I've been craving. It might not be his best album (\\"Odelay\\" will probably never be topped, (although some fans agree 2005's \\"Guero\\" is a close second)). But it is definitely an album which will spin my head for a month or two. Something very creative and cool about this CD is what it comes with. The album comes with 2 discs, one is a CD that has all the tracks on it and the other is a DVD with all the tracks which all have music videos. Although, all the videos are alike (basically Beck and bunch of people he knows (his son, wife, friends etc.) are behind a green screen with different effects). The CD also comes with a customizable album cover. Each CD has a set of stickers, you can place anywhere you want on the CD booklet which is a blank canvas. As for the music, most of the songs are a bit slow but all have a cool groove to them especially \\"Think I'm in Love,\\" Strange Apparation,\\" \\"Solider Jane,\\" \\"Nausea,\\" \\"We Dance Alone,\\" and \\"The Information\\" . The 15 track hour long album has a vive most people can never get into, unless you're a Beck fan. Beck isn't an artist everyonecan relate to (except for some of his hit singles (i.e. \\"Loser\\", \\"Where It's At\\", \\"E-pro\\") but for that small percentage of people in the world who love Beck, this album will groove your mind. There are a lot of weird but very cool little things throughout the album that only Beck would think of to include in his music. For example, in \\"Cellphone's dead\\", the chorus has Beck singing then you hear someone who sounds like a 12 year kid sing \\"One by one I'll knock you out.\\" And of course, the lyrics are crazy but genius i.e. \\"No Complaints/But I wish I had my top of my brain/I'd like to walk/but the sun doesn't know we're awake). A lot of the tracks have a Mellow Goldness (Beck's debut album) to them. Others resemble Midnight Vultures (his 1999 album). And some tracks are like something Beck's never released before. There's two tracks that really stand out above the rest, track 2 \\"Think I'm in love\\" and his current single \\"Nausea.\\"
B000H7JCG4|3.0|I have been waiting for Beverly Hills 90210 to come out on DVD for so long.  I put in my Amazon pre-order the first day it was available.  I was always aware that some of the original music wouldn't make it onto the discs, but I had no idea just how little would make it.  While I'm loving re-living 90210, the music they've input over the original sounds is AWFUL.  It completely takes you out of the early 90s setting of the show.  Sometimes it downright changes the mood of scenes.  I remember so well that SoHo's Hippychick was playing in the club where Brandon finds his visiting girlfriend Cheryl dancing with Dylan.  On the DVD, however, they've replaced this track with some nondescript song with lame beats.  The scene goes from being tension-filled and kind of steamy with the original sounds, to truly bland with the replacements. <br /> <br />I'm still glad I bought the DVD set because it brings me back to a different time, but it isn't the same.  I don't know if the distributors continue trying to negotiate the rights to songs in the hope of releasing Season 1 as a set faithful to the original, but I hope they do.  I, for one, would buy Season 1 all over again.  And I wish I understood more about how these music rights negotiations work.  I would think the record labels or artists would want their music used.  It would give them far more exposure than the songs featured in 90210 probably get these days.  After all, when was the last time you heard Hippychick?

I would describe it as a well done comparative, rational and step by step analysis, with useful summaries at the end of each chapter. In addition there are plenty of insightful quotes from people. <br /> <br />It is a nice tool for reflection too for anyone involved in a managerial position of some relevance, be it in a large corporation or a family business like it is my case.  <br /> <br />
0307237699|5.0|It's true as some reviewers point out that Obama offers little or no specific answers, but he also states early on that it is not the purpose of the book. The purpose is more to express his hopes for a number of areas many have given up on as hopeless. In this respect, the book is very inspirational, and he also does share some general rough ideas of what he thinks may be some solutions. <br /> <br />I come from a more conservative view, and Obama presents himself as one who can be reasoned with - and that's not meaning for him to compromise his core values, just that he seems more open to hear, understand and maybe craft decisions that are effective yet do no grievious harm to any group of people. The best way I can express this briefly is that if he consistently continues to live out the values he expresses here during his time as a Senator, I would vote for him over any other likely candidate regardless of party. <br /> <br />His views and writing are a breath of fresh air compared with other current political writings. I wouldn't agree with all of his positions, but at least he can see both sides of the issues both intelligentally and empathetically toward the people affected by those issues. Like other reviewers, I would like to see what he would present for more developed specific answers for issues, how to pay for them, etc. Also like some other reviewers it strikes me that he may be better seasoned for a 2012 run (here we're all assuming that he's running for President, lol), yet his popularity may only remain strong for a 2008 run. I lean towards Obama going for VP in 2008, then all the marbles in 2012.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah Jones is O.K.  I think she has pretty nice hair and great eyeliner going on. Her music is OK too-sometimes I roll my car window down and listen to her voice when I am alone and sigh out loud on a Fall day, my hands languorously hanging out the car window. <br />However, Norah is just Norah.  She has a voice lacking any history, dirt, or pain.  I don't get the edge, I don't hear any knowledge of dirty martinis, swaying sequins, or too many sweaty bodies crammed in a smoke filled club.  I like jazz-but I like jazz for the dirty history it tells.  I like hearing the dry voices sing in desperation for an audience to listen and commiserate.  I like the sound of a few missed notes because the singer is staring up to the sky wishing they were someone else.  Norah's voice gives the impression of being old and having that special \\"twang\\", however, upon a few listening-it really has nothing.  It's just a nineteen-year old girl in a music studio, wearing a set of headphones, and someone is shouting, \\"Again Norah!, we some more emphasis on Shoot the Moon!-make it sound sexy honey, think SULTRY\\".... <br />Does Norah know what she is singing about-most likely, not a clue.  She may help pen a few words here and there on the album, but Norah with her perfect wavy hair and perfect skin has no clue what the meaning of jazz is.  For now, I'll be happy that she doesn't-I wouldn't want her to tarnish her sweet image.  Fun music for a teenager wanting something different-boring for someone wanting something with a bit of history to a voice, and looking for music that comes with a past.   <br />
B000I5X81K|5.0|I don't think I can adequately describe how amazing this CD is!  I love every song on it and I keep listening to them over and over! I don't have a favorite song, it's whatever song I am listening to at the moment. My husband wasn't a huge fan before, but he actually took my CD to work and came home saying \\"Wow, This is gonna be huge!\\" Good thing I bought a few copies!  He loved \\"Weeping\\", \\"February Song\\", \\"In Her Eyes\\", and \\"Machine\\" the best. I just held up the phone for my sister to hear the \\"romeo and juliet\\" theme, when I came back on, she was crying her eyes out! She ran right out and bought this CD, too!  I think Josh has done the music that HE wants to, because you can hear the deep intention of every song! I love that he has challenged himself and done what he loves, because we love it, too!

B000I5X81A|4.0|Back in 2000, there was collation of epic proportions, in one corner you had the greatest blues player ever to pick up a guitar, in the other was the greatest rock guitarist ever. And in a dream made in music history, the two greats decided to team up for an album Riding with the King. Those two were of course B.B. King and Eric Clapton. The album was a classic in its own right and the only complaint anyone could have was that they didn't do it earlier or more often. Well Clapton is back at it again, this time with another hero of his, J.J. Cale. <br /> <br />Cale may not be the household name that Clapton is but you have undoubtedly have heard his songs before including a couple of Clapton's biggest hits, Cocaine and After Midnight. One of the reasons Clapton reached out to Cale to make a record together is that he has for a while tried to make a Cale sounding album but could never get it right so the best way to accomplish that feat would bring in the man himself which culminated in the album The Road to Escondito. And the session musicians the pair brought in to help them are no slouches which including Steve Jordon, Pino Palladino, Derek Trucks, Taj Mahal, and John Mayer and also featured the last songs Billy Preston ever played on. <br /> <br />Cale naturally took over most of the writing for the session writing all but three of the tracks. Clapton then had credits of two of the song, one of which, Hard to Thrill, he co-wrote with Mayer that turned out to be the albums most bluesy song. The rest of the songs are harder to pin down as they blend folk, blues, country, bluegrass, and rock but never focus on a specific genre for any given song. The duo even get political on When the War Is Over where the sing that even if we bring the boys home that still doesn't help the ones already dead from the war. <br /> <br />The pairing on the album also seems to help Clapton. On his last couple albums it sounded as if he was struggling with being the guitar god he once wasand the elder statesman he was becoming now that he's in his sixth decade. With King Cale's guidance and more laid back approach to music, maybe Clapton' next solo outing will finally make that transition complete.

0743298020|3.0|Story line -  Highly popular, but secretive author hires unknown proprietor of a used book store to write her bio. The book's title comes from the author never having published a much awaited Thirteenth Tale in one of her series.  World wants to know why.  <br /> <br />If you are one of those who enjoy well written British novels with typical British period characters who in spite of whatever is happenning speak eloquently, then you may really enjoy this novel.  One of the main characters even works in a rare book store.  I mean, how much more bibliophic can you get. <br /> <br />However, be prepared. I found the story to start off strong and then to run down hill.  The plot becomes less and less intriguing as the story moves along.  There is a twist at the end, but it isn't worth the long struggle to get there.  Skimming may be in order. <br /> <br />Since much of this book revolves around twins, if you are a twin, it may be of more interest to you. <br /> <br />My recommendation - lukewarm at best.   <br />

0618680004|2.0|<br />Dawkins's latest offering is a 375-pp. diatribe against what he considers \\"the root of all evil\\"; namely: Religious Faith, Tradition, organized church hierarchy, etc., etc. <br /> <br />THE GOD DELUSION reads breathlessly, perhaps because it was written breathlessly. Dawkins is busy expounding his own scientific dogma here; traditional research techniques and literary style are thrown out of the window. <br /> <br />After everything else is said and done, the fact remains: THE GOD DELUSION is just not a very well-written book. Dawkins provides footnotes and cites sources whenever he deems fit; but many of his so-called conclusions about religion and religious faith are hasty, hazy, and entirely self-serving. Of course a scientist would argue against fundamentalism that violates the sacred separation between religion and natural science, of course! For the same exact reason, Christian Evangelicals write and publish THEIR own books, explaining why their point of view, of all the others, is the right one. <br /> <br />In these grand ideological battles between two equally intolerant approaches to the mystery of human existence, common bystanders find themselves drawn into the dispute: average people like you and me, who are equally open to both science AND religion (why must one always exclude the other?), who have their own privately held and cherished system of beliefs but who also understand the importance of science in our lives, which provides us with so many benefits that we, at least in this country, have become used to taking for granted. <br /> <br />Dawkins is waging his own little war against what he considers reactionary Christianity (although he criticizes Judaism and Islam too), and I am with him on this one. Intolerant religions that foster a distinct in-group morality are absolutely perverse, and need to be dealt with. But in his eagerness to destroy ALL things religious, Dawkins commits a number of blunders. <br /> <br />His first monstrously erroneous assumption comes fairly early on in the book, when he (somewhat smugly) makes a bold claim that if it weren't for religion, the World Trade Center wouldn't have been bombed. Oh, Richard, Richard, do you really think it is as simple as that? Religious differences notwithstanding, there will still be political differences, and social differences (between classes; after all, not all of us can be rich), and ideological differences (environmentalists vs. nature-destroyers), and economic differences (capitalists vs. Communists vs. anarchists), etc., etc. People will continue to disagree and bomb buildings and kill each other even without religion. That religion DOES fuel many of these conflicts is a regrettable fact which must be dealt with, but why single out religion as the scapegoat of all evil? Why not politics, or economy, or social differences? Or are those on Dawkins's list too? <br /> <br />What Dawkins is eager to establish is conformity. Time and again, he claims that religion tends to obfuscate and indoctrinate children (and a lot of the time it DOES!), but so do many other things. Dawkins invites his readers to \\"think for themselves,\\" but the proper reading of that would be, \\"Think for yourself, but ONLY as long as you don't drag religion into it.\\" <br /> <br />Most human conflicts, according to Dawkins, are caused by religion. Once upon a time this might have been true (and even now, in certain parts of the world), but the biggest loss of human life in the last century was caused by politics (WWI, WW2, The Vietnam War, etc.) and not by religion. Does Dawkins forget that it was science that eagerly provided the German government with poison gas during the First World War? (Incidentally, poison gas was first developed by Fritz Haber, a Jewish chemist whose eventual \\"reward\\" for his scientific contribution to the Fatherland was his exile from Germany by the Nazis). Does Dawkins forget that it is science that provides soldiers and generals with the latestequipment to annihilate \\"enemies\\" and opponents? Rather conveniently, Dawkins overlooks all this. Why? Because, quite obviously, anything and everything under the sun can be perverted out of all recognition and made into something else, and religion and science are no exceptions. But while Dawkins is more than happy to pour mud all over religion, his precious science is off limits to criticism. <br /> <br />The way I see it is: if something causes a rift and a major loss of life (whether animal or human), it needs to be examined and dealt with. If it's religion, so be it, let's criticize religion. But don't ever tell me that science is above criticism. The primary reason for the various experiments carried out in Nazi death-camps was not religion, but science. On the other hand, my own religion (Roman Catholicism) is responsible for book-burning, the Inquisition, and destruction of MILLIONS of people throughout the two thousand years of European history under Christian domination. I acknowledge and LOATHE what the Church did. But in his book Dawkins is being dishonest, and if there's anything I loathe even more than open aggression, it is dishonesty. He presents science as the best and highest of ideals; essentially, what we should all strive for. (Yeah, let us all become scientists, wouldn't that be a blast!). He completely disregards the \\"evil\\" side of science (once again, anything can be perverted and misrepresented to advance somebody else's agenda). <br /> <br />Dawkins's own agenda in this book is destruction of all forms of religious faith. His reason? Religion doesn't make sense, there's no ultimate scientific proof of God's existence, religion has caused much grief and sorrow to humanity; therefore, let us be done with it. Well, a couple of centuries ago, doctors bled their patients to death in the belief that sickness was caused by an overabundance of \\"humors.\\" The belief was widely held and widely practiced in the 19th century European medical community.Today we look back upon it (just like we look back on the Inquisition) as sheer barbarity. In a few more years, perhaps physicists will discover a new component to the atom. What will Dawkins say then? <br /> <br />My point is: science is as uncertain and prone to corruption and error as religion is. What sets a truly independent thinking human being apart from all others is not his hostility toward religion or science or both, but his/her determination to differentiate between what is right and what is wrong, regardless of what is being discussed. <br /> <br />Contrary to what Dawkins thinks, most religious people I know are not hostile to the idea of evolution and natural selection. Why? Because it makes sense. Only the literalists will deal in absolutes, and will continue to claim that the universe was really created in seven days. But I digress. <br /> <br />After reading THE GOD DELUSION it became clear to me that Dawkins, too, is not above reproach. He picks a convenient discourse, and he sticks to it. He gives you the full list of all the evils that organized religion is responsible for, without presenting you with the other side of the problem. That religion (especially Christianity) was also responsible for a lot of good does not even cross Dawkins's mind (at least he chooses NOT to mention it in this book). Science, on the other hand, is exulted and praised to the skies. The excesses of science are hardly mentioned, and why would they be? The author is trying to convince you that his way of doing and seeing things is PERFECT; he's not going to undermine his own claim by rummaging through his own dirty laundry; after all, he's not stupid. But it is exactly this kind of intellectual dishonesty that throws into question Dawkins's moral intentions. If you're only going to tell me half the truth, don't present yourself as an oracle. <br /> <br />The book does have many fine passages that raise interesting questions and is definitely worth a read, but it won'tbe something you will return to, again and again, throughout your life. It is simply too acidic and too hostile for that.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Wow what an amazing collection.  The first two movies are definately amoung some of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  The third and forth are lacking a little bit, but for the price, this collection is a MUST BUY!!!!
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Somehow, I never bought this when it first came out in 1977 - even though I am a rock music fan and live 45 mins. from Boston.  If you grew up during the 70's and listened to rock radio you already know all of these songs.  Every tune is a classic and the remastering is excellent.  I'm glad I finally have this on remastered CD format.  Somehow, these songs sound organic - - a great feat since so much studio trickery was used to create this recording.  A must have for any classic rock fan - young or old.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|This Cd is one of the best Dylan recordings in a very long time.  It is so smooth, not a moment of hesitation both in the His songwriting is better than ever and so attuned to the subject matter and the times he is writing about.  He gets his messages across (whether about lost love or Hurricane Katrina) with the band \\"spinning and crackling\\" in the background.  Bobby, you are truly \\"back\\"!....this adds to my lifetime of admiration for you - Simply Reyna
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away has become one of my all-time favorite films.  Every time I watch it I take away something new.  I'm sure there are tons of reviews on here describing it in amazing detail, but I just wanted to get my 5 stars into the vote.  Watch it!
B00080ZG10|5.0|'The Aviator' is a sweeping epic of a movie chronicling the earlier years of multi-millionaire and aviation genius Howard Hughes.  Hughes was more than just a simply playboy millionaire, he was a risk-taker and a brilliantly gifted mind, but also a soul tortured by Obsessive-Compulsive disorders.<br /><br />The movie starts with Hughes's movie project, 'Hell's Angel's', the most expensive movie of its time.  Hughes was into the movie business along with the aircraft business, which would explain his affairs with the hottest leading women of the time, Katherine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and Jean Harlow.  But Howard couldn't hang onto women, he wasn't just a A Type personality, he was A++++ Type.<br /><br />Hughes was both a dreamer and a mover-and-shaker.  The movie follows his life from his days producing movies to his contracts with the government for Constellation aircraft, his tragic crash, and the building and first flight of the Hercules (the infamous Spruce Goose).  There wasn't anything that could stop Howard Hughes except his own disorders, OCD's that he frequently succumbed to and suffered from.<br /><br />While many have mentioned the length of the movie, 170 minutes, time flew by for me as I watched it.  'The Aviator' doesn't have the feel of a long movie because I found it so interesting.  There are no lags or drags in the storyline.<br /><br />Worthy of mention is the absolutely spectacular performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes.  His performance is on the money and down to a T.  The casting is superb, with Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale as Ava Gardner, Alan Alda as Senator Ralph Owen Brewster, Ian Holm as Professor Fitz, Alec Baldwin as Juan Trippe, William Dafoe as Roland Sweet, Brent Spiner as Robert Gross, Jude Law as Errol Flynn, and Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow.  Topping off the star-studded cast is director and epic film master Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />The only downside would be a couple of editing mistakes and the fact that I could have watched more.  A short piece on his tragic ending would have been a better follow up than ending the movie the way it did.  'The Aviator' is an interesting and beautiful journey through the triumphant and troubled life of one of America's most romantic figures.  Don't miss the extras on the second CD, which hold a great deal of information on the real Howard Hughes.  The two CD set is worth every penny.  Enjoy!s and the fact that I could have watched more.

080701429X|4.0|This is a lovely book.  The ideas are innovative & thought provoking and probably worthy of 5 stars.  But I think Frankl would respect reviewers who don't give him 5 stars because he is not intent on getting everyone to believe in one set of ideas or one way of interpreting the world.  He wants each person to consider creating their own philosophies and meanings.  He was not primarily a student of one previously existing psychological discipline;  instead, he set out to take the best parts of the ideas he learned and observed, and he created his own psychological theories.  This book is worth consideration, even if you find yourself disagreeing with him regularly.  I encourage you to make your own evauations of the things he has to say.<br /><br />I disagree with his position that happiness and success \\"cannot be pursued\\";  especially given that his Logotherapy is \\"not pessimistic but rather activistic.\\"  In the same way that his Logotherapy does not consider the \\"will to meaning\\" as a secondary drive to either the will to power or pleasure, I do not consider the will to happiness or will to success to be secondary or passive byproducts to other \\"primary\\" pursuits.  He asserts happiness & success only ensue \\"as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself.  Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success:  you have to let it happen by not caring about it . . . success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.\\"  I respectfully disagree.  When I read this, alarms go off in my head, like when I hear that G n' R song that suggests \\"patience\\" is the solution to whatever the problem was.  Or when I hear people say, \\"There's nothing anyone can do, so just give it to God.\\"  Or \\"That's just the way it is and some things will never change.\\"  Oh, don't you believe them.  As Frankl may tell you in his recounting of the vacuum of morality & humanity in the concentration camps - when God doesn't address problems in a healthy, ethical or timely manner, sometimes the existential response is to ask God to give the problems back to you so you can try to fix them sooner.<br /><br />Another criticism of his happiness and success theories is that they seem to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Yes, he doesn't believe the self interested drives to power and pleasure are dominant or primary.  But he goes further to suggest that happiness & success are primarily achieved through \\"surrender\\" to another person or external cause.  Yes, Freudian psychoanalysis can lead to neuroses by focusing too much on oneself.  But I think better therapeutic solutions are found by giving value and acknowledgement to BOTH self interests AND the interests of others.  To exclude either can lead to dishonest, inconsiderate, or harmful results.  Frankl sometimes frames options as needing to choose one OR the other (too often mutually exclusive), and I think he does not consider the option of doing BOTH at key times.  Also, he sometimes concedes to an acceptance of suffering more often than I would encourage.<br /><br />I agree with Frankl that we are not only defined by the circumstances that occur to us.  We are defined by how we interpret them and how we respond to them.  Whether a person believes in Logotherapy or any other therapy, I think Frankl, in his examples of his therapeutic work with patients, does a good job of getting across the concept that positive changes can occur when people consider alternate ways of perceiving the actions and behaviors happening around them, and consider new ways of responding to them.<br /><br />Any therapy can be tough, because most therapeutic processes involve losses of pride.  They often involve a person making concessions - concessions about their long held, immutable or fundamental core defining beliefs and perspectives.  They often involve considering foreign, and previously personally taboo perspectives.  And it takes powerful forces sometimes to get some people to consider making such hard concessions - forces such as:  potentially losing a loved one, or losing both the House & the Senate and realizing different \\"mighty mandates\\" are in town.  (Thank God for democracy and free speech because even when they don't always lead to better policies, they at least promote change.)<br /><br />The Nazis believed that not everyone can or should be allowed to succeed because of their race, religion, status, or philosophies.  Frankl's response to the cruel world the Nazis created was to suggest that each individual should be judged by the conduct of their character - by how they responded each day to each hand they were dealt.  \\"Former prisoners, when writing or relating their experiences, agree that the most depressing influence of all was that a prisoner could not know how long his term of imprisonment would be. He had been given no date for his release.\\"  Yet each day, prisoners like Frankl chose to respond in the best ways they could under the circumstances.  I don't think Frankl wrote primarily because he wanted to become your therapist.  I think he wrote to inspire each individual to become so well read and diversely read on religion, ethics, and psychological theories that they become one of their own best therapists.  And I thank him for his contributions to encourage each of us in that pursuit.<br /><br />I started this review by mentioning Frankl set out to take the best parts of the ideas he learned and observed, and he created his own psychological theories.  And I finish this review by thanking an old friend, a woman who chose to fight me tooth and nail to encourage me to start to do the same.takes powerful forces sometimes to get some people to consider making such hard concessions - forces such as:  potentially losing a loved one, or losing both the House & the Senate and realizing different \\"mighty mandates\\" are in town.

0790731894|5.0|While a lot of reviewers took exception to Seagal being in the movie at all.  He may or may not be their cup of tea!  I think the movies were he gets to demonstrate his abilities in self defense are great!  I don't really care what happens backstage, whether he was killed off because of attitude or not!  I watched the movie because of the Russell and Seagal! You can find hundreds of thousands of women just as, or better looking than Halle Berry!   You reviewers would think it would have been great if Hilton, Spears or any other high priced woman of the night were to be in the movie.  Your only looking for that moment when you can see something that the edit room missed anyway!
B000002O7C|4.0|In the light of Basil Poledouris's passing, right now I'm finding myself listening to one of his better works: \\"The Hunt For Red October\\".<br /><br />The album opens with 'Hymn For Red October', Poledouris's best main title after Conan's.  The Russian chant gives this theme its power, although I fought with a couple of friends who were supportive of James Horner's Russian song in the main and end credits of \\"Red Heat\\"; but I have always considered Red October to be a great song.  There are intimate moments in this album that give us a break from the coming action, and they are better displayed in 'Two Wives', a cue that was never used in the film.  Another great moment is 'Ancestral Aid', where the Russian chorus burst in fury, showcasing the scene where the Red October manages to escape from a pursuing torpedo, and later coming to a calm, yet chilling second half.  And the action cues are a real treat here: I love the crescendos in the track 'Chopper', a track that truly makes the listener feel he/she is on board a helicopter.  'Nuclear Scam' is also quite impressive if we think that the Russian submarine's crew escapes from a fake nuclear accident.  Finally, we have 'Kaboom!', a relentless cue that makes us sweat, feeling that we're being chased by a submarine.  In general, this is a good work by the late Basil Poledouris.<br /><br />The only letdown, however, is the running time of thirty minutes of the whole album, probably because there is not much music in the movie.  In fact, as great as it sounds, the track 'Course Two-Five-Zero' is too short to be really appreciated at twenty one seconds.  Yet, if you want to appreciate one fine work from this fine composer, who left us recently, \\"The Hunt For Red October\\" might be your CD.
0679746048|5.0|Susanna Kaysen has written a beautifully poignant memoir of her voluntary commitment to a mental institution at the tender age of eighteen.  Since her two-year stay began in 1967, her diagnosis and treatment seem a little off by today's standards.  What must institutionalization have meant to a young girl from that time?  A time when ostracizing people for mental illness was the norm?<br /><br />Though slender, this memoir is packed with valuable and poignant insights as Kaysen looks back on that part of her life.  She mentions, \\"The brain talks to itself, and by talking to itself changes its perceptions.\\" And, \\"Insanity comes in two basic varieties, slow and fast.\\"  She goes on to describe these as viscosity and velocity.  \\"Viscosity causes the stillness of disinclination, velocity causes the stillness of fascination.\\"<br /><br />Kaysen describes the other girls institutionalized with her, sometimes humorously, but also discusses mental illness and how her diagnosis affected her.  One of the things that surprised me is that she was recommended to check in for two weeks by a therapist she'd only seen once and wound out being committed for two years, but she never once mentions feeling betrayed by the therapist.  Another thought of mine was how normal she seemed by today's standards.  People walk around everyday with her symptoms; what used to be aberration is now a norm.<br /><br />Kaysen's book is a fast read, highly enjoyable, well written, and a very insightful journey through her own illness that will touch the mind of the reader.  You'll certainly find yourself sympathizing with this confused young woman, and in the end wishing perhaps you had gotten to know her just a little better.  By this, I mean that the book could have been much longer and still have been just as fascinating and touching.  I highly recommend this book.  Enjoy!
B000FIMG68|5.0|The product is very good, I have finally caught up on Season 2
0743298020|4.0|I have to admit: I was absolutely enamored with this book... until I got to the end, when my feelings began to waver. Told by two narrators - one a best-selling author with a mysterious past, the other her young biographer - at first The Thirteenth Tale is wildly captivating. Learning about the Angelfield twins is like being drawn into tale that is part gothic ghost story and part modern mystery. Setterfield maintains this pitch for most of the book, but sadly, allows the narrative to falter somewhat towards the end. Although the culmination of the Angelfield history is fascinating, there is too much fluff on either side of it. A long set of uninteresting journal entries beforehand, and a drawn out \\"wrapping things up\\" section afterwards. Also, a few storyline questions were left unanswered - no reason for that after 406 pages. Still, this book did make my commute something to look forward to, no small feat considering I spend a good four hours on trains & subways every day!
B000G1ALRK|5.0|WOW! Thats about it. If you ONLY love the popish side of country (Emerson Drive, recent Tim McGraw & Faith Hill, and a even some Rascal Flatts)look away... nothing to intrest you. If you like your country soulful, traditional with a touch of rebel/southern rock country then Eric Church can help. <br /> <br />Not Since Joe Nichols', Dierks Bentley's, or Brad Paisley's debuts have I really been taken-in by the songwriting, message, melody, and subject matter of a new artist. I just can't say enough this album is amazingly crafted. I ask that people please support music like this... these albums are becoming scarce. <br /> <br />Every track is solid, but my favorites are the 3 track currently being played on satellite and terrestrial radio... \\"Before She Does\\" \\"How 'Bout You\\" and \\"Two Pink Lines.\\" I am also quite fond of \\"These Boots\\" \\"Lighting\\" \\"Can't Take It With You\\" \\"Pledge Allegiance To The Hag\\" and \\"Livin Part Of Life.\\" Yeah, thats most of the album... I told you this was a solid product.  <br /> <br />Church excels in storytelling and covering topics at real people can relate to, and not just \\"she left me\\" type of tune thats been rehashed for 12 tracks. Search for the lyrics to these songs and you will quickly see. From graduating high-school and becoming a man (What I Almost Was and The Hard Way), unwanted pregnacy( Two Pink Lines), a man about to be electrocuted for commiting murder (Lightning), ranting about bills politics and failed love (Before She Does), taking a break from lifes grind (Livin part of Life), being true to yourself (How Bout You) and a tune for the folks like me that miss real country (Pledge Allegiance To The Hag). <br /> <br />Ok now stop reading, buy this album and prove me right!

A chance.  <br /> <br />This book goes deep, deep inside teens world, inside our american society, inside our way of living, inside some areas of our couple and parent role .... Yes, in this so crual and horrible story, we can do a big statement of who we are... It's sad but it is.... Maybe it can bring some changes... <br /> <br />Congratulations to the autor.
0618680004|2.0|For any \\"old earth\\" fair minded Christian and even surprisingly any moderate Atheist/Agnostic one can get quite tired and fed up with the character generalisations that Dawkins makes: 2 distinct pigeon holes with 1) the Christian typically a fundamentalist with medieval ignorance or failing that 2) another curious type of person who is bad or mad for not accepting the words in this long yet well written but nonetheless rhetorical rant about trying to define a negative.  <br /> <br />Dawkins, whilst being a brilliant scientific author, has little interest in understanding theology because he does not consider it even an academic discipline. On the other hand, Prof Alister E McGrath is qualified to write his well written rebuttal (The Dawkins Delusion? published by SPCK in UK in Feb '07 and published by IVP in USA in May '07)about Dawkins' stance on the relationship between religion and science because not only is he a theology professor, he also has a PhD in biology.  <br /> <br />Yes, after reading Dawkins' books and McGrath's latest I feel that the jury is still very much out on whether those with faith in atheistic extremism (you know the type that misunderstand the fact that atheism is a faith and so insult \\"faith heads\\", and worship at the alter of the one true god of the \\"how\\" scientific method) will ever dispel the strong personal faith that I and many like me have in a mainstream \\"normal\\" inclusive God (Divine Love and Wisdom). Will \\"imagine no religion\\" to coin the Liverpool bard bring about a healthier or superior world or indeed a safer one? I doubt it. Man's \\"inhumanity to man\\" is a condition of mankind unfortunately. It is clear though that \\"religion\\" (or at least the corruption of it) can be a powerful motivator of hatred and violence and McGrath fully acknowledges this but let us not forget that it brought the momentum of civilisation with it too.  <br /> <br />Lest us forget though what history tells us about what extreme atheism/secularist leaders dowhen power comes or does not come quickly enough. I recommend reading Dawkins' book and McGrath's book as well as a companion book - Pape's \\"Dying to Win\\" as it is well worth a read about why terrorists really suicide bomb. Read elsewhere about what Stalin/Mao/Pol Pot/Hitler did in the last century to see what atheistic \\"new world order\\" brought about - probably the bloodiest and ugliest tyrannies the world has ever known.  <br /> <br />As for Science and Religion not being compatible? McGrath and many scientists say \\"nonsense\\". Coupled with the \\"how\\" we need the \\"why\\" questions to help explain our circumstances on this temporary physical plane i.e. why is the Universe so fine tuned and \\"just right\\"? Why was our Universe pregnant with the possibility of life at the point, just before time and space came into being and brought about our amazing conscious mind and free will to husband this unique World, through evolution?  <br /> <br />Read this well penned yet risible rhetoric spread out over 400pp - a large number of pages don't you think on something that \\"almost certainly does not exist\\" Prof Dawkins? :-).  <br />

B00005JPC7|4.0|Most of our life seems typed.  So it seems for IRS auditor, Harold Crick (Will Farrell), the updated equivalent of W.H.Auden's, \\"Unknown Citizen\\".  Harold lives his life with precision.  He is a math prodigy, and his life is dull and repetitive.   When he hears his life narrated by a mysterious voice (Emma Thompson), the prose begs for an explanation and an ending. This voice becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, shaking up his routine.  His inquest about this phenomena only brings about skepticism or derision.  Many understandably believe he is losing his mind.  He seeks first a psychiatrist, whose diagnosis is schizophrenia; then, he seeks what he really wants: literary help.  His sojourn connects with a bookworm lifeguard, Professor Jules Hilbert  (Dustin Hoffman), who takes him up on his paper chase.  Before the enigma resolves, matters really loosen up one day when he audits a radical owner of  a corner coffee/bakery shop,  (Maggie Gyllenhaal).   He is as charming as Zerox machine, and she is as friendly as a banchee, but they manage to fall in love.  Afterall, opposites do attract.    Getting to the bottom--or in this case the end--is the crux of the story.  Changes do come about in Harold and his life, but the journey, like life itself, is worth the focus and execution presented in the film.  Much more believable than the likable `Lake House,' and borrowing nothing more than an innovative consciousness presented in movies like `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' `Stranger Than Fiction' lives up to the story title and gives us pause to reflect on the alternatives in life and how they can envelop us--only if we let them. Marc Forster ably directs this film with startling realism accompanied by excellent editing, and Queen Latifah and Will Ferrell are comics who skillfully play it straight with a fine supporting cast.
B000HT386M|4.0|In \\"Click,\\" Adam Sandler stars as Michael Newman, an overworked, underappreciated architect who's let his job replace his family.  Fed up with not receiving his fair share at work and knowing that he's about to lose his family, Newman snaps, decides that his family needs a universal remote just like everybody else and hurries out of his house and into the only store that's open that evening, Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  What he finds in the Beyond (Way Beyond) section of the store is Morty (Christopher Walken), a sales clerk who gives him a universal remote that's a tad bit unusual.  It controls every facet of his life.  He can skip over watching his dog violate a stuffed duck, mute his wife during arguments, and basically bypass any of the ho-hum moments of his life in order to get to the good stuff.  Unfortunately, skipping over so much of his life means that Newman misses the small things that make life worth living, and the big things that make life either grand or miserable.<br /><br />In short, this flick is a play on the Christmas classic, \\"It's A Wonderful Life,\\" with the typical Sandler spin.  However, unlike many reviewers have stated, I don't think that the toilet humor that Sandler's accused of using in most of his past films is too distracting in this one.  The first half of the film is rather humorous, thanks to a wonderful supporting cast which includes Henry Winkler, Julie Kavner, Sean Astin, and the breathtaking Kate Beckinsale.  David Hasselhoff and Jennifer Coolidge also throw in some funny performances.<br /><br />It's the second half of the film that really makes \\"Click\\" click.  As Sandler's character ages, he begins to realize that he's not that great of a guy.  He also comes to find out that there are things in life that seem rather dull until you lose them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent flick.  It's more deserving of three and a half stars than four, but I'll round up based on the second half of the film.  It does drag at times, but it's all worth it.<br /><br />Recommended as a strong rental for casual Sandler fans and a definite purchase for those who love all things Sandler.it's all worth it. <br /> <br />Recommended as a strong rental for casual Sandler fans and a definite purchase for those who love all things Sandler.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|No other Meat Loaf album will live up to the awesome magnitude of the original \\"Bat out of Hell\\", however there are definitely remnants of that classic sound in this album. It's interesting to note that some of Meat Loaf's biggest hits were originally performed by Jim Steinman himself, or Ellen Foley's group Pandora's Box. \\"Bad for Good\\", \\"Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through\\", \\"Left in the Dark\\", \\"Surf's Up\\", \\"Lost Boys and Golden Girls\\", and \\"Out of the Frying Pan (and into the fire)\\" were all performed by Steinman on his Bad for Good album after Meat Loaf lost his voice. Hearing Meat perform these songs is very gratifying (Jim tries but doesn't sing that well)  If you want my opinion about this album, it's clearly his best work since Bat II and is definitely worth buying..far better than his last album \\"Couldn't Have Said it Better\\" which was painful to listen to even for a hardcore fan like myself.
B0001HLVS2|2.0|\\"Master and Commander - The Far Side of the World\\" is a great movie.  However, I received a defective DVD which made the middle third of the movie unviewable.  When looking at the readable side of the DVD after the movie froze part way through chapter 13, I could clearly see the defective area.  It looked as though someone had spilled a bit of acid on that part of the DVD. <br /> <br />Amazon.com's website instructed me to go to the manufacturer for replacement of manufacturer defects. <br /> <br />The manufacturer, 20th Centry Fox, provided me with return instructions and I shipped the DVD and information to them on Oct. 30th 2006.  I paid for the return shipping, and presumable there will be no other charges to get the replacement DVD. <br /> <br />It is now Nov. 11th and I am still waiting for my replacement DVD.
0618680004|5.0|Dawkin's writing is always passionate, here though is a polemic that screams urgency on nearly every one of its 350 odd pages. Clearly born of a growing dismay at the re-encroachment of religion into not only moral but political discourse, Dawkins has set out his lifelong objections to both the irrationality of religious belief and also to the damaging effects he argues it has on society and above all to children. In a particularly controversial and biting chapter he condemns the religious indoctrination of young people as a form of child abuse greater than that of the catholic priest sex scandals.<br /><br />I find Dawkin's prose electrifying, provocative and at times beautiful, particularly here when describing the compatibility of awe and wonder at the universe with the atheistic position. Dawkins attempts to rebut most of the historical arguments for God's existance, refute the claim that morality is dependent on at least a belief in God (if not his actual existence) and in general the idea that religion serves as some kind of Platonic noble myth keeping society sane, happy, moral and together. He ends the book by arguing that children should not suffer the abuse of being force fed religion, and instead should be raised as rational beings, helping to create a mature society in which scientific method determines questions of fact and philosophical reasoning that of moral value.<br /><br />I'm an aetheist, though I have a much too pessimistic view of human nature to call myself a humanist, but upon finishing the book I was rather swept away for a short time in a kind of hope that reason can indeed one day abolish dogma and superstition to produce both a fairer and a happier society. I'm rather left thinking though, that perhaps that could only be in a society of cloned Richard Dawkins, or at least of an unlikely human society where most people have a level of intellect and courage even approaching his. At one point in the book he refers to a positive correlation between intelligence and atheism without drawing any negative conclusions as to how difficult that leaves turning the mass of not so intelligent citizens into rational moralists.<br /><br />Due to his well known scientific dismissal of group selection theory, and despite a long discussion of 'memes', he doesn't seem to take on board the rather unfortunate but plausible possibility that whilst religion may be a clutch of often nasty Darwinian 'misfirings', selection processes involving memes may mean that those cultural groups who clothe these evolutionary blanks in the memetic robes of religion may in fact inevitably survive over those which don't. This is arguably something we are witnessing in parts of Europe where the increasingly secular populations are simply being replaced by the more fertile muslim populations. The survival of the religious 'go forth and multiply' meme vs the humanist feminist 'woman have the right to careers' meme seems to have one predictable outcome, both for the memes and the cultures that bear them.  Consider, Amsterdam, the citadel of European humanism, now a place where homosexual couples are afraid to openly show their love for fear of being beaten up for offending religious sensibilities.<br /><br />Another criticism in an otherwise excellent book, is that Dawkins spends far too little time rebuting the absurd charge, commonly thrown at him, that he is an atheistic 'fundamenatlist'.  And absurd as the comparison with Islamic radicals or Bible literalists may be, it is one that has become almost a deep rooted Pavlovian criticism of Dawkins even amongst highly intelligent intellectuals. This is an accusation, incidently, which Dawkins admits here is acutely painful to him.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and inspirational book and deserves to be read by as many people as possible. Although unlikely to be read with fair minds by religious believers, hopefully its fate is to become more than simply a 'Bible' preaching to already convertedaetheists. I would imagine  Dawkins aim in writing this book was to provide an inspiration for those wishing to fight the cancerous return of unthinking dogma in public life.  In this, I'm certain he has succeeded magnificently.aim in writing this book was to provide an inspiration for those wishing to fight the cancerous return of unthinking dogma in public life.

B000HEWEEY|5.0|This movie scared me as a kid! It was a really old movie then but will always be a classic. Sure the special effects are cheesy, the sets look funny and the acting is laughable at times but for some reason this movie is just COOL! It's the type of scary which leaves a lot to the imagination which makes it all the more frightening. It's about a crew of men in space who's ship gets stranded on a planet inhabited by a man, Morbius and his beautiful daughter Alterra. The planet was once home to a race known as the Krell who dissapeared and left behind their mysterious brain enhancing technology. My favorite part is when the 'monster' melts through the solid metal door and all the alarms are going off, talk about suspense! Something about the sound of the alarms wailing in the background and the door turning red hot was REALLY frightening. It was totally freaky! It's not a bloody or violent film compared to movies of today but it scares you on a much deeper level, proving that OUR MIND can be a greater enemy than any monster. This movie was ahead of it's time. It's a movie that is good for a wide range, both young and old and was made in a time when movies were smart and made you think and were more than just a money machine cranked out by greedy studios!
B000G759LW|5.0|These two CD's were a good combination. Her new style is really unique and awesome. She has some good meaningful songs with some of her old \\"dirty\\" ones too.
0345349571|5.0|Well done, Barbara Tuchman.  I think your book, though strictly speaking, history, reads like literature.  (Having said that I'm only half-way through it and I haven't finished it yet.)
B000H305U0|5.0|This CD is hot!  It has a variety of songs that are very addicting.  Justin has a beautiful voice and the music has a variety of beats.  None of the songs sound the same but they are all good.  Many times you only like 1 or 2 songs on a CD but not this one, for the most part they are all good.  I think he is expressing some of his past relationships and feelings on this CD, in one song in particular.  You should be able to figure it out!  Great CD!
B00005JNX0|5.0|It's rare a movie comes along that is good for both kids and adults. This one does it beautifully! I wish they made stuff like this when I was a kid! The animation is amazing, the celebrity voices are funny, the plot simply HILARIOUS! Sheltered zoo animals suddenly find themselves on an island...The rest is just pure joy! A fun movie I would watch again and great for all ages.

B00005N5S5|4.0|As I wrote in Collateral review, we should stop thinking in happy endings with no meanings. Take a Look at this film, if the terminator had killed everybody in the film, and returned to his era, this film would be among the most courageous, intelligent, creative ever. But again the poor director did the choice of impossible, a truly skinny and dumb girl killing that massive future man, and is always the same thing, the same dumb endings, I think that the demagogy of the directors conducted them to this. Imagine one thing, that robot coming, killing every people that deserve to, with absolute no remorse, and coming back, wow, what a film. But this kind of weak and feminist weak moral as in this film always put to the ground even good ideas. But I'm an optimistic and I hope one day one really intelligent director will be brave of creating a film with a male intelligent perspective of a possibility of human total destruction with no (liar, impossible) chance to the weak people. I like the way Arnold works in this, he with his lack of talent as actor fits perfectly to his role, \\"Sarah Connor, and Bang, bang\\".
0767802470|5.0|This is truly a masterpiece. A hard hitting, deeply moving film - as real as it gets. Worth every penny. <br />
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Who did my review disappear from the Amazon site?  I've been a customer of Amazon for years, now I ask, why I should think like the majority of mediocre people? Why should I like this outrageous Madonna? Only because people want I to like? I want my review back. Where is the liberty of expression?  Maybe Amazon did this because of Madonna's pressure, who knows?  I only said things that I really believe, is my opinion, I'm a free man.  Maybe Amazon only wants reviews saying good things about the goods in question in order of increasing sales. This is ridiculous!
6300182355|3.0|High camp.  Max von Sydow was great, and had some good lines (of the \\"pathetic Earthling\\" sort).  Am I the only one who had a huge crush on \\"Kala\\"?  (The movie could have used more of that evil dominatrix!)  And, of course, there's Queen's equally campy musical score.
B000H7JD4K|4.0|I'm happy to hear Maiden writing some great new songs again. I really liked Brave New World, but was dissapointed with Dance of Death. This latest offering from Eddie and the boys is certainly a classic effort, so if you're a fan of \\"classic\\" Maiden - give this one a listen!
B000009EAD|5.0|As an Iced Earth fan who owns all of their CDs, i must say that this is their best.  From start to finish this album is filled with incredible songs, and just has such a complete feel to it.  This album has something for every metal fan of any genre.  Melancholy is incredible, as is the trilogy.  Great place to start if your new to the band.  One of the best metal cds ever recorded.
B000EQH2QK|4.0|Latin superstar Shakira gave the other chart hitters a run for their money with her No. 1 international smash\\"Hips Don't Lie,\\" considered by many to be the song of the summer.  The track is instantly likable and its sexy call-and-response dialogue (between the famous hip-shaker and islander Wyclef Jean) sizzles.  Oral Fixation is a brilliant release and definitely lives up to the instant smash that \\"Hips\\" provided Shakira.  From the amazing opener \\"How Do You Do,\\" a haunting questioning of faith song that soars during the chorus, to the dance-oriented \\"Animal City\\" (which discusses the downside of fame) and closing disco single \\"Timor,\\" tried-and-true rock hit \\"Don't Bother\\" and poetic \\"Dreams For Plans,\\" Oral seduces the listener throughout each of its tracks.  Sure, there are some tepid moments here, like the sometimes good-sometimes bad \\"Illegal,\\" horrific \\"Hey You\\" and bland \\"The Day and the Time,\\" but for the most part Shakira soars on record.  Her voice is in fine form as well.  Though Fijacion Oral might sound more genuine (since it's widely agreed Shakira sounds better singing in her native Spanish than in English), the English-language Oral Fixation is a much better and thorough album.
B000EF7W3Y|5.0|I loved the original Fisherman's Blues. That album is one of my favorites from the eighties. I will not even classify it as an eighties album since it is timeless. This extended release is such a surprise, I am in awe. I believe the second disc alone is as good or even better than the original. It does not feel like outtakes or demos, it feels like a stand alone disc. The Waterboys need to release the disc that needs to be released.... The Fisherman's Blues Sessions. A four disc release consisting of all of the seesions recorded in the eighties for the Fisherman's Blues recordings. These recordings represent all that is right with music; The love of music, for music sake. There are no producers, music executives, cookie cutter money making agendas involved. We need more personal music produced today. This is so refreshing it is unbelievable. Buy this and discover music of the soul.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Like a new toy or a brand new pair of shoes Colombia-born and bred superstar Shakira is just as likable and irresistible on Laundry.  Despite having never spoken English before making this disc she sounds quite adept singing it, as evident in lead single \\"Whenever, Wherever,\\" by far the best song on record.  This unique blend of Latin rhythms and Middle East-influenced instrumentation isn't just heard in the smash aforementioned lead single--it echoes throughout the entire disc.  From the thundering tango opener \\"Objection\\" to the soft-and-soaring \\"Underneath\\" Shakira bleats her Latin heart out over great tracks like \\"Rules,\\" \\"Ready,\\" \\"Fool,\\" \\"Te Dejo Madrid\\" and the English-language version of \\"Ojos Asi\\" (Shakira's big international hit) known here as \\"Eyes Like Yours.\\"  \\"Suerte\\" and \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio\\" (\\"Whenever, Wherever\\" and \\"Objection,\\" respectively) are presented as bonuses in Shakira's native Spanish, and sound just as good, if not a little better (since the performer sounds more comfortable, and understandly so).  There's a slight misstep here and there, but overall Laundry is arguably the best Latin-tinged album since Selena's last.
B000I5X81K|2.0|I have loved the music of Josh Groban since the beginning.  this new album is not his best. the music is lacking the spark.  He can do better. after playing this CD over and over. I was wrong.  some of the songs are not my favorites, but it is worth it for at least 2 of them.  \\"you are loved is beautiful and February song\\" is hauntingly beautiful.   sorry for the first 3 lines!
B00097A5HW|3.0|I have to say that after I heard international No. 1 \\"La Tortura\\" I just had to go out and purchase Fijacion Oral to see how amazing it is.  Shakira's trademark bleat is in fine form here--unfortunately \\"La Tortura\\" is really the only track that has hit potential.  Fijacion Oral is a consistent release but nothing remotely approaches that catchy lead single.  Some songs get pretty close, though, like the rock-oriented \\"La Pared,\\" disco-infused \\"Las De La Intuicion,\\" the sweet \\"Dia De Enero\\" and the thundering \\"Lo Imprescindible.\\"  Despite its obvious flaws Shakira's signature sound pulls the bland material through well enough that you'll find yourself enjoying Fijacion in its entirety.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|I've been a fan of Meatloaf since the beginning and always thought he was before his time. Bat Out of Hell 1 was a masterpiece. Part 2, while not up to it's predecessor, had some acceptable tracks. This lastest entry is pure dreck with the exception of Meatloaf's duet of \\"It's all coming back to me\\". Very sad and dissapointing entry from a staple of Rock.
B000006TRV|2.0|I bought the CD because I watched David Gilmour on AOL's Sessions Archive and they played Comfortably Numb. I love that song.  This CD is a disappointment.  Even Comfortably Numb sounds better sung by David and his band then it did back in 1979.   <br /> <br />Save your money.  This is just more of Roger Water's ranting and raving.  He, for some reason, wanted to be a looney and that certainly comes across. <br /> <br />I hope David and his present band make and album with old Pink Floyd favorites.  They are so much better now, both vocally and accoustcally.
B000001EYO|3.0|as others have pointed out, this album is not true to the movie since it does not include the Credence tracks, but it is worth buying just for the Gypsy Kings cover of Hotel California.  I listened to it on a visit to LA last week as I drove down Florence Avenue near Pacific looking for Tommy's Burgers.  Double chili Cheese, please!
1401302378|5.0|The book was a grate read. It explains the concept of the long tail and the value behind all the niche markets in it opposed to the mainstream hits and best sellers with the right mix of economics, business, technology and future prediction. The author interesting style and cases makes this book grate all the way
B00005JP8V|2.0|Ok, if you're a young teenager with all the things young teenagers are raging with, then you could like this movie. However, if you like movies that don't insult your intelligence you might want to look elsewhere. Let me first say that I saw this purely on spontaneity. I was in the movie line, saw the poster, and decided to try it after asking the teenage ticket taker if it was any good. I should have gone to Talladega Nights.<br /><br />The Covenant is Harry Potter meets the Matrix, with a twist of horror. It follows a group of four young men whose bloodline has been infused with a terrible power. Each is bound by a covenant of secrecy. However, when the body of a dead student is discovered, secrets start to unravel and a traitor is found in their midst. The movie is full of heavy metal, scantly-clad teens, and a couple scary scenes.  I found it annoying how the lighting and thunder was constant throughout the whole movie. Couldn't they think of something else to use for dramatic emphasis? The acting was stiff and emotionless. You could tell the people were models, not actors. The final battle-scene was nothing more than a cheap Matrix rip-off (at best). At this point of the movie, I had the stifle laughter because I couldn't take anything serious.<br /><br />I'm just going to level with you, the reader, and say I couldn't wait to get out of the theatre when this was done. I was genuinely embarrassed for being there and by the looks of the people around me, I wasn't alone. Everyone was squeezing to get out of the theatre fast. As something on the Sci-Fi channel this wasn't terrible, but as a full-blown movie where you buy popcorn and bring friends this should have never happened.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Who you gonna call? Sam and Dean Winchester, that's who!If you have a pesky ghost, vampire, reaper, shapeshifter or any other supernatural being making your like miserable, these two brothers can make them vanish.  So, if you see a black car pull up, Black Sabbath songs belting out from the cassette track, you know that the Winchester brothers have arrived to save the day.<br /><br />Jared Padalecki and Jenson Ackles give an outstanding performence in each episode.  These two Texas boys breath life into their characters and make the show fun to watch.  You'll find yourself laughing at their antics and wise cracking comments at times, other times your cheering for them to kick some serious supernatural butt, but most of all you just really want them to finally reunite with their dad.<br /><br />This is a show you really need to see.

0205313426|5.0|William Strunk's first publication of The Elements Of Style was in use at Cornell University in 1919. It was published in the New Yorker in 1957. It has been republished in a variety of forms, including editions with E.B. White.<br /><br />Why has this book survived almost a century? The answer is simple. This is the best book on composition. You need no other. There are paperback, hardback and pdf file versions. The original is available online at bartleby dot come. However you choose to acquire this book, just do it.
B000002GQH|5.0|I first heard this album when my brothers came back from boarding school in Wisconsin at Xmas '69.  In the late '60's this sound from the Moody Blues was extremely \\"cutting edge\\".  The Beach Boys, Beatles, and even Stones had albums that mixed rock and avant guard \\"sounds\\".  But this album from the Moody Blues seemed to make classical music \\"cool\\".  The big sound of the orchestra behind their band was very different not only to a 11yr old, but for listeners in general. Lovely To See You Again & Have You Heard had nothing to do with what was being played on AM radio...and that made it all the more cool.  This album still holds up well.  Take a listen and try to visualize the last year of the '60's.
0930289234|4.0|Watchmen was everything I hoped it would be and more. The characters are what make the story interesting. Initially the reader is thrown into the world and unsure who is who. After a few chapters the reader is able to puzzle out who is who as the book focus on each of the main character's stories. I can't say much without ruining the ending, but while I thought I knew what would happen next, the ending was quite a surprise. Enjoy.
0385338686|4.0|Another funny girly story from Sophie Kinsella.  The heroine is a work-obsessed, intelligent, perfectionist, go-getter career gal -- a female archetype that I could totally relate to (smile!)  She makes an (apparently) fatal mistake which sends her into a tailspin.  She lands herself in a bizarre and funny predicament.  I liked this book because it shows how we women can transform ourselves into whatever we set our minds to.

0385338082|5.0|I loved this book.  The beginning airplane scene is very funny and leads to an even funnier sequence of events for the protaganist.  One of my FAVORITE chick lit book that I could read and reread over and over.  I thought this book was so romantic, and I hope they make it into a movie.  It's sorta like Bridge Jones meets Steve Jobs.  Weird, eh?
B000AU9UYM|4.0|Batman Has always been one of my favorite comic heroes. This movie departs from the somewhat whimsical, goofyfied villans of the last few installments and returns to a more serious feel. It explores how Bruce Wayne evolves into Batman from his Ninja like training to his cool gear.His mentor becomes his nemesis in a great finale. This is a really cool movie. I am an amature film maker so the \\"making of\\" features on the dvd are a real education. My only critique is that some of the fight scenes are shot so in tight that you don't get a good look at the action.
B000J10ERO|5.0|I must say I was never the biggest Superman Fan.  I just never thought there was enough risk involved and being an alien is kind of cheating, however, Superman Returns changed my mind.  The plot was good and the characters all very interesting. For the first time in the series I was really on the edge of my seat.  Kevin Spacey is amazing as Lex!  I love the suits with the combat boots.  Overall, this is just a really great action movie.  You don't have to love the Superman series to really enjoy yourself.  I think fans of Superman and comic book movies will also really enjoy this movie. This one is definately worth the effort!
0060989157|5.0|This book was fantastic I loved the whole thing and read it in about 2 days. I would have liked to hear from Tommy Lee more as I found him to be the funniest and most interesting to read. All in all an awesome book that deserves 5 stars!!
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine is so funny it actually hurts.  I was laughing so hard I was crying for most of the movie, its that good.  That being said it is a fabulous drama.  One of the best films of the year.  The writing, which is great portrays the most realistic family I've seen on screen in a really long time!  If you love smart humor and drama that is as funny as life you must watch this movie!
B00006G8HX|5.0|Most intelligent movie critics like the even numbered Star Trek movies (II, IV, VI) because they believe the the odd numbered ones (I, III, V) are inferior. But buying \\"The Search for Spock\\" is worth the money. Now I am not defending this odd numbered movie because I am a trekkie--I have a real job and do not live with my parents.  <br /> <br />This movie is as good as \\"Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan,\\" and \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\\" because the plot is really interesting, and the characters are just as well developed as Star Trek II. For example, enter Christopher Lloyd, playing the villian Kirk must face in this adventure. Commanding all \\"1.21 gigowatts\\" of his bird of prey, Lloyd portrays a merciless Klingon who kills his girlfriend, a starship crew, and a defensless scientist. He is out to get the secret of the Genesis doomsday weapon (it is not the \\"flux compasator\\"). <br /> <br />One can tell how much more money Paramount invested in this sequal to \\"Khan.\\" The special effects are stunning because more ships are featured, and an enormous, mushroom-shaped space station is where the Enterprise docks above Earth. Although Nicholas Meyers (Trek II, IV, VI) did not participate in making this movie, Leonard Nimoy's directing debut is very successful.  <br /> <br />What enhances the drama and emotion is the superior music score by James Horner. His \\"Khan\\" soundrack has lots of catchy theme songs, and he continues with the consistent music of the Genesis adventures in \\"The Search for Spock.\\" Horner is the John Williams of the Star Trek movies (yes, Jerry Goldsmith is probably more award winning, but I believe Horner packs more memorable tunes per movie that he conducts in the Trek saga). <br /> <br />This two disc edition has Nimoy's director's commentary and also a hilarious interview with William Shatner, who sarcastically gloats how he \\"saved the day\\" when Paramount studios caught fire. Michael Okuda's text commentary is very entertaining for the fans. The second disc interviews the guy who actually perfected the Klingon language. (Can you believe that an actual linguist created this crazy language! Can you believe he translated the Bible into Klingon!)  <br /> <br />After adding \\"The Search for Spock\\" and \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" to your DVD collection, you can enjoy investing in the third installment of the Genesis Trilogy:  <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\"  <br /> <br />To watch an adventurous conclusion for the original cast, please get:  <br />\\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.\\" <br /> <br />BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! For another great Star Trek trilogy in the 10 move saga, watch:  <br /> <br />\\"Star Trek: First Contact\\" (a.k.a. 'Picard and Data vs. the Borg')  <br />\\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\" (a.k.a 'Picard and Data vs. Aliens with Wrinkle Problems')  <br />\\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" (a.k.a. 'Attack of the Picard and Data Clones')  <br /> <br />WORDS OF ENTERTAINMENT CAUTION!  <br />Don't bother with \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" (a.k.a. 'The Search for God.') and \\"Star Trek Generations,\\" either. They all rank as a made-for-TV movie  <br /> <br />--Live long and Prosper!
B000J103PC|4.0|This is not the greatest movie ever, but it has a lot of really funny movies that make the whole thing worth while.  It is kind of a chick movie, but I think some of the joke will be funny to a male audience too.  At least they shouldn't be in too much pain.  Meryl Streep is amazing.  She is just so awful it is wonderful.  It is really worth watching just to see her.  So, watch this movie without expecting too much and you have two hours of fun!
0060922583|5.0|What a joyous and fascinating read.  The author ties in everything under the sun I have studied before and combines it into a great big smorgasboard of the little gems I've collected along my growing path of intellectual exploration and spirituality.  I was very excited to see authors and scientists that I've read and studied (since highschool physics and calculus days) pop up everywhere on the pages.  WOW! (nostalgia taking over) <br /> <br />The range of players and stars in this book are quite tantalizing, from doctors, Nobel-winning researchers, scientists in pages from Encyclopaedia Britannica, physicists amongst the ranks of Einstein (or better ;)), psychologists, psychiatrists, hardcore drug addicts, shamans, monks, religious icons, cancer patients, psychosis patients, OBEs, MSDs, NDEs, celebrity authors, aliens, deities, and people from the future. <br /> <br />I kept bursting into laughter at the uncanny wit Talbot employed in presenting supportive/illustrative data on synchronicity (and all related holographic principals, models and postulations).  Equally amusing is the craft with which he rationalized miraculous/stupendous events that occurred throughout human history and the history of science itself, all of which insinuate viability of the holographic, omnijective, holotrophic models of \\"reality\\" or \\"what is\\". <br /> <br />More importantly is perhaps the suggestion that WE SHOULD TAP INTO THIS KNOWLEDGE!! <br /> <br />Despite the numbers and cases presented being extremely suggestive of untapped powers in the human mind, just remember, Talbot did an excellent job collecting data that support the central theme (in ways that a research paper is constructed) and thus, this is more of a TOOL book than a \\"Truth\\" book.  <br /> <br />In fact, Talbot himself repeated Bohm's philosophy that NOTHING is FINAL, NOTHING is absolute and no theories are \\"perfect\\".  <br /> <br />Here I must express one of the themes I picked up that I find immensely helpful:  <br /> <br />Nothing is CAUSAL... there is no \\"Cause and Effect.\\"  Things actually are observed to be causal from the \\"normal\\" belief system (or patterns our brains currently use to discipher codes into \\"reality experiences\\"), but when pryed and observed in a different way, there is strong evidence that things occur ACAUSALLY on a more fundamental level, time and space are fabrications of our minds and again... there is NO CAUSE AND EFFECT.  <br /> <br />Many \\"things\\" and \\"processes\\" we believe to be otherwise may be but RITUALS and PLACEBOs.  While this will definitely trigger dismay or discomfort in many people, I find it to be absolutely exhilarating. <br /> <br />The only thing I find to be lacking, however, is the scarcity of documentaries on \\"personal\\" achievements and events outside of subjects related to life/death issues, laboratory physics, physical health, and psychiatric health.  There are no references to any holographic possibilities when it came to social achievement, building the pyramids, historical wars, leadership, financial talent, etc etc outside of the above mentioned subject matters. <br /> <br />Perhaps the great insight into the character, strength, and professionalism of true scientists at work touches on what I found lacking.  I think it's better than a movie in aspects and portrayals of human excellence when it comes to these scientists' talent, intelligence, meticulous search for truth, and courage. =) <br /> <br />Well wherever you are, keep exploring!  A highly recommended read that will bring you to a new level of exhilaration and will help you mold your very own scientific explorations in support of spiritual enlightenment.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I highly recommend this CD.I first heard it on NPR radio and just had to order it.There is not one bad song on it;each one has its own individual sound and enjoyment.Emmylou & Mark make a great bluegrass duo.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This DVD is a must have for all Pink Floyd fans and music fans. Not only does this DVD bring back to light the incredible energy and creativeness of the one and only Pink Floyd light show but the sound and reproduction of the music is fantastic. Watching this DVD makes me glad to know I saw Pink Floyd once live but it also will make you yearn for just one more shot at seeing this music live. Who needs Roger Waters anyway?

B000AARKOO|3.0|Is it a coincidence that a movie based on Christian - Muslim relations was to come out after the 9-11 terrorist attacks?  Maybe, maybe not. The movie itself is quite good in many aspects, but could have been a lot better.    First, the acting.  Coming out in the summer of 2005, this movie probably had more big name stars in it that most of the summer crop.  Jeremy Irons, Liam Neeson, David Thewlis, Edward Norton, and Orlando Bloom lead of an international cast highlighted by many actors famous for both stage and screen performances of medieval roles.  The lead role went to Orlando Bloom and this movie was advertised as his breakout role.  Unfortunately, his acting, or lack thereof, is totally overshadowed by the other actors and actresses.  There are many moments where he is silent and it seems nary a thought is going thru the character's mind.  Luckily, all the other roles were played well, especially the parts of Saladin and King Baldwin.  Both Edward Norton and Ghassan Massoud portray well the leaders who shouldered so much weight on their backs in public, and handle internal bickering in private from subordinates.      Second is the setting.  Taking place in what is now Israel, Italy and France, the movie should have been filled with grand scenes of the terrain of these areas; such as lush forests, expansive deserts, and rocky mountains.  Instead, the only grand vistas are the occasional shots of armies marching to battle.  This movie should have a taken a cue from Jackson's LOTR in terms of cinematography.    Third is the music.  A movie of this magnitude should have hired John Williams for a complete orchestral score with dedicated pieces for each scene and the major characters.  Instead, I cannot remember a single tune from this movie's soundtrack.       Fourth is the action scenes.  These were truly amazing in every respect; grand, chaotic, bloody, realistic, grim with sweat and dust covering the troops on both sides.  But the drawback is the sudden sword fighting skills of Bloom's character, Balian.  In this respect, this movie copies of Pirates of the Caribbean.  In both movies, Bloom's character starts of as a blacksmith who happens to make swords, and ends up displaying very impressive combat skills.      Fifth is the look and sound of the characters.  If you look at pictures of people from the 1950s and earlier, you will notice the prevalence of bad teeth, and bad skin due to a variety of ailments, injuries, diseases, etc...  1000 years ago the average health of humans was much worse than now, yet notice how healthy and wholesome the knights look.  Clear skin, straight teeth abound.  These are soldiers, yet none have scars on them.  Related to this is the speech.  Most of the knights are supposed to be French, yet they are played by actors from the British Isles and have distinctive British accents.  Likewise, why do so many of the Arab soldiers speak English.  The makers of this movie should have taken a hint from Mel Gibson and had all the Christians speak Latin.  That would have made everything more believable.      All in all a good movie and worth the 2.5 hours of watching it.  But it was not the best movie of 2005.
B000FIMG68|5.0|We anxiously awaited the release of the 2nd season of \\"Lost\\" and were not disappointed! It is a beautifully packaged set, with many wonderful bonus features added. Our personal favorites were \\"Lost Connections\\", and \\"The World According to Sawyer\\". This set was worth the wait, and we will be on the list for season 3 when released. If you are a fan of this intriguing and utterly fascinating series, you will not want to pass up the opportunity to purchase this commercial-free set that you will want to watch again and again.
0446615625|3.0|Caleb Shaw, Library of Congress employee and antiquarian book expert, Milton Farb, ex-Jeopardy champion and computer whiz suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder, Reuben Rhodes, former NIS operative, and Oliver Stone, a cemetery groundskeeper with no apparent past, are an unlikely collection of eccentric, oddball misfits. They've formed \\"The Camel Club\\" - a small secretive group that holds regular meetings in the middle of the night to discuss their conspiracy theories and their darkest fears about Washington government operations! When, in the course of one of their midnight gatherings on Theodore Roosevelt Island, they inadvertently witness a murder, they find themselves up to their collective backsides in a plot that reaches to the highest levels of the government. The killers - a couple of rogue federal agents whose actions are being directed by a hidden mastermind - discover that their actions did not go unobserved and will now do anything to cover their tracks! But, we also quickly discover that they're bit players in an extraordinary, complex plan to kidnap the president and hold him ransom to Islamic terrorist demands. The US has its finger on THE button and the imminent launch of a warhead to Damascus threatens to push the world over the brink into a nuclear war.<br /><br />My initial reaction to \\"The Camel Club\\" was disappointment! The plot was interesting enough alright and the discussions of the world's geo-political situation were solidly informative but the characters were cartoonish and the dialogue was downright stilted. At the mid-way point of the book, I knew I was going to finish the book but had mentally relegated my rating to \\"below average\\". \\"The Camel Club\\" was certainly not up to the standard I wanted to impose on Baldacci as a result of my enjoyment of past successes like \\"The Simple Truth\\".<br /><br />Then came the second half of the book! The plot heated up dramatically and escalated into the page turner that I had been anticipating when I cracked the cover in the first place - overwrought and somewhat over that Hollywood top, to be sure - but compellingly enjoyable nonetheless with a suitably large suspension of belief! Sadly, the dialogue never did approach credible reality but the character development was exceptionally well done. The four club members evolved from weakly drawn oddballs into real men with skills, aspirations, interesting quirks and warm personalities that most readers will want to see more of. Alex Ford, a Secret Service agent on the outs in the twilight of his career, and his romantic interest, Kate Adams, a Department of Justice attorney and part-time bartender, were wonderfully crafted. Lucille Whitney-Houseman, Kate's feisty octogenarian landlady was a knee-slapping, brilliant comic masterpiece!<br /><br />For me, the highlight of the entire novel was the stomach churning, electrically charged scene in which Acting President, Ben Hamilton, wrestles with himself and his cabinet over the decision to launch a nuclear warhead which would flatten Damascus and instantly snuff out six million lives. While his military advisers press for a pre-emptive strike as revenge against the terrorist kidnapping plot, Andrea Mays, the Secretary of State, assumes the role of the more pacifist voice of reason.<br /><br />\\"The Camel Club\\" will never be labeled literature, to be sure, but it did manage to achieve the status of an enjoyable read! Baldacci fans and thriller readers won't go amiss with it!<br /><br />Paul Weisse cover in the first place - overwrought and somewhat over that Hollywood top, to be sure - but compellingly enjoyable nonetheless with a suitably large suspension of belief!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved this set of the shows. It makes me understand the movie Serenity a lot more and a lot of the humor. There are a few episodes that aren't exactly kid appropriate, but its a new twist on sci-fi and I would love to see them make more.
B000002H97|5.0|Definitely their most commercial album and in that sense to most people probably their best. Nothing will ever touch Master of Puppets in my opinion, but from beginnning to end this a top notch album without a single weak track. If you're a diehard metal fan and never listen to anything else, you might want to avoid this one and stick with the pre-black albums. However, if you love a solid hard rock/metal album this is one of the handful that is a must own.
0446528056|3.0|I am always weary of reading a Nicholas Sparks book as I am always afraid that I will be disappointed in the end and this time I was.  While I loved the book initially, I knew towards the last third of the book that I was going to be disappointed.  The book did not end the way I had wanted it to, which would've been the \\"how predictable\\" way as other readers might put it, but I wanted to read a sappy, happy ending.
B000002HMH|4.0|I've been on a heavy metal/hard rock kick lately and have been listening to a lot of albums that I've never listened to or just haven't listened to in a long time. This is one of those I've dug back up after a couple of years and have to say this is much better than I remember. Maybe my tastes have changed some over the years but this along with ReLoad are great rock albums. Now are they great standing next to the old Metallica albums from years past....No...but compared to most hard rock/metal albums released from bands these days they make for a great listen. If these were released by anyone else they would probably be considered masterpieces. I think if you people can get past the fact that these are in the traditional Metallica mold and just a good hard rocking album they'll probably enjoy it.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|I edited this because I'm not as much of an A7X fan as I was before. I still think they're a super talented band and one of the better ones of this generation. Synster gates and Zacky vengeance are a great guitar tandem. This is a solid album and I like their older stuff a little better than the newer stuff.

B000005B0U|4.0|The fineness music that I have heard in a long time. Ghost riders was a very refreshing tune done in a realistic beat. Of couse, the rest of the album brought the era of the 70's and 80's back to a tempo which made my big leg to bounce in rhythm.
B000ICM5VW|3.0|The picture quality is obvious great and the Picture-in-Picture features are very nice, however overall it really lacks the same bonus material you'd find on a regular DVD such as Deleted Scenes, full movie commentary (the PiP is a combination of commentary and behind-the-scenes), and other things that most people have come to expect. If you want this movie and have an HD DVD player/drive it is probably worth it, as long as you understand what you're missing.
038532653X|5.0|I read Skellig a little while back and even today I couldnt stop thinking about how well thought out a book it was. It is an easy to read book that you'll likely finish in a day. David Almond did a fantastic job at bringing the story of Michael, Mina, and of course Skellig to life on the pages. Excellent book for kids as well, 5 stars!
B000I5X81K|1.0|I've seen Josh Groban in concert I have the first two cds and one of the live ones. This album is garbage there is no power in his voice anymore no songs like you raise me up or The Prayer. I was very disappointed with this album maybe if I listen to it more I'll learn to live with it but as for now I wonder what happened with this. He had some great duets as well in his other albums the new one not so much. Also anyone want to take a stab why he sang lullaby? Can you say thats the icing on the cake for why this album is disappointing!

B00078XGRO|3.0|The film is Good Fun. It is a great Story, and the FX and production is what make this film superb. The DVD has HEAPS of great Extras, and very good Detail. <br />Frakes was not the first choice for director, even he says that they were hoping for a bigger, better action director.But, Frakes got the job. And its hard to go wrong with a stellar cast, especially a cast that influences the script ( Stewart made considerable story \\"suggestions\\" that shifted the balance of the story flow). <br />As a film, yes it is good, but as a Star Trek film, I would rate this  even less than Star Trek 5, and its problems were  enormous. By all accounts the production of FIRST CONTACT was a breeze in comparison. <br />And the great thing is that you decide how you feel on all these issues, because the two disc set is extremely comprehensive in basically  all  areas of the film. <br />Love the Role  Alice Krige plays, but hey, I would see a film with her in it, same  way I would watch anything  by Sandra Bullock.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is not your usual sappy romantic movie. Robin Williams goes into Hell to save his wife, and we get a look ay one possible interpretation of Heaven. There's adventure, romance, and suspense all in one movie. If you're looking for a funny Robin Williams, this movie is NOT for you. He's serious, tender, loving and a devoted father and husband in this movie.

B0001W8Q9Y|4.0|I've owned a couple of early Marillion releases for quite some time. Most notably SFAJT and Fugazi. Both are outstanding albums. However, I never really listened much after Fish left the band. Actually, I haven't heard any of Hogarth's stuff until I listened to this album.     Well, I was actually pleasently suprised by this album. Invisible Man started out kind of slow, not really a problem, but then it just kicked it up about 10 notches to the finale. Now, I know a lot of die hard marillion fans are going to hate me for this .. but .. I don't think I ever heard this kind of emotion come out of Fish. The entire album just reeks of soul. Pure emotion .. Now, that's not to say I think Fish's stuff wasn't good .. Actually, it was great. I just think Hogarth shows a hell of a lot more emtotion, especially in this album.     Besides \\"The Invisible Man\\", which may be the only pure-prog track on this album, other highlists include \\"Ocean Cloud\\" despite the apparent Pink Floyd rip-off in the middle. It features some pretty powerful drumming and some cool bass lines near the end.     Now onto Neverland, probably my favorite track on the album. This is one of the greatest album closers I have ever heard. It's definately up there with \\"heart of the sunrise\\", \\"Evil Karn 9\\", \\"Supper's Ready\\". Not really in terms of technical ability and whatnot .. However, it just closes the album on a perfect note. This is the emtoion I am talking about. It's absolutely brilliant. Great, great bass lines thrown in here too.     In short, this is a very well done album. Not REALLY prog. Again, this is quasi-prog. If you're a diehard straightfoward PROGRESSIVE fan: You might want to stay away. However, if you're pretty open about your music and don't mind the emtional stuff over the technical stuff, then this album is for you! It's not great, but it's very pleasing on the ears.
B000002UAU|5.0|Review no.1044. Whew! That's a lot of customer reviews, but I'm not a bit surprised. Originally released in 1967, one could say this was like one of THE first (if not,the first) true art rock / psychedelic albums. All thirteen of these tracks are true classics in EVERY sense of the word. Buy a second back-up CD, you'll likely wear your first copy out. Tunes like the title cut \\"Sgt.Pepper's...\\",the trippy \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\", \\"Fixing A Hole\\" (my personal favorite of this CD reissue), \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\", \\"Lovely Rita(Meter Maid)\\" and \\"A Day In The Life\\" practically had this disc glued inside my home entertainment center. Think just HOW influential this lp has been. Highly recommended.
0743289412|5.0|I totally agree.  This will be viewed as one of Mr. King's most important works, for all of the reasons you list. <br />I am listening to the CD version (I will also \\"read\\" it) - and must say that the publishers could not have picked a more perfect reader.  I will now go seek out all of Mare Winningham's films.  She is truly amazing, and makes the transition between Lisey/Scott/young Scott/Daddy  -- effortlessly. <br />This book is a marvelous love story.
0553573403|5.0|Having not read a good book in some time, I had heard great things about this series and decided to see if they were true with the first book. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />'A Song of Ice and Fire' is an excellently written story (despite historical similarities) that diverges from your usual hum-drum tale of epic war. The characters are deeper and more varied, and they are mortal; Martin is not afraid to kill off, maim, and cripple his main and lesser main characters like some authors are, and this brings some interesting aspects to the story (such as the evolution of the young character Bran...I won't give any spoilers, though). There will be characters you love (I personally like Tyrion Lannister and Littlefinger, especially the sarcastic quips of the latter), and characters you can't wait to have killed off (Viserys, anyone?), and they will probably change throughout the story.<br /><br />The story goes deeper than a lot of fantasy, being driven by political intrigue, manipulation, and betrayals. There are battles and fights, of course...but they are not the bread-and-butter of the series from what I have seen thus far. Another thing to note is the lack of magic in the story; it is spoken of and present as a background device, but you won't be seeing many wizards here. This, again, is a pleasant detour from the norm.<br /><br />Martin goes into great detail with his characters and the story itself. If you prefer something fast-moving like the Icewind Dale trilogy (do note that I am definitely no fan of Salvatore...) where much detail tends to be left out, this series might not be up your alley. Where Salvatore might only be able to muster two pages, Martin can crank out five or six. Again, if you enjoy a fast moving story that skips the finer points in lieu of action, this may not be for you.<br /><br />The only fault I can personally hold against this book is the aforementioned similarities to real historical events in the middle ages. However despite these things being used as a framework, the world itself is certainly Martin's own, as are the characters and the great houses.<br /><br />I cannot put this book down, and it's time to order the next one. Five out of five!ite these things being used as a framework, the world itself is certainly Martin's own, as are the characters and the great houses. <br /> <br />I cannot put this book down, and it's time to order the next one.

B000J4QWMC|2.0|First of all, please don't waste your money buying it. I'd wait till it hits cable. The movie was very dark, and nothing like the television show(that it was inspired from?). If you're looking for what was so cool about the show, you won't find it in the film. I'll give it 2 stars at best.
B00005JPAJ|1.0|Babel is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The begining of the film starts out with a little brother watching his sister bathe and then he gets caught. His brother says stop it. Then a family friend comes over to give the family a rifle to shoot jackels. They hit a van which hits a woman. All hell breaks loose. Then comes the Japan story line which was totally pointless. The whole story line was too gross to watch. Every scene she is either showing her crotch or is naked. I wanted to leave the film because it was just gross. Then the mexican storyline. Children are left in the desert. Will they die? I really wish I didn't see this movie. This movie is far too depressing to ever ever watch again. Babel gets an F from me.
B000I5X81K|4.0|My favorite track is a revised oldie, Track 10 \\"Un Giorno Per Noi,\\" which is \\"A Time For Us\\" from \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\" I wonder who will be skating to this one. Maybe all of them.<br /><br />If you'd like to hear this song in English, check out tenor Marius Evangelista on the Web and on ITunes.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural quickly became one of my favorite shows on tv and I looked forward to owning the first season as soon as it became available. This show has many interesting elements to it besides the horror story each week. There is a lot of emotion, and Jenson and Jared act out brotherhood wonderfully! I could really buy that they are brothers! The extras on this set are great, I especially like A Day in the Life of Jenson and Jared, and their commentary for Phantom Traveler. I reccomend this show to anyone who enjoys action, comedy, angst, and brotherly love.

B000HIVO64|4.0|Beck returns with his shortest interval between albums and \\"The Information\\". Just 18 months after the excellent \\"Guero\\", \\"The Information\\" is seemingly a more muted affair. Long in terms of 15 tracks and 60 minutes of music, and rather less adventurous than \\"Guero\\". Still, Beck tends to get more things right than wrong and there are a plethora of songs that are above average with only one song truly standing out from the rest--\\"Cell Phone's Dead\\", which should be the next single. \\"Nausea\\" is also good, along with \\"Think I'm In Love\\", \\"Soldier Jane\\", \\"New Round\\", \\"Dark Star\\" and \\"The Information\\".<br /><br />After repeated listens, the album is better than it first seemed, but at 60 plus minutes it's a strain to make to the end in one sitting.<br /><br />The art concept consisting of stickers to make your own album art is brilliant. The extra dvd with videos for all the songs on \\"The Information\\" is an added bonus with hits and misses.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Information\\" is informative, but not as useful as \\"Guero\\" or \\"Odelay\\".

B000I5X81A|4.0|JJ Cale and Eric Clapton are an intriguing team - as JJ wrote and recorded a couple of songs that later became huge commercial succeses for Eric Clapton (After Midnight and Cocaine).  Actually, comparing the JJ Cale vs the Eric Clapton versions of these two songs shows the similarities of the versions - not their differences - to be particularly striking.  Eric primarily brought his celebrity to these tunes - which helped some great music get exposed to a broader market. <br /> <br />Not surprisingly, at first listen TrtEscondido sounds a lot like a number of JJ Cale albums - many of the tracks showing JJ's characteristic laid-back shuffle, with a comfortable bluesy feel through-out.  A closer listen though underscores some subtle collaborative synergy not apparent in Eric's covers of JJ's earlier work.  Much of the unique feel of this collaboration is found in the contrasting vocal work of these two artists. <br /> <br />I was amazed by how similar, yet complimentary, the vocal stylings are of JJ and Eric.  A real treat on this collection is the track \\"Missing Person\\" where they trade off the verses and join at the chorus for a fabulous duet - voices that sound like they were meant to sing together.  And yes - of course the instrumental break doesn't disappoint - as these two masters creatively tag team rifs dissipating into some inspired keyboard work before the final chorus. <br /> <br />This probably isn't the best album in the catalog of either of these artists.  It is, however, a very tasty collaboration of two extremely talented musicians who clearly respect and appreciate each other's delightfully complimentary talents.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|I've had the old Caroline CD of \\"Pawn Hearts\\" in my collection for easily five years. I'd put it in the player once in a while trying to get into it, but it just never clicked. Then a few weeks ago, I decided to pick up \\"H to He, Who Am the Only One,\\" figuring maybe I just needed to hear some other VdGG material first, to ease my way into this challenging album. It seemed to do the trick ... because when I went back to \\"Pawn Hearts,\\" all of its layers of brilliance suddenly started to reveal themselves. It kind of felt like cracking a Zen koan that you've been meditating on for years. The release from finally \\"getting it\\" was incredibly exhilarating, and some two weeks later, I can't stop playing this amazing work from the early '70s.<br /><br />I share that little story to encourage you not to write off this album if you, too, don't get it the first time around -- or even the 10th time around! Even by prog-rock standards, it's not easily accessible. It makes some parts of \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" seem lightweight by comparison! But stick with it, because eventually, you'll be richly rewarded.<br /><br />I've heard VdGG's early music referred to as \\"jagged.\\" That's a pretty good description for a lot of what you'll hear here. There are some light and transcendently beautiful moments, including some absolutely irresistible vocal melodies from Peter Hammill, but most of the record will probably remind you of the harsh, manic, claustrophobic cacophony of King Crimson's \\"Lizard\\" album, with all of its demented jazziness, twittering percussion, and honking woodwinds. Add in some prominent keyboard work that calls to mind both Deep Purple (the heavy, grinding organ work) and McDonald & Giles (no joke -- you'll hear swatches on here that call to mind the \\"Suite in C\\" piano and the \\"Birdman\\" organ), and you've got a fairly good handle on what to expect.<br /><br />I know that Peter Hammill is a rather polarizing artist. Me? I take his voice as just another very quirky instrument in an already bizarre band. And I simply can't imagine this music without his voice over the top of it. But are the lyrics really the profoundly penetrating blasts of human-condition poetry that Hammill's hardcore fans say they are? Well, I can say that I do find a certain level of genuine emotional depth here that I don't hear in a lot of other prog bands from this era. Ian Anderson was sarcastic and cynical; Peter Gabriel was spinning Victorian fantasies; Jon Anderson was lost in the mystical ether; Peter Sinfield was a flower child. Hammill, meanwhile, was certainly earnest and serious about what he had to say, and he seemed to focus more on existential Everyman concerns -- rather like Roger Waters, but not as acerbic, and certainly more varied than Waters' well-worn themes of madness and war. Where Waters seemed to draw from Syd Barrett and his father's death as lyrical reference points over and over, Hammill isn't so insular -- the entire human race and its trials and tribulations are the canvas on which he paints. And he does it all in a theatrical, nearly operatic delivery, with his voice sliding seamlessly from piercing choir-boy heights to exasperated growls and lots of unpredictable points in between. He has a very pronounced and distinctive vibrato, a polished falsetto that only Freddie Mercury could rival in the world of rock, and an unbelievable amount of control over his delivery. You'd expect a few clinkers with these kinds of vocal acrobatics, but he seems to hit the notes perfectly every time. Even more intriguing, there are a few points near the end of \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" where he strongly conjures up the stylings of David Bowie and \\"After the Gold Rush\\"-era Neil Young. Pretty amazing.<br /><br />There's not a weak track among the three here. \\"Lighthouse Keepers\\" will probably take you the longest to penetrate, just because there's so much going on. Sometimes, the music seems to be on the verge of flying out of control, and before you know it, it's been reined back in and ready to fly off somwhere else. The whole thing pretty much teeters on the edge of chaos. To top off the perversity of it all, the piece builds up at the end rather majestically en route to a musical resolution, to give us a much-needed release from our 23-minute journey, but instead of the resolving chord your ears expect, the band goes slightly off-kilter at the very last minute. Jarring and jagged, just like the rest of this incredible album. You never know what to expect next; the music keeps messing with your expectations. That's a good indication that we're dealing with some masterful and very brave musicians here. Had this band received more popular acclaim in its day, it might not have been as willing -- or able -- to take so many musical chances. So maybe its relative obscurity was a blessing in disguise -- it meant the band never had to compromise what it did. And that was to every listener's benefit.<br /><br />Whatever you do, get this remastered version of the CD. The bonus tracks are so-so, but the three songs that make up the original album sound light-years better than they did on the Caroline disc. This version brings out lots and lots of nuances that were hidden before -- luscious details that make this music all the more deep, rich, challenging, and ultimately very satisfying.reined back in and ready to fly off somwhere else.

B000H4JGH2|5.0|So..Variety you want..you got it..this DVD is packed with new & old..some songs we have on other DVD's ..not to worry..they are in a different venue.Be sure to take your phone off the hook while watching & listening to \\"Roses From the South\\" as it is hard to talk with your heart in your throat. The Platin Tenors are here again, with his 3 Sopranos plus some new guests making for a most memorable concert. Done in Vienna, this would be nominated for \\"best effects' if there was one. As always \\"my\\" Carmen(indulge me in my 1 fantasy)does track 17 like only she can..bringing out the best in her voice. The audience & orchestra have a lot of fun with some of the pieces, there is ice dancing, ballromm dancing..making this DVD one of his best for variety. Half way through watching this I put away the track listing as I did not want to know when it ended.I could find nothing negative to say... <br />When it finished..without even thinking about it..5 stars..outstanding.

B000FA57RG|5.0|It's about time Madonna released a concert on CD.  NOW get smart, make another 50 million and release Ciao Italia on CD, Blonde Ambition on DVD, Girlie Show on CD, and Drowned World on CD.  I and millions of others have been waiting for years for this to happen!
B0000631QG|3.0|Chris T.'s review of this disc actually put the whole thing together for me...I couldn't have said it any better. For whatever it's worth, though, I'll add this.<br /><br />I'm a recent convert to the Tree and have been absolutely off the chain NUTS for their music for the last 2½ months. I've been listening to little else since being turned on to them and haven't been this bonked-out by a band since first hearing the music of YES in mid-1971. I now own 6 PT discs and, God willing, will eventually own all of them. They are that good. I'm telling anyone I think would be interested about their music (as well as Steve Wilson's side project, Blackfield.) I tell people that comparisons to Pink Floyd are valid, and that they are, for me, THE progressive rock band of the new millennium. If prog rock hangers-on like Yes, Tull, Floyd & King Crimson are soon to permanently lay down their banners, then we will be fortunate indeed to have PT around to carry on in their stead (and--going by what little I've heard from them so far--Glass Hammer and IQ).<br /><br />All of this being said, I think I was drawn to purchase METANOIA (from a 3rd-party seller who, thankfully, sold it for a very reasonable price) from what I'd heard about it: that it consisted of long instrumental improvisations, something that for the most part I've always liked about what we know as progressive rock; having heard PT's instrumental forays from other discs, I thought this one was worth a look into. And, as I mentioned earlier, Chris's review of the material pretty much sums up how I reacted to it as well. The way I'd put it is this: If you're a fan of what is arguably George Harrison's greatest album, ALL THINGS MUST PASS--and you like the Apple Jams sessions from that album--then you'll be best equipped to appreciate what PT is attempting on METANOIA. If you enjoy the quality of musicianship they all possess, then this can make for nice background listening, not to be taken too seriously (especially the intentionally-silly disc closer, \\"Milan,\\" which has the boys in an Italian restaurant, perusing the menu...reminds me of kind of a half-baked attempt at a Monty Python moment). In conclusion, it comes to this: METANOIA's basically a disc for PT completists. It's not a piece of tripe, but not one you'd want to necessarily want to waste large amounts of time and money in the pursuit of. The sticker on the disc's shrink wrap included the sardonic line, \\"File under self-indulgent.\\" If that comment came with the band's blessing, it sounds as if they're in agreement with us.ly the intentionally-silly disc closer, \\"Milan,\\" which has the boys in an Italian restaurant, perusing the menu...reminds me of kind of a half-baked attempt at a Monty Python moment).

B000069I1H|5.0|I found this movie to be simply fantastic! Personally I think I am a very very tough critic....Am shocked that so many find the film so-so...... De Niro was his same ole same ole outstanding. Eddie Murphy was sometimes a little wierd, but overall as the sidekick was excellent. Rene Russo had a few zzzzzzzzzoring sceens, but again like all other cast, really made the film enjoyable, START TO FINISH!!!!!!!!!!!  I give it a solid 8 outta 10, Heck I even bought the soundtrack I like it so much....Cheers Vintage Man in California
B000AYEL6U|5.0|A young woman moves from the country to a factory town in the 1800's. The factory, the only job in town; management vs. the union, when times get harder. The young woman wishes to help the poor. The young man, factory-owner to keep his business profitable. How will they come together? Protection of others vs. misguided compassion.

0618551050|5.0|This is my first reading from Lee Smolin and in my view he clearly and intuitively provides an account of the last 35 years of efforts behind development of String Theory.     I liked his narrative and I am aware a lot of physicist vested in models of String Theories that find this book as not balanced but an attack, refer to Joe Polchinski's comments and counter comments! That was very eye opening as scientists are like politicians, they do get angry! This is the hard problem I find to understand that so many of our scientific thinkers are insistent on what they think, this applies to both Smolin front and the others. I may also say that there is a chasm between how nature works and how we are able to understand it, it doesn't matter the field of inquiry is in fluid turbulence or the landscape of strong models, it's the same mental challenge.     While this book has caused a lot of bad feelings as much as I know but it did lead me to a lot of bright thinkers, people like David Finkelstein, Julian Barbour, and others.     I have read all popular science works of Smolin, I like the man for his passion and I found it very interesting when despite all the apparent academic challenges to seek his own type of pursuing science, he happens to meet with indirect catalysts like Lazaridis, the person who opened the way for the talent pool of Perimeter Institute. People like Smolin and Lazaridis are needed to make a difference.     It turns out that a lot of people are interested in deep questions of physics, definitely all the brilliant minds behind development of string theories are onto something. I'm not sure what to make of this book, it's a good help to get informed and to me its focus is more of social aspects of supporting scientific inquiries, unfortunately the latter has also been criticized.     As Roger Penrose said, reader is invited to do her/his study and form an opinion, that's the most balanced type of comments I can think of...    Alireza

B000001DYA|5.0|This is indeed the album that gave birth to metal music and, in my mind, has never been equaled, except perhaps by their own follow-up, \\"[[ASIN:B000001DY9 Outsideinside]].\\" I bought this one when it first came out and never tired of it. Along with [[ASIN:B00004U8DR The Doors]], Arthur Brown (\\"[[ASIN:B000006V2F The Crazy World of Arthur Brown]]\\"), [[ASIN:B000000DP9 Moby Grape]], and a few others, this album defines the initiation of 60s \\"post-Beatles\\" rock music. Blue Cheer kicked butt and they kept their music uncomplicated. Unlike the other bands of the time (especially Brits like The Who and Led Zeppelin), Blue Cheer were ahead of their time in dealing out a deceptively simple, industrial-strength wall of sound. \\"Vincebus Eruptum\\" contains a two classics that should never fade away: \\"Parchment Farm,\\" which many of us had first heard sung by Mose Allison, though in a very different style; and, of course, \\"Summertime Blues\\" was a classic of the late 50s, but notched up quite a lot on this album. At just six songs, there's no wasted space here; this is concise Blue Cheer at their best, not unlike the Doors first album, which they never really surpassed. If you'd like to hear the Mother of Metal, get this and give it a good, loud listen.

B000HEWEJO|4.0|First, the good news; yes, the newest edition of this Yule tide classic has been given an amazing restoration, and nicely blows the socks off of the older Republic DVD.<br /><br />I've never seen this, or pretty much any picture for that matter, look so crisp and clean, with no dust specs, scratches or artefacts to be had at all.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, the amazing picture quality comes with a rather annoying price, as there are 4 very loud audio pops, to be heard coming from the left hand speaker, through out the picture at the:<br /><br />1. 7 minutes and 43 second mark<br /><br />2. 57 minute and 9 second mark<br /><br />3. 1 hour, 24 minutes and 46 second mark<br /><br />4. 1 hour, 31 minutes and 43 second mark<br /><br />NOTE: (This may very a second or two either way, depending on the accuracy of your DVD player's counter, and also may not be as noticeable when played through your TV speakers alone, as I was listening to the sound through a 2 channel stereo speaker set up)<br /><br />I tried another copy but it too had the audio pops, so it's the DVD master and not just a bad disc.<br /><br />I also checked out the same spot on the old Republic DVD where the first audio pop occurs, but there's no audio pop or problem of any kind in, or around, that area.<br /><br />I've made an attempt to contact Paramount through the web site posted on the back of the new DVD's cover, but was unable to get the, \\"Contact Us\\" link to do anything.<br /><br />I'd like to find out if this is going to be fixed, or if we're stuck with it as is (as most DVD glitches, when enough people hound the studio about it, get fixed eventually, but in most cases, nothing is mentioned to the general public, and it's only by bugging them yourself, do you find this out).<br /><br />Case in point, the Back To The Future DVD set.<br /><br />In the original first run for the widescreen discs, the second and third movie was matted wrong, thus cutting off too much of the bottom of the picture and leaving too much of the top part of the picture visible.<br /><br />At first the studio wasn't going to fix the problem, but after enough noise was made, the studio relented and made replacement discs, but the catch was that no official notice was given, and unless you contacted them, then you never got the replacement discs.<br /><br />Let's just hope that this problem is fixed the, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" DVD, as this movie deserves it.re and leaving too much of the top part of the picture visible. <br /> <br />At first the studio wasn't going to fix the problem, but after enough noise was made, the studio relented and made replacement discs, but the catch was that no official notice was given, and unless you contacted them, then you never got the replacement discs. <br /> <br />Let's just hope that this problem is fixed the, \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" DVD, as this movie deserves it.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|V is a scarred man who has a vendetta against a fictional totalitarian government because they did some wicked experiments on him and other captives. You see how crafty and deadly he has become in his attacks on government property, and you see how he slowly warps Natalie Portman's mind over the course of the film by convincing her that his cause his just and his approach is justified.    The movie is well done, and the acting is phenomenal, especially the guy who plays V. This is a film that gets under your skin, a movie that sticks with you days after your first viewing.

0743289412|4.0|It has been two years.   <br />  <br />Lisey's memories of life with her writer husband Scott are refusing, stubbornly, to go quietly into the night.  Her brilliant, frustrating love knew her so well and Lisey is spooked to realize how much Scott must have anticipated future events that his wife was yet to sadly experience.  It has been no small task to comb through the mountains of Scott Landon's unfinished works but the world is out there, impatiently, waiting for some last post-humous thrills from their favourite writer.  Some souls are more impatient for Mrs Landon to get a wriggle on with it than others; as it turns out, frighteningly and violently so. <br />  <br />Little Lisey already knows that the term \\"dysfunctional\\" when used to describe her family has no small meaning, but it is a mild description to apply to what she knows her husband experienced as a small boy.  Scott had a place he visited called \\"Booya Moon\\" where wounds were healed and minds refreshed and in his own instance, was then able to go and then write and create magnificent stories. In the present day Lisey's eldest sister Amanda has once again gone to some place in her head where no one can reach her.  Things are a happenin' and Lisey just KNOWS that Scott has a plan on how to get her through them.  Only this great \\"bool\\" hunt was devised by Scott for his Lisey long before his death. <br />  <br />You can only hope that LISEY'S STORY manages to be a breakthrough novel for Stephen King and that all possible accolades are heaped upon him. The man may be creating a best seller every time he puts out a novel - but is he a GOOD writer?  Is he worthy?  If the success in writing fiction is judged by the ability to entertain, then King is a roaring success every time and is here, once again. <br />  <br />LISEY'S STORY dances lightly alongside what we so far know Stephen King and what has so far driven him always onwards in his long career.  Scott Landon may be a Pulitzer Prize winning novelist but he only considers himself a success for as long as his fans love him, and are involved with him.  This book could be described as a love story not only for the continued link beyond death between husband and wife, but also as an ode to the craft or creative writing itself.  The genuine awe that the writer seems to hold for the great pool in which his ideas could come from (not solely his domain, but a metaphoric reference) is given centre stage in LISEY'S STORY and is supported by the character's ability to renew and regenerate when in this other world, a world that it its manifestation is not the sole property of one Scott Landon. <br />  <br />You have to get in the rhythm of husband-and-wife speak in this novel which seems to be irritating a lot of readers, but in truth that's how couples are and this is just one person's take on that.  This book is almost a one room drama but as it flips between Scott's past, Scott and Lisey's shared past, and Lisey's present etc you're expected to pick the crumbs King liberally scatters about in order to read the whole of the human drama.  King's trademark melancholic sweetness, as you would expect, is applied with a more liberal hand in LISEY'S STORY.  The reader may wish for Lisey to get a hurry on as she ponders what to do, what to do, but the promised reward is there on conclusion.  Some of it may come to you after the book has been shut. <br />
B000HT3PPG|5.0|It's not until you are well and truly wading through the wealth of special features on the 2-disc special edition DVD of the 1947 Christmas favorite \\"The Miracle on 34th Street\\" that one realizes that the release features not just two versions of the movie, but three.<br />For not only does the release feature the original black & white version shown in theaters and the circa 1980s colorized version of the same feature film, but also hidden away on the second disc is the curiously titled \\"20th Century Fox Hour of the Stars: The Miracle on 34th Street,\\" which turns out to be a 46 minute 1950s remake for television that is surprisingly in incredibly good quality.<br />The inclusion of this feature is indicative of Fox's loving tribute to this family movie gem that is this 2-disc release. Prior to its release the studio had no idea how to market what it considered to be an \\"unimportant program picture\\" and stuck it in the middle of its summer schedule with a trailer (shown here as a 5-minute promotional short) that did not feature one single clip from the movie and went at lengths to conceal it's Yuletide theme.<br />The story is so well known that it hardly bears relating in this review. Suffice to say that it charts the efforts of a man (played in an Academy Award winning performance by British actor Edmund Gwenn) to be legally recognized as Santa Claus, which in fact he is and to persuade a doubting young girl (played by Natalie Wood in a star-turning performance) and a practical realist (played by Maureen O'Hara) that he is indeed Father Christmas. Picked to replace a liquor induced Santa as the Macy's Parade Santa he is a smashing success and indeed Gwenn's performance is so incredible that Natalie Wood really did believe that she was acting opposite Santa Claus.<br />Perhaps the best special feature in this release (in what is a tough choice given its incredible company) is the feature length audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Recorded at her home in Ireland this past August the DVD warns us that this is merely excerpts of that interview with frequent silent sections. But I must say that this is happily not entirely accurate. O'Hara is clearly watching the movie (discussing elements on the screen as they occur), but also is more talkative than other commentaries that I have listened to that do not have a similar warning.<br />In the commentary O'Hara recounts being forced to remain in the United States following the outbreak of hostilities in World War II and subsequently furious when (after being allowed to return to her native Ireland) on being ordered back to the U.S. to make this film. She tells us that other considered titles were \\"The Big Heart\\" and \\"It's Only Human\\" and how once she read the script she was determined to be involved in what she saw as a warm and affectionate movie. O'Hara also talks about the parade itself and reveals that it was the actual parade with people in the crowd not being aware that Fox was shooting a movie that day.<br />Also included in this release is the 22-minute \\"AMC Backstory\\" that takes us behind the scenes of the production. Including are on-camera interviews with film historian Rudy Behlmer, actress Maureen O'Hara, actor Robert Hyatt (who played Thomas Mara Jr.), actor Alvin Greenman (who played Alfred), Natalie Wood biographer Suzanne Finstad and Natalie's sister Lana Wood. The documentary traces the genesis to the movie back to a fateful trip to a Los Angeles department store by screenwriter Valentine Davies. Fighting through holiday shoppers on 1944's Christmas Eve in an effort to buy a gift for his wife, Davies wondered what Santa Claus would make of the commercialism of Christmas. After working on the screenplay for over a year the project was optioned by Fox, who evidently had no idea what they had.<br />In what was a huge risk the filmmakers agreed when Macy's and rival store Gimble Bros. said they would withold permission for their names to be used in the film until they had seen the finished film. Thankfully they loved it for if either store had objected Fox would have had to drastically re-cut and re-shoot major portions of the movie.<br />So it was that at the height of the 1946 shopping season over 100 cast and crew descended on the Macy's store in New York City to shoot interiors of the movie and when it wrapped used the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter (who were on the Fox lot shooting other pictures) to rave about the production. Fox need not have worried though because it was a critical and commercial success staying in theaters for over six months and taking home three of its nominated four Oscars. In fact its popularity is such that it has not only been remade in the included 1950s TV production, but again in a 1970s TV movie and then in a 1994 big budget production (and clips from all three are featured in the AMC Backstory).<br />An archival MovieTone News reel (running 1:42) covers those awards presentations and includes the famous quote from a clean shaven Gwenn when receiving his statue, \\"Phew. Now I know there is a Santa Claus.\\"<br />But that's not all this bumper release contains. Also included is a 15:30 featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and in particular its pivotal role in the movie. This new documentary features on-camera interviews with Robert M. Grippo (author of a book on the parade) and John W. Straus who worked on the parade for 22 years and coordinated with the studio that the filming of the parade (with their 14 camera's positioned along the route) went off without a hitch.<br />The special features are rounded out with nine posters for the movie.<br />Audio includes English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English mono, French mono and Spanish mono.

B000068IEU|5.0|Man oh man. If you took a time machine back to 1972-3 you would have a nearly impossible time finding a film quite as disturbing in its ultra-realistic portrayal of needless violent brutality as LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. While it may be true that compared to many of the 80's gore-fests and today's gore/horror films LHOTL may seem a little tame(not really though), it still packs quite a wallop even 35 years after its release. The fact is, without LHOTL we NEVER would have got I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK, NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS, MOTHER'S DAY, LAST HOUSE ON DEAD-END STREET, CANNIBAL MAN, MANIAC, HENRY:PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, MAN BITES DOG and countless other examples of modern horror realism in filmaking. LHOTL paved the way for horror films concerning simply, violence. It was one of the first films to truly represent the depravity of post-World War II American society and the killers who helped to define the violence of the latter-20th century. When you combine this historical context, with the fact that this classic film was made by near-amatuers on a LOW budget, it's hard to deny the legend and terrible allure of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Put yourself in the mindset of a theatre-goer seeing the film in 1972 and I DEFY you to downplay this film's power! If you consider yourself a TRUE Horror fanatic and haven't yet seen this film, pick it up immediately! You won't be disappointed.
B000AOEMXM|2.0|I'm a fan of this show. I never missed an ep. This price, however, is so high it's offensive. What in the world are they thinking? <br /> <br />About the show: <br />It had a lot of promise. They had good actors, an established 'universe' to play with, good special-effects budgets, a decent time-slot, and a crew that had been putting out quality shows for years. They did not, however, have a crack team of writers. Some were good, but on the whole, the writing was flat, the stories were predictable, the character arcs belabored and inconsistent, and -- the worst thing television writing can be -- boring. In short, they weren't good story-tellers. <br /> <br />It was very disheartening having to see such a talented ensemble of actors being given such asinine things to do. I understand that sex sells and showing skin is considered by some to be a legitimate plot device, but how many \\"suntan lotion\\" decon-chamber scenes can one series have before it's done to death?? If you're going to play the 'sexual tension' angle, at least be clever about it. I felt like the writers assumed we were all fifteen year old boys. <br /> <br />If the series had not been driven into the ground by poor writing and lack of focus, it could've been one of the best shows on television. (It would also still be on the air instead of being ignominiously canceled after four seasons.) Manny Coto finally came on board in the fourth season in a last-ditch effort to pull everything together and put out a good show, one that actually lived up to its promise. He managed to almost single-handedly lift it out of the mire. Unfortunately, just when things were improving, the network decided enough was enough and canned the show.  <br /> <br />If you decide to purchase, I'd recommend buying the fourth season only. $480-something dollars is way, way too much for anything less than a classic series, and sadly, this series does not fall into that category.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|Religious and artists' lives have not fared particularly well in films, both being more interior than outwardly evident.  Fred Zinnemann's The Nun's Story is the exception, certainly in American films, as it charts the life of Gabrielle Van Der Mal, who becomes Sister Luke, a nursing nun in Belgium and later in the Congo. Her gradual alienation from the religious life to one more secular is brilliantly conceived. This is achieved in Zinnemann's stately direction but also in the Robert Anderson script, drawn from Kathryn Hulme's book. <br /> <br />There will probably never again be a cast of women as extraordinary as here. Audrey Hepburn had the finest role of her career as Sister Luke. Add Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft, Mildred Dunnock, Colleen Dewhurst, Beatrice Straight and Ruth White, all giving exceptional performances. Lastly, Peter Finch's role here as Dr. Fortunati, put him on the international map and began a string of fine performances for the rest of his career. This is essential viewing for those interested in how Hollywood once produced fine and intelligent work.
B000J3FC0Q|5.0|What a wonderful record! Amy Winehouse's 2nd release \\"Back to Black\\" confirms her as a major talent for the millenium. BtB is a straightforward album that plays from start to finsih. Each track is a gem of retro style and modern sensibilities. Amy and her producers cleverly mine a wealth of sixties pop and soul styles with references from classic motown, to doowop and to Brill building style NYC pop (think Phil Spector), hitting everything spot-on. She knows her musical history and employs this knowledge to convey modern hipster sensibilities. Songs are filled with stories of love gone bad, twisted romances, a predilection for hard living - smoking weed and hard drinking. Amy's no shrinking violet - she's a woman with an attitude and an in-your-face point of view. Let's me not fail to mention the quality of her vocals - she gives outstanding vocal performances throughout the 35 minute disc. Each song, turn of phrase, vocal affectation compell you to listen closely and to feel what she's saying. At 35 minutes, I wished the album was longer but she keeps it real and leaves you wanting more. If you like music beyond the formulaic and with personality this is a must have. Hopefully there will be a stateside release and you won't have to pay the $35 bucks Amazon is asking. It is worth it though.  Amy Amy Amy!
0805066349|5.0|I use to think Andrew Jackson was such a Great Man and leader of the American People and that the United States Government was the wisest and most powerful government in the world.  That is until I read this book back in the early 1970's.  The way I looked at this country and it's leaders was turned around from then on in my life.  I had already gone through the period where John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Martin Luther King were assassinated right on TV for the whole world to see, in broad daylight.  And then the cover ups!  And the American people bought into the lies, the deceit, that was told to us, hook, line, and sinker.  I had already done research on the Kennedy assassination and knew that it was a cover up. Lone assassin my butt!  So, when I read this book by Dee Brown the flood lights came on.  Watching TV as a little boy the \\"Red Savages\\" were always the bad guys and those programs were made to brainwash the American people into believing that lie as well.  And we did.  Until Dee Brown released this book.  The murderous atrocities, stealing their land for gold, rapes of young boys, women and men by United States Soldiers, were all allowed and committed by this white washed United States Government then and now, YES NOW, towards Native Americans should be put on trial and a shakedown of this so called Government \\"for the people\\" should be the least we as Americans should do.  But most Americans watch the six o' clock evening news and that is the only gospel they will ever know or believe.  Of course white America made excuses and perpetuated lies to try and discredit Dee Brown and the truth that was told in the pages of this explosive book, over 30 years ago now.  But, after selling 5 million copies and still climbing, it has stood the test of time and it's opposers.  If you never read another book besides this one, as long as you live, this should be the book.  You say, quit complaining and what can be done about it?  I just did, I wrote it down and youjust read it and you now know how to find out more by buying this book.
0553212737|5.0|Of all of Jane Austen's books, this one certainly gets my vote for the best. I loved it because I could relate to the character of Emma. No, she isnt perfect, but her flaws are part of what makes her so real. While the Bennett women were certainly by no means perfect either (the crazy mother immediately took away any hopes of that), they always seemed rather flat to me. Emma is witty and charming, but with a degree of authenticity that makes her seem less like a character in a novel, and more like your best friend. highly recommend.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money. <br />This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.  <br />This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge. <br />Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll shouldenjoy them.
0802130208|5.0|Without a doubt, this is my all time favorite book and at nearly 60 years old I have read many. Ignatius J. Reilly is such a crotchety guy that nurturer that I am, I want to give him a big hug and the unconditional love that might help him enjoy life. On the other hand, I can hardly read fast enough to satisfy my fiendish curiosity for what he will say and do next. This book makes me laugh out loud at Ignatius's tormented \\"worldview\\" but also makes me sad (I am prone to melancholy by nature)realizing there has to be part of Ignatius in the author John Kennedy Toole. As most readers probably know, Mr. Toole committed suicide at age 33 after trying unsuccessfully to have this book published.  <br /> <br />I am delighted this book received the Pulitzer Prize. My son and his wife are expecting a son in two months. Since my son feels the same way I do about A CoD, my grandson's name will be Milo \\"Ignatius\\". I couldn't be happier...well, maybe Milo Ignatius J. Reilly would be cool! <br /> <br />My suggestion to those who have not read this book is get up from the computer right now and head out to your favorite bookstore. Or do as I do and stay seated on your tush and order from Amazon. Regardless of how you acquire it, start on this delightful novel. I can assure you, you will not regret it.
B000I5X81K|2.0|Hyperbole is a fool's tool, but I am dumbstruck at the hosannas bestowed upon this latest release from this pseudo-classical popera artist.  I'm sure he's a nice enough boy, but as he jettisons toward each next high note, it signifies nothing, really.  Granted, this new discharge is a leap ahead of his previous turgidly droning releases - I'd wish he'd forgo his awkward use of a multilingual erudition altogether - but he and his ilk remain a philter for the wishful thinking, and a gallimaufry of clich&eacute;'s for the rest of us.  Perfect voice for a Christmas Collection, though.  My grade:  B-

I have seen Dream Theater live when they came to Monterrey, Mexico, and I was amazed by the talent these musicians have.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|It is hard to come across a soundtrack that completely captures the essence of a book or movie. This one, however, is an exception. The music from this soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and simply beautiful. There are a variety of songs on it, too. There are the soft piano and orchestra pieces such as \\"Dawn\\", \\"Liz on Top of the World\\", and \\"The Secret Life of Daydreams\\". There is also period music like \\"Meryton Townhall\\", \\"Can't Slow Down\\", \\"A Postcard to Henry Purcell\\", and \\"Another Dance\\". Other songs (\\"Stars and Butterflies\\", \\"The Living Sculptures of Pemberley\\", \\"Georgiana\\", \\"Arrival to Netherfield\\", \\"Leaving Netherfield\\", \\"Darcy's Letter\\", \\"Your Hands Are Cold\\", \\"Mrs. Darcy\\", and \\"End Credits\\") are equally excellent, and bring you deep into the world of Pride and Prejudice. The entire soundtrack of Pride and Prejudice can be enjoyed of the movie, the book, or those who have no affiliation with either.
0451191153|3.0|Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead\\" is seen in hindsight as one of the more influential American novels of the 20th century. It espouses the cause of the gifted and unique individual against the forces of conformity, be those political ideologies or the attempt within interest groups and professions to promote consensual mediocrity over genius. It also espouses capitalism naked in tooth and claw against any form of collectivism. This philosophy has thrived in post-Carter America. The book itself is poorly written because it overstresses the polemic, with many stretches equivalent to the speech-to-camera technique on film, This is all too common in novels striving to put over a message. The characters are cardboard cutouts. In this I find the book similar to another pioneering work, Radclyffe Hall's \\"The Well of Loneliness\\". If the central topic of that work had not been lesbianism, but heterosexual love, the book would be long forgotten, as the prose rarely rises above the level of Peg's Paper or Mills & Boon. Certainly, after \\"The Fountainhead\\" I have never been tempted towards \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", though I share most of the ongoing aims of the Ayn Rand Institute.

B000GY729M|4.0|Some albums are an acquired taste that take a couple of spins to appreciate. Not so with SAM'S TOWN.<br /><br />The sounds on the albums are eclectic and fresh. I felt like that band took each song in a new direction. None of them felt recycled or tacked on. I was surprised as I listened to it how different one song was from the next. This made for an exciting listen that will provide a lot of replay value.<br /><br />The runtime of the album is just under 45 minutes. It seemed a little short to me - though I have no idea what the average runtime of a record is. Actually, I was surprised when the CD was over. Usually, even on some of my favorite albums, I have to skip a couple of songs that are just filler. I did no such thing here, so the concise runtime is a credit to the \\"all killer (pun definitely intended) no filler\\" catch-phrase. I'm happier with an album that delivers throughout even if it is less lengthy than comparable releases.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'm glad to say, SAM'S TOWN is a worthy follow-up to HOT FUSS, and hopefully means that the Killers are here to stay.<br /><br />Buy this album.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Honestly, I was expecting a rehash of Muse's last album, Absolution.  What I got was very different, and despite really liking Absolution, I couldn't be happier.  This album just keeps you on your toes, switching from one music genre to another not just from track to track but oftentimes verse to verse while somehow maintaining a coherent sound.  And although many of these genres would make me retch individually, I can't seem to get enough of Muse's interpretation.  And then after you finally get over the music itself, you discover the lyrics.  And of course the vocals are always top-notch.  I can't recommend this album enough.

B000002AH9|5.0|LADY IN SATIN is indeed one of the most heartwrenching recordings one can listen to.  Billie Holiday is at her finest moment, and unfortunately it was her last.  As one reads the album's liner notes, Billie declaringly states, \\"I've got to sing with Ellis,\\" Lady said, \\"I want this album more than anything else, and I want it to be good.\\" This was Billie's favorite record, and undoubtedly so, she gave her heart and soul in producing a record that will leave a lasting impression on any listener.  The initial 12 tracks on the album will will definitely hit the gut.  The remaining four bonus tracks and alternate takes offer a little revealing glimpse of what Billie was like during the recording session.<br /><br />Overall, Billie finely stands alone backed by Ray Ellis' lush orchestration.  This is not muzak, but a great collection of tracks done by one of jazz music's quintessential female vocalists. One will hear the sound of Billie's singing with its strength and agility despite the somewhat somber lyrics in songs, such as \\"I'm A Fool To Want You,\\" \\"You Don't Know What Love Is,\\" and \\"I'll Be Around.\\"  Indeed, this record is a true depiction of the torchsong singer.<br /><br />Every genre of music experiences a period of progression.  LADY IN SATIN was recorded in 1958, and amidst the changing face of popular music, Rock and Roll took over the airwaves, popular jazz music moved into a different direction than when \\"Lady Day\\" originally burst onto the jazz music scene over 20 years earlier, the record has stood the test of time, but with an inkling of historical irony and atomsphere.  Indeed, this recording is Billie's best effort, and many may criticize her vocals, but by listening to the songs, it has aged like a fine wine for someone who literally tasted the fringes of life.

B00005JPC4|5.0|This is one of those movies where Ridley Scott is in a mellow mood; and--despite my often-stated admiration for the man--this is yet another bit of proof, if any such were needed, that the man is a hopeless romantic. Though it's been said, and will be said again, that the 'real' main character of the movie is the Provencal, I can't see it. Ever since The Duellists, his first feature film, Scott has paid close attention to 'setting' as a creator of mood, sometimes with a painstaking and exquisite artistry that has few peers in the movie universe. Just because he does this, does not imply that the backdrop is what the flick is 'all about'. It's just the typical Ridley Scott care and attention lavished on the details of visuals and their importance. Still, as always, at the center are the characters.<br /><br />A Good Year is almost free of serious 'conflict'; and its rhythms, pacing and story-development goes against just about everything the gurus of screenwriting will preach. But is is seriously filled with choices, decisions and how we must needs live with them and their consequences. About how we drift into all sorts of directions because of who and what we are--and how maybe that's not what we really wanted, even though we turned out to be good and successful at it--and how, while still remaining essentially true to oneself and quite without needing to undergo terrible soul-searching and upheavals or even a 'change of character', it is possible to figure out better ways of using those same attributes to make decisions that are more mature, wise, authentic and ultimately fulfilling.<br /><br />Russel Crowe plays a role that must surely come naturally to him, and especially under the direction of someone he trusts. He is a rogue; a naughty boy--who always was a naughty boy, even in his young incarnation (played beautifully by Freddy Highmore), and lost his way for a while and forgot a lot of things. Fate intervenes and serves to remind him of stuff he'd closeted away; including, yes of course, 'the girl'. In the end, it's not about a matter of terrible situations and inescapable dilemmas, but about simple decisions about what matters and what doesn't and why--made by someone who has become wise/canny/mature enough to be able to tell the difference.<br /><br />Crowe obviously enjoys playing the naughty boy who enjoys being a naughty boy, and it comes across with a natural ease that makes him charming even when he addresses the underlings in his office as 'lab rats'. He's a rogue at the start and he's still a rogue at the end. You don't necessarily _have to_ change what you are, even if you're not perfect, in order to figure out what's what. And this 'what's what' is very much like Ridley Scott.<br /><br />I haven't read Peter Mayle's book, and have no need to. The movie itself is sufficient for me. As I expect from a RS flick, there's more subtle meaning, content and just sheer richness and substance in most scenes than other directors pack into their whole deep-and-meaningful movies.<br /><br />So, I'm a fan of Ridley Scott.

B0000VD04M|3.0|In this charming and thoroughly entertaining film director Tim Burton takes us inside the very twisted world of proclaimed worst director ever Ed Wood. It is not so much as a sad story (Wood wouldn't want your tears, you can take or leave his films, it makes no difference to him) as it is a pathetic story. Sure we watch and laugh as he gives it his all to create his significantly bad films, but we also shake our heads and feel bad for these people. Didn't they realize what they were making? Much of our time is spent exploring the relationship between Wood and Bela Lugosi. Martin Landau plays Lugosi the same way he played Bob Ryan on \\"Entourage,\\" as a washed up has been who has no idea that the world has passed him by. Lugosi, having been thrown out of Hollywood like a piece of trash, is picked up by Burton who views him as his ticket to the director's chair. The plan works perfectly which is great news for Wood and not so great news for everybody else. Under Wood, Lugosi is turned into little more than a circus freak. Wood is under the impression that he is reviving his career, but in reality he is just coming dangerously close to destroying his legacy.<br /><br />Ed Wood is not unlike our current movie phenom de jour Borat. Both are completely out to lunch and could not be more enthusiastic about it. Also, he is going to do things his way and nobody is going to stand in his way. You have to admit Wood was very good at turning lemons into lemonade; it is just that history has judged this lemonade to be quite bitter. If Wood didn't have enough money to finance his film, he would just sell off the leading role. If Wood didn't have enough money to pay rent, he would just barter with movie scripts and Bela Lugosi footage. Of course that move led to his set being invaded by Christians, and while they may have been making sense (in a conventional wisdom kind of way) I much preferred Wood's nonsensical approach. Burton also uses this film to discuss the idea of directorial control of a film. He uses both Wood and Orson Welles to sell the idea that directors need artistic control of their films, and I'll buy it. Producers and financers are too scared any more to make films as great as \\"Citizen Kane\\" or as awful as \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space,\\" but these are the films that people remember. Welles himself fell on tough times throughout his career but sometimes that is the price you have to pay. Everybody likes to paint \\"Heaven's Gate\\" as the reason why directors should not have complete control, but what about other current films in which the directors have had nearly all of the control such as \\"Crash,\\" \\"Fahrenheit 9-11,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Borat.\\" All of these were excellent films that took risks and challenged the audience. I'm certainly not saying that Ed Wood was known for challenging his audience (unless we're talking about endurance), but without his artistic failures we wouldn't have him to kick around all these years later. . .and thus we wouldn't have this very good film. ***1/2al control of a film.

B000HCO83Q|3.0|The X-Men series has never been my favorite. It strains itself to be profound, but rarely ever is. They have WAY too many characters and not nearly enough screen time. They are too proud of their special effects. In general, the whole series has been mishandled. That said, for a summertime popcorn blockbuster how can I really complain about \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\"? What other Hollywood film of this stripe has the nerve to point out the ugly, discriminatory practices of our government? This film follows almost the same formula as the previous two films even though the switched directors from Bryan Singer (Superman beckoned) to Brett Ratner. The X-Men battle with themselves over being mutant, and then with other mutants whose politics they disagree with. There are basically two types of scenes here, those that involve pontifications and those that involve special effects bonanzas. These scenes get woven together pretty poorly, but nobody seems to care because they're just there to catch a glimpse of their favorite X-Man perform their greatest hits.<br /><br />The government, always looking to help out their citizens, has created a cure for mutants. Better yet, they are going to force them to take it. Hey if George Bush can win an election by campaigning against homosexuals why wouldn't those same tactics work for this president? My main problem with this film is its message, assuming that I am reading it correctly. Noam Chomsky has always said that there is no use is speaking truth to power because power already knows the truth, they just don't care. So at the end we have the \\"bad\\" X-Men fighting the government trying to stop them from forcing the mutants to take the antidote. Meanwhile, the \\"good\\" X-Men are fighting the \\"bad\\" X-Men over. . .a personal matter I guess. The poster for the film says \\"Take a Stand\\" and that is what Magneto and his crew were doing. Wolverine and Co., on the other hand, seemed to be fighting for complacency. Oh well. This is one blockbuster that at least dumbs the ideas down so far that even the dumbest guy in the audience is forced to think a little.<br /><br />We can all probably agree that money is a replacement for art, and that is quite obvious in many of these scenes (the Golden Gate Bridge incident, for instance). And that's fine, I like special effects too, but it underscores a bigger problem in the movie biz. People only like special effects, so a non-stop explosion-o-rama like \\"The Marine\\" gets to play in theaters across the country, but a thoughtful, non-explosive film like \\"Half Nelson\\" is stuck in box office hell (the art house). Halle Berry shows up here to pick up the easiest pay check of her career, as does Anna Paquin (looking suddenly old, no thanks to the strands of gray in her hair). In our society the only thing that is truly accepted is to be white, rich and hetero (if you don't believe me, look at out Senate). I just don't understand why this film had the villains be the only ones who stood up to this abomination. But then again, the movie studios probably like complacency. **3/4ter that at least dumbs the ideas down so far that even the dumbest guy in the audience is forced to think a little. <br /> <br />We can all probably agree that money is a replacement for art, and that is quite obvious in many of these scenes (the Golden Gate Bridge incident, for instance).

I just don't understand why this film had the villains be the only ones who stood up to this abomination. But then again, the movie studios probably like complacency. **3/4    <br />
B000002KDO|5.0|While most critics cite Sabbath's self-named debut and \\"Paranoid\\" as this heaviest of bands' greatest work, one can't overlook the third opus that was so influential it spawned the entire Seattle grunge era and is still better than any imitation.<br /><br />  From the opening cough of \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and its heavier-than-a-coal-mine riff to the end of this too short master work, Black Sabbath was never darker, gloomier, or more frightening to anybody who disliked their brand of metal.  Ozzy's vocals - alien and unlike other \\"powerful\\" voices like Roger Daltrey or Robert Plant, fit the music perfectly.<br /><br />  Iommi's SG Gibson set the tone for gloom; sick riffs that bubble up directly from the hell blues singers warned us about with volume and distortion loud enough to invade any bible thumping preacher's dreams.<br /><br />  Perhaps the best cut on the album, \\"Children Of The Grave\\" chops through the murk with scenes of nuclear annihilation and ghostly feedback at the end only Tony Iommi could pull off.<br /><br />  \\"Master Of Reality\\" is, however, an album that must be heard in its entirety, which is not hard since it's barely over thirty minutes long.  However, that is long enough when given an aural tour through nuclear hell.  St. Vitus, the band that named itself after the song on the follow-up Sabbath album \\"Vol. 4\\", has made a career of reconstructing \\"Master Of Reality\\", such is the wealth of influence this album holds.  No metal fan can call themselves true without this one.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I did not see Cars in the theaters,but this is another great hit from Pixar. <br />It teaches a good lesson about appreciation and pay attention to the things  <br />that really matters in life. Laughs are great but lessons are better,I was looking to laugh my tail off but instead it was heart felt with a lot of love. That's what makes Pixar Unique. It's a must have especially for the all kids and adults as well.
0800141660|5.0|I admit that I hadn't given this film a whirl until now.  Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite Jane Austen novels (my two big favorites are Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion, in that order) and I cannot believe I hadn't felt compelled to watch this film.  Thank goodness for my new obsession for period pieces and film adaptations, for I might have never feasted my eyes upon such a lovely piece of work.  Emma Thompson wrote the adaptation and she did a fine job in bringing Austen's romanticism, humor and social commentary to life.  Everyone who has read the book knows this centers on the two elder Dashwood sisters -- Elinor and Marianne -- and their loss of money and good connections when their father dies and their estates are passed on to the male heir, a son from a previous marriage.  He promised his father to provide for his sisters, but is manipulated into not doing so by his conniving wife (played by Harriet Walter).  Penniless and without dowries, the girls' chances of making a good marriage become nil.  However, they are not lacking in suitors.  Elinor (Emma Thompson), the elder sister and sensible one, falls for the dashing Mr. Edward Ferrars (Hugh Grant).  Even though the affections are reciprocated, Edward is otherwise obliged to another.  Marianne (Kate Winslet) is the silly, romantic type -- always reading poems and sonnets and romanticizing a dashing hero that would sweep her off her feet.  In comes the charming Mr. John Willoughby (Greg Wise), who is the embodiment of everything Marianne desires...or is he?  Then there is Col. Christopher Brandon (Alan Rickman), a kind gentleman who would do anything for Marianne.  Will the Dashwood sisters find love in spite of their less than acceptable conditions?<br /><br />This film is a marvel.  The quality of the production is top notch.  The wardrobe brings the Georgian/Regency period to life and the scenery is gorgeous.  Every aspect of this film is awesome.  Hollywood has created some rather superficial film adaptations, but this is one of the exceptions.  Bravo for Emma Thompson for her excellent work in both writing the script and for her wonderful acting.  I agree with the reviewers who thought Thompson was too old to play a nineteen-year-old, but few actresses, regardless of age, would've portrayed Elinor with as much depth and range.  The acting in general is commendable.  I had my doubts about Hugh Grant playing Mr. Ferrars, but he handles the portrayal rather well.  The handsome Greg Wise (whom I'd seen in BBC's The Buccaneers) plays the deceivingly charming Mr. Willoughby flawlessly.  Mr. Willoughby has always reminded me of Pride and Prejudice's Mr. Wickham, but Wise was able to give the character his own voice.  Kate Winslet is my favorite in this movie as Marianne.  She portrays Marianne's youth, innocence and, at times, tactlessness with aplomb.  Alan Rickman, Gemma Jones (Mrs. Dashwood) and Imogen Stubbs (Miss Lucy Steele) are also great.  I cannot say enough good things about this film except that it is a must-have for your DVD collection, especially if you're a Jane Austen fan and lover of film adaptations and period pieces like I am.  I've heard that the BBC is making a version of Sense and Sensibility and I cannot wait to see that one as well!film adaptations, but this is one of the exceptions.

B00020HEL6|5.0|I am blown away by Renee Olstead's phrasing and voice control. She waves both around like a magic wand, weaving an incredible spell one would expect from a vocalist many decades older. The torch singers and jazz stylists from the past would gladly welcome her to their ranks after hearing her covers of \\"Summertime\\", \\"Sentimental Journey\\" and \\"What a Difference a Day Makes.\\" Not since I found Rosemary Clooney have I heard someone with such command of their use of oxygen to enhance their vocal presentation. In spite of her youth, she avoids the pitfall of singers such as Celine Dion and Michael Bolton who warbled at the tops of their lungs because they could. Olstead, either instinctively or through intense training (okay, it could be both) demonstrates the importance of restraining the power. She makes creative points in her presentations as by utilizing both ends of the awesome range of her voice.<br /><br />Plese, ma'am, may we have more?
061861169X|5.0|Chris Van Allsburg's picture book THE POLAR EXPRESS is a Christmas classic anyone can enjoy.  Both illustrations and text are wonderful and the book hits just the right magical mysterious notes with none of the creepiness the Tom Hanks movie can claim.  And the ending is pitch perfect in capturing the  spirit of Santa Claus and Christmas.

B000002KNY|5.0|Buy it, definitely. Every song is great (except Animals - I never could get into that one). It's dark, it's funny, it's artsy (in a good way), it's 100% unique, like the Talking Heads in general. Best cuts: I Zimbra; Cities; Life During Wartime; Air; Heaven (my favorite of the bunch) and Drugs. Buy it, and pick up More Songs About Buildings and Food, Remain in Light and Speaking in Tongues while you're at it.
B00005JNS0|1.0|This movie is great family entertainment.  My kids love it and I really enjoy it.  I think it says a lot about the incredible people at Pixar that THIS is probably their weakest film. <br /> <br />My major disappointment is with the DVD.  Pixar has always had great \\"Special Edition\\" DVD releases. With each film they've improved the features. They usually have close to an hour's worth of `behind the scenes' documentaries.  And they weren't released as a special edition at a later date.  <br />On Cars, it's about 15 minutes and includes NO `making of' content.  It's a good feature about John Lasseter's inspiration for the story.  <br /> <br />Usually, there are features about story development, animation techniques and other insights into the creative process that follows the years of work involved in making these films.   <br /> <br />The Incredibles had tons of  Behind the Scenes features as well as 2 commentary tracks with writers and animators, giving you over 6 hours of extra content. <br /> <br />Over these many films, I have come to know and love the creators as much or more than the films themselves. I was a lot more excited about purchasing this DVD than my kids were. <br /> <br />Pixar truly had captured the `magic' that used to be Disney Animation, even in the Walt-style `behind-the-scenes' features.  Then, Disney, who in recent years has given us `creative triumphs' such as Cinderella 2, Little Mermaid 2, Beauty and the Beast 2 and  Lion King 2 and 3, bought Pixar. <br /> <br />I don't think it's a coincidence that the first Pixar release since the Disney buyout is being sold for the same $20.00 price, with minimal content.  Disney is clearly going for bigger profits and ripping off fans of Pixar.  I certainly don't believe that Pixar would suddenly change direction and offer their fans less. <br /> <br />Disney doesn't deserve a 5 star Amazon customer rating for such a lame product. <br /> <br />You don't have to hate the movie to rate this `release' as being poor. <br /> <br />I'm personally casting this as my vote AGAINST  Nemo 2, 3 & 4 or A Bugs Life: The Grasshoppers Return!

B00005JPB4|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Whoever said \\"Truth is often the first casualty of war\\" must have had \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" in mind, the powerful new film from director Clint Eastwood that vividly juxtaposes the reality of the battlefield with the fantasy of the home front.<br /><br />The movie tells the behind-the-scenes story of the picture-seen-round-the-world, the one showing the Marines raising the American flag triumphantly on Iwo Jima.  When that photograph hit the nation's newspapers in early 1945, it provided not only a renewed feeling of hope to a nation weary of war, but a perfect PR opportunity for a government desperate to raise badly needed funds for the (pardon the pun) flagging war effort.  Even though it was little known at the time that the photo the world saw was actually of the SECOND raising of the flag (hence, the later charge that the whole thing was staged), the military pulled the three surviving men in the picture off the battlefield so that they could participate in a carefully choreographed, whirlwind tour designed to raise bond money back home.  The romantic mythology that sprang up around the event so quickly embedded itself into the American consciousness that these self-described Regular Joes achieved an instant legendary hero status that they were not prepared for psychologically.  The film explores the effect all this unlooked-for fame and publicity had on the men at the time and the way in which the label of \\"hero\\" haunted them for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Using James Bradley and Ron Powers` book as his source, scenarist Paul Haggis - whose work ranges from the sublime \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" to the godawful \\"Crash\\" - has written (with co-author William Broyles Jr.) a screenplay that deftly examines the nature of heroism and shows how truth is often sacrificed in the service of patriotism.  That is pretty heady stuff in a day and age when charges of treason or at least of not supporting the troops are carelessly hurled at people who so much as question the wisdom of a particular war-related strategy or goal.  And it is also surprising coming from a director like Eastwood, long associated with the more conservative elements in Hollywood.  Yet, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a highly patriotic film in that it implies that we honor the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform the most when we adhere to the truth and don't try to manipulate the facts to suit our own purposes, no matter how noble those purposes might be.<br /><br />The filmmakers have divided the film into three interlocking parts:  the first is a brilliantly staged war-is-hell recreation of the island battle; the second documents the bond tour; and the third involves present day interviews with the survivors reflecting back on their experiences.  Haggis and Broyles Jr. skillfully shift among the three time bands, helping us to sift out the truth from the messy mixture of fact and fiction that has always surrounded the event.  And even though the movie winds up eliciting tears from the audience in the end, it does so with a restraint and subtlety that keeps us from feeling manipulated and manhandled by the filmmakers - as we certainly did with \\"Crash,\\" when Haggis was serving as his own director.  He clearly does much better when he leaves that job to Mr. Eastwood.<br /><br />The battle scenes, which combine amazing CGI effects with sepia-toned photography, have the same stunning force as those in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  No less impressive are the performances by a large and gifted cast, including Barry Pepper, Paul Walker and John Benjamin Hickey in relatively minor roles.  As the three young men who feel unworthy of the title \\"hero,\\" Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and especially Adam Beach, as a Native American affectionately referred to as \\"Chief,\\" turn in superlative work.<br /><br />\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a moving, stirring and, above all, clear-eyed tribute to those who serve.isdom of a particular war-related strategy or goal.

B00028HBKC|1.0|Several reviewers have accurately pointed out several historical inaccuracies in this bad Mel Gibson depiction of the passion.  However, please allow me to point out one more. <br />  <br />Several years ago, I went to a Jesuit university in the Midwest.  There, I was befriended by one of the Jesuit Theology instructors.  And he was a good one!  With several published books and papers under his belt, he still speaks at conferences on the subject of Jesus' ultimate sacrifice - his death.  In 1985 to 1986, I helped this brilliant man read through and organize literally hundreds of documents on the subject of crucifixion.  A few years later, the fruit of both of our labors was published in several periodicals and textbooks.   <br /> <br />In this impressive work, my friend and teacher wrote that \\"...there has never been any definitive link between flogging and crucifixion\\".  Crucifixion was met to be demoralizing and painful, but above all, SLOW.  The Romans generally avoided anything that would speed the death process along.  The fact that close to half of Gibson's movie depicts Romans ripping pieces of Jesus' skin away compliments of a few devices of torture just does not make sense.  True, Pilot could have intended flogging to be Jesus' ONLY punishment, but that is not highly likely.  What Gibson refuses to believe (or at least depict in this film), is that the Jews were not the only group who wanted Jesus to die.  Pilot and the Romans were just as guilty of that.  For Pilot to have his men beat Jesus half to death then free him to rebel rouse again was just not how the Romans operated!  In those days, if you were a fomenter of any kind of disturbance in Roman controlled lands, you were put to death.  Period.   <br /> <br />Also, affixing the victim to the cross by nailing was not all that common.  Spikes through the wrists and feet could result in a quick death due to blood loss, and quick death was not the objective of a crucifixion.  Often crucifixion victims hung on the cross for days, and this was just fine with the Romans.  Though most eventually died of suffocation, some died of starvation or heart attack resulting from shock.   <br /> <br />Gibson ignores these facts seemingly to guilt trip the viewer into believing what he believes.  Sorry Mel, not this viewer! <br />
B000ICM5VW|1.0|BORING. LONG. It stars Jack Black, which automatically makes it bad. But the drawn-out story just makes it worse. <br /> <br />On the positive side, it looks good. HD-DVD is a winner. And the fairly reasonably priced XBox 360 HD-DVD adapter is well worth every penny.

B000002JR8|3.0|After having reached a huge amount of success with thier 2nd album, \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" Pantera returned to give us \\"Far beyond Driven\\" Now, I am not saying that the band \\"sold out\\" but the album certainly looks like it written to appeal to an even larger fan base. The opening track \\"Strength beyond Strength\\" starts off furiously, and then the album starts to crumble from the opening of the second track \\"Becoming\\". \\"5 Minutes Alone\\", \\"I'm Broken\\", and \\"Good Friends, and a bottle of Pills\\" are what drags the album down. Simple song struture, lack of intelligent lyrics, and more a \\"poppy\\" metal feel, are not very Pantera like, and thats a helluva lot of filler to start out an album with. The album shifts gears with \\"Hard Lines, Sunken Cheeks\\" which is the best song on the album. \\"Slaughterd is my second favorite track, in which Phil almost have a \\"Death Metal\\" vocal style on it. Believe me, he can pull it off too, as I have seen concert footage of him doing a Song wiht Morbid Angel, and he pulls it with ease. \\"25 Years\\" is a pretty strong song, and \\"Shedding Skin\\" and \\"Using my Third Arm\\" are passible, but nothing special. \\"Theories of Rejection\\" and the cover of Sabbtahs \\"Planet Caravan\\" end the album on a high note. So lets see, 12 songs, Six of them really shine, Two of them are so-so, and the rest are just plain flat out suck. That might cut it on any other record, but for a Pantera album, in which all their other albums seem to have almost no filler, its just not worth of anything higher then Three Stars.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|Great album, although like others have said it took a few listens to fully appreciate it. Was fortunate enough to see them play the entire album at their show on Halloween and the new songs really hold their own  besides the all time favorites. Don't miss the chance to pick up a copy and to see the guys live if you get the chance.
078322947X|5.0|I really like this movie.. all the actors were great and the music .. ah the music !!!! The Tangerine Dream music is unique .. great ... a wonderfull movie .. for all the family. Highly recommended
B000I0QL82|5.0|This is a wonderful 1940s musical. While the plot is thin, the music by Irving Berlin is fantastic. Fred Astair's dancing in the firecracker number is incredible. I first saw this about five years ago and it is now a holiday tradition. This special edition DVD is the clearest version I have seen.
B00005JO20|3.0|I cannot believe a movie that was over 3 hours long got so little accomplished.  Ther look of the film starts out very good but when they get to the island it is like watching a cartoon.  All that I heard about this movie was how awesome the fights are but they dragged on as badly as the rest of the movie does.  Jack Black is not bad playing an actual actor though he does not have a lot of range.  The thing that really set me off was that he has the final words of the movie and wtf, he ends up being the smart one?<br /><br />I hate to repeat something I have I have read on here about a hundred times but I must say it again, do not expect anything close to Lord of the Rings.  Overall there are some touching moments with Kong but I would really recommend this movie to children.
B00005JPB4|5.0|Without the benefit of having seen this film, it would be very easy to condemn it is a blood and guts war movie.  This would be grossly unfair.  Sure there is extended action involving some grisly scenes, but the film has much more to offer.  This film is not gory so much as touching and poignant.  It is a must see film.<br /><br />As Clint Eastwood has evolved into a director later in his career, he has shown his remarkable depth of talent.  He is no longer the spaghetti western star.  Rather, he is now a brilliant and thought provoking creator of great films.  \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" certainly falls into this category.<br /><br />It would have been simple to create a simple war film where good fights evil and, in the end, the good guys win.  This is probably the typical Hollywood script.  Eastwood has not opted for such a ho hum approach.  Instead, he has crafted a film that asks many questions and invites the viewer to reach his or her own conclusions.  The film is full of ambiguities.<br /><br />The essence of the story is simple.  The US invasion of Iwo Jima is the backdrop to the story of the famous photograph of a group of marines raising a flag on the top of Mount Suribachi.  It is a totemic photograph that has been reproduced countless times and seen by most western people.  The act was incidental to a great and significant battle in World War II.  However, the subsequent story of those surviving men who raised the flag is a much less well known than the photograph itself.  Eastwood tells the story and tells it brilliantly.<br /><br />Make an effort.  Go see this film!

If you have any interest what-so-everin the Chili Peppers, or Anthony Keidis, buy this book, but be prepared for one hell of a story
0375703764|4.0|I was led to this book through the author's sister, Poe.  Being someone who knows the difference between semantics and semiotics, I figured this looked like an interesting book to pick up.  I'm glad that I did.  It is a great mix of pop culture, intelligence, sex, angst, and a great story in a world so detailed that it must be real.  At times, it is a play within a play within a play and sometimes you're not quite sure how many layers there are.  The layout of the book itself is also amazing.<br /><br />I am only giving it 4 stars because it does drag a bit at parts, but that is a bit of the charm of it.  I could also be influenced by the fact that my reading of it was a bit broken up into chunks so I was anxious for important things to happen anytime I picked it up.
B0001XALTG|5.0|Plenty of reviews have described this amazing movie. I'd just like to add a note on the meaning of the title.  Most people have ignored it - one reviewer thought it was a reference to the frequency of shooting up. As an (ex) Brit, who grew up in Scotland, when I saw it, some time ago, I just automatically assumed something quite different.    *** BUT - see the reader's comment below! An informative correction to the ideas that follow! ***  First - trainspotting is an actual hobby in Britain. Remember that this is a small country with a dense and active rail network. Lots of people are really, really interested in trains, but trainspotting is kind of the very lowest-grade interest.  Trainspotters stand around stations, or major rail junctions, or marshalling yards, and just collect train facts - usually engine numbers, sometimes appearances of some particular kind of rolling stock. That is all they do - make lists!  (Or sometimes trade number lists with other spotters, or exult in the size of their list).  So the image of a trainspotter is a low-energy person, very conventional in outlook, probably standing for hours in the rain in a shabby raincoat...one who has pretty much given up on ever doing anything exciting and who absolutely needs to get a life!  Collecting train numbers is basically pure, time-consuming obsession. Collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks, or any of the thousand other odd things people collect, sometimes has another dimension - artistic interest, investment, etc - train numbers lead nowhere.     So to me the title \\"Trainspotting\\" was a sardonic reminder of the monotonous, meaningless \\"normal\\" life that the guys were rebelling against and trying to escape from - unwisely, but desperately - in their drug usage. It was the background against which the vivid and certainly scary picture was painted.     Hope this was helpful. Would be interesting to hear from anyone associated with the movie if that's right - as I say, it was just the natural., automatic interpretation for me.     PS - after reading many, many reviews - why is it that so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell the words definite and definitely? Many keep thinking there's an A in there somewhere...one even wrote \\"defiantly\\" which gave an interesting and unintended twist, and of course passed spell-check...Oh well.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|\\"The Medium\\" instantly became my favorite show on television in 2005.  I usually am fascinated by shows with elements of the paranormal, which tuned me in.  However, it is the realism of the family relationship that is most fascinating.  Patricia Arquette who was in \\"Ed Wood\\" with Johnny Depp plays Alison DuBois.  Her Emmy win for Best Actress in a drama attests to her standing within the industry, but the on-screen chemistry with Jake Weber who was in \\"Meet Joe Black\\" and plays her husband Joe is riveting.  They fight, spat, try to mask conflict in front of their kids, juggle an impossible number of real-life tasks, and have layers of humor and romance that make this seem like a real family that loves each other and deals with the unusual circumstances of Alison's psychic ability.  I found after watching the initial show that when the reruns would show, I still wanted to watch them over episodes of CSI Miami that I had not seen.  When I bought the DVD, I was hoping there might have been an episode I'd missed, but I'd seen them all between NBC & Lifetime reruns several times.  I'm impressed by how entrancing each episode is and the quality of the writing.  Alison's dreams are like clues that she struggles to fit together.  What impresses me about Alison is that she sincerely struggles to do the right thing.  In a world of violence, it's often hard to be clear which way the moral compass points.  In the episode \\"In Sickness & Adultery\\" her tip places her on the witness stand with an unethical hostile prosecutor that seeks to embarrass her.  As she comes back that he cheated to pass his law exams and is cheating on his wife, she finds that her best defense is the truth.  The two older daughters are also jewels.  Maria Lark as Bridget often has my entire family in stitches with her offbeat humor like shouting at her mom who wakes screaming from a bad dream, \\"Mom, please stop doing that!\\"  Sofia Vassilieva as the older Aerial keeps the arguments at the breakfast table bouncing.  David Cubitt who plays the reoccurring role of Detective Lee Scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry with Arquette.  Miguel Sandoval as the district attorney Manuel Duvalos has such a focused calmness that he centers the crime portion of the show.  (Perhaps we will sometime see more about his family.)  While it's hard to pick my favorite first season episode, the complex plot of \\"A Priest, A Doctor & Medium Walk into an Execution Chamber\\" is a jewel, with the police chasing a ghost who apparently has just committed murder.  The DVD commentaries and introduction to the real-life Alison DuBois really give excellent background for fans of the show.  This is one show that reaches the level of art for me.  Its excellence will make it memorable for a long time & this DVD collection a valuable addition to an entertainment collection.  Bravo!bouncing.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This presentation of Pride and Prejudice is lovely yet realistic.  I love the attention to details, like the dishes on the table (shown as would appear naturally, not perfectly set), the lighting in the ballroom (candlelight), the gowns (not perfectly pressed).  Keira Knightly is a wonderful Elizabeth - witty, observant, happy and beautiful.  The countryside is unspoilt.  The story is represented much as the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version, but with tweaks in the screenplay.  I found the difference in words refreshing and it is a fresh view of an old favorite.  I recommend this version heartily.  I love all versions of Pride and Prejudice but this is really, really nice.

Decent amount of Grand Guignol for us gore-hounds of the world (please don't write to tell me which flicks are more gross as I already know and own most of them). <br />I did not give this movie five stars for a small variety of reasons; the screenplay could have been tweaked a bit,  and certain characters are not really developed to fullest effect.  But I really enjoyed this movie:  I don't want to get picky. <br />I do not view this as a \\"horror\\" movie in the classic sense,  but SAW should make you uncomfortable in the extreme.  Avoid the psychedelics for this one,  you crazy kids. <br />As a mystery,  it's great.  A good mystery must very carefully hide the true answers,  all the while dropping sufficient clues to allow the viewer to slove the puzzle.  Saw succeeds perfectly and the misdirection is inspiring.  I felt as if I had been led around like a mouse in a maze of nightmares.  Usually I figure these things out but this one fooled me more than twice. <br />So,  see this film and enjoy.  Try not to read any spoilers;  SAW is best seen with as little info in advance as possible.  If you want to see something really funny,  watch it with someone squeamish. <br />I know people who walked out of the theater and won't get the video.  That's amusing to me because SAW made me H U N G R Y !!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000028PI|4.0|Definetly one the Alice's best along with many of his other great ones. It is worth purchasing especially for \\"Lost in America\\".
B0007MWZEK|1.0|It's a total waste of money.  First the stick broke (within first weeks of purchase), then the battery weakened (about 5 mins of charge after only 6 months of purchase). Sad thing is I would have paid more money for this product if it worked as it should have.
B000002KN8|3.0|Sometimes it is interesting to hear where a band began. And for some people, they will need to approach \\"Speak & Spell\\" with an open mind. For one thing, don't expect the hard-rock/gospel approach of \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" and don't expect any of the goth from \\"Black Celebration\\" forward. It's nothing like that. Alan Wilder hadn't yet joined by this point and Martin Gore only writes two of the 11 songs here. Also, though, there's a good chance that if you love Yazoo and Erasure but care little for later DM, you would enjoy this album. It is not dark at all: It's very happy, and some of it is so in a goofy way.    This album's strengths also tend to be the weaknesses. This album practically defines early-'80's synth-pop. All of these are certainly pop songs. There are certainly novelty moments in here: Most notably, the cheesy \\"What's Your Name?\\" which actually spells out \\"p-r-e-double t-y\\", and which has the chorus of \\"you're such a pretty boy.\\" \\"Boys Say Go\\" and \\"Nodisco\\" are quite as explicitly in that category, but will sound goofy to some. Gore's songwriting got better in later DM albums, and the songs he contributes here are kind of average. \\"Big Muff\\" is a techno instrumental that kind of goes on for longer than it needs to, although a nice shot of early techno. Oh, and if you don't like repetitive you won't find much in this album either. It is pretty repetitive. The lyrics are not deep. Usually the hooks and structures save it from being disposable, although a few tracks here are pretty forgettable, like \\"Puppets\\", which seems more like a B-side to me, the only real dud on here. It is not that bad however, and there are highpoints, particularly in \\"Just Can't Get Enough.\\" I like the original version more, but the schizo mix works fine enough for me. This is the most famous here for a good reason: It's catchy, it's got the classic pop song-writing, and it's got a sing-along refrain, complete with those cool old-school synths. I like listening to this because the band sounds so young and naïve. Gahan hadn't yet gotten his dark, rich voice which came on later albums, but in some ways that makes this a more melodic release. It could also be that he wasn't even 20 yet by the time of the album's release. A few moments, unfortunately, don't do much for me at all.    If you're a casual fan, I recommend \\"The Singles 81>85\\" and the import version, which is better than the U.S. version. They keep \\"Dreaming of Me\\" and \\"JCGE (Schizo mix),\\" but those are at the end and it uses the whole original \\"S&S\\" release that had \\"I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead\\" (great example of the New Romantic style they had early on; not that depressing), another version of \\"Any Second Now,\\" as well as tracks non-existant here. It isn't one of my favorite DM albums, but the ceiling is pretty high for them if you ask me. It is most certainly the song-writing of Vince Clarke, for better or worse.
B000GYI32M|4.0|The OC was a huge letdown. The ending of season three will make you wonder why you spent all those hours watching and putting in the effort with the characters. It quite possibily was one of the dumbest moves I have seen. While \\"The OC\\" is looking very promising in the few episodes I've seen of Season 4, it makes you ask yourself...\\"Why the hell did they go in that direction\\"? I do like  what I've seen so far of Season 4, but I just feel so cheated right now with how  they let all the fans down
B000FS9FCG|3.0|It's nice but I'll be getting the HD DVD version when my HD DVD player arrives.
0393327655|5.0|Sam Harris presents a compelling, rational look at many of the reasons that religion is not just a neutral entity for those who choose to participate in it but actually an alarming and dangerous threat to all people, whether religious or not,  as individuals and as a collective whole. This book is very well thought out, logical, and well articulated. The only drawback, I would say, is that at times in the book there are a number of philosophical theories and jargon that can be a bit to keep up with, but it's only for a few pages and definitely worth the effort...otherwise not a hard read. By highlighting the themes of love, compassion, reason, and honesty, Harris's book is also uplifting and hopeful. The book seems thoroughly researched and there are extensive endnotes for those interested (as I was!). I must say, I find it astonishing that some reviewers have said that this book actually strengthened their faith...how can Harris saying that there is no evidence for someone to have a blind, irrational faith strengthen anyone's blind, irrational faith? Maybe because it's blind and irrational--perhaps they need to re-read the book with a mind more open to the facts. Harris sums it up best when he says, on pg. 225, \\"The litmus test for reasonableness should be obvious: anyone who wants to know how the world is, wheher in phyical or spiritual terms, will be open to new evidence.\\" I hope this intelligent and tender book has an exponentially far reaching impact on this generation and those to come.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I remember reading the novel jarhead after I left the Corps, and seeing a lot of similarities between my experience and Swoff's, even though they were more than ten years apart.  I saw an ad for this movie, and knew that I would have to see it.  I bought it as soon as it came on DVD, and loved it.  However, I remember reading reviews in the Military Times newspaper; some Marines said it reflected life in the Corps realistically, some said it didn't.  Here's the funny part of that: the Marines who said it was realistic, were all grunts, like me.  The ones who said otherwise, weren't.  So, for those of you who have loved ones serving in the Marine Corps, I would recommend this movie and the book its based upon for a gift for your Marine.  Jamie Foxx, while he wasn't the best example of a Marine Staff Sergeant, wasn't terrible either.  And Jake G., played a great role as a man who entered the service with one idea of it was going to be, and leaving with an altogether different opinion, brilliantly.  If you want to know what an infantry Marine goes through, read the book, watch the movie.  You won't hate the Corps, but you will question its personnel. <br />
1560100842|5.0|Since I'm an animation student, I kept thinking to myself, I needed to buy an animation book and I bought this one simply because of the price. This book is a great book for drawing because it teaches one to draw the basic shape of the character first and then add more details and then define the contours last. Whereas most art books especially begining ones will teach one to do a pure contour line drawing. <br /> <br />In addition to learning to draw the characters, this book has animation cycles, timing, and other gesture, and other basics of animation. A book that is so invaluable that this statement is an understatement.
0425152251|5.0|I found this to be a great overview of the history of philosophy.  Although the storyline probably did help maintain my interest, this is not a great novel by any means.  As a book on philosphy, it is probably not for someone who is already well versed in the subject.  But for your average college level reader, and probably for an above average teen, this is a great introduction to philosphy.
B000F5GNX8|1.0|Weak forced dialogue, silly overly thought plot, unsympathetic characters, and unfunny and you have Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. I saw a clip of Robert Downey accidentally audition for a part from this movie and thought it was going to be a funny movie about a mix up, where a crook gets to be come an actor solving a murder mystery.  <br /> <br />Instead, I got a bunch of unwatchable nonsense with a unbelievable plot, uninteresting characters, forced unnatural over the top dialogue, an annoying Robert Downey, and a supposed love story subplot with zero chemistry. The movie is hard to follow which is why they have narration in the beginning, since this doesn't even resemble any film noir flick I have ever seen. <br /> <br />At the end I found myself feeling like I wasted 1 ½ hours for characters I didn't care about and a plot I wasn't interested in, and the worst part is I didn't even laugh one single time. Robert Downey sums it up in narration at the end, \\"it's a dumb movie.\\" He is right, and I don't understand anyone who thought this was actually a good movie. <br />
B000002V1D|2.0|While the previous album, Liberty, had some weak tracks, it had a few things going for it. First, it was a real concise album. The songs fit well together. Next, the members created the feeling of a Duran Duran album. I would almost term it the anti-Rio, with dark, soulful, and sensual undertones. Gone was the 1980s feel of earlier works, yet the album presented chemistry with danceable tracks and a solid commitment to creating an overall frantic listening experience (either positive or negative). With the exception of My Antarctica and Serious as great tracks, they ultimately failed to win many new fans. But eventually, most artists fail at some point. Yet they could still call Liberty a Duran Duran album because they stood for something and tried their heart out. In short, they were authentic in their failure.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, with the Wedding Album, they did the total opposite. With the commercial disappointment of Liberty and losing Sterling Campbell as drummer, the four members set out to create a new sound for the 1990s. While there is nothing wrong with inventing a new sound and image, the Wedding Album became a mere vehicle to capture fan nostalgia and make some quick sales with two great singles, Ordinary World, and Come Undone. Anyone who bought the album, however, found an incoherent mess of songs copying styles from other artists. Here was a band that stood for something in its heyday, now cheaply attempting to blend in with other popular artists of the time to sell some singles. While it worked for that album, notice that they could not sustain that momentum for over ten years until the band returned to its true form with Astronaut. Nick Rhodes recently commented that while the 80's were about artists expressing themselves, the 90's were about blending in. Unfortunately, that is exactly what Duran Duran did, denying their own creativity and greatness at the core. The results were mediocre and hollow. By standing for nothing, the members created an \\"Ordinary World\\" in the album's undertones. Regardless of markets, times, pressures, and sales, would you ever define Duran Duran as ordinary? Not me!  <br /> <br />LeBon was also having substantial vocal problems during this time. As a result, many of the vocals sounded thin, strained, and turned down. None of the Above, as well as a few other tracks, overuses a processor. It is as if a machine sung the songs, not Simon the Great. This may have been a time when the rock star lifestyle and smoking was wearing thin on him. But to the listener, it sounds like he wasn't really trying. After all, if mediocrity is the goal in the 90s, then who cares how it sounds? <br /> <br />To end on a positive note, the band are writing and sounding better than ever today. Simon now looks half his age on the Wedding Album and sings better than ever. Even with the recent loss of Andy Taylor, the band are touring and recording, remaining true to the music, and handling market pressures with a seasoned grace and style. They are also gaining the critical recognition they have deserved for so long. I will close by stating that if the Wedding Album is the only thing that kept this band together continuously throughout the years, then I will gladly alter my rating to five stars in a heartbeat. But don't do it again! <br />
B000I5X81K|3.0|I eagerly awaited his new CD and bought it because I love Josh.  I listened to it one time and had no desire to listen to it again.  :(  The classical feel is gone from this album and it seemed like Josh wasn't quite sure where he wanted to go with this CD.<br /><br />There are couple of songs I adore but the entire album doesn't seem to \\"flow\\".  Still - it is Josh singing.  Can't go wrong there.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Mr. Groban stepped out of his \\"safe zone\\", but even though different still very enjoyable.  Lullaby and Weeping are both excellent -- especially the harmony with Ladysmith Black Mambazo.  Mai (italian) and Solo Por Ti (spanish) and Un Giorno Per Noi (italian Romeo & Juliet) showcase what Josh is best know for.  So She Dances has a beautiful melody and lyrics to match.  Now or Never (Imogen Heap) and Machine (Herbie Hancock) are the biggest steps away from the tried and true Josh, but the change is worth listening to.  After several listens to Awake, I'm sold on the change in direction and look forward to a combination of old and new in future releases. <br /> <br />I would love to see Mr. Groban record more broadway songs -- Check out his version of \\"Not While I'm Around\\" from \\"Barbara Cook at the MET with Special Guests\\" CD.  In addition, a future Holiday CD with the likes of his version of \\"O Holy Night\\" and \\"Believe\\" would be a must buy.
B000GIWS7E|4.0|This is a decent offering from the boys, but the 1st setlist is pretty horrid.  None of those songs really show off the band's potential and some are just plain boring.  Getting into the 2nd setlist we see the progressive monster that Dream Theater have become.  The dvd is put together well enough and there are no audio glitches to speak of.  The documentary and bonus songs are pretty cool, but I would have enjoyed some commentary from these guys like their first 2 dvds.  All in all an enjoyable experience, but topping Budokan will be nearly impossible at this point.
0880794968|5.0|This deck is the traditional Rider Waite Smith with colour added. That makes for an interesting twist on a traditional deck. I personally do not like all the yellows on the real RWS deck, so this deck is really appealing to me. It has nicer and softer colours, but the images are not changed to toyed with in any way. You get the tradition without the drab colour scheme. I really liked this deck and get a lot of use from it.
B000E8QVWY|3.0|This is another one of those big films that I was supposed to love.  After all, I really do love country music.  And Johnny Cash is one of my favorites.  But Joaquin Phoenix doesn't look like him and that bothered me during the whole film.  And Reese Witherspoon, cast has his lady-love June Carter did a good acting job, but I never really could relate to her.  Yes, there is chemistry between these two actors.  But this film needed more than that to really hold my interest.<br /><br />One of the problems with the story is that its all been done before.  A musician with a humble background who made good in the music industry, has a deep relationship with someone other than his wife, and who turns to alcohol or drugs because he can't escape blaming himself because of the death of a sibling.  The film \\"Ray\\" was all about that and was a better film.  \\"Walk the Line\\" seemed like a weak remake.<br /><br />I liked the music of course.  That was good.  But the story was slow and predictable.  The film did have its good parts but I just couldn't get into it and can therefore only give it a lukewarm recommendation.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This movie did an excellent job of showing environmentalism in a context that kids can understand. <br />It was a bit violent and its depictions of war was harsh, but I still think  <br />it would be suitable for most children. <br /> <br />The \\"Americanized\\" version, \\"Warriors of the Wind\\", has less of the political <br />statement but also lacks the spirit.

B000IU3XU6|1.0|Reviewer: Tievoli \\"Music Wiz\\" (Los Angeles, CA) - See all my reviews   I am giving Josh Groban 5 stars for his voice and 0 stars for his selection of music.   Maybe it's not his fault, maybe it's the producer's.     We all know that some other artists with a bad voice are trying to sing songs who were sang by great singers. They were just simply killing it. In this case is just the opposite, these horrible songs are killing Josh Groban's voice. The reason why the CD is #1 seller on Amazon, because he has done so well with the previous albums, that people don't read the reviews or listen to the previews.     I am waiting for #4 release... I am really curious...

B000I5X81K|5.0|Those expecting the \\"Josh Groban sound\\" of years past may have to look a little deeper to find it on this album, but it's still there...it's just been expanded into an evolutionary, eclectic feast of sounds that show Groban is not one content to simply rest on his laurels. For his third release, Groban forsakes the safe formula that made him a superstar for a much more courageous, experimental blend--an unlikely classical/funky/romantic/groovy/world music fusion that works remarkably well despite the odds. <br /> <br />Groban still rewards his audience with the sensitive romantic ballads they've come to expect, such as the Italian \\"L'Ultima Notte\\" or Spanish \\"Un Dia Llegara\\"--showing he still knows how to use that knee-buckling baritone to full effect.  It's pure classic Groban, and nobody does it better. <br /> <br />The true triumph of this album, however, comes from the honesty of self-penned, sensitive works like \\"February Song,\\" where Groban ruminates on the complexities of life and its unanswered questions, and in the improbable collaboration with such wide-ranging artists as Dave Matthews, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Imogen Heap, and Herbie Hancock.  Groban goes out on a limb with this effort, exposing his social conscience on songs as \\"Weeping\\" and showing on the funky \\"Machine\\" that he's edgier than most thought he could be.  The result is unexpected magic...  This willingness to constantly buck the mainstream pop mold and refusal to \\"stay inside the box\\" demonstrates a level of bravery and artistry that would stand well as an example to others in this industry ruled by \\"more of the same\\" and \\"whatever works.\\" <br /> <br />Full appreciation of this album requires a bit of thought and a willingness to move beyond the \\"Gira Con Me\\" Josh Groban, but those able to make the leap are delightfully rewarded. I for one am already intrigued to see where he'll take his listeners next...
B000GFLE86|1.0|Terrible, awful, without exception the dullest album I have heard in a long time.  I hadn't heard of this woman, but was recommended to listen to her because I like Diana Krall.  Personally I fail to see any connection between the two.  This is appalling stuff, not a single song raises itself out of the mire of dire musicianship and lack-lustre moaning.  Its one for the bin.

B00000D9TQ|4.0|\\"Hits\\" is a collection of 16 songs from Phil Collins solo career, from 1981-1998. I'm a big fan of Genesis (both Phil Collins' and Peter Gabriel's), and Phil's \\"Groovy Kind of Love\\" was playing on the way home on my first day of school, so I'll always have a soft spot for this collection, and though it's missing and has room for a couple of the hits I would have liked (like \\"Don't Lose My Number\\") I have gone through a couple of copies of this one.    Phil really has a warmth and honesty to his love songs that's pretty unique. His earthy voice, matched with the particular production he prefers, captures and evokes the 1980s pretty well too. That's not to say he's just 1980s ballads. He also sings of contemporary issues like in \\"Another Day In Paradise\\" and \\"Both Sides of the Story\\", and does interesting descriptions of character in songs like \\"In The Air Tonight\\" and \\"Take Me Home\\". There's a good mix of all that here. Phil's voice can get pretty powerful, on \\"I Wish It Could Rain Down\\" for intance. He'd come a long way from quietly singing \\"For Absent Friends\\" (one of his first recorded songs, featured on the 1971 Genesis album \\"Nursery Cryme\\").  He's a great drummer too, always had been, and even then he's not afraid to play around with a drum machine, which were seen to some as a bit threatening in the 1980s, from what I've read.    The bonus track on \\"Hits\\" is a version of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colours\\", with some backing vocals by Babyface. It's pretty laid back, fits in with the hits, and I'm glad to have it. The booklet folds out into a mini-poster with the vague impressions of his solo album covers (as painted on this CD art) on it. On the other side, there are credits for all the songs, which were interesting. I had no idea both Sting and Phil's old friend Peter Gabriel do backup vocals of \\"Take Me Home\\", and I wouldn't have known unless I read it here.    There's a 2 CD Phil Collins compilation out there called \\"Love Songs\\", and while there's some good tracks, and some interesting bonus and live stuff on it, it's all slower and sentimental, and doesn't really show off Phil's versatility as well as \\"Hits\\". Plus, with this compilation, there are songs from soundtracks and non-Phil Collins albums (like \\"Buster\\", \\"Chinese Wall\\", etc) that you won't have to go hunting round for, as they're all here in one place.    Genesis' \\"Turn it On Again: The Hits\\" would go well with this one, as it has Phil's other hits like \\"Invisble Touch\\", \\"I Can't Dance\\" and \\"Follow You, Follow Me\\". Recommended. Four and a half stars.
B000089RVX|5.0|I originally bought this CD way back in 2003 after hearing Bring Me To Life whilst watching Daredevil. The tune haunted me all the way home and the next day I searched and searched until I found out who the band was. Upon discovering they were a fairly new band with a CD about to be released, I had to have it. Upon receiving the CD a month or so later I was thrilled that I'd taken the risk, as I often buy whole CDs on the strength of one song only to find that the rest of the album is rubbish. This is not the case here. After the first listen I knew I'd stumbled across something special. Amy Lee and Ben Moody had created something I'd never encountered before and I was hooked. Her voice, the lyrics and the haunting melodies are breathtaking. The CD has been on almost constant rotation ever since and three years later, it still doesn't get old. <br /> <br />It's not often you come across a CD that you truly love from the opening guitar riffs to the very final lingering note, without skipping a song or momentarily tuning it out. This is one of those rarities; one which I will still be listening to ten years from now, and I expect it will be with the same reverence and enthusiasm.
B00005JPC4|4.0|I have to admit this 2006 movie based on the book by Peter Mayle (whose \\"A Year in Provence\\" is a favorite of mine) starts rather unpromisingly since it carries the same smug, self-satisfied attitude that its hero has. Director Ridley Scott takes a while to find the right rhythm for this romantic comedy, but he eventually does, even if it means recycling elements from other similarly executed fish-out-of-water films like \\"Baby Boom\\", \\"Lost in Translation\\" and \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\". In fact, the whole venture feels decidedly old-fashioned with formula elements feeling like they come from some Universal film made in the 1960's, but the retro-chic aspect somehow works like a fictionalized account of a lifestyle cable channel program since there is little in the way of real dramatic conflict.<br /><br />Atypically cast in a lighter vein here, the naturally pugnacious Russell Crowe seems to be channeling one of the Grants (Cary or Hugh, take your pick) in portraying a Machiavellian-level London investment banker named Max Skinner, who unexpectedly inherits a dilapidated chateau and vineyard in Provence from his uncle Henry, a figure he loved as a child but has since become estranged due to Max's selfish, greed-obsessed existence. Written by Marc Klein, the bulk of the movie is about what Max does with the estate as he argues with the longtime vintner and becomes entwined with two women - pretty Christie, who claims to be Henry's illegitimate daughter from a tryst with an American, and the too-perfectly-named Fanny Chanel, a beautiful local restaurateur who tries mightily to resist Max's romantic overtures after a most bumpy start. As Max weighs his options, his unforgiving career and jet-setting lifestyle back in London appear to be in jeopardy.<br /><br />More like a Cagney than a Grant, Crowe has the type of aggressive screen persona that takes on all comers, so he seems more in his element being a jerk. However, he acquits himself more than you would expect as the story begins to humanize his character, and he is more deft as a comic actor than even Scott presumes. For example, there are extended sequences in an empty swimming pool and during a tennis match when Scott seems to mistake action for slapstick. Max may be Crowe's most likeable role since the loving gay son he played in the 1994 Australian indie, \\"The Sum of Us\\". In flashbacks, Freddie Highmore, Johnny Depp's prot&eacute;g&eacute; in \\"Finding Neverland\\" and \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", affectingly plays Max as a child, even though the lack of physical resemblance is a bit jarring. Better is Albert Finney as rhapsodizing Uncle Henry since his casting harkens back to the actor's youth in south-of-France-set movies like \\"Two for the Road\\" and \\"The Picasso Summer\\" in the late sixties.<br /><br />Australian actress Abbie Cornish convincingly portrays a guileless American with more than a passing interest in wine, while Marion Cotillard is a stunning, feisty presence as Fanny (although the obvious age disparity between her and Crowe makes some of the back story a bit of a head scratch). Entertaining though more standard rom-com contributions are made by Tom Hollander as Max's realtor best friend Charlie (in an update of the usual Gig Young third-wheel role), Didier Bourdon and Isabelle Candelier as caretaker Duflot and his playful wife, and Archie Panjabi as Max's jaded but devoted assistant Gemma. The wine-growing region of Provence hardly needs more exposure in movies, but Philippe Le Sourd's cinematography brings it glowingly to life. A most idiosyncratic soundtrack accompanies the film with genre-irrelevant chestnuts like Patti Page's \\"Old Cape Cod\\", Harry Nilsson's \\"Gotta Get Up\\" and a French cover version of \\"Yellow Polka-Dot Bikini\\" by Richard Anthony. This is the kind of movie where you can see the ending a mile away, but I have to say for the most part, I enjoyed the ride.he story begins to humanize his character, and he is more deft as a comic actor than even Scott presumes.

This is the kind of movie where you can see the ending a mile away, but I have to say for the most part, I enjoyed the ride.

0399226907|4.0|I mainly bought this book because I remember reading it as a child and I was happy that I could now read this book with my son.  Now that I am reading to him as an adult I realise how educational it really is. Teaching not only days of the week but colours and even some numbers.
B00000IMTH|5.0|the first album by Rainbow \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\" was a good album with a few stellar tracks. their 2nd album \\"Rising\\" had a very progressive feel but i really didn't care much for the album as a whole. i expected to feel the same way about this album but i've gotta say, this is better than the previous 2 albums combined!<br /><br />Long Live Rock 'N' Roll is a straight up anthem that should endure the ages. Lady of the Lake is a good Zeppelin-esque track that'll keep your toes tappin', and L.A. Connection has a very hooky riff that just keeps this great experience going. Gates of Babylon is a very cool track and my 2nd favorite on the album. it uses keyboards, but still is able to keep the heaviness of a straight-up rocker, and with it's catchy middle eastern riff and chorus, what's not to love? Kill the King is amazing and in my opinion the hardest rocking track on the album. The Shed (Subtle) is a little forgettable to me and Sensitive to Light is a pretty good song but nothing amazing. what IS amazing is the last track Rainbow Eyes. this happens to be my favorite song here and for good reason. Dio's voice is beautiful, Blackmore's playing is mezmerizing, and the backup instruments (violins, flutes, etc.) are used perfectly to give this song a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" feel. very good stuff from very talented musicians. i recommend this album to fans of Dio, Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore, classic rock, or just music in general. in short....BUY IT!
B000002KIE|5.0|This is a must have album.  The only true Pistols album, and probably the first and last honest \\"Punk\\" rock album.  John Lydon is the perfect voice of his generation, and many generations to follow, who felt violated by the mainstream.  Steve Jones guitar playing obviously paved the way for for a lot of similar sounding bands (Holidays in the Sun opening track builds like many eighties bands, Motley Crue, etc...)  Glen Matlock is an uncommonly good bass player (Sid Vicious did not play on this album, and is not a a real Pistol kids) Paul Cook has a great rythmic sense, excellent if you like a ballsy AC/DC stomp with a lot more intensity.  One of the most amazing things about this album is their modesty in taking any credit for their over the top shameless innovation in creating a pseudo-macho, overbearing, angry pop rock.   <br /> <br />I listened to Greenday and The Ramones and enjoyed them to an extent, but they pale tragically in comparison to this one classic album.  Any one who claims that the Ramones, New York Dolls, etc.. were punk first misses the point in a big way.  These were glam rock bands, mildly anti-establishment in a tongue in cheek, often misguided way.  The Sex Pistols reek of revolution in their singular way.  Forcing it down your throat in anthem after anthem and believing in peoples abilities to understand the larger concepts explored in their songs, rather than pander to the cool of the drug culture and \\"blitzkrieg boppers\\" of their contemporaries. <br /> <br />If you don't like it you don't understand what punk could have accomplished and probably never will.  You're \\"Punk Rock\\" collection is a pompous, douchey, Rock and Roll Swindle without this album. <br />

0060934719|3.0|I've never been a particular fan of this sort of 'fantasy' novel, but I enjoyed 'Stardust'. I'm also largely unfamiliar with Gaiman's prose work(and I only vaguely know of his reputation in comics).<br /><br />It was obvious thatGaiman seemed to enjoy writting this story, and he used a very lighthearted, easy to follow approach, which should appeal even to those who might not usually be interested in 'fairy tales'.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed to learn there's a separate 'illustrated' edition, since I only read the paperback!(I am familiar with Charles Vess' work, and I wondered why Gaiman went out of his way to mention Vess in his afterword!)<br /><br />If you're on a 'quest' to be entertained, then give 'Stardust' a try!
B000HT3Q3M|5.0|I have seen Al Jarreau 20 times in concert (and recently saw Al and George perform at the Hollywood Bowl) and am a long-time fan from WAY BACK. There are a few Al CDs that you just play forwards and backwards (and back when they were cassettes, you wore out the tape) because they're just PERFECT. \\"Breakin' Away\\", \\"Jarreau\\" and \\"Heaven and Earth\\" come to mind. Well, add \\"Givin' It Up\\" to that list. If you're an old-school Al fan and you're wondering whether to buy this CD, BUY IT. It will live up to all of your Al expectations. There's a \\"Look the Rainbow\\" feel to it, there's a \\"Breakin' Away\\" feel to it, there's a \\"Jarreau\\" feel to it. There's even a \\"Glow\\" feel to it (when you think about tunes like \\"Milwaukee\\" and \\"Have You Seen the Child?\\"). Grassroots Al. <br /> <br />It's got the production values of \\"Heaven and Earth\\" and \\"Tenderness\\". FABULOUS production, arrangements, gathering of talent. There is not one song on here that you will skip as you're listening to it driving to work or whatever. In fact, if you're throwing a party and want to instantly get people in a jazzy party mood, put on this CD because between everybody from Chris Botti to Jill Scott to a SOULFUL Paul McCartney, people will stop and say, \\"Wow, listen to Jill and George tearing up 'God Bless the Child.'\\" And \\"Is that Paul McCartney tearing up 'Bring It on Home to Me'?\\" [Yes, it is.] Meanwhile, Al and George are working their magic the entire time, and guests will say, \\"Listen to George right there.\\" And, \\"Al is jamming right now.\\" It's a conversation-stopper provided by the best thing that can stop a conversation at a party: fabulous music that people must comment on. Of course, that's where the conversation picks right back up, so you win either way. The blend is perfect: Just a touch of scatting, just a touch of voice-beat, with lots of fabulous jazzy vocals by both Al and George, tons of great music solos, and George playing a perfect guitar. <br /> <br />If you're a George Benson fan, you will be THRILLED with this CD because George provides a fabulous through-line to every piece. He's ever-present with every wonderful thing he ever did on a guitar. He fronts many of the pieces, and he's not in any way relegated to \\"background guitarist.\\" He IS the music in every piece, with few exceptions. As much as I love Al, this CD is MAGICAL because of the blend of George and Al. ONLY THESE TWO CAN PAIR UP TO MAKE THIS KIND OF CD. There IS NO OTHER TEAM who could have pulled this off. You need Al's voice and George's guitar. Period. In fact, I'm guessing much of the jazz music world is a tad jealous right now of how simply GENIUS this CD is, as in, \\"Dang. These two are GREAT together. Wow.\\" <br /> <br />Bottom line: This is a perfect blend of these two greats' talents. George takes care of the music, while Al provides the wide gamut of vocals he's an expert at (and that only he can provide). If you've been a long-time fan of either of these two, you won't be disappointed. It's not lopsided. And it's OLD-SCHOOL in every good way.  <br /> <br />My prediction: This CD will sweep the Grammys. If it doesn't, there is no justice. Like another reviewer on this page, I intend to buy this CD for about EIGHT people. It's just THAT perfect.

B000002IZM|5.0|Don't hesitate: this is one of Vangelis' masterpieces. Moody, dark and seductive (no surprise to anyone who has seen the film), the music here is also in the best tradition of Vangelis' studio albums. It is a long suite taking the mood of the movie as it's starting point but functioning very well as a work independently.<br /><br />The beautiful \\"Memories of Green\\" was actually featured on the now rare \\"See You Later\\" album In many ways it was the stand-out track there. Here it fits perfectly.<br /><br />Other reviewers have raised concerns about the use of dialogue from the ffilm. To me it works perfectly: Vangelis has often blended the spoken work with his music for evocative effect - this is in many ways the peak of those experiments.

B000IU3XTW|4.0|I am normally not a huge fan of live albums, but when I heard this was an acoustic CD, I figured I'd check it out. I know that FF have done a lot of acoustic touring lately, playing their own shows and opening for Dylan, and I have unfortunately not been able to see them acoustically. This album is great! FF have once again released a solid album that is an evolution of their sound. I've seen FF live 3x, and while they are great, I had my doubts about D. Grohl's voice b/c he tends to scream a lot instead of singing. This album showcases his good voice. The Nirvana B-side \\"Marigold\\" is a pleasant surprise. They took 1 of my fave FF songs (Next Year) and made it way better. \\"Another Round\\" includes a great harmonica part. I love the acoustic \\"Times Like These.\\" \\"Skin and Bones\\" is a great track as well. The album closes w/ \\"Best of You\\" & \\"Everlong.\\" Unfortunately, the acoustic versions of these 2 songs do not hold a candle to the original versions. Nevertheless, I'd highly recommend this CD if you're at all interested in it. FF have yet to release anything disappointing. I think they're one of the very best rock bands of the past decade.

B000FUF6QS|5.0|This is an outstanding movie - disturbing, but real and highly recommend for anyone interested in history, comparative mythology.<br /><br />The plot of the move is that a responsible, Christian British policeman comes into a very insular Island community to investigate a missing girl, he discovers that he has stumbled into a pagan/heathen cult that follow the ways of the ancient British people who built Stonehenge. It isn't good vs evil, just different religions. Christopher Lee is excellent as the highest lord of the Island who takes religion/culture very seriously.<br /><br />For those who say \\"God is dead\\" - the Christopher Lee character presents a very different view. God/the Gods never died, they just await devoted followers to bring them forth and there is respect for believing Christian, but for you Christians you are warned, you better have strength and courage and the courage of your conviction to confront the old Gods and the practitioners of the Old Gods reawakened.<br /><br />This is a very hip, cool, great movie - I highly recommend it.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Can you believe it that it's been 15 years since Pearl Jam burst onto the music scene with its debut album \\"Ten\\"? Since then the band has taken a lot of musical (and other) detours, and also has been taken longer and longer between albums, but after a 4 year wait, here its their 8th proper studio album.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Jam\\" (13 tracks, 50 min.) sounds to me like a return to the basics of the band's music roots, namely rocking pretty hard. The album's 5 opening tracks all rock from the get-go, the one harder than the other: \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"World Wide Suicide\\", Comatose\\", \\"Severed Hand\\" and \\"Marker In the Sand\\". After that anyone would need a breather, and the band obliges with the gentile \\"Parachutes\\" (not to be confused with the Coldplay song of the same name). It rounds off a near-perfect first half of the album. The second half in comparison falters a bit. Highlights there include \\"Big Wave\\", \\"Come Back\\" and the close \\"Inside Job\\".<br /><br />In all, this album is a fine album, no question (and certainly an improvement over their previous album \\"Riot Act\\", which stands as the band's most disappointing album to date). I find it interesting that this album is simply titled \\"Pearl Jam\\", as if the band felt it needed to reintroduce itself to its fans and the rock community. Fact is, a lot of us have signed up for the long ride, good or bad. And this album certainly is a nice addition to the Pearl Jam catalogue.
B000H7JCG4|1.0|We have purchased a lot of poor quality 90210 tapes.  Finally we thought we would have a dvd with our favorite show!  NOT - all the music has been changed.  As my daughter said they replaced the original music that in many ways was a big part of each episode and put in random \\"circus\\" type music. Much of the music is not even from the same era. I will be trying to send mine back and once again watch my very fuzzy epsiodes - because no matter how bad the quality at least it is the original 90210!

0439679958|3.0|Horowitz's opening book in his chiller-thriller series introduces readers to 14-year-old Matt Freeman, practically an orphan and callously abandoned by contemporary London society.  As an alternative to jail for an attempted burglary (as a reluctant accomplice to a stabbing) Matt quickly chooses the new LEAF option. This program places troubled teens in quiet, rural areas where they receive a second chance with stable foster parents to become honest and productive members of society.  Unfortunately Matt seems destined for an even worse fate; if he had realized the horrors he would face in Lesser Malling in distant Yorkshire, he would have instantly rejected the LEAF project. <br /> <br />    With its Harry Potteresque elements, this book will grip readers of all ages as Matt is sucked into a dark world of roiling evil.  Nor was it by chance that the ancient crone, Jane Deverill (just reduce her surname) made a special journey down to London to claim him--as her prized property.  Shocked by his treatment at the dilapidated farm and the weird attitude of the villagers in Lesser Malling, Matt soon decides to run away.  Alas for him--his attempts are foiled by his hostess' disgusting spies and flagrant use of outright witchcraft.  <br /> <br /> As the gothic novel gathers frightening momentum--the plot gushing with blood and primeval evil--Matt gradually discovers that every adult who tries to help him pays the ultimate price with his life.  Insatiably curious about the purpose of an abandoned nuclear reactor, OMEGA ONE, Matt learns to his grief what horrors are about to be unleashed at the site called Raven's Gate--which was physically destroyed during the superstitious Middle Ages. <br /> <br /> Despite being baptized with snake's blood and possessing untapped powers of his own, the boy cannot realistically outwit and defy an entire village dedicated to devil worship, hell bent to unleash true Armageddon upon the UK.  Fortunately for our young hero there exists another secret society, the Nexus, whose international members convene to protect the unsuspecting world from these dire threats to human existence.  They alone believe Matt's story and are equally determined to save the world--one hellish Gate at a time.  This is the first in THE GATEKEEPRS series, featuring five Children who Saved the World once.  Matt is the first, but he managed to catch a brief glimpse of his unknown peers, who recognized his innate abilities and destiny to help save mankind. Despite its  <br />teenage hero, this book is not necessarily for Young Adults. If the black arts catch your literary fancy, then be prepared to travel to distant Lima, Peru, to coninue the saga of the Five who saved the World! <br />  <br /> <br />
B00005JPC7|5.0|This is a movie about an author's choices, and how they effect her life and the lives of those around her.  The casting is perfect.  The tone of each acting performance is sublime.

He knows he is making decisions that will lead to his death a few hours later, and he chooses to spend his final hours trying to help her, an innocent boy, and another friend from work in the best ways he can think of.<br /><br />The movie asks questions like:  If you knew you had to die in order save another person's life, would you?

B00005JPAM|5.0|`The Queen' primarily looks behind the scenes of Buckingham Palace during the crisis of Princess Diana's death.  It is an illuminating and comprehensive affair that focuses mainly on the detachment of the Royal family in a time of national grieving.  Like many recent pieces of historical fiction, `The Queen,' wisely uses ample footage from real videotape.  Diana's death, Britain's mourning, and newscasts intersperse the drama.  This works well, and, while some of the screenplay is speculative, they nearly get all of it right.  Peter Morgan is a dead ringer as Prime Minister, Blair, and Helen Mirren is more than reminiscent of Elizabeth II.   Their rendering of Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is a bullseye.  My only complaint is that, although we see plenty of The Queen's underbelly, her hard-boiled shell is mostly glossed over.  Elizabeth II has shown her vulnerability, but she can be much more indomitable than the drama suggests.  Perhaps this is presented because they couldn't go too far with this drama.  They understandably do try to be fair to the current monarch, even though they present her as grieving more over a slain stag than over any endearment to her estranged daughter-in-law's death.  Her grief is at her own perceived tarnished crown.  The funeral for her is a private affair.  And, here, Blair, who was in tune with the people, properly perceived the Royal Family would miss out on an opportunity to heal the nation.  He really has the dilemma, for he must balance the forces of those who wish to keep the Royal Family dignified and those who call to have their monarchy eliminated.  He draws from the sentiment of the people and properly eulogizes Diana's death, but balances becoming a laison for an institution he prudently realizes will never be put to death anytime soon.     Besides \\"great performances\\" the big draw should be taking in the subplot.  The scenes of Princess Di's private interviews, key scenes in her life, and the aftermath of her death providethe most poignant moments.  This isn't her movie, however, and it should be judged by the terms it was created.  The Queen's perspective brings about its own merits.  For who will not be struck about the state of affairs of England by looking upon the turmoil of the UK's most revered institution when it seems to remain aloof and stoic under the calamity of a competing fallen icon.  Although they prudently only present the suspect aspects that brought Diana's death, the whole picture becomes a fascinating composite of tragedy and regal isolation.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|Back in my youth, my parents talked of this mythical creature they called Meat Loaf. Unlike the mystery meat that would show up on the dinner table every couple week, the other Meat Loaf was a singer who released an Bat Out of Hell before I was born and was a massive hit only for Meat to disappear into obscurity not to be heard again. But then out of nowhere the same dude somehow had a hit song and accompanying video, the puzzling titled I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) that somehow made it onto MTV at the height of alternative rock and gangsta rap as well as the top of the singles chart. But unlike the previous album, Loaf didn't fall back into obscurity and found successes as a character actor staring such cinematic gems as Fight Club and Spice World. <br /> <br />But much like its predecessor, Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose came out a decade later than the previous volume. But unlike the other two Bat Out of Hell records, number three is the first that doesn't have \\"Songs by Jim Steinman\\" on the cover as Meat Loaf's partner decided not to partake in the third go around which caused a major riff considering Steinman controls the trademark on \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" and took the Loaf to court to keep him using the name. Obviously an agreement was reached that let Meat use the title but he won't be able to use the phrase in the title so when his next album is released in 2020, it won't be named Bat Out of Hell IV. <br /> <br />So Meat Loaf brought in Desmond Child, best know for his work with Aerosmith, to produce and help write a big chuck of the album. The still has the grandeur feel as it mixes Broadway theatrics with hard rock, but without Steinman, most of the songs just don't have the same emotional connection that the previous songs had with him on board. Steinman does show up in the writing credits as the Loaf tackles some of his older work that he hasn't done before including two song that were featured in the MTV version of Wuthering Heights which surprised me because I never realized that Wuthering Heights was a musical. He also poached two songs from Steinman's Batman: The Musical project. I think it's lucky that the musical never came to fruition from the lackluster songs the Loaf sings here despite Steve Vai showing up on In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher Is King, a song that most have been the villains theme. <br /> <br />Then there is It's All Coming Back to Me Now, a song from a never released Steinman album that was made famous by Celine Dion. This time around Loaf turns it into a duet, a long staple in the Loaf catalog which plays to much effect by pitting Loaf against a female singer. On the song his counterpart is Marion Raven who you might remember as a member of the early 00's Norwegian pop act M2M (wait you don't, well me neither). Meat also shares song with longtime concert partner Patti Russo on What About Love? as well as Jennifer Hudson, who appently lost some karaoke contest on television, for the song The Future Ain't What it Used to Be. But none of the songs stand up to Meat's past greatness which makes you wonder how much better this project could have been had Steinman been fully involved.

Often this perspective was easy to guess but not always.  So to make this review more valuable to the reader I would like to state my background first.  I am a 50 year old active Catholic who has slowly become disillusioned by religion starting as a child when told my Protestant friend would not go to heaven.  For years I existed on \\"faith\\" since I personally could find no evidence that God existed.  As a Catholic there is also a good helping of \\"guilt\\" for good measure.  I am also a very strong Constitutionalist and believe that the only way to get along is to have freedom of and freedom from religion.  With the recent surge of religious fundamentalism and its effects on politics I have become increasingly concerned about what Dawkins calls the American Taliban and the push for a Christian Theocracy.  This actually scares me more than Al-Qaida. The words \\"Faith\\" and \\"Belief\\" have been morphed into the word \\"Truth\\".  This new \\"Truth\\" has caused me to do a lot of searching for answers for what really is true.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins book was extremely helpful and was the first book I have read on the Atheist side of the fence.  I found Chapters 1 through 4 and 7 through 9 easy to read.  Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 10 were more scientific and a hard read for the average person.  I actually needed a dictionary at my side to get through those chapters.  I particularly liked the section in Chapter 3 on Pascal's Wager which I had mistakenly credited to Einstein in the past.<br /><br />What I had found so interesting is that he expressed ideas that I had been developing in my brain for years, but did not feel free to discuss with others. (although he can state them more eloquently than I can).  The result is that I have been pushed from a 5 to a 6 on his scale of belief.<br /><br />The book is not only preaching to the Atheist choir, but to all those who a truly open minded enough to form there own opinions about God and religion.  If you are in this category it is certainly worth purchasing.<br /><br />Previous reviews stated that Dawkins was mean spirited and blamed religion for social evils.  I did not find this to be the case, and I found that he was as fair minded as someone who believes as he does can be.to the Atheist choir, but to all those who a truly open minded enough to form there own opinions about God and religion.

B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|I've owned the orriginal recording several years ago & gave it away to a person after the Katrina aftermath. When i purchased the remaster a few months ago & played it back on my home stereo system, I was blown away by the quality of not only the recording but also all the details not heard in the original. This remaster is not only recomended by myself but for all who love music in the purest form.  I am anxiously waiting for \\"The Secret Story\\" remaster to add to my current Pat Metheny collection.  If you're a seasoned or novice PMG fan, don't wait, buy this remaster soon & you'll listen for yourself how beautiful this recording is.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I don't know where to begin, I was floored when I listened to this for the first time.  Now it seems like the millionth time that I am playing it.  There isn't one thing that I can possibly be critical of.  I thought you were unique when I purchased your very first CD.  It was so mature for such a young guy.  In this, your latest CD - Continuum - the guitar playing is a phenomena and so much like Clapton. The lyrics and how you sing them becomes hypnotic and i find myself playing the CD over and over again as i do work on my computer.  It puts me into such a mellow frame of mind.  Having said all of this, it is only fitting that i rate it 5 stars - Simply Reyna
B0001XAPY2|5.0|I must say that this is not my favorite Miyazaki film but it definitely caught my interest and my imagination still, as this great director always does.  I would not say Porco Rosso should be your first Miyazaki experience, but it's definitely one that I'm proud to have in my collection.
0743298020|5.0|Novels just do not get better than this.  Still, this is a book for serious readers who like an intricate plot well beyond the usual bestseller.  The narration reminds one of Victorian novels that used more than one storyteller and point of view.  In this book there is the initial teller, Ms. Lea, then Ms. Winter, plus letters, a long excerpt from a diary, and even a first person narration through a third person.  Yet it works.  It may sound confusing, but I never got lost or confused. <br /> <br />The story or rather stories (for there are several) intertwine perfectly.  As I read this I kept fearing that the author was not going to be able to connect and conclude the stories is some satisfying way.  She did not fail me.  There are indeed surprises.... <br /> <br />The characters are very real and distinct, despite the rather large number of important figures.  The dialogue is fine.  The ambience of the antiquarian bookstore in London, Ms. Winter's mansion, her tumbling ancestral home, etc. work nicely into the story. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have noted the connections with the Bronte sisters' works, most notably \\"Jane Eyre\\" and \\"Wuthering Heights,\\" and Daphne Du Maurier's \\"Rebecca.\\"  There are resemblances (e.g., houses that almost become characters) and internal references, but \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" stands on its own and as their equal. <br /> <br />This is a book that should last many years in readers' memories.  It will in mine.
B000060OFT|2.0|This director think he's Kubrick. Or Greenaway perhaps. Or Orson Welles maybe. Or...anyway, you know what I mean. Actually, he is a big thief: took some of many of them. A little pieces from each one. The movie overall is intense, but pretend to be something that is not for sure: a piece of art. It's fully pretentious, but at the end it's a minor movie.

B00005JPB4|4.0|\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is like so many studio prestige films, in that it is a good, possibly even great, film that could still have been so much more. The film is a success on so many levels that it will probably easily be one of the finest of the year. At its best it impressively brings a certain amount of originality and perspective to its oft filmed subject matter, asking questions and providing insights to common notions of history and its mediation. At its worst the film is a perfect example of everything it purports to decry. Eastwood's talent as a director has certainly been peaking as of late, and this film is yet another feather in his cap, but for all it does right the film still far short of all it could have been.<br /><br />I don't wish to be disparaging. \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is a great film. Go see it. It handles its material in an expert fashion, and for all its ties to such an overworked genre it obviously aspires to use the best of the genre while calling attention to its common failures. One way it achieves this is through a breaking up of the narrative of the film. Rejecting the linear narrative of the common war movie, Eastwood tells his story by inter-cutting scenes of post-war, war, and even present day, and by doing so disparages the claims to `reality' that a linear narrative naturally breeds. Much of the film centres around the battle on Iwo Jima, but an equal amount is given to scenes of the soldiers after the war, five to ten years later, in the present day, etc. What this achieves is a commitment of the film to truly tell the tale of the soldiers involved and not merely use this noble endeavour as an excuse to put out a two hour action movie. The war scenes are here and they are perhaps the goriest seen yet, but due in part to this fractured narrative, and to the particular cinematic traits of these scenes, they never come across as exploitative or unnecessary.<br /><br />One of the film's triumphs is the way in which it questions history and its ongoing mediation. Was the famous flag raising photo from Iwo Jima staged? Who was in the photo, and why the discrepancy over this? The film asks many questions about the validity of mediated history, whether through media, photography, writing etc. We see that history is always written by the victors and often by those with something to sell along with it. We also see the victims of this process through a Native American character who is used when necessary and tossed aside when not. We see also the damage done to friends, family, lover, basically actual people, by this all powerful, ultimately fictional, notion of `history'. Along with history the film also dissuades the figure of the war hero, of the glorification of war and those who fight it, and does so far more successfully than the many other films that claim to. For ultimately this glorification is yet another meditation of an event, of a situation and experience that can never be truly captured or expressed through mediation. One can try, and maybe even should, but when the meditation, the fiction, becomes reality the results, as \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" claims, can become destructive.<br /><br />With all this said, my one big complaint with the film is that it is in many ways everything it claims to oppose. The mediation of war is a main concern of the film, and yet the film never seems to question its own position. It is, after all, a movie, one of the most manipulative of mediums available. The film, if not exactly always condemning, still questions the use of an inexpressible experience (the horrors of war) for the purposes of expression. Eastwood may be telling us that to exploit war for the means of finance or easy consumption is a slippery slope, and yet I, like everyone else in the theatre, paid my admission fee to have Eastwood tell me this and try to better understand war. The narrative may be broken up, but the form of the film is not questioned enough to add true legitimacy to the film's criticism of mediation. The film has a narrative and a definite claim to `realism' and authority, and this compromises any claims it makes to the contrary. With this the film becomes, like so many others of its kind, outwardly critical and yet in many ways a part of the problem. Challenging enough to make `conscientious' films goers feel smart and self-righteous, and yet still safe enough to be nominated for Oscars.<br /><br />So yes, \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is great but I still found its shortcomings frustrating. I like that it tried to be something above typical, and yet lament that it fell short. As a Hollywood war film it is probably one of the best that can be made. As a post-modern challenge to the meditation and exploitation of history, something which was obvious attempted, it never quite hits the mark. But at least it tries, which is more than can be said for the majority of the genre. I look forward to Eastwood's follow up to this movie, taking the Japanese point of view, and hope it to be as interesting and enjoyable as this.he film's criticism of mediation.

0393324818|4.0|Most serious fans can roll off satistics about their favorite player but few realize that the numbers they cite have little to do with wins and losses. Baseball is a team sport that captures the American Spirit in ways that no other sport has been able to comprehend. Even a solid home run hitter may contribute less to putting his team in the win column than the player who can tease a base hit out of any pitcher and is able to steal his way home game after game. Likewise, a team that makes a lot of errors can still come out ahead in the win/loss talley. In Moneyball, Michael Lewis takes the reader beyond the strike zone to observe a side of baseball that few fans have noticed about this unique game. Like real life, this game is really won or lost by contributions that are not displayed on the scoreboard or written about on the Sports Page. Every member of the team contributes in ways that can only be seen by collection and analysis of statstistics. There is the so-so pitcher who can tease a base hit in every game, or the injured outfieldler who can play third base with an uncanny sense of where the ball is going to track. Lewis blends good story telling with evidence from the actual business case of the LA Angles to make this a book that avid baseball fans and hard-nosed business managers can profit from and enjoy.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Serendipity is the story of two people who cross paths at a Bloomingdale's department store near Christmas time. Sarah (Kate Beckinsale) believes in fate and destiny but is very sensitive to signals the world may be giving her. Jon(John Cusack) has simply fallen in love with this woman despite the fact that both of them are in relationships with other people. After a series of trails to see if they are fated, they lose touch. Over the years, they meet other people and both become engaged. However, despite being in love, both wonder about the mysterious person they met at Bloomingdales and go on a quest to find a haunting memory that remains unfaded through time.<br /><br />This film is very much like a classic movie romance. Crude humor is completely absent and very few sexual references are made. The romance between Jonathan and Sarah is soft and calming, but also very powerful. The events that lead them to each other are simple but exciting, leading the viewer on a roller coaster ride of anticipation and hope. This film is truly for romantics who believe that love is more powerful than anything else in the world. It is also funny with two kooky sidekicks (Molly Shannon and Jeremy Piven) and an anal department store clerk (Eugene Levy).<br /><br />Also included are some sweet deleted scenes including one psychological game that evaluates one's devotion to one's significant other. This is an inexpensive film to enjoy over and over again.
B00000AFGM|4.0|I first saw the video for The Dope Show in the 5th grade, and it opened up a new world for me. I pretended to be disgusted by manson dressed as a woman like my friends were, but i was truly fascinated by such a concept...Years later, I would buy the album. The album as a whole is inspired by David Bowie, and Ziggy Stardust. The alien theme is very cool, and it was nice to see manson revamping ziggy. I had been a fan of bowie for a long time, and it was cool to hear the influences it had on this album. This album is genius, lyrically, visually, and of course musically. <br /> <br />1. Great Big White World-Awesome way to open the album, just as 5 years was. Great chorus, beautiful wailing guitars <br /> <br />2. The DOpe Show-Nice single. Gets old after a few yeard, but still a classic. nice video. <br /> <br />3. Mechanical Animals-Nice song, with midtempo beat. Cool vocals on the chorus.  <br /> <br />4. Rock is dead-very satirical single. NOt as good as the dope show, and pretty boring. That's alright, no ones perfect. The thing that dissapoints me most is the rehashed drumming and guitar pattern used in this song...The drums are used in the beautiful people, disposable teens, and even doll dogga buzz buzz ziggety zag, while the guitar pattern is used in the latter two, as well as the fight song. <br /> <br />5. Dissasociative-Nice ballad type song. Beautiful vocals, nice guitars, very bowie chorus (space oddity)... <br /> <br />6. The speed of pain-Very pretty and tragic love song, with an alien voiced chorus. Quite emotional. I love the ending with the line \\"I hope at least we die holding hands\\"...very romantic... <br /> <br />7. Post-human-This song is alright. Sounds a bit generic, even on such an oringinal album, and almost to electronic sounding...it just doesn't feel right...good lyrics though. <br /> <br />8. I wanna dissapear-This is a really good rocker. Nice lyrics about selling out. Ties in with irresponsible hate anthem and born again. <br /> <br />9.I don't like the drugs [but the drugs like me]-nice track, with guitars essence of bowie's fame...Talks about the things americans use to numb ourselves...Has kind of a soul sound to it. very original. <br /> <br />10. New Model no. 15-Awesome guitar riff. Kinda predictable lyrics, but they are still good. pretty good song. <br /> <br />11. User Friendly-This is a good track. Talks about being used (obviously). Nice sound to it. <br /> <br />12. Fundamentally Loathsome-Probably the most emotional peice on the album. I sense that omega is dying. starts out slow, and the music is okay, but then it turns into this rocking monster with the great hook \\"shoot myslef to love you, if i loved myself i'd be shooting you\\". <br /> <br />13. THe last day on earth-A nice song. really great chorus \\"we'll be together while the planet dies\\". ANother romantic one. <br /> <br />14. Coma White-Arguably one of his best songs. It's has a great sound...slow opening riff, rocking chrous, great lyrics...it's just fantastic...
B000E1155E|5.0|One of the best albums from the UK in sometime.  The sound and intensity reminds me of The Jam which were hugely influencial.  Give the album a little bit of time, next thing you know, you'll be hard pressed to remove it from your player!
0307277887|3.0|Dexter Morgan is a blood-splatter analyst for the Miami police.  His girlfriend Rita is a single mother with two wonderful children.  His (foster) sister, Deborah, works for the Vice department, acting as a decoy for johns looking for a date, a job she hates.  When a new serial killer begins his work on Miami's prostitute population, Deborah sees her chance for advancement to Homicide.  She turns to Dexter for his help, knowing of his unique insight into the minds of such criminals.  Unknown to Deb, Dexter is a serial killer himself, carefully molded by their father to prey upon other serial killers.  But now this new killer's MO speaks to Dexter in a way that other killers have not.  Indeed Dexter finds the possibility of working with this killer almost too intriguing, as if they share the same mind.  And Dexter has caught himself sleepwalking lately, on the nights the women were murdered.    Jeff Lindsay's debut novel \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" presents an intriguing twist on the serial-killer genre.  Dexter is the archetypal literary serial killer:  arrogant, self-consciously witty, intelligent, and misanthropic.  He is incapable of real emotion, taking his only pleasure from the stalking and murder of serial killers.  His relationship with Rita is purely one of convenience to insure his pretense of normality.  His relationship with his sister is less about family and more about a sense of duty.  And yet, he's reasonably likeable.    Credit goes to author Lindsay here for shaping such a realistic and fully realized voice for his hero.  Dexter is our narrator, and Lindsay writes his narration beautifully, creating a fully fleshed out character.  Dexter is an ironic and cynical storyteller, sharing the frequent wink and a nod with the reader, by turns lapsing to the childish bit of alliteration to describe the most awful things.    Unfortunately, the plot of \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" does not quite measure up to the characters.  It's pretty standard stuff of brilliantdetective hunting the brilliant serial killer while dealing with his less-enlightened superior officers.  Admittedly, the twist of the brilliant detective also being a brilliant serial killer does add enough of a wrinkle to keep the reader along.  Further, Lindsay does have an excellent sense of pacing, and the narrative is quite thrilling.  Wisely, Lindsay does not create a hyper-ritualized killer whose methods are so elaborate as to be impractical.  His killer has a thing for ice, but is otherwise perfectly plausible.  And the possibility that the killer is Dexter himself remains throughout.  The fact that Dexter wants to join this other killer is a not-so-subtle reminder that Dexter isn't a good person.    The biggest flaw of this book is its confusing ending.  The resolution doesn't feel natural or logical, and the last few pages are a blur of events that don't quite click with anything.  The book simply stops, which rather undermines it. Further, the revelation of the villain is actually pretty cliched, undercutting the relative creativity of the novel.       Still, I did enjoy \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" enough to read its sequel.  I will also look into the new TV series based on this book.  Dexter is surprisingly enjoyable to be with, even if there's so little that is admirable in his character.  It was just the ending of the book that hurt it.

0066620996|5.0|From Good to Great was recommended to me by my talented CEO. He said to me one time 'I want to do this with our company, I know it is doable, and we are going to do it'. So I took on reading it, a bit skeptically, and it taught to me that success is, as T. A. Edison put it, 10% luck and personal talent and 90% hard work. The interesting thing is that when the 90% of work is done in the proper way, success arises. Collins' book studies the patterns found in the management of many good companies a few of which became great companies. There is over and over again the 'David VS Goliath' story of two companies, one had it all and the other had very little, and how the result of poor management of the Goliath companies led them into extinction, and how the little David companies, by a combination of good management, right team, and a strong corporate honesty, integrity and discipline were led to total success against all odds.      Collins goes on to say that success does not come from working 100 hour weeks, rather from working 40 hours weeks with all the efforts put in the right direction, with all the right people doing exactly what they were hired to do. It sounds very good, and I feel so lucky to be working in a company which is willing to put this theory into practice.    The book is well written and each chapter can be read separately. I actually read it on three consecutive Sundays while laying down in front of the Pacific Ocean, and enjoyed it from cover to cover.

014118213X|5.0|Through Forster's impressive command of the English language and advanced character development, the story of Helen & Margaret Schlegel unfolds. The sisters--who are highly educated, pensive, and artistic--become entangled with the Wilcox family--practical, unilateral capitalists--and the Basts--working class and unassuming. However, the initially subtle differences between the sisters (and how they approach love, misfortune, and personal relations) become more obvious as the novel progresses, climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high-brow English novel. (I think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end) Human nature notwithstanding, the novel's refinement, gorgeous writing, and riveting story-telling prevail to the end. I loved it!
B000002AT6|5.0|I purchased this soundtrack prior to seeing the film and thought it to be one of the great masterpieces of film scoring.Having now seen the film which was wonderful,I can now conclude that this score deserves a place among the top 5 film scores ever written.I am a great fan of James Horner's work and of film scores in general.Nearly every score he pens is a work of art.This CD contains his most perfect score.The music is sweeping and you can practically feel the cold Montana air on your face as you listen to it.You really sense as well the deep melancholy of the film in both the calm,quiet moments as well as the grand,epic ones.  The finest tracks on this excellent CD are \\"Legends of the Fall\\" which is the first track and is the basic theme that plays throughout the film.\\"The Ludlows\\" which is the following track is a stunning piece with beautiful piano and violin solos.It is the music which acts as the theme for the family in the film.\\"Off to War\\" plays with the themes a bit in the orchestration creating a new sound that conveys the big open feel of the Montana Wilderness that the men are leaving behind as they go to war.\\"Alfred Moves to Helena\\",the sixth piece,is a good example of a quiet content mood as Alfred finds some of the peace he seeks in the story by making a new life in the big city.\\"Changing Seasons,Tristan's Return\\",the eighth track,is a fum piece which achieves a very joyful sound as the Tristan character returns with great fanfare to his family after many long years.\\"The Wedding\\",track nine,is warm and romantic as Tristan is married to new love,Isabel-Two.Finally,best of all is the final track,\\"Alfred,Tristan,the Colonel,the Legend\\" for which a better title would be \\"The Legends of the Fall Suite.\\"This piece was played over the credits and in that piece Horner pulls out all the stops as every major theme is reiterated with extras.It is the longest track running at roughly fourteen minutes.Many reviewers have commented that Horner is dull and repetitive,I beg to differ.I will fully admit that many chords and sometimes whole themes are repeated in his scores.In this score,there are elements of \\"Braveheart,Field of Dreams\\",and also a little bit of \\"Titanic\\".However,it does not detract from what is unique in the overall piece.He always seems to add something to separate the piece from his others.Besides,many of his other pieces aren't nearly as good as this even if some thematic elements are the same.Horner doesn't repeat himself that much more than any other composer in Hollywood.Often,in fact,they are chosen to write a score that purposely sounds akin to a previous one.The similarities are a reflection of the style of the composer.John Williams' more action heavy scores sound very similar to one another as well.Don't nitpcick too much.Just enjoy this amazing collection of music by an amazing composer.
B0001M0A4I|5.0|There is a tendency with classical music fans to confine the definition of that style of music to the eras before they were born.  I think that is a mistake with modern composers, one of whom as shown great skill and potential for more: Mr. Tony Banks. <br /> <br />Mr. Banks' unusual chord structure in use with an orchestra creates great emotion and wonderful sense of energy. Tony Banks' style in Genesis, so unusual and adored in the progressive rock world, is shown with all grandure in the classical stylings presented in this music.   <br /> <br />I look forward to any orchestral music Mr. Banks wishes to write. <br /> <br />
B000AL730O|2.0|There are two particular problems here: First, music this minimalist needs lyrics that are incisive or clever or at least interesting in some way. These lyrics are consistently banal and in many cases inane. Second, McCartney's singing voice appears to be tired or ravaged by age or overuse. His lowest pitches (and none are THAT low) sound strained, and his higher pitches, which are mostly taken falsetto, sound thin and weak. His intonation is generally faulty; he is often painfully out of tune. Oddly enough, his singing seems to deteriorate as the record wears on, almost as if it had been recorded sequentially in one session, as I doubt it was.     There are chord relations in the first three songs (although only briefly in the first) that I never expected to find in a McCartney song. Possibly someone finally pointed out to McCartney that John Lennon's and George Harrison's Beatles songs were generally much more harmonically adventurous than his and he is seeking belatedly to even the score or possibly he is letting himself be influenced by David Bowie or by people who were themselves influenced by David Bowie. The opening of each stanza of \\"This Never Happened Before\\" (\\"I'm very sure/this never happened to me before\\") derives directly from Burt Bacharach, and McCartney unfortunately lacks the compositional technique to develop Bacharach's motive--or else he's too lazy to try. \\"A Certain Softness\\" is more or less reminiscent of Thomas Dolby's reading of \\"I Scare Myself\\" or perhaps of Brian Ferry going thirties-Latin. An otherwise pleasant-enough melody is destroyed by singing so out of tune on the critical last line of each verse that it is nearly impossible to tell what pitches were intended. \\"Follow Me\\" surrounds with filler some bits taken from George Harrison songs.    The best things about this record are Joby Talbot's tasteful, unobtrusive string arrangements and the remarkable clarity with which it has been recorded. There ought to be a law against letting McCartney touch a fipple flute, however. He murders the instrument on \\"English Tea\\" just as he once murdered it on \\"Fool on the Hill\\". The liner notes tend to be very specific--fussy, let's say--about instruments played, and although I think a \\"A Fine Line\\" one of the better songs, I'm a little saddened to learn the piano that McCartney is beating up here--banging out chords on--is an expensive, refined, and delicate Bosendorfer. Speaking of beatings, the booklet-back lengthy paragraph admonishing us not to make copies of this record (which I notice below is being blithly ignored) includes this sentence: \\"By [sic] carrying out any of these actions it [sic] has the same effect as stealing music.\\" I don't know who is responsible for mangling the English language in this way, but I shouldn't be surprised to discover it to be the author of the lyrics on this disc; I find a stylistic consistency.
B000G7PMD2|5.0|I believe this is one of the best heavy metal live albums.  The introduction is well designed to boost up the feeling that the show will bring a lot of excitement, their selection and order of the music is perfect, and the arrangement of the music is great.  The length of playing together with the Octavarium Orchestra is adequately enough and I think they used the orchestra effectively.  One thing that I do not like about this album is the package made of paper.  Every time you remove a CD from and put it back in the package is a risk of scratching the CD.  Still this is a great live album and is definitely a strong buy if you like Dream Theater, or melodious heavy metal or classical metal.
B000H30B2C|4.0|The original King Kong is one of my all time favourites.  Its spirit of adventure, its complete capture of the Depression era, the fabulous effects of Willis O'Brien--I can watch it again and again.<br />As a result, I looked forward to Peter Jackson's remake with mixed feelings--there can only be one King.<br />I saw it in theatres twice, and own the DVD.  It is a film that is at turns wonderful and very frustrating.<br />Note: this review was written for the theatrical version.  Keep reading, and at the end of the review, I will mention the 'extended' edition.<br />The first third of the film is fine, despite the criticisms of some. As in the original, it is important to spend some time with the characters before dinosaurs eat them.  The scenes on Skull Island are often hyponotically intriguing, with excellent special effects.  And Kong's end fate on top of the Empire State building is masterful.<br />Yet the flaws in the film have me grit my teeth--for what could have been.<br />The original and remake versions form an unusual comparison between their eras, and how times have changed, not always for the better.<br />Where the original was an absolute model of economy, never wasting a second, Jackson feels the need to give us our 'money's worth'.  Instead of less than two hours (the original) his is three hours, seven minutes.  The original had a spider pit sequence which the makers deleted primarily because it slowed the film down from the main plot.  Jackson sticks it back in, and then some (yes, it was an act of love for the original, but misguided love, moving the film more towards horror than adventure, which is a critical error in judgement.)<br />Jackson's Kong is very much an animal of its times, as was the original.  The original knew when to stop, but we live in an age of excess and excessive violence.  The original left 'em wanting more, the remake gives 'em more than they want.<br />The natives on Skull island in the original were well dressed, relatively civilized, and violent only in kidnapping Anne Darrow (heck, Kong has to eat, right?? Plus, he is a God).  In Jackson's remake they verge on racist stereotypes of violent savages.  Was it really necessary for one crew member to suffer a violent death?  Did the natives have to be so brutal?  Where the original was suggestively violent, the remake is much more graphic.  Obviously Jackson feels we needed to be jolted for our entertainment.  Maybe he is right, and if he is, that is so sad.<br />Jackson is not racist in his depiction of the natives, although that was my first impression.  Heck, could the natives not have been white, for that matter?  But in the end he is simply feeding into and on modern cynicism.<br />The same problem exists with how he handled the Carl Denham character.  In the original he is considered a 'harmless' adventurer, just \\"enthusiastic\\".  In the remake he is a profoundly cynical man, and a real jerk.  We are told he has cinematic talent, but what we actually see is a manipulator with no apparent talent, no care for the lives of his cast and crew, even a liar--how many times does he say that he will dedicate the film to a dead crew member and give the money to the member's family?<br />For a while I thought the problem was Jack Black, the actor.  And, indeed, perhaps in the hands of a more skilled dramatic actor the character would have come off better (what would Al Pacino have done with the part?)  But the problem is not really Black.  It is inherent in the cynical way the character has been revised.  The original Denham was likeable.  The revised Denham is despicable.<br />And don't get me started on all the slow motion stuff that Jackson inserted.  Or the misreading of The Heart of Darkness.  Or the wasting of time on crew members who only get up eaten.  The script is often lazy, and seems to demonstrate that there was no one in Jackson's inner circle willing to say \\"no\\" to the Big Fella, any more than one could say no to the hairierBig Fella.  Other lazy elements of the script include how the lead actor in the film within a film is portrayed--either he's a hero or he ain't.<br />Yet, for all that, I have watched the film several times.  I paid to see it twice in the theatres.  I bought the DVD the day it came out.  I'll probably buy the extended version.  I have the production diaries.  And the film always stops me when I come across it on a cable channel.  It is beautifully shot, often gorgeous.  The special effects are indeed special--although the sense of awe that the original had is lost in the fast cutting of the original--Jackson can't slow himself down enough, often, to just let us look.  In some ways the original was better in inspiring awe, frankly, despite all the technical ability shown in the remake.<br />However, the remake is emotionally far more involving. What the original implied, the remake fully explores.  The scenes between Darrow and Kong are excellent, and for sure Kong is a much more expressive character.  In the original we empathised with him because of our own inner feelings, whereas in the remake Kong earns our sympathy much more directly.<br />The original Kong was more a monster, the remade Kong is much more a character.  The original was awe inspiring as an animal/man creature.  There was a reason why the original Kong did not look like a gorilla, why it stood erect and did not have a pot belly.  I like both, but they are wildly different.  That is good: this is NOT a pointless remake.<br />But the remake could easily have been cut by over half an hour, and it would be far better as a result.  Sometimes less is more.<br />Yet, again, this new Kong is so clearly a labour of love that it is hard to be critical of it.  Jackson loves Kong, and it shows, over and over.  For example, in the recently released on DVD version of the original Kong, Jackson recreates the spider pit sequence.  More power to him.  Except there was a reason that sequence was cut shortly after release: it slowed the pacing and introduced a horror element.  Jackson includes it in his version, extended it and making it even more horrific--and, in the end, demonstrating that the original film's producers were wise in cutting the sequence.<br /><br />The extended edition?  Bought that too.  The film retains all the strengths and weaknesses of the theatrical version, adding a few new strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />There are two new dinosaur sequences.  The first has the crew members being attacked almost as soon as they enter the rest of the island.  It's an okay sequence, but to my mind the film worked better as it was, introducing the dinosaurs through our first seeing that herd of brontosuari (or brontosaurises, or whatever).  There was a sense of wonder in that edit, which is now lost when the dinos are introduced earlier.<br /><br />The second sequence apes (can I write that, really?) the raft/dino sequence from the original.  The sequence worked in the original and it works in the extended cut.  It's very nicely done, especially the underwater stuff.<br /><br />Those are most of the additions.  If there was five seconds of new Kong, that was about it.<br /><br />Unbelievably, the spider pit sequence is extended.  Towards the end.  We now see the 'actor' character going down into the pit to rescue people--completely unnecessary build up to his character in what was already an unbelievably character twist (if he was scared enough to leave, would he have returned?)  However, Jack Black is given a few shots to look shaken by the experience, which was good.  In the end, though, the entire spider pit sequence remains out of place--it is horror, not adventure--and slows the film's pacing.<br /><br />Too bad Jackson did not cut the stuff between the first mate and the younger crew member, which still has no decent payoff.<br /><br />It is hard to recommend spending a lot more money on the extended version if you already have the theatrical cut.  And note: in the extended version the movie is now split between two disks.  That was a pain.<br /><br />However, for some reason, the extended cut did LOOK better.  Not sure why. I have not been through all the extras, many of which are brought together here.  The Production Diaries appear to be here, for example.  Since I have a life, I haven't had the time yet to look at them all, but it is your money's worth.n includes it in his version, extended it and making it even more horrific--and, in the end, demonstrating that the original film's producers were wise in cutting the sequence.

B00003CXAY|5.0|Godfrey Reggio, Philippe Glass and Ron Fricke made a superb trilogy about human life on earth. It took them 20 years to complete their project! Only using images and (specially composed) music they are able to give an account on life on the northern hemisphere (Koyaanisqatsi), the southern hemisphere (powaqqatsi) and the synthesis of both (naqoyqatsi). I have never seen a better film without words in conveying a universal message without making a judgement!  <br />
0975991477|2.0|I am disappointed with this author. There is too much theory to wade through versus application. I wish all of these want-to-be doctor authors could use Dr. Wayne Dyer as the example. If this author would of at least had a closing summary with each chapter, filled with applications and a good review, then I would have given this author a B+, or A, which would of been four or five stars.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|One of the best DVDs I ever saw. The band is on top of its game. For sure, this is a gift from heaven. Fantastic gig!!!!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I'm not going into the plot of The Lake House.  Other reviewers have already done a much better job on that than I can.  What I will say is that I've watched this movie on DVD at least eight times since I bought it, and the story line and acting still hold up magnificently for me.  What shifts this film from being a good love story to a great love story is the ending.  I didn't see it coming, though friends of mine said that they did.  The first time that I saw the ending, it hit me with a powerful emotional punch that left me breathless and my eyes full of tears.  That made this movie a winner in my opinion.  Like many of the other reviewers, I feel that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have the right chemistry with each other, and it was wonderful seeing them together again.  I would highly recommned this film to any individual who enjoyed The Notebook, Message In a Bottle, The Horse Whisperer, and The Bridges of Madison County.  Though the writers of the film used a two-year span of time between the main characters and their relationship with each other, it's still a movie about finding that one person you can love with all of your heart.  Good stuff!!!
B00006LLOG|3.0|the songs are cool, but the bowie sound doesn't mix well with lou reed. ronson's guitars are irritating, with a horrible thin, garbled tone, and bowie's backing vocals are manic and distracting. the only song that really sounds right is the beautifully understated walk on the wild side, which is of course perfect.
0786856297|3.0|What a disappointment!  After seeing the reviews, I had high hopes for this book.  Alas, I was not prepared for the extraordinary similarity to Harry Potter.  Percy Jackson, as you will have read in the other reviews, is the young teenage son of a Greek god and a mortal woman.  He's a boy with extraordinary powers, of which he's intially unaware, living among muggl..., excuse me, ordinary people.  He goes to halfbreed camp (Hogwarts), where, with other demigods (wizards and witches), he studies the things a demigod has to know.  (No Quidditch, I was relieved to find, although \\"capture the flag\\" seems to more or less play that role.)  Then he goes on a quest with a satyr (Ron) and a teenage girl (Hermione).  There's a even a Voldemort-like evil eminence gris behind all the trouble, who we are assured will become more important in sequels.   <br /> <br />So, it's pretty similar to Harry Potter, but there are differences.  I'm not sure I'd agree that it's \\"hipper\\", as so many other reviewers say.  It's more that it's gritty and dark.  Percy was born out of wedlock, but now has a beer-guzzling, wife-beating redneck stepfather.  He's a failing student with psychological problems.  This may sound a bit like Harry and the Dursleys, but whereas the Dursleys are so exaggerated as to be comical, Percy's domestic troubles are seriously depressing.  In fact, I couldn't help feeling that the mood was borrowed from \\"Holes\\" in the same way that the plot was borrowed from \\"Harry Potter\\".  Unfortunately, Riordan doesn't have either Rowling or Sachar's sense of humor.  There are jokes in Percy Jackson, but they are forced, without delight, and they are decorations to the story, not a real part of it.
0060977493|3.0|\\"THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS\\"<br /><br />Arundhati Roy goes about describing every little minute detail with much exuberance in this story. She describes every \\"not so likable\\" character with much flair and intensity. The ugly maids, the earthen pots, the insects, the effect the rain has on huts, the ponds, the croaking frogs, the lines on a disfigured face, children, fellow Indians ,etc. While doing so, she flounders her vocabulary and uses words I've never heard before and probably never will again. And I think the first reviewer nailed it better than anyone.<br /><br />This book has an irritating continuity in characters. I ended up hating Esthappen and Rahel, not only because their characters made no moral sense but because of the fact that both are given a lot of mention in this book. Arundhati Roy must be a real sweetheart of a mother but tell me, why would I want to hear about the two most annoying mongrel of little children characters ever? Her storytelling is so irritating. It's been three months since I read this book and I cant even recall what became of the central characters. Her writing suggest one vain of thought but eventually confuses the reader. Also, there are many characters but there seems to be this boring eternal \\"stillness\\" about them. They never come to life.<br /><br />Chacko, Sophie's father was my favorite character in the book. He was downright funny especially when the writer said he seemed to have a smile on his face even he was alone. Almost like he had an imaginary friend he constantly smiled at. Baby Kochamma and Kochu Maria - were immensely irritating. Velutha, the title character, was like a fantasy book \\"Naukar\\"  ,nothing else.<br /><br />Also, I live in this country where there are many \\"Gods of Small Things\\".<br /><br />I cannot help but sense a deep pretentiousness in the writer's thought procedure. I read a few books but I seldom dislike any of my reads. I wouldn't totally dismiss this book but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone either. It has no driven force, has an admittedly deflated mood about it and overall it seems to fall flat on it's face.<br /><br />I liked the mythology bit but overall felt glad I only rented this book instead of purchasing it.

0446528056|5.0|As always I truly enjoyed Nicholas Sparks books. I found myself enthralled by the story, even towards then end when I was frustrated with Savannah. The whole time I was pulling for John and Savannah's relationship only to find it wasn't to be. An interesting story would be to read it from Savannah's perspective... what exactly happened between she and Tim to make her throw away the \\"true love\\" she had with John when he only had several months to go in the army.    If you like reading Nicholas Sparks, I recommend \\"The Time Keeper\\" by Kevin E. Cropp... another excellent NC author. Both are truly talented wordsmiths that make you feel as if you are in the moment with the characters.
0201721481|2.0|For all the hype this book has received I am pretty disappointed. I found this book to be written in a very non-engaging style, making it difficult to just follow what the author was saying. Additionally it's absolutely terribly organized.  What kind of programming book spends the first couple of chapters talking about programs that use and implement classes, and then finally halfway through the book actually tells you what a class is and how to make one.<br /><br />It's absolutely unusable as a reference, and just barely useable as a means of learning C++.  C++ is a very large and complicated programming language, and therefore books on it should do their best to be as helpful and organized as possible.<br /><br />If programming languages were books, C++ would be \\"C++ Primer\\", poorly thought out, unorganized, and unnecessarily complicated.

0743289412|3.0|Due to the fact that i read alot of books, i don't usually write reviews for each, but I just had to do it for SK.  Lisey's Story was long.....so long in fact, that I almost gave up halfway through.  BUT.....on the flip side, the last part of the book was the best!  Granted, King should have pared it down by at least 100 pages and left out \\"smucking\\", but those of you who just couldn't stomach the first part, hang in there..it does get better.  The middle is long and boring, but the part about Amanda and Lisey at the end makes it worth your while!
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|I enjoyed the songs on this CD very much.  It has a variety of styles from country to rock to pop and blues.  I would recommend it to anyone even if not a Ray Charles fan.  There are superstars singing and or playing on every selection.
0671646788|5.0|A friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right. It is one of the most underrated books out there. It's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old. The real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives. One of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity. Buy it, read it and pass along to your friends and family.  <br /> <br />
B000AU9UYM|5.0|This is pretty much the greatest comic book adaption ever made!Batman Begins is an epic!The story is so great!The acting is top-notch!This is as close to the comic book as you can get.Christopher Nolan did a excellent job at actually capturing the myth and personality of Batman on film.Christian Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly,truly like no other before him.All the actors play their parts extremely well,as if they were born for the roles!Batman Begins is an instant classic film,that no doubt will be talked about and remembered for years to come.If you havent bought this movie already,I advise that you add it to your collection!It is truly a must have!
B00005JPC7|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was very interesting and I think it was well casted. This proves that Will Ferrell is also a great serious actor. If you're looking for another Anchorman or Old School, you won't find it here but definitely worth a watch.

James Frey is an amazing author. Putting all the \\"drama\\" aside about everything that went on, I really and truly enjoyed this book!
0375703764|5.0|I first got this book when my friend casually mentioned it in conversation. It sounded like something new and interesting so I picked it up when I got the chance. What I found was nothing near what I had expected. Several stories all blended into one provided the base for what makes this such a mind boggling book. The structure and style of Mark Z. Danielewski is really what scrambles the brain and makes the reader question what is real and what is fake. While reading it, I could feel the same paranoia that was rising in Johnny and the terror going on in the house plays on that paranoia. I will say though that this book is not for every reader. Those who must read a page in the standard one page after another style will not make it far in HoL. Those who are up for Danielewski's literary maze will certainly be in for a treat.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|\\"Animal I Have Become\\" has been playing over and over on the local hard rock station.  Every time I heard it, I knew I had to have it so I wrote down as many lyrics I could and looked them up on the Internet and found Three Days Grace.  I am glad I did!  Awesome album from beginning to end!  One of the best and most solid CDs I've gotten in the last ten years!  It has been living in my CD player for months now and I still can't get enough.  I definitely recommend it!  The CD booklet opens up to reveal the dark artwork of social angst, a nice (but small) full color photo of the band, and lyrics. Here are the tracks:<br /><br />\\"It's All Over\\":  Excellent, exploding opener with a beefy sound.  Apparently about watching a friend destroy him/herself (\\"And it gets under my skin to see you giving in\\").  It's not the best track here, but is an appropriate, energetic song to open the album.<br /><br />\\"Pain\\":  Slow verses with explosive chorus.  A little repetitive with somewhat contrived lyrics \\"Pain! I like it rough `cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all\\").  I like the verses and the bridge.<br /><br />\\"Animal I Have Become\\":  Love it!  The reason I bought this CD.  Clear and deliberate vocals with heavy guitar.  Flat out kicks!  Still my favorite.<br /><br />\\"Never Too Late\\":  Beautiful acoustic guitar and blending vocals.  A wonderful power ballad at the verses that explodes at the chorus.  Inspirational lyrics that are serious but not sappy: \\"Even if I say / it will be all right / Still I hear you say / you want to end your life / Now and again we try / To just stay alive / Maybe we'll turn it around / Cause it's not too late / It's never too late.\\"<br /><br />\\"On My Own\\":  Another track that starts slow and then rocks!  The part before the chorus that brings up the intensity is my favorite. Great vocals there. The chorus is a bit stilted. I also like the bridge to this track.<br /><br />\\"Riot\\": This style of music may not be the best to create an effective riot song, but they try.  It is probably the heaviest track on the album.  Still the chorus \\"Let's start a riot!\\" doesn't sound too convincing, but we probably wouldn't want it to be.  The lyrics to the verses are better: \\"If you feel so empty / So used up, so let down / If you feel so angry / So ripped off, so stepped on / You're not the only one / Refusing to back down / You're not the only one / So get up\\"  The driving guitar riff and brief solo almost sounds like old school metal. Some almost Ill Nino-esque screaming incorporated in this track, too.<br /><br />\\"Get Out Alive\\": Dark opening.  A nice, slow track with an excellent bridge.  The lyrics at the chorus bug me a little because it sounds like he's singing \\"If you want to get a life, run for your life,\\" (uh, yeah); but he's actually singing \\"If you want to get out alive, run for your life\\" but it doesn't sound like it.<br /><br />\\"Let It Die\\": Very accessible, mainstream-sounding track.  Nice, laid-back sound at the verses.  I like the blunt lyrics about the fire extinguishing from a relationship: \\"I swear I never meant to let it die / I just don't care about you anymore.\\"<br /><br />\\"Over and Over\\": Very memorable song.  It is slower and accessible like \\"Let It Die.\\"  It also has some orchestration in the background.<br /><br />\\"Time of Dying\\": I like this track a lot.  It has a very catchy, sing-along to chorus.<br /><br />\\"Gone Forever\\":  This song is OK, it's not one of my favorites here.  The lyrics are more memorable than the music.  The chorus is not as good as the ones of other tracks on this album.<br /><br />\\"One X\\":  This final track sums up the underlying theme of this CD:  disappointment in where life has gotten one to.  But this song gives a positive message that things might get better: \\"We are the ones / We get knocked down / We get back up / And stand above the crowd / We are one.\\"  The end of it: \\"We stand above the crowd\\" background, is a little sappy, though.It is probably the heaviest track on the album.  Still the chorus \\"Let's start a riot!\\" doesn't sound too convincing, but we probably wouldn't want it to be.  The lyrics to the verses are better: \\"If you feel so empty / So used up, so let down / If you feel so angry / So ripped off, so stepped on / You're not the only one / Refusing to back down / You're not the only one / So get up\\"  The driving guitar riff and brief solo almost sounds like old school metal.

B00000J2SQ|4.0|A lot of Rainbow fans seem to dislike this record but I think it's awesome!  I only have five Rainbow records, but this one is my favorite so far.  It's just a feel good, fun, rock n roll album.  It doesn't offer those long, complex, epic numbers like \\"Stargazer,\\" but it is a solid album of excellent tracks including two of my all-time favorites \\"Stone Cold\\" and \\"Bring on the Night (Dream Chaser).\\"  There is only one track I'm not too crazy about (\\"Rock Fever\\") but the rest are great.  Joe Lynn Turner has an amazing voice and it, of course, features the guitar legend Ritchie Blackmore.  The worst part about this album is, actually, the cover.  Rainbow is not known for the best album covers (i.e. \\"Difficult to Cure\\"), but this one is hideous!  Oh well, it's what's inside that counts and here's what's inside: <br /> <br />\\"Death Alley Driver\\" (4:36): Fast and furious opener.  Killer guitar and keyboard solos.  I really like the overall sound of this one and I think the keyboards really stand out.  I guess I'm one of the few fans who like keyboards in hard rock and metal. <br />\\"Stone Cold\\" (5:15): From the first guitar riff, this song rules!  Soft and delicate in places and catchy rocker in others.  Excellent use of keyboards, too. <br />\\"Bring on the Night (Dream Chaser)\\" (4:02):  I love this song!  This one and \\"Stone Cold\\" are my favorites on this album (and also favorite songs all-time).  It just flat out kicks!  The sweeping sound right before the chorus is cool! <br />\\"Tite Squeeze\\" (3:15): This song is OK.  I can listen to it.  It is just an average, straight-forward rock song.  Nothing sets this song apart like most of the others on this record. <br />\\"Tearin' Out My Heart\\" (4:00): Slow, power track. <br /> <br />\\"Power\\" (4:23): This track kicks!  Like with \\"Dream Chaser\\", my favorite part is right before the chorus.  The intensity is built with flying percussion.  Double bass would've been even better. <br />\\"MISS Mistreated\\" (4:25): Another of the better tracks.  Guitar solo a highlight as well as the bass.  I also like the use of keyboards.  A medium-tempo song. <br />\\"Rock Fever\\" (3:40): The only track here I don't care for.  The chorus is just stale, good-time rock n roll.  \\"Lemme see you rock, lemme see you roll, lemme see you burn.\\"  No originality. <br />\\"Eyes of Fire\\" (6:41):  The closest to an epic track on this album.  It has an interesting sound.  I wonder if Bruce Dickinson had this song in mind when he wrote Iron Maiden's masterpiece \\"Powerslave.\\"  They have the same Egyptian tune.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana Krall is simply the best contemporary singer to interpret this collection of great standards.  From her throaty, torchy renditions to her supurb piano playing she represents a much welcome return to the way it should have always be done.<br /><br />It is getting difficult to find good jazz in the classic mode.  For the purists, this is your disc.
B00000J2SO|3.0|Down to Earth came out in 1979 and featured the vocals of Graham Bonnet who was and still is a real hunk (I don't know about his brain but he looks all right--haha) and has an amazing voice.  One of the many great vocalists in Rainbow's history.  Of the eight tracks on this album, five I would consider to be excellent while three I could take or leave.  I don't like this album as much as I like 1982's Straight Between the Eyes with Joe Lynn Turner, but it is a very good record from that time just before the glorious 1980s.  Plus, it features Ritchie Blackmore, of course, so you know it rocks. <br /> <br />\\"All Night Long\\" (3:49): Hard rockin' opener about a groupie who knows just what (rather who) she wants.  \\"I need a girl who can keep her head all night long\\" indeed.  You also gotta like the line \\"Don't know about your brain but you look all right.\\"  Honesty in a rock song, what more could you want? <br />\\"Eyes of the World\\" (6:36): Complex, epic track, almost progressive.  Amazing vocal performance and cool keyboards at the bridge.  A lot of depth to this one. <br />\\"No Time To Lose\\" (3:41): The drums are actually my favorite part of this song.  Too much good time rock n roll sound for my tastes.  One of my least favorites. <br />\\"Makin' Love\\" (4:36): I really like the verses to this track.  It is a slower-paced number.  Bonnet sings with a lot of passion. I also like how the drums kick into the bridges. <br /> <br />\\"Since You've Been Gone\\" (3:10):  Nice, short, radio-friendly single.  Very catchy with addictive guitar riffs.  I'm not sure how well it has aged.  I guess it might be considered cheesy today, but I still think it kicks. <br />\\"Love's No Friend\\" (4:52): I'm not that crazy about this song.  It is slow and plodding and kind of drags. <br />\\"Danger Zone\\" (4:30): I do not like the chorus on this track.  The verses are better with the driving guitar notes and the guitar solo is a highlight as well.  The background vocals are annoying and it's repetitiveat the end. <br />\\"Lost in Hollywood\\" (4:51): Definitely ends the album on a positive note.  This track flat out rocks!  Bonnet's vocals kick major you-know-what.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the musical and it has surpassed my previous favorite musical, \\"Chicago.\\"  Although, I am a HUGE Wizard of Oz fan that I was hooked at the title alone.  After seeing the show, I had to have the soundtrack, which is phenomenal.  In addition, my 2 and a half year old daughter listens to this CD every night at bedtime.  I highly recommend it.
0743454537|4.0|A very interesting probe into a practice that is not too far from home. Any parent can identify with the pain of having a child with health problems, and the moral dilemna of having to choose one child over another is full of anguish. Well written and enjoyed by all I have shared this with.
B00081MUY0|3.0|I bought this album because I remembered it as one of my favorites when I owned it on vinyl... a long time ago.  Listening to it again after all these years, though, was not entirely a happy homecoming.  Several of the songs (\\"Sunshine Superman\\", \\"Season of the Witch\\", and \\"Bert's Blues\\", among others) really stood the test of time for me and remain classics of the genre, while others just seemed to drag on and on in a fog of monotony.  The \\"unicorns and fairies\\" flavor of some of the songs, which seemed enchanting and new on the original release, suffer now from decades of plastic figurines and tacky posters in cheap mall stores; it's really impossible to hear them without that filter of kitsch at this point. <br /> <br />Perhaps my least favorite feature of the album, however, is the group of \\"bonus tracks\\" at the end; suffice it to say that it's easy to see why these weren't included on the original release.  I think the bad taste left in my mouth at the end of the album is in large part due to these cuts, and I probably would have had a much more positive review overall even with the caveats of the first paragraph if not for this feature.  In fact, I'm thinking of taking the trouble to burn a copy of the album that ends where the original one did, so that I don't have to remember to turn it off there manually.
0446615625|3.0|The plot is quite inventive and the mystery goes on until about the middle of the book. However, once the mystery is revealed, and the plan's details fall into the open, the author takes way too much time to reveal the cataclasmic event.  The book would have been much better with fewer details and more character development.  Not a best for David.
B000GPIPSS|4.0|For good or ill, the 1931 DRACULA with Bela Lugosi is the one most ingrained in public consciousness.  A number of 19th Century novels have unusual story structure or styles which do not easily \\"translate\\" to stage plays or movies; this no doubt accounts for thw wild variances in many of the (ahem) \\"adaptations\\".  What I find fascinating is that DRACULA, more than most, has inspired such a wide range of often completely different films, all based on the same source material-- and so MANY of them are so utterly fascinating to watch (and compare!)    The opening sequences in the '31 version continue to surprise me for being visually spectacular.  The views of the countryside, the castle with that seemingly-impassible road leading up to it, and especially the castle's interiors-- WOW!!!  I can't recall Dracula's castle EVER looking this HUGE, this IMPOSING, this... utterly decaying.  I feel I'm missing so much having never seen it on a big screen as it was intended.    The story in the stage play (& film) got compressed and simplified to an almost insane degree.  Things happen lightning-fast in this version, though it doesn't seem like it, because the 3 main principles, Dracula, Renfield & Van Helsing all seem to be moving & talking in slow motion, as if, with their intimate knowledge & experience with the undead, they're all living in their own separate world from the rest of us \\"mere mortals\\". And they're all more fascinating to watch-- it seems Jonathan Harker is dull and boring in EVERY film version.  In the book, all the sequences involving Dr. Seward's sanitarium and Renfield seem like a badly-thought-out, tacked-on subplot that never goes anywhere, the kind of thing a good book editor would have insisted be cut before publication.  I suspect this is why most film versions have tried to do something interesting with him, if he's in the film at all.  In this case, Renfield's character takes the place of Harker as the poor solicitor who unsuspectingly travels to Transylvania and becomes Dracula's first victim, going mad on their way back to England together.  It adds an \\"explanation\\" for Renfield that simply was not in the book-- but it makes Harker even LESS memorable, to the point that for years I genuinely could not remember his having been in this film at all!    Having just watched the film again (I've lost count how many times), I was surprised at the way Lucy DISAPPEARS as soon as she becomes a victim.  After showing her as a vibrant, more interesting person than Mina was, and her fascination with the Count (Mina kids about a possible marriage between them), next thing she's DEAD!  No build-up, no increasing tension as her condition worsens-- all that's saved for Mina's character.    Structurally, the last 1/3rd of the film feels the most like watching a stage play-- most of it takes place entirely within Seward's house.  It's all in the hands of Lugosi, Frye & Van Sloan to hold our attention.  The only visually arresting scene near the end is when Renfield foolishly seeks out Dracula to beg him NOT to kill him-- and gets killed ANYWAY by being hurled down one of the longest and most dangerous-looking flight of stairs I've ever seen in a movie!    It's a tragedy that, due to behind-the-scenes problems, Lugosi did not return in the sequel, DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (even though he was on retainer and paid MORE for it that the original-- no wonder Universal was bought out in a hostile takeover that year).  The book's climax, which takes place back in Transylvania, was used in the 2nd film, but without any sign of the book's title character.  (For that, one must see HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN-- as, after repeated viewings, I've concluded the Chaney Jr. film, SON OF DRACULA, must take place a few films later than when it was made.)  Lugosi would finally return in the much-loved Abbott & Costello movie, somehow a lot livelier than seen in his eerie, unearthly performance here.    I've only seen the \\"Spanish\\" version once, but it's a BLAST.  Apparently the same script, sets and crew were used, but a different director, actors, and slightly different costumes.  Better use is made of some sets-- part of Carfax Abbey seen ONLY in Lugosi publicity stills actually turns up in the action, and the women's costumes look closer to what you expect from Hammer than Universal at the time!  But my favorite bit is when Renfield is hurled OFF the staircase and falls STRAIGHT down to his death.  That's gotta hurt.    I wish I could comment on the varying picture & sound quality of the different DVD releases, but from reading other reviews, it seems to me somebody is NOT doing their job with a \\"proper\\" restoration.  Sound on a new version NOT as good as an earlier one?  That's like special-effects \\"composite\\" shots being MORE noticeable on a VHS or DVD reissue than they EVER were in the theatre (YES I'm talking about the STAR WARS films).    By the way, for the \\"real\\" Dracula story, check out the 1976 BBC version with Louis Jordan and the AMAZING Frank Finlay... or, find the book-on-tape narrated by Robert Powell.  Both HIGHLY reccomended!
1573223026|3.0|The author does a great job with the character development.  The reader feels he truly knows the characters.  However, the story itself, needs something more.  It wasn't a terrible read, but not a good one, either.
1400032717|4.0|Mark Haddon presents a completely different perspective of the world through Christopher Boone, a brilliant child coping with an undefined learning disability or mental condition. Despite that, Christopher sees and appreciate life's details that we take for granted. Haddon communicates to his reader through Christopher in subtle ways and causes the reader to reflect on life and relationships.  A fascinating and easy read that impacts the reader in ways never imagined. Bravo to Haddon!
B000GI3KHQ|5.0|I own a few copies of the movie on VHS. I have been waiting for several years for the people in charge to decide that the film was good enough to be released on DVD. Based on the reviews I've read of the DVD's quality, however, my VHS copies of the movie seem state of the art. To those who complained on this site, I want to thank you. Maybe if every reviewer indicates their displeasure with this atrocious abomination to the arts and to those who made the film, somebody will hear us. Almost as an aside at this point to the film, it is one of the greatest films of all time, and certainly deserving of an Oscar for Robert Ryan. I can't think of one actor who could have rendered Claggart's character more chilling than Ryan did. I don't think the film would have been as realistic with any other actor. He really could depict despair and sadness better than almost any other actor.
B000002UB3|5.0|I won't bore you with another long winded review telling you how great the Beatles are, and how wonderful this CD is. I think most fans can agree that Abbey Road is one of the band's finest efforts.    To understand my review and why I love this record so much, you have to go back in time to the pre-digital era of analog vinyl records. For older Beatles fans like myself, many of our musical memories \\"revolve\\" around playing records in their original form, on vinyl LP and 45rpm records.     I think to fully appreciate Abbey Road, you have to visualize the record the way the Beatles intended you to hear it. What I mean is, unlike today's CDs where you listen from beginning to end without a pause, LP's had two sides and there was a natural beginning and end to each side of the record.  The Beatles and producer George Martin crafted this record to be almost two separate records in one. The first side was to please John Lennon, who wanted a more basic Rock n Roll record with a harder edge. Songs such as \\"Come Together\\" and \\"She's so Heavy.\\" give you a clear idea of the sound Lennon was looking for. The second side was mainly to please McCartney's ideas for this record and the contrast to Side A is apparent.      Side two started with Harrison's \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" (my favorite song on this record) and finishes with the appropriately titled song, \\"The End\\". All the songs on side two blend magically together to form one continuous piece of music. It's really incredible!    If you start your CD player with \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and listen all the way thru, you may understand why I think this is the greatest 30 minutes in Beatles recording history...
B000HT386M|3.0|Michael Newman would appear to have the perfect life. He has kind children who love him, a sweet, lovely wife, and he is soon to make partner in the architectural firm where he works. But is he happy? Not exactly. His life will not be complete until he gets a universal remote so he won't get the ceiling fan confused with the television.<br /><br />He visits Bed, Bath, and Beyond (way Beyond) and meets up with eccentric Morty, who finds just what he was looking for. Michael happily takes the remote home only to find that it controls EVERYTHING, just like it would on a DVD player. There is pause, fast forward, commentary, and more.<br /><br />Like many others would probably do, Michael fast forwards through the mundane. (Traffic jams, sleepovers, fights with his wife, even late night massages.) He is then placed on \\"auto-pilot,\\" ---there, but not really there. What happens next is that Michael gets exactly what he wished for, and more than he bargained for.<br /><br />The reason I gave it three stars, (no more, no less) is because the idea was great. Even though it seemed to be copying the Jim Carrey movie, \\"Bruce Almighty,\\" I was told by a friend that it had everything: laughs, emotions, and it made you think. Yes, it did have all of those things, but it probably could have been executed better. The laughs weren't all that funny. The dog jumping on and \\"riding\\" the stuffed animal got old. Adam Sandler in a fat suit (because he ate too many Twinkies) was not at all funny. When is Hollywood going to get it? Being overweight is not something to be laughed at. Hearing the neighbor boy cussing everyone out and brag about all of the stuff his dad bought and then crying to his mom was unrealistic.<br /><br />I did like the whole \\"message\\" and it even made me cry a little. It reminds you that we should appreciate everything (even the annoying person in the car next to you singing at the top of their lungs.) That's me!<br /><br />But, at times the \\"humor\\" left a bad taste in my mouth.e in my mouth.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|What really bothers me about this record, other then the lame title and cover graphics, is that EMI and McCartney felt it more necessary to spend the time, money and effort to release this \\"revisionist\\" version of Let it Be, than to remaster and release the entire Beatles catalog.    For years Beatle fans have been patiently waiting for the newly remastered CDs to be released, but instead we get \\"teased\\" with albums like Beatles 1, the Yellow Submarine Songbook, Let it Be..Naked, the Capitol box sets and the soon to be released Love soundtrack.    I have most of the above mentioned records and they sound great to me.  But why in the world are they releasing these records FIRST, before releasing the remastered back catalog?    Today you can purchase a remastered copy of McCartney's worst solo record \\"Wings: Wild Life\\", but you still can't purchase a remastered copy of such Beatles classics as Revolver or Abbey Road.  That's hard to believe!     Why the remastered CDs have still not been released is a mystery to me, but I'm sure it has to do with the two things that seem to characterize Apple Corp these days- greed and lawsuits!  Sorry if that sounds harsh to some fans, but I feel its true.    What a shame that in almost 2007, we still don't have modern remastered CDs from the greatest band in Pop/Rock history.    Is anyone at Apple Corp listening?
B001GF8WPI|5.0|\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is excellent! Will Ferrell gives one of his best performances of his career, thus far. He leads an extraordinary cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman (who worked with Forster on \\"Finding Neverland\\" (2004), Queen Latifah, and Emma Thompson. The directing by Marc Forster (who directed movies such as \\"Finding Neverland\\", \\"Stay\\" (2005), & \\"Monster's Ball\\" (2001) is excellent. The story and screenplay by Zach Helm in his writing debut is excellent. The music by Britt Daniel & Brian Reitzell (also the music supervisor, he also did the music to \\"Friday Night Lights\\" (2004) is excellent! The cinematography by Roberto Schaefer (who has done the cinematography to Forster's \\"Stay\\", \\"Finding Neverland\\", & \\"Monster's Ball\\") is excellent. The film editing by Matt Chesse (who has done the film editing to Forster's \\"Stay\\", \\"Finding Neverland\\", & \\"Monster's Ball\\") is excellent. The casting by Francine Maisler (who was the casting director on Forster's \\"Stay\\") is excellent. The production design by Kevin Thompson (who did the production design to Forster's \\"Stay\\") is excellent! The art direction by Craig Jackson is excellent. The set decoration by Ford Wheeler is excellent. The costume design by Frank L. Fleming (who was the costume designer on Forster's \\"Stay\\" & \\"Monster's Ball\\") is excellent. This is an excellent film that is different than \\"The Truman Show\\" and \\"Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind\\", both which starred Jim Carrey.
B0000X61VE|2.0|Cindy is more concerned about looking really sexy on the video than about explaining to you the right form to do the excercices.  She bounces too quickly from one to another.  I am well experienced on aerobics both at home and at the gym, and really don't understand her rush. Its better to do the moves correcly and slowly... the work out its just the same but it is safer. <br /> <br />Definitelly NOT for beginers. Yes, you can use the pause button, but who wants to do the workout with the remote control on one hand and the 5lb weight on the other? <br /> <br />Maybe THE FIRM features the fashion form the 80's, but it is a much more complete workout and you can be sure you are doing it right because the video actually SHOWS you how to move with REAL and explanations.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JPC4|5.0|\\"A Good Year\\" is excellent! Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe (Crowe won the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance in said movie) reteam for the first time since, \\"Gladiator\\" (2000), their next movie together will be \\"American Gangster\\" (2007), which will also star Denzel Washington. Both Scott's directing and Crowe's acting are excellent, as usual. The screenplay by Marc Klein (who also wrote the story and screenplay to \\"Serendipity\\" (2001), based on the story by Peter Mayle, is excellent. The music by Marc Streitenfeld (who is composing the music to Scott's upcoming \\"American Gangster\\") is excellent. The cinematography by Philippe Le Sourd is excellent. The film editing by Dody Dorn (who also has film edited Scott's \\"Matchstick Men\\" (2003) & \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\" (2005) is excellent.  The casting by Antoinette Boulat & Jina Jay (both who worked with Scott on \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\") is excellent. The production design by Sonja Klaus (who has worked as a set decorator on Scott's films) is excellent. The art direction by Robert Cowper (who worked as an art director on Scott's \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\") & Frederic Evard is excellent. The set decoration by Barbara Perez-Solero (who was an assistant art decorator on Scott's \\"Kingdom Of Heaven\\") is excellent. The costume design by Catherine Leterrier is excellent. This is a different movie after Scott's and Crowe's \\"Gladiator\\", which was a historical epic that was violent and bloody. This is as light as they have ever been together, and it works out excellent.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Waking Life is perhaps one of the most amazing \\"not-films\\" I've ever watched. Don't be decieved by the DVD box suggesting that it's a movie. It's a motion picture as art. This film lacks everything a film should have: story, characters, plot, conflict, climax, everything. Then why do I give it five stars? Because it's not about the story, it's about the experience. It's not about the characters, it's about the ideas expressed by the people on the screen. It's not about the plot, it's about being totally mesmerised by the innovative rotoscopy animation. The film is a 100 minute acid trip and you don't get any of the harmful side effects that real LSD poses. Simply just a prolonged disconnection from the world as we know it allowing us to escape from all of the pressures of everyday existence and just be and think and live as a worryless lump of matter for a short while. The worst part about the movie is that if you start watching, it reaches a point that it is over.<br /><br />Director, Richard Linklater, takes us through a montage of of discussions from people on the screen about scores of philosophical, metaphysical and anthropoligical issues: existentialism, evolution, free will, language, dreams, death, life, reincarnation, pessimism, and so much more. This is not a traditional film. Throughout the whole run of the piece we are simply assaulted with philosophical monologue that may be boring or intellectually stimulating, pretentious or profound, tiresome or envigorating. Either way, I feel that it is a great way to just feel so disconnected and freed from the world for a little while. Among other elements of the film, the rotoscopy animation and the enchanting soundtrack by Tosca Tango Orchestra aids in this effect of disconnection, almost making the viewer feel like he or she is floating. It's important to understand the context of this film. It was released just after 9/11, when everyone needed a break from reality for a little while. Some may feel that presently we are all in need of a break from reality. Whatever the case may be, this is a film that may not be easily recieved by all people of all times. I gave this movie five stars. Covering every point that I just covered, I just as easily could have given it one. The only possible way that one can judge whether they will appreciate or scoff at this work of art is simply to experience it.re all in need of a break from reality.

B000J10ERO|4.0|First up... yes, it is a good movie. We expected nothing less from Bryan Singer (right), who did us proud with the first two X-Men movies. But is it a great movie? One that's worthy of the Superman franchise (ignoring movies three and four)?<br /><br />Unfortunately, no. I could sum it up by saying: this movie is simply not clever or original enough, although it rides eloquently on the coat tails of the legend.<br /><br />So what's the problem? Why didn't it hit the stratospheric highs I was expecting?<br /><br />Casting is superb... Routh plays the Man of Steel to perfection, surpassing Christopher Reeve in the role (he has a deeper voice, better physique, and is a wonderful actor to boot). Bosworth as Lois Lane is surprisingly mature, and (my biggest surprise) Frank Langella as Perry White is wonderfully realised.<br /><br />But the script... once again, Lex Luthor is a property mogul, looking to score big in the property boom with his own private island (ring any bells?). And the huge, gigantuan, seat-rumbling battle between Superman and something equally evil? It just isn't there. The worst it gets is Supes getting beaten up by three alleyway thugs... ho hum.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you should. I'm a confessed Superman nut, so I'm always going to find fault with any interpretation. But just don't expect to be standing on your seats cheering... it's just not that type of movie.<br /><br />Sad, but true.
B000301YY8|5.0|I heard/watched James Blunt video \\"You are beautiful\\" many times a few months before the album debut in the USA.  It was very hard for me to listen to becuse the lyrics were so touching that it made me dearly miss my wife and daughters. <br /> <br />I bought this cd as soon as it was available.  It is falls in the catagory of pop ballads.  The music is much to emotional to dance to but is catchy.  His singing is good but the song writing is like poetry and his voice brings a honest and emotional touch. <br /> <br />This Cd is loaded with good songs:  Goodbye my lover, Wiseman, Cry and No bravery and of course You are beautiful  <br /> <br />I am not sure if his next album will be this full of emotion.  But I look forward to it.   <br /> <br />I prefer the un-edited \\"explicit version\\" it is fairly safe only a handfull of F words sprinkled to excentuate the emotion.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie isn't to satisfy want for explosions or car chases, rather, it actually makes you think. The main character goes from 'interview' to 'interview' and the audience is presented with several points of view on life, death, and dreams. Then the lines of wakefulness and dreams begin to blur.
B000GFLE86|5.0|Madeleine Peyroux has a sensuous voice with hints of Billie Holliday.  The sirens who lured sailors from the wine dark seas may have sounded like this.  She takes old standards like The Summer Wind and familiar pop tunes and makes makes them sound like they were written just for her.  This collection is more mellow and relaxed than Carefree Love.  I could listen to it every day.  I would, however, like to see her next effort edgier, like an intimate concert in which she can respond to the audience.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|I wish I could say I have now read both of Obama's books--but I have not. I only finished this one recently, and it has been out there for some time. Now I do want to get to his follow-up--because this is one extraordinary man to watch.<br /><br />Who is Barack Obama?<br /><br />He is every man.  Or maybe, as was said recently about the late Ed Bradley, Mr. Obama is a \\"minority\\". A \\"minority\\" in the sense that not so often do we see a person of such integrity and character rolled into one. And I don't think it is any accident this man is of two races.<br /><br />What I found so compelling about Obama's book is his gnawing need to know his father. It seems there is a crises among men (and boys, too) these days. That to know one's father is key to understanding one's manhood. (maybe it's the same for women, but it sure seems that men today need elders!) And it is so important for men like Obama to share that experience because so many men today grow up in homes without knowing their fathers due to divorce, abandonment, and in some cases early death or imprisonment. A totally worthy read I wholeheartedly recommend.
0553802534|4.0|Lisa Gardner is one of my favorite authors but this isn't her best work.  I wish she would have fully explained a lot more and made the book a little longer.  It's almost like she needed to get it done for her publisher.  I'm not going to write a plot summary since other reviewers and Amazon has already did that for you.  But this was a great idea for a book but she needed to develop it a little further which is why I can't give it a 5.  I really enjoyed the character of Bobby Dodge.  I thought that he was trying to find his way and do the best he could under the circumstances.  I was glad to hear that Ms. Gardner is going to write another book about him.  I would recommend this to any new readers to Ms. Gardner and to any old readers but don't expect Rainey or Quincy in this book.

I've enjoyed the sparse use of made-up language in his other books, but this is too much.<br /><br />It demeans Lisey.  It comes off as childish and affected.  The reviews attempt to justify it as showing the deep, loving bond between Lisey and Scott.  Well, so does a healthy sex life, but that doesn't mean we need to see it on every page.<br /><br />There may be a hell of a story buried in this book, but this is one Constant Reader who's taking a pass this time.
B00005JPC4|4.0|Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) has no time for leisure. He's a cold, calculating businessman, ready to make yet another fortune as the head trader for a London-based stock exchange. For him, it's never about commitment, loyalty, or trust; it's all about gaining the upper hand and coming out on top (financially speaking, of course). If that involves ruining a few careers, then so be it. How can someone of such little humility handle the rediscovery of his past, especially if it was a happy one? This is the premise behind Ridely Scott's \\"A Good Year,\\" a sweet and surprisingly witty film that makes an emotional statement without getting heavy on sentimentality. It's a story of both hidden and personal truths, none seeming attainable, all having funny ways of making themselves known.    What I enjoyed most about this movie was Russell Crowe's performance, a near perfect combination of hard-nosed ambition, arrogance, and humor. He gives Skinner a charm that's undeniable, pretty much to the point of making the audience forget how unlikable a character he is. How interesting for a man of such low standards. Only someone dependent on financial success could unflatteringly refer to his coworkers as lab rats. Only a career-oriented workaholic would give his date the boot by telling her he's engaged. Only a competitive moneymaker would take a death in the family as seriously as he takes his freewheeling love life. This is Max Skinner in a nutshell: completely focused on success without giving any thought to a personal life.    The death that he initially refuses to take seriously is that of his uncle, Henry (seen in flashback and played by Albert Finney). For Skinner, it's merely another opportunity to make money; Henry lived most of his life in a Provence chateau, complete with a sprawling vineyard and a well-stocked cellar of homemade wine (one of which tastes awful, the other of which is exceptionally rare). Skinner has inherited everything, not only because Henry hadn't updated his will in over twenty years, but because Henry believed that his nephew was his only living blood relative, as well (what happened to the rest of the family--most notably Skinner's parents--is never explicitly stated). Skinner fails to see the sentimental value of the estate; his only goal is to sell it as quickly as possible. That way, he can get on with his life.    What he seems to be forgetting is that he grew up on that vineyard. Interwoven throughout the film are Skinner's flashback sequences, all of which show him as an active and happy--if a little headstrong--child (played by Freddie Highmore). Here enters a much needed dose of emotional depth and complexity; Henry clearly had a special relationship with his nephew, one that was not defined by hugs and kisses so much as it was defined by words of wisdom. The life lessons didn't cease even when they play a game of tennis; one particular scene shows how badly young Max reacted to losing. He slams his racket on the net. He pounds his feet in frustration. He yells immaturely. Henry calmly tells him that one must be just as graceful with his losses as he is with his victories. It's a good piece of advice, but the audience already knows that Max will remain bitter.    The scene also allows the audience to understand the present day Skinner, if only just a little better. Being such a sore loser as a child understandably molded him into the no-holds-barred businessman he currently is. However, that still doesn't explain why he's willing to sell this property. Was he not the happiest during his years there? Didn't his uncle mean anything to him? These are questions he'll eventually have to struggle with. He'll also have to struggle with repressed feelings that for years enabled him to forget the life he once had. The time spent on such thoughts becomes crucial; his personal assistant, Gemma (Archie Panjabi) is quick to point out that selling the chateau will not as simple as he thought it would be. She arrangesfor him to fly to France in order to assess the property's value and to meet with the local notaries.    When he finally arrives at the chateau, he's immediately turned off by it. The greenery is a little too wild and overgrown. The walls of the house itself are caked with years of dirt and dust. The pool is empty, save for a thick layer of mud on the bottom. The disrepair of the estate is undeniable; however, just as undeniable is the underlying beauty that's just waiting to reemerge. It would seem that Henry's long time assistants--the passionate Francis Duflot (Didier Bourdon) and his bubbly yet dedicated wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier)--are the only ones who understand how special both the chateau and vineyard are. They hold a wealth of memories, not just for them, but for Skinner, as well.    Skinner initially plans to visit for one day. But through a series of work- and financially-related events, he's forced to stay a few days longer. Here begins his gradual awakening; he wanders the estate, looking for ways to make it sell faster, all the while uncovering many hidden memories that push him further and further into reacceptance. His mental turmoil is growing, and it gets even worse when he falls head over heals for Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard), a spunky and comically irrational woman who initially finds Skinner irritating (not helped by the fact that he almost ran her over during one of his drives). They play off of each other perfectly; both have experienced things that have made them emotionally distant, a fact that only makes the attraction even stronger.    Everything reaches a crescendo when a young American woman lands on the doorstep. Her name is Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish), and she claims to be Henry's long lost daughter. This puts a serious damper on Skinner's plans; the chateau may in fact belong to her, meaning that Skinner will be unable to sell it. It's immediately obvious that Christie has no real interest in owning a piece of property; she merely wants to learn about her father, if not through an actual meeting, then through his letters, pictures, and memoirs. Her very presence puts Skinner in a position he's clearly uncomfortable in, made even more uncomfortable by his growing fondness for his uncle's estate.    It eventually becomes a matter of choosing; does Skinner want a life of money, or does he want a life, period? Should he sell his childhood home for financial gain, or should he embrace it (as he once did)? \\"This place just doesn't suit my life,\\" he says during one of his more speculative moments. \\"No,\\" replies Fanny. \\"It is your life that doesn't suit this place.\\" Those bits of dialogue may have been simple, but they worked just the same; it effectively reiterates the film's message without getting too poetic. Almost everything else in this film works just as well; I'm recommending it for those who enjoy light-hearted yet important life-affirming stories. \\"A Good Year\\" has just the right mixture of heart and humor, making it virtually impossible to leave the theater feeling unsatisfied.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the Firefly series on DVD after watching Serenity in the theaters. I am completely blown away that the executives at FOX dropped the ball and cancelled Firefly! Did anyone lose his or her job at FOX over this insane blunder? The series is brilliant, smart dialogue, wonderfully original characters, and a brilliant concept. Easily the best Sci-Fi TV series out there. If you are a fan of great story telling you will become a fan of Firefly.
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|While this movie is somewhat predictable, who doesn't love gorgeous faces and hot love affairs? Stone and Baldwin give great performances in their exotic and obsessive affair.

B000BYA4JM|5.0|For those of us who loved the 80's, this a classic 80's comedy! Madonna gives a hilarious performance and outstanding soundtrack. Griffen Dunne plays a straight and narrow attorney who finds himself in a love predicament: he is scheduled to marry his boss' daughter, when a convicted felon (Madonna) interrupts his plans. This movie is a little bit of everything; murder mystery, keystone cops, pimps and thugs, corporate corruption, and of course, a love story. Full of very interesting characters including a wild Patagonian felis concolor (\\"Murray the tiger\\").
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Simply put, Blondie is a legendary band. They are in the Rock-N-Roll Hall of Fame so nuff' said. This CD will give all Blondie fans old and new, best of what this band had to offer musically, sonically, vocally, lyrically. Debbie Harry has an incredible range, and she's got a unique beauty all her own. There is no other Blondie, I can't even think of one female fronted band that <br />even came close to this hybrid soundscape of punk/disco/reggae/rap. <br />Check out all their videos on YouTube, none will dissappoint and I promise <br />you won't be able to take your eyes off Debbie Harry. Viva La Blondie !

B000002GQE|5.0|For some reason, The Moody Blues don't have the place in history they deserve. This is a landmark album, with the band recording with a full orchestra. That may sound common place now, but almost 40 years ago it was unheard of. The song lengths were highly unusual for the time period as well. <br /> <br />Every song is great. What was side two when it was on vinyl is classic. Still waiting for the definitive CD on this one, because the CD's I've heard are very poor.
0375505091|2.0|As a somewhat serious hobbyist photographer, I suspected, when I read the negative \\"family photo album\\" review, that that person was insensitive to such qualities as fine composition that might distinguish these photos.  Leibovitz is a great photographer.  I decided to look at the book before purchasing such an expensive book.  There is, I am afraid, some merit in the negative comments.  Many of the personal life photos do in fact come across as snapshots of no particular distinction.  Obviously these photos have great personal meaning for Leibovitz.  Some of the reviewers seem to be able to emphathize with that meaning.  Perhaps these photos will help some feel better about the quality of their own family snapshots.  I would advise people to examine this book before buying, as I did.  I chose not to invest in it.

B0001GMIOE|5.0|I bought a generic Chinese \\"equivalent\\" bp-511 battery that boasted a higher milliamperage rating and a cheaper price than the original Canon battery that came with my camera.  The battery worked fine for about 3 months and now only holds a charge for about 20 minutes.  I have had it fail at critical times.  Never ever buy some knock-off Chinese battery--read the reviews.  The Chinese push out their crappy knock-offs to unsuspecting consumers (like I was) just to make a quick buck.  Also, don't trust the glowing reviews from the generic sellers.  They are self-generated.  In my case, the seller is no longer selling under his original company name.  He has a new name with the requisite (sham) glowing reviews.  CHINESE PRODUCTS SUCK.

B0000024LN|5.0|Muddy Waters is without a doubt on of the best, slept on albums eva! Not only the best CD da funk doctor has eva put out, but one of the hottest eva in the history of rap. However, it doesn't even get mentioned with the best CD's that came out in 1996. This CD is every bit as good as Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, and other \\"classics\\". I guess i'm being somewhat biased since i am a huge Redman fan, but it is truly an excellent CD and it deserves to checked out by serious rap fans worldwide. Definately better than the garbage out today. As far as the CD itself, Red dropped lots of tight, abstact lyrics and Erick Sermon served it up with some sick beats. My favorite tracks were Da Ill Out, Rolliin, Creepin, What U Lookin 4, Pick It Up, and Whateva Man, but overall the CD is a banger. The Skits were funny and they give the CD a nice balance. The CD is really hip hop in its' purest form. Guests on the CD like Method Man, Keith Murray, K-Solo, Mally G hold their own when they get on, but Redman never gets outshined on any track. The CD will probably never get the credit it deserves, but real hip hop fans know what's up!
B000002GQG|5.0|Terrific follow-up to Days Of Future Passed. It's all here again-the spoken word poems, the concept album; everything but the orchestra. But this is even more accesible than Days because of the shorter, more radio friendly songs. And \\"Ride My See Saw\\" literally rocks! Great album.
0375703861|3.0|I began reading 'White Teeth' in my local library and was swept up instantly by the vibrant, humane and hugely comic opening. Archie Jones's thwarted suicide attempt on the Cricklewood Broadway must rank as one of the funniest openings in novel history. From then on, White Teeth expands in a great number of directions, not all of them successful. On the plus side, Zadie Smith's youthful intelligence, wit, and bubbling insight into multicultural London gives rise to a number of hillarious comic riffs on the nature of family, love, adolescence and identity. The three families that feature in the story - the Iqbals, the Jones' and the Chalfens together encapsulate great swathes of British family life. Her characters are boistrous, funny, and totally humane (no tired, postmodern cynicism here) and the dialogue is, at times, top notch, capturing the educated tones of the middle classes as well as the polyglot jabber atop the number 42 bus. There are a number of great set pieces too, delivered with the aplom of Martin Amis in novels such as 'Money' and 'London Fields'. I found the afro hair salon and the scenes in O'Connells Pool House (neither Irish, nor a pool house) especially memorable. Zadie Smith stamped her mark as a great comic satirist with this novel, and justly so.<br /><br />On the downside, the whole scape came across as rather cartoonish. This is to be excused in such a young writer (Smith acknowledged this, and her writing has indeed matured, witness her Orange Prize winning effort, 'On Beauty'). An Islamic terrorist organisation with the anacroynm KEVIN comes across as goofily funny, with no real depth, and says little about the state of modern Islamism (though to be fair, White Teeth was pre September 11). Characters are Dickensian in the extreme. Everyone has a peculiarity, a funky walk, a verbal tic, a pustule here, a missing set of teeth there. The cast of White Teeth come across like actors in a zany caper film that resemble comic stereotypes rather than fully rounded characters. Ethnicity is a strong theme that is covered with great depth and insight, except in one area. What are the motivations of the white characters (such as music teacher Poppy Burt Jones) who enter the novel, fall in love with a main, Muslim character, then exit stage left as soon as structurally convenient? White Teeth may be the first novel that can be accused of having token white characters, rather than token ethnic ones.<br /><br />In addition, the book strains for intellectual depth that it doesn't quite carry off. Themes of cross cultural influence, the status of the immigrant and genetic modification are hugely expansive, and Smith doesn't capture them with as much style and panoramic vision as one of her great influences, Salman Rushdie, in novels such as 'Midnight's Children', and 'The Satanic Verses'.<br /><br />Still, all minor quibbles, and ones that will be ironed out as Smith develops as a writer. All in all, a hugely entertaining read. Zadie Smith is a powerhouse author who has pulled off the rare and enviable trick of writing novels that accomplish both literary merit and blockbuster sales, and White Teeth will surely last for many years as her memorable fictional debut to kick off the new Millennium.r than fully rounded characters.

B000002GQH|4.0|The band retains the same general formula as the previous two albums (spoken word segments, all songs linked, etc.) But while Days of Future Passed and In Search Of The Lost Chord were groundbreaking, the band comes dangerously close to self-parody here (\\"Face piles of trials with smiles?????) Still, there are enough great moments here to make this highly recommended. Justin Hayward is here in full force (\\"Never Comes The Day\\" and \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably.\\") \\"Dear Diary\\" is one of Ray Thomas' best. The Lodge songs are fine, and Pinder dominates throughout.  <br /> <br />This is probably the last great Moody Blues album, as everything that follows have varying degrees of flaws.
B00005QDW5|4.0|I can't speak to the hardcore Floyd-fans, here.  I mean, I thought I was a devoted follower, but some people here lament the trimming down of songs (specifically the title track) and argue that this disc set is a waste of time and money.  I suppose, if you are a die-hard enthusiast for this group, what you have here isn't altogether new.  And what IS new (namely, the manner in which the songs have been mixed and blended) may, in fact, be a nuisance to you.<br /><br />Speaking as one who loves the group (but isn't IN love with the group), I found this collection to be remarkable.  It is a rare thing for me to feel compelled to simply sit and listen to a CD straight through without doing anything else (ah, we, the generation of the multi-taskers), but this album hooked me as soon as the first song slid gracefully and seamlessly into the second.  They have taken Floyd's typically powerful music, it's sub-sonic lyrical genius, and remastered it into what almost sounds like one long (and moving) song.<br /><br />The operatic quality of this product is in no way heavy-handed or ponderous, and it's amazing to me how the set manages to stir together polar sounds (the puppy-dog-playfulness of See Emily Play wades seamlessly into The Happiest Days of Our Lives, with its satisfying frustrations -- I love it when Floyd gets angry).  This mix and match approach to the band's oeuvre is not disillusioning, nor is it disorienting.  On the contrary, it highlights the brilliance of the music.<br /><br />Like I said, given the tone of the rest of these reviewers, nit pickers might want to step aside -- the songs have undergone some tinkering, and purists might not be pleased.  But for those of you looking for some great, time-tested songs (and even a few surprises) that'll give you a good excuse to sit still for two hours, this is your album.
B000002GQJ|3.0|Though a shade better than To Our Childrens Childrens Children, this album is still a far cry from the glory days of Days Of Future Passed through On The Threshold Of A Dream. <br /> <br />The album starts promising enough, with the brilliant \\"Question,\\" but even that is not as good as the original 45. You can get the original 45 mix on Voices In The Sky. Still another mix on This Is The Moody Blues, is better than the Question Of Balance version, too.  <br /> <br />After \\"Question,\\" things go down hill very fast. This is almost a two star effort, but only my enormous respect for the Moody Blues upgrades it to three stars.

When you watch the movie you would think that these events could not be true, but when you investigate the life of Alvin York, you'll find that the most amazing parts of York's life are actually true.<br /><br />One part of the movie I particularly enjoyed was the scenes back at York's homeplace.  It's an amazing look at the life of rural America during the first years of the 20th century that is not often seen anymore.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|I, being a huge fan of SG-1, owning the first eight seasons (nine coming soon), had no idea what to expect from a spin-off, mainly because SG-1 started deteriorating after the episode \\"Promethius Unbound\\" in which they introduced the stupidest character ever invented. But, back to Atlantis. Totally new characters (except for Weir and McKay), in an amazing new setting, with lots more technology, is a good setup for a great show; which it is. McKay is just as much of a jerk as when his character was invented (the season five episode of SG-1 called \\"48 Hours\\"), and I don't like Dr. Weir that much, but Shepherd is pretty cool and somehow, it all works out. So, where the heck is Season 2?! For some reason the Austrailians get it this November, while those of us in America are getting it \\"sometime in 2007.\\" Oh well.
0739321005|5.0|It took me 10 minutes to appreciate why this won a Grammy for best spoken-word CD (2005).    This book is soulful, moving, intelligent, resonating. Mr. Obama is not only a great writer, but has an amazing ability to be succinct, clear, and touching in his spoken word. Every section is both a poignant story and a definition of his personal values.     While his experiences are of one man in a specific country, culture, and race, its themes are universal.    Visuals are unnecessary. His artful words paint pictures that we listeners can easily and joyfully put into our own minds.    Some highlights:  CD 1 presents his family history with characters that are rich and unique while at the same time very recognizable. Shows how the family influence works in self-development.  CD 4 has a thoughtful essay on the \\"Black\\" Nationalism movement, but it could be applied to any sub-group in society that wishes to be victims and scapegoat others, and there are plenty of those around today.  CD 5 has something you cannot get in the paper version: Mr. Obama sings (and, I might add, quite well). The song simply describes a profound reciprocal relationship between man and God - you don't have to be of any particular religious faith to appreciate its message.     This CD needs to be played in schools and in homes. I can visualize Mr. Obama as a terrific role model for future generations. To that end, I would love to see children's versions of his storytelling produced that could keep them enthralled at least 10 minutes at a time every day. Our future could be enhanced with this.    Also, there should be comparable versions of this CD for other lands that have the types of internal strife that Mr. Obama describes here. Our need for love, moderation, tolerance, and community over corrupt self-interest demands this.    Wherever this man's political futures lie, his current presence in our world is a gift, and we need a world full of Barack Obama's. Please listen to this CD.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Of all the movies I have reviewed on Amazon, I can't believe I have somehow failed to review BBM until today.  Perhaps I'm a little intimidated by this film and a little nervous at summarizing it for the Amazon community.  Nonetheless, here is my tardy entry.<br /><br />Jack and Ennis (two teenage ranch hands) meet by chance and work together in the most rough and unforgiving of environments, tending to and herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming one summer.  To their great surprise (and to the surprise of their boss,) they develop a physical and (eventually) emotional love for each other that neither had experienced before (and neither probably will again.)<br /><br />This film chronicles their attempts to exist in the \\"real world,\\" i.e. the \\"straight\\" world, with each of their wives and children, as they struggle to define and sustain their relationship with each other through the years.<br /><br />If you can't fall in love, just a little, with either Jack or Ennis (or both,) this film won't probably affect you much.  I am struck by how much more I was moved by this film on the big screen.  But on DVD, the whole is still there; you just have to pay attention a little more and thankfully use the volume and rewind buttons (which aren't available in the theater.)  It's a study in love and courage, relationships, expectations, and society.  Love lands where it wants.<br /><br />I cannot remember a film which has inspired so much need in me to visit endless chat sites and the movie site, watch the trailer ceaselessly, buy BBM \\"merchandise\\" on eBay.  Though this is not a happy film, there are moments of overwhelming and intense joy that carry you through the sadness and melancholy and make the journey worthwhile.<br /><br />I would not dare to voice any criticism of this film, but would only comment that the lack of clarity in some of the dialog, particularly Ennis, makes for a frustrating experience at times.  (Thorough discussions of the dialog in question can be found on the Internet.)  Probably the most satisfying explanations are found in one's own heart.  Enjoy.ost satisfying explanations are found in one's own heart.  Enjoy.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I had seen a sneak preview of this film when it first came out and now the DVD with all it's extras make the film even more so... AMAZING. It is the type of Bond film all Bond fans have been waiting for. No more cute, wink wink, laugh out loud unbelievable moments we've all grown tired of. What Casino Royale did was make a very real film, with real life consequences and added a crap load of action. Awesome!!!    Daniel Craig has taken the Bond character and ran away with it. I never saw a more believeable Bond character since the early films of Sean Connery. Ian Flemming's intentions and spirit for the story and character was taken into major consideration and the results were nothing but positive.    Daniel Craig takes the Bond character to his early days before he is granted the infamous double O status. Casino Royale's Bond is an unrefined, reckless, unpolished, aggressive, injury prone, cold blooded killer. In essence, a raw piece of meat, that as the film goes on and he gains more experience becomes this prime piece of sirloin. All the Bond signatures we've all come to love and expect are not a part of Bond's nature, but gradually falls into place at the right moments through his experiences. The journey it took to get there is the most fun to watch.    What makes Bond such a fan favorite in the past was the way the writers and directors romanticized the character. Bond always had the best gadgets (toys), cool clothes, money, he travelled, women galore, he was smooth, he could fight and play a mean game of cards. Who wouldn't want to be him?    Casino Royale took it one step further and said, \\"What kind of man emotionally would it take to be a double O agent and what are the dangers involved in such an exciting career?\\" Casino Royale's Bond is bruised, bloodied, beaten, stabbed, poisoned and tortured in several occasions. He walks around half the film covered in scabs and scars. He is detached from his feelings and makes a clear statement how he prefers marriedwomen because it is less complicated. With no family and friends, he truly is a man alone with nothing to live for, which makes him the perfect candidate for a double O agent.    I have not given away too much of the plot, for it is better for all Bond fans to see Casino Royale and experience it for one's self. It's one of the best Bond film to come out in decades and ranks in my top 2 or 3 of James Bond films of all time.    A quick note... it is important to remember that this story is supposed to be about Bond before he become the James Bond we all know and love. It's his first time being a double O agent. This is why the writers took liberties with the opening gun barrel scene, the vodka martini, the Aston Martin, and the infamous \\"Bond, James Bond\\". I found it a great choice to a very old and established character. We get to see how Bond becomes Bond. Think \\"Batman Begins\\", which was another great film.
1932907009|5.0|I've written seven screenplays, and this book has helped so much with my  last I'm going to apply the techniques with the previous seven.  It's simple to understand, although painful from slapping the forehead so many times with the \\"EUREKA\\"'s that he unveils.  Blake has a great gift for conveying a lot of information in ways that are easy to apply whether you're on your first draft of your first script, or the final draft on your optioned script. <br /> <br />Thanks for the help, and if you don't have this book yet, get it, and throw out any other \\"HOW TO\\" books.  This is the only one you'll need.
B000I5XOVE|4.0|Riggs and Murtaugh chase a drug dealer through the streets and end up finding a cache of illegal South African gold coins that puts them in the cross hairs of a vindictive villain.  Despite being warned off by the bad guys, and later by their superiors because Arjen Rudd has diplomatic immunity, Riggs and Murtaugh stick with the investigation, even taking along the fast-talking, opinionated Leo Getz, a snitch in witness protection they're supposed to be protecting.  As the stakes elevate, Riggs and Murtaugh go incendiary.<br /><br />Mel Gibson and Danny Glover starred in a four-movie franchise that always did well at the box office.  The chemistry between the two is fantastic, and they were the epitome of the buddy cops that elevated the television standard presented by STARSKY AND HUTCH to R movies filled with violence and grown-up language.  Shane Black created the characters in his original script, then went on to write THE LAST BOY SCOUT, THE LONG KISS GOODNIGHT, and KISS KISS, BANG BANG.  Director Richard Donner stayed with the franchise through all four movies.<br /><br />Murtaugh and Riggs cover a lot of the same ground in this film, but although it's familiar, it's also a lot of fun.  The action sequences are big and often, and there's never a dull moment in the film.  The quips and wry asides as well as the visual humor never lets up.  Although the film is now starting to show its age (17 years, and the absence of cell phones is a dead giveaway and the political issues involved are a dead giveaway), LETHAL WEAPON 2 is still a fun ride.<br /><br />Fans of action movies who own the new Blu-ray player will want this disc if they don't already have it on another DVD format.  Unfortunately, there's no added value to sweeten the pot and the disc's special features are practically non-existent.  Still, the picture and the sound are first-rate, so if that's why you're rebuilding your collection of favorite movies, that will be enough.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This project is just what I expected from Josh Groban and I like my expectations met. The quality and clarity of Josh's \\"clear as glass\\" voice rings true all thru out this new project. \\"Lullaby\\" is shear beauty and creativity at it's finest. \\"You are Loved\\" speaks truth and value into my soul--lyrically captivating and musically penetrating....powerful song for those of us who struggle with self-worth. Do have to mention that I was was walking into Barnes and Noble and was greeted by a huge cardboard standee of Josh Groban from the cover his new project(This first time I had seen the cover)...I thot those are some tight jeans brother--is it me or is someone packin' Poncho Via's Donkey in there? <br />

B000I5X81A|5.0|This is a late entry for best CD of the year. No, there are no musical fireworks here. There's not supposed to be. This is Clapton playing and singing with Cale, not the other way around. The result is some great vocals and music. They sound like they have played together for years. This CD gets better with each listen. Superbly crafted and played songs.
B00005ASHM|4.0|But \\"Best Album\\"  - based on what?  Previous postings refers to 'number of sold albums', Beatles, Classical music...  What makes something \\"good\\", or even \\"best\\"? Who gets to decide?  What do we compare it with?  Arguing back and forth is fun perhaps, but we probably need a vote on this.   How many souls inhabit this planet, and how many will vote it best album ever?    I do own a copy of Pet Sounds, sure, but \\"best\\"?   -Nah. Not quite...
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I was waiting long time to have this DVD edition. I first watched the concert on a VHS tape and the difference, especially the sound, is huge. <br />George is at his best musical shape and the emotional mood is evident. <br />I like the whole program, but is undenyable that 'Awaiting on You All', 'Wah-wah', 'Beware of Darkness' 'Bangladesh', the number from Billy Preston and the Dylan's section are highlights. <br />The extra DVD is interesting for giving an extra perspective of what that concert meant in terms of opening people's eyes, minds and hearts about things happening in our world. <br /> <br />P.D. I'm giving it 5 stars, but the image quality... I just think they could have done a better job restoring it.

The ULTIMATE RICHARD SCARRY is the Splish Splash Sounds book. Please and Thank You is really good too. There's some RS author controversy out there -something about the books not all being truly written by the RS author...
B00005CDUE|4.0|Cuts 9 through 18 are spot on if you like the classic Roxy Music period that started it all. Honestly, I find my self skipping through the first 8 cuts, which in my opinion was a weak creative period for RM, reflective of less than inspired lyrics and boring music with hardly any of the hooks of their earlier material.  But still worth the purchase for those last 10 cuts.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|This is amazing!  The talent of making the songs of the album which span different themes into one coherent story is magic!  I was very impressed and also this dvd could easily sell for twice the price amazon had it for.  Nothing short of an amazing buy!
B0000025ZF|5.0|I won't take up your time trying to explain all the various nuances of 'The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking' but in a sense, don't try to think of this album as a mixed-up nightmare but rather a dream of a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis.  Many musicians have written about mid-life crisis before (Pete Townsend's 'Slit Skirts' immediately comes to mind for some strange reason...but I digress). <br /> <br />The story essentially takes the main character through a dream which really turns into an odyssey.  The trip only takes a short period of time (as dreams always seem to do...accomplishing so much in such a short amount of time) which is why I believe Roger Waters uses the dream sequences to pull everything together.  The songs seem disjointed until you realize that dreams really are the same way (disjointed but understandable most of the time).  The crisis the character goes through would be considered normal for a middle-aged man.  Man goes through a marriage, with a job and kids, house in the suburbs, etc..., then starts to wonder if that's all there is. <br /> <br />Then comes the usual things used to replace that middle-aged curiosity...hot cars, fast women and not to be forgotten ... the guilt for even thinking about it.  The character realizes that he is like every other person in the world, someone looking for answers and meaning in life.  He realizes, in the end, that it becomes all about how you live your life.  The answer, arrived at 'The Moment of Clarity', is fleeting (like so many dreams).  For me, the answer is...it's not what value other people bring to your life, but rather what you yourself bring to the table that really matters. <br /> <br />If you keep the themes simple, you will find this album to be a great record of a part of the human condition.  And you'll find this an album to listen to from time to time...finding new understandings along the way. <br />
B000FIMG68|3.0|cause if you do and want to relive the experience, you should have this box. It's not like there are too many extras, but the ones that they have are decent to really good. I mainly got the box cause I don't get to see the show as it airs in the US (I live overseas) and I didn't want to go through the trouble (let alone face the legal consequences) of downloading 18 hours of video off the Internet. <br />If you want to (re-)watch the show, obviously, you need this box. The extras reveal just some secrets not too important to the show. They're still interesting though.
B00005JOSS|1.0|I often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews, 5 stars, are really paid, biased, professionals pumping up the movie for increased DVD sales. <br /> <br />
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Once again, John Mayer proves his amazing talents as vocalist, musician and poet in his latest work, \\"Continuum\\".  As always, his music stirkes a chord in the heart while his lyrics speak of the realities of life as it unfolds.  This album will not disappoint.
B000GFLE86|2.0|I loved '' careless love`` and saw Madeleine live here in Rio de Janeiro in a reasonably good show.I am quite disappointed with this album however because I had great expectations.Let's face it folks, however smoky and billiesque her voice is she is never going to have the power and the range of the original.She needs to be really close miked and well recorded to get that voice to sound right.This is obvious from seeing her live. <br /> So what were those marketing executives thinking by promoting a cd full of soft and slow ballad covers that are obviously going to turn a huge spotlight  on her  vocal delivery? Those songs need an Ella,a Sarah Vaughn,or even a Shirley Horn -to name some  giants- to have a chance of pulling it off with their huge range, timing and phrasing. <br /> To compound the problem , the recording engineers/producers did not do a great job on her voice or the rest of the band for that matter.Everything is much too soft and distant (unlike careless love).If you want an atmospheric but still powerful sound you must produce something like the last Shirley Horn cds. <br /> Last but not least the rest of the good band are not allowed to play anything remotely interesting but are relegated to  very minimalist backing chores. <br /> I think there is a misconception with the record excecs that M.P. has the qualities to make her a modern  pop-jazz diva ala Diana Krall.She has to find her real voice and the correct material to match.Good luck.
B000BR2MD0|5.0|This CD blew me away.  Most of today's new music leaves me cold; I grew up with 50's Rock 'n Roll and pop music has changed a bit since then.  I heard \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" on the radio and it stopped me in my tracks -- a good trick since I was on the freeway at the time!  James Blunt is a MAJOR talent.  Great songs, incredible lyrics.  His songs and voice are full of passion, sorrow, and honesty -- a combination I find irresistable.  James Blunt obviously has a lot to say!<br /><br />\\"You're Beautiful\\" is another winner, a rueful tribute to a love that never was... but might have been.  The CD ends with \\"No Bravery\\", written by Blunt while serving with the British Army in Kosovo.  It has a tragic beauty that brings tears to my eyes.  I love every song on this CD; the three I've mentioned are simply my favorites.<br /><br />If you've never heard of James Blunt (I hadn't!), give \\"Back to Bedlam\\" a listen.  You'll be very glad you did.
1400032717|2.0|The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring.
0780626966|4.0|The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection is definitely a Must Have for any horror fan buff, collector, or just plain fan. The DVD quality was superb and there are a few extra DVDs included. Also, it comes with not one, but two pairs of 3-D glasses! There's a booklet also which sort of commemorates the entire series. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it didn't include Freddy vs Jason. I knew that before I purchased it, though, but I just think it should have. Regardless, 4 stars!
0783226837|4.0|\\"Tremors\\" is a hilarious little piece of B-movie paradise. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are a couple of modern day wild west cowboys, who find themselves thrust into the middle of a giant worm hunt with shapely geologist Finn Carter. Michael Gross and Reba McEntire round out the wacky cast in the battle against the \\"Graboids,\\" giant blind worms which track prey through vibrations.<br /><br />The plot is strictly that of a B-movie thriller, but the director, Ron Underwood, keeps it light with just the right amount of humor to make this an entertaining romp. I won't spoil the conclusion, but I will say that pole vaulting and pogo sticking skills are highly prized before the film is over. (You should be aware that there are multiple sequels, so how good of a solution to the Graboid infestation did the good citizens of Perfection, Nevada actually find?)<br /><br />This is a fun and quirky horror-comedy, which is a cinematic combination that is frequently attempted though rarely mastered as well (and with as low of a budget) as in \\"Tremors.\\"
B000I5X81K|5.0|I loved the diversity of this album. I love Lullaby and Weeping for its African feel. If you prefer more of the classical music that Josh has done in his past two albums, you might not like this album. Way to go Josh and get out of your comfort zone!  <br /> <br />Grobanites should love this new album.
B000J10ERO|3.0|Superman is OK. The SFX are good. The story palatable. An OK afternoon.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Call me a Jane Austen Purist but i hated this movie, I did. I tried to bring myself to like it, but I feel as if the A&E version was more closer to the time, the era, the clothing, the language, the seting, etc. <br />And then the constant childish giggling, this is not the Lizzie I know. <br />The more I watched of the film the more I saw characters being destroyed. For example, Mr. Bennett was just not believable to me and Mr. Colins was poorly cast. I just didn't like this film, even I did think that Mcfayden did a good job in presenting darcy but I don't know, this film just did not do it for me. I feel as if Jane AUsten would be rolling in her grave if she saw this version. I do. I dont know how else to describe my disapointment......
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Listening to these artists over the years I am once again impressed by there dedication to progressive Metal. This album is one of the top 3 I have listened to this year. It is captivating and creative. The slick alterations of tone and rythm changes are awesome. I really enjoy the non-calluos forming vocals again. One to get it my book. Bravo!!!
B000I5X81A|5.0|It is always a great pleasure to hear masters of their craft generating art that is so understated, yet exquisite. With the support of Willie Weeks, Steve Jordan, Taj, and especially Albert Lee, this CD just sails along, carrying the listener to places rarely visited.
0446677450|5.0|if you have not readed this book do so it has a lot of information in it about money and how to save.
0312995423|2.0|First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong. <br /> <br />The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening. <br /> <br />Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from \\"average Joe\\".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't. <br /> <br />So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any.

032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby does not disappoint with this great book.  He explains the digital camera in very easy to understand language.  I've been a big fan of all the kelby books, and this book is no exception.  I've read it a few times cover to cover.  Thanks Scott.
0451203933|5.0|Having seen the movie numerous times and believing it to be the ultimate war/anti-war film, I decided to read the novel on which the movie was based.  I was not disappointed because the novel seems to create a movie in ones brain and you find yourself in the boots of those young men fighting for their lives.  It is a novel about a brotherhood of soliders who when placed in a desperate situation had only each other to rely on.  It also is a story about how a super power that put men on the Moon and circled Mars with a space vehicle, couldn't direct a convoy of vehicles a matter of yards.  A tremendous read and given our situation in Iraq, a very topical story.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I'll make this short since there are more detailed reviews for these DVDs.  But apparently I've been living under a rock since I've recently just discovered Veronica Mars -- one of the best shows on TV that people aren't watching.  I'm a huge Gilmore Girls fans, but I must say that I think Veronica Mars is right up there or even surpasses GG in it's witty, sassy dialogue.  Kristen Bell and Jason Dohring, who play Veronica Mars and Logan Echolls, sizzle onscreen and are such a kick to watch.  The mysteries that they layer on in both seasons are enough to keep you addicted & will have you finishing the DVDs within only a couple days!
0156027321|5.0|The Life of Pi is one of the most intellectually stimulating books that you will find anywhere.  It weaves an amazing story that makes you think about what really matters in life.  It all starts with Piscine Molitor, a boy whose dad owns a zoo.  He has special connections with the animals there and he has interesting points of view about the animal's lives in their exhibits.  One day, his parents decide to move to Canada and Piscine is not happy.  `What is there to do in Canada?', he wonders.  Nonetheless, his parents load up all of the zoo animals that they cannot trade or sell onto a large ship and they set off for Canada.  Along the way, though, the boat encounters serious problems and it sinks.  Piscine makes it off the ship alive and makes it to a lifeboat, but its inhabitants are not the type of company that you want in the middle of the ocean.  They consist of a fully grown Bengal tiger, hyena, zebra, and orangutan.  I think this point is where the story starts to kick into gear.  The action that ensues is intense and very hard to read, but it is brutally honest and life-like.  This may sound a bit cliché, but the details of Piscine's life on the boat made you feel like you were right there with him, experiencing the highs and lows of every day aboard the boat with him.  The story goes on with surprising twists and I think the ending is absolutely fabulous, but I'll leave that for you to decide.  This is probably the greatest book I have ever read and I highly recommend it to anyone.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|Watching this kind of junk science and half truths makes one think of Hitler's so called \\"master race\\". Bending facts and history to push your political views is something Hitler and Gore have in common for sure.  This movie also makes it clear just why Al Gore lost the 2000 election as this film is further proof he is a left wing extremist who plays on slow witted peoples fears. You would have to be confused by punching holes in paper to buy any of this nonsense.  <br /> <br />Case in point Gore talks about how many cubic tons of ice are melting off the edge of one particular glacier. Not only is this purely anecdotal \\"evidence\\" of global warring it has been roundly discredited. Glaciers are always melting as they move south if they did not the Earth would be one giant ball of ice. The real \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" is that the glazieries are GROWING faster then they are melting. <br /> <br />What can you say about someone like AL Gore who see natural cycles of the Earth that have been going on for millions of years and see a threat when at the same time he and his party are protecting the right of terrorists.  <br /> <br />This is junk science and playing on peoples fears. Go ahead and rent it along with your favorite Chicken Little story. It is intended for the same audience except for the fact the children understand child fiction when many adults don't. <br />

If you are a fan of zombies at all, this is part 2 of what many consider the Bible of Zombie (The Zombie Survival Guide being the other half). <br /> <br />There are not words in my vocabulary to describe the awesomeness of this book.  The intricately woven stories make you go back and re-read previous portions to stay on top of everything.  The way everything goes together so well is just pure genius.  And the fact that this is 100% genuine material, not some ha ha funny joke kind of thing. <br /> <br />God, it's so good.  Go read the Zombie Survival Guide as well.
0684803356|4.0|This is one of several Hemingway books I have come to read, actually in this case, listen to.  <br />I loathe idling about so I decided while I wait, wherever that maybe, I would listen to an audiobook. I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long. <br /> <br />I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who doesn't find love  complex ) yet simplistic in it's exposition true to Hemingway's style. <br /> <br />Each character is carefully developed and his/her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions. <br /> <br />Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances....love and war. <br />It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here. <br /> <br />I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas.

B000J10ERO|3.0|I have seen ever Superman incarnation from the beginning in 1948 with Kirk Allen to the present the thing that this movie lacks the most is GUTS. Every Superman before this movie had a fight scene except this one. They made this Superman to politically correct, and less violent. Yes Superman is the good guy but when the guy shot Superman in the eye ball and he just smiles and seemed to do nothing or implied with the smile that he was going to capture the guy with out a fight. That was ridicules. Also when Superman got the crap kicked out of him like the \\"Passion of the Christ\\" that was too much  for me to bear, yes he was under the influence of Kryptonite, but when he wasn't he should have gotten even with the bad guys. He played a victim not a hero and he went to the hospital for the first time in his life lol. You never saw George Reeves or Chris Reeve ever get hurt as bad, even when affected by Kryptonite. If they don't show GUTS and some fight scenes in the next movie to make Superman as powerful as he should be, instead of implying he is so strong he is afraid to hit someone, lol since when did George (SUPERMAN) Reeves pull his punches and avoid a fight when his back was against the wall or in a dangerous situation. THEY MUST give Superman a Backbone in the next movie and make him more like Kirk Allen instead of behaving like a meek Clark Kent with the suit on. Superman is a hero but he needs to act more like Superman then Clark, and all of his fans want to see him punch out the bad guys like he did in all of his previous movies. If he needs a super villain to get into a real fight give him one in his next movie of hang up his cape forever.

B00009NHC5|4.0|Wait until Dark is a unique thriller that takes place mainly in a darkened room.  Audrey Hepburn is moving as a newly blind woman dealing with her handicap.  She is sympathetic in a challenging role that makes real a blind woman's struggle against an unseen danger.  Her performance is believable and the story is riveting.  It takes some skill to make a room come alive in all its darkness and danger.  The climax is satisfying and redeeming as a blind woman uses her other keen senses to outwit her dangerous adversary.  Audrey Hepburn was a skilled actress that never failed to move.  The cinema misses the likes of her and the traditional actress that she never failed to be.  You root for her character and don't question for an instant her handicap or her integrity.  Wait until Dark was an original drama that stands the test of time.

B00005JNS0|4.0|Cars is another Disney Pixar success. It succeeds in warming the heart; it makes you appreciate the value of friends and family; and it continues the tradition of teaching good morals. It's a class-A family film.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />There has been a tremendous proliferation of computer generated films over the past couple of years which has certainly diluted the excitement that used to surround these movies. 2006 has got to set the record with 13...count 'em...13 releases that I can think of (Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, Hoodwinked, The Ant Bully, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away).<br /><br />And perhaps that is why I was a bit tentative going into Cars. Or perhaps it was because I just didn't think a movie about car racing and cars-come-to-life could be as enjoyable as the Disney Pixar films that preceded Cars. I should have known better.<br /><br />Cars is another in Disney Pixar's unblemished track record of delivering the epitome of a wonderful family classic.<br /><br />Here's a little trivia: John Ratzenburger appears (rather, his voice does) in all (Toy Story [1995], A Bug's Life [1998], Toy Story 2 [1999], Monsters, Inc [2001], Finding Nemo [2003], The Incredibles [2004] & Cars [2006]) of the Disney Pixar releases to date, and there's a little tribute to this at the end of Cars during the rolling credits.<br /><br />Cars is a very good movie that's well worth the purchase.

B000002UA7|5.0|This is an amazing work from a tremendously talented lady. Kate Bush always sings with a level of emotion rarely found in modern music. Her lyrics always have something interesting to say. The new vocals version of Wuthering Heights (track one) is awesome. Really not a bad track on the whole disk. A must have for anyone who appreciates Kate.
1577314808|5.0|This is THE book I recommend and give to people as an introduction to spiritual life.   <br />It is just beautiful and powerful.  It is sad some people criticize it and \\"don't get it\\".  Anyone who has ever experience being and the witness state can feel that the writer has some real attainment.   <br />This book is to be experienced to see the deep wisdom and power it has to offer.
B000077VR3|4.0|Although the subjects and material broached in this highly unusual musical have been glossed over many times in various different forms of the media, there is something electrifying about Moulin Rouge.  At times it does feel like a long music video, but then we should remember that music videos are, like all versions of film, an art form--granted they are a terribly abused art, but they are art nonetheless.  The fact that a musical and a music video should mesh is not a ridiculous notion, nor is it without its uses. <br />I am no big fan of Ewan McGregor or Nicole Kidman, but I have to give them their dues--they did some amazing vocal work, and some great acting.  It doesn't take an infatuated and sappily loyal McGregor fan to see that there is real talent here, and it is actual instead of potential.  And even if the romantic aspect of the musical doesn't interest you, it is possible to shift your attention to the conflicts of the individual characters. <br />There has been criticism about this being a period piece, but if you get hung up on the little details and completely forget that, as many movies do, the story and (in this case) the characters take precedence over perfect history narration, then this isn't the movie for you.  Even if the film was historically correct, we can't rightly say that it is accurate to history that people randomly burst into song, can we? <br />As for the music of Moulin Rouge, well, what can I say?  There are some awesome songs, taking old material and bringing to it a new spin with either an interesting melody, or unusual vocals. <br />Another aspect of the musical that has been critiqued, and rather too harshly, is the cutting/editing.  During the entire movie and the songs especially, the shots change constantly and sometimes switch between many different scenes and characters many times in a few seconds... Again, Moulin Rouge is a musical, an art form in its own right, and instead of simply relying on the material in front of thecamera to emphasize the situation, the cutting and pacing of the film is sped up and very erratic, lending energy to the musical.  I think this is rather effective, especially in the scene where Nicole Kidman's character is about to sell herself to the Duke.  The cutting allows the audience to see all the characters (albeit for very short moments at a time) reacting most every moment, with brilliant use of color to draw out emotion, and lighting to leave shadows of danger and mystery. <br />This musical is, overall, not the most unique in its material or plot of love and love lost, but certainly is in its direction and artistic approach.  The music, at times incredibly interesting and pretty or fun to listen to, is at the least entertaining.  Brava to the actors and actresses, main and supporting, for doing what they are supposed to be doing--acting.  If you want something less conventional, and riveting from the beginning, I recommend Moulin Rouge.

0060254920|5.0|Wow what a great book to read to the two - five year old set that they can look back on at an older age with fond memories.  Cute story but the illustrations are what will keep kids looking through the book for years to come.  Sendak does a great job of creating \\"wild things\\" that are somehow a little bit monster like yet cuddly and loveable.  And of course our Max knows the magic trick of how to become king of them all. So let the wild rumpus start.  You'll still be home in time for a hot supper!
B000JLTR8G|5.0|Finally! They are releasing this movie on DVD!! Great movie showing the differences between the East and the West (mechanically, philosophically, and culturally). And the sword play is spectacular! One of my all time favorite films!!!
B0002GTWQA|4.0|How thin the line between cowardice and honor? I think this DVD does a very good job of examining that question. A story of personal failure and the measure this one man was willing give to be able to feel his life had meaning and to find redemtion. What is your honor worth? I enjoy this movie each time I see it because it makes me ask some very tough questions.
B00005JPB4|5.0|This may be the most outstanding movie dealing with war since The Best year's of Our Lives. I compare it to that because they are both about men experiencing war and confronting coming home. I sit here two days after seeing Flags of Our Fathers and it still resonates within me. It isn't a conventional story arc like Saving Private Ryan and it has a higher bar to clear to convincingly express deeper, more complex themes. Some of the more cynical critics only see it as a rehash of the simple theme that war is hell. Undoubtably, this is one of the themes since Iwo Jima was as hellish as they come. But Eastwood succeeds in much more than that. Never have I seen a more compelling style bringing the viewer to grips with something they can never truly understand without being there. No one is patronized, canonized, or stereotyped, only humanized without sentimentality or simplification. Eastwood is a mature master, and possibly the only current director capable of authentically examining the human soul. I haven't seen any other movie this year on this level. Too bad they probably won't give him back to back Best Director and Best Picture awards, but he deserves it. Best Adapted Screenplay and Cinematography should also go to this picture. Most of all, Adam Beach should get Best Actor for his portrayal of Ira Hayes. If you don't read the book before seeing it, I recommend you at least google the story James Bradley told at the Iwo Jima Memorial to some tourists. It's a nice preface about the men in the immortal photo of Joe Rosenthal.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This is great family movie!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it!
B00005JNRY|5.0|First, this movie is great. End of Story. My husband and I watch MANY children movie and cartoons with our 3 y/o - by force AND by choice. We started our Disney collection 10 years before we decided to have children!   <br /> <br />Some are really really lame (Doogal), some will be loved forever (too many to list) some are worshiped as classics (Shrek, Hoodwinked).  I would say we are pretty good judges of cartoon styles and presentation... <br /> <br />Cars is up on the loved list.  I will not get tired of this movie....EVER!  Especially appreciate the silence at the Rust Eze after party when someone shouts \\"FREEBIRD\\".....  I snorted in the theatre. <br /> <br />But one thing tripping me up is that I remember the twins (Tia and Mia - who are the fans who follow McQueen and then Chick, and I recall them lifting their wheel wells as if to \\"flash\\" them...) and in my WalMart purchased DVD I do not find this scene.  Anyone else miss this?  What else did they take out and was it Pixar or WalMart who made these edits. <br /> <br />Do tell me all your secrets of the trade!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Whedon does it again! This series combined sci-fi with an old west slant. The characters and storyline developed quickly, but left you wanting more. I'm sorry there was only one season.
B00005JO9J|3.0|Grey's Anatomy milks every tired cliche ever invented by the soap opera genre.  Expect to be entertained - but never surprised.  What have we got? A former model turned surgeon who must prove her worth, a star intern who falls for the brain surgeon (who used to ride a motorcycle and listens to The Clash), the aggressively ambitious Asian American woman, the frat boy with a sensitive soul (who falls for the ex-model), sleeping with your boss and getting pregnant, etc.  You name it, Grey's Anatomy's got it.  Sometimes, it feels like an insult to your intelligence, especially when Meredith's does voiceovers: \\"Adulthood means responsibility... and responsibility sucks.\\"  No kidding.
1400049628|5.0|Brook's \\"The Zombie Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Living Dead\\" is by far one of the funnier books I've read this year. This book covers just about everything I could possibly think of that's relevant to zombies, including: an overview of the symptoms of an infection; the multiple stages of a Zombie invasion; and the kinds of weapons that work best against this undead horror. <br /> <br />I have always been a big fan of horror, especially humorous horror, that made some attempt at being \\"serious,\\" at dealing with its subject in as realistic a fashion as one could. Brook's does this. In fact, the constant seriousness and intensity with which he discusses surviving a Zombie invasion of any size is the most amusing part of the entire work.  <br /> <br />I've also found this book to be an excellent source for ideas, especially regarding the RPG campaigns I run that involve zombies. Were I to ever (for some random reason) create a zombie movie, or write a zombie novel, I would definitely turn to this book as a way to infuse a bit of reality into my story.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I cannot believe that I have been waiting and looking for these DVDs to come out for the last 6 years - ever since the final airing in May 00 with the Donna David Wedding...I have posted and looked everywhere for them and found out that the MAIN REASON these have not been released prior to now is that the studios could NOT get the release for the original music that was on the aired shows.  Some contractual thing, so perhaps since Mr. Spelling's death, that gave the studios the right to change the music (I could truly care less anyways, I have all the CDs for the shows if I really wanted to listen to the music).  I tried to find VHS in Canada and in Europe and then got ripped off in one scam for a full set of tape in 2000. <br />Anyways, both 90210 and MP are and always will be my favorite shows.  Watching the first episode brings me back to a time where I cannot believe we wore those clothes.  I am about 3 years older than the gang in the show but still, I loved it. <br />FX played the reruns (I love the later seasons with Valerie) for a few years and I loved that. <br />Anyways, I am glad they are finally here and I can't wait to drop a lot of hard earned money of the remainder of the seasons.  I know there were 10 for 90210 but not sure about MP.  Thats a lot of $$$

B000BFH2S2|5.0|Anyone who listens to this artist and gives him less than 5 stars must be tone deaf!  Frank Sinatra would be proud to know that someone as talented as Michael Buble' is carrying on his music to the next generation of the world.  The younger generation of today (myself included) thought Sinatra was for our grandparents, but Buble' has proved us wrong.  He always gets my feet tapping and my fingers snapping!  Can't wait for his next album and tour.  Until then, he'll continue to be the most played on my iPod.
B0002JJBZY|4.0|Star Trek was a ground-breaking series, but a few of the episodes (especially early in Season 1 before the main characters come into their own) are pretty painful to watch. 4 stars overall for the 3 seasons, but many of the episodes are 5-star. No doubt you have seen the show on TV (edited to fit in more commercials), and other reviewers on Amazon have written excellent reviews for the single season editions so I won't go into details.  I just want to summarize some information that may be helpful in deciding whether to buy this set now, or wait until later...    First, the set I received had several defective disks (1,6,7 in the first season). The program freezes, then eventually skips from seconds to minutes of the show.   Amazon has a good exchange policy, and I'm hoping I get a good set this time, but I won't know until I go through all the disks and that will take a while.  At least one other reviewer has also recently (fall 2006) received defective disks, so it is likely that there is a bad batch at Amazon at this time.      - UPDATE:  I received the replacement set and have watched all the episodes. It has defects too, but I'm keeping this one as they are relatively short, and only affect two episodes of the three seasons.    Second, as many people have noted in the single-season reviews, this has to be the most impractical packaging yet devised by man.  The outer plastic cases don't stand upright on their own.  They come with what looks like a sales display stand, and will stand upright in these, but I notice the individual stands have been reinforced and weighted in the bottom by what looks like leftover building material.  Inside each case is a stack of plastic trays held together by cellophane tape.  This fits inside a thin paper sleeve which will no doubt tear soon, and the accompanying paper booklet does not fit in the sleeve.  So you have to go though several levels to get to the disks, and the booklet falls out each time.    Third, as others have hinted, Paramount has been remastering all the episodes with new CGI for the ships, and for some other effects. It's the same ship, it just looks real now instead of like a model on a string.  The sound is also being remastered (and in a few cases the music is being re-recorded).  The picture is also being cleaned up.  These episodes are currently airing on affiliate stations as they are completed (also edited to fit in more commercials).  You can go to the Paramount website and navigate through their 'home video' page links/search/etc until you find the Star Trek pages.  There you can download previews and information.  I've seen a couple of these remastered episodes airing locally, and TOS has never looked so good.  Be aware that as of this writing, Paramount has not committed to releasing the re-mastered series on DVD, but I have no doubt that they will as they have a history of getting as much money from Trek fans as possible.      - UPDATE: The revised episodes are being released in dual format (High Def DVD and Standard DVD) beginning with Season 1 in November of 2007 -  [[ASIN:B000VDDDY6 Star Trek The Original Series - The Complete First Season (Combo HD DVD and Standard DVD) [HD DVD]]]. As of this writing, Amazon's price for the first season is nearly as high as this set of all three seasons. If you are patient, no doubt the price will eventually come down, as this is Paramount's pattern.       The bottom line...if you want the series with all the original effects (cloth backdrops, the same planet tinted different colors, reused ship clips, etc) go for this set.  I doubt if it will get any less expensive than it is at the time of this review.  But download some of the remastered previews from the Paramount site first, and if you can, watch the remastered episodes on TV before making up your mind. They aren't altering anything that significantly changes the show, and it looks stunning compared to this set.  If you want the remastered 'improved' version though, you will have to wait until Paramount releases it (season by season, and eventually the full set), and expect to pay a lot more than this set, unless you are willing to wait a year or more after release.  Finally, if you decide to order this set, check all the disks as soon as possible, as it appears there are defective sets being sold.  Hope this helps in the decision...live long and prosper :-)
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins demonstrates that religion is an atavistic superstition. His argument would be stronger if he'd given more attention to the vastness of the universe. Earth is one of nine planets circling a medium-sized star in a medium-sized galaxy, which holds billions of stars, and which is only one of billions of (known) galaxies. That a 'Creator' created all that so as to judge human beings -- after they'd evolved from 'lower' life forms -- is patently absurd. <br /> <br />As is the idea of 'heaven.' Christians, Muslims, and others imagine an afterlife (an oxymoron) in which 'souls' are exquisitely happy. Presumably not one of those souls is inferior in any way to all the others. That means they all know everything every other soul knows. What that means is that, by their own creed, there is no individual or consciousness. In other words, no individual survival -- no 'life after death.' <br /> <br />Dawkins has launched an assault on the superstitions that continue to rend humanity -- from Northern Ireland to Iraq to Sri Lanka -- but that will, alas, continue to give fanatics (from George Bush to the mullahs) an excuse to continue slaughtering people who do not believe as they believe. Perhaps in another thousand years....
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Every talented, original, innovative band that achieves success over a number of years inevitably reaches the point where a significant part of its fan base accuses the band of \\"selling out.\\"  This usually occurs when one or more of the following happens:    -the band receives major label backing  -the band gets a new producer and/or access to state-of the art production facilities  -the band members make a great leap forward in terms of musicianship and/or songwriting  -the band achieves commercial success and/or critical acclaim     For Death Cab for Cutie, all of the above occurred with \\"Plans.\\"  Studio gloss has sanded off Death Cab's rough edges, their songs have become tighter and more ambitious, and they have achieved nearly household name status.  So naturally, their diehard fans who stuck with them through the lo-fi indie years have accused them of selling out.    While some call it \\"selling out,\\" I call it \\"getting better.\\"  I have heard, and quite like, Death Cab's earlier work, particularly \\"We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes\\" and \\"Transatlanticism.\\"  \\"Plans\\" does for Death Cab what \\"OK Computer\\" did for Radiohead: it marks their great leap from rock's best-kept secret to a band that's finally achieving the success they deserve through hard work and persistent innovation.    I began listening to \\"Plans\\" at the same time I was studying Baroque music at Rutgers.  I was quite astonished at how classically constructed Death Cab's songs are.  I won't elevate Ben Gibbard and company to Bach's level just yet, but many of their songs - particularly \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" and \\"What Sarah Said\\" - exhibit the \\"motoric rhythm\\" found in Bach's concertos.  These songs drive forward with active bass lines, articulate drumming and intertwining keyboard and guitar ostinatos.  Also found in Death Cab's work are terraced dynamics - changes in volume level caused by instruments entering and exiting.  A harmonic nod to early music is suggested by \\"Someday You WillBe Loved,\\" with shifting dominant chord relationships found in Renaissance and Baroque dance music.  I don't know if Death Cab for Cutie studied music history, but they have clearly evolved from songwriters into composers, and the result is extremely satisfying on a visceral level.    \\"Plans\\" is quite possibly the best rock album of 2005, and I believe its reputation will only grow with time.  Death Cab diehards, don't begrudge the band's well-deserved success.  Embrace it, and satisfy yourself with the knowledge that you recognized their greatness before the masses did.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have been a fan of Josh's for a couple years now. I took my girlfriend to see his concert and I became converted. I had my thoughts about him, and the genre (i'm not a huge fan of il divo) and was very skeptical about this guy. I eagerly awaited his new album and it was well worth the wait. In fact, I was absolutely blown away. Like his style or not, the guys voice is out of this world (the one star reviews on here are just stupid)...besides that I really like how he decided not to settle in to what I always thought of as kind of a sameness in classical crossover or whatever you call it. He's using his voice AND his creative mind to make something that I haven't ever heard before. It doesn't play by the rules and I think that probably ticks some people off but every song on here is a gem. My favorites are So She Dances (my girlfriend also loves this one), February song, and Machine. I also really like the song he wrote with Dave Matthews. I want to have kids one day and I can imagine that one being a staple in my family. Thanks for the great music, Groban...keep it coming and keep trusting your instincts.
6305971099|4.0|This was a one of the great horror movies of the eighties.  Unfortunately it was the last great Halloween movie made until H2O.  It contained the hallmark frightening trademarks including the eerie Halloween music.  The opening was great and it made a decent conclusion to its predecessor Halloween 4.  <br /> <br /> However, there are a few notes of concern (which is why I rated this movie a four).  The biggest problem of all, was the end didn't really end.  I know this is common in many horror movies but this ending really really sucked.  It was almost like they were trying to give Michael Meyers a killing buddy.  Something  like a chopping and dicing duo.  Although for those who have seen the sequels following this one, you realize they really never ever explained the mysterious man or why he was ever even in the movie.  He just blows up the police station and frees Michael Meyers.   If you are going to bring in some off the wall.....(insert appropriate metaphor here), then at least bring it to conclusion in one of your sequels.   <br /> <br />If you are a true horror fan then by all means purchase this for your library.  But prepared for the mindless slicing and dicing that is the trademark of many mass murderer horror movies.    <br />
B00006GFAB|4.0|I am not the biggest fan of Kiss, yet they are still an important milestone of rock and roll, and even though they had mostly simple songs, they still paved the way for glam rock, buy being one of the first to do the \\"Full Makeup\\" act. I however, do think that they had some killer songs over the many years that they have been performing, and most of those songs are here. I am sure that Kiss Maniacs aren't satisfied with this album, since they ommited a lot of great songs from the Debut album and Destroyer which are easily their best albums. They also didnt do the best job on handling the material from the 80's era, as it seems they just kinda of threw on some songs from the era, without really putting on their \\"True\\" best from the 80's. Missing is the great ballad, \\"Tears are Falling\\" and some great songs off thier best album of the 80's \\"Hot in the Shade\\" OVERALL, its still got great songs on it, even if they left off some tracks that should have been added, instead of adding the dreadful \\"Got to Choose\\", \\"I want you\\", and \\"God Gave rock and Roll to you II\\" and \\"I was Made for Loving you\\" (the low points of this album) I would have added \\"10,000 Years\\", \\"Black Diamond\\", \\"Tears are Falling\\", \\"Plaster Caster\\" and \\"I'm Alive\\" and thats coming from a causal Kiss fan. Its still alot of fun, and a great place to start. From there, add Kiss \\"Self Titled\\" \\"Destroyer\\" \\"Lick it up\\" and \\"Hot in the Shade\\" and you will have a solid Kiss collection.
B00005JNS0|4.0|The producers of CARS will probably have to dust off their shelves to make room for the Oscar it will probably get for Best Animated movie.  CARS certainly has dazzling animation and its basic selfish guy gets a heart premise will probably find its way into the hearts of the families that watch it.  Is it really all that different?  Other than the fact that the characters are CARS, it's really just a rehash of films like ICE AGE, OVER THE HEDGE, ETC. ETC.  But one can't deny it's entertainment value.  Randy Newman's delightful song OUR TOWN will probably garner him another nomination, and the voicing is really fun.  Owen Wilson is speedster Lightning McQueen, the hero whose self-importance takes a bruising when he finds himself in the small almost deserted town of Radiator Springs.  There he meets a Porsche lawyer voiced by Bonnie Hunt; a towtruck named Mater which is Larry the Cable Guy; and a former racing hero named Hudson Hornet played by Paul Newman.<br /><br />There are some cute moments and the animation IS brilliant, so CARS is a fun film to enjoy.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Although this is actually the second CD offered by My Chemical Romance many believe it to be their first. The first CD \\"I Brought You My Bullets You Brought Me Your Love\\" was released on a small label and therefore not as well known. \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" is an outstanding CD. The first time you listen to it you will understand why this group is so loved by their fans. Simply put the songs ROCK. Tunes like \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\" stick in your head refusing to leave. The song \\"Helena\\" written for the late grandmother of Gerard and Mikey Way is hauntingly beautiful. \\"Ghost of You\\" offers the same deep emotion. Gerard Way has a voice that can scream obscenities at you one moment then caress you the next. The mix of hard pumping rock and deep felt emotional tunes is perfect. Also listen for Bert McCracken of \\"The Used\\" on the tune \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\" Even the artwork on this CD is special. It was done by Gerard Way a very talented artist. This is truly an excellent CD.
1594481717|2.0|First let me state that the terms \\"technotrash pseudo-fiction\\" are not intended to be negative in the sense that this book is trash to be ignored or thrown away. What is significant here is the genre of technotrash pseudo-fiction. See the other reviews to get a feel for what I am talking about. The book reads like a story, which it is. It offers up that comfort food satisfaction for the mind that many crave--just like pulp fiction! So, if you are looking for any sort of depth or a cut-to-the-chase analysis, this book is a waste of time--in fact, just browse the book here at Amazon and read the reviews. I use the descriptor pseudo-fiction because the book is not fiction, it is just layman science served up that way.<br /><br />Two stars for being well-written, two stars for lack of depth and far too much fluff.
B00004UFTU|4.0|\\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" is Marillion's first proper album, originally released in 1983. It's an interesting listen, inspired by the sounds and evocative lyrics of classic progressive rock and covering a variety of topics close to the heart of the band.    Marillion sounds a little like early 1970s Genesis, though the production is a little more 1980s, and so are a couple of the keyboard tones. Lead singer Fish sounds like an angrier, more melancholy Peter Gabriel as well, which is interesting. The feel of the music is very different from Genesis though, particularly on this album. The atmosphere of the record is more like an album by The Smiths, and the lyrics, though theatrical and melodramatic at times, are more socially conscious, like in \\"Forgotten Sons\\", a song about the tensions of Northern Ireland. Fish is a unique lyricist, he bends metaphors in a very interesting way, and it makes for some curious imagery against his descriptions of the life around him, whether it be in the unrequited love in \\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" or in his descriptions of a snobby \\"Garden Party\\". Though it isn't a concept album, there are a few lyrical themes that run through the record, (the idea of life being like a play, sons and fathers, etc) which are interesting to think about.    The one problem I have with this album is the 8 minute track \\"The Web\\". The music's all right, but there is this very, very, very high pitched synthesizers weaving in and out for atmosphere, and it's kind of painful to listen to on headphones, even though its not that loud a sound. It's just something about the frequencies it runs through. Spoils the song for me a bit.    The CD booklet of this remaster, though a little thin, contains lyrics for each of the songs and an introduction by Mark Wilkinson (the artist behind the cover art), describing how he came up with the cover, and how the sheet music on the jester's table went on to be a hit for Kajagoogoo. I don't know whether he was being serious or not about that, though.    There's a two disc version of this CD floating around, which contains a few B-sides and stuff on the second disc, including \\"Market Square Heroes\\" and Marillion's 20 minute epic \\"Grendel\\" (based on the Beowulf sequel of the same name by John Gardner). I'm kind of wishing I'd gotten that release now, but it's all right. I got a very good deal on the one disc edition, and those B-sides are available elsewhere, (on the \\"B-Sides Themselves\\" compilation, for instance).    There's great music on this CD, but for a newcomer to Marillion, I'd go for their third album \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" instead. It's a concept album, it's a little more acessible and it has Marillion's biggest hit \\"Kayleigh\\".
B00003CXPJ|1.0|This is a good film if you are brain dead or comatose.  I have never given any movie a one star until now.  But this had no redeeming quality that is worth mentioning.  It lacked anything resembling decent acting.  It was like the actors/actresses were trying to intentionally bomb, and they succeeded.  The plotline was written on par with a picture book for a two year old.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for a good movie then pass on this.    <br />
0679745203|5.0|I must confess that I expected a novel more along the lines of the movie, which is -by the way- one of the most beautiful movies of all times. To my surprise, the book barely resembles the movie in its pace, its stories, its dramatism, and made me not only love the movie even more, as to stand in awe before Anthony Minghella's ability as scriptwriter, because he managed to be faithful to the spirit of the novel and, nevertheless, write an altogether different story.  <br /> <br />Contrary to what you might think (as I thought when I bought the book), this novel is not a tale of that love story personified by Kristin Scott-Thomas and Ralph Fiennes, although love and deception are present in the lives of everyone there.  WARNING: if you loved the drama, the rapturous passages of love between Katherine & Almásy, and the beauty of the photography in that movie, but are not attracted to either poetry, nor long, detailed, beautiful descriptions of the desert, or how Kip becomes a sapper, well, you'd better stick to the movie, because this book definitely is not for you.   <br /> <br />But if you can get past all that chapter, and have some flair for a not-so-fast-paced style of storytelling, you'll be greatly rewarded; beautifully written and poetically descriptive, the stories of Hana, Caravaggio, Kip & Almásy are carved into the big fresco of the WW II and its last days in Italy; the atmosphere of this novel is not as intense & passionate as the movie's, probably for its lack of a plot. Instead, four stories are told, each of them a world on its own, broken lives each with their own dose of love & betrayals, and only touched between them by the circumstance of the war.  After I read it, I could only recommend its reading to those who look after beauty, despite everything else.

0743289412|5.0|SK takes us to much deeper depths than ever before.  This is not your typical SK horrorfest.  It IS a love story.  It rips us from our fascination of love among the 20-something crowd, to the understanding of fully matured love among the AARP generation.  Without a doubt, this is his best work to date.  For those who are struggling to wade through the confusion of the first of the book, remember one thing...it's a bool...a blood bool.

0743454537|4.0|The emotions and events of this book seemed mostly believable.  I found myself sobbing on more than one occasion.  Terminal illness and loss are given realistic but hopeful treatment.  I identified with many of the characters and at the end wanted to send it to my brother because of a special loss we have shared.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I recently completed watching the entire season of Supernatural. I did not know what to really expect, but in the end I ended up enjoying the show very much. At first it was a bit hard to get in to the show, but by the third or fourth episode I was hooked. The chemistry between the two brothers Dean and Sam is what makes this show so great. Dean has this cockiness and a funny charm that always lightens up the show, while Sam has this innocence all of which bring the show down to earth. At times I found myself jumping at the scary parts which is very rarely do with a TV series. The show has some scary episodes and has the feel of a movie to it which makes it that much more enjoyable. I highly recommend this great show to anyone who enjoys tales of urban legends or great old fashioned American folklore.

B000F3T7RE|5.0|This re-issue at bargain price of the Emerson's complete Shostakovich quartet cycle is a reminder that their breakthrough readings are roughly a decade old now (the set was taped in concert from Aspen 1994-99). Instead of Russian soul we get clean, often faster interpretations that brought out Shostakovich's modernist side, aided by the ultra virtuosity of the playing. In the meantime, however, other groups like the St. Lawrence and Hagen Quartets have made even more severe, biting, stark, haunted, and tragic recordings of selected works from the fifteen quartets. This doesn't mean the Emersons have been eclipsed, only that they started a trend that shows no sign of ending.<br /><br />Also, I'd like to point out that if you want the best all-around modern set from a Russian group. the Shostakovich Quartet, which recorded for Olympia, can now be found on bargain reissues from Regis (Berkshire Record Outlet offers the complete quartets for $20). The SQ play beautifully, are well recorded, and imbue Shostakovich's music with more emotional intensity than the cooler Emersons. By comparison, the old standby set from the Fitzwilliam Quartet on Decca seems dated and stodgy. The choice for me comes down to 1. Emerson complete cycle 2. Shostakovich Quartet complete cycle or 3. Pick and choose among outstanding individual readings from the St. Lawrence, Kronos, Hagen, and of course older Soviet groups like the Borodin and Beethoven Quartets. That's just a thumbnail sketch. Many die-hard fans won't give up their beloved Emerson cycle, while older aficinados would never part with their traditional Soviet favorites.<br /><br />P.S. 2013 - I regret that I skated over the great Shostakovich quartet cycle made in the sixties by the old Borodin Qt. before they changed personnel - it's available on Chandos at a good price and contains unmissable performances of the then-existing quartets (excluding no. 14 and 15).
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I have to say that I was floored by this new Josh Groban CD...FLOORED !! I have the previous two, and the growth displayed in this new one is hard to measure. The courage it must have take for him to leave the familiar and comfortable world of the 'safe' and venture into S.A. music (Weeping), the world of funk and groove (the Herbie Hancock offering), the etherial and haunting Now or Never with Imogen Heap (!!!) and his own February Song, it's hard to fathom. And beyond the wonderful orchestrations and interesting melodic twists, he also revisits one of his strongest suits, interpreting romantic and often sad ballads in Spanis and Italian. The future is so bright for this artist I can't imagine where he'll be in 10 years, but I hope it's Broadway, but only after he conquers the world. Nobody I've ever followed as a musician works as hard as this man does to bring this unique style and open emotional 'converstation' with his listening public (and he has a huge one already). Bravo Mr. Groban and don't change a thing, you're on the right track, your OWN track and I cannot wait to see where it takes you, and us your avid listening public.  <br /> <br />The DVD is wonderful, the 'making of' Awake goes into the studio with Josh and the producers and the photoshoot/video shoot footage is hilarious, the guy is so relaxed and so naturally funny, it's very entertaining. <br />Favorites? February Song, L'ultima Notte, Lullaby/Weeping, Machine and definitely Now or Never with a bullet !
B00004R7TP|5.0|I can easily say this is the best Kate disc ever offered to the public. Each song running perfectly in unison, taking the listener a long walk through a forest. At first, it all feels fun and carefree until the trail leads to insomnia and then the waking of the witch. For me, this cd is so powerful because though it is filled with pop hooks, Kate allows for new and inventive way to present them. Each song is a gem. A truly remarkable feat.
0895260131|4.0|*** <br />I would give this book three stars. Originally I did not want to read this book now that I finished reading it I feel much more educated about Islam as a religion.    J.T. <br />  <br />*****  My Review:  The book was written from the point of view of a non-follower of Islam. The author builds what appears to be a logical argument for Islamist desire to kill me or at least subjugate me. It would be interesting to do some follow on reading of the Koran, books that Islamists don't want me to read, and perhaps a couple of books by Islamists who make the argument that Islam is a peaceful religion (if there are any). I'm glad I read it and I recommend it for a deeper perspective into Islamic thought.   W.P. <br />  <br /> <br />****     <br />I would rate it a 4.  I'm not an avid reader although I enjoy reading once I get into a book.  I think a lot of people don't understand the Muslim people & especially their religion.  Even looking back at the Crusades & how that evolved along with the Muslim religion was a very important part of history.  Of course, it is very necessary that you learn about your enemy; however, it is barbaric for them to kill anyone who doesn't follow their faith & hope they can conquer the world all in the name of Allah.   I will have to finish reading the book in order to get a complete assessment but the author reveals the truths that many of us don't want to face.   E.S. <br /> <br />**** <br />I came into this book critically mindful of the slant that it unabashedly titles itself - believing that it's goal is meant to shock.  I believe there are some leaps of logic.  The author didn't clearly define what was authoritative for the religion and so some of the proofs given left me wondering, for example next to the Quran how authoritative are the Hadith? When the author says that the speaker is one of authority in Islam, how far reaching and broadly accepted is that?  However, with the Quran in hand I was astonished to see that the verses were not taken out of context and so I found them the most convincing evidence for what I would consider his two main theses: that Islam's intention or mission statement for the world is conversion, dhimmitude (subjugation) or death.  Secondly, that moderate and liberal Islam either rejects or does not know the Quran.  However the author does not make a clear and sound case for the connection of jihad to violence.

B000B7HZXM|5.0|Growing up with Classical Rock and having enjoyed rock music by Rod Stewart, I didn't think I'd like this CD. One evening I was having dinner at a friend's home and they had this one playing. It was beautiful. Being a little older now (in my early 40's), I enjoy more mellow music than the head banging variety that is heard now. This CD of Rod's was nostalgic, romantic and extremely easy to listen to.
B000H30B2C|2.0|OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.<br /><br />The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?<br /><br />Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics.

B00008S2VG|5.0|Ahhh, defending Madonna.<br /><br />I love this album. I think it is a momentous occasion when our country's state of affairs evokes such an album from a pop star!<br /><br />Having said that, this album is a more courageous move than any skin Madonna may have exposed over the years. (I CERTAINLY ENJOYED EVERY MADONNA ANTIC. . .AND YOU KNOW THAT YOU DID AS WELL!) Madonna is the undisputed master of pop, but that does not undermine the social/personal/emotional relevance of this amazing album. I have owned many of her records since virtual infancy, and this one (over the past couple of years) has become my favorite, hands down.<br /><br />\\"X-Static Process\\" has been such a helpful song for me, personally. The acoustic, tender structure of the song is superb, and the content of the lyrics are even better! In relationships, we are all tempted to lose sight of our value as an individual, from time to time. This song is a gorgeous reminder to never lose sight of your worth, no matter how much you may love another person - you are just as good. WONDERFUL song, in every way.<br /><br />\\"Love Profusion\\" is an admittance of all-encompassing humility (\\"I have lost my illusions\\") and repressed romantic rage (\\"I've got you under my skin\\") quakes beneath. The result? - It's a love volcano!<br /><br />Die Another Day is more socially relevant than politically. It inspires me to keep driving each day. It is a brutal, get-off-of-your-a**-and-keep-striving song! The world needs more of them!<br /><br />Buy it love it. Vote.
B000AP04MO|5.0|This is one the best love stories of the 1960s.The script,direction,and  <br />performances are all perfect.Frederic Raphael's sharp,intelligent,witty <br />script contains much humor and delivers some stinging barbs at marriage. <br />Stanley Donen's brisk,inventive direction results in one of his best films.Henry Mancini's score is tuneful and charming.The supporting cast is excellent(William Daniels is hilarious!).Albert Finney is marvelous <br />as the gruff but loving husband.But the movie belongs to its radiant leading lady.Audrey Hepburn is tough,sexy,and absolutely irresistible here.In fact,she was rarely so perfectly cast.Somehow,Donen seems to bring <br />out the best in her(This was their third film together).She and Finney are at their peak here.This film is an absolute delight from start to finish.Sit back and enjoy!

0618680004|5.0|I can't articulate the importance of this book.  It is truly for all readers. Whether you are the pillar of faith or a hardcore atheist, this book is a cornerstone.<br /><br />Dawkins lays out a concise well researched argument against religion of all types.  He attacks the religion from new and old angles with a lucidity seldom matched. Everything from the causes of religion, effects on society and the alternative explanations are within this text. The argument laid out is sure to enlighten more than a few readers but one thing is certain: If you are of the faith THIS is the book you will have to steel yourself against in the future. There isn't an atheist in the world that won't quote from this stabbing piece of work.

068484267X|5.0|This book has become my all-time favorite book, which is saying something since I avoided it for years and years fearing it would be too depressing.  Depressing it certainly is, but Mr. McCourt knows how to tell a story in a way that draws you in and shuts everything else around you out until you are lost inside the pages.  I literally could not put this book down and the minute I finished it I turned it over and read it again...then ran right out and bought and read 'Tis! <br /> <br />Mr. McCourt's candidness and wry humor about the years of hopelessness and despair captured my heart in a way no other book has ever done.

I figured out the entire film in about 5 minutes and for someone who likes suspense in a film, I can't say this interested me much. It's your average superhero film where the bad guy is obvious from the start and you know he's going to fall for the best friend who has feelings for him but only after he has the relationship with the pretty villain. & ugh... I'm sorry to tear down a family film but nobody over the age of 12 will have a good time. so save your money, there are better kids films.

630025111X|5.0|It is a sad thing nowadays to see the genre of the Western, the most uniquely American film genre there is, now all but a distant memory in Hollywood.  The scenes of wide open spaces, the rough life of the people who inhabited it and tried to make a new start for themselves in such unknown territory--things like these give us a sense of our history and of good storytelling, the kind of which is so often in short supply in 21st century Hollywood, where big money is at stake. <br /> <br />Take for instance the underrated 1970 western MONTE WALSH.  Based on the book of the same name by Jack Schaefer (the writer of the novel \\"Shane\\" that became one of the greatest western movies of all times) and set on the dusty Arizona plains of the late 1890s, this melancholic but well-crafted film stars Lee Marvin in the title role of an old cowhand who, along with his good friend Chet (Jack Palance), now feels the heavy hand of age upon him, and also sees those signs of Eastern \\"progress\\"--railroads; telegraphs, etc.--closing in and slowly but surely rendering those of his type obsolete.  But Marvin is not one to kowtow to the kind of progress represented by faceless individuals from the East, especially not when Palance is gunned down.  He also doesn't find it proper for him to sell himself to a Wild West show, no matter how good the money; as he tells the show's emcee: \\"I ain't spittin' on my whole life.\\" <br /> <br />MONTE WALSH marked the directing debut of noted cinematographer William A. Fraker, who had already attained wide acclaim for his camera work on BULLITT and ROSEMARY'S BABY in 1968.  Here, aided by fellow cinematographer David M. Walsh, Fraker frames the film much like a Remington painting, earning him possible comparisons to the classic style of John Ford.  Clearly, however, MONTE WALSH belongs to that crop of westerns that were to emerge in the wake of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, where the taming of the West is not so much celebrated as it is questioned.  Although obviously less violent than Leone's or Peckinpah's films, it is every bit as deeply moving and exquisite as those directors' films are, with Marvin and Palance each giving some of their best performances, and the fine location shooting in southern Arizona adding to the ambience. <br /> <br />Though it has been on VHS for a while (and was remade a few years ago, with Tom Selleck doing Marvin's role), it is high time that this fine sagebrush story also find a home on DVD as well, and in a restored condition.  Films like MONTE WALSH, and indeed all Westerns in general, will be lost to history unless this happens.

B00005JLD4|5.0|For 25 years, through 1940, A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) served as the Australian government minister in charge of Aborigine affairs. This movie portrays the true story of several of his victims.<br /><br />The government authorities rounded by Aborigines and forced them to live in allotted areas, where they controlled every aspect of their daily lives, right down to how many pairs of shoes each individual could receive. The worst lot fell upon the mixed children of Aborigine mothers, whom this movie implies were often (if not always) raped by white men.<br /><br />In 1931, Molly Craig (Everlyn Sampi), then 14, her sister Daisy Kadibill (Tianna Sansbury), 8, and their 10-year-old cousin Gracie Fields (Laura Monaghan) visited the Jigalong trading post with the girls' mother Maud (Ningali Lawford) and their grandmother (Myarn Lawford) and found themselves hunted down like rabbits by the government's police, whom Neville had authorized to kidnap them to be raised at Moore River, a \\"school\\" camp to \\"civilize\\" Aborigine \\"half-castes.\\"<br /><br />The school was in fact a sort of prison; frequent escapees were tracked and quickly returned. And even their tracker, Moodoo (David Gulpilil) was effectively imprisoned there. Not only was his daughter also a victim of the government policy, but he was refused frequent requests to return to his home. Much like the children of Native Americans, kidnapped and confined to similar \\"English only\\" schools until well into the 1960s, these girls were mistreated badly, and had their hair cut off for daring to speak Aborigine--or, heaven forefend--escape.<br /><br />Before the girls' capture, Molly had often seen the \\"rabbit proof fence,\\" constructed from north to south across Australia to keep western rabbits out of the pastures and ranch lands. Her mother had also shown  her the \\"spirit birds\\" (whistling kites), which she'd said would always watch over Molly.<br /><br />And so it is that, after being transported in cages, by truck and train, some 1,200 miles from home--and  a very brief separation from their family--the girls follow Molly's lead and set out to return home. The film mostly tells of their nine week journey across harsh outback and desert--to the background music of whistling kites and Australia's haunting Aboriginal didgeridoo, the lengthy, 1- to 2-meter low-toned wind instrument.<br /><br />Adapted from the book of Molly's daughter--the award-winning author, Doris Pilkington--the film very effectively personalizes the plight suffered by many Aborigine parents and children from 1905 through 1971. Molly Craig died in January 2004, at the age of 87.<br /><br />Unfortunately, several governments still separate children of \\"unwanted\\" minorities from their parents, to this day. These aren't the \\"Western colonial\\" governments that viewers might expect; They include Hungary and Romania, who target Rom children and families, as well as African and Asian governments, who persecute other minorities.<br /><br />Moreover, historically, separating minority children from their families and raising them differently was and remains a time honored practice within the institution of [[ASIN:1591026024 Islamic jihad]].<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

B000H30B2C|1.0|The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end.

B00005JPC7|5.0|Any movie that can evoke both laughs and tears wins, in my estimation.  Stranger Than Fiction achieved both.  The tears were short lived, but present.  And the laughs?  Well, they persisted throughout.<br /><br />The plot is delightfully original and refreshing.  Will Ferrell, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, Queen Latifah, and Maggie Gyllenhaal all delivered wonderful performances.  The soundtrack is catchy.  All in all, definitely worth seeing.
B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|Okay, first of all, I know you're all going, \\"Ugh... MCR, that emo pinup crap...\\"<br /><br />So, now that you've gotten all that superficial moaning and groaning out of your system, listen.<br /><br />I didn't think that Gerard Way and co. could do \\"epic,\\" but they've actually somehow pulled it off with this album. I was looking for more of the same that I'd heard on Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear that MCR has really filled out their sound.<br /><br />The Black Parade is also a concept album, much in the style of Reprise labelmate Green Day's American Idiot. It follows the protagonist through their death, and then past that too, in MCR's macabre fashion.<br /><br />Their usual high energy returns on many songs on the album, such as the latter half of the grandiose \\"Welcome to the Black Parade,\\" their premier single from the disc, as well as \\"This is How I Disappear\\" and \\"Dead!\\" However, their breadth of style has expanded as exemplified by the odd and quirky track \\"Mama,\\" featuring guest vocals from Liza Minelli, of all people. There's also a hidden track, \\"Blood,\\" with strangely vaudeville-style vocals from Way, whose vocal talents have been honed quite nicely with this album. You'll still get the soul-shredding shrieks from him in places on the record, just as you'd come to know from Three Cheers..., but accompanying it are expressive, playful vocal turns and mocking tones, and sometimes wistful and sorrowful expressions of regret.<br /><br />There are smatterings of the influence of The Beatles and even more so, Queen, all over this album, as well as dirty smudges of prog rock thrown in at various points.<br /><br />Overall, yes, this is My Chemical Romance. But this is a bigger, better, more poignant My Chemical Romance than you might be used to. In my opinion, The Black Parade is definitely worth checking out, even if you cocked a disapproving eyebrow at the band previously.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|This is riveting story telling that doesn't talk down to its audience.  Critics seem to be tired of films that interweave three or four narrative threads.  But that's often how real life works.  Our stories are rarely told in isolation, and, ala the butterfly effect, our best-intended gestures (such as making the gift of a rifle to a guide in Morocco) can have unintended consequences.  But none of that really matters when you have stories as engrossing as the four collected here.  The connections are sometimes obvious, as in the case of Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett); they have just lost a child and are in Morocco trying to put their marriage back together.  They have left their surviving children, a boy and a girl, in the care of their nanny, whose son is getting married in Mexico.  When Richard tells the nanny she can't have the day off, she makes the life-altering decision to drive across the border with both her young charges and her firecracker nephew (played by Gael Garcia Bernal, an alumnus of director Alejandro Inarritu's earlier masterpiece, \\"Amores Perros\\").  The story that initiates the action is that of two young Moroccan brothers, who receive a rifle from their father, with the instruction to kill the jackals that are attacking their goats.  When the younger brother takes a pot shot at a passing tour bus, Susan (Blanchett) is shot and the complex plot is set in motion.  The most tangential, yet in some ways the most provocative, thread is provided by the Japanese story, which centers on a deaf-mute young woman (played by charismatic newcomer Rinko Kikuchi), whose mother has committed suicide.  Although she lives in a culture that panders to youth, she is both physically and emotionally set off from the adults in that world--including her father--who might give her solace.  When she acts out sexually with a kindly, if somewhat disconcerted, policeman, she finally inspires a response from her distant father, the same Japanese tourist who once gave a rifle to his guide in Morocco, who then sold it to a goatherder with two sons.  This approach to film making can come off as forced (think \\"Crash\\"), but when it works (think the best films of Robert Altman), it can provide a singularly satisfying viewing experience, the sort of thing that both challenges and provokes audiences, and that keeps them coming back to the cinema.  Indeed, Inarritu is such a masterful film-maker that I wouldn't be surprised to find him on the short list for an Academy Award for directing in April.nce gave a rifle to his guide in Morocco, who then sold it to a goatherder with two sons.

0783240287|5.0|Movie was great-saw live performance in Dallas with Jon Secada playing lead. I think his voice is better than Donny's but Donny sounded good, too.A great family movie, especially if there are any music lovers or budding singers watching <br />
0743298020|5.0|Awesome book.  Classic gothic crumbly old ruin/family secrets/dubious intentions/shady past ghost story.  A woman who works in her father's rare books store has a few novels/biographies to her name.  She spends her life going unnoticed trying to unravel the secrets of her own past when one of the most magnificent authors of the times requests HER to write the biography.  It is a fabulous read, perfect for one who is always picking apart the mystery in the novel, swimming with half-truths and guesses, formulating your own ends and finales.  I never even guessed this one.  Been a long time since that's happened.  Just read it.
B000I5X81K|5.0|This album was SO worth the wait - every track lovingly constructed. This man is a genius.You will not be disappointed if you purchase this. <br />He deserves EVERY award going! <br />
0553804677|5.0|I picked up this book off the library's new book shelf. I had not heard the hype or any publicity about it. I love it! I was sorry when it ended and now I find it's a trilogy! For once, I'm thrilled. I want more. It was inventive, colorful, and twisty. I was surprised to find it was the author's first book. I look forward to more of Scott Lynch as well as Locke Lamora. I thought it might make an interesting movie. I am not sure what Hollywood will do with it, I hope it does not dissapoint the fans if it ever gets made.
B000784WMW|5.0|I've seen 2 other versions of this movie and this is my favorite. The producers stick pretty faithfully to the book.Timothy Dalton is a great actor but since Jane tells Mr.Rochester that he is not a handsome man I Timothy is a bit too handsome for the part! It's a great rainy day movie for any classic book lover
0740748475|5.0|This was a splurge purchase for us and the best hundred bucks or thereabouts we've spent in a long time.  The intro is fascinating and the comics, reproduced full size, rather than the shrunken newspaper versions, are brilliant.  We have no problems getting our son up in the mornings as he relishes the prospect of reading Calvin & Hobbes once he is ready for school.  He can't wait for it to snow so that we can fill the yard with Snow Goons.  Go on - go mad and treat yourself.
B000000H66|5.0|Very good album, the songs are perfects, Chuck was the best. I really miss him.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Amazing. Impossible to describe, you really must watch it. If you've ever seen 'What the Bleep Do We Know?' or have ever sat some while thinking about life and what it entails, then get this movie! GET IT.  <br /> <br />I'm so stunned by what is discussed by it that I listen to the movie without watching it sometimes.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I absolutely love this entire album. February Song, written by Groban, is beautiful. In Her Eyes and So She Dances are fast becoming favorites as well. I was excited to hear Machine as it show Josh has eclectic taste in music. He does a great with Machine.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I read a review written by someone who was rating Stevie Nick's \\"The other side of the mirror\\" and at that time the person wrote that she would never produce another album that was as good or as popular as \\"Bella Donna\\".   That had to be before she produced \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\".   I can't speak for record sales but I think that artistically this has to be one of her best albums.   Every song on this album is great and as good as Bella Donna was, This has to rate as one of her most fantastic albums.  I actually like the \\"Wild Heart\\" better than \\"Bella Donna\\", but if you are a true fan of Stevie Nick's this album should amaze you.  Go out and buy it now.
0887307280|5.0|I read E-Myth cover to cover.  It's a quick read.  I found this book full of exciting and useful ideas.  Especially useful for a small business operator, but the principles apply to a large business also.  I have a lot of experience in business myself, and still learned something new.  I think the more experience you have, the more you might benefit from the book, because you will see the truth of the ideas presented.  Too many of us function like technicians in our businesses and don't grow to be managers or entrepreneurs.  The use of \\"E\\" was adopted by the author before the Internet era, this book is not an Internet book, but about basic principles of how a business should be run.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I have had this album on repeat for the last three days. It is everything...gorgeous, unique, and to me, sounds crazy smart. The orchestrations and background music is as wonderful as Josh's voice (which has matured and sounds probably the best I've ever heard it!) Props to Josh for being an excellent songwriter on top of everything else. It has a lot of the same style ballads from the previous two albums for those who are crazy about it, and some new funkier, more outgoing music as well. I adore it, so get it. The DVD is cute too.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Like a lot of people I first got into Dire Straits through Brothers In Arms in the mid 80's. Then quickly got all of there other albums, including Communique and they became my favourite band. Communique is the album that I still play continuously to date and includes my all time favourite DS song News. It is quite different to their later more commercial releases, but I think thats why it is so good, just a 4 piece rock band, with a legendary Guitarist Frontman, who wrote some of his best songs for this particulary album.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Just like many people who have reviewed this album, I have been a fan of Josh Groban's since the beginning.  The thing I most admire about Josh's voice is that even if the song is not your favorite, or maybe you cannnot fathom why he picked, or someone picked for him to sing this song, his voice draws you in.  His voice always brings life to the music, it always gives the song a deeper meaning.  He is young, but at the same time it seems he personally connects with all the songs he sings, it doesn't sound disconnected or distant, he sings them as if he is experiencing, or has experienced the emotions that are central to the song.  I love all the songs on this CD, there is not one that I don't like. I enjoy all of them for different reasons, and feel that Josh has really expanded his vision on this album and I am proud of him and very glad that he chose the songs he did, they are wonderful.  If you enjoy Josh's voice and are open to different types of music, and are not expecting a repeat of his self-titled debut album or Closer than you will be pleasantly surprised I definitely was!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|As a die hard Hip Hop fan this was the first John Mayer album I listened to.  This is a wonderful album, almost magical.  I wish I could have been in the studio when this was put together.  This won't be my last Mayer album...I can call myself a fan now.
B000I5X81K|5.0|i'm speachless. this album really takes you away. wonderful production, great orchestration. and Groban's voice...MADE IN HEAVEN.  <br />
0142001104|5.0|The best book for personal development I have ever read.  <br /> <br />Just by reading this book, you will improve your life. Just letg Mr. and Ms. Zander's passion flow from the book into your mind, and transform your life.
0694003611|5.0|An absolute MUST for any family's reading list! GREAT introduction to the world of reading, stories, and picture book art. Simple, easy to read, easy pictures.
0399230033|5.0|This is a classic. My little girl loves this book. We have been reading it for two years now. She is two and half years old.  She laughs at the monkey stealing the keys, and loves when the wife wakes up and finds all the animals in bed with her.  Fun book.
074322454X|4.0|I came to this book after having already seen the excellent miniseries and read Larry Alexander's wonderful bio of Major Winters, and while the story was still great, the presentation just didn't measure up to what I'd been expecting.  All of the great dramatic tension, emotional intensity, and character development in the miniseries and the other biography just weren't there for me.  It is a quick easy read, and it is a fascinating true story of a truly unique and heroic company, with just as many interesting things happening outside of the battlefield as on it, but a lot of passages seemed kind of like a highschool term paper, relating facts, figures, and direct quotes, yet not going much deeper, filling in the narrative between the lines, making it a more personal account of history.  This is probably the first time I've preferred the movie to the book.  For example, I'd been hoping for even more detailed accounts of certain scenes in the miniseries, or for even more information on some of the soldiers who didn't get a lot of screen time, and that just wasn't there.  Things that were so much more detailed and emotional in the miniseries were often just glossed over in the abovementioned \\"just the facts\\" style, or even left out entirely.  And I agree that some passages did seem to have rather different styles, uncomfortably calling to mind the plagiarism charges that have been leveled against Mr. Ambrose.<br /><br />I also was a bit bothered by his frequent personal opinions and judgments, which seemed really unprofessional in a work of non-fiction.  It's not objective history when you're injecting your own personal beliefs into what should be a balanced narrative account, particularly when you're dealing with such a complex subject as war, and with a period in history that already has so many equally valid perspectives because of how many sides and units were involved.  It's one thing to have gotten very close to the material and to justly point out all of the amazing things this company did, but entirely another to seemingly cheerlead for them alone, without giving credit to other just as heroic companies who also helped in winning the war and taking back strategic areas.  There also should have been some sort of a glossary; not all readers are going to be familiar with all of these military abbreviations and terminology that Mr. Ambrose keeps casually dropping without definitions or explanations.<br /><br />I did like how we got to know more of the men in the company than the miniseries allowed, such as Sgt. Earl Hale, who got medical permission to not wear a necktie after getting his throat slit by a German, Cpl. Walter Gordon, who was paralysed but eventually was able to walk again, and Sgt. Wayne \\"Skinny\\" Sisk, who first dealt with his horrific war memories by drinking but later was inspired, through the words of his 4 year old niece, to pray for forgiveness and ended up becoming ordained.  However, given that there were so many men in the company, and not all of them can figure onto every single page, it can be a bit hard to keep track of or remember who's whom.  I also began to feel rather annoyed by how often Pvt. David Webster was quoted, and at such length.  I'm certainly not discounting his bravery in the service, nor how much the company really meant to him, but I didn't get the impression that he ever really did anything so noteworthy that merits his being constantly quoted on practically every single subject.  He was a private for the entire war, never volunteered for anything, had a rather cynical attitude toward what he was doing, seemed to be involved in the war so he could write down his observations for a book instead of for more practical reasons, and was wounded and in the hospital from October of '44 till mid-January of '45, which meant he missed out on some important battles and events, particularly the ordeal at Bastogne.  So how again did he merit monopolising so much of this book, while more interesting and involved fellows like George Luz, Leo Boyle, and Earl McClung weren't really covered in that much detail?<br /><br />Overall, this was a good book, and it did fill in some of the missing pieces I'd wondered about.  The shortcomings in the writing style and some of the more dubious historical claims can be overlooked to a point because the meat of the story, the story of this amazing company and what they went through together, this bond forged in fire, is the compelling thing driving the narration forward.  I just wish it had gone into more detail, gone deeper, and carried the same emotional intensity that the miniseries did, really making the reader/viewer feel that s/he personally got to know these men and went through these intense experiences right along with them, instead of just reading a more or less purely descriptive account that one would expect from a term paper, not a professional piece of historical non-fiction.teresting and involved fellows like George Luz, Leo Boyle, and Earl McClung weren't really covered in that much detail? <br /> <br />Overall, this was a good book, and it did fill in some of the missing pieces I'd wondered about.

B000FL7CAK|4.0|With her friend's murder solved, Veronica tries to regain a sense of normalcy in her life. This season revolves around the people of Neptune as the town becomes more polarized. Its a bit lighter and funnier than the first season, but the show is still willing to tackle issues other shows in the genre would be afraid to explore.  <br /> <br />Unlike last season, this season Veronica is less of an outcast. Romance plays more of a central theme in this season and Veronica struggles to be more of an typical girl, with mixed results of course! There are several new characters in the cast (I didnt like all of them, honestly) and the B mystery revolves more around Weevil and Logan than Veronica. This one is a bit more convoluted than the previous season, but the power of the DVD allows you to follow it in order without the pesky commercials. Not quite as gripping as the first season, but still an entertaining and intriguing mystery... with another superb, nail-biter finale!
0767816641|5.0|We have nearly every Disney movie ever made but our  <br />3 1/2 year-old daughter loves this movie more than any other right now.  It is one of those \\"happy\\" movies that are easy to watch over and over.  It contains none of the off-color/adult-humor undertones that many kids movies like Cat-in-the-hat and Shrek have and which I find objectionable for tots.  Highly recommend for both girls and boys.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is not your typical teen drama. It's much more gritty and dark than you would expect. The first season revolves around our main character Veronica, who has been through hell and back, and is trying to solve the mystery of her best friend's murder. In this season, Veronica is the ultimate underdog and the most unpopular girl in school. Veronica is an intriguing protagonist, especially in the first season.  She's angry, vengeful, sad, lonely, and extremely clever. You really feel for the character as you follow the season.  <br /> <br />The main stories mesh well between the season long murder arc, but you have to watch the season in order at first. There are plenty of surprisingly twists and turns that will have you at the edge of your seat and few 'filler episodes.' The ending of this season is very gripping and shocking as the murderer is revealed. Highly reccomended!
B000FP2OPY|1.0|well i bought this series and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is brillantly written, the acting is 1st class,and the actors of a standard that rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do  mean they score higher than ten. i can understand its  five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium, numbers,waking the dead,it out shines them all.If i could i would rate it 10 stars.if there is a secound series i will  be buying it.
B000B8QF00|4.0|I like most of her music but the song LET'S DO IT blew me away when I first heard/saw it in the Cole Porter movie a year or so ago. I truly wish she would do an entire CD of old standards like that or a CD of Cole Porter songs.
B0007OCG56|4.0|A lot of good directors will tell you good stories can often fall apart if the casting is bad. There are particular actors and actresses that are not terrible in their respective films but they feel woefully out of place among the talent around them (Katie Holmes in Batman Begins, Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection or Denise Richards in the World is Not Enough). In this case, it's Adam Sandler who actually doesn't even feel miscast. He does a very respectable job at getting away from his Happy Gilmore/Billy Madison schtick but this time instead of being miscast, he just seems like a lightning rod for miscasting rants from people. <br /> <br />The film actually centers around Flor and Cristina, a Spanish mother and daughter respectively who move to California. Flor ends up taking a job as a housekeeper at a really nice house. Only thing is she can't speak any English whatsoever so that causes some initial problems. Things still continue when both of them move in and Cristina finds herself being at a huge center of attention from the wife Deborah. Deborah is shifts moods radically while her husband John is an unhappy restaurant chef, even when he gets a 4 star review. The film mainly centers around different styles of parenting and dysfunction that can happen in families. <br /> <br />Now I should get this out of the way: Sandler doesn't feel miscast, in fact he's quite good, despite some Sandler-esque bits (his dialogue during a rather strange love scene is very reminiscent of his other stuff) but I think his presence suggests this is going to be a low-brow humor geared to frat boys. The real stars are Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, the headstrong but slightly stubborn mother and the wise beyond her years daughter respectively. In fact Bruce steals the show where she not only has to translate a fight with John and Flor but she nails the shifting emotional states of both characters. Tea Leoni I always felt gets really bad reps with stating she's a terrible actress (although her performance in Jurassic Park III made me wish a dinosaur did snack on her) but here I loved her.  <br /> <br />The film's main problem is its running time. Ever watch a movie that felt long or was long but looking back on it you couldn't figure out where you'd take the scissors if you had the chance? Spanglish to me is similar in that at 2 hours and 10 minutes it does seem a bit long yet I couldn't tell you what scenes required additional editing since they're important in and of themselves. Not to mention it's not exactly the most cliche-free plot as there's some scenes that are going to be obvious and when they happen they don't really surprise (a possible romance between John and Flor, Deborah and her mother having an all-out or jealousy among Flor and Deborah) but the film's entertaining anyway. <br /> <br />Should you watch the movie? Personally I say so. It's rare lately to watch a good comedy movie that never felt as if all you'd get out of it was laughs.
6305949980|5.0|This is one of the top movies in my all time favorites list and for good reason.  It came out two years before I even reached age 10 but I remember seeing and it being fascinated in a chilled sense.  The Nightmare Before Christmas is a humorous (and somewhat dark) take on the classic Christmas tale--eventually becoming a classic itself.  The first movie to be made in stop motion features memorable characters, brilliant music and great talent.  Parents concerned if The Nightmare Before Christmas is too dark for some of their children should put those feelings to rest; it's a movie and an entertaining one at that.  Like most adventure-influenced children's movies this has its good characters and scary ones.  But it's still fun and shouldn't freak one's kids out at all.  Overall The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of those films that is both fun and brilliant.  It's classic!
B0002NRQTS|4.0|This is not my favorite Rush album but is still a great production. <br />Probably Presto has one of the highest sound qualities that I have ever found in a rock album. This was made in a transition period in the late 80's. If you like rush this is an essential CD.
B00000F169|4.0|This is one of those movies in which the INTENT is far greater than the EXECUTION.   <br />If you read the novelization of this movie, by Alan Dean Foster, it reads as great sci fi, about depressed men who are slowly going crazy and beginning to hate each other on a lonely mission in space.  The ending is amazingly touching, but then again, it should be since it was 'borrowed' completely from a great Ray Bradbury short story called Kaleidoscope.   <br /> <br />You'll love this move ONLY if you can overlook poor production values and see the brilliant and witty story underneath.  Great production values don't actually help with comedy, just look at the recent Hitchikers Guide movie, which was disatrously blah, in spite of glossy effects. <br /> <br />Personally, I'd LOVE to see someone remake Dark Star and do it right! <br />cb
B000002GF8|5.0|This is the most elegantly work done by the police. <br />It was their last and best work. It shows the musical maturity reached by Sting, Summers and Copeland. This CD is a must.  <br />This is one of great albums in rock & roll history.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I think Lost is the best drama show out right now.  I love all the characters and I think the acting is superb.  I recommend anyone who loves drama/suspense type movies and shows that haven't yet watched Lost to get on board and start! You won't be disappointed.
B00005JPC4|2.0|It's tough being a Russell Crowe fan. I've been one for a over a decade now, and boy have we had our ups and downs. \\"A Good Year\\" will be remembered as a midpoint; not a pinnacle, but not a barrel bottom either. Which way will he go from here?<br /><br />Based on the Peter Mayle novel, the film chronicles the very contrived adventures of a ruthless business man as the magic of Provence turns him into a cuddly teddybear. That's pretty much it.<br /><br />He meets an alluring french girl (Marion Cotillard), argues with locals, has a conflict with his newly- discovered cousin (icky undertones), and finds his soul. What originality squeezed from that plot would have to be in fresh performances, and they just aren't there. Here's the rundown:<br /><br />The Good: Eh, not much. Truly spectacular cinematography. Misty vineyards and Monet-palate hillsides. Performance wise, only Archie Panjabi as Max's street smart, oddly loyal assistant stands out.<br /><br />The Ok: Russell himself. He's just not that into it. There are moments when we see him, the Russell Crowe of \\"Rough Magic\\" and all else pre-\\"Gladiator\\", and there's a bit of the old electricity. But the rest of the time he just goes through the motions. The Crowe of ten years ago might have made something special of this. Albert Finney, as Max's irascible old uncle, is Albert Finney. Everybody else is just sort of there, taking up space and being forgettable.<br /><br />The Bad: A sub par script that fights pace-wise with Ridley Scott's edgy style. It just doesn't gel. We never really care all that much what happens to any of the characters, or the lovely chateau at the center of the conflict. And the chemistry between Marion Cotillard and Russell is nonexistent. Not even a spark.<br /><br />In conclusion, skip this one, at least until the DVD. It's hard to covey in words how not worth your time the film is. It's unpleasant where it should be sweet, dull where it should be deep, and off-putting where it should be sexy. The cast, I'm sure, had a great time drinking and dining in France, but we don't get to taste the food or the wine, so it's no party for us. Skip it.<br /><br />Grade: C-it should be sexy.

B000H305U0|4.0|As a massive fan of bands such as The Flaming Lips (well actually, wanye Coyne likes JT, as he has played gutiar with the lips on british show Top Of The Pops) and Pink Floyd And Marilyn Manson, you would not think that it were possible for this reviver to have anything but negative things to say about MR. Timberlake, well be prepaired for a shock.  <br /> <br /> <br />Justin \\"Trouser Snake\\" Timberlake has released a very solid sophomore release whit the album. This time Justin want to show the world that he is the new prince, and its not a bad impression of the purple one, at all.  <br /> <br />The production on this album is second to none, thanks to producer of the moment Timbaland, who works his magic on this album with slickly produced funky as hell beats. Tracks like \\"SexyBack\\" \\"Sexy Ladies/Let Me Talk To You Prelude\\" and \\"My Love\\" are three of the funkiest tracks that have been released this year. <br /> <br /> <br />This is a great little slice of pop that proves just because something has been designed for the commercial market doesn't automatically mean that it is going to complete soulless muck, if those of you out their who think that popular music means it automatically rubbished opened your mind, you might actually enjoy this album as its very good and well worth a listen, this is an album form a artist that is only going to get stronger with each album, just don't leave 4 years before you relase the follow up to this one up.  <br />
B000002JAX|3.0|I want to like Madeleine Peyroux. I've heard some of her live radio performances that really touched me. On the album cuts I've heard so far, she seems a little restrained by comparison, a bit less spontaneous.  <br /> <br />She sounds like Billie Holiday, I guess. I am not a Holiday fan, so frankly I could care less. It is a non-issue. Madeleine is not trying to ape Holiday, I am convinced. That is just the way she naturally sings. <br /> <br />The problem I find with this album is that it is uneven. Getting Some Fun Out Of Life, which is an obvious example of her Billie Holiday sound-alike-ness, is a fetching little song. And La Vie En Rose is beautiful. Some of the arrangements on the other tracks are so corny, they're like something you'd hear coming from the public bandshell at the Iowa State Fair.  <br /> <br />All I can say is that this was her first record. I didn't even care for the first Beatles album that much. So she's grown a lot in ten years. Today her song choices are better and her arrangements more refined. There are some gems here but choose wisely. Maybe download selected tracks you want. I know I'm glad I did not buy this. At its best, it is a promise of better things to come. At worst, it is a little embarrassing.
0784011176|5.0|Hi <br />Nice and interesting drama , but the best part is Holly Hunter naked, long scene, a rare appearance for this actress. <br />So if you are her fan or just a collector like me this movie is for you. <br /> <br />Regards <br /> <br />Avi
B00005JPAJ|5.0|MOVIE: Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu has established himself as a raw and powerful filmmaker. While he doesn't have a lot of films under his belt he definitely showed us what he can do with Amores Perros and 21 Grams. Inarritu's friend and screenwriter, Guillermo Arriaga, has also established himself as a great writer. Arriaga is a great storyteller who does his best work when he writes in a non-linear fashion. The two match up perfectly and deliver us a raw, powerful, and emotional experience with Babel. The premise is an interesting one; how does one event affect people in three different locations around the world? The idea alone would cause any writer a headache just trying to make it work, but I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga make it work almost perfectly.<br /><br />  A Japanese hunter travels to Morocco and gives his rifle to his hunting guide as a present and a token of thanks. This hunting guide then sells the gun to a local man who herds goats in a small villiage. He leaves the gun with his sons and tells them to fend off any Jackals that try to kill the goats. While they are testing the gun the kids are convinced that the bullets don't go far, so they shoot at a tour bus that is driving down the road and think that nothing happens all until the bus swerves to a stop and panic ensues. An American couple on vacation (played by Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) are now in peril after the wife is shot during the incident. In the middle of nowhere it is pure chaos as the husband does everything in his limited power to save his wife. This incident now directly affects a Mexican woman back in San Diego, who is the housekeeper of the American couple in Morocco. Due to the incident, she is left with the kids in San Diego, but needs to leave to attend her son's wedding in Mexico. Without anybody to look after the kids she takes them along and things go from good to horribly bad as they try to cross back into the United States. Back in Japan we deal with the daughter of the Japanese hunter, who is deaf-mute. The Japanese storyline has the least to do with the central storyline, but is important nonetheless. This deaf girl lives a life of always being judged and ignored by people and only has her close friends who are also deaf-mute. She deals with sexual frustration since no man ever wants to even spend time with her, so she feels unloved and alone. These are the storylines.<br /><br />  The film switches back and forth between the storylines, but not in a linear fashion. We will see a section of one storyline and then jump back a bit to see the other one. So, simply, the screen is not split into thirds so we cannot see each storyline at the same time. We will see a part of one storyline, but during that time the other storylines are occurring so we need to jump back in time to catch up the other storylines. It may sound confusing, but trust me it really isn't. This film is incredibly easy to follow, and thankfully that allows the emotional impact to be so much greater. What I love about Inarritu and Arriaga is that they know the fundamental rule of film, and that is to \\"show, don't tell\\". They know that film is a visual medium and that's how they tell the story. The dialogue is minimal in the film, and there are many shots of people, faces, expressions, settings, etc. They really bring you to the different locations. The film is shot in the documentary \\"shakey\\" camera style, shot mostly or even all on digital from what I could tell. Although there were a few scenes that looked like it could have been film, so I'm not too sure about it. Anyway, the style works to captivate the audience completely. Some moments are so full of emotion that it will bring you to cry and tremble. The film is a dark and depressing look at the human condition, the way we have separated ourselves in our own respective cultures and how that causes conflict and friction. The film is also enhanced greatly by Gustavo Santaolalla's subtleand powerful score. Personally, I absolutely hated Brokeback Mountain's score and thought that it winning the Oscar was a travesty. However, I absolutely loved this score, it was truly phenomenal. Usually scores in films like these are not thematic, but this score was incredibly thematic and does wonders to enhance the visuals. Look for another Santaolalla nomination this year.<br /><br />  The Japanese storyline shows us that even in our own culture, the lack of communication completely isolates us. In a powerful scene we see the Japanese girl walk into a pulse pounding night club where the music is blasting and people are dancing. We switch back and forth from the girl's perspective where all we hear is silence. The scene evolves into an epileptic assault on the audience's senses, the scene goes way too long to make its point. It was the only scene I did not like in the entire film. Going to the Mexican storyline, we spend a lot of time at the wedding, lots of drinking and dancing. Then when the housekeeper tries to cross back into the states and she doesn't have a parent letter of permission things become scary. The main storyline back in Morocco is also harrowing. We see the impact on the Moroccan family where the sons are responsible for the shooting. There are some points in the film where you will be truly shaken to your core. Each storyline compliments the other one and communicates the same thing and that is that humans construct barriers to separate ourselves, but no matter how disconnected we may seem we all live on the same planet and we all affect each other.<br /><br />ACTING: Brad Pitt is labeled as the lead actor in the film, but there is not one actor that carries the film. Each storyline is headlined by different actors, and every single person who appears on screen in this film portrays incredibly real human emotion. Brad Pitt was stunning in the film, and Cate Blanchett was amazing as well. Adriana Barraza plays the Mexican housekeeper and I think she gives the best performance in the entire film. If the Academy does not nominate her performance then there is something seriously wrong with the voters. Some film enthusiasts will notice a few short roles by some famous people. Michael Pe&ntilde;a (Crash, World Trade Center) has a small role as a Border Control officer, and Clifton Collins Jr. (Capote) plays another Border Control officer. For those who think the little girl who plays the daughter of Brad Pitt's and Cate Blanchett's characters looks familiar, she should look familiar. The little girl is played by Elle Fanning, Dakota Fanning's little sister. Rinko Kikuchi plays Chieko, the deaf-mute Japanese girl. This young actress also gives a stunning and magnificent performance that should be recognized at the Oscars. Riveting performances all come together to communicate these stories<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: If you want to be compelled by a film, then Babel is the film to see. This is what a great film is. If you want to see masterful directing and writing then this is the perfect example, if you want to see stunning acting then this is the perfect example, but there were a few problems in the editing that bothered and if I could I would knock it down half a star (a feature Amazon should really have for its reviewers). This film needs to be experienced, so do yourself a favor and see it.absolutely hated Brokeback Mountain's score and thought that it winning the Oscar was a travesty.

0143058525|4.0|Enjoyed this quite a lot.  Learned a lot of things about Italy, India and Indonesia that I didn't know before. <br /> <br />This is not a novel, nor does it seem like one.  It's more of a travel narrative; still quite good to listen to.  I especially enjoyed the reader (the author, I believe).  She did a great job, which makes all the difference when listening to books on CD.
B00005JPC4|3.0|MOVIE: Ridley Scott has proven himself when it comes to comedy and light-hearted fares. While Thelma & Louise and Matchstick Men weren't exactly family films, they were certainly different than the action epics we know that Ridley Scott can masterfully do. Scott took a lot of heat for Kingdom Of Heaven, but for those who purchased and saw the director's cut know that the film was unjustly cut down and ruined. A Good Year on the other hand is just not a great project. The script doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before, it's just a schmaltzy tale about a man who learns some life lessons and falls in love in the process.<br /><br />  The problem with the movie is that has an incredibly hard time trying to find its footing. Ridley Scott knows how to use the setting to really capture the essence of a story, and he undoubtedly does that. However, there were some scenes where I was just wondering what was going on. It was as if I were watching a cartoon, especially in one scene where Russell Crowe drives around a fountain in his Smartcar in fast motion. Some choices I seriously questioned, and I usually don't question Ridley Scott. Okay, now let's move onto the positive side of the film. Once we get into the second act the film does indeed find its footing and stays with a consistent tone. We can finally relax and watch the movie for what it is. The characters are all really great even though they are pretty flat. The film is also beautifully shot, which is the essence of a Ridley Scott film. He contrasts England and France perfectly, and honestly I think that's the reason he took the project. When he read the script and saw that the essence of the film was a man out of place in his surroundings I'm sure that intrigued him. Unfortunately we don't go very far, and the lessons learned are pretty simple and not too meaningful. Visually the film is stunning, and musically there were some great choices. A lot of great songs are chosen to help the movie move along. Marc Streitenfield makes his head composer debut with A Good Year. Streitenfield previously worked with Hans Zimmer at Media Ventures and was a close assistant and editor for Zimmer. Streitenfield's score is very light and creates the right tone for the film, I cannot help but hear the similarities to previous Zimmer scores. As a Hans Zimmer fan I'm saying that in a good way though.<br /><br />ACTING: Russell Crowe is a great actor, whether you hate his real-life antics or not. He plays a stuck-up British stock broker who rekindles his childhood memories with his life loving uncle. He saves the movie and makes it entertaining to watch, and as an audience we can accept the fact that he is a bit cold-hearted and we want him to warm up. So, instead saying \\"hurry up and learn your life lesson\\", we can enjoy the character discovering the lessons for himself. The supporting cast also add great charm to the film's tone.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The film made me smile. I laughed a bit and felt good, especially during a scene where Russell Crowe drives by some French bikers, flips them off, and yells \\"LANCE ARMSTRONG!\\". The acting is decent and it's a good movie. The only problem is that the story is a bit unoriginal and the tone is rarely consistent. Wait for DVD, not a must see in theaters. Hopefully Ridley Scott will be more in his element when American Gangster comes out next year.itenfield makes his head composer debut with A Good Year.

B000084HAJ|5.0|ST.MARKS RINGS WITH THE MARVELOUS MUSIC OF MONTEVERDI AS SUNG SENSATIONALLY BY SOLOISTS AND THE MONTEVERDI SINGERS!    John Eliot Gardiner, more than other musician today, has been largely responsible for the huge upsurge of interest in Monteverdi's marvelous Vespers of 1610.  As an undergraduate at Cambridge, he formed the Monteverdi Choir for the first performance of this almost unheard of composition.  The Choir today enjoys an international reputation for the performance of a wide range of music.  In all their performances, over the past 25 years, the choir has been accompanied by the English Baroque Soloists, also founded by Gardiner in 1978.      This performance, which takes place in the Basilica of San Marco, Venice, includes the following groups in addition to the Choir and Baroque Soloists: His Magesties Sagbutts and Cornetts-London Oratory Junior Choir and vocal solists: Ann Monoyios & Marinella Pennicchi (sopranos); Michael Chance (countertenor); Mark Tucker,Nigel Robson,Sandro Naglia (tenors); Bryn Terfel, Alastair Miles (basses).      The origins of the Vespers are not known and it is not known if they were ever performed in Monteverdi's lifetime.  However, Gardiner contends that the work fits perfectly into the architecture and resonance of St. Mark's.  Monteverdi was a theatre composer par excellence as is shown by his operas \\"L'Orfeo\\" and \\"L'incoronazione di Poppea\\".  Even though much of this performance takes place on a central platform, he also positions singers, at various times, in pulpits, galleries and archways, creating extraordinary visual and acoustic effects.      This DVD displays not only the genius of Monteverdi, but the great creativity of Gardiner.  The package also includes  a Bonus section with John Eliot Gardiner talking about the making of the DVD and at the same time showing beautiful scenes of Venice and St. Marks.  This is such an enjoyable listening and visual treat!
B00008NRL8|5.0|Gotan Project's come back is definitely having its strong sweet revenge. The album is a collaboration of sexy tango modern classic beats. I love it and I know you would too!
B00005JKG9|5.0|A perfect movie. A truthfull face of the world of sales and what happens when your back is against the wall. Jack Lemmon's best performance.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|It's great to get this movie in full letterbox format, with a sparkling crisp image, and the extras such as overture, interval etc.  Lots of documentaries included too.  There is a sense of how great single lens cinerama must have been but of course you are watching this on a tv screen.  All the same the visuals are stunning and it hasn't dated much at all.  I hadn't realised how nasty James Garner could be.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I have waited years for 90210 -- the all time best show on TV -- to be released on DVD and  <br />I can't believe the whining on these posts! You could put in Holly Near's Imagine My Surprise and I'd still cherish these DVDs. As long as they don't edit out Brenda's infamous bitchy lip pursing and Kelly's ability to make the silliest lines believable I'm one happy camper. <br />When is season 2, their second junior year, being released?! <br />Elizabeth, Jersey, City, NJ
0743201140|2.0|I listened to a CD from the library.  Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test.   For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g.  <br />Deliberative <br />Ideation <br />Learner <br />Analytical <br />Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength. <br /> <br />If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU.   <br /> <br />
0060825219|5.0|This book is very important to me, especially as I'm going through relationship issues of my own.  I won't say much for those who have not yet read it, but I would suggest this book is excellent for those going through relationship change and evaluation.
B000002IWH|5.0|I hate recent soundtrack albums. It's riddled with \\"what's hot\\" songs and genre jumping bands that rarely compliment the movie. That's why I appreciate this album more for it's ability to capture the mood of the film than the songs themselves. But don't get me wrong, there are some amazing songs on this soundtrack.  The Cure's \\"Burn' (with crow cawing samples), a great NIN cover of Joy Division's \\"Dead Souls\\",and the fast paced industial tune \\"After The Flesh\\" from My Life With The Thrill Kill Cult, are all featured in the film and create an atmospheric backround for the movie's dark scenes. Even if you're not a big fan of the movie itself, the soundtrack gives listeners a great collection of some of the great songs from bands that were at their prime in the '90s.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|I have to admit, when it first came out, Hysteria didn't immediately impress me.  I liked it, but it seemed a little polished after the rough 'n tumble of Pyromania.  However, over a few months it grew and grew on me.  To this day, all these years later, I can still listen to it all the way through and love every moment.  It was the best album of it's era, I think.  Showing how you could layer guitars; have one play over a sustained note of the other, play the same rythmn but in complimentary keys, and still rock was a major achievement. <br /> <br />So, on to this remaster.  And oh, what a remaster!  This is how it's done, folks!  The sound quality is superb.  Lately I've bought a few remasters where all they seemed to do was pound up the bass track to the point of drowning out the guitar (Billy Idol's Rebel Yell, please stand and be counted).  No so on here - the sound is pumped up, but over the entire dynamic range so you end up with a more powerful album instead of just funked-up bass.  Wonderful. <br /> <br />The extra material, again, shows how a remaster should be done.  Why not throw in another album worth of songs?  Sure!  And they don't miss the mark, either.  I've been frothing at the mouth for YEARS to get my hands on a good copy of \\"Tear it Down,\\" and I don't mean the ghastly rehash on Adrenalize.  Here we get the proper original, remastered, along with the other great b-sides from Hysteria 45s.  Remember 45s?  No?  You still should buy this album! <br /> <br />The 2nd disk is definitely not throwaway material, either, with some remixes and live songs, all very well done. <br /> <br />What it all boils down to is that if you want the seminal album of 80's hard rock plus all the bonus goodies you could want, all in a great package that was PROPERLY remastered and sounds fantastic, this is for you.  No 80's cliche's here, this is the real thing.  All those bands that popped up after this hit the shelves are the pretenders, heavily made-up hairboys tryingto be this good and failing.  Highly recommended!
B000000I3O|4.0|Overall, this album was very well put together. MOst of it is The Misfits earlier material from the 80s from their first two albums: Walk Among us and Static Age. Their horror/goony/halloween theme found in all of their tracks are very original and lyrically well written. However, when Danzig got the boot and formed his own self-titled band, things got bad for The Misfits.  Their sound changed from edgy, upbeat, old school punk to heavily distorted and twisted heavy metal found on the tracks Wolf's Blood and Earth A.D.
0393061434|3.0|This is an easy read and is fairly interesting, but as I put it down, I feel a lot was missing. <br />1.  Book appears to have been put together by Woz telling stories to his not so ghost writer.  It jumps around a bit and is missing a lot of details. <br />2.  What happens?  I was suprised to know that he had been married 3 times?  His parents specifically is father plays a very important role in his development, but other than metioning that his father was drinking a lot later in his life, we don't know what happens to them?  Are they still alive or dead? <br />3.  I expected more about his time at Apple, but it appears that because Apple grew so quickly he drifted away from it quickly.   <br />4.  Just how much money does this guy have?  He spent millions on the US festivals and with 3 ex-wives, he still just does his own thing. <br />5.  I would love to see him write a book on electronic's and engineering.  That would be great!  Write about what he loves, without having to talk about himself. <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you love Woz, wait for the paperback, this book isn't worth the hardback price.
B000002LND|5.0|It's a wonderful CD if you like Madonna. Some of my favorite songs are included. I hadn't heard some of them since the 80's but they are still \\"goodies\\".
B000059QYB|5.0|You will really enjoy this CD. It has good tunes and great sound quality. I had never purchased a Billy Idol album/CD before, and watching the TV show \\"Rock Star\\" with its several Billy Idol selections done by the competitors made me realize how good Billy had been (where did he go?)and how many catchy dance tunes he gave us (thanks Billy). This old gal was dancing with herself in the kitchen and enjoying every minute of it. Enjoy.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have been smiling and singing all day after listening to this CD. I grew up with the Beatles, and this CD is song after song of pure delight. Bear in mind that this CD was put together to showcase just the hits that made it to the top of the charts - think of it as a great 'cliff notes' version of the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Given the brilliance and range of their entire catalogue, I doubt it would be possible to ever put together a single compilation CD to satisfy all Beatles fans. But this one does a great job of reminding us why they're still the greatest band in history.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I saw Fight Club in the theaters in '99, not knowing anything about Chuck Palahniuk at the time and figuring at best it would just be a decent action movie.  What I saw absolutely blew me away as a film that makes one *question* life, consumerism and where we're going as a society.  It was far better than any standard action/thriller could have been; so often it triggered in me brief moments of introspection (\\"how much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight\\", \\"if you died right now how would you feel about your life?\\", the whole Raymond K. Hessel scene); intellectual script-writing hilariously witty in some places and profoundly philosophical in others, and to top it all off probably the most innovative (albeit difficult to believe) surprise ending in film history cement Fight Club as a cult classic with a multi-layered, complex message that would make it perfect for a University student review essay. <br /> <br />Today, 7 years and several Palahniuk books, Fight Club tee shirts and posters later; after making my Internet banking, credit card, phone, online gaming and ISP logins \\"Tyler Durden\\"; after police found a bunch of high schoolers in another county in my state imitating the movie in a local barn when they were busted after coming home to their parents with bloody noses; after several people have read my email addy and quoted the movie or shot back a quick \\"Heyyy.... A FIGHT CLUB FAN!\\"- the movie remains needless to say, my all-time favorite.  There is very little grey area with people who've seen it (look no further than the rated reviews here)- most either like it or hate it.  If you're a more intellectual \\"thinker\\" and a little graphic violence and foul language doesn't easily offend you, give it a viewing (or read the novel if you're more bookworm than movie buff). <br /> <br />The sign of a good song is that its melody and lyrics stay in your head long after you've finished listening to it.  The sign of a good *movie* is not only that its scenes and classic one-liners from an extremely intelligently-written script replay in your mind because they're just THAT memorable, but that its message is so timely, relevant and resonant to modern life with many people that it's still talked about today.  There are message boards on the Net still discussing and debating new talking points about the movie TODAY, 7 years later; there aren't too many other films that have sparked this kind of intelligent, thoughtful and self-exploratory discussion that to this day is still ongoing.  Some of the more misogynistic scenes (\\"I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need\\") are cast in a new light given Palahniuk's recent coming out of the closet, surprising many fans. <br /> <br />On to the DVD itself.  I own many, and this one contains the most extra material including but not limited to extensive commentary, Fight Club paraphernelia, a couple hilarious PSA's and a cool music video.  It's considered by many to be one of the most comprehensive DVD's ever produced.  As to negatives: the film has some fairly graphic violence and a great deal of cussing & cursing, the latter of which detracts from a script (IMO).  If you can move past this, get this DVD or at least give it a rent and watch what is destined to be one of the most talked-about classics of all time.
0671042858|1.0|It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was \\"glued to it\\" or \\"thought it was a real page-turner\\" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a \\"cookie-cutter\\" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the \\"horror genre\\", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama.<br /><br />However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind \\"Insomnia\\" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking \\"oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?\\"<br /><br />THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable \\"generic\\" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very \\"generic\\" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product.<br /><br />Some examples of King's finest work would be \\"The Talisman\\", \\"Night Shift\\"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The \\"Dark Tower\\" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few.<br /><br />And if you have not read any of \\"The Bachman books\\" (King as Bachman) \\"Rage\\", \\"The Long Walk\\", Road Work\\", and \\"The Running Man\\", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.<br /><br />This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.
038572179X|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment....I had to struggle to finish it...we read it for Book Club and thought it was dreadful. <br />The climax of the book is in the first couple of chapters, very little character development....The story is boring and cold... <br />I would not recommend this book....

Great acting, great mysteries, some questions answered (that lead to even more questions), and a more complicated plot. It develops on the faith vs. science and fate vs. coincidence ideas... way cool. Plus, with a DVD, you can replay key scenes to find some of the hidden \\"easter eggs\\" this show has become known for.

B000HIVIOW|5.0|Based off the Raymond Briggs' book \\"The Snowman\\" this chalked drawn animation captures the magic of boy and his snowman coming to life to create a childhood memory that the boy would never forget. The musical score \\"composed by Howard Blake\\" captures a dream like feeling that is like no other.  It's been over twenty years since I first saw this animation and was moved by the artwork and music. I still feel as if I'm watching it for the first time when the holiday season approaches. \\"The Snowman\\" is a film that will be enjoyed for generations to come.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|Christmas is not Christmas to me without this film. Edmund Gwenn must come close to everybody's ideal of Santa Claus/Father Christmas, the kindly, good humored grandfather. The adult rules and casual opportunism  are no match for  childlike innocent warmth of the story.<br /><br />Kringle subsitutes at the Macy's Christmas Parade for the Company's drunken Santa and ends up being hired by Doris Walker (Maureen O'Hara) to play Santa in the store. All goes well for a while, even when he sents shoppers to rival stores for better bargains. Mr.Macy is quick use this as a gimmick when shoppers are so moved by a \\"big company putting the spirit ahead of the commercial\\" they promise to become loyal  Macy's customers.<br /><br />The trouble starts when Kringle begins to insist that he really IS Santa. He winds up in court before Judge Henry X. Harper (Gene Lockhart) for a hearing on his sanity. Political organiser Charlie Halloran (William Frawley:\\"I Love Lucy.\\") urges Harper to excuse himself from the case because he's coming up for election and the last thing he needs is a \\"no-win\\" controversy.<br /><br />The unfortunate Harper has already committed himself, but he is facile enough to put Kringle's lawyer, Fred Gailey (John Payne)in the hot seat. Gailey feels lost, but seizes on coincidence for a surprising and obvious solution!<br /><br />However Gailey's self-confidence, so boosted by triumph, is soon undermined by astonishing evidence of the Christmas spirit.<br /><br />The film was made in 1947 so some creative reading between the lines of such dialogue as, Maybe [Kringle's] only a little crazy, like some of those men in Washington,\\" have some allusions to the concurrent HUAC hearings. But then I may have been influenced by a lot or reading I've done about the period.

B00005JPAJ|5.0|Babel is a powerful film loaded with important themes and powerful, at times even operatic, emotions. Somehow the director takes what amounts to three short stories that would not have been particularly strong or extraordinary had they been presented as separate and distinct narratives and manages to infuse each of them with a heightened sense of significance and immediacy (and melodrama) by setting up a complex network of associations that suggests that all lives are delicately and intricately interwoven and that the littlest disturbance in any of our lives can potentialy explode into an international incident. In the world according to Inarritu since the smallest error in judgement (by an individual, a news agency, or national government) can lead to an international crisis there are no longer any such things as merely personal or localized decisions and events. In the world of Inarritu every decision and event has global significance.<br /><br />The main storyline (and I only call it the main story line because it is the one loaded with Hollywood star power) tells the story of a husband (Brad Pitt) and wife (Cate Blanchett) as they cope with some unspoken grief that has proven divisive in their relationship. We are uncertain, at first, just what it is that has destroyed their trust in each other. All we know is that when we meet them the lines of communication have been down for some time. As short story material goes this is pretty common terrain and stories that examine communication breakdowns have often been set in foreign locales (ie Antonioni's The Passenger, Bertolucci's Sheltering Sky) in order to underline just how isolated people can feel from one another. Inarritu, however, adds something unfamiliar to this familiar equation by having his American couple fall victim to a random act of violence while touring the Tunisian countryside and this suddenly places their very private story on headline news. Inarritu cleverly shows how the media can take an isolated event and turn it into an international incident. Whether the American media reports the story this way because it is misinformed, whether the American media is just guilty of jumping to conclusions, or whether the American media reports the story this way because this makes it more exciting to watch are questions raised by this film. Inarritu never loses focus on the intimate lives of his American couple but while maintaining that focus he also magnificently manages to examine how an out of control American media machine assesses, prioritizes, and implements a world agenda according to a racial and cultural hierarchy where wealthy white Americans are always the central pivot point of all stories, whether they be political events or human interest stories.  The choice of casting Brad Pitt in this role was brilliant and ironic.<br /><br />The second storyline (if we prioritize according to star power)involves another international incident, this one involving the American couples' kids who have been left in the care of a Mexican nanny. Despite the fact that this storyline affects the lives of several Mexican-Americans (though they are not Mexican-Americans in the legal sense they are Mexican-American in the truest sense as they have family and live their lives on both sides of the border) its really just the American kids that interest the authorities. In the eyes of the authorites the illegal immigrants are non-entities, criminals, or, even worse, animals that must be hunted and herded back across the border while the white American kids are treated as the only ones that are valued as human beings. This storyline examines the theme of citizenship and asks not just who deserves to be called an \\"American\\" but who deserves to be called a \\"human being\\" and to what extent these terms are used interchangably by the American authorities as they police a border which for many represents a barrier between hopelessness and hope. The most fascinating directorial choice ofBabel is not letting us know what ever happens to the other \\"star\\" of this picture: Gael Garcia Bernal. Is the fate of the Mexican (Gael Garcia Bernal) character any less important than the fate of the American (Brad Pitt) character? With this omission Inarritu draws attention to the cultural conditioning that has led us (film viewers of all kinds) to expect that its only the white Americans that have fates important enough to be considered and resolved.<br /><br />The Japan storyline is a virtually silent meditation on the power of the unmediated and unnarrated image to convey pure emotion; it looks at emotion as a deeper and purer language that may provide the cure for the empty cultural,racial,political (and other) rhetorics that divide our planet.not letting us know what ever happens to the other \\"star\\" of this picture: Gael Garcia Bernal.

B000HC2LI0|4.0|You already know whether or not you want this, the question is will you spend the money, especially if you've already bought the individual season sets like me. Well, here are some reasons why you might consider it:  <br />- All seasons are on single-sided discs. The biggest complaint about Seasons 1-3 was the use of double-sided discs, and rightfully so. Whoever thought up the idea should be shot.  <br />- It looks cool. The box is a leathery-looking dossier, and each of the seasons is in its own little file folder. Cute! <br />- There are a few extras not found in the season sets. If you like owning episode scripts, there are several. Also there's a new foreward by Aaron Sorkin. But that's about it.  <br />This may not be reason enough, but maybe you can get a good price for your season boxes on eBay...
0446615625|2.0|I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it.  Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy.  They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash \\"Author's Message\\" in neon lights.  First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message.  I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason.
0553801503|3.0|This book kind of sucked.  I hope that Martin still has something left because at this point he is ending books in a soap operatic fashion with crappy unfinished endings that leave the reader (watcher) on the edge of the couch.  It is gimicky and reflects weak or unsure plot development and writing.  Maybe he just wanted to stretch to more books for more money?  I think it is pretty pathetic.  Everyone was worried about him running down Jordan's path but it seems he found out how to turn something awesomely rich in detail, depth, action, and complexity into something complexly rich in putrescent useless filth.  Anytime an author has to end or start a book with an explanation of why it does not deliver what is expected or wanted beware for the fountain pen tapping the cesspool (i.e.Dark Tower Series).   <br /> <br />Still entertaining writing and some surprises, but is it still surprising when the formula is:  something or someone is good = almost certain death and destruction.  Evil, cheating, lying = success! (yea) <br /> <br />The formula is annoying when any gloriously huge pile of goodness is thwarted by a very simple monstrous act of evil.  I know this is more realistic than most fantasy but how far does he need to stack the deck before the gloriously just? Daenyrys comes in to save the 7 Kingdoms? <br /> <br />All my complaining without, I will ravenously devour each book he puts out , regardless how annoyingly he hooks me to read them.  Complex characters, hidden secrets, and mostly rational action blah blah blah.  So Martin has what most fantasy severly lacks.   <br /> <br />Everyone who has gotten this far has their own opinion and my drunken rantings will not change anything.  But this was a 600 page book that could very likely just be skipped in the series.  A voracious reader such as myself could not possible skip this book but if you are a casual reader and don't like Jordan's drawn out detail you can probably get away without reading this book at all.600 pages of transition is a bit much. <br /> <br />Martin thrives on having his characters do exaclty what the reader does not want them to do.  Maybe he can actually produce another book, another piece to the story, without intentionally antogonizing the reader into reading more. It is hard to believe that the story presented to us is exactly what he wanted to write.  Unless he naturally writes medieval fantasy identical to the writers of the crummy TV show Lost. <br /> <br />I might actually give this a 2.5.
1400097029|5.0|There is no doubt that The Sea is an excellent story.  John Banville pieces together broken memories and weaves these stories with the present.<br /><br />The protagonist Max returns to the Seaside where he spent much of his childhood.  Throughout his time there the picture of the past becomes more complete and better connected to the present.  It is truly a gradual uncovering of a story; not so much a mystery, but a novel which fills the reader with questions.<br /><br />The fact that this novel is so excellent cannot be attributed to the story itself, but to the strength of the prose as well.  The rich language is always used to convey some important idea:<br /><br />\\"Happiness was different in childhood.  It was much then a matter simply of accumulation, of taking things--new experiences, new emotions--and applying them like so many polished tiles to what would someday be the marvelously finished pavilion of the self.\\"<br /><br />The only downside to this book is that it can be slow at times.  This concern aside, the story is worth the read if you have grown tired of dime store thrillers and you seek something of substance.
038073186X|4.0|I thought this book was highly entertaining and apparently I was too stupid to figure out the twist, so that made it all the better.  This is the only Lehan book I have read but I would recommmend this easy read to anyone.  I did notice some anachronisms but they did not detract greatly from the book.  The characters make you care and this read is excellent.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I look forward to the new Pixar movie every year, and there is good reason for that. They keep pumping out clean entertainment, and \\"Cars\\" is no different.<br /><br />I found \\"Cars\\" to be quite different in its approach, as it kind of spoofs Nascar but glorifies it at the same time. I am not a Nascar fan, but I found this to be a truly funny movie. Because of the theme, you can enjoy this as a Nascar fan who has never seen Pixar before OR as a Pixar fan who has never followed Nascar. If you happen to like both--this movie is a bonus for you!<br /><br />The movie pulls all the right strings by being genuinely funny, teaching moral lessons, being romantic, and being melodramatic all at the same time. From that perspective, this may seem like so much cheese to some, and you can be warned. However, this is just part of the Pixar formula, and it seems to work every time.<br /><br />The artwork is grand, and the acting... errr... voices are good too. There are a large number of \\"cameo\\" appearances as well, and that just adds to the fun. Nothing like trying to play \\"spot the star\\" with a cartoon full of cars!!<br /><br />All I can say is, if you've enjoyed the previous Pixar films you will enjoy this, and if you've never seen another Pixar movie--now's a good time to start!
B000002H33|4.0|This is GREAT album by METALLICA.. It is not the very best one though. SONGS 1-8. <br /> <br />SIDE ONE <br />BATTERY-THIS IS MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM. I THINK IT ROCKS REALLY HARD!! <br /> <br />MASTER OF PUPPETS-GREAT SONG!! ONE OF THE BEST SONGS. <br /> <br />THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE-I REALLY DONT THINK THIS SONG IS ALL THAT GREAT. ITS OK.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|Greand Prix is a great racing film with a top notch cast. Although many fine racing movies have been <br />made this one is by far the best. Be sure you get widescreen DVD.
B000NTPDK0|4.0|I went to see this movie because I was a huge Princess Diana fan. When she was tragically killed it hit me (just like millions and millions of people around the world) very hard. She was so beautiful on the outside and on the inside. She was also very unique, because (perhaps?) she was the only member of this crazy family, the royals that had a heart and soul.     \\"The Queen\\" stars legendary veteran actress Helen Mirren who plays the title role. \\"The Queen\\" deals with both the public's reaction to Princess Diana's tragic death, as well as the Queen's/royal family's cold and unsympathetic feelings towards this tragedy.     I am not sure if the producers of \\"The Queen\\" were trying to shed a positive light on Queen Elizabeth? If they were though, it would have been nice if they would have discussed her life in greater detail so the viewers could gain a better understanding in to this complex individual.     But after watching this picture I really believe that the Queen is a very cold person. She is more interested in what the press has to say about her and her family, but she is never seen comforting her grandchildren or even talking to them!     Helen Mirren's portrayal of the Queen was really scary because she looked just like her! I have no idea how the Queen behaves in private but I can only suspect that Helen Mirren was really on the money because she acted just the way most people would probably expect the Queen to behave.     Michael Sheen played the newly elected Tony Blair. Did anyone else find it odd that a prime minister of one of the richest countries in the world was portrayed as a desperately middle-class man in a very middle-class home? I found that very unrealistic.     Tony Blair tried to evoke some type of humanity into the Queen after it was apparent to the British people that she did not give a hoot about poor Princess Diana. He even acted as publicity agent, spinning stories about the Queen's departure from London and tight-lipped stance. It seemed that he was trying to play both sides of the fence though, although he did win much brownie points for his involvement during this tragic time in British history.     I found the performance of Helen McCrory (playing Mrs. Cherie Blair) to be top-notch as well. She was very comical in many scenes (her curtsey to the Queen was so different), and she also lent a little bit of realism to this picture. Because as Cherie described, the Queen and her entire family are a bunch of emotionally retarded people.     Princess Diana was the most famous women in the world. Is that why the Windsors disliked her? I can only suspect that the reasons why the public (and the world, alike) loved her so much were the same reasons why the royal family detested her. Such a shame...
B000GY729M|2.0|All the songs on the album, except for When You Were Young, are a drag. It sounds like the songs were written on the fly. What happened to the melodies and retro synth sounds from Hot Fuss?! (I really liked that album.) I am not sure what direction The Killers were/are headed---I think they got lost in Sam's Town. To answer \\"we hope you enjoyed your stay\\" in track 12.... Not really. Sorry.
B000HIVO64|2.0|I'll have to say, I find it odd that Beck's getting so much love from the Amazon reviewers about his latest dud, The Information.  Some of it sounds alright, but NONE of it sounds fresh or inspired.  If it was put out by anyone else, I'd give it three stars; but I expect more from Beck.   <br /> <br />There's not much to say about this boring, underwhelming platter.  It almost seems like it was created by a focus group, cooked up to sound like a Beck CD.  But Beck's longtime fans know that Beck's CDs never used to sound like Beck CDs -- in other words, he's become predictable and safe.  What a Snoozer. <br /> <br />Beck has clearly jumped the shark.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|A small group of people led by Josh Lucas attempt to reach safety through the hull of a luxury liner which has turned upside down when struck by a rogue wave. This remake isn't as good as the original disaster movie, which had better character development and a more compelling post-disaster leader in Gene Hackman. Still, the graphics are sensational and the story pacing moves right along. Worth a look  - 3 1/2 stars.
B0001XTIUO|5.0|Parallelograms, Linda Perhacs' one and only album is well worth the price of admission.  It's great if mutual interest allows you to get into Perhacs, but other than that, pay no attention to the Joni Mitchell comparisons.  This album grooves on something really separate from Joni--there's something spacey, ethereal about Perhacs' delicate vocals, the music's subtle, trippy arrangements, and the way she deals with the subjects of her songs.  My personal favorite highlights are Chimacum Rain (check out the overdubbed vocals . . . this track really sets the tone for the album as reflective, and tinged with psychedelia), Paper Mountain Man (real groovy character sketch), the almost modal chant of Parallelograms, and the  immediately accessible Hey, Who Really Cares?  Throughout, the music matches the lyrics--Call of the River verges on tone poem, and on the rest, acoustic guitar flourishes illustrate moods and Perhacs' idiosyncratic observations.  The bonus tracks (as bonus tracks usually are), are not essential, although they do add to the singer's mystique, encompassing ALL of her recordings, EVER.  I recommend this album to fans of acoustic singer/songwriter fans, and especially those who like when performers bend the genre and get a little weird--Parallelograms certainly isn't content to rehash what's already been done.  It looks like the CD issue is getting scarcer--I'd urge prospective buyers to pick up a copy before it's prohibitively expensive--I think you'll find it's worth your money.
B000HEWEEY|5.0|There are now out *four* different versions of the 50th Anniversary edition of \\"Forbidden Planet\\": 2 standard (480i) DVD sets and 2 HD-DVD sets. Both formats are available as either a super-deluxe, Ultimate Collector's Edition set offered in a thick, green and red engraved hinged metal box, as well as a standard 2-disc sleeved set. Both come with lots extras, especially the metal Ultimate. I highly recommend them to everyone if you're so inclined toward lavish DVD sets. Being a longtime \\"Forbidden Planet\\" fan and collector, I'm planning on buying the other three variant sets, too, because, well, I'm obsessed with FP and by now have lost all sense of proportion when \\"collecting\\" this terrific film.<br /><br />The Ultimate Collector's Edition metal box set is described on its' outer, partial card stock cover--and be careful when removing this as it's tricky and can be easily torn--as being made of a \\"unique metal alloy.\\" (Hmm. Indestructible Krell metal perhaps???) Frankly, this deluxe set is everything I had hoped it would be, though I do have some quibble(see below). Overall, though, it's a beautiful package. One of the best super-deluxe DVD sets ever produced. It even includes a proper *gunmetal gray* 3.5\\" Robby (not black, as some supposed \\"film experts\\" have asserted for years) and a set of smallish FP lobby card reproductions in a printed sleeve. As an extra bonus for this release, you also get Robby's other 50s science fiction film \\"The Invisible Boy\\" and a set of smallish lobby card repros for it, too.<br /><br />At last this science fiction masterpiece (classic just isn't good enough) has gotten the super-deluxe treatment--and complete digital restoration--it has long deserved. The digital picture and 5.1 sound are a marvel. FP has never looked or sounded this good--ever! I've seen FP on the big CinemaScope screen a half a dozen times in the last 50 years, including a very nice 50th Anniversary revival house print. Plus, I have all the earlier video/laserdisc/DVD releases. I went over to a neighbor's home the evening I purchased this set (11-9-06) and watched a portion of this new digital remastering in 480p (progressive scan) on a 1-year old, 50\\" plasma display home theatre set-up. It was to die for. *TILT!* Even on my standard ratio 480i home theatre it looks spectacular. I can't imagine that FP could be much better looking in the new HD-DVD format. Let's face it, you can only push the film stock of a 50-year old CinemaScope print just so far, even when reformatting from a fine-grain vault print.<br /><br />While you can currently order these DVDs cheaper here, at least for the present, I decided to pay $10.00 more locally ($49.95, which included tax) for an early release just so I could have it *Right Now* and also so I could insure getting a pristine, undamaged, set. (I've had shipping/packing damage problems to the sides/edges when ordering other deluxe metal DVD sets through the mail, notably the 1933 \\"King Kong\\" and Disney \\"Tomorrowland\\" releases).<br /><br />Of special note on this set are two new documentaries done especially for the 50th Anniversary release: \\"Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet\\" and \\"Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon.\\" They're worth the price of this set alone, IMO. Very nicely done.<br /><br />My only disappointment--and I consider it a major oversight that the material was left out--is that virtually all of the supplementary material originally included on Criterion's 1989 two-disc (CAV) laserdisc release is not here. Especially MGM's original \\"Fatal Planet\\" screen treatment that clearly showed that FP started out as just another B-grade, bottom-of-the-bill programmer and then evolved into to a first-rate A production. However, scenes (and partial scenes) originally edited out of FP (taken from Louis and Bebe Barron's surviving original film score work print) are included in this new set as an extra. In fact, to my eye, it looks like the Criterion masters were used for this DVD transfer. For most this will be the first time these \\"lost\\" scenes will be seen. So I'm now planning on having the rest of that important \\"Making of Forbidden Planet\\" laserdisc material burned on to a DVD-R and then simply include it my copy of this new release.<br /><br />Frankly, I wouldn't have missed the extra \\"The Invisible Boy\\" feature that's also here, though it's obvious why it was offered in the set; or even the inaccurate 3.5\\" Robby miniature included--the shape of his head/carapace is wrong (too fat), among other detail problems. But that's just me. I have every confidence that this Ultimate Collector's Eition will receive high marks from both reviewers and fellow \\"Forbidden Planet\\" aficionados everywhere.<br /><br />BTW, for those that might not have seen them, issues #97 and #98 (from 2003 and still available from the publisher) of the long-running film magazine FilmFax contain an authoritative two-part article: \\"The Making of Forbidden Planet.\\" Both come highly recommended. This two-part article is similar in scope to the famous 20-year old \\"Forbidden Planet\\" double-issue of Cinefantastique (CFQ).

B000I5X81K|5.0|\\"Awake\\" is absolutely GLORIOUS--from \\"Mai\\" (\\"Never\\" sung in Italian), through every single track on this masterpiece, created from his heart and soul by Josh. We have waited for this since \\"Closer\\" and believe me, it is certainly worth every second we had to wait! Josh put so much of himself into this beautiful album--as vocal artist, composer, producer, pianist and drummer. His collaborations with other ubertalented musicians like Imogen Heap, Herbie Hancock, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Dave Mathews, Eric Moquet of Deep Forest, David Foster, and many top-notch instrumentalists have resulted in the ultimate album to enjoy and to give as gifts for any occasion. (Santa, are you listening? I can see \\"Awake\\" being slipped in lots of Christmas stockings this year.) Josh continues to astound and delight me and millions of others.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien Quadrilogy is, by far, the best boxed set of films that I own. You get both the original theatrical releases of each of the four films AND the extended/director's cuts plus countless excellent special features. You receive 9 discs. What a deal! Highly, highly recommended.
B000006OBQ|5.0|After 40 continuous years in print, millions of music lovers, across all possible genres and generations, are still shouting the praises of this recording. Originally issued as a 2-LP set, this is certainly the finest officially issued single-CD representation of Sinatra in a club setting, matched only by the recent 5-disc \\"Sinatra: Vegas\\" extravaganza (which itself features a CD of superb unreleased Sinatra-Basie Sands performances).  <br /> <br />Inspired by the unbelievable Count Basie orchestra, Frank Sinatra proves once and for all that he was the definitive big band/swing singer. By 1966, Sinatra's voice was no longer the pure instrument of the 1940s, or even the Capitol-era 1950s. However, through their sheer conviction and relentless rhythmic energy, the Sinatra-Basie combination immediately renders any vocal questions moot. No studio Sinatra recording - even the two excellent albums he recorded with Basie - possesses the bite or fury of the Sands renditions of \\"You Make Me Feel So Young,\\" \\"Fly Me To the Moon,\\" \\"Get Me To The Church On Time,\\" to name only a few. <br /> <br />And it's important to note that while Frank tended to be a little looser with his Vegas audiences (for instance, joking around more during the music), he's generally on very good behavior here, musically speaking. Granted, the man's comments and monologue can be seen as quite un-P.C., if we unfairly apply today's judgmental standards to it. (Psuedo-sensitive souls need not apply; Sinatra's track record on race and civil rights spoke for itself, then and now.)  <br /> <br />Minor quibbles aside (including the slightly botched lyric to \\"The Shadow of Your Smile,\\" which Sinatra apparently never got quite right during the Sands shows), this is an electrifying package. It should be noted that the remastered version has cleaned up many of the notorious tape splices found on the LP master. If you only need one live Sinatra album for your collection, this remains the gold standard.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Make no mistake; Kingdom of Heaven is a great movie and the additional forty-seven minutes in the Directors Cut is a welcome addition. True, it may not be factually accurate to what we know of the crusades but what we know isn't very precise. There were no real chroniclers of the events that unfolded. What we know is sketchy at best and of course viewed and skewed from the Christian perspective.<br /><br />The movie stars Orlando Bloom as Balian, a French blacksmith. His estranged father Godfrey (Liam Neeson) a knight of Jerusalem, with a small contingent of men, visits to acquaint himself with his son. It is a time of personal anguish for Balian who is in mourning. His wife had just committed suicide after the death of their infant and a dogmatic local priest is having her disinterred so he can cut off her head. A custom, the movie explains, with those who commit suicide, so their soul cannot find their way to heaven. After Balian gives his absentee father a cool reception and sends him on his way, in a fit of rage, he kills the priest, while his shop burns to the ground.<br /><br />Now a fugitive, he seeks succor from his father and catches up with his group in time to fight off his pursuers. Though they vanquish the pursuers, Godfrey falls and dies in the arms of Balian, whom he tasks to take his place in Jerusalem. Thus begins an odyssey which finds the lowly blacksmith, Balian, not only thrown into a lordship but eventually leading the defense of Jerusalem against a provoked hoard of Muslims led by the legendary Egyptian general, Saladeen.<br /><br />Bloom and Neeson's performances are excellent and I even pictured the bearded Bloom as a young Errol Flynn. Other noteworthy members of the giant cast are Jeremy Irons as Tiberius - the kings regent, Ed Norten as the leprous King of Jerusalem and Eva Green as the King's sister and Balian's love interest.<br /><br />This was the first movie I have seen with the lovely Eva Green since her saucy performance in the highly erotic Dreamers. Although I enjoyed viewing her in the altogether it was nice to see her clothed and moving on to bigger things.<br /><br />The pomp and grandeur of the movie cannot be overstated. The cast overall was magnificent as were the truly imaginative battle scenes. The colorful costuming was spectacular and the sets, especially Jerusalem were superb.<br /><br />The additional scenes that I observed, which were included in the Director's Cut included the beginning, previous to where Balien killed his conniving brother, also a priest. Other additions included the young prince (Sybella's son) who becomes King after his uncle's death only to be diagnosed with Leprosy.

Although I enjoyed viewing her in the altogether it was nice to see her clothed and moving on to bigger things.  <br /> <br />The pomp and grandeur of the movie cannot be overstated. The cast overall was magnificent as were the truly imaginative battle scenes. The colorful costuming was spectacular and the sets, especially Jerusalem were superb.  <br /> <br />The additional scenes that I observed, which were included in the Director's Cut included the beginning, previous to where Balien killed his conniving brother, also a priest. Other additions included the young prince (Sybella's son) who becomes King after his uncle's death only to be diagnosed with Leprosy.

B000026258|5.0|Music for 18 Musicians is a minimalist masterpiece. Minimalism is not a readily accepted or appreciated genre of modern classical music, so I suggest you listen to the piece before you buy it. Even if you don't like it upon the first listen, I would encourage you to try and appreciate it anyway. The first time I heard \\"In C\\" by Terry Riley, I was not particularly enthralled. The more I listen to pieces like this one, the more they grow on me. Reich's piece written for violin, cello, 2 clarinets doubling bass clarinet, 4 pianos, 3 mirimbas, 2 xylophones, 1 metallophone and 4 women's voices is structured in a way unlike much of what people think of as classical music. It starts with a steady pulse from the instruments with different instruments swelling and fading while the instruments outline a series of simple chords. What follows is a set of variations in which different instruments and voices sing different melodic motives on top of one another to create an intricate contrapuntal texture over the steady pulse. Many will call it monotonous, I like to think it is somewhat mesmerizing. And if the composer and his ensemble perform the work, it must be about as close to the sound Reich envisioned.<br /><br />For those who see this music as uninteresting and monotonous, I would like to explain what makes the piece more than just of bunch of stacatto eigth note chords played in what seems like eternal succession. The whole concept of \\"Music for 18 Musicians,\\" is that the music just breathes. Reich writes in the liner notes that the whole concept of the piece is to allow the musicians to repeat the motives for as long as a deep breath will allow them to comfotablly play for before they reiterate the phrase. The result is music that seems to be inhaling and exhaling as someone meditating in the lotus position. The musical breaths create an atmospheric sonic tapestry that is incredibly relaxing. If you keep this in mind, you may be able to better appreciate Reich's famous work. If you're like me, you'll walk away from the piece as if you were walking on air.work. If you're like me, you'll walk away from the piece as if you were walking on air.

B000FUF6QS|4.0|...or so says one famous reviewer of this film.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the weird song and dance routine that a nude Ms Eklund delivers pretty early on hasn't changed my mind about this one.<br /><br />I liked the movie the first time I saw it and still do, almost 25 years later.<br /><br />It is weird, it is creepy and it so 70s! Perfectly authentic back in the day, the music and clothing and hairstyles add a certain flavor the remake just does not have.<br /><br />Edward Woodward's much praised performance as Officer Howie didn't touch me at all. It was Christopher Lee's totally believable turn as Lord Summerisle that did it for me and I bet it will stick with you, long after you've seen it the first time. Nothing he does is out of place, even when you see him dancing about in the ritual processional near the end.<br /><br />All comparisons to Cher aside, his getup and wig don't detract from his performance.<br /><br />Memorable scenes:<br /><br />the processional and the costumed villagers, as described above<br /><br />the mother giving her child a toad to suck<br /><br />the woman breastfeeding her child, while holding an egg in one hand and sitting on a tombstone<br /><br />a nude Britt Eklund go-go dancing, her siren song wailing away in the background<br /><br />the people who suddenly pop up from behind the sea wall, with the animal masks on<br /><br />the hand of glory<br /><br />You must see this film if you plan on watching the remake, as it is truly a British classic. I hesitate to call it a horror film, it is more of a suspense thriller.<br /><br />There is a lot of nudity, a few sexual situations, one cut-off hand sequence and some mildly surprising/scary scenes sprinkled thruout the film. I was never once scared or horrified while watching it (although I did feel a bit like laughing out loud while watching Britt boogie).<br /><br />Compared to a movie like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Cabin Fever, this film is relatively harmless for mature children or teenagers to watch.en or teenagers to watch.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|Considering all the other reviews and some comments I've read on Internet forums, I have basically three things to say:    1) Anyone judging the picture quality by today's standards is missing the point. This is archival footage, not concerts shot especially for release, where all the cameras and microphones are strategically placed, some numbers are played again because they didn't get it right the first time and additional footage is shot after the actual show. In fact, we Kiss fans should be thankful these concerts were videotaped at all! We're talking '74-'77 here. \\"Acrobat\\" looks like footage from the silent Super-8 film originally shown on the \\"Vintage\\" DVD with the audio dubbed in, but it works. The Easter Egg with Kiss playing at Ace's wedding is too dark, but it's the historical value that counts. And you can confirm that it is really from the wedding by checking the pictures that appear in the \\"Kiss and Tell\\" book.    2) So most of this material has been long available on bootleg. So what? Do you really expect the musicians themselves to take this into consideration? Personally, I always prefer official material, even if it looks and sounds exactly the same as the bootlegs. Now it's all in one place on a properly pressed DVD and a nice package. For me, at least, it does make an enormous difference.    3) This is a first in the music video market. Queen has given us a few concerts one at a time, but we know there is more in the vaults. Both the Rolling Stones and Elton John have released an overdose of recent footage in their respective 4-DVD sets, while the best stuff remains in the can. The Beatles have included bits and pieces in the \\"Anthology\\" series, but not complete performances. Kiss has started a new trend, here. I hope other acts follow suit: David Bowie, Genesis, Elton John, are you listening?
B0001B55PS|4.0|I purchased this cd from Amazon and the edition I received is actually an Australian edition. The bonus DVD includes the videos for \\"Born to Try,\\" and \\"Lost Without You\\" as well as \\"Born to Try\\" live (recorded in/on a studio/set), and some behind the scenes footage of Ms.goodrem.(basically short \\"the makings of\\" the two videos and some clips from when she was in London).    For the price, 10.99, this is a great cd/dvd package. (as Amazon seems to sell other editions from 16.99-19.99-to 20 something dollars, and this edition has the bonus dvd that others don't seem to include)    For those of you wondering if the dvd will play- as it is in PAL format-It played fine on my computer's dvd player-so I think it will probably play on most dvd players.    As other reviewers have mentioned, Ms. Goodrem has a beautiful voice. However if you like more upbeat pop. You should buy her second album \\"mistaken identity\\" as the songs are a little more upbeat (and she shows more range). This album is good but most (ok..basically all) of the songs are ballads. (a few of the songs sound similar)    Also, if you're thinking about buying this album I would note that its very much \\"straight\\" pop with some occasional alt. cont. leanings... it definitely does not have an R&B edge. Also besides 5 or 6 standout songs (born to try, innocent eyes, etc..)the production on this album can feel somewhat bland and sometimes a little overpowering...    Ms.Goodrem has a good voice, however she does not have the most distinctive voice, (as compared to other pop singers such as Kelly Clarkson, Leann Rimes, or Monica) but her voice is very pleasant, fairly strong, and you have to give her credit for choosing the songs that best compliment her voice. She co/wrote or wrote many of the songs herself.
B000IOM0YM|3.0|This dvd is certainly entertaining much more than recent garbage they have put out.  1-why could they not have put some other material in their concerts?-DESTROYER and ROCK AND ROLL OVER(yrs?), 2-it does a good job of relating some classic material, but where is the TOMORROW show segment with TOM SNYDER?--classic fodder if not hilarious, 3-why not throw in the KISS MEETS THE PHANTOM movie?---I realize that both of the last 2 inserts are probably not showing KISS in a more positive light but cmon, its good stuff.  I have always enjoyed KISS and their material(same, lame or tame-styles) and they have made me mad for their FRUGAL amount of new or unreleased material to satisfy their fans.  however, I will say that the dvds are fun to watch.  the dvds suffers from the period in which film techniques etc where used mid-70's.  the audio is suprisingly ok and video have their moments but overall its lacks different material-songs.  BESTBUY is giving away an extra dvd of a concert and its ok but still redundant.  KISS, you may made alot of money but somehow you still do not understanding the word -- SHARING.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Considering this set sells for $369.99 at the mall, this was an awesome price. Yeah its still $179 but if you werent a fan you wouldnt be looking at it! Buy it now before the price goes up! <br />As for the remastered episodes...yeah they are cool but so what??
B000002U8G|5.0|This is the album where Post-Syd Floyd really comes into its own. Every track is a keeper, even if \\"Seamus\\" might feel a little like filler. \\"One of these Days\\" is a killer instrumental, remniscent of King Crimson. Though all of the tracks are noteworthy, including the unfairly criticized, beautifully jazzy \\"San Tropez\\" it is the first track, the previously mentioned \\"One of these Days\\" and the epic \\"Echoes\\" which truly stand out as all-time Floyd classics. Echoes is very atmospheric and uniquely beautiful; over 20 minutes in length, it passes by much more quickly than would be imagined, practically hypnotizing the listener into a trance. Any fan of Floyd that has the other classics and wonders where to go next is recommended to check out Meddle. I may even go as far as calling it essential listening for Floyd fans if not for all classic rock/progessive rock fans; it is a fine and thoroughly enjoyable album that is infinitely relistenable and entrancing.
0596007124|5.0|An excellent common sense view of practical patterns for programming. Avoids the pitfall of becoming too academic that a lot of patterns books make.
B000024D4R|5.0|For whatever reason, several critics and fans seem to either dislike or not appreciate this Floyd masterpiece. Animals is a chillingly dark, innovative, and powerful album that rewards multiple listens but due to its heavy guitar and more straightforward (less atmospheric) music, it is easier to get into on first listen than many of their albums. The first and last song (Pigs on a Wing 1 and 2) are effective bookends to the album, but it is the middle section comprised of three longer songs, Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep, that really shines. Each of the three aforementioned tracks ranks among the band's finest ever. The sound effects are minimal, typically just animal sounds along with lots of guitar and (yes effective and not annoying)synth. Gilmour's playing on this album is truly phenomenal and his vocals are good, though Waters beigns to take more of a lead vocalist role on this album. Waters's dramatic vocals are the right choice and lend urgency to the songs; Gilmour has a good voice but it would not have worked as well as Roger's here. The lyrics are darkly reminiscent of Animal Farm and the music is very unique with hints of Floyd classics (such as some recycled riffs and motifs, even sound effects such as the dog barking that orignally appeared on Meddle's \\"Seamus,\\"but rather than bog the album down, they somehow enhance it)and some music that sounds like nothing else I've ever heard. My favorite track is the snarling Pigs, with its brilliant lyrics, (\\"You're almost a laugh, but you're really a cryyy!\\"), frantic vocals, cool interplay of synth/pig effects with the vocals, and Gilmour's tasy guitar at the end. Animals is truly a special album and should not be missed. Any true Floyd fan will find it interesting, if not brilliant (I obviously find it brilliant;)!

B000002C1W|2.0|How appropriate that beds are on the cover, as this is the first of Pink Floyd albums that qualifies as just a collector's item for Floyd fanatics and will positively put anyone else (and some fanatics like myself) to sleep. There are so many great Floyd albums, don't buy this one unless you are curious about the \\"bad Floyd album\\" and want to see if it could really be that bad... it is not that it's terrible, but just for Floyd, it is extremely mediocre.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this cd is by far one of the greatest things i have ever heard, and this is coming from a guy who listens to slipknot, trivium, korn and stuff like that but i've always had a softer side to and this album pulls it right out of me.<br /><br />  right from the begining i knew that the slow drum tapping beat and low bass where gonna go somewhere and sure enough at 4:09 comes the first hard riff and it was so awsome how they led up to it though that the whole rest of the cd i could'nt switch or fast forword any of the other songs, i had to hear them all the way through. even when it came to \\"the nurse who loved me\\". at first i was like, huh , eeh, but after a couple times listening and hearing the lyrics i won't change it, even to the day if it comes on in my car my friends are listening to it, like it or not.<br /><br />  all the radio song where great, if you don't know them you must have been living under a rock. but when i got this cd i got it with \\"aMOTION\\" THE DVD-REMIX CD SET, and when i got home i watched the dvd first and saw the \\"counting bodys like sheep\\" video and loved it, then come to my suprise on \\"thirteenth step\\" number 10 \\"pet\\" has the same lyrics but is definently not the same song(if you've heard, you know what i mean)but it was'nt til later when i got \\"eMOTIVe\\" that my friend told me it was a complete cover album pretty much, then after i listened to it i saw that they covered their own song \\"pet\\"(who else has ideas like this) and ever since i figured that out \\"pet\\" has always been my favorite song on this album. and this album is a most have for ANYBODY!!! (DEATH METAL AND RAP FAN, OPEN YOUR F#*KING MINDS)
B0007XH5OY|5.0|No doubt this was a brilliant album when it first came out. It could even be thought of as the start of \\"heavy metal\\" predating the first Zeppelin album. The good news here is that this all-time classic has improved in this excellent remaster; the sound is much improved, especially the guitars, and the bonus tracks are wonderful (there are interesting alternate takes/diff. mixes, the three singles which are well worth having, and \\"I've Been Drinking\\" which was originally a B-side to a single and is one of the group's best efforts). A young Rod Stewart, still full of rock n roll fire, sings passionately throughout and virtuoso Jeff Beck plays breathtaking guitar. Among other notables are Ron Wood who plays bass here and legendary guests such as future Zep members Page and John Paul Jones,Who drummer Keith Moon, and Zappa drummer Aynsley Dunbar. Highly recommended classic and often overlooked recording in its definitive version. I would like to also note that it is one of the most reasonably priced import remasters I have ever purchased.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|This movie has great breeding! Great cast with some fine performances (esp. Jeffrey Wright and George Clooney, as one would expect). Great writer/director, Stephen Gaghan, fresh off of the superb Traffic.<br /><br />But for a variety of reasons, this movie just did not rise to the same level as Traffic. I suppose a great deal of the fault lies with me as a lazy viewer. I'm just not into the whole Corporate Intrigue aspect of the movie. To be sure, there are many other important strands in the weave of the Oil Web presented by the script - but the finagling and politicking involved with the oil deal that is the crux of the film was just dull. Which of course is part of the \\"message\\" of the movie - most oil consumers (Americans in particular) are uninterested in where the oil comes from - just as long as it is affordable and available.<br /><br />I suppose my disappointment stems more from watching the movie with the preconceived notion that it would be more unto a Ludlam versus Clancy type novel.<br /><br />The movie was NOT a waste of time - it just failed to live up to the hype.
B000IOM1RI|3.0|Overall, this album was a disappointment. I put it into my CD player and was surprised to get through it so quickly. The album is just over half an hour and does not compare with The D's self-titled debut. I love Jack and Kyle, but I think that the duo could have put a little bit more effort into this album than they did. Two of the songs on this album date back to Tenacious D's HBO TV series (Master Exploder and History). Both of which are TD classics. The title track POD and The Government Totally Sucks are a pair of great tracks as well. This is still a great band, and a true fan will still buy the album, just dont be expecting a classic like their debut. All I can say is that I hope the movie doesn't let me down.
B00006I53S|5.0|I use this all the time at my son's soccer games and get great shots. It's a little on the bigger side, but isn't too heavy and image stabilization really helps out.
B000I5X81A|4.0|Because I like much of JJC's and EC's music, I bought this album unheard. I read the liner notes before playing and when I saw that there were no less than 25 session musicians and that Simon Climie had co-produced, I thought that I was in for a large dose of 'production overkill'. However, this turned out not to be the case (there is some occasional fuzziness to the sound, but this was a minor distraction only).<br /><br />THE SONGS : 11 of the 14 tracks are penned by JJC and they are typical of his 'art' - simple, yet infectious, country blues with a slight 'world weary' feel to them. On this album, the main difference is that the sound is much richer and 'warmer' than that normally associated with JJC. Two of the songs ('Anyway the Wind Blows' and 'Don't Cry Sister') are re-makes of originals released in the late 70's and I must admit to actually preferring these songs with the more 'lush' sound of this album.<br /><br />THE VOCALS : Shared, more or less, evenly between EC and JJC (harmony and solos) - EC having a slightly bigger share of the solo vocals. Both artists are in in good form.<br /><br />THE PLAYING : Most tracks feature some really mellow guitar (although the solos are fairly short). At times, I couldn't tell who was playing (the liner notes don't give credits on an individual track basis) but I believe most of the lead playing is by EC with JJC making briefer contributions (but that clear and incisive guitar sound, featured on some of his 70's playing, is still there). Instrumental variety is further enhanced by organ and piano on some tracks.<br /><br />A few comments about my favourite tracks (songwriters in brackets):<br /><br />DANGER (J J Cale) - Upbeat 'poppy' song with a short, wistful guitar solo and some deft organ playing by Billy Preston; at 5 1/2 minutes, perhaps a bit too long.<br /><br />ITS EASY (J J Cale) - This one just 'boogies' along; great guitar solo.<br /><br />HARD TO THRILL (Eric Clapton/John Mayer) - Contemporary blues with a 'moody' sound. Great vocals by EC, great guitar solo (possibly by EC and/or John Mayer) and some nice piano also.<br /><br />LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT (J J Cale) - Slowish boogie with a very bluesy sound, great guitar by EC; great piano playing too on this one.<br /><br />WHO AM I TELLING YOU? (J J Cale) - A beautiful song this; I liked the bluesy piano and the poignant slide guitar solo towards the end - I'm assuming this was Derek Trucks; I'm not very familiar with his music (I've led a cloistered life in recent years) but I thought the playing was absolutely exquisite.<br /><br />There was only one track I didn't like - THREE LITTLE GIRLS (Eric Clapton) - seems out of place on this album; I thought it was a rather unexceptional song with over-sentimental lyrics.<br /><br />I think this album is a fine example of 'laid back american' music at its best. Whilst it may not appeal to a very wide audience, JJC fans should be more than happy with it (providing the 'fuller' production isn't an issue) - it is, essentially, an album which is heavily influenced by JJC's music and style. Also, if you like EC albums such as 'Backless' and 'Money and Cigarettes', then you will probably like this album as well.a 'moody' sound.

B000IOM0YM|5.0|Since the late 1970's, when Kiss peaked and lost their musical direction, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley have had three trump cards that they could use to return many of their fans.  When Kiss bottomed out in the early 1980's, shortly after Peter Criss and Ace Frehley left the band, they played their first trump card, taking off their makeup and costumes.  Kiss then jumped on the Hair Metal bandwagon and road it for all that it was worth.  When the Hair Metal fad finally dried up in the 1990's Gene and Paul played their second trump card, getting back together with Peter and Ace and putting their makeup and costumes back on.  Now that Peter and Ace have left the band again and the never ending Kiss Farewell Tour with a mock cat drummer and a mock space guitarist have alienated many fans, Gene and Paul are playing their third trump card.  They have opened the Kiss vault to release full concerts and television footage of KISS back in the 1970's.  This is indeed the ultimate trump card, allowing fans to watch from the comfort of their own homes five KISS concerts (the fifth one on a bonus DVD) of the original lineup back in the 1970's.  This is KISS back when they were hungry and raising the bar for rock concerts.  The price of this DVD set is reasonable too.  Twenty bucks for what they could have easily charged fifty to a hundred bucks.  I sincerely hope that the majority Kiss fans, including casual Kiss fans, won't be so disillusioned by the last six years of Kiss that they miss out on this DVD set.  Trump card or not, this is a true treasure for any Kiss fan!  This is KISS at their best!!
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Monster riffs and guitar solos? Check. Thumping bass that doesn't always follow the guitars? Check. Tight drumming? Check. Technicality AND well crafted songs? Checkmate! This is Megadave...oops, I mean Megadeth's best album. Every song on here is well done, especially Holy Wars. In fact, even if Holy Wars was the only song on this release it would still be worth every shinny penny spent. Yes it is true that the vocals are new, but I did not even notice it at first. It was not until after getting a chance to listen to an original pressing that I heard the distinct difference, not that it makes the songs unlistenable. Quite the contrary, this remastered addition is even better than the original. I also recommend Megadeth's first album and Peace Sells.
0385605994|5.0|The Amulet of Samarkand is one of the best books I've ever read! It is so interesting and out of the normal that I just couldn't put it down! I have read this book so many times it's insane. The Trilogy in itself is enthralling and heart-wrenching. This is great for a kid who needs a good book report book or just something interesting to read. I would suggest this book to anyone over 11. Great Stuff!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|I have been reading all of the comments here and it is so interesting how all of the \\"1\\" ratings don't seem to have much scientific proof to back up their disagreement with the movie other than \\"Al Gore is just sore for losing an election\\" or \\"Smoking has nothing to do with global warming.\\" Seems like the same people like to defend the same causes (all which lend damage to the environment). <br /> <br />Why not take some responsibility for a change? This movie has certainly raised some interesting questions and should be taken seriously. If you disagree with the facts then research it for yourself, but don't use talk radio as your source for information. That's just lazy. Some of the \\"1\\" ratings do agree \\"While Global Warming is an important issue and we certainly do have something to do with the rapidity of the process, if you want serious facts and the actual truth for a change, this isn't the movie for you\\" (taken from a previous posting), then what is the movie for us? You're not going to recommend another science fiction movie I hope. If you believe global warming is an issue you would have at least given this movie a two or three, but maybe the brain washing isn't on this side. Hmm Hmm. <br /> <br />This is definately the movie for you and all others. It's ignorant to think that humans have no fault in the condition of the environment. We have had the power to destroy the ozone layer and aid in it's repair. That's pretty amazing. I think we can do the same for global warming. Like I said, if you don't agree with all the facts then do some research, but don't just ignore the situation at hand. We have a problem and we need to start doing something about it before it's too late.
B000JIHP88|1.0|This mobile looked and sounded (from the description) like a great mobile.  Our son loves to watch things move and loves animals.  Unfortunately the music was SO soft even on the loudest setting and the mobile itself was SOOOO slow that it would not keep his attention at all.  Looks like a great mobile but just didn't live up to its description.  Also, if you have a crib that does not have straight sides (e.g. there are some curves) the mobile attaches to it but it's very temperamental when it comes to the movement - you have to move the mobile to try to get it to work.  Not the best unfortunately.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|Can I catch my breath?  It's only been 13 years since Bat 2 and I've yet to recover from that, and now this...  I played the HELL out of Bat 2 back in the day and when I heard about Bat 3, I was first in line to get it.  It takes up where Bat 2 left off, just as if It was recorded back then and left in a vault.  What passion, the guy gives us his all, which is twice as much as most everyone else.  Wish Jim could have played a bigger part, but he is still very much there.  This is an instant classic like the other two Bats.  A Home Run!!!
B000JCETDS|5.0|I've been jonesin' for The D's new album for a long time.  I scored \\"Tenacious D The Pick of Destiny\\" a day early because I pre-ordered it from their website along with a nifty t-shirt, tarot cards, a mini-poster and a plastic replica of the Pick of Destiny itself!  I am a D-ciple and it was a birthday gift for my twin sister.  This soundtrack makes me want to see the movie even more so.   <br /> <br />The album is great.  It's good.  It rocks your socks off.  The D is the greatest band on Earth.  The album is filled to the brim with explicit lyrics.  Jack Black likes to use the \\"F word\\" but it works.  It wouldn't be The D without the F-bomb tossed around every once in awhile.  I don't mind because I don't get offended and abhor censorship.   <br /> <br />JB and KG rule this album as if they are truly fueled by the Satan.  The opening track, \\"Kickapoo,\\" has vocals by Jack Black, Meat Loaf and Ronnie James Dio!  \\"Classico\\" is a different take on a classic Tenacious D song.  Anyone familiar with \\"Tenacious D - The Complete Master Works\\" (2003) will know what I am talking about.  \\"Baby\\" is a nice ballad with JB's vocals morphing into a baby cry at the end, which made me laugh out loud.  JB shows his vocal talent in the screaming, screeching, singing \\"Master Exploder.\\"  The feel-good song of the album, \\"Papagenu (He's My Sassafrass),\\" is catchy and you cannot turn it off.  The song makes you want to leap around in green meadows.  \\"Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)\\" is the mother of all songs, with JB and KG rocking off against the Satan.  <br /> <br />The album flows from one track to another, displaying all manners of rock and comedy in the epic style only The D can achieve with acoustic guitars, flutes, spoken word, heavy metal and sweeping vocals.  The one thing that sours me about this album is that it is only 34 minutes long.  It's too short and makes the listener crave more.   <br /> <br />I was never a big fan of metal, but The D changed that.  I'm a metal fiend now.  I look forward to hearing live performances of these songs on November 22, 2006, the day that the movie \\"Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny\\" is released in theatres.  Why you ask?  Because I am seeing The D live on that day here in Denver!  I believe JB will forgive the crowd for seeing The D perform instead of seeing the movie.
B00005JNS0|5.0|First of all, this is a Pixar film. What this means is that this is a well-made, incredibly visualized film with a good story, strong characters, and a plot moral to make you feel things both during and after the film is done. While this film may not be quite as strong as others in the Pixar canon, it stands up quite well on its own. The basic line of the story is to take the time in life to realize what's really important in life. To not go-go-go at breakneck speed at all times, or you'll miss out on so much that life has to offer. A big parallel is drawn between the Interstate, and the more winding Route 66. We race through life on the Interstate, when we could take the scenic route on an old winding road and see and learn so much more, about ourselves and life in general. One thing I really enjoyed in this film was the strong sense of nostalgia it evoked. So many towns withered and died when their access roads suddenly were cut off by new highways. Many just didn't make it when the travelers stopped coming through, and by the magic of film, we're presented with one that almost completely dies, then comes back to life. As is usual for Pixar, the voice-over work is inspired, with many Pixar-veterans at work again here. The sound is wonderful, with the roar of a full-scale race doing laps through my surround-sound system. The picture quality is exceptional, the cars here gleam like I wish mine did! Oh well, that's the magic of movies! This fine film keeps Pixar's winning streak rolling on, what is it now, seven straight hits with no bombs anywhere? Anyway, get this film for yourself and take the time to enjoy a little side trip down Route 66.

B000G1T072|2.0|The Incredible Bongo Band is probably not a band most people have heard of, but one of their songs, \\"Apache\\" is one of the most sampled songs in hip-hop especially by old school acts of the 80's.  Run-DMC, LL Cool J, Nas, The Geto Boys, The Ultramagnetic MC's, Grandmaster Flash, KRS-One, Kool Moe Dee and countless others have used the drum break from the song (The Sugarhill Gang had a minor hit with \\"Apache Rap\\").  The group wasn't really a group at all, but a studio concoction of session players who were quickly assembled in 1972 to round out a soundtrack album (the less than memorable The Thing With Two Heads) with two tracks.  Those two tracks, \\"Bongo Rock\\" & \\"Bongolia\\", led to the full-length album Bongo Rock and the follow-up Return Of The Incredible Bongo Band.  If you are a fan of 70's style funk music, then this is an album for you, but mostly it is only notable for the breaks some of the songs provided.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I have to agree with everyone else here in saying that I was really looking forward to finally getting Beverly Hills 90210 the complete first season on dvd!!! Although Shannen Doherty left the show on a sour note, she was definately the breakout star during her reign as Brenda Walsh!!! I had forgotten how fantastic the first season was, considering I had'nt seen this show in many years, not even the butchered re-runs. Why bother when tv shows on dvd rule!!! <br /> <br />I decided to make my purchase in the store on the day of release, considering it came with the show's soundtrack and a five dollar gift card!!! My only complaint is the replaced music because the music sounds so generic. Perhaps I would'nt be so disappointed if I could truly understand why the studios have such difficulty in securing the rights of the original music. I suppose that's the hold up in releasing The Wonder Years on dvd. Thank goodness Universal released Miami Vice with it's original music, because Phil Collins' In the Air Tonight go hand in hand with Crockett and Tubbs riding in that awesome car on the open road!!!                     <br /> <br />Fortunately, the music from Beverly Hills 90210 was'nt that essential  and I'm just glad it finally got released on dvd, considering so many trash tv shows get released alot faster???
B000I5X80G|5.0|Live at The Fillmore East is a collection of six songs taken from two shows (March 6th & 7th, 1970) by Neil Young with the original Crazy Horse.  Danny Whitten was the band's lead guitarist and his interplay on these performances with Mr. Young is incredible.  The lengthy workouts \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" and \\"Down By The River\\" show how special the band was and are equally as sad for the lost potential.  The songs burn with an intensity and foreshadow the feedback laced work of future efforts like Rust Never Sleeps and Ragged Glory.
B000J103X4|2.0|<br />The good: Production is top notch for the most part, all west coast type beats i would buy the instrumental version <br /> <br />the bad: <br />             Games lyrics are horrendous, he is a biting, name dropping, crappy 'rapper' He sounds like Dre to a T in two or three songs, on Scream on Em, for some reason he sounds like Nas. Every song he name drops Dres name to a degree that is nausaitating. I've seen people say well its only Games style to name drop, thats not a style thats a gimmick. With that arguement you can say well its only Chingys style to be wack as hell. Game is a gimmick, yes the production is top notch, but the lyrics almost make this album unlistenable. I only listen to this driving in the car with the volume loud, when i'm not paying attention to the lyrics and just want to hear the production. <br />2.5 stars overall
B00005JPAJ|4.0|Chapter 11 of Genesis tells a story of mankind's attempt to reach heaven by building a tower, not as a way to glorify God but as a way for mankind to glorify themselves by putting them on God's level. God strikes the plan down by confusing/creating different languages so that the builders cannot understand each other thereby suspending communication. Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, along with his screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga's take on this material is \\"Babel\\" their third and most ambitiously produced film with locales in Morocco, Japan, San Diego and Mexico and like the Bible story, I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu is once again dealing with communication or lack thereof: how we talk and either no one listens or more to the point...doesn't understand. Simple themes told exceedingly well here.<br />In the best sequence, shot in Japan a deaf mute girl, Chieko (Rinko Cucuchi), desperate for attention and contact other than she can get from her pals, tells (actually signs) to her father (a sad sack Koji Yakusho from \\"Shall We Dance?\\"): \\"You Never Listen to Me!\\" Ironic on at least a couple of levels. Chieko is reeling from the normal drama of being a teen as well as the not so normal drama of having found her Mother dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She is also dealing with a father who is also devastated and unable to comfort himself much less his daughter. They live in a glacial glass high-rise box in Tokyo: a symbol of the icy coldness of the lives that they live within.<br />The two other parts of the film deal with the stars (a very good Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett) in Morocco on vacation (!?) and a supposed terrorist attack and the third, a very real and scary sequence involving the Pitt/Blanchett children and their caretaker, Amelia (a terrific Adriana Barraza) and their harrowing journey into Baja California.<br />Every one of I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu's films (\\"Amores Perros,\\" \\"21 Grams\\" and \\"Babel\\")  contain at least one gut-wrenching, emotional and transcendentally beautiful scene: the dog fight in \\"Amores Perros,\\" the Naomi Watts scene with Sean Penn in which she explains how it is to lose a family in a random accident in \\"21 Grams\\" and here in Babel: Chieko at a Shinto dance club, the soundtrack stopping and starting to approximate Chieko's experience, Chieko: wide-eyed, wide-eyed, mouth agape...experiencing a world in which feeling and touching is paramount and hearing isn't.<br />Though I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga stretch the \\"if a butterfly flutters its wings in Hawaii, etc.\\" metaphor to the breaking point, there is no doubt that<br />\\"Babel\\" has got the goods where it counts: deep in the recesses of its soul and heart.og fight in \\"Amores Perros,\\" the Naomi Watts scene with Sean Penn in which she explains how it is to lose a family in a random accident in \\"21 Grams\\" and here in Babel: Chieko at a Shinto dance club, the soundtrack stopping and starting to approximate Chieko's experience, Chieko: wide-eyed, wide-eyed, mouth agape...experiencing a world in which feeling and touching is paramount and hearing isn't.  Though Iñárritu and Arriaga stretch the \\"if a butterfly flutters its wings in Hawaii, etc.\\" metaphor to the breaking point, there is no doubt that  \\"Babel\\" has got the goods where it counts: deep in the recesses of its soul and heart.
B000002GKT|5.0|Fantastic 1971 live Humble Pie album,so good to have it on CD. We're in luck with this one, Frampton was still in the band. Tracks I remember playing the most off this disc were \\"Four Day Creep\\", \\"Stone Cold Fever\\", the Muddy Waters classic \\"Rollin' Stone\\" and the boot stomping \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\". Line-up: Steve Marriott (R.I.P.) - guitar, keyboards & vocals, Peter Frampton - guitar & vocals, Greg Ridley (also R.I.P.) - bass and Jerry Shirley - drums. Just all around great British blues rock. A must-have.
0743243153|5.0|The Road Less Traveled had an epiphany effect on my life, one of the first insights in spirituality beyond my religious upbringing. Peck says that life is confronting and solving problems which gives life meaning. He sites some case histories but the book is rich in philosophy addressing discipline, balance of accepting responsibility, and dedication to the truth in all areas of life. He explains depression as giving up something one loves. Love is not an erotic experience, but empathy and risks--a will, not a feeling. One's world view may be different than the religion he claims. Peck's most profound concept is about grace being a powerful force originating outside of human consciousness, which nurtures spiritual growth and guide us to godhead. <br />Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal, [...]

B000002GQK|4.0|A great come back album, from my perspective, although to more forgiving fans, there is no drop off in quality to any of the first six albums. <br /> <br />A bit more uneven than the earliest albums. Those albums are far more consistent, whereas here, there are equal parts incredible songs and not so strong songs. <br /> <br />\\"One More Time To Live\\" deserves more accolades as one of their all time top songs. Listen to it again today, and compare it to today's current events.
B000AP04FG|1.0|\\"Brangelina\\" shooting big guns at each other didn't do it for me, no matter how beautiful they (the stars or the guns) are.  My wife said it reminded her of \\"The War of the Roses\\" with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner, which I enjoyed.  Other than the very basic premise of hubby and wife trying to kill each other, I couldn't see much in common between that clever and entertaining film and this very predictable star and firepower vehicle.  Maybe it was intended as a date movie for dual markets--big guns for the guys and tabloid stars for the girls.  It's appeal escaped me.
B000002GQL|4.0|It would be six years before another Moody Blues Album would be released, which is one of several reasons the seven albums from Days Of Future Passed to Seventh Sojourn are treated as a separate body of work. There have been some great moments since 1978, but these seven albums, including Seventh Sojourn, are a cut above. <br /> <br />There are some great songs here \\"Lost In A Lost World\\" (hello \\"Lost\\" TV series! Buy the rights to this song. It's a natural.) \\"For My Lady\\" and \\"New Horizon\\" are all great. The original version of \\"Isn't Life Strange\\"-just incredible. \\"I'm Just A Singer In A Rock and Roll Band\\" is a great finale for this chapter in their career.
B000I5X80G|5.0|Neil Young and the original Crazy Horse were on fire during the Fillmore East set. The guitar playing don't get any better than is espically on \\"Down by the River\\" and \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\". Neil was cruise'in 100MPH with \\"Old Black.\\" Just listen to the middle of Cowgirl in the Sand, there is no equal to these versions. The other songs are great too, better than the album versions by a great deal. Danny's \\"Come on Baby Lets Go Downtown\\" is just a great song, with Neil's leads giving it alot of flavor. \\"Wonderin\\" a nice country-rock tune, with good backing vocals from Danny, rather short but very enjoyable. \\"Winterlong\\" great tune, guitar wise and vocally. This song is a way better than the decade version. \\"Everybody Knows this is Nowhere\\" is a great opener, gives a warm feeling of being home...the vocals are good as well. All the tracks are 10s...The album is something you can put on repeat and not get bored of.     Don't pass this up, if your a fan of Neil Young or not. If not, this will make you a Neil Young fan!     One of the best Neil Young live releases ever, it is short set, six songs, but those songs carry this release as Neil Young's masterpiece.
B00005S6K8|1.0|I don't know how this skunk got 4 and 1/2 stars on Amazon let alone one!  I could hear Hepburn, Bogart and Holden rolling over with a resounding boom.  I think this is mainly because of Ford's Linus.  He is a very unsympathetic character in this remake.  The film critics said that, while the original Sabrina was about her transformation, this version was about Linus' transformation.  But here Linus shows no transformation that you can really see.  His explanation to Sabrina for his deceitful romancing at the end- \\"There was a merger, and you were in the way.  No hard feelings\\" is very cold compared with Bogart's \\"Would you believe I enjoyed every minute of it?\\"  In the original, you get the feeling that Sabrina gets the right man; you don't get that here at all.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Three years after discovering the music of Damien Rice and I still get goosebumps everytime I hear him.  The first time I heard him was at Bonnaroo 2004.  As we stood in the tent with the rain pouring down around us, Damien and Lisa put on a show that can only be described as magical. The music just touches your soul.  It was then that I knew I had found something special. <br /> <br />I am in love with the song \\"9 Crimes.\\"  Elephant, Grey Room, and Accidental Babies are on repeat on my iTunes.   <br />I encourage anyone who is debating on buying this cd, it is worth it! Just turn the music up, close your eyes, and listen.  I mean really listen.  You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />And if you can ever see Damien Rice in concert, it will change your life.
B000I5X80G|2.0|I gotta say this is amazing stuff, but I wish it was the whole show or at least enough to fill a CD, 43 minutes is kinda a ripoff. It's no wonder the record industry is sinking. I feel like ripping it and returning it. But what I find really disappointing and confusing is, on Neils site it says this is a DVD release w/photo montage of the show and that it is the 1st release from the archive series, the cover says this is release #2 not #1 and is only audio CD not DVD!!! I don't see any other version for sale. So as amazing as this band is, overall I gotta say this is a slap in the face for all of us old time fans who have been waiting for years to get our hands on this!!! Come on Neil- Give us a little more bang for our ever shrinking buck!!!!
B0006GVJEE|4.0|Leon: The Professional is a great film. It is a fantastic action film that goes beyond that. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is not only sweet but real, and you have no choice but to care for these characters. <br />Gary Oldman is terrifi, as usual. Not only terrific, but terrifying. He is the ultimate bad guy. <br />The sets, the music, the performances, the effects, the direction... Leon is one of those few films in which everything seems to fit. <br />This DVD edition has a really good transfer. It is obviously the extended cut, which is far better than the US theatrical release. It is a two disc edition with some nice extras. Not as many as one would hope, but good ones anyway. <br />I would strongly recommend buying this Deluxe edition.

0140293469|4.0|Whining, 30's something, music obsessed, English guy can't get it together.  He searches in all the wrong places to blame everything in his life on someone else.  His character is so well written, he becomes annoying and there is a real need to hang in there with him to find out if he ever figures himself out.  Self centered, going nowhere, taking advantage of others seems to be his lot in life. Interesting presentation of how some men view the world, waste their lives, and those who are drawn to them.
B0001XAPY2|4.0|I liked this film a lot.  The big flaw in this release can be summarized in one word, Disney.    It was not the \\"name\\" American actors I found distracting, it was the lines the writers chose for the voiceovers.  In typical (current) Disney fashion, the script contains  colloquialisms that are so up to date, they are already dated.      The engineer character is also given superfluous, decidedly feminist lines that are absent in the Japanese version (if I may rely on subtitles for that evaluation).      On first viewing the Disney-dubbed English version, I noted that the Curtis character appeared to be a caricature of an American as seen through a Japanese (or Italian) person's eyes.  Comparing the Japanese version, I find that Disney injected a lot of explicit Ugly American into the Curtis character, having Curtis deriding the French language or shouting the ridiculous \\"here comes the American\\" (both absent in the Japanese version).  Curtis is plenty boastful and arrogant (and tall) in the Japanese version, and anyone but a small child would observe he's being portrayed in a certain way.  Disney did not help the presentation of this character by laying out his personality for consumption at the fourth grade reading level.  It is very typical of recent Disney to spell things out and ruin them, after the movie writer skillfully wove the same message into the script well enough that anyone over the age of 10 with a 90 or better IQ could figure it out.    On the plus side, everything said so far.  Porco's initial negotiations with the engineer are brilliant (English or Japanese), and the portrayals of motion and old mechanical airplanes make the movie intensely visually interesting.    I give the Japanese version a 5 and the Disney-English version a 3 (2.8 is more like it).  Luckily, this product contains both.  Split the difference and call it a 4.
B00005JPC7|5.0|\\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is an original and delightful film. Harold Crick is introduced, accompanied by narrative, as a boring, methodical IRS agent with his life structured around numbers and punctuality. The fun begins when he starts to hear the voice narrating his life and learns of his impending death. Out of desperation and with the help of a literary professor and a warm-hearted baker, Harold proceeds to change his life and discover the author guiding his destiny.     Will Ferrell as Harold leads the impressive cast in a subtle performance. Ferrell allows the humor to come from the situation of his character discovering he may be a fictional character and the absurdity of trying to be believed when telling others. He is given warmth and depth as he changes his life on a path to alter the destiny Karen has planned for him.    Emma Thompson plays Karen (sometimes called Kay) who is a depressed reclusive author with no lack of imagination when it comes to finding a way to kill her main character while her assistant, played by Queen Latifah, presses Karen to meet her deadline. Dustin Hoffman is delightful as the quirky literary professor who helps Harold on his journey to discover who he is and find Karen. And through Ana, a free-spirited baker he is sent to audit, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Harold learns to love and care about more than the numbers that fill all parts of his life.    The film's direction takes its queue from the unique twist of the script's plot, highlighting the difference in Harold's narrated life of numbers with the one he builds for himself as he takes control of his own destiny. The choices he makes on his journey to discover who he is give the film a rich and fulfilling life that had me laughing out loud.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Josh has outdone himself again this time.  I loved this CD because of the variety of songs he gave us that show talent.  The DVD shows how much effort he put into this CD and it shows.  My favorite songs are \\"Now or Never\\", \\"So She Dances\\", and \\"February Song\\".

0618551050|5.0|I have a PhD in theoretical physics so this can be regarded as an insider's review.  But before that I need to digress a bit...    The other day I was watching a re-run of the BBC \\"science\\" program \\"Parallel Universe\\" on TV and I found myself so furious about what's being shown that I shook my head repeatedly and even cursed at the TV more than a few times.  The reasons I was furious are:    1. The utterly shameless (to the point of immoral) promotion by string theorists (Kaku, Rendall and the usual suspects) of string theory as the Theory of Everything that explains everything (including the Big Bang!), despite the fact that string theory explains precisely NOTHING in REALITY (the \\"explanations\\" only work inside the fantasy worlds of string theorists).    2. The presentation of the outrageous fantasies and speculations of string theorists as scientific facts.  This is especially unforgivable, because a respectable media company like BBC has the responsibility to clearly distinguish between fact and speculation in their science programs.  It's like showing a science program on modern medicine and then interviewing witch doctors as though they're the authorities!    3. The air of superiority, arrogance and blindness displayed by string theorists, who seem to think that their utterly unproven (and unprovable) theory is absolutely correct and nothing can contradict it, not even reality itself.  And if reality doesn't seem to fit their mathematics (e.g. there is ZERO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE of 11 dimensions, branes, parallel universes and ANYTHING that string theory proposes), then reality must be wrong!  It is really amazing to me that these seemingly brilliant people (string theorists) have absolutely no intuition in physics, and only blindly followed their mathematics (and string guru's like Ed Witten), even though their mathematics is clearly leading them into dead-end after dead-end after dead-end. Mathematics alone should never be allowed to dictate the directions in theoretical physics.  We've seen time and again in the history of physics that when mathematics is allowed to dictate a theory without the checks and balances allowed by physical evidence and intuition, the result is always a dead end.  This is a lesson that must be learned.    That's why I'm very glad that this book by Smolin and Not Even Wrong by Woit finally came out.  I hope that these books can serve as wake-up calls that would finally lift the wool of mathematical fantasies and speculations that has been pulled over our eyes by string theory for the last 30 years.  We have already lost a whole generation of brilliant young physicists to string theory, something must be done now if theoretical physics is to save itself from self destruction in the hands of string theory.    I fully agree with Smolin that if we're to save theoretical physics, we need to nurture more \\"seers\\" (thinkers) in physics, who do not follow blindly the fads and fashions in physics, but instead try to examine the very foundation of the whole edifice of theoretical physics in the hope of discovering the physical principles and laws that have been overlooked by all other \\"craftspeople\\" (problem solvers) in physics.  Let's hope that such seers are already among us and that they will soon lead theoretical physics back to the proper path of discovery and progress, away from the dead-ends that string theory has led us.
B000J103X4|5.0|Okay I heard The Game's new album. Being a fan of his first album i was hoping that he came back hard. I had my doubts but he did not disappoint. Of course there are my favorites (Ol' English, Cal.Vacation, Doc Av, One Blood, Let's Ride, and Why you Hate Game) the rest are still good not the best but good.
B000IU3XTM|3.0|Damien Rice's previous CD \\"O\\" was one of those kinds of albums like Jeff Buckley's Grace where there was one amazingly awesome song but the rest of it was less interesting.  That one song, \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" (a.k.a. \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\"), made the whole thing worth it.  The problem with his new CD \\"9\\" is that it's like \\"O\\" without \\"Blower's Daughter.\\"  In other words, the new songs aren't that great.  There are a few things I like, such as the way the opener, \\"9 Crimes\\" begins with Lisa Hannigan singing before bringing Mr. Rice in.  The duets between Damien & Lisa are generally nice throughout the disc, especially \\"Grey Room.\\"  But overall and after a couple of listens, \\"9\\" still hasn't come to life for me.  A lot of slow-moving tunes where nothing much happens.  Perhaps my problem is just too many of these deadly serious singer-songwriter types with a folkish bent; the recent deluge of them from David Gray to James Blunt on the male side and Ani DiFranco et al on the female side.  Also, even those who gave this CD five stars will probably secretly admit that the CD's final track, which tacks on 15 minutes of ambient-style bell tones (and nothing else), is kind of annoying!
B0009MAO46|5.0|Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition)~ Tom Hanks is an amazing animated movie  with a well written script that is about the secret life of toys. The centers around Andy and his toys. Andy has a long time favorite toy named woody. Woody likes his situation till Andy gets a new toy named Buzz Lightyear and Woodys situation changes forever, or so it seems to Woody. The  animation is astounding considering that it was done over ten years ago (1995). I highly recommend this movie and I consider it one of the best animated made ever. The songs are a bit sappy but perfect for animated movies and the music is right on par. I definitely without a doubt give this movie 5 stars.

B000FS9FCG|4.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" is an interesting movie that won't allow you to remain indifferent. Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.<br /><br />The story begins in England, but not in the England we know. McTeigue's England is eerily similar to the country that Orwell's tells us about in \\"1984\\". There is a dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), that was chosen in free elections, but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler, exerting power without any kind of restriction. The citizens do nothing, they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide, and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think. Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.<br /><br />However someone is prepared to shake their certitude, and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be. That person is V (Hugo Weaving), a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens, and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago. Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman that V rescues from Sutler's minions, is a privileged spectator of V's plans, and the first person to become a fervent follower. That path, though, is not easy, as Evey's new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison.<br /><br />This is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects, for example whether the end validates the means, and the power of words. All the same, \\"V for Vendetta\\" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace. From my point of view, this film is simply a must see.<br /><br />Belen Alcat
B000056K04|5.0|This CD spurred publicity for the band due to the band acknowledging how they were taking their sound in a slightly different direction. Glenn Ballard(most famed for producing Alanis Morissette)was brought aboard as producer and helps the Dave Matthews Band evolve in both sound and style. The only overt difference here compared to past albums is the reduction in the extended arrangements and jams the band was so noted for in the studio. Ballard helps the band transform their music into more of a radio-friendly material with a polished pop sound-and it works magnificently. Everyday shows how the band can still play tight in the studio and their continued musical sharpness comes alive in all the tracks, while their songs remain spirited with words of wisdom and intellect. And they continue to sing about love and spirituality in the rare form that the Beatles did so perfectly all those years ago.
0156027321|5.0|The title says it all. I often compare this book to The Alchemist but Life of Pi has far more humor to it.
0060872675|3.0|I enjoyed this book immensely; however, I am a huge fan of discworld. Like others, I was also a tad disappointed that the illustrations of characters varied greatly from that of Paul Kidby. Many authors aren't given the option of picking their illustrator(s) and I wonder if this was the case with this particular book?<br /><br />I believe this book is geared more for parents who, like me, are discworld fans and plan to prep their children for reading the discworld series. The book functions primarily as an introduction to many characters found in discworld. I was disappointed in regards to this being a children's book. It serves no function for helping to teach your child....anything, really (unless it is to explain some words which may be a tad difficult for the recommended reading age to understand).<br /><br />As a collector's edition for an older kid or adult already familiar with Pratchett's work, I think it's a great book. I just don't recommend it for small children.
B00004RJ71|4.0|BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT (a.k.a. \\"Bound by Honor\\") is a bit of a surprise. While it incorporates many of the predictable elements of a barrio crime film, it is also just different enough to keep you hanging in there. For example, this film has the best location shots of East L.A. I think I've ever seen, and the whole movie has the look of authenticity. This is no illusion; the prison scenes were filmed in San Quentin, and there are only eight actors used for them.<br /><br />This adds interest as you try to spot the \\"real\\" actors behind bars. (Hint: The convict who looks like Billy Bob Thornton IS Billy Bob Thornton.) Another one of the non-cons is Hispanic poet Jimmy Santiago Baca; he plays the member of La Onda with a heavily pruned mustache. Baca co-wrote this screenplay, and it's clear that he's unaccustomed to the traditional story arcs of mainstream film. That's not to the project's detriment, but it does mean that you have to sit through the first half-hour of the movie before its promise starts to be revealed.<br /><br />In other words, this movie's bad acting and melodramatic music score are at their worst in the early going. Perhaps this is intentional; BLOOD IN, BLOOD OUT means it's hard to get in the gang, and it's not easy bailing from it either; the same is true for the viewer watching this movie. And just like joining a gang, you're making a real commitment here, as the film is well over three hours long. (In its original form, it was well over FIVE hours long!)<br /><br />SIDELIGHT: I've never heard \\"ese\\" (pronounced \\"ess-ay\\") so many times in my life; be sure to have the subtitles on to understand the Spanglish slang.
B000I5X81K|4.0|I had to listen to this CD several times to really appreciate it. I was first a bit dissapointed but then ...the WOW\\" factor kicked in when I realized the dynamics and theatrics of each song. I loved..LOVED the fading of his voice into the loudness of instruments playing \\"February Song\\". he creates a visual of him fading into the crazy world of a musical artist and how he was feeling. And again he takes you on a journey in \\"So She Dances\\". just listen to the dynamics within the song..he closes his eyes and invisions dancing in the spotlight with this beautiful lady. You hear a muffled hush with a slight wind blowing and the orchestration fades... just sooooo wonderful. Note on each of his songs how the music compliments his story telling through song. <br /> You know I have also met him and spent enough time to see the sincerity in his life... bravo Josh, Bravo... Yur Bonnie, Peggie Lee
B0009ZHJ7S|1.0|The best animated comedies are funny on two levels;  funny on the surface, for children, and funny at a deeper layer, for adults. \\"Shrek\\", for example,  was hilarious on both levels; fully for the littles, and hilarious even for us grownups.  <br /> <br />Alas, \\"Robots\\" has nothing for anyone over the age of, oh, eight. (Not having a young child handy, mine being away at college, I am unable to say how funny it might be for the littles.)  <br /> <br />DO NOT purchase this video expecting to be entertained yourself;  if you must, purchase this video and a book.  Your child can watch the movie, and you can read.
B000001EXR|4.0|If you were tired of the tight jungle suits and juvenile themes, this CD proved there was a band beneath the glam. This is easily their best songs since Creatures and makes me wish this incarnation of Kiss would come back. I never much cared for Singer or Kulick until this CD. This is really a great CD with power, emotion and great musicianship.
B000AARKOO|4.0|Kingdom of Heven has to be Ridley scotts best film since blade runner, and he's made some great films. This visually stunning epic follows balian, a metalsmith from france, as he finds out he is the son of a crusader knight. Balian travels to the holy land and has to fight not only the approaching islamic general Saladin, but also the war mongering, blood thirsty, fanatical christian crusaders. Mister Scott has done a fine job in the way this film treats the islamic warriors...with respect and humanity. in these times, this may be hard to do. It was rather unfortunate that this film was dismissed by most movie goers, as they truly missed an excellent film.  <br /> <br />I give it 4 stars because some of the relationships needed to be fleshed out more. Such as the relationship between balian and his wife before she commits suicide. and the relationship balian had with his father (Liam Neeson). I've yet to see the 3hr 10 min. 'directors cut'. I understand that some scenes and relationships are fleshed out more.
B000FILW86|4.0|Like I said I would, I finally got around to purchasing this CD. I especially like tracks 9-12. Cheap Trick is solid as always. I have been a long time fan and enjoy all their releases. If I do have any criticism at all, it is the fact that some songs sound like recycled Trick riffs. I guess it's hard to create new stuff after 30+ years. Anyway, there are some great tunes on this. Buy it like I did!
B0000004V2|5.0|Most people refer to this album as a synthethis of 60s rock with late 80s/early 90s dance. I'm inclined to disagree. My opinion is that this album merges 60s psych sensibilities with modern effects pedals to produce a trippy, jovial musical experience. \\"Elephant Stone,\\" \\"Shoot You Down\\" and most other tracks reveal this infatuation with guitar manipulation technology. The danceyness that's so frequently extolled in reviews is only occassional. The real magic lies in mixing the sound of '67 with the effects available in '89. <br /> <br />The technique of the band itself shouldn't be understimated, though. Ian Brown's aloof & cool approach cements the notion that this band is totally sure of itself and it's abilities. The rhythm section is top-notch, and occasionally, downright groovy. John Squire's guitar work is both a throwback to the days of tie-dye and a product of his time's technology. Mesh all of these elements and you've got a superb band playing superb music. <br /> <br />Oh, the music! The catchiest songs are interlaced with a fitting production that renders them dream-like (hence the trippyness). Absolutely  wonderful. Save for the brief \\"Elizabeth My Dear\\" and the backwards exercise of \\"Don't Stop,\\" each song is a rousing romp through a unique soundscape. The last two pieces are extended forays into a groovyness unseen since the 70s. Excellent. <br /> <br />A seminal release from the late 80s, the Stone Roses debut owes plenty to the psychedelia of the 60s but it also stands a testament to the talents of its creators.  <br /> <br />This is one of those \\"Must Have Albums\\" that you shouldn't do without.
B000J103X4|4.0|The Games new album Doctors Advocate is well produced  you figure it wouldnt have been because Dre didnt do one beat on this cd.  Although I would say it is well produced on  all levals I  wouldnt say that their is a  sole classic instrumental on this cd like there was a few on the last one obviously because Dre did some of the beats.  Album highlights would consist of Track 5 REMEDY this is a good  west coast track that youll love bumpin in the car. Track 11 Doctors Advocate he is in the studio drunk recording on the mic with Busta in this song and in this song he is talking about the beef with 50 and it is really a track for Dre to hear how Dre sided with 50 and that The Game says Dre was like a father to him its really a touching track to listen to because it sounds like everything out of the track is spoken from The Games Heart. Track 4 COMPTON is another real west coast beat and song good to bump in the car. Track 12 OL ENGLISH is a good song to listen to when  you are drunk and or high. Its got that drunk or high ring to it.  Track 3 It's Okay (One Blood) is the overplayed radio track of the album but I would'nt hate on this track like a would normally of a radio single becase it  really doesnt have that kind of girls, money, jewels, my white t, diamonds on my neck crap on it.   <br />I would say the downside of the cd would be the Track8 Wouldnt Get Far with Kanye  While the beat is fire  proally one of the better on the cd the lyrics are sub par especially Kanye , (p.s. he should stick to producing) kanye really kind of screws up and shot of this song being listenable.  And just for the overall album I feel The Game seems like he put a lot into the album but just not his all that is why I would give this album 4.5 stars instead of 5 he is almost at the level of making a realllly good album.  BUT until he puts his all into the album it will be around this level in ranking.  Overall if you are a fan of The Game or you like or liked The West Coast then this album is a must for you. The Game is the only one holding the west coast together and alive.   <br />Overall good but not classic material.
B000002LQR|5.0|Some people call this the apex of their career. I wouldn't be inclined to disagree. Their first three albums showed a band moving from lazy funk onto a more funk-rock sound. However, filler and low running times (a limitation of the vinyl era) made them good, but not overly satisfying listens. 1989's Mother's Milk had a producer-induced funk-metal muscle that some have scorned. I happened to like this machismo, but still, the album was short and had its share of weak, unecessary tracks. Then came this 1991 album. Wow, it could've been a double LP! What about the filler? Well, this thing is pretty darn consistent. Tracks roll on and on, yet nothing sounds forced or out of place. The funk is at its funkiest here, and Rick Rubin let's the band perform as they please. It's good and natural fun. Often its in your face. Sometimes its not. Either way, its a fantastic snapshop of the band at its incendiary peak. Later efforts, like the overly-metallic/somewhat-psychedelic/mellow/akward One Hot Minute and the three post-return-of-Frusciante albums all show a band that can't belt out the funk with the same reckless abandon shown here.<br /><br />Hightlights include: all those singles you know, plus \\"Mellowship Slinky in B Major,\\" \\"The Power of Equality,\\" \\"Funky Monks\\" and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy.\\"<br /><br />I'd suggest you immediately buy this if you simply enjoy music.
B00005JNQA|3.0|\\"The Interpreter\\" is intelligent, well intentioned, and stylish but unfortunately lacks an involving narrative and characters one truly cares about.  Maybe it's shallow of me, but I really think this movie needed a little more \\"punch\\" and good old entertainment value.  In the end, the film is watchable and interesting (and its dialogue about human rights issues is certainly honorable) but it could have been a lot more.  Fans of sterile, more intellectual thrillers will likely be more forgiving, but I personally like my thrillers to be more, well... thrilling.  The DVD features a crisp, clean widescreen image and generous extras that flesh out many of the issues discussed in the film.
B00001OH7V|4.0|Let's admit it: \\"Heroes\\" is one the best songs ever created, be it by Bowie or anyone else. <br /> <br />That said, this album isn't exactly a perfect one that totally compliment's the title track. The first two tracks are over-produced and noisy, and I say that in a bad way. The two tracks that follow Heroes are quite moody, and that's fine. \\"V-2 Shneider\\" is a bit a fun instrumental stuck in the middle of all this, so I guess I can't bash it in any manner. The next three instrumental are execellent exercises in ambiance. The last track, \\"The Secret Life of Arabia\\" could've been on Young Americans, except for the fact that it holds up better than a lot of the material on that particular album. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is kept from five-star status because the two tracks that begin the album just leave a bad taste in one's mouth. Also, when compared to Low, there's a certain clunkyness in the tracklisting on Heroes. Whereas the other album flowed well and had two distinct sides, Heroes just has a fractured structure. When all is said and done, however, this is still the album that boasts the track \\"Heroes,\\" and in all honesty, that makes it totally worth purchasing.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|As a college professor who teaches many of the scientific concepts explained by Gore in this film, I endorse the facts presented as accurate (although the implied connection between global warming and intensified hurricane activity is a bit premature as this is still under study).  In any event, I wholeheartedly recommend this film to others as a \\"must-see.\\"  While Gore is not a trained scientist, he has done a superb job of conveying the science related to global warming in a highly engaging manner that is easy to understand.      Don't miss this film.  Buy it, watch it, and get everyone you know to watch it.
B000002NJS|1.0|Not the highpoint of her career, I'll say that. Yeah, the title track is a great bit of 90's Hi-NRG techno. Catchy stuff. If you just want that track, buy the single and see if you can get some remixes of it too. <br /> <br />Sadly, this thing is an album. Albums are inhently prolonged affairs, and here, Madonna seems bent on putting forward a set of songs that ramble on for far longer than they should. I mean, none of these 13 songs are shorter than 4:10!!! Most tracks begin as a snoozy collage of synthesized dwaddling, with the eventual trip-hop beat sneaking up and suffocating the track with monotony. Some might have some uber-fast dancefloor throbbing, but a bout of four on the floor repetition does nothing to decrease monotony. <br /> <br />If you ever needed an excuse to hate 90s techno, well, listen to this album. Then again, listening to any 90s techno will automatically induce human beings to vomit in order to purge their systems of that foul guff. Ugh... <br /> <br />Highlights include: \\"Ray of Light,\\" and that's about it. <br /> <br />I'd suggest that you buy The Immaculate Collection and then pick few select singles (\\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Music,\\" \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" and \\"Hung Up\\"). That's pretty much all the Madonna you'll ever need.
B000J103X4|4.0|With the Game's second album he, as in the first ablum, carries his own wait. His lyrical ability has grown, while staying the same. The production is a great relationship with East and West. Moreover, the strengh's of the record are One Blood, Let's ride, Dr. Advocate, and Why you haten on the game. However, the game seems to be holding back and not allowing his strength to come forth. He mentions himself along the greats like Pac, Big, Jay, and Nas, but those guys could make a hit that crossed over into pop clubs. The Game has that same ability I can hear it in his words, but just like those greats it took their third albums to come out before that crossover happened.
B000002LJW|3.0|When I first got this album, I really wasn't expecting much. Clapton was never the bloke I turned to when I wanted to rock out. Upon the first listen, I concluded that Clapton cannot rock. He's too firmly rooted in the blues to really crank it out, and his later work consolidates this fidgetyness with a tendency to add an unecessary gloss to his work.    \\"Pretending\\" and \\"Bad Love\\" are the closest thing to 'rock' one finds on this album. Muffled wah-wah-ing takes place in front of a dated rhythm sequencer's noises. Elsewhere, the album incorporates the gaudiest 80s technology in the worst possible manner. It's like the cheesiest Miami Vice episode meeting sappy lyrics. But, to be fair, I'm fond of cheesy 80s machine music... it just doesn't gel too well with Clapton.    Some tracks are too bluesy for my tastes, while others try too hard (\\"Breaking Point\\"!).    In the end, I must admit that I don't hate the record. However, the mix of sounds doesn't coalesce into a nice whole. I suppose, however, that it's infinitely better than the Boys 2 Men rip off that was 1998's \\"Pilgrim.\\" Bleh.
B000I0QK74|5.0|This is a very good CD of Christmas music from James Taylor. Jingle Bells is my favorite track.  I've never heard this song performed in a blues style before, and it sounds very good.  Dave Grusin and Chris Botti lend their talents on the piano and trumpet respectively on the track Winter Wonderland.  They give this song an unique smooth sounding quality.  In The Bleak Midwinter is a new song to me.  I love the sincerity in James Taylor's voice.  Dave Grusin's piano playing is very good too.  The musicial arrangement on this track is beautiful. I like the duet entitled Baby It's  Cold Outside with Natalie Cole, because it sounds so romantic.  Go Tell It On The Mountain is an upbeat song.  This is the first time I've heard all the lyrics to this classic song, and I really like it.  James Taylor plays the guitar as well as he sings on the track River.  This is a song about missing a loved one at Christmas time. Auld Lang Syne is a beautiful track about the meaning and importance of friendship. James Taylor has always had the ability to touch people with his voice.  The music on this CD is proof of that. It is simply delightful.
B000003TAL|5.0|Fantastic. 70 minutes of sheer delight. There's great guitar work, but not in the Iommi-esque way I tend to dig, nor in the shredding style executed by messer Eddie Van Halen. Nope, this is rough and experimental, arty and rockin' at the same time. No, its not Roxy Music. No, its not the Buzzcocks. However, it is good fun. A rousing track will melt into feedback and noise, only to return later on. Or it may well just vanish into crackling obscurity. Either way, the whole thing is solid. There's a weird track in the form of \\"Providence,\\" but it's not lame in an \\"FX\\" (Sabbath) or \\"Mensforth Hill\\" way. It's just a slight detour, based on a piano riff, an amp and a recorded voice. Not bad at all. <br /> <br />Highlights include: \\"Teen Age Riot,\\" \\"Silver Rocket,\\" \\"The Sprawl,\\" \\"Total Trash\\" and \\"Trilogy: Eliminator Jr.\\"  <br /> <br />Stop reading slobbering reviews and buy this album. \\"Teen Age Riot\\" alone will probably provoke some drastic change in your life the first time you listen to it.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Robert S. McNamara is the consumate 20th century man. He is truly representative of his time. The interesting little homilies that he claims he has gleaned from his expereinces are universal and true. McNamara displays all the qualities that made him the most effective Secretary of Defense in the 20th century: articulate, thoughtful, a natural debater and very, very smart. Despite all the issues, McNamara says only what he want to, even stating that he never, never answers a question asked of him. Overall, this is an excellent documentary, it should be standard viewing for any American History course covering this period.
B00000I2UC|5.0|Let the indie snobs soil their pants as they get off to 1985's Psychocandy. That was a fine album, a thing of disturbing beauty that could captivate or make you hurl due to the sheer amounts of feedback. Fine. Now, could we look at another Jesus & Mary Chain album and not compare it to their debut? <br /> <br />On this 1989 album, one can actually hear the band. The mountains of screeching feedback have been largely subdued. In addition, the sound now boats a wily drum machine and a synthesized bass. Some have said that this album sounds like the Jesus & Mary Chain backed by ZZ Top, circa 83-85. Personally, I'd say this sounds like covers of Beach Boys songs, with overdriven Clash-like guitar work stapled over mid-80s Pet Shop Boys beats. You know that's a winning combination. <br /> <br />The album itself is one amazingly consistent listen. Each song is as thrilling as the last. The vocal delivery is actually distinguishable under these production values, and the edge that they add to the sound is marvellous. For my money, there are no weak tracks throughout most of the album. The only track that seems out of place is the second to last one. \\"Drop\\" is a rather uncharacteristcally chilled song, with acoustic guitars and a lone synth going along with the vocals. Things pick up with the closer, \\"Sunray,\\" with beats similar to PSB's \\"A Man Could Get Arrested\\" and a tinge of Psychocandy-esque feedback. Another fantastic album from 1989. <br /> <br />Highlights include: \\"UV Ray,\\" \\"Coast to Coast\\"... ah, heck, all the tracks have the same great dynamics about them! <br /> <br />I'd suggest that, if you run into this album, you fork over the dough needed for you to get acquainted with this work. Just remember: ZZ Top J&MC & PSB all rolled into one.
B0007PALZ2|3.0|The reviews seem to be generally quite favorable for this movie so I had no problems giving it a watch. Overall, it was solid but it left me a little wanting I guess.  Brad Pitts performance while cool at the beginning became very annoying after the 50th tantrum. This was character overkill.  Gilliam tends to do this so maybe I should have expected it?    Bruce Willis was good as was Madeline Stowe. Sometimes this film just plodded along though and didnt quite know what to do next. There were scenes that lasted a little too long and a few of the same types of scenes over and over. Perhaps the subject material wasnt as deep as I wanted. Basically it was a PETA wacko trying to kill everyone on the planet and Willis was sent back in time to try and come up with the original virus to make a cure in the future.  Thats all cool but when it all was unfolding I just wasnt as thrilled as I thought I'd be.  Dare I say the film became dull in parts and I was wondering when things would come together...???  They  barely ever did.    The film has been acclaimed very highly so obvious many people like it. I was a little under-whelmed with it but it is certainly worth a watch if you're into Sci-Fi. As to buying it, thats your choice.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|The songs on this album are all 3.5 star songs. They're executed in a better-than-average fashion, and that's it. The production values don't merit much praise, since they strip the variety out of the album. Most tracks, despite having inventive application of standard instruments, see musical innovation stifled by a studio-imposed uniformity. \\"Animal Bar\\" is still the most original track in terms of its execution. Overall, though, since the whole albums sounds so much alike and drags on for so long, I still give it a collective 3 star rating.
B000ICLRJ8|5.0|This film looks as though it was made with all good intentions. I really wanted to like and enjoy it. Because the character motivations were never deeply explored it lacked the essence of what could have made it a good old fashioned stand-up-and-cheer movie. It moved at a lethargic pace. If the character motivations were explored in depth, lethargy would have been replaced with viewer concern and interest and it would have been a much more entertaining film. Only the confrontation between Joaquim de Almeida as Admiral Piquet and Gene Hackman as Admiral Reigart gave this film some character based emotional fiber and substance that it sorely needed. I also thought this made the Hollywood theatrics at the end of the movie were just too unbelievable and out of place. Owen Wilson, Gene Hackman and David Keith do their best with what script they are given. Actualy Joaquim de Almeida, a very underated actor, came out the most memorable and believable.
B000065V1V|4.0|All in all, its not as uniform 1999's \\"...hours\\". That's good, though, since that release was utter junk. I found that one to be lacking in spirit, depth and gall. And Reeves Gabrels' guitar wankery doesn't help one bit. Neither does Bowie's forced vocal perfomance.     This 2002 album, however, is different. That loathsome guitarist is gone. The tracks alternate between comfortable classicism and contemporary techno-stabs at other people's songs. For the most part, it works. There's a complacent vitality to it that makes you feel as if Bowie and his crew are trying to intergrate old ideas into songs without sounding trite. It works, and the tunes are decidedly Bowie. Alas, there's nothing that really stands out too much.     Pre-\\"Let's Dance\\" Bowie it's not. Then again, it's a not a self-concious stab at modernity. In a way, it's a synthesis of all various approaches and routes taken in years past. It's not breaking new ground, but rather, it's the development of a certain niche sound. It's not trite, but the past looms large over this album. Overall, it's safe to say that this is a fine post-\\"Earthling\\" classicist effort.
0767817486|2.0|This movie is quite shocking by the near to complete freedom of prison guards to abuse and torture prisoners. It's probably even more shocking to the US public as an American is the victim as far as drug dealers may be called victims.  <br />People suspect of terrorism may due to the actions and regulations of the Bush government face a similar degree of dehumanization. This movie demonstrates the consequences if we allow governments to act as they want, freely and without controll. This concerns both George W. Bush as well as the former Turkey government. The sadistic prison guard could well have been Donald Rumsfeld talking about constructive techniques of interrogation.
B00001QGPR|1.0|Following the pop stylings of his lazy 80s material, the meandering rock wankery of Tin Machine and the forays into electronica that ended with \\"Earthling,\\" Bowie managed to churn out one last album in the 1990s. <br /> <br />Alas, the dreck he created was \\"hours...\\" <br /> <br />Truly, this is a marriage of many detrimental factors. First, Bowie's voice is remarkably off-key in most songs. The vocal delivery is of the dryest and weakest sort. He sounds pitifully old on these compositions, and the bite that was heard on several tracks off \\"Outside\\" is nowhere to be heard. <br /> <br />Second, the music itself is vacous and lacking. Melodies are weak, if not totally absent. The guitar work, unfortunately, is provided by that odious Reeves Gabriels character. A most disjointed and sloppy guitar slinger, his fretboard wankery only muddles already weak compositions. Thankfully, this is the last time his presence sullied up a Bowie album. Alas, his contributions to this work are painfully evident in tracks like \\"The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell,\\" which sounds like a banal stab at Iggy pastiche. Horrible. <br /> <br />Lastly, the production values on the album are terribly slick and overwrought. \\"Thursday's Child\\" sounds like a slow 90s R&B track with irksome smooth backing vocals. Other songs sound like Tin Machine compositions (*shudder*). Overall, the way in which the album was mixed really hampers weak material. <br /> <br />Sadly, the highlight of this album is the instrumental \\"Brilliant Adventure.\\" It sounds like it could've been on any of the Berlin-era albums. Everything else, however, sounds tired and of it's time. A bloody shame. <br /> <br />Thankfully, the 2000s saw Bowie release albums that, although they pale in comparison to past works, clearly make up for this petty, ill-conceived piece of work.
0060763280|5.0|I bought this Audio CD looking for that one NEW concept that changes the way I think about money/risk/living in general. I found many more than one, plus I've listened to it 3 times in the two days I had it, audio CDs are great for that! If your looking for business ideas or investment advice you're not really going to get it here. I did disagree with his comments on buying real estate at any means (as an investor, one should only buy real estate property at zero or positive cashflow or they should move on to the next property). A great real estate investment book the is Weekend Millionaire's Guide to Real Estate investing and the Mindset book (amazing books!). He talks about the MINDSET you have to have to take the ACTIONS despite of your FEARS. Futhermore, he elaborates on the following. Your THOUGHTS determine your FEELINGS and your feelings determine what you DO. DOING translates your desires, visualizations, etc... into reality. The biggest thing I got out of this book is the following warning: \\"I already know that\\" is what most people, especially poor people say in most aspects of their life and don't further educate themselves in a topic. Rich people are always learning and applying what they learn. If you have read 1000+ books on money, investing, whatever you want in life and you don't have the results you want its two things. One, you're MINDSET is not right for that task and you DON'T UNDERSTAND what those books were saying. If you did UNDERSTAND, you would be taking all the ACTIONS spelled out and like SCIENCE your life would reflect them (CAUSE and EFFECT). Notice how I said YOU and not blameing outter circumstances for your financial situation. Great book, Add to Cart!
B000001DYY|4.0|The first two TFF albums were masterpieces in their own right. One was heavily dependent on a theme, and the shorter follow-up was essentially a few great singles and two more tracks. Buy them both. The third album had \\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\" and is generally regarded as an example of elaborate, yet sometimes lovable, over-production.  <br /> <br />Then, the duo dissolved and one man carried on with the Tears for Fears moniker. This was the first album that resulted from the schism. For the most part, it continues with the TFF tradition of having great singles/potential singles along with more brooding tracks. Elements of the traditional Tears for Fears sound prevail, although the sound does change due to the departure of a key member and the early 90s setting. Overall, its not as strong as the first three albums due to the blandness of some tracks. However, the highlights of this affair do provoke the same reactions that the band could elicit back in it's heyday. <br /> <br />Highlights include: \\"Break it Down Again,\\" \\"Fish Out of Water,\\" \\"Elemental\\" and \\"Goodnight Song.\\" <br /> <br />I'd suggest you buy the first two albums and then maybe get this or The Seeds of Love later; Tears for Fears is best approached by taking in the brilliant early days and then accomodating oneself to the nature of their late-80s/early 90s work.
B000E0WJIC|2.0|I actually did buy this album hearing about how great these guys from Britain are. A friend let me borrow this album and I thought well this does have some good solos and riffs, solid double bass drumming and a good bass player. But the nasally vocals and emo screams quickly made this album boring quickly, the vocals were, lets say it was, \\"too radio friendly\\" to be a metal vocals, no growls and the clean vocals were not my cup of tea(and I hate tea). My advice for BFMV is if they want to make it in the metal world get a new singer and push the singer back into rhythm guitarrist unless they want to keep him and appeal to the emo kids instead. <br /> <br />Its still better than AV7, but who isn't.

B000E97X66|5.0|This was recorded without knowing that someday down the line, that this concert would become the breakout show putting Bruce and gang on the map in Europe.  Still touring from the Born to Run release, the band knew they had something good, but did not realize how powerful of an impression they would make by playing England.  Listen to this disk as if you were at the concert, seeing Bruce and the E Street band for the first time.  Truly chilling and one of the best concert recording I have ever heard.  This is a must for all Springsteen fans, even if you have heard the songs hundreds of times before. <br />

B0000640VM|4.0|The Charles Dickens book \\"Oliver Twist\\" was the inspiration for this book.  There have been many adaptations of \\"Oliver Twist,\\" and I found this one to be humorous and enjoyable.  The movie is a bit scary in some places, but otherwise should be suitable for most family members.<br /><br />Oliver (voice by Joseph Lawrence) is an abandoned kitten in New York City.  Oliver stumbles about until he encounters worldly dog Dodger (voiced by singer Billy Joel).  Dodger lives a carefree life with pals Tito (voiced by Cheech Marin), Einstein (voiced by Richard Mulligan), and other dogs.  Initially Oliver believes that Dodger's world is a good place to be, but all the stray dogs work with Fagin (voiced by Dom DeLuise), and Fagin owes Sykes (menacingly voiced by Robert Loggia) money.  Sykes has very affirmative methods of getting what he wants.  Those methods include effective application of violence.<br /><br />Jenny (voiced by Natalie Gregory) adopts Oliver and it seems as though Oliver's life is going to get better.  Unfortunately, Jenny's dog Georgette (voiced by Bette Midler) is not prepared to allow Oliver to take any attention away from her, so she plots to get Oliver out of the house.  Fagin captures Oliver and holds Oliver for ransom.  When Jenny shows up with her piggy bank, Sykes steps in and grabs Jenny, holding her for ransom from her wealthy parents.  The excitement is intense as we learn whether the dogs are able to defeat Sykes and return Jenny to her home.<br /><br />This movie is rated G, but there are some dark scenes in this movie.  I suggest the movie is suitable for most children down to the age of four or five years, but younger children may find some of the scenes disturbing or too intense.  Most other members of the family should find this movie fun to watch.<br /><br />This movie is kept from being too dark by a series of funny scenes.  There are also songs and dancing.  This movie shares some similarities to \\"The Lady and the Tramp.\\"  If you enjoyed that movie, you should enjoy this one.  This movie is a favorite of younger children, and most adults should find it interesting as well.<br /><br />Enjoy!njoyed that movie, you should enjoy this one.

B000J103X4|4.0|New York Times ain't exactly the reference when it comes to Hip Hop, but the doctor's advocate is indeed one of if not the best hip hop album of 2006 so far. Everybody knows the boy can spit. Everybody knows he also loves the attention and doesn't shy away from beef. Regardless, whether or not you like his antics, you cannot listen to this album and not bump your head to it.<br />The track selection is great, very good production, The game talks a lot about Dre ( even got a track dedicated to him ) and though the legendary producer is M.I.A, the whole album's got that West Coast vibe reminiscent of that good old G-Funk era.<br />\\"Compton\\", \\"One Night\\", \\"California Vacation\\" are instant bangers, and that last track with Nas is a classic. A lot of G-UNIT kids act like $.50 made The Game, if it is so then let $.50 make another one, and negro please, Spyda Loc is nowhere near The Game's caliber.<br />The only thing I wasn't too hot about was Game's delivery. He does change over the tracks, on some he sounds like a bit like Dre, on another one he sounds like Nas, but either way, even when he doesn't sound like himself, he's still among those stars.<br />Ain't much else to say, the music speaks for itself.
0373771665|3.0|I somehow found the two main characters lacking.  The heroine is simply too perfect for my tastes!  Also, she always seem to be in a joyous mood.  Too much sunniness gets to my nerves.  Also, I really didn't get a feel of the hero.  I felt like he was under-written.  The most entertainment I had from the book was from the nurse, the horrible mother-in-law, and the brother!
B00014K5TQ|4.0|If you expect to watch a plot driven movie,this is not for you. This film uses a murder to draw you into the time of the Club Kids, a time when it only mattered if you were seen.<br /><br />I sat down to watch this out of boredom. I am not a fan of Macaulay Culkin and did not think I would last the entire film. Instead, after writing this review, I will be watching Party Monster again.<br /><br />This film is almost as much about the time as it is about the people. Michael Alig and James St. James happened to be the people who took us to the late 80s, early 90's pre-Giuliani New York night club scene in this film. My exposure to the Club Kids prior to viewing this film was limited. I had managed to see them on Joan Rivers and thought what they were doing was a cool idea, just living to be seen, in a sense. The young men and women were existing for the next party, the next person to give them attention and the next high (both natural and chemically induced).<br /><br />This movie transports you to a time and place that most of us will never experience, and it manages to do it quite well. The beginning and end did not fit in with the rest of the film and the attempt to bookend the film did not quite work out well, although the end did tie in reminder that Alig only cares for attention in case we had forgotten what his driving force is. I still found these scenes to be tacked on. They did help me travel from now back to the time period of the film and back again but it still seemed a bit disjointed.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this film is low budget. This was especially obvious in a couple of scenes that take place outside the club on the street. I could almost see the tape for the roped off area, the lack of natural foot traffic was obvious. The two main actors (Seth Green and Culkin) both had several scenes where it was clear they had not had time to work on practicing their lines, and that rehearsals were needed (the beginning of the first scene in the fast food joint comes to mind).<br /><br />I was surprised at the performances by Chloë Sevigny (yes, gay men can have friends that are girls), Dylan McDermott (who played an excellent role in Wonderland -- another low budget gem, around the same time) and Marilyn Manson as Christina.<br /><br />This is a good movie to view if you want to leave the world you are in for a couple hours, but a better budget would have really helped this film.food joint comes to mind). <br /> <br />I was surprised at the performances by Chloë Sevigny (yes, gay men can have friends that are girls), Dylan McDermott (who played an excellent role in Wonderland -- another low budget gem, around the same time) and Marilyn Manson as Christina. <br /> <br />This is a good movie to view if you want to leave the world you are in for a couple hours, but a better budget would have really helped this film.
B000000OU0|4.0|I had heard this version of Hotel California before and bought the CD specifically for that song.  Fortunately, all the others are pretty good too.  The quality of the recording is very good - more like a studio recording than live (except for the crowd noise at beginning and end of each track).
B000I5X80G|2.0|Hyped in his biography \\"Shakey\\" by Jimmy McDonough, discussed countless times in interviews in music magazines by Neil himself and others close to him, the \\"Archive Project\\" and associated releases is music many fans of Neil's have waited for for many years.    The wait is over and the verdict is? Two stars. Why? The band is great. Recorded before \\"After The Goldrush\\" and before \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" it is Neil and Crazy Horse at their electric finest.     Unfortunately, the music is easily accessible to most music traders, it is not a complete show (it's 40 minutes of music) the CD inserts don't remotely compare to the information the Dick's Picks series or Dylan Bootleg Series liner notes has and the cost is excessive.    This is not for the Neil Young fan who likes Harvest. This is for someone who loves \\"Everybody Knows\\" and doesn't mind being gyped on length, insert materials or value.     Speculation has gone on for years as to how many discs the first release would be and what it would cover. I'd venture to guess no one guessed 40 minutes of a show you can easily trade for on the Internet.    I wonder if Reprise had more to do with the release than Neil's camp?     If not? This Note's for YOU, Neil.     You could have easily picked a quality (acoustic) show like Massey Hall in Toronto from 71 and pleased many more fans.
0743201140|5.0|I found this book to be so helpful that I ordered 20 copies for my team.
0618680004|4.0|I come to a book like this with a fair share of baggage, and feel as though it is written just for me. I was surprised by, but not sure if I was happy about, the simple language Dawkins uses in the beginning chapters of the book, as he asks the reader to examine where their beliefs came from, and differenciates between a child raised in a parent's religion, and a religious child.    I was not a religious child, but I was once a zealously religious person, seeking to conform myself into a religious mindset in order to have a place to discuss the abstract concepts and so-called \\"transcendent\\" experiences I find myself very interested in. Brain research is revealing so much about these things, and I'm especially attuned to that.     But to the point,  To be taught that if you don't believe, you are just supposed to believe that you believe, is damaging to the very intellectual capacity you are born into the world with. It is all so convoluted, but I disctinctly remember learning to shut down all questions in order to be \\"faithful.\\"     This now seems to me so antagonistic to the creative/intellectual process that I'm embarrassed by it, but thankful at the same time. I have a rather unique perspective, having examined my thinking from within and without, and now find myself able to simultaneously think along and understand incredibly and fundamentally different ways of thinking, with curiosity and distance rather than emotion.   Because of that,  I had a great deal of fun reading this book, and am thrilled for the discussion.     One of the things that began to chip away at my religious determination, was the political invasion into the churches I attended. Even as I determined to \\"follow Jesus with all my heart,\\" I felt personally affronted when political speakers were brought in to tell me how God wanted me to vote.     I began to see that my idealism had imposed a vision onto the religious institution I was attending, of what I desperately wanted. I had been trying to create my own Utopia. When tested however, it wasn't actually real. I found myself amazed by my own imagination, and consequently by  imagination and the process of learning in general.    Dawkins is right. Society can be a lonely place for athiests, and for those of us who are just \\"questioners\\" too. I believe what Carl Sagan said though, that scientists are the true worshipers. They face the questions and \\"creation\\" with all  intricasies, and believe that more and more will be revealed. There is a fearlessness to good science that goes away when we shut down questions by using God, simultaneously asserting that God can't be questioned.    -Stephanie
B000IU3XU6|4.0|Although I do not find this as spectacular as Closer, I still enjoy this CD very much.

0767817478|2.0|And yet, I can't seem to really hate this 'Godzilla'. Hell, if we were to rate the flick based merely on Godzilla's aesthetic, I'd give it at least four stars. Can you tell I've never cared [enough to venture into] the original Godzilla films? I seem to be one of the only ones who genuinely thinks Godzilla's new look and movement is quite awesome; so much of the hate I've read regarding this issue seems to come from an attachment to the original design, laid way in the East many years ago. 'Guess that works in my favor as far as \\"opening up\\" to this film........ if that's a good thing.    The first half of the film is watchable, the second half isn't, by and large. As soon as they hit the baby Godzilla's in the stadium, it goes from decent to absolutely horrendous. At that point, it becomes so uncommonly absurd you can't help but wonder how they actually made it through filming the entire set piece without succumbing to their own criticisms. Same goes for most everything that follows.    Personally, though, I found one good reason to watch this version of 'Godzilla' was for a mere demonstration of the visual effects, and how they rank along the timeline with regards to the subject of CGI in cinema. Far as I recall, I remember walking out of the theater when first seeing 'Godzilla' in 1998 and being pretty astonished, thinking that they were near perfect, and topped only by 1997's 'Starship Troopers'. It was actually pretty staggering, then, when Godzilla started to rampage through NYC as I watched this DVD the other day, because in that whole event inparticular, the CGI just doesn't hold up at all. It's interesting to note that, after witnessing this, the film from that point on lets Godzilla out of his cage only at night; it seems that they're able to work much better with the lighting in this respect, and the result is some beautiful, stunning shots courtesy great cinematography and stellar CGI rendering. Still, though, the CGI is strangely inconsistent; some wellcrafted and inspired (Godzilla averting nuclear submarines; Godzilla getting entangled amongst the Brooklyn Bridge), while some is so bad I couldn't help but focus on it throughout its appearance (virtually all of the baby Godzilla renderings). Frustrating. I will say though that the technical virtue of 'Godzilla', when its in its own little zone, is near unmatched, and Devlin and Emmerich prove -- as they had before with 'Independence Day' and since with 'The Day After Tomorrow' (abominable flick) -- that they can compose some outrageously scoped action with great prowess.    Problem is amongst these visual flairs comes absolutely no substance. There's no story here. The characters are asinine. Literally none of the comedy plays out. There is one scene, actually, which I find absolutely hysterical, involving Jean Reno and his crew, whom are trying to disguise themselves as Americans in Army uniforms. Reno's particular expressions and nuances are just priceless, and there's no real way I could translate that to words. Anyway, that aside, it's just pathetic. I mean, you've got like four brilliant actors from 'The Simpsons' (Hank Azaria the only one getting any real screen time), and you can't produce a laugh? You've got problems.     I really don't mind this film up to its mid-way point. I don't. And yet, it's strange, because I think the reason I do hold 'Godzilla' somewhat closely is the overall detached feel it brings with it, not to mention a pretty confused identity. But it's got that little theme... you know -- Humans create huge monster with their own actions (in this case nuclear workings), then must destroy the monster to ensure their own survival. Sure we've all seen it before, but whatever, it usually affects me a respectable amount, and on my viewing of this 'Godzilla' almost a decade after I first saw it, I still found myself moved when the magnificent creature desperately roars, trapped helpless as our militant jets are swooping down with their lovingmissiles. It's bizarre, because not only does the film never consciously focus on this fatalistic theme, it acknowledges it with but a line or two from Broderick, telling the Army that Godzilla's just an animal, who's intent is far from destroying Humanity. Yet, because there is absolutely no drive or motivation from any of the characters in the film, and we're mostly just watching Godzilla run away in fear from Human weaponry, I don't know how there's any way else to feel by the end but saddened. It's not art, but it's still a tragedy, if you connect the dots. Well, at least I sympathized.    And yet, the last three minutes of the film, after Godzilla's eyes have gone dim, provide closure to stupid characters courtesy inept resolutions and a heroic fanfare by composer David Arnold (who's score is still phenomenal all around). The mood of this is supposed to be bright, hopeful, optimistic, but I just find it angering. It's this kind of schlock that overrides the potentially dark, dramatic elements of the film buried beneath its surface; the kind of schlock that nightmares are made of -- Maria Pitillo doing a Joan Cusack impersonation.

B000I5X80G|5.0|This album is amazing, if your a Neil Young fan AND you like Crazy Horse. If you don't care for Crazy Horse rock or your new to Neil, then go buy Harvest or the Greatest Hits package. This album has some ridiculous guitar work on it, and anyone who think that Neil Young is not one of the top ten guitarists of all time might think differently after hearing Cowgirl in the Sand. I personally am more of a fan of the acoustic Neil Young, but this album was just too tempting to pass up.  All in all, I think this is a pretty awesome release. I am not upset that they didn't include Cinnamon Girl on this album, because frankly I think that song is overrated. This album would've been right up there with Live Rust had the acoustic part of the show been included, but I trust Neil Young's judgment; farther down the road there will be an acoustic live album that will probably be mind-blowing. And for all of you complaining about the lack of tracks on the CD, don't buy it. You can tell  how many songs are on an album before you purchase it. Neil Young is a very picky man, and this is what he wanted. Be happy he gave us this!
B000J103X4|2.0|Game comes across as the irritating little brother that brags about his older brother's accomplishments and attempts to get a rep and live off his name, instead of making his own mark on his own. This guy even jacks Dre's voice and flow on more than one joint. Not good.    Other negatives are:  The album cover looks like he's taking a dump.    Game's constant biting of lyrics from Jay, Cube, Pac, Snoop, etc. Too many to count. The name dropping thing is retarded.    Just Blaze's second steal from Nation of Millions, Remedy. Kind of reminds me of the Westside joint from the first album.    Kanye's: Would'nt Get Far is a bite off Jadakiss \\"By Your Side\\" off his 2004 album.    Will somebody please put out a well rounded West Coast hiphop album. Dig deep and consult with West Coast legends such as Above the Law, DJ Quik, E-40, The DOC, MC Ren, Tone Loc, Richie Rich, Dogg Pound, Westside Connection, Cube, Yo Yo, Ice T, Cypress Hill, Heiro Crew, Michele, King T, Digital Underground, Kam, Paris, Dru Down, CMW, The Luniz, Lady of Rage, Hammer,The Liks, Suga Free, 2nd to None and others.    This is not the best that the West Coast has to offer and I have classic records from the late 80's till 1996 to prove it!
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I have to admit.  I was one of those viewers asking \\"who was that guy?\\" on Ally McBeal.  Yes, it was Josh Groban.  However, I became a huge fan with Closer.  Now, with Awake, \\"huge fan\\" has been elevated to a whole new level. <br /> <br />As usual, Josh's voice is beyond belief (he has matured vocally so much since his first cd), and the music will touch your soul.  But take this compilation even one step further.  Listen, and I mean really \\"listen\\" to the lyrics.  If you were ever in love, ever had your heart broken or ever needed hope, you will find a home with this cd.  Josh lets you believe each and every song. <br /> <br />The song \\"Awake\\" on the special edition that Josh wrote for his parents could have been written for any parent by any child who knows what unconditional love is.  As a parent, this song hits home because we spend out lives raising our children to BE independent, knowing that one day, they will have to \\"leave the nest\\" -- and as parents, this is bittersweet.  This song brings it home. <br /> <br />I could go on about each and every song on this cd, but will stop with this one.  I encourage you to go on this journey with Josh.  I know I'm glad I did.

B00005JMYI|5.0|At last, a comedy that has the right combination of ingredients: good writing, inspired improv, great acting from the entire cast and just the right blend of absurdity, cerebral wit, slapstick humour and 'cutesy' appeal. Will Ferrell leads the new generation of comedy stars in this goofball 'story' about the trials and tribulations of San Diego's top TV anchorman, Ron Burgundy and his trio of screwy sidekicks (played absolutely brilliantly by Paul Rudd, David Koechener and Steve Carell). Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller, Jack Black and even Tim Robbins provide support with inspired cameo performances. Even the talking dog, a dubious concept at the best of times, works without inducing a vom-a-thon.  The casting is inspired: Christina Applegate brings her sympathetic screen presence to the role as ambitious anchorlady and love interest Veronica Corningstone, while Fred Willard (who has impeccable timing) is a blast as Ed Harkin the station boss. In fact there are no weak points to speak of, just several standout moments: Ron breaking down in a telephone booth is a classic, as is Veronica throwing a typewriter at his head.<br /><br />Even the music is spot on: the wonderfully corny 70s classic Afternoon Delight makes a welcome screen comeback and puts the icing on the cake. Superb.

0743289412|5.0|As a King fan for 20 years, I wasn't sure what to expect with Lisey's Story. The cover made it look like some kind of a romance novel - at least until you understand a few details. I did not find it to be a \\"love story\\" as others have. I guess it could be considered that, but it wasn't in my mind or I wouldn't have read it. The \\"smucking\\" language did not bother me at all, I actually liked it. King is right on with the ways some characters talk, and I thought it was a nice touch. I think the meat of the story is a woman who has conveniently \\"forgotten\\" some minor incidents that turn into a major life changing series of events. King has done a fine job with this novel, and although it is much different that anything he has published, I thought it was an excellent piece of writing.
B000002LND|5.0|I remember back when advertisements for Madonna's Immaculate Collection were posted all over music stores and there was even the occasional commercial on MTV and VH-1 and I was thinking to myself.. I HAVE TO HAVE IT!  Being a die- hard Madonna fan before I was even in Kindergarten (my first single was Borderline on 45) I considered this release to be the culmination of Madonna's career. I was excited to finally have a greatest hits package of my idol, but at the same time, I was slightly on edge, with the majority of pop music being considered disposable, once an artist compiles a greatest hits package, this is USUALLY a sign of the beginning of the end... I was so hoping this was not the case for Madonna, and boy was I right!  Borderline was the very first song I was able to really associate Madonna with at such an early age when it was released. It was until after my mother felt I was old enough to own a full-length album that I was able to put a name and face with the hit Holiday! What a pleasant surprise that was!  <br />     I remember in the months preceeding November of 1990, the local radio stations began playing the remixed and re-mastered tracks from Immaculate, and always having been a fan of Madonna's 12 inch singles, I was amazed and blown away by the arrangements and remixing of her now classic tracks.  I remember hearing Vogue(my all-time fav maddy track) on the radio and hearing how it was slightly exteneded and remixed. I had chills sent up my spine. At this same time, Madonna was finishing up her Blonde Ambition World Tour and her record company was pushing Madonna Mania like crazy.  The Immaculate Collection gets released in then state-of-the art Q-Sound Technology, Justyfy My Love hits the airwaves and it's video stirs up controversy, then to top it all off, The Immaculate Collection gets a video release and then, the icing on the cake.. Madonna's first ever boxed set.. The Royal Box - featuring Madonna's Immaculate Collection on either cassetteor a limited edition picture disc cd enclosed in a satin cd cover, a copy of the immaculate collection on VHS, a set of 5 postcards featuring the famous photo shoot done by Herb Ritts for the Immacualte Collection liner notes, and a poster of Madonna in her Marie Antoinette guise that was made famous during her 1990 MTV music awards performance of Vogue.   <br />    I remember telling my mother all of November and December, if anything and most of all, I wanted The Immaculate Collection and Lisa Stanfields \\"Affection\\" cd's for Christmas.  I got exactly what I wanted.. of course she held those presents for last, but I got them! Remember when cd's used to come in those fantastic, but wasteful long boxes? I ran straight to my bedroom and would remain there for months to come with this cd blaring. There was more to come that Christmas, granny bought me the Royal Box, cd edition, and after the holidays, a local record shop was having a MAJOR clearance sale and they had cassette edtions of the Royal Box marked down to $7.99..yes.. $8.00!!!  WOO-HOO!!  Recently, I just found a sealed copy of The Immaculate Collection on double LP at Tower Records.  Needless to say this has been and will always be my favorite Madonna album, followed closely by 2006's Confessions on a Dancefloor and Ray of Light.   <br />      The sound quality of each of these tracks is amazing. Beginning with light, but danceable \\"Holiday\\" and finishing with the danceable house workings of Vogue, this collection compliles most of Madonnas greatest works and finishes with two, and at the time, new tracks \\"Justify My Love\\" and Rescue Me.  <br />  Hearing most of these songs for the first time on cd when I recieved my copy was amazing. I was hearing things in these songs that I was unable to detect on vinyl or cassette.  Listening to these tracks takes me back to my childhood. This will be one album that will forever remain in my collection and it should yours too.  <br />

B000HEWEEY|4.0|I first saw much of this film, but not all of it, when it first came out. I was at a special appearance by a local TV figure who had a daily show directed at very young children. His name was Captain Satellite and he was appearing live at the local theater downtown. So I went to see him, and they showed this movie. I was 4 years old. <br /> <br />I was OK, but apprehensive, until the scene when the invisible monster enters the spacecraft, and you can see the steps bending under the monster's weight. The next thing I knew I was in hysterics in the lobby, and an usher and my mother were trying to calm me down. It was such a potent nightmare for a young child. I finally went back in to the theater, but my mother sat with me, and held her hands over my eyes when I asked her to. I didn't see much of the attack on the spacecraft when the monster tries to come through the force field, but I sure heard it. <br /> <br />I finally saw this again on TV in my teens, and I loved it. It is such an unusual piece of work that much if it gets right past the filters we install to protect us from whatever frightens us in the movies and goes straight for the id, if you know what I mean. <br /> <br />What keeps it from being a five star movie is the somewhat hokey, tired humor associated with the cook and Robby, and Anne Francis's limitations as an actress. <br /> <br />Walter Pidgeon is a wonder. His inner struggle to protect his daughter becomes the crux of the film and the energy that drives the monster on the loose. <br /> <br />There is something so wonderfully eerie about the entire production design. Some of the spookiest, unnerving scenes take place when the crew is being escorted through the subterannean machinery built by the previous inhabitants of the planet. <br /> <br />And the music. Wow. There has never been anything like it since. The electronic score was very much in the style of pieces being pioneered by artists such as Morton Subotnik during this era. This, most of all in the film, is what gets under your skin, disarms you, and leaves you open to the powerful images and themes that the film conveys. <br /> <br />This is a must see for anyone who is any kind of sci-fi fan. I think it would rank high on the list of any fan of fantasy or horror in cinema as well. As for being scared, I was never scared so badly at a film again until I saw Alien. I think that is another film that owes a debt to Forbidden Planet.
B000J103X4|5.0|I wasn't even prepared to realize how hot this album was going to be.  I mean, I knew it was going to be hot, but daaaaaaaaaa*n!!  Instant classic!  These tracks sound like they just came out of Dr Dre's Chronic album.  I thought the Documentary was good, but not a classic.  I noticed that Game was getting better and better in every mixtape following that album, in which he buried G-Unit with the classic diss mixtape \\"Stop Snitchin, Stop Lying\\". Then we come to this album, in which Game has mastered his craft and created a 5 star classic.  His flow is reminiscent to Dr Dre of 92.  Some reviewers are saying he's biting.  Honestly, I thought it was Dre as soon as the first track started, but how is that a bad thing?  Look, not even Dr Dre has spitted this hard since the NWA/Chronic days so why is everyone hating?  This is the first straight up West Coast classic since Dre's Chronic 2001.  It's almost like Game is bringing back G-Funk.  To me, the Documentary had more of an East Coast sound, which I felt took a little away from it considering Game is from Compton.  I was expecting to hear somebody who brought the same energy and style as classic NWA.  Now with this album, Game has brought it back full circle.  To top it off, for those fans who loved the Documentary, Game has a guest appearance from East Coast legend Nas in the closing of the album.  Game and Nas sound like they've been rapping together for years.  It just shows how Game can be so versatile. To further see how Game can adapt to any style, check out the mixtapes \\"You Know What it is Vol 3\\", \\"Ghost Unit\\" , and the aforementioned \\"Stop Snitching, Stop Lying\\".  Those mixtapes turned me into a true fan.  Anyway, If you've been missing the classic sounds that came from the West Coast back in the 90s like the Chronic, Doggystyle, Doggfood, etc, do yourself a favor and buy this album.

B000J103X4|3.0|I've become pretty sick of mainstream hiphop over the past few years; I can't think of even one \\"lil\\" or \\"young\\" that I want to listen to.  And the South having taken over the rap industry is, to me, like the \\"Golden Girls\\" taking over the Porn Industry.  So when \\"The Documentary\\" dropped a couple of years ago and I purchased it, popped it into my CD player and listened to it, I found it to be like taking in a breath of fresh air after stepping out of port-a-potty at the carnival.  In fact, The Game is the only new mainstream MC since Eminem that I've been a fan of.  To me, \\"The Documentary\\" stands up with \\"The Marshall Mathers LP\\", \\"The Blueprint\\" and \\"Stillmatic\\" as one of the best hiphop albums of the past five years.  So needless to say my expectations for \\"The Doctor's Advocate\\" were pretty high.      Like most other Game fans, when I heard there would not be a single solitary Dre-produced track I was disappointed and a little worried.  However, you can rest assured that Hi-tek, will-i-am and Scott Storch do a more than satisfactory job turning \\"The Doctors Advocate\\" into what is probably the best Produced album since \\"The Documentary\\".  However, although Dre's beats aren't particularly missed, his mentoring is.      That is, the problem with this album isn't the production, it's \\"The Game.\\"  Many people have stated in previous reviews that he has improved his delivery.  Huh?  His rhyme-structuring is weak, he goes off beat on numerous occasions and there's a lot more punch-ins than there were on \\"The Documentary\\".  And, on at least three tracks, he sounds like Dre.  And when I say \\"sounds like Dre\\", I don't mean a little bit, kinda/sorta.  I mean it sounds like Dre died, Game bought a Ouija board which he used to conjure up Dre's spirit, he then allowed that spirit to possess him and proceeded to rap.  Lackluster delivery and Dre mimicry could be forgiven in light of rich/deep content; but unfortunately a lot of verses on this LP are as hollow as the shells ona compton street after a nighttime drive-by.  Virtually every verse is westcoast this, dre that, 'pac this, 6-4 that.  Alright, alright, we get it.  You love westcoast gangster rap, dre is your idol, you wish you were one of Eazy-E's 10 illegitamate children.  There's nothing wrong with being proud of your roots, or giving credit where credit is due, but there IS something wrong with an entire album devoted to the aforementioned especially when it was already acclomplished on the previous album.  Granted, the tracks \\"Why you hate the game\\" and \\"doctors advocate\\" feel deep, fresh and like they were made by a top-tier rap artist.  But 2 tracks don't make an album.  That's not to say that all the other tracks are garbage; they're not.  \\"Old English\\" is good, as is \\"One Night\\", and in fact I can't think of one song on the entire album that is flat-out wack.  But I expect, and even demand, a higher caliber of music from the man responsible for \\"The Documentary\\"; especially since he's consistently touting himself as the best rapper alive, the king of the west coast, the maker of a 5-mic classic LP etc.  Don't tell me you're dope, don't rap about how you're the king--BE dope, BE the king.  You make the music, I'll make the judgments about the music.    When all is said and done, this album is not what hard-core Game fans said it would be, nor is it what hard-core G-Unit fans said it would be.  That is to say, it's not a classic, 5-mic, XXL album; nor is it a garbage, trash, flop of an LP.  It's better than any mainstream rap album that's come out this year, but it's certainly not a crowning achievment. And it's best-mainstream-rap-album-of-the-year-so-far status (which is due in large part to it's production) is likely to be revoked in the not so distant future since new albums are headed our way from Jay-z, Clipse, and Nas.  If The Game hopes to remain King (or be crowned King depending on your opinion of him) of the West Coast and especially of hiphop in general, then he needs to quit talking about his greatness, the greatness others, and start truly embodying and emanating greatness on every track he's a part of.  The Sun doesn't have to tell me it's bright, I can see it!
B000IOM1RI|5.0|Tenacious D Rocks and we all know that but the one problem i have with the soundtrack is its only a little more than 30 mins which to me sucks!
B000FTWB7G|5.0|Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars.

B000IU3XTM|4.0|This isn't as good as O was. I think of O and I think of the emotional effect that songs like Eskimo, Amie and Cold Water had on me...there are no songs at the level of those songs. However, it is still a great album. Some highlights are 9 Crimes, Elephant (also known as The Blower's Daughter Part 2), Rootless Tree (a rather unexpected chorus) and Sleep Don't Weep (which sort of sounds like Cold Water).  If you like Damien Rice then I say that you have to buy this album. There honestly is no excuse not to have it. If you can only afford one Damien Rice album though, go with O.
B000I5X81K|5.0|It's been three years since 'Closer' and now we have 'Awake'.  Was it worth it?  Definitely.  Josh's voice is richer - in each album he gets so much better.  I agreed at first with another reviewer (or two) that the song choices weren't my first pick; in fact, I was surprised at the pieces that made it onto this album.  It's a departure from what I expected.  Sure, it's still got that 'classic Josh sound' we all know and love (especially on his Spanish and Italian songs) but this growth in new directions is tremendous - and laudable.  It must be difficult to stray away from familiar ground and explore other styles; 'Weeping' and 'Machine' come to mind.  So, after listening a few times I decided that the new sound/style is perfectly acceptable and great fun.   <br /> <br />And, a brief comment to those who debunk Josh's quality.  The question really isn't, \\"Can Josh sing opera?\\"  The question is really, \\"Does Josh want to sing opera?\\"  He obviously could if he wanted to, and, when you can sing like that I don't think it really matters whether or not you want to sing opera.  He was classically trained and studied at Interlochen - now it's up to him what he wants to sing.  <br /> <br />Also, unlike the previous albums, I love every song on this offering.  (On both 'Josh Groban' and 'Closer' there were at least two songs that I couldn't stand and had to skip.)  Even 'You Are Loved' pleasantly surprised me - it really is a nice song.  (Unlike the ultimately sappy 'You Raise Me Up'...shudder...)  However, my six favorites here are the gorgeous 'February Song' (simply inspired!), 'So She Dances', 'In Her Eyes', 'Solo Por Ti', 'Weeping', and 'Machine'.  I really was surprised how much I enjoyed 'Machine' - it's so much better than 'Never Let Go'.  In a word, the entire album is driven - not forced, not superficial, and not pretentious by any means.   <br /> <br />One last note; I do disagree with practically 'everyone else' and hope that Josh does not release a Christmas CD.  Instead, it would terrific if he would do a (mostly) Broadway album - 'Somewhere' (with Lea Salonga would be incredible!!), 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables', 'Quiet Please, There's a Lady on Stage' and 'You'll Never Walk Alone' (in Italian!) would be my top picks.
B00005JKES|1.0|These DVDs have a funky copy protection that caused the disc to get stuck in my mac mini.  As of yet, I have not been able to remove it.  I don't want to force it out or have to pay for something because of this manufacturer's stupidity.  It is definitely copy protected because when I tried to play it on Windows, it refused due to copyright issues.  I was only trying to play it on my PC!  I wasn't even copying it.  If you plan on watching it on your computer, forget about it... it won't work.  Not even on Media Center.  For copy protection alone I have to rate this set at the lowest setting.  If I was able to play the discs, I would give a decent recent but the protection has rendered both the discs and my computer useless!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Well, this is one of the long-waited DVDs from Pink Floyd. <br />The video and sound are great. The extras are not so special but for the PF fan this is a must. <br />Still waiting for the \\"Delicate sound of thunder\\" DVD.

He is still teaching PE and coaching boys varsity basketball.  Upon the recommendation of his cardiologist, I purchased the book.  We couldn't put it down.  It is the most compelling book on health and nutrition we have ever read!  We have radically changed the way we eat as a result of reading Dr. Campbell's book.  It is a travesty that the information found between the covers of the book is not widely known and broadcast.  It would save the lives of hundreds of thousands every year.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|Not quite as great as the s/t debut album, \\"The Pick Of Destiny\\" still has some great moments.  But there aren't any comedic interlude tracks on this album (which I think really helped the other album flow), just tiny snippets from the movie.  And a lot of the songs seem too short, which ends up making the soundtrack too short.  But the track \\"Beelzeboss (The Final Showdown)\\" is epic!  Overall, this is a great soundtrack for a movie nobody's seen yet.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I have been listening to this cd all week. It is so well engineered and recorded that it should be used as a test cd. I saw Mr. Clapton on CBS Sunday Morning Show and he and Mr. Cale looked like they really enjoyed themselves making it.  Mr. Cale's songwriting is excellent, what a wonder he is. One very pleasant surprise was the late Billy Preston playing organ and piano, the recording and engineering brings out the punch in Mr. Preston's playing.  Mr. Clapton has written a very touching song about his daughters that is a must and his guitar playing is lyrical as well.  I don't think I have ever heard him play as well.
B000EHSVQE|5.0|It seems that \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" has a very pronounced polarizing effect on viewers--you either love it or hate it. In my opinion, a film that can elicit such strong responses in an audience (for better or for worse) is worth its salt. Any movie can lull an audience into feeling a predetermined emotion, be it patriotic fervor, paranoia, lust, or nostalgia, and sometimes these movies can be very well done (but often they're two-dimensional cookie-cutter affairs). However, Napoleon Dynamite is one of a tiny group of films that remain emotionally open-ended. Reviewers condemn its \\"lack of plot\\" and bland texture, but it is only plotless and bland in the sense that you have to do a little thinking and connecting with your own life and experience to appreciate it. And maybe you won't. Maybe it hits a little too close to home, and you'd rather reject it. Maybe Ebert was right (in a sense), and you'll either pity Napoleon or, as several reviewers have proclaimed, want to beat the stuffing out of him (these people are called bullies, and one of them features prominently in the film). <br /> <br />Suffice it to say, \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is nuanced. It requires patience and understanding and empathy--there are no explosions or conspiracy theories or crude jokes. It reminded me of Wes Anderson's movies (\\"The Royal Tenenbaums,\\" \\"Rushmore,\\" \\"The Life Aquatic\\"), especially the polarized audience effect. Watch it for the subtle details, the facial expressions, the pauses for effect. Napoleon, Pedro, Deb, and Kip are average Americans--they are like you and me--we all have quirks, shortcomings, a certain level of geekiness (try as we might to cover it up or pretend otherwise; let's admit it, we're on here reviewing movies). So if you can see the humor in everyday life and laugh at yourself, you'll enjoy \\"Napoleon Dynamite.\\"
B00005JPC7|5.0|This film surprised me.  Will Farrell seems best suited for the goofball roles that he has plaed on Saturday Night Live.  I have always enjoyed his films, but this role seemed to be a little too serious for him.  I was wrong.  He played the character of Harold Crick well.  The film was very intelligent and had me laughing out loud many times.  It also left me with a very happy feeling afterward, and I felt like I had learned something from watching the film, which to me is very important. <br /> <br />A+
B000003Z12|5.0|I've been a Journey fan since the beginning of the addition of Steve Perry. It wasn't so much Steve Perrys voice that I had enjoyed as much as it really was Neal Schon's guitar playing. From the solo's in \\"Who's crying now\\" till what I thought was another great in \\"I'll Be Alright Without You\\", I had always craved more of his playing the guitar, there was never enough. It wasn't until last week I put Neal's name in search & as crazy as it sounds, never knew he had several solo cd's out. I listened to the tracks on Amazon for the \\"Beyond The Thunder\\" cd, I found exactly what I was looking for. No vocals! The guitar Neal plays, literally does all the singing in ways I would have never imagined & the dosage you will get, far outweighs anything I can compare to with Journey. No doubt Neal is a musical genius. There is not a bad track on this cd. If you like what you hear in the samples, you'll be more than pleased with this CD.I may have discovered his solo's 10 years later but with what I have been hearing in music with other artists, this couldnt have arrived for my ears at a better time! Thanks Neal!
B00005JO1R|5.0|Great film, and respectful of Johnny Cash. Well written, each character sing by their own voice and it goes smoothly in the movie. If you like Johnny Cash, take an interesting look at this movie and it goes in the same way if you like Joaquin Phoenix.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Wintersong by Sarah McLachlan is everything most Christmas records are not: sincere.  McLachlan's signature gentle melancholy is balanced by the grace and power of the lyrics of these pieces and the touching sincerity in her voice.   <br /> <br />The album kicks off on a very positive note with the majestic cover of John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\\", featuring a choir and a stirring arrangement.  What follows is the meditative, truly Enya-like \\"Greensleeves\\" that perfectly fits the reflective mood Christmas sometimes evokes.   <br /> <br />\\"River\\" is arguably the best song on the album--a luminous, wondrous song with subtle beauty that never fades.  The same could be said for the heartbreaking \\"Wintersong\\" (the lone new song on this release) which is McLachlan at her lyrical best.   <br /> <br />\\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" will surprise you if you already like the song and make you love it if you've disliked previous renditions, as will the down-home feel of \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\\" <br /> <br />We get the first epic Christmas sound on \\"The First Noel / Mary Mary\\", a brilliantly conceived two-part piece that allows McLachlan to really go to town vocally, delivering an ecstatic, breathtaking harmony near the end of the passionate tribal influences that make the song fresh.  This is followed by the understated \\"Silent Night\\" which eventually wins you over by it's simplicity.  \\"Song For A Winter's Night\\" (recorded many years before) follows in the vein of \\"Wintersong\\" but features a much more uplifting, though equally personal and intimate, arrangement.   <br /> <br />Her rendition of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\" is the best and most enjoyable version I have ever heard.  It's amazing what a wondrous voice will do with an over-killed song.   <br /> <br />\\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" (featuring Diana Krall on the piano) is the album's anti-climactic, argualby boring closer.  It's the one truly down moment on the album.  A much better finish would have been \\"In The Bleak Mid-Winter\\", one of the best songs she has ever sung.  This undercovered gem is a masterpiece lyrically and her vocal performance will bring tears to your eyes.  I can't remember the last time I heard a more sincere, emotionally veritable song, let alone a Christmas song.  The song is a quiet, though impressive, explanation mark on this stunning album.   <br /> <br />If you love typical Christmas albums, this will be a breath of fresh air for you--accentuated by Sarah's unmistakable voice.  And if you hate Christmas albums (as I do) you will fall in love with this release, which is emotionally and musically centered enough to stand alone as an album, not just \\"her Christmas thing.\\"   <br /> <br />From the Christmas album perspective, this is the best I've ever heard.  You just don't hear such emotive renditions of these classics, new and old.  The sensitivity in her voice will make these songs last far longer than most releases.  For once, on a seasonal album, you can tell she actually has a passion for what she's singing.  And if you have any passion at all for McLachlan or for the Christmas season, this will resonate deeply, undoubtedly for years to come.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|These songs all rock the house down, but if i had to guess, i would say it took Jack and Kyle no more than a couple months to put this stuff together.  Yes, we are certainly indulged with Jack's amazingly rhythmic freestyle skat; they even show off with a short sample of their harmonic a cappela abilities, but there just isn't enough. I mean c'mon TD you've had like 4 years of downtime. Nevertheless, these guys know how to make fun of rock better than anyone and this album is a must-have for anyone who is a fan.
B000J103X4|5.0|Hate him or love him, nobody can deny the heat Game brings on this album. Definitely has a laid back west coast feel. Most anticipated album of the year and it certainly delivers. I was able to listen to this album all the way through without skipping a song.

B00001OH7Y|4.0|I really like David Bowies' 1970 recordings along with 1 or 2 of the later recordings and Scary Monsters is one of them.  I believe this recording is an important addition to any record collection that includes David Bowie. <br />Michael A Cicchi.
B000J103X4|3.0|Intro: Between The Game's barrage of dis tracks and mix tapes, his beef with 50 and the G-Unit camp, and his raw talent, Game's buzz factor is off the charts.  His sophomore album, Doctor's Advocate will silence that buzz and make people wonder if Game really need 50.  <br /> <br />Synopsis: The Doctor's Advocate is sheer disappointing from start to finish. <br /> <br />The Game has always been a B-minus rhyme spitter, thanks to his countless studio name calling.  In fact, I tried to count how many times he said another rapper's name.  Which was pointless.  Even though the album is named Doctor's Advocate, there are no Dre produced tracks or any of Dre's infamous \\"Hell Yeah\\" ad libs.  But don't worry folks, The Game makes up for the lack of Dr. Dre, by setting a record for saying Dr. Dre's name in (almost) every single track.  Also, Game even raps like Dr. Dre in a couple of his songs.  None more evident then the track \\"Too Much.\\"  I literally had to look at the track listing to make sure it wasn't Dre rhyming on the track. On top of the constant name calling, the content of this CD is borderline trash.  The only identity this CD has is that The Game is from Cali, he's a blood, and he has a man-crush on Dre; which was known on the first album. <br /> <br />Final Verdict: The Doctor's Advocate is textbook example of an artist not improving on their first album.  Most artists entire lives are poured into their first album, and having a year to release a new one isn't enough time for artist with B-minus talent.  G-Unot fans will love it, and G-Unit fans will hate it.  I'm some where in the middle. <br /> <br />6.5 out of 10  <br />  <br />Standout Tracks: <br />Wouldn't Get Far feat Kayne West <br />Scream On Em <br />Doctor's Advocate feat Busta Rhymes <br />Why You Hate The Game feat Nas  <br />
B00005JPAM|5.0|There has been a wide discussion of the story of the film so I will not go into a lot of detail in that regard.  The Queen is a well acted, thought provoking film.  I cannot comment on what might have been left out, was invented or compressed to tell the story of the Royal family in the aftermath of the death of Princess Diana but what we do see rings true with the information that is generally known.  The performance by Helen Mirren is Oscar caliber; my test for a performance is how convinced I am that the actor has become the role and Ms. Mirren is Queen Elizabeth II.  Indeed, the entire cast is superb.  Michael Sheen is terrific as Tony Blair and expresses a good range of emotion dealing sternly with his staff, diplomatically with the Queen and coping with family life.  James Cromwell is also good as Prince Philip exhibiting perhaps the ultimate stiff upper lip attitude of the English upper class. Equally good is Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother, who is most concerned, so it seems that Diana's public funeral is being based off her own.  Alex Jennings makes an interesting Prince Charles; although he does not look a lot like Charles he worked into his performance the Prince's mannerisms  <br /> <br />The audience is treated to what amounts to the daily life of the Queen on summer holiday at the family estate at Balmoral.  This otherwise peaceful retreat is interrupted by the death of Princess Diana on August 30, 1997 and becomes a chronological telling of the events that occurs up to her funeral.  The film does not take a point-of-view and does not present very much about Princess Diana other than glimpses of her public life, which allows us to focus on how the Royal family dealt with her death.  It is going on ten years since the events depicted in the film occurred giving all of us a better perspective on what happened.   At the time, the Royal family came under harsh criticism for their perceived lack of reaction to Princess Diana's death; this film provides allsides and allows us to better understand the Queen and her reaction first to the death of the princess and then to the criticism of her conduct.   <br /> <br />The episode of the stag in the film is one of the events that may be fictional but it serves to remind us that Princess Diana, like the stag, was hunted for her beauty.  The Queen makes this connection in the film and so her attempt to shoo the animal away when she encounters it and her quiet sorrow when he is killed.  I think that one comes away with a better understanding of Queen Elizabeth, and one can see the influence of past generations - that of her grandmother Queen Mary - in her attitude toward the public life that she inherited from her father.  The Queen is a thought provoking film that needs to be seen. <br />

B0000TB050|5.0|This DVD was almost as good as being there.  I know, I was there, and it was PURE magic.  Cool, crisp evening, and when U2 hit the stage, it was electric.  Purely incredible.  The song list was great, and the feeling from the band was very intense.  Bono's father had passed away between the first show at Slane, and this one, so he had a very heavy heart, but still felt ok talking about it and dedicating Kite to his dad.  This was right before 9/11 in the United States, and when you watch it now, the songs reflect 9/11, as they did help so many in our country get through that time, but watching it for me, takes me back to Ireland and the magic U2 shared that night, to all of their fans that had sat all day in the misty rain, waiting for their band.  if you dont have it, buy it, everyone needs a little bit of Ireland.  Going to the country made me understand why the members of U2 are as they are.  why Bono has a passion like he does.  No one could sing these songs the way he does, coming from anywhere else in the world.  This is a very special DVD.
B000I5X81K|5.0|What a wonderful compliation of music.  I, too, have been a fan of Josh Groban from the beginning.  This album is not overrated - only underrated by a few reviewers.  For those of you who critize the foreign  tracks - Josh Groban has a large international fan base.  You may not be able to understand the lyrics, but many of those fans do,  and this album is marketed to appeal to a mass audience worldwide.
B00005K3PZ|5.0|First before reviewing the performance I am wholly obliged to note the exceptional quality of Bruckner's mighty symphony 2 in C minor.  This key often denotes fate and deep melancholy, yet in this work there is not a trace of demoralized sadness, instead it seems to tell of mighty happenings in the present and to come, indeed I thought of the apocalypse in certain passages, and remembered the 8th in C minor also contains a prophetic tiding.  Often thought of as more subtle and benign than its predecessor the 1st also in C minor, this symphony is just as exciting and well written.  The themes are so plentiful and perfect illustrations of Bruckner's melodic genius that one is hard pressed to not appreciate it as much as the other great symphonies.  Indeed the more I hear this work the more it has grown on me and its character and beauty of structure and content becomes even more apparent. Another wonderful quality of Bruckner's 2nd are its links both thematically and orchestrationally to the classical era, as well as Schubert and Beethoven.  One could go on for lines lauding this work of art.  Suffice it to say this symphony is just as wonderful to listen to as the 8th, 1st, or 4th. Now for the performance. <br /> <br />Guilini has conducted a splendid performance. The scherzo never sounded so expansive and exciting.  However in comparison with other performances it is hard to find a favorite, they all impart their own virtues.  Guilini seems to give this performance and larger canvas, as if he was conducting the 9th, this comes out splendidly in the scherzo and finale.  Overall the acoustics and instrumental clarity in each section of the orchestra is satisfactory, perhaps the timpani could have been a little more noticable.  Do not miss this performance, for two reasons: <br /> <br />1. Guilini and the orchestra perform beautifully <br />2. Bruckner's symphony 2 is a treasure one cannot do without
0895260131|1.0|This book is a well-needed antidote to those who think Islam is a \\"Religion of Peace.\\" Since its inception in the mid-seventh century, Islam has been on the warpath; it conquered half of Christendom (all of North Africa; also Spain, Turkey, and the Balkins). Robert Spencer has done a fine job documenting Islam's unremitting attack on Christianity, and Christianity's only aggresive reply, the Crusades. This book is heady reading, and necessary especially in this day and age.
B000FIMG68|5.0|All I can say is what a fantastic season, just as good as the first, if not better. I am a great fan of Matthew Fox from his Party of Five series and Haunted as well as his films. Lost is a very good gripping and entertaining show. This DVD set is well worth the money and has lots and lots of extras on it to watch. This is a must buy season as well as Season One. I cannot wait for Season Three of which I will watch on Sky One in the UK and then buy on DVD when it comes out. All I want now is for the TV company that made the excellent short lived series of Matthew's HAUNTED to be released on DVD to, it was brilliant.
0446528056|2.0|I have all of Nicholas Sparks novels, and I can honestly say that this one left much to be desired.  I have also raved about Nicholas Sparks' works to everyone; however, I don't have much to rave about this time.  The book was too predictable; although I have often figured out other story lines written by Sparks, but this book did not have half of the depth that the others have had.  I am disappointed in the book and hope to see that Nicholas Sparks goes back to his heart wrenching story lines.  Hopefully he can find time (outside of coaching track) to write another wonderful novel such as The Notebook, Message in a Bottle, The Wedding, and the list goes on (but stops at Dear John)!
B000I5X80G|4.0|These are some well recorded performances that are a sizzling testament to the raw power of Neil when he plays with Crazy Horse. It's amazing that they sat in the can for this long. The package and the playing time smack of bargain bin though - 43 minutes? - C'mon! This is no bargain priced CD. The packaging and information is absolute bare-bones.<br /><br />Am I disappointed? You bet, but I'm a fool for Neil's early work, so I'll grudgingly buy the next one too. Hopefully, it'll be a better deal.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I'll have to agree with those who state that Counterparts may be one of Rush's best overall releases.  The EQ is great, the group is tight, Alex returned to the forefront and demonstrates top chops for the effort.<br /><br />The sound is great.  Geddy's vocals are older, but richer, less piercing.  In my opinion they really put it all together for this one.  Neal is as fluid as ever.  The next release Tune for Echo has Neal taking on a different bent as he rehearsed with a notable jazz drummer to enrich is drum vocabulary.<br /><br />Counterparts is just plain tight.
B000J103X4|5.0|A lot can change within two years. Take The Game's career for one. A little less than two years ago, Game released his highly-hyped debut album to much commercial success, and mixed reviews. Some people claimed he would ressurect the West Coast; others wrote him off as an emcee who couldn't carry a track without name-dropping. Nonetheless, the sides were split; the underground wasn't feeling Game, and the mainstream adopted him as their new darling. Like I said; a lot can happen within two years. <br /> <br />Since then, Game's fanbase has become even more divided; the primary war is between fans of G-Unit, and fans of The Game. I don't need to delve into the beef one bit; we all know the story. To keep his name alive while G-Unit tried to bury his career, Game released numerous mixtapes since the split. These mixtapes were honestly take it or leave it; if you're not a hardcore G-Unot crusader, these excessive tapes did little to nothing to prove The Game was anymore than a product of the hype and controversy surrounding him. <br /> <br />Two years later, and The Doctor's Advocate has arrived; one of the most anticipated albums of the year, no doubt, by both Game supporters and detractors. His foes wanted more ammunition for their assault against Game, while his fans wanted something that would validate their undying support for the self-proclaimed West Coast Messiah. It didn't look too promising when it was announced that no tracks on this album were to be produced by Dr. Dre, when most of Documentary's bangers came from the acclaimed beatsmith. Not only that, but the title was a paradox within itself; how could Game still be the Doctor's Advocate, while being seperated from Dre and the Aftermath family? <br /> <br />A lot of questions, anticipation, and controversy tried to shroud itself over this album, veiling it for what it truly is. It failed to do so, because Game released an album that glimmers so brightly, it could give light in a solar-eclipse. At one time, I thought The Game was just an average emcee who didn't deserve the priviledges he'd been given; yeah, The Documentary was tight, but simply for its production. Gone are the days when Game was merely a mediocre emcee with hot beats; Game could truly fight for the crown of tightest mainstream rapper right now, simply based on the strength of this release alone. <br /> <br />The name-dropping remains, but it's not nearly as nerve-grating as it was on The Documentary; does he do it less? Not at all. However, he actually takes his gimmick, and adapts it to himself, unlike he was able to do on The Documentary. The Game has used to learn the name-dropping appropriately on Doctor's Advocate, using these specifics people, locations, and brands to tell a story, instead of simply relying on them for punchlines.  <br /> <br />Not only that, but Game has stepped up significantly in the lyrical department. No longer are his bars full of single-syllable, mind-numbingly simple rhymes; he interweaves multisyllables multiple times on this release, allowing a more complex, and polished side to show. He has also become an above-average story-teller; Ol' English is one of the best story-tracks on any hip-hop album released this year, commercially or independent. It definitely helps that Hi-Tek provides an utterly dope track for Game to rhyme over, and Dion, who is quickly becoming one of my favorite singers, provides the incredibly catchy hook. <br /> <br />No longer is Game also the emotionless robot he once was; he shows an amazing range of emotions on tracks such as Doctor's Advocate(this album's best cut) and Why You Hate The Game, which also both feature appearances from hip-hop legends(Busta and Nas, respectively) and Marsha of Floetry, who has become a regular Game collaborator.  <br /> <br />While Dre's production is missing, it's stupifying that without Dre's production, this album is actually MORE West Coast oriented than it's predecessor. Da ****, the aforementioned Ol' English, California Vacation, Bang, Remedy, and Compton are all certified left-coast bangers. Guest apperances from West Coast veterans like Snoop, Daz, Gotti, and X to the Z definitely help add to the atmosphere, as well.  <br /> <br />There are honestly no loose strings on this album; even the weaker offerings like Scream On 'Em and Wouldn't Get Far are above average, and warrant a spot on the album. Is it classic? It could admittedly become a classic within time, but at the moment, I'll say no, as Game still has room for improvement, and could top this with his subsequent release. While it may not be classic at the moment though, an album that is thoroughly dope gets the rating it deserves; 5 stars. Even if you're a certified hater of the game, you'd have to be fronting to say you didn't enjoy this album. <br /> <br />Congratulations, Game; you've released an album that will shut your critics up, and even convert them to fans. I know you certainly did with me, and I look forward to following your career for the rest of its duration. Backpacker, sheep, or casual hip-hop listener; this album is for you.
B000H6SXMY|4.0|Some fans of NBC's Friends will begin and end their collection of Friends episodes with this item. Others have already purchased the ten season sets individually. This 1994-2004 sitcom has made big stars out of Jennifer Aniston,Courteney Cox Arquette,Lisa Kudrow,Matt LeBlanc,Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer. However,Schwimmer has been out of the public eye mostly since the sitcom ended its run. This might be thought of by some as \\"Three's Company times two\\",since there are six principal characters. When Friends premiered,other hit sitcoms still in prime-time were Frasier,Fox's Married...With Children,ABC's Roseanne and CBS's Murphy Brown. NBC pulled the plug on Frasier along with Friends. Like on ABC's Three's Company,the six Friends were sharing apartments together to cut back on living expenses. Post-Friends,Aniston has been relentlessly making movies like she has been when the sitcom was still on the air. During the run,in July 2000,she married Brad Pitt,they are now divorced. CCA kept a low profile. Pre-Friends,she had a recurring role as Lauren Miller on another NBC sitcom,Family Ties from 1987 to '89. She co-starred opposite Jim Carrey in his first starring film ACE VENTURA-PET DETECTIVE. When she married David Arquette,she adopted his name. Kudrow currently has a series on Cable TV's Home Box Office. LeBlanc continues his role of Joey Tribbiani on Friends' spinoff Joey. Pre-Friends,he became the star of the MWC not-too-successful spinoff Top Of The Heap opposite Joseph Bologna. Perry,like CCA,maintained a low profile. All six stars have made movies during and after the sitcom's run(Aniston is the most consistent of the six). You can see Aniston in films like OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION,RUMOUR HAS IT and BRUCE ALMIGHTY,to name a few. Perry co-starred with Elizabeth Hurley in the 2002 Paramount comedy SERVING SARA. Schwimmer starred in 1998's KISSING A FOOL. Kudrow co-starred with Mira Sorvino in ROMY & MICHELLE'S HIGH SCHOOL REUNION. Also,at least most of the sixhave guest-hosted NBC's Saturday Night Live on various occasions. These six actors will long be remembered and will eventually receive stars on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame.
0345350499|5.0|Reading the other comments and also book reviews from other sources, I noticed that many stress the fact that this is a re-telling of the Arthur saga, and many claim it's the best one they've ever read. I can't comment on that, since my knowledge of the story prior to this book was restricted to \\"something about a peasant who took a sword out of a stone and became king\\". <br /> <br />The book is definitely among the best I've ever read. The story spreads over more than 50 years, and shows how characters evolve and the events that lead to changes in their personalities. The reader never gets lost though (as opposed to what happens in The Silmarillion, for example) since the storyline is presented in a way such that the reader can keep up with the background of each and every character (and there are dozens of them). <br /> <br />At some points, the perspectives from different characters on a single event are shown separately, and these passages really show how people defending completely opposing religious opinions can actually both be right at the same time. <br /> <br />A lot of work has gone into writing this, and it easily shows. I highly recommend it, just as it was highly recommended to me.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|i am an electric blues finatic, listing Stevie Ray, Albert King,Otis Rush, Luther Allison, Buddy Guy, and Albert Collins as favorites. well move over boys, your link to the future of blues is alive and well with \\"Jumpin Joe\\" Bonamassa. this is up there w my alltime favorite blues cd \\"IN SESSION\\" by Stevie Ray and Albert. his 7 minute long performance of \\"burning hell\\" makes John Lee Hooker look like an amateur. i played this outside the Oakland Coliseum, before the last Raider game, and every person, of every color, sex, and age game over bobbing their head and tapping their feet, and asked me who that was. my answer was \\"Jumpin Joe\\" Bonamassa. buy this immediately, if you ever say you're an electric blues fan. Stevie Ray is applauding in blues heaven!!
B00005JM0B|5.0|More action means more excitement.  That's exactly what made the Terminator movies so great.  That's exactly what makes this movie so great, despite the predictable overwhelming amount of negative reviews.   <br /> <br />Nothing wrong with Rise of the Machines unless you happen to be really picky.  Are you picky?  ARE you?
B000GUK63K|5.0|This brilliant debut album by the late, great guitar legend is also one of the best albums of all time and you'll see this album in the top half of practically every top 100 lists of best albums and for very good reason too.  Released in 1967, the year of The Beatles' \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band\\" this rock hard power trio combo was unlike anything that anyone had ever heard before except perhaps Pete Townsend's The Who and Eric Clapton's Cream but the influence was immense and rock music was never the same again.  No weak tracks on this album and every track is brilliant here with no fillers in sight.  This version of this seminal album is also the best one that's out there at present.  The sound quality has been remastered very, very well and the mini-lp replica cardboard packaging is a work of art too.  We get two bonus tracks albeit in mono: \\"Highway Chile\\" and \\"51st Anniversary\\" but all 17 tracks are simply gems and classic rock standards.  We get a 24 page colour booklet with all the lyrics plus great liner notes about the band plus another booklet which contains the lyrics in Japanese as well.  For fans and students of great classic rock as well as aspiring rock guitarists out there, this, indeed all Jimi's albums are required listening.  Very, very highly recommended!
B000ICM5VW|3.0|Watching this movie in high definition was a treat.  The picture is amazingly clear and the sound is impressive.  For movie viewing it will be hard to watch anything with less of a picture now.<br /><br />My problem comes with the movie.  King Kong is far from an enjoyable movie to me.  When I watch an action movie I want action.  This movie was so diluted with anemic acting and a rather boring story line.  I waited over an hour to see some action and even after that it was limited.  This movie is over three hours long and is a good sleepy time tale but when it comes to action I will view something else.
B000GUK644|5.0|Carrying on from the experimentation with sound effects that he started on the second album, \\"Axis: Bold As Love\\", Hendrix takes his experimentation on to an even higher level resulting in this masterpiece of music which is his best album.  Although not as popular as his relatively commercial and hit strewn debut album, Hendrix' legacy as a great experimenter proponent of rock guitar is never more evident than on this brilliant album.  For this reason, Hendrix reminds me a lot of Miles Davis who was also never content to stay in a commercial rut but was always surprising everyone with his innovation.  Hendrix was to rock what Davis was to jazz.  Everyone's heard of \\"Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)\\" and the Bob Dylan cover \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" and yet these are not even the stronger tracks on this album.  For example the first version of \\"Voodoo Chile\\" which was way too long to be a single in those days offers a lot more gems to treasure as well as the brilliant \\"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\\" among many others.  This as is the case for all truly classic albums has to be heard completely at one sitting to truly receive the Jimi Hendrix Experience which is the best way to describe listening to this and indeed his two previous albums as well.  You don't just listen to his music, it is truly an experience.  This version of the album is also the best one that's out there at the moment.  The mini-replica cardboard gatefold sleeve packaging is a work of art in itself and it comes with a 24 page booklet with liner notes written by Jimi himself among others as well as a separate booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  The sound quality has also been remastered to perfection making this essential listening for all classic rock fans as well as aspiring rock guitarists.  Very, very highly recommended!
B000H0MKOC|4.0|I tend to be hard on a lot of major motion pictures because, to be frank, they mostly suck. However, this only turned into a \\"major motion picture\\" after Fox Searchlight bought it after it's screening at the Sundance Film Festival. Before that it was the vision of fledgling director Jason Reitman to independently bring Christopher Buckley's tremendously smart and funny book of the same name to the screen... and he does a good job. There's a reason why this film is loaded with the (mostly unpaid or underpaid) who's who of Hollywood talent. The script and screenplay are that good. This is not the typical low-brow, fart-joke riden crap you're used to seeing out of Hollywood. There are good acting performances throughout as well. If you are a person of above average wit and have a dry sense of humor, you'll like it.
B00007KKXJ|4.0|Not only is this a great concept album by Stevie, it's also his best effort and it also stands the test of time to emerge as one of the best albums of all time. As they say, \\"the cream always rises to the top\\" and this is surely the case for this album. This gatefold mini-lp sleeve cardboard replica version is also the best version of the album that is out there at the moment. The sound quality is good due to the remastering job they did although not great which is understandable given the state of the 1976 original master and so some tracks have higher volume levels than others. However, the tracks are things of beauty and stand the test of time. Although there is \\"single\\" material in here, the only way to truly appreciate this work of art is to listen to the whole thing at one go. For the record, the \\"single\\" stuff that still sound good today are: \\"Sir Duke\\" and \\"Isn't She Lovely\\". The other standout tracks must be \\"Pastime Paradise\\" later ripped off to great effect for the \\"Dangerous Minds\\" soundtrack \\"Gangster's Paradise\\" and \\"Black Man\\" is a fantastic study in slap bass that would make Mark King of Level 42 proud. There is also a track on disc two that sounds a lot like Lionel Ritchie's \\"All Night Long.\\" It's obvious that many, many artistes have been inspired over the years by this album and I sure many, many more will be over the decades to come. Very highly recommended.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I'm a huge Cale fan and was worried that Clapton's presence might ruin this effort with an \\"overproduced\\" sound.  To the contrary, the Cale influence dominates with Clapton fitting in extremely well.  The vocals are pretty much shared which is fine.  This is an extension of Cale's signature genre(a melding of blues, country, rock, jazz, whatever) that remains \\"laid back\\" yet still brings the beat and never degenerates into detestable soft rock.  He's always had the touch.  Clapton gets it as well as anyone.  This is a buy.
B000I5X80G|4.0|I've been waiting for this release since the mid-1970's when Neil collected some of his best work and archives into the 3-LP \\"Decade.\\" To say I'm a bit disappointed in the length of this CD is an understatement. Instead of a proper archives release, Young and archivist Joel Bernstein have selected 6 tracks from the electric set with backing band Crazy Horse.<br /><br />\\"Live at the Fillmore East\\" does feature some excellent audio quality and passionate performances frozen in time, but for me, this is just the first of several CD's for Neil Young fans only. I hope the next release is more substantial than the hors d'oeuvres presented here.
0446528056|2.0|I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan and I was very disappointed with this book.  Too predictable, very depressing... <br /> <br />
0618680004|4.0|Many parties object to Mr Dawkins' works because they fear that he may snatch away the crutch of faith from such parties who are genuinely in need of its solace. Well yes, I'd like to be able to think that paradise awaited me somewhere beyond space and time, but as Mr Dawkins reminds us, there is not the slightest bit of evidence for such an assumption, and since so many parties attempt to justify their actions with reference to 'religious truth' I fear that religion cannot be kept off limits. <br /> <br />I don't make a habit of proclaiming my atheism in public, because I know that plodding minds will brand me as 'negative' and 'cynical' (free-thinkers are often branded as such), but we do need people like Ibn Warraq and Dawkins how remind us who dubious religion is, be it Christianity, Judaism, Islam or the worship of the spirits of the forest which has produced that new age nonsense when people trot around communing with the trees.   <br /> <br />The only danger is that Dawkins overstates his case, and perhaps he doesn't show enough understanding for those believers who are constantly beset by doubt and who drift in and out of faith.  Most intelligent people, and that includes 'believers' agree that religious truth isn't truth at all because it can't be proven, and I think most sensible Jews and Christians have a lot of difficulty with the angry God of the Old Testament and all that crazy stuff in Leviticus about not eating skunks and stoning homosexuals to death.  Then there's that mad book where everyone begets everyone else, like in those tables which explain the parentage of race horses.  A great deal of begetting.  <br /> <br />I won't be reading the whole book we do still need people like Dawkins who have a go at the loopy assumptions of true believers, and in a way, he might just as well be having a go at secular 'believers'- the unrepentent communists, the 'animal rights' activists, and the gruesome white supremacists.  They are all beset by blind faith and if Mr Dawkins can undermine this then I for one, with the vehemence of a madcap arm- waving evangelical (don't you hate it when they do that?), shout allelujah. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005LOUP|5.0|This is one of the newest Christmas classic movies but it's earned its spot as one of the best Christmas films.  The jokes are hilarious, the acting over-the-top (but this type of film requires it I think) and the storyline brilliant.  This is a must for every family.  It's classic!
B000I5X824|4.0|You wouldn't have expected any less, would you? Staind have officially been around for ten years. Five albums into their career, four of which are full of memorable hits, it makes sense that Staind are putting out a \\"Singles\\" collection. It also makes sense because like Cold, Nonpoint, Taproot and P.O.D. before them, Staind are apparently severing ties with their record label, Atlantic. What a perfect escape route!<br /><br />Sounds Like: A contractual obligation.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />- Well, it's Staind and so long as you're a fan, these songs will always be good.<br /><br />- Even if you own all the albums, there are more than a few extras thrown your way. In addition to the Family Values 1999 version of \\"Outside\\" replacing the rather bland studio version, there are also four live and acoustic tracks (three of which are covers!)<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- The omission of \\"Just Go\\" (why do they always ignore that song?), \\"Fade\\" and \\"How About You.\\"<br /><br />Hits: Well, they're all hits, but for the fans, the acoustic numbers are where it's at. \\"Nutshell,\\" an Alice In Chains cover, stands far and above the rest. There have been many bands performing this song in the past (I have recordings of Seether, Cold, Shinedown and Adema doing it) but no one has done it as beautifully and effortlessly as Aaron Lewis and company. \\"Sober\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" Tool and Pink Floyd covers respectively, are great as well, in addition to the acoustic rendition of \\"Everything Changes.\\" Hell, they even threw in a souped up version of \\"Come Again\\" from their 1996 indie album, \\"Tormented,\\" in case you don't own it already.<br /><br />Misses: Just the songs they left off.<br /><br />Personally: I've been a Staind fan since \\"Dysfunction\\" and this collection does the band justice. I can forgive what they left out mainly because I own all that stuff already and because the unreleased material is worth the while. Few bands are as good with \\"Greatest Hits\\" as Staind are with this one. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Best Listened To When: Ending a relationship with a record label.this one. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Best Listened To When: Ending a relationship with a record label.
032147404X|4.0|Kelby's book does a good, nearly great, job at teaching you (or suggesting as it were) how to take all kinds of different pictures. It's packed with good, illustrative photos and covers a lot of ground. The best thing by far though is that you, within minutes really, are capable of putting the information to use in real life. You don't need to read it from cover to cover. You can look up any subject that interests you and just read that one page and then you're off shooting. The size of the book also allows you to take it with you in your bag while shooting, which is a big plus.       It's not perfect though. Reading \\"The Digital Photography Book\\" I coulden't help but feeling that Mr. Kelby was paid by the word writing this book. There is a quite a lot of useless text in the book (\\"humour\\" as the author calls it), which really got on my nerves. This gives a feeling of the author \\"not caring\\" in a sense (he had a quota to fill, not a goal of giving the reader the best possible book).That space could have been used to give the reader even more photo advice (not that it's scarce as it is, but still).         However, if you ignore the \\"humourous\\" parts of the book it's really good. The quality of the advice given far exceeds its flaws. More than worth the price.
B000J103X4|3.0|Game did his thing on this CD without The Doc or G Unit. However that is probably the reason this CD won't sell 5 million albums, also most everyone I know has had this CD for about 3 weeks. Game messed up by not listening to Dre and Hate G Unit or not they SELL ALBUMS. Game was better off with 50 (now everyone is saying f*** G Unit, but you were all on their side when they first came out) None the less Game does a descent job. <br /> <br />Favorites <br /> <br />The Doctors Advocate Ft. Busta <br />One Blood (the remix is awesome) <br />Wouldn't get Far Ft. Kayne <br />Ol' English
B000J103X4|2.0|Lets get one thing out of the way. This album sounds great due to the lineup of excellent producers Game was able to get aid from. He also had many great features on this album, but did Game really give us something new? This time around there was more of the same name-dropping and bragging that worked on the last album, and this does not help Game's album gain any originality. Other than \\"It's Ok(One Blood),\\" \\"Compton,\\" \\"One Night,\\" and \\"Doctor's Advocate,\\" the Game doesn't really provide a window to his deepest thoughts rather than a window into what every other west coast rapper has said before. At one point, the album becomes monotonous because it lacks continuity and cohesion, and instead provides rambled ideas. \\"The Documentary\\" was Game's gem, and despite the fact that he has room to improve, you simply can't call this one a classic. Game the potential to become a \\"rap legend\\" as he proclaimed in 04's \\"Dreams,\\" but he has to find his own style instead of copying past West Coast icons.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|My wife and I saw \\"Love Actually\\" when it first came out and fell in love with the movie instantly. Yes, Richard Curtis uses every trick to pull at our heartstrings, but it works.  And the crescendos and the various climaxes of each story keeps pulling me in. <br /> <br />When the movie first appeared on HBO, I always seem to find it and couldn't stop watching until the end of the movie.  I bought the DVD and it's become a family tradition to watch it Christmas Eve (most years).  And it never gets old. <br /> <br />I am not a fan of Christmas movies.  I've never seen all of \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" or \\"Its a Wonderful Life\\", but I'm looking forward to sitting on the sofa with my wife to watch \\"Love Actually\\" again.
B000J103X4|5.0|The Game does his thing yet again, establishing himself one of hip-hop's few pre-eminent MC's with Weezy, Kweli, Nas & Lupe...he carries the West Coast on his shoulders all by himself...with NO dre, even tho I can't wait for Detox. Dre's influence can be felt all over this album, and to me - that's a phenomenal thing. How could you expect an LA MC, specifically one from Compton, to not have Dre's style infused throughout his entire personality? Dre infused his style into everyone who lives and breathes west coast hip-hop, and Game takes it to the next level. Move over calvin, jayceon came to play...
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars is an amazing show.  I look forward to it every week, and love having the DVD to watch when ever I want.  With creative writing, a great cast, and even better mysteries each week, no show tops Veronica Mars.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I want to copy and paste someone's statement from below because I think his opening statement was strong enough to summarize.  \\"A milestone in the war against musical incompetence\\".<br /><br />Iron Maiden are supremely talented musicians and stand out in the heavy metal genre for a number of reasons, not the least of which are their lyrical depth, skillful composition and tremendous skill and accuracy in playing.  I like several styles of music and I absolutely don't think many metal bands garner these kind of accolades.  Iron Maiden not only blows the roof off with their \\"metalness\\", they do it at a skill level that nears Steve Vai/Joe Satriani, Neil Peart, Chris Squire (of Yes), and with subjects far deeper and more mystical than the T&A and fast cars subjects that are very worn out in metal.<br /><br />This album is exceptional!  Brave New World, Blood Brothers and Ghost of The Navigator are standouts.  That said, there are no weak links.
0743298020|2.0|I bought this book with much anticipation, after having heard so many good things about it.  It is a well-written book.  However, there are several themes that bothered me enough to make me stop reading - themes such as incest, abuse, and overall dysfunction.  These things distracted and bothered me to the point of not being able to look past them and enjoy the wonderful language and atmosphere in the book.  I feel the book would have been much better without the disturbing content.
0312330537|5.0|This is one of the best books i've read.  The story is captivating, emotionally charged and fast-paced.  The reflections the author includes about the meaning of his experiences make the book even more enjoyable.
B000HCO840|5.0|Xmen III is one of the best movies ever!! <br />The intense battle between the different philosophies of Xavier and Magneto is at its peak in the last Xmen movie The Last Stand, a tale of survival.  This movie emcompasses all genres such as politics, action, romance, comedy, drama, horror, etc...this movie has something for everyone! <br />From the politics of the Cure, to the forced suppression of the Dark Pheonix of Jean Grey, the internal conflict between right and wrong surfaces throughout this thought-provoking movie.  Not only is the storyline beautifully philosophical, the actors and actresses express their emotions with perfect intensity.  With the perfect combination of story telling and presentation, one can understand both perspectives, whether it is for Xavier or Magneto.   <br />This movie is nothing but perfect.
B000001DTM|4.0|I am not the biggest U2 fan in the world. Indeed I do find them mostly talked up beyond their true quality as a band. Having said that, this is a genuinely great CD. See I never thought I would admit it, but it does sit happily in my CD collection with a whole host of other classic albums. My problem with U2 generally is they release great singles then the complete album usually disappoints. I am happy to say this one does not.
B000HT386M|2.0|The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the \\"comics\\" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring.<br /><br />Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.<br /><br />Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Now just because it's my favorite doesn't mean it's the best overall (I'm slightly more partial to From Russia With Love) but I was roughly 12 when I first saw Goldeneye and honestly, it was awesome. That awesome went into a different stratosphere of awesome when the classic Goldeneye videogame was released for the Nintendo 64. When it comes down to favorite Bonds, mine tends to be Sean Connery but there's always a place for Pierce Brosnan, especially since this was the first Bond film I ever saw. It kickstarted the series, gave us a new Bond and it was all the better for it. <br /> <br />During an infiltration of a weapons facility, 006 Alec Trevelyan is captured and apparently killed leaving 007 James Bond having to escape. 9 nine years later, an experimental helicopter is stolen and its theft is linked to the Janus Crime Syndicate. This is linked to the theft of the Goldeneye, a twin pair of satellites that when detonated, triggers an EMP (electromagnetic pulse), capable of frying anything with a circuit board. With help of Natalya, a Russian computer programmer, Bond has to stop Janus a.k.a his old friend Alec Trevelyan and stop his plan for what else? world domination.  <br /> <br />After the financial and critical failure of License to Kill, it took a good 6 years before Goldeneye came out. And with it came a new Bond, replacing Timothy Dalton. Dalton in a way was an admirable Bond to like but hard to absolutely love. Brosnan, ultimately, is probably my 2nd favorite Bond after Connery. While the more intense persona isn't seen, he nails that playboy-esque side of 007 as well as the resourceful and knowledgeable side who can shoot his way through anything. However the subsequent films relied a bit too heavily on action and big stunts so the more character side kind of got sidetracked. <br /> <br />Maybe it's because I've played the game sooo many times but the film almost seems better than it is. Yeah it's very loud and very action-intensive but there's also abit of character-related moments that I liked seeing, such as Bond getting chewed out by a new M (Judi Dench) or the night before Bond is to infiltrate an enemy stronghold, knowing his friend is the main enemy. To me it's a very succesful entry in the Bond franchise that would have another good entry with Tomorrow Never Dies but the latest 2 were kind of awful. <br /> <br />Is it a great Bond film? Well I'm probably the wrong guy to ask. Since this was my first one, there's an obvious bias to it and while it would'nt eclipse some of the better ones, there is an accessibility to it that I find enduring.
1582405956|3.0|I love Frank Cho's work. He has a crisp style; his lines flex and curve perfectly. It's hard to think of anyone outside of Dave Stevens who shows as much grace. However... <br /> <br />I dinged it one star for not having any color plates.  All of the pages are black and white. An uncensored version of the cover is on the interior flap at a greatly reduced size.  Compare this to \\"The Fantastic Art of Frank Frazetta\\" nos. 1 - 5 which not only had color plates but also details/enlargements of the paintings.  Same with the three Frank Kelly Freas books: many color plates.  The cover painting is so good that I was enormously disappointed when I openned the book and found only black and white sketches and finished drawings. <br /> <br />I dinged it another star for having almost no text to accompany the drawings and the small amount of text was insipid and patronizing. Little fragments like \\"note the thickness at her ankles. But not too thick,\\" and \\"nice long calves,\\" and \\"nice full hips.\\"  <br /> <br />The sketches and drawings are all outstanding, but not worth collecting in a hardcover book.  It will make a good softcover book.
B00000F1D3|5.0|The Legendary Cher returned to the music charts with the strong release of 'Believe' after her overlooked 'It's A Man's World' cd didn't get the attention it deserved!, 'Believe' is a strong dance cd that took the music world by storm, showing how wonderful Cher's voice is with some very good dance tracks! This includes a nice dance remix of her hit 'We All Sleep Alone', if you want to own one of Cher's best cd's or just a great dance cd you can't go wrong with 'Believe'!
1932100660|5.0|As a physician, I know how little is taught to medical students about nutrition.  As an amateur chef, I've read for years about what we need to do for our diet in order to be healthier.  Large studies, such as the Framingham study, do make comments about exercise and nutrition, but as far as I know have never gone into the detail that Dr. Campbell has.   His credentials are impeccable.  His research is impressive.  It brought everything together for me.   I've stopped eating meat and avoid most dairy.   I bought 12 copies for family and friends immediately, because I felt that I was ethically bound to do this.   Now I'm ordering more copies.  It is a terrific example of how information that can literally be lifesaving is suppressed by many means.  I only wish I'd had this info when I was 40 instead of 62.  Of course, my husband, a cardiologist, so far has not read the book.  He does eat everything I cook.
B000FP2Z0S|4.0|Rise Against is one of the few punk bands I can think of that was able to cross over into the mainstream, and yet still keep virtually their entire fan base intact. I'm not here to complain about the major label thing, because in reality bands who are as talented as Rise Against and make as good of music as Rise Against do deserve to achieve success and be rewarded for their hard work. As far as \\"The Sufferer And The Witness\\" goes, this is definitely the band's best effort since 2003's \\"Revolutions Per Minute.\\" Some of the anger and abrassiveness that was lost in \\"Siren Song Of The Counter Culture\\" is back, but large and all TSATW is simply a stand alone album. Exactly the kind of record punk needed right now.    Not to say I had lost faith, but \\"Siren Song..\\" definitely left me wanting more. It was alright all around, but it lacked in many areas that its stellar predessecor \\"Revolutions Per Minute\\" excelled in. Well TSATW is back in full force. While \\"Chamber The Cartridge\\" might not have the furious feel of previous openers like \\"Black Masks and Gasoline\\" and \\"State Of The Union,\\" it's melodic and upbeat approach is a perfect way to lead off the cd. This is only a taste of things to come though, because from this point on the record just gets better and better. The first single \\"Ready To Fall\\" is nice throwback to their older days, mixing some abrassive screaming, speedy drumming, and a stellar chorus. I Wouldn't say there is necessarily a lot of heavier or harder material here, but TSATW definitely houses some of the best material Rise Against has written to date, particularly the string of tracks 5,6,7 (\\"Under The Knife,\\" \\"Prayer Of The Refugee,\\" and \\"Drones\\" respectively). All around the quality of the tracks here is far above that of many music acts today. And given the band's approach to relate and honest and important messages with their music, TSATW is one of the best treats you're likely to hear this year. Musically they have their punk edge, yet they're still expanding. Lyrically they still wish to get a message across to their listeners. Sounds like a band that will continue to be great in the future.    I couldn't be more pleased with \\"The Sufferer And The Witness.\\" Some have mentioned slight production issues, and it's true these are apparrent. Whether this was due to the label or designed to be this way, I would say overall the production doesn't inhibit the listening experience at all. Even if you're not used to listening to record with lesser production, it shouldn't be anything of issue. This is probably the second best record the band has ever released (coming in second to \\"Revolutions Per Minute\\"). I hope these guys continue to prove why they are one fo the only bands who garner respect from both the underground and the mainstream alike. If you're a newcomer and enjoy this disc, their older releases are essential as well. The future still seems bright.
0895260131|4.0|This was a fascinating look into the violent history and present of Islam.  It revealed an aspect of Islam about which no one is willing to talk.  The downside, however, was that, toward the end, the book began to get repetitious and a bit tedious.
B000I5X81K|3.0|I just purchased AWAKE, and was very disappointed in the choice of music. Josh is a favorite of mine, his voice, range are superior. The first two CDs had some great songs on them. I will listen to it again. However, it was a huge let down from the prior ones. Josh you can do much better, do not let the producers or anyone change your style. It is the style that makes you unique. This just does not cut it. Great voice, poor songs.
B00000HZTB|5.0|I'll only say this once: Lou Reed is not a pop star or a pop musician or anyone you could categorize as compared to anybody. Lou Reed is anti-everbody. He just wants to rock. RIP, the late Robert Quine who really made this album by goading a new, sober Lou into playing the guitar again, Lou is better than Jimi Hendrix. Always. (If anybody calls me on this I will provide a bunch of easy career examples.) He just didn't always know it sometimes. My House begins the album and you know why: you have two crazy-tuned guitars dancing around over a bassist and drummer who are just understanding each other, live on tape, that this is more sensitive than jazz and more experimental and intense and moving than anything you've heard before. It sets the tone. This is Lou Reed with 3 musicians in an odd improvisational experiment. The Velvets were his best band, sure, but to walk into a studio with strangers and pull this off? This album is controlled, newly sober, experimental and joyful and feedback and soul and drone and rage. This album is Lou Reed born again. <br />I'm a big fan. I'm also honest enough to say he does this only every once in a while...

6305754969|5.0|My entire family loves this classic movie - this is a movie that everyone can watch over and over.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Masterful, simply masterful.  There is no other word that can adequately convey the quality of this movie.  Every time I notice it on cable, I immediately stop whatever I am doing and follow it to conclusion.  I can think of no other Shakespearean film that echoes it except possibly, \\"The Tragedy of Julius Caesar\\" (Marlon Brando as Marc Anthony).  A commanding performance by Kenneth Branaugh, who should be knighted as a peer of the realm in my opinion, before another title is handed over to a Rolling Stone.  This film is the sole reason I still have VHS.  If anyone enjoyed this movie, I highly recommend the Brando version of Julius Caesar and Henry the Fifth 1989 - Kenneth Branaugh and see if you notice a young Christian Bale - the boy who would be Batman.  I have had many lively discussions with respected elders regarding the better Shakespearean actor - Olivier or Branaugh.  My money's on Branaugh.

0684801558|4.0|\\"It is the manner of life seldom to strike but always to wear away.\\" In The Beautiful and Damned, the author, F. Scott Fitzgerald creates a compelling struggle between life and his two dynamic characters Anthony and Gloria. Fitzgerald inserts his own questions of life and relationships in the offhand statements of his characters, usually too well placed to even be noticed by the reader. And such is the manner of The Beautiful and Damned, to strike at the soul and mind and to wear away our own definitions and conceptions through silent screams of indecision, fear and regret.          Fitzgerald uses his understanding of literature and the power of words to convey two stories: one on the surface, and one, hidden below all plot lines, running deep within each character and within all people who have ever dared to live. He uses color and imagery to clue his readers to this underlying message. Also, Fitzgerald writes in a \\"play-like\\" manner, with certain character dialogues, a sense of staging, narration and even in some parts of the book even special \\"play-like\\" formatting. This method creates an image of the surface plot, the plot the reader can tangibly grasp: the raised print on the page, the crisp sheets, the grammar and the structure of the story. These elements leave behind all that the reader feels and understands on a deeper level inside the mind, making each reader digest all this information alone, because it is not just bluntly stated by Fitzgerald on paper. This story allows the reader to just read a story, or to jump into the structure of the mind and soul, freeing locked feelings and questions. Fitzgerald's power is to massage his words giving each phrase the power to strike the reader and let them see themselves for the first time.
B000002UCN|5.0|Again, songs I remember from the 70's and so good to hear again!
B0000C03AH|5.0|Ever since this superb set was released more than forty years ago, there's been agreement even among its most fervent supporters that the Pastoral is, as Mark Twain might have said, a good walk spoiled. I beg to differ. Beethoven was no duffer. As many contemporaries noted, he strode out to the countryside at a brisk pace. And, I believe, once he got there, Beethoven did not seek to depict repose or bucolic bumptiousness or even metaphysical thanksgiving. Karajan -- sounding better than ever in this remastering -- seems to be telling us that Beethoven was alive to the shimmering, pulsating, unified vitality of nature. It's been written that Karajan did not like the Sixth Symphony. I have found no statement anywhere to that effect by this nature-loving conductor himself, and certainly no evidence of it in this glorious recording.
0618680004|2.0|The reason why many people gave this book 5 stars is not because of its flowing prose, its sophisticated thinking, or its originality, but because the reviewers agree with what Dawkins is saying already.  It quickly becomes clear that Dawkins is not out to make a balanced assessment of the effect of religion on society, but to pick and choose the most extreme or the most off-putting religious groups and uphold them as the norm.  He also assumes, like many atheists, that most people are capable of loving and obeying like an unthinking lemming an essentially cruel god.  This idea is very contemptous to those that practice their religion and are good people, which is most of the practicing religious.  Also, Dawkins never goes into the heart of any religion, only atheistic and reductionist preconceptions.  I read somewhere else that he admitted he could not experience a spiritual occurrence even in an experiment to simulate it.  One cannot be extremely dismissive of something one has no real understanding or grounding in.  I would advise everybody who agrees with this book to read \\"The world's religions\\" by Huston.  He summarizes the world's major religions: Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, and Confucianism (and maybe others) very very well.  Huston is a man who really tried to get inside the logic of the world's religions.  Dawkins, on the other hand, did not spend any significant time to do original research.  He started with an assumption, set up the question in such a way that it's obvious who's going to be right, and lo, proved his point.

B000IU3XTM|5.0|It has been a long time coming and is certainly worth the wait.  While 9 is very different than his debut album 0, I think it is every bit as good.  The bar was set very high because it seems that everyone who has 0 absolutely loves it, it got very good reviews and I think it was in Rolling Stone where it said it was the best album of 2003 that you aren't listening to.  Having said that I think that 9 is just as good.  I couldn't wait for it's release and it is fabulous.  I can't stop listening to Elephant, to me that is the best song on the album.  If you don't own any Damien Rice cd's I would definately say to get 0 first,then you won't have any choice but to buy this, you will be hooked.  He is by far my favoirte artist, I have listened to 0 and not been sick of it for 3 years, it is still the first cd I reach for.  Damien Rice is brilliant, I have never had a singer/songwriter make me so emotional about music, it is the kind of music you can't stop thinking about, if you don't own a Damien Rice cd you are missing out.
B00005JLPK|3.0|Despite the fact Salma Hayek not only has a monobrow but also a moustache (and god knows where else she was hairy!), she still looks stunning. It's the worst possible look a girl could go for, and definitely made me reach for the tweezers after watching Frida.<br /><br />Salma Hayek went all out to get this movie the greenlight. I personally didn't know who the hell Frida was before watching the film, and after, I know she's an artist. But what else can you learn about Frida? She was a very open minded girl, not afraid of her own sexuality, and Salma as an actress is not ashamed of her body. After a very painful accident (which is followed by a weird surreal, drug induced dream, that the hospital is manned by skeletons), most of Frida's life is in paintings. Everything came out, and although some of her paintings were very strange, some of them could make your heart break.<br /><br />Frida's relationship with Diego, (played by Alfred Molina, who put on 50lbs to play the role) is complicated at that. He regularly cheated, she yelled, she threw him out, only to discover she couldn't live without him. It's a love that stayed, despite the cheating, and she did her fair share too.<br /><br />There's a whole host of recognisable faces in this, including Antonio Banderas in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role, and Ashley Judd, Also, the gorgeous Valeria Golino, who I recognised from Rain Man, and is just as gorgeous as she was then.<br /><br />Frida is a very emotional film, but it's not that memorable after finishing it. It leaves the viewer with no lasting impression, and you'll forget it the next day. Just keep plucking your eyebrows and bleaching your moustache.

6304696515|1.0|Of course, I saw Cruel Intentions first, and it appealed to me more because of Ryan & Reese. (No longer Hollywood's Golden Couple, if they can't last, what hope is there for us mere mortals?) You always prefer the one you see first, and for me, it is definitely Cruel Intentions. Plus, I have a tendancy to detest 'costume' films, and can never sit through them (Emma, Sense & Sensibility etc).<br /><br />Although there is a lot similar between Dangerous Liasions & Cruel Intentions (many of the lines stay practically the same), and Swoosie Kurtz, who plays Madame de Volange, went on to play Dr. Greenbaum in Cruel Intentions (in both films, Valmont seduces her daughter), there's just something magical missing. I couldn't tell who was who in Dangerous Liasions, and Keanu Reeves, is infamously stiff in this. (Loosen up, man!) I just couldn't sit through it, and I always know when I start films or even books, I know I cannot sit through it.<br /><br />Unfortunately Dangerous Liasions is not for me, although I'm the only reviewer who seems to think this. Everyone else is raving about it. But you have to be really into the film, and be able to keep your eyes above chest height on the actresses.
B000069KE0|5.0|As a huge fan of Chicago's blistering acid jazz rock from 1969-1972 (Chicago Transit Authority through V), it is hard to select a favorite from this incredibly creative peak, although this 1970 album always seems to come up.<br /><br />I think that all of the albums from this period had distinct personalities and this one seemed to me to be the most classically influenced.  Of course, this was big band style jazz rock (with an emphasis on the rock), punctuated by Terry Kath's searing guitar work, and blasts from the horns, so using terms like classical to describe this music might be a bit of a stretch.  However, some of the pieces have classical overtones - the intro to Poem for the People and the obvious choice Prelude/AM Mourning/PM Mourning, which is a classical piece through and through (that borders on modern classical at points). There is also the presence of very sophisticated and lengthy multi-movement suites (Ballet for a Girl in Buchanan; It Better End Soon).  In fact, upon reading through the liner notes, it became clear to me that the guys were very interested in writing \\"serious\\" pieces that followed in the style of the famous classical composers - for example, Walter Pankow had been listening to Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, which inspired his beautiful piece Colour My World.  Certainly, efforts like these were being undertaken in England by a number of rock groups, yet with much different results.<br /><br />All of the guys in Chicago were incredible musicians and the ensemble work on the album Chicago (I am resisting the impulse to call this Chicago II, although that is what I used to think of it as) is just phenomenal.  The guys knew how to really COMPOSE a proper piece of music.  Counterpoint, melodies, harmonies, and the use of sophisticated meters are all used very well and make this album an extremely interesting listening experience.  The guys were great vocalists too and they used the differences in the texture of their voices very well - for example, Terry sang the heavier pieces, while Peter sang the \\"sweeter\\", more melodic songs etc.  The dynamic range is fairly broad too and ranges from the delicate acoustic textures of Prelude/AM Mourning/PM Mourning, through the spacey Hammond organ intro of Fancy Colours, to the blazing rock piece 25 or 6 to 4.  Then there is the use of instrumentation: great horn arrangements, searing electric guitar, Peter's fantastic bass playing (he is criminally underrated); Danny Seraphines great drumming...whew, this is great stuff.<br /><br />The remastering job by Rhino is fantastic and there are now a ton of liner notes and photos to go along with the original album art.  Although I do miss my old vinyl version of Chicago...II, this remastered version is of very high quality and has fantastic sound quality.<br /><br />All in all, this is an incredible album that contains music written by Chicago during their creative peak.  Very highly recommended along with Chicago Transit Authority (1969); Chicago III (1971); the live Chicago IV (1971); and Chicago V (1972).example, Terry sang the heavier pieces, while Peter sang the \\"sweeter\\", more melodic songs etc.  The dynamic range is fairly broad too and ranges from the delicate acoustic textures of Prelude/AM Mourning/PM Mourning, through the spacey Hammond organ intro of Fancy Colours, to the blazing rock piece 25 or 6 to 4.

B000IFQLLY|4.0|Definitively, not the product that a DM fan can expect for their money, but, they will buy one for shure. Every one of those songs are memories, past glories, influences, icons. Unfortunatelly there are not black celebration songs in it, but this is just the vol. 1.     DM has reached the top of their influential powers many years ago, but the media and the critics are opening their eyes for the first time since the Touring the angel global success, recongnizing DM as a legend in the music business, sharing their status with U2, Pink Floyd, The Stones, etc.     This collection is a must for you that want to meet those guys from Basildon, then you can build a basement to get the entire picture, and go for the next album (violator could be the next). And the bonus DVD is worth, all those oldies for the first time on DVD. Oh, and the new song is good, maybe not a classic, but is catchy and danceable.    This \\"Best of\\" is more like a marketing tool than a real \\"Best Of\\" (at least for the fans), but is fine to get all those significant songs in a new CD with new Anton's artwork.    For you, the fans, c'mon go and get it, you and me know it, earlier or later we will.
B000IOM1RI|5.0|yes.  yes.  YES.  tenacious d rocks even harder than on their last cd.  there's definately a true display of metal rocking power.  the talent is excellent, the harmonies are triumphant.  the devil was outrocked.  really now, who would know metal better than satan?  the d.  that's who.  and maybe testament.  but i don't think testament challenged satan to a rock off, so we might never know the outcome of that battle.  so the d.  get the d's cd.  it will make you happy.  i am over 13 years old, so i checked the 'i am over the age of 13' box.
B000J103X4|5.0|I'm a hip-hop fan and am pretty much neutral with all the beef going on with the Game and G-Unit. I really like Game's first album \\"The Documentary\\". I just heard this one and I have to say I am very pleased with what I heard. I love the \\"Compton\\" produced by will.i.am., it's a classic and I'm feelin' Game's flow and delivery on it. My favorite track is the one with Nas and the first track \\"Lookin' At You\\". There's alot of hype on this album and i have to say the album lives up to that hype. Dr. Dre is no where on the production side of things, but I feel it doesn't lack production at all with producers like Kanye & Just Blaze. The only bad thing about the album is the name dropping but besides that I can live with it :).
B000J103X4|5.0|simply put this album is going to go down as a classic.  Gone are the pop influences of G-unit, and although it lacks dre beats it suffers very little from it.  The title track, doctor's advocate, shows the game is a gifted lyricist, and while the rest of the album isn't as deep, it showcases his west coast flow.   I can promise you this will rule the billboard charts, it is both catchy and unique, and the west coast is back with this great sophmore lp from game.
B000J103X4|5.0|I think the best way to describe Game is immature. While I think that G-Unit makes some of the worst rap on the market, and I pretty much refuse to listen to anything 50 Cent makes these days, even I thought the \\"G-unot\\" thing was a little overboard. He was really proud of himself for coming up with that, wasn't he? In any case, he also comes across as immature in interviews. You can read two interviews with two identical questions and Game will give polar oppostire answers. You can tell that all he wants to do is make waves, and that he doesn't really know who he is yet. In short, I'm not a huge fan of Game the person. Game the rapper is another story all together.    In short, this album is hot. How hot? Well, I've now heard both Kingdom Come, and Doctor's Advocate and I honestly don't know which is better. Game loves to call himself a living legend, and he may not be that far off. If his goal was to show that he can be great without a 50 Cent hook or without a Dre beat, then he certainly succeeded. He still name drops like nothing, but hey, if I was chill with Nas...I'd mention it too.     There's a great deal of versatility in his tracks. \\"Wouldn't get far\\" with Kanye West is an ode to the music video girl, while the title track is a confession to Dre himself, and California Vacation is just...amazing. He has the benefit of some of the hottest beatmakers as well, the beat on Scream on 'Em is one of the best I've heard all year. One Blood continues to be one of my favorite tracks and Why You Hate the Game with Nas is fire (though, far too drawn out, I think he tried to capture the magic of \\"We Major\\" and came up a lil short).     In the end, there is no sophomore slump here and Game is truly bringin back the West Coast. Man, the guy even managed to resurrect Ja Rule on that insane One Blood Remix. He's cocky, arrogrant, and childish, but dude can rap...hip hop ain't dead yet.
B000H305U0|3.0|This album is good, and like other people note, much better than what we have come to expect from the former teenie-bopper.  The beats are mostely original and interesting, however this album has quite a few weak songs. \\"chop me up\\" is just awkward, the last three songs are all less than steller because lets face it, he can sing but he just doesn't do the whole soul thing so well.  On the upside, this album has some great dance/club songs, and justin can still make a hit.  So if that's what you are into, grab this CD, and stop listening to it when you get to the end.  If you are interested in a trendy, new approach to R&B, check out Robin Thicke.
B0001XAPZ6|1.0|I own \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" amd \\"Spirited Away\\" by Miyazaki and bought \\"Nausicaa\\" mainly because of the customer reviews.<br /><br />\\"One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made.\\"<br /><br />\\"Greatest Animated Film of All Time.\\"<br /><br />\\"Best Movie I've Ever Seen.\\"<br /><br />Please help me!<br /><br />This film story is about a young female heroine (who can't afford underpants) with a good heart and a desire to stop all killing in a future world dominated by giant worms. And a worm is a perfect mascot for the tedious, snail crawling pace of this film (everyone viewing almost fell asleep). The plot is slow to develop, character development lacking and animation primitive at best. Of the three Miyazaki films I own, this is the worst. Does it matter who wrote the screenplay? When you put your name on it, it's yours. \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" and \\"Spirited Away\\" (which won an Academy Award) have qualities that are totally lacking in this film. These films had characters who's evolution touched my heart, a storyline which captivated me and animation that made me forget that this was animation. Not so with \\"Nausicaa\\".<br /><br />The reviewer who claimed that this is \\"One of the Best Films of Any Type Ever Made\\". has obviously never seen \\"Gone With the Wind\\", \\"Ten Commandments\\", \\"Ben Hur\\" or even \\"The Wizard of Oz\\".<br /><br />The reviewer who stated that this is \\"The Greatest Animated Film of All Time.\\" has probably never seen \\"Dumbo\\", Pinocchio\\" or the new \\"Over the Hedge\\" or \\"Open Season\\" (the animation of the bear fur is beyond realistic).<br /><br />So if you're an animation freak like I am (and not someone who's been paid by Miyazaki to praise his inferior work), who lets the eyes and heart decide what's a good film and if you want good Miyazaki film, pass on this one. If you want great animation, buy \\"Dumbo\\" or \\"Pinocchio\\". And if you want great films, buy any of the classics like the four movies mentioned before or \\"King Kong\\", \\"Godzilla\\" or any of the other top 100 films listed by the American Film Institute.<br /><br />\\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\", so don't let the myopic vision of reviewers blind you to a bad movie choice made by people who really don't get out much.<br /><br />PS Used \\"Nausicaa\\" for sale or trade.100 films listed by the American Film Institute.<br /><br />\\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder\\", so don't let the myopic vision of reviewers blind you to a bad movie choice made by people who really don't get out much.<br /><br />PS Used \\"Nausicaa\\" for sale or trade.
B00014TJ7K|4.0|What a fine album this one is.  One of Harrison's best.  \\"Cloud Nine\\", \\"This Is Love\\" and \\"When We Was Fab\\" are some of George's best work.  \\"Got My Mind Set On You\\" is a really strong song but it got a little over-played at the time.  The best of the second tier is \\"That's What It Takes\\".  You better believe this CD is a buy.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|I consider this to be the best movie that I have seen this year. Highly recommend!
B00005UKE0|4.0|OK.  This is a great and classic Harrison album.  Disc 1 has \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", \\"What Is Life\\" and a little gem called \\"I Live For You\\".  Disc 2 has \\"Beware of Darkness\\", a quiter version of \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" that I like very much, and a couple of slam-bang kick-down jams like \\"Plug Me In\\" and \\"I Remember Jeep\\".  Can you imagine this group just sitting around jamming?  A great buy.
0618918248|1.0|If you took Critical thinking and logic classes in community college, you would escape the self-delusional 'arguments' of notorious sophist and science fiction writer - Dicky Dawkins.  If you took intro to philosophy (which Dawkins apparently never took) you would know classic arguments for and contra existence of God, and would NEVER say such ignorant things as Dicky says.  It's so funny, Dawkins expects clergy to turn atheist after reading this book. :D this is truly funny, in light of the fact that his book should be used as an example of how NOT to argue.   Honestly, this poor man looks like a somewhat proud child. Proud enough not to read homework, but jump right into argumentations ad debates. And this is where he looks embarrassing. In order to argue against some particular position, one has to learn something about this position. But, when a guy is trying to convert clergy and intellectual Christians,... man, he better do his homework. But, Dawkins thinks he doesn't need to. He read Hume's comment on 'books of metaphysics' and the need to throw them away, etc. and story about naked king (in Dawkins' mind - theist), while he is the one who points out that the king is naked without invisible clothes. But what if the case is vice versa?     This is rather dishonest to think the guy who is PROUD(or lazy) enough not to read and study Christian Theology before arguing against it deserves respect.  This is rather naive to think the guy who canNOT communicate logically can overturn believers into nonbelievers.    Dawkins' book is reaffirmation to atheists and mockery for thinking theists.
B000H7JCG4|2.0|As a someone who grew up watching this show and remembers every single song that was used in the background or as a part of a story I was very dissapointed to see that almost every song was replaced. I knew that those replacements couldn't match the original songs but still I was hoping for decent replacements since the same team did replacements as did the originals. But the replacements are terrible and it looks like they were thrown without any consideration let alone with any kind of heart and soul the originals had. They even changed theme song in the pilot and in the first episode, in the pilot they used the theme from the second season.  <br /> <br />The picture quality is very poor, it looks like it wasn't remastered because there are a lot of much older movies and series with much better quality.  <br /> <br />Considering the fact that we waited for years for this to come to DVD the waiting was not worth it. <br /> <br />Again, since the music is an important part of this series, I would waited longer and payed more to get the original series, and not this bad try of it. <br /> <br />That said, the series has not lost it's original charm and it's a shame that it got sucha bad DVD edition.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|\\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is one of the greatest dark-comedy anti-war films ever produced. I remember when I was assigned to SAC [Strategic Air Command] for nearly two years, that our motto \\"Peace Is Our Profession\\" seemed a bit odd. As did others in my unit. Both at the time, and looking back many years later; while I protected Nuclear Weapons Convoys from the air in a helicopter as a machine gunner, I thought how horrible the world would have been had these weapons ever been unleashed. Thankfully the Officers and NCO's I served with did not have the same mentality that the film depicts with these characters. This film is without a doubt one of the greatest dark-comedies ever made. I don't know how many times I have seen this film, yet I always find it hilarious. And a bit scary too!<br /><br />Peter Sellers and George C. Scott are just terrific. Stanley Kubrick made a film that will be seen for generations to come. The social satire of the film must have been something when it was released in the early 1960s. The character I found most hilarious in the film was that of the late actor George C. Scott. His portrayal as the militaristic General, who seems not to have too much of a problem with the B-52 launching directed towards Soviet Russia, must have come straight out of a chapter from former General Curtis Lemay. Now that was one dangerous general. Also, Sterling Hayden's portrayal as the rogue general who sets off these chain of events gave a stellar performance. I know most people remember the role of Slim Pickens riding off as a cowboy on his missile, but for me the most memorable scenes dealt with George C. Scott. He was just outstanding in his role.<br /><br />And Peter Sellers' multiple roles were just great. I thought that his portrayal of the president was hilarious, and he reminded me a lot of former Senator Adlai Stevenson. At least I got that impression from his acting performance while he is trying to divert a Nuclear holocaust while he is in the war room. Since I was around these weapons many times, and knowing that these weapons are still around, with their awesome destructive power they can unleash at anytime, still makes one think about these weapons: Especially at the height of the Cold War. Audiences must have had a huge laugh with this one. My mother tells me that when my father took her to the theatre to view the film; people were either hysterical with laughter, or left the theatre upset. Wish I could have seen it. I don't know anyone who either does not like this film, or does not have this in either DVD or VHS. This is one DVD that belongs in your collection. For those who are younger, and have never viewed this great dark-comedy, rent it some night when you're not doing anything, and you'll get a great laugh out of it. Highly recommended.

B000EOTAM6|3.0|I have a long history of liking trashy movies that other reviewers pillory, for example I love the Resident Evil series. So I was looking forward to Aeon Flux as I still have fond memories of the anarchic blood splattered cartoon series and the cast list boded well. Unfortunately it doesn't really deliver, it's indisputably very stylish with some nice touches, some of the advanced biotech is neat. But it's also extremely clinical with most of the fight scenes being choreographed to death, they're clever, balletic even, but also devoid of any spontaneity and just plain lacking in excitement.  <br />It also suffers from a few whacking great big plot holes and as protagonists, despite all their hi tech wizardry, the Monicans must remain some of the dumbest people in creation. There's a coup in progress, the target has been deposed and their top agent has discovered that something weird is going on. Yet they don't have the common sense to pause and reconsider their strategy, they just add their own agent to the hit list, no questions asked. <br />An example of the plot inconsistencies is the death of Una Flux, according to the theory when an adult dies a clone is created, implanted and nine months later born to it's surrogate mother. Yet Aeon was able to hold the new-born version of Una within hours of the adult being exterminated, must be the shortest gestation period in human history. <br />We're also expected to swallow the theory that the dedicated genetic science supremo leader of this utopia is completely oblivious to his idiot younger brother killing off an entire test group. A less observant scientist would be hard to imagine. <br />Overall, it's not a particularly bad movie. It definitely scores on the eye candy front and isn't even particularly dumb. But when you consider the energy and sheer fun that the cartoon had, the live action movie is curiously torpid. Not a disaster, but it's not going to be on many peoples top ten list.
B000J103X4|5.0|Game Did His Thing On This One Without The Help Of 50 And Dre. Beats Are Crazy He Steped Up His Lyrics From Documentary and Str8 Dropped A Classic That Will be Talked About A Long Time.1-16 Solid Tracks. Not Really Feelin The Jamie Foxx Track, But Other Than That THE BOMB. This Is A Great Album Support The Dude And Pick This Up.     !!!GAME TIME!!!
B000J103X4|4.0|The Game's new album, The Doctor's Advocate, despite not having any Dr. Dre production, is a great second effort from the self proclaimed savior of West Coast Rap. Game got laced with some really great beats from Will.I.Am, Scott Stourch, Just Blaze, Kanye, Jelly Roll, Hi-Tek, and others. Game also steps up his lyrical game on this LP, there seems to be less name dropping on this album then there is on The DOcumentary. Though there is still to much name dropping for my taste, it's done in  manner that it's not as appearnent as with the Documentary. Game also has a much better flow on this album and much better content in my opinion. Game also has some steller guest appearences on this album including: Nas, Busta, Snoop, and Kanye...not one guest has a bad verse. Overall, The Game's new album is more then worth the purchase, it's still premature to say if it's the best rap album of the year because of all the ill albums coming out in the later days of November and the entire month of December, but as of right now Game is easily the front runner for Album of the Year.
B000J103X4|3.0|Being from the west coast, I love how game and DPG and Snoop and the Bay is trying to make a West Coast resurrection. After listening to this cd, I Felt the Game went with a \\"if it ain't broke don't fix it\\" method. At first his songs felt like extra tracks off his first album. I can't lie it was a little played out,boring and he's still talking about other rappers. and i don't know about ya'll, but his flow is better, his voice a little more demanding like who? Dr. Dre. I had to look at the cd tracklisting again sometimes because I thought I heard his voice. But it sounds good though. <br /> <br />On the other hand he makes better songs when he talks about his pain, as most people do. Game spoke about the breakup with Aftermath almost like the last drunk song on his first LP, except this time Busta Rhymes has something to say to Dre as well. you can feel it was real talk in comparison to his other songs. <br />Beat wise, I felt Scott Storch let me down. Hi-Tek came through and so did Jellyroll. Just blaze did his thing too. the Swizz beats was alright.. but nottz and other not too known producers represented well.  <br />Over all its a decent effort, started weak, finished strong, his features did well too  <br />*standouts* <br /> <br />2. da S*** (by DJ Khalil <br />3.it's okay/one blood (by Reefa) <br />9.scream on 'em (by swizz beatz) <br />10.one night (by nottz) <br />12.Ol' English (by Hi-Tek) <br />13.California Vacation f/ Xzibit, Snoop( by JR) <br />14.

B00004TJTS|4.0|Alot of good messages and themes.  Enjoyed as an adult.  Kinda sad content for kids.
032147404X|5.0|It is short and to the point. Who has time to read 700 page books? I don't. I just want the info I need and I want it immediately. The less time you spend reading the more time you can be taking pictures. You can browse through the book looking at the photos and if one really catches your eye you can learn how to take a pic just like it in a few minutes! No fluff, no long winded explanations, just the right amount of info you need. The book is small so you can put it in your camera bag and refer to it while you are shooting. This is one of the best books on photography I have purchased. It's a lot of useful information in very little space!
B000I5X81K|3.0|First off, I want to say that I am a big Josh Groban fan, but I must admit I was a bit disappointed with this CD.  While there are certainly some decent songs on this cd, they are, overall, mediocre by comparison to the songs on JOSH GROBAN and CLOSER: \\"You are Loved\\" is a decent, but doesn't compare to the richness of \\"Remember When it Rained\\". I find myself listening to \\"In her Eyes\\" over and over again, and I like \\"Now or Never,\\" but despite the fact that I enjoy these songs, I still feel like his previous offerings are superior to this one.  <br /> <br />Aside from inferior song choices, I feel that his voice was a bit strained in places or too straight-forward where a bit more soul would have been appropriate, like in \\"Weeping\\".   <br /> <br />I think my biggest gripe is that the songs just don't mesh well with each other.  In some places they downright clash.  Perhaps it would have worked better if the more classical-sounding songs were on one cd and the more new-age-sounding songs were on another, ala Ben Harper's Both Sides of the Gun.   <br /> <br />Overall, though, I would buy this CD again, but I would skip the internet only edition.  The bonus tracks are nothing to double the price over, not like they were with CLOSER, anyway.
B000J103X4|5.0|I've been following Game's career since the beginning. I have never heard a rapper before that continuelly delivers music better and better each time. Every great rapper has had no respect during the beginning of their careers. A lot of people used to talk a lot of smack about Jay Z and now he's great. People jumped Tupac and tried to kill him twice and now he's great. I see the same thing happening to Game. The only difference is his work ethics. Game can do anything with the mic and in front of millions of people without any struggle. He is what you call a true MC. He is not dull, boring, or predictable. He is the only celebirty that reaches out to his fans. He reaches out so much that if I were to see him he would be like one of the homies. I couldn't say that about Nas or Eminem. He says everything the way it should be said. And no one comes close to him when it comes to talking trash. He's put out so much material some of his old raps would sound new to you. He made mixtapes mainstream and won many rap battles. He not only brought back the west coast but set new standards. He motivated every rapper on the west coast to step up their game. This is only the beginning of his career and he has a lot more to prove. I rate this album a classic and thats how it stands. <br />Ric Q #1 Rap Fan Known 2 Man
B0000029AL|5.0|I'm waiting for a band with the bravado to re-release an album as their \\"best of\\".  Aerosmith would certainly be a candidate for such a display.  I'm not saying that there isn't a gem here and there after the debut album, but this is the most interesting sound that the band has in their career.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I really enjoyed this DVD.  It was sent through the postal system in very guickly.  Thanks,
B000H305U0|4.0|Bought this cd  when it came out.  His sound was totally diffrent from his 1st solo cd. It took a little time to grow on me . I didn't even like \\"sexy back \\" When I heard the frist time. But after a while , i liked it. I love \\" love stoned \\" and \\" my love.  Can't wait to see him on tour. Overall  he suprised me . Didn't think he could pull this off.
B000IU3Y1O|5.0|Been a fan of Depeche Mode for 22 years? Got every scrap of stuff they've ever made? Even all the singles individualy and in box sets? Then you'd expect me to say you don't need this, right? Well, wrong, I love Depeche Mode a lot, and I'm a completionist, so I had to have this. And, this version includes a dvd with the videos to go with the songs, as well as a little documentary, and the new song Martyr. I have gone along with this band, even though I still suffer from Alan Wilder leaving, even if they don't want to include the video for Get the Balance Right anywhere, and even after seeing the \\"video\\" for Martyr.  Despite the fact that this compilation might seem like overkill in a year where we've had singel releases, 6 remasters and a live from Milano dvd, I'm really happy with this set, both in terms of the look and what you get with it. But would I have bought it without the DVD? Probably... I guess I'm a fan.
B000I5X80G|1.0|How many times does this guy expect us to buy the same 10 songs over and over again? I even bought \\"Road Rock,\\" and I said to myself at the time, \\"Do I really need another 20-minute version of 'Cowgirl in the Sand'?\\" I didn't, but I bought it anyway. Then there it was on the so-called \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. I passed. Now, finally, a release from the 15-year-delayed Archives series -- and it's another 65 minutes of \\"Cowgirl.\\"  <br /> <br />Neil Young is sitting on a minimum of 50 unreleased songs, a handful of which surpass anything he's ever released. I've given up on ever hearing an official version of \\"Ordinary People.\\" And I fear we haven't heard the last \\"Cowgirl\\" or \\"Down by the River.\\" Or \\"Like a Hurricane.\\" Or \\"Needle and the ...\\"

B000BHHVPO|5.0|Several other reviewers have put their lists of what these 4 DVD's contained. I won't do the same. I will however share my thoughts of the concerts and why I purchased this concert in its entirity.<br /><br />I watched the beginning of several of the European concerts (London, Paris, Rome) on AOL Broadband and realised the cause of these concerts. It was indeed a day when the world came together with one aim, to listen to good music and tell our world leaders with one loud voice that poverty has to be eradicated. It was a successful day. We were entertained by the best music artists as well as listened to stories from Africa and watched pictures of famine and its effects in Europe. Bob Geldof the producer of these concerts never lost the realisation of what we were here for.<br /><br />July 2nd 2005 stands for all time as the day we spoke with one voice \\"Let's get rid of Poverty\\". I purchased this compilation because it was for a good cause and that it had some great music from a few of my favourite bands and solo artists.<br /><br />I recommend this album for any LIVE music fan.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|Season third opened with Lorelei recovering from her brief relationship with Christopher and Rory's senior year.

Lorelei and Sookie finally buy the Dragonfly at the end of the season.
0618680004|1.0|I am not a religious person, although I consider myself spiritual, I don't have a very high opinion of organized religion. What bothers me is the hypocrisy of this book. It was lent to me by an atheist friend of mine to \\"learn the truth\\".<br /><br />This book is not full of \\"truth\\" - it's full of an atheistic fundamentalist violently advocating elimination of the right to think freely, that is, the right to disagree with him. The only way I can see positive reviews for this book happening are if they are written by people who espouse his extremist and fundamentalist viewpoints. Which is frightening to say the least.<br /><br />Although I dislike Christianity as a religion, I do recall Jesus once saying something that is very true - that one should look for the log in one's own eye before pointing out the splinter in another. Many atheists simply refuse to comprehend that perhaps they are practicing the same form of hate and intolerance for their fellow human that those that they criticize are.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is easily the best show on t.v. Gilmore Girls is smart, quick and witty. The first ep. began with an  real plot. Lorelei and Rory Gilmore are mother and daughter and best friends and coffee lovers. when Rory gets into Chilton Lorelei has to turn to her wealthy parents to pay for the school whom she's worked hard to keep out of her life.  They agree to pay for Chilton but Lorelei and Rory must attend Friday night dinners in exchange for the money. Lorelei has a very strain relationship with her parents and you can actually see each charactor's point of view and understand where their coming from.  The entire cast is really amazing from Sookie, Luke and Michel to Paris, Richard and Emily. The town of Stars Hollow is a corky small town. Rory's smart, bookish and loves school which was a real change from most teenagers on TV. She has a goal to go to Harvard and her mother's determind to make that happen. Rory gets her first boyfriend in Dean while Lorelei dates one of Rory's teacher Max despite her attraction to diner owner Luke Danes. The writting is incredable from the hilarious jokes to the hundreds of references to movies, music and other stuff. I love how they don't dumb down the script with obvious references some of them are really obscure. There's so many wonderful scenes and funny lines I could never list them all.
B000J103X4|4.0|There is only one way to really judge this album. Forget about all the beef with 50, Dr Dre, and other drama he has been in. If you listen to it with a clear head, then you will find that this is a good CD. I think song for song, this CD is just as good as his 1st if not better. If Game would stop being an NWA cheerleader and stop trying to address EVERY negative comment ever spoken about him, then he will be one of the top 5 MC's in hip hop. This is without a doubt one of the better CD's I've heard this year. I say enjoy the music and entertainment and let these guys handle their beefs on their own.

0763627410|5.0|I purchased this for my 2 yr old who A) loves Maisy the Mouse B) loves fish - so it was a no brainer!  I found the book actually doing a search on Maisy and bought it on a whim. WE LOVE THIS BOOK!  The illustrations are fantastic - bold, vibrant colors on a bigger than normal sized book.  And the story is very sweet.  Worth every penny and definitely a must for your children's book collection.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Rarely does music come by so raw and emotional these days.    Damien Rice has gathered a musical following with his debut album \\"O\\" much larger than any of us can comprehend. While he is definitely no mainstream artist, his music has spread far and wide to entrance music lovers the world over. Perhaps his big break came about when his famous, famous song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" was featured on Mike Nichol's \\"Closer\\". But then again with talent such as Rice's, recognition and appreciation for his music was just a matter of time.     \\"O\\" awed and inspired me. The music felt organic, uplifting and it was so very good. Fellow fans of Rice's, I'm glad to say the same of \\"9\\" (although, I must urge you potential buyers out there NOT to compare, ESPECIALLY to \\"O\\", which I am already guilty off; despite the fact that we as humans are so good at doing just that - my plead: take \\"9\\" for what it is - for \\"O\\" is immortal, you see).     While \\"9\\" as an album is very similar to \\"O\\", in some ways it is completely different. \\"O\\" was quietly thoughtful, vocally reserved and musically stripped down. \\"9\\" on the other hand showcases louder instrumentation, fiercer music and is certainly more vocal - both technically and lyrically. On \\"9\\" Rice shows off a much improved falsetto together with better control of his voice (hear \\"Elephant\\"). While \\"O\\" felt much like an introspective folk record, \\"9\\" falls squarely in the alternative genre, leaning towards rock.     For some reason Damien Rice seems to have unleashed his anger on this sophomore release. And heaps of it. On track 7, \\"Me, My Yoke and I\\", the distorted guitar riffs are amped way up, and Rice shouts (yes, shout) at us. It's disturbing, and perhaps something that some of us would never have expected of Rice. But it's a stand out; and it reminds me of angst-ridden tracks on the CDs of 90's female rock singer-songwriters such as Paula Cole, Alanis Morissette and Sarah McLachlan. Rice even takes it a step further by repeating \\"F**k you\\" three times in a row as part of the chorus on track 4 \\"Rootless Tree\\". I find myself singing along, and in a way, it's rather liberating.     But for those who fell in love with Rice's sugary sweet songs, rest assured there are still plenty of them on \\"9\\". First single \\"9 Crimes\\" (a piano driven ballad in which Damien Rice splits vocal duties with Lisa Hannigan), \\"Accidental Babies\\" (also piano heavy), \\"The Animals Were Gone\\" and \\"Sleep Don't Weep\\" (both acoustic guitar based) are thoughtful, reflective and extremely beautiful. My pick as best track (mind you, they're all favourites) from \\"9\\" would have to be \\"Elephant\\". This song starts off mellow and builds up into a crescendo that just lifts you. The vocals are excellent.    \\"9\\" is slickly produced and flawlessly recorded, except for a weird sonic emptiness on track 10 that goes on for about 15 minutes (what's with that?). The sound is crisp, accentuating the instruments and Rice's voice. I only have 2 complaints: First, 10 tracks is a bit too little. Second, perhaps a booklet with lyrics and more art would be a great accompaniment to this great CD. I guess we'll just have to wait for the next Rice CD (possibly titled \\"8\\"?).     The experience you get listening to \\"9\\" is like you're standing on top of the world, looking down on the wondrous vastness of it all, and thinking, \\"The world's a miracle; but the you know what? To be a part of it is the most miraculous of it all\\". That's how it feels to be able to listen to Damien Rice's music.    So yeah, you should buy \\"9\\" and feel it yourself.

B000IU3XTM|4.0|If you were to ask me which song on this album is my favorite, I would give you reasons as to why any of these songs at any given time could be my favorite.  I know I'm one of the few who likes this album better than O, but I do, and I'm not going to apologize for it.<br />Everyone can say that 9 isn't as daring, or it's not as complex, or the songs on 9 are friendlier, but you can not say that he does not sing his heart out on any song he records.  He pours every ounce of his soul into these songs and because of that he is giving Dylan and The Decemberists solid competition for album of the year.
B000I5X80G|5.0|I'm a long time Neil fan and I'm pleased with the release.  These reviews aren't to address what wasn't put on the album but what was and the material that is on this release is fantastic.  The band is in top form and the sound quality is 20x better than any Neil bootleg from 1970 and I've got a ton of them.  The album is short but so what.  Some of the greatest albums ever released were under 45 minutes long: Jimi Hendrix's Axis: Bold as Love, just about every Led Zeppelin album except for Physical Graffiti, CSN&Y Deja Vu, Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, Blind Faith, etc. It's not all in the minutes and seconds....
B000FP2OPY|5.0|The first season of Supernatural was a breath of fresh air in my life. <br />With all the shows currently on tv, this one was a shiny little star on what television does best. <br />This one is a must have on the bookshelf. Everyone should have it!
B00005JNS0|5.0|My son and I watched Cars on the big screen and I LOVED it! The songs were perfect--especially Real Gone and Life is a Highway.<br /><br />I've just watched the movie again, twice, on DVD. Unfortunately, my 25 inch TV screen doesn't do this movie justice! (It's one of those movies that pack a wallop when watched on the big screen...)<br /><br />The realism achieved in this movie is amazing, especially with Lightning's shiny red paint job and the \\"fumes\\" rising from the drag cars. The writing is especially clever, too. (Look for the shapes in the rocky background at Radiator Springs.) For example, Harv, Lightning's fast-talking publicist/agent admonishes his client to get out of \\"Radiation Stinks\\" (you gotta hear it to appreciate it.)<br /><br />Every single time I watch this movie, I choke up twice during the last race. There are some critics who say that Cars doesn't have \\"heart\\" like Toy Story or other Pixar features. I can't help but wonder if we're talking about the same movie! I feel that Cars has more heart than ANY Pixar movie thus far--especially as it shows that winning isn't everything and that dignity is found in much more than an \\"empty cup\\" (like the Piston Cup).<br /><br />The voices in this movie are perfect, especially Owen Wilson as Lightning and Larry the Cable Guy as Mater. (Gosh, what a scene stealer that Mater is! And the funny thing is, if you watch the 16-minute \\"Inspiration for Cars\\" clip, you'll see the actual Mater--who sounds a lot like the character!)<br /><br />Speaking of the 16 minute Inspiration clip, I'm surprised that this DVD didn't have more extras--not even a commentary or movie video or sample story boards or anything! That was a disappointment, I admit. (I'm used to Disney packing the extras on there! Heck, I found out neat trivia bits--like why number 96 was chosen for Lightning's car--but I didn't find this out from the DVD!)<br /><br />However, the 16-minute clip was quite touching, especially hearing how the director was inspired for Cars. Turns out that he has several boys and his wife said to him one day: \\"You know, we supported you through Toy Story 1 and 2 and your other projects...but one day, you'll wake up to find that your little boys are now off to college.\\"<br /><br />This sobering realization spurred him to take an entire summer off with his wife and kids--a road trip in a motor home. He said it was the best time of his life. Alas, he combined the two loves of his parents (his mother was an artist and his Dad was a car buff) to create the wonderful movie Cars, which also reflects his newfound wisdom: you can push, push, push for that next accomplishment, and one day realize that you're friendless or perhaps alone.<br /><br />There's also some great laughs in this movie; I LOVE the tractor-tipping scene with Mater and Lightning! (OMG--and that Frank is scary!)<br /><br />As I said, the extras are slim pickins:<br /><br />--New animated short Mater and the Ghostlight (Amusing. Fans of Mater will *especially* love this short!)<br /><br />--Academy Award-nominated animated short: One Man Band (This was the cute short about two deuling musicians fighting for a coin that a girl wants to throw into a fountain. It's the same short shown at the theater before the Cars movie.)<br /><br />--John Lasseter's inspiration for Cars (Very good. Inspirational in its own right.)<br /><br />--Ratatouille teaser trailer (A movie about a mouse in France with expensive tastes)<br /><br />--Deleted scenes<br /><br />This is an exceptional movie in terms of script, voice acting, music, authenticity, and animation. Car and racing lovers will no doubt love it, as will fans of Pixar. (Personally, I can't STAND car racing--or country music--but I loved both the soundtrack and the plot!

B000FQ4M58|4.0|Let me preface this review with the fact that I'm 26 and have been a Meat Loaf fan for 12 almost 13 years, and subsequently Jim Steinman fan. My first album of Meat Loaf's was Bat II and I loved it, soon followed by Bat I - loved it also, and all the rest of the albums in-between, as well as the albums that followed after Bat II and before this one. Varying between \\"It's Ok\\", and loving them. Back to this album. I've had it shortly -- Day of release -- and it is growing on me, but I have to say it significantly falls short of my prior anticipations for Bat III. The material is there, but it seems that in the Steinman material he's covering, Meat Loaf has lost the heart for it, or so it sounds to me. As another reviewer in the UK pointed out and I'll quote it here \\"shortened and deprived of any leering menace or power by Meat Loaf's almost paint-by-numbers delivery, as if he just can't bothered anymore. Check out Steinman's delivery of the second verse \\"you'll never get away from me!\\" in \\"Bad For Good\\" and compare it to Meat Loaf's passionless version. Steinman growls and sneers. Meat Loaf just goes through the motions.\\" I had so intently waited for Meat Loaf to cover \\"Bad For Good\\", but I'm sorely disappointed, to where I honestly prefer Jim's version -- at least it's passionate. As well as other tracks following the same suit, Celine Dion's \\"It's all Coming Back To Me Now\\", and Pandora's Box \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\" BOTH in my opinion, have done MUCH better justice to the songs. That being said this is NOT A BAD ALBUM. \\"Alive\\", \\"What About Love\\", \\"Seize The Night\\" stand out as my favorites (\\"Seize The Night\\" is however a Steinman song). With the others being ok. And whoever mixed in horns -- Trombone/Trumpet/French Horn's whatever -- in \\"If It Ain't Broke Fix It\\" just ruined a song with them, in my opinion. Summing it all up. It's a Meat Loaf album, and a pleasant listen, but it does not have the sound and quality of either Bat I, or II, although withsome effort it could have had the potential.
B000IU3XU6|5.0|I didn't think it was possible, but I think Josh's voice has gotten even better.  There is more complexity and maturity to it.  His range is unbelievable, but that has always been true.  Let's face it, this is a guy who could sing the phone book and it would probably be beautiful.  While there will be some songs I am not as nuts about on this album, that has been true of every album - and I would still take a Josh Groban song that is not one of my favorites OF HIS over almost anyone and anything else.  And this is also no exception. <br /> <br />This time around, he picked some of a very different styles to mix in with the classic style he does best.  Some of the songs seem to me to be more vocally complex and technically challenging - and some are not.  This is perhaps a much more diverse album, so there will be more for people to both like and dislike.  It all comes down to the voice - you simply cannot beat it no matter what he sings.  And I'm thrilled that there are two Spanish songs - I think he does that even better than Italian. <br /> <br />I agree with the reviewer who said that it is wonderful that Josh continues to try to push and stretch himself rather than just staying within his comfort zone.  Three wonderful albums and not yet 30 years old!  Imagine what we have to look forward to!  Bravo Josh!  But, lets not go three years for the next one, okay?  :)  Can't wait for the tour!
B000H30B2C|4.0|The biggest problem most people had with King Kong was its length, so there's no surprise that reaction by the general public to the release of an extended edition of another 3 hour-plus Peter Jackson film was almost the equivalent of a collective groan. <br /> <br />The surprise is that everything added to the Extended Edition of King Kong should have never been cut. More dinosaurs and more creatures and more action on Skull Island only improves the film, and one wonders if these scenes were cut mostly for time and pacing, why wasn't a little bit of the 51 minutes of pre-Skull Island snipped or perhaps a few overly drawn scenes of Kong and Anna gazing into each other's eyes?  <br /> <br />The more noticable scenes are that of a rampaging Ceratops and a fun scene of an underwater monster attacking Adrien Brody and Co. while they are rafting down a river. A bit more character development with some seedy behavior by Carl Denham (Jack Black) and heroic deeds by Jack Driscoll and the shipmates add a bit of flavor to the male characters literally overshadowed by Kong in the film. The spider pit sequence is also a bit lengthened with some more lines by Jack Black. Overall, a worthy 13 minutes of added material, but the film still feels too long in the last act.  <br /> <br />The special features to this extended edition are the special features that were missing from the first release of the Kong movie, including a commentary from Peter Jackson and extensive behind the scenes features, describing the making of Kong from concept artwork to the screen a la the performance of Andy Serkis. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the extended cut, but I don't know that this lengthy movie is better served with added material. It's not like the LOTR films where the additions enhance your viewing and understanding of Tolkien's world. But hey, I am not going to complain about more dinosaurs and the raft sequence I was disappointed was missing from the original cut.
B000I5X80G|4.0|The performances are excellent and include three of the finest tracks from one of Neil's finest albums Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere, the Whitten penned \\"Come on Baby Let's Go Downtown\\" (which appeared on Tonight's the Night in another form) and two other tracks. All in all it is 6 tracks. They are great tracks and are performed with great intensity and as usual, Neil has proven himself among the best at performing his studio classica live... but I was confused, as another reveiwer was, that this was labeled archive release 2, when I had thought it was the first, thought a DVD double disc format was coming out (both of these I may have been ill-informed on), but this final point I am sure of, this was not the entire concert, and from what i have heard, other portions of the concert were good enough to merit making it to disc. I am a Neil diehard though and obviously every other release of this nature will become a valued part of my collection... someone earlier stated that \\"This is a no brainer, any Neil Young fan should buy Harvest.\\" hmmm, A Neil Young fan likely purchased that first if they go into him at or after it's release whether it deserves first purchase or not, but anyway I stray from my point... this is a fine disc, but it is certainly not an introduction to Neil and is more for long established more serious Young fans that have most of his other work already or were huge fans of his earlier work with Crazy Horse.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh has found himself & is doing what he loves! If he only caters to what his public wants, he will be missing out on his love and taste of music. I am sure he will acquire many new fans now. Heck, I may not even be able to afford his tickets! If you saw the DVD that accompanies the CD, you will see that Josh even said it may turn off some people but maybe others will come along for the ride. I admit that I wanted more of his operatic sound but the album is amazing. I will support this down to earth wonder no matter if he sings the ABC's! This is the first performer that has ever had me sending messages to my phone as to his album release date and appearances. I enjoy his dreamy sound. My favorite is Machine. It is so full of funk! I also love Verita and Solo Por Ti. Like I said, I have been grieving my father and continue to do so but this CD has helped me very much. Thank you Josh.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|My wife is the true Fan of Metallica's early days, but I was curious about the real-life behind the scenes of the making of their next album, ST Anger.  What immediately became known to me is the relationship between Lars and James.  James is very straight-foward in his approach to communication, but Lars speaks in riddles.  I can't understand what point he is trying to make many of the time and he goes on and on.  I thought it was absolutely hilarious to see a therapist so involved with a band during sessions and it became obvious to be that this guy was acting as a bridge between Lars and James.<br /><br />It was interesting to See James withdrawl into his family and his rehab which put the recording on Hiatus for 6 or so months.  When he came back to the fold and let it be known that he was only available 4 hours a day from 12 noon to 4, I thought this was ridulous.  Here is someone with Millions of dollars who just seems like he's had enough and wants to move on to family life which is a no-brainer, but receives a guilt trip from LARS.  The lifesyle of a rock group means that there will be unwanted temptations of sex and drugs and for James to continue with this type of music that Metallica is famous for by also trying to get himself better is B.S.  I just can't believe it, which puts most of this documentary into a bit of fiction for me.
B000IOM1RI|4.0|It's an excellent opening track, just for hearing Dio alone, but then it's another dozen or so before we encounter something that's longer than three minutes long, and the average length is two minutes. While nothing overstays its welcome, and Black's voice is still great, and the guitar work still graceful... so many of these songs are over before they get a chance to begin.<br /><br />There's a much wider variety of music on here, like they're spreading their wings, but when it gets brilliant it feels more accidental than inspired. I think \\"Master Exploder\\" is genius, but I enjoy it more for its artistic merits than because it rocks or is funny. I think the problem is that this album can't find a groove in between \\"rock n' roll with a sense of humor\\" and nearly Zappa-inspired antics.<br /><br />In the end, with its lack of cohesion, and the brevity of the album and most of the songs, I feel like I got a soundtrack with a couple bonus tracks.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|There are natural cycles and the sun is proven to be at a hotter stage at this time. Environmental propaganda is being used to hand over our National Parks to the United Nations. Think of the Democrats and Republicans as good cops and bad cops working for the Global Bankers -- their Masters. The Federal Reserve is a privately owned, International  Banking Cartel. We need to investigate the effect of the HAARP program based in Alaska on our ozone. Don't be fooled. Our government is holding secret meetings and signing paperwork to form the North American Union. They seek to combine Canada, Mexico and the United States. Say goodbye to the Dollar and hello to the Amero! Remind anyone of the Euro? Wake up folks. Our media is owned by five companies and they are not Watchdogs of Freedom. They are the Lapdogs of the Global Elite. Turn your eyes away from the truth and you doom your children to a future Police State, chip implants and tyranny from a remote, Global Government. Stop and think a moment. We are being enslaved through incrementalism. We can't even tie a piece of string to a stick and dip it into the ocean without a license. I recently went through a road block at 10am during the work week where they were arresting people and towing vehicles. Their purpose to stop me? To see my Driver's License. \\"YOUR PAPERS PLEASE!\\" Investigate the claims of this DVD and you'll see for the most part it is bunk! Buy and watch Aaron Russo's \\"America Freedom to Fascism\\" if you really want a valid cause to fight for. Buy and watch \\"Terrorstorm\\" by Alex Jones for even further clarity. Our Liberty and our children's Liberty is at stake.

0385333846|5.0|While living in the Haifa University dorms I developed the habit of checking a dozen books out of the library at a time and one of them was \\"Slaughterhouse five.\\"  Before reading \\"slaughterhouse five\\" I'd have laughed myself stupid if someone suggested I read ANY book cover to cover in one day but, yes...Vonnegut is that good.   <br />     I always read the blurbs before reading the introduction.  The blurbs for \\"Slughterhouse five\\" were so well executed that I figured the book must be \\"that good.\\"   <br />     Vonnegut starts with an introduction that reads like a post card to a friend and before you know it, the narrative kicks in and Vonnegut introduces timeless and structureless events that make sense in their timeless and structureless state but, when juxtaposed, give the story its substance, its kick, its juice.  There are no loose ends and no soggy and simple-minded moral to the story other than the one you manage to extrapolate. no unnecessary passages, characters, dialogue or even unnecesary words.  An airtight novel if there ever was one.         <br /> <br />     A treat for anyone with a penchant for the more twisted traits exclusive to the human species. The images of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that most people are familiar with can't even compare to the images of the fire bombed Dresden Vonnegut conjures up in my mind.  Raw and dead serious matter treated with a levity that draws chuckles in situations that would otherwise draw tears of blood.  For all who had their praise for Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. immortalized in blurb form we salute you.          <br />
0688145078|5.0|We read this book over and over to our 2 year old son when we were pregnant with his baby brother.  He could really relate to the story and it was a great way to explain things like why babies cry, why it's special to be the big brother, and how mommy and daddy still love the older child.  I highly recommend this book for small children that will be initiated into big brotherhood.
0679746048|5.0|Kaysen's memoir of her time spent in a psychiatric hospital is a very well done, very moving story.  It ranks with such classics as The Bell Jar, and it may very well surpass it.  The story is told in a series of vignettes that hops from character to character, sometimes focusing on herself, other times on the people she knew while she was in the hospital.  The book is unique in that it does not villify the nurses, or the \\"authorities,\\" and it neither glorifies nor puts down people with mental illness.  This may be the most well rounded and perfectly realized memoir of its kind.<br /><br />It differed from the movie in many ways.  The Lisa character was a funny person in the book, someone you would like to know.  While she did act out more than the others, she did not try to drag others down with her like the Jolie character from the movie.  The movie was also more of a straight narrative with a definite plot and a straightforward storyline.  In the book, there was no concept of time as the chapters flashed from the past before she ended up in the hospital to after she got released to the time she was in there.  It also hopped from character to character with no linear narrative.  It kind of makes you wonder how they came to base that movie on this book.<br /><br />I believe the book was the stronger of the two, although the movie was entertaining.  Kaysen is an interesting person and she has a very strong style of writing.  She makes important observations about the human mind and about the struggles involved in dealing with mental illness.  The short chapters and fast paced narrative made this impossible to put down.  I look forward to checking out her other books.
B000AYEL1A|4.0|I highly recommend the disc to Streisand fans who will relish Barbra's full-length film commentary, 16 minute of additional scenes (many previously unseen), and original wardrobe test footage.  Of course, the movie itself in all of its remastered Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack glory sounds and looks as vibrant and possibly even better than it played in cinemas.  The musical numbers and theatrical lighting are exceptional and features some truly classic Streisand singing on stage.  With the inclusion of Barbra's complete humming and acoustic guitar rendition of \\"Evergreen,\\" we finally have the opportunity to enjoy an otherwise unused musical number.  Even her commentary is enlightening, revealing that Kristofferson had a first shot at the song's lyrics but didn't submit them until just a few years ago when he sent Barbra a framed copy.  Among the deleted footage is Barbra applying lipstick to KK in the bathtub scene where she admits being comfortable enough with him from earlier years to forego anything covering her chest.  Indeed, she first met KK at L.A.'s Troubador club escorted by manager Marty Erlichman whose virtues she frequently praises in the commentaries.  In her discussion during the film Barbra recalls being certain she wanted to become a film director during A Star Is Born's shooting, as she often made suggestions to KK between takes and thought the movie's director Frank Pierson cut the camera prematurely.  After directing three films, Barbra recently declined ASIB producer Jon Peters's recent invitation to direct an upcoming ASIB remake.  Her commentary also details her music composing resume back to \\"Ma Premiere Chanson,\\" admitting that winning an Oscar for composing \\"Evergreen\\" is the biggest thrill of her career.  She wants to release another set of unreleased songs, including recordings made with Leon and Mary Russell in their home.  In the commentary Barbra identifies her antique clothes worn in the film and says \\"People look great in black...you listen to them better.\\"  Of course, her 2006 concert wardrobe is almost exclusively black.  She also engages in thoughtful analyses of the importance for her of being in the moment when capturing performances on film, especially her singing.  Barbra elaborates how choices were made for the film's finale and even calls attention to her runny nose quite candidly and humorously.  Concluding, she remembers ASIB as \\"a satisfying work experience,\\" and that's how I would describe this DVD, perhaps more than satisfying yet not completely satisfying.  Missing is the excellent Barbra: With One More Look At You TV program on the making of the movie, copies of which have circulated among fan-collectors for years.  The DVD would also be enhanced and appear more complete by a collection of photo stills, especially the famous Scavullo poster session, a staple on nearly all DVDs.  Including the original 4-minute theatrical trailer for ASIB as well as those for the previous two Star films with Garland and Gaynor is a nice touch.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Back after 6 years with a new album.  Beck's kickin' us into the stratosphere with some flux-infused, funk inducing, space-age, freaky hi-fi freak jams!  We needed this!  The scientology and the depression fall to the back seat, makin' out with a dodo bird like that!  Check!  the videos are the most amazing spectacle since the Mellow Gold videos.   <br /> <br />Some fools come incorrect insisting that Beck sounds like Beck and that this is bad.  But Beck has always sounded like Beck, in case you haven't noticed.  Should he make a BB King record?  no.  And he already did that Kenny G thing.  That's done, like 6 years ago. <br /> <br />Sea Change was amazing, but it didn't fill the Beck related needs in those special ways.  Guero couldn't hold the hype of the 8-bit remixes... this comes as the real deal.  Better times are coming our way! <br /> <br />And it'd plenty fun to make your collage artwork!

B000ICL3KG|5.0|Whether or not you like Al Gore, this movie is more informative than it is political, more scientific than it is controversial, and more intelligent than anything Michael Moore could cook up. Nothing against Moore, but Al Gore looks at solutions rather than place the blame on one man or small group. Gore explains the basic facts of how global warming works and has gathered some fascinating pictures and slides of the earth; the filming of this picture was at times breathtaking. He also describes his early years on his father's tobacco farm, and how his sister died from lung cancer. Although he has gone through years of heartbreak and defeat, this film is a huge victory, as Gore seems refreshed and positive, and whether or not you like his politics, he is in fact a brilliant man, deeply committed to getting his message out and making the United States a great place to live. And this is a brilliant documentary that delves deep into the prospect of global warming and the threat that we all face. Moreover, it is our responsibility to clean up our messes and leave something behind for future generations. Even Bill O'Reilly has recently stated that global warming is a threat that \\"is real and should be taken seriously.\\" And I respect his opinion. And I now have new respect for Al Gore. I am also glad that Gore waited until after the midterm elections to release this on DVD, because it was not in many theatres and this type of movie could influence an election particularly in the wake of hurricaine Katrina. Each year that goes by, new evidence comes forward that makes Gore seem more like a genius than a radical advocate for this stuff. What evidence has ever been produced that can prove Gore is wrong? You would be wise to invest in this film, and do so with an open mind and ear.
B0007GAERG|3.0|... I have admired Mariah Carey and her powerful voice since she first came on the scene as a skinny unknown whose talent left no doubt that the rumors of one parent being an opera singer must be true.  The title of this album might be straight from her heart, however I suspect that with her background she probably enjoys the romantic spin and new ending it gives to the story of Mimi in the opera \\"La Boheme.\\"   <br /> <br />I still think Carey is a very talented and incredibly beautiful young woman, but I really don't like this album.  For the most part her incredible voice, charm and humor are drowned in annoying distractions, reminding one of trying to listen to a good CD in one's car while some idiot is blasting their generic dance-club noise nearby.  Most of the male guest voices are unpleasant, to say the least.  Carey's young, though, and entitled to have some fun.  I give the album three stars because here and there it is pleasant.  But much of it can be so obnoxious that I'll have to program my stereo to recognize and skip some of the titles.  I liken Carey to Sinead O'Connor, another staggeringly talented young singer.  They are both entitled to follow their dreams, and in both cases, I hope that there will be future albums which showcase their talents in more admirable and enduring ways.
1400032717|4.0|I love a book that forces a new perspective.  All too often we get into a rut with our books as far as the narrator is concerned.  Reading this book gives you a great insight into someone else's perspective, reasoning, and thought processes.  Certainly, many books are capable of evoking a sense of empathy for some random criminal or detective or whoever the story is being told by.  This one though gives you a good insight into the reasoning of those that too many of us just assume have little or no capacity for reason whatsoever . . . those that just babble and ramble on incessantly.  It's a quick, easy, and entertaining read.
B0000028P8|4.0|This album is short like a photo of a galaxy is short... it doesn't take up a lot of space but it encompasses vastness almost beyond measure.  This is the Mariah Carey who more than deserves her fame, a musician with a powerful and beautiful voice and sense of timing.  Don't let the short list of titles put you off, this is a Mariah Carey album that should be in your collection, close at hand, if you like her at all.
B000EQH2QK|1.0|This CD is not dance music, which is all my narrow mind is interested in. It may be great for listening or whatever, but its not dance and it should not be listed under dance pop. <br />john
B000HIVO64|5.0|Back when I was insane about Beck he was a folk-rap-punk-garage rocker, who in my ears did just about everything right up until about 1998. I think his last great album came out in X-mas of that year. It was Mutations, and little did we know, Beck was going en-route to being a staight up funkateer, electro music, space cadet.. (ok, maybe we knew a little... but he also went en-route to some sort of easy-elevator-dentist office sound that was a little too odd for me.)<br /><br />Well, he's come back to us, full circle. This time around on THE INFORMATION he has ensembled a band, that plays a few good old fashioned instruments, like the half fked up electric guitar, the half broken acoustic guitar, some cups and dishes, and a gameboy rigged to become a musical instrument.<br /><br />Now I have enjoyed Beck through pretty much every phase of his career, but I have gotsta say that I have missed his more gutsy tunes for some time. Theres a good chunk of raw, mind bending tunes in this package. There is still a few of the more sugary style tunes too, but all together they work pretty well. The top three for me are NASEAU (this song would have been much better though had it been expanded by a few more minutes of the crazy rhythm break down- instead it just ends out of nowhere) then theres CELLPHONES DEAD- funky... and 1000BPM, great garage sound on that one. The disc also contains alot od=f sixties pop rock numbers, that work well in some spots, and not so well in others.<br /><br />BUT- the kicker here, and the reason I award five stars, is the incredibly trippy, and visually brilliant DVD. We get a whole collage of colors, costumes, beautiful women (in costumes), and spacey images to blow the mind. I could watch that thing over and over-its wicked. Beck still is brilliant, and plenty of people seem to be on par with his material these days. I love the raw sounds that he made his name on back in the day-day, and I'm glad to say that theres plenty of rock and roll madness in this madness.<br /><br />Plus theres stickers.madness.  <br />Plus theres stickers.
B0002MB7QW|3.0|Okay movie but kind of repetitive.  Plenty of action but lacks in the story. The actors other than Quaid and gyllenhaal were weak. This movie iS the absulute WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I HATE DENNIS, HE REMINDS ME OF MY UNCLE! just joking. The movie's action scenes were good but it seems like there are the same actions seens three times in the movie! But other than that It's pretty good!
B000IOM1RI|2.0|Tenacious D's first album was a masterpiece.  It was hilarious and the music was great.  I think all of Jack Black's talent was sucked out of him in that horrible movie, School of Rock.  He's simply not funny anymore.  More than half of the songs on this album are just trash... Jack Black saying \\"bibbily-bee\\" 100 times is funny every once in a while... but it's half of this album.  Cursing every other word isn't really my definition of funny either.  Their first album had ridiculous over-the-top lyrics.  They swore, but it it added to the goofiness... This album just sounds like they're swearing to swear.  I'm not nine years old.  The only really good songs are History (which is older than their first album) and the POD (which has to be radio friendly).  The Gov't Totally Sucks is almost a good song as well, but it falls short.<br /><br />Without going into it very much... The music isn't very good on this album either.  Any song from their first album can show up when I hit random and fits well into my normal rock catalog, but I imagine I'd skip half of these songs if they show up because they're mostly boring.  They're not bad by any means, but just not very interesting.<br /><br />Let's not forget Kyle... He's hardly on this album.<br /><br />I don't know if making this album as a soundtrack limited them in what they could do... I hope so.  Otherwise, they've just lost whatever they had.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Although different from earlier releases, make no mistake this brilliant and ambitious album retains the MCR trademark.  Earlier MCR albums (which I also like very much), have had a greater sense of urgency and spontaneity - The Black Parade is measured, deliberate and focused.  <br /> <br />The Black Parade is a Concept (thematic) album based on the voyage through the death process of \\"the patient\\".  Unlike \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" their second album (also a concept album), the metaphor and fiction have not been plied as thickly - the audience is lead on a journey that is in essence a thinly veiled reflective analysis of Gerard Way's (lead vocals and lyricist), own life.  Growing up as a somewhat overweight introverted nerdy kid, who was ostracised by the mainstream, Gerard initially pursued a career as a comic book illustrator, but quickly became disillusioned after working in the industry.  Having witnessed events of 9/11 on his way to work, he decided to do something more meaningful with his life....that something became music.  After forming the band, MCR very quickly exploded into popularity and Gerard found himself catapulted to rock icon status - initially his coping mechanism for rite of passage being pills and alcohol, which almost pulled the band apart.  Now well free of the chemical props, Gerard has embraced his position as \\"rock star\\" and driving force of a band that will surely find a position in rock history. This album is very much about putting the uglier moments of his life under the microscope. <br /> <br />Musically, the band has matured and gained a greater sense of artistic confidence - allowing them to take risks to explore different musical styles.  Yes of course they have incorporated sounds and styles from other artists and genres (and how many other artists haven't), but they do it in such a way as to retain MCR integrity.  We are exposed to a lot more of Gerard's vocal capability (somewhat buried in the more chaotic layers of guitars, yelling and screaming of earlier albums), the guitar work is much more skilful and \\"positioned\\", and a broader range of instruments have been introduced to the suite of sounds - all adding to richer, more multidimensional pieces of work.  Each song is a stand alone gem, different from the next - varying in tempo and style to suit the message. The lyrics are simpler, direct and more visually powerful than those of previous albums. <br /> <br />This album is evidence of a band that has a greater sense of clarity about their music and what they want to say through it.  Sadly, it's likely that this album will see the loss of MCR's hardcore emo/punk fans, but the gain is a broader audience who can appreciate the music for what it is rather than something from a genre the band supposedly represents. <br /> <br />I have added The Black Parade to my all time favourite classic album list, but for those who are uncertain, at least listen to it all the way through - it is most deserving of your attention. <br /> <br />
B0000028W9|5.0|Most of this great album is featured on \\"The Essential Leonard Cohen\\", which I've owned for a few years.  Still, I bought \\"The Future\\" to enjoy the great songs I knew in their original order and context and to hear the few tracks that aren't on the later compilation.  In whatever order, songs like \\"The Future\\", \\"Democracy\\", \\"Waiting for the Miracle\\", \\"Anthem\\" and \\"Closing Time\\" are all Cohen classics--each with its unique element of anger, irony, longing, reverence or joy.  It's a dream of mine for someday, someone to sing \\"Anthem\\" at my church, perhaps even me.  Of the \\"non-essential\\" songs, \\"Light as a Breeze\\" was the best--perhaps Cohen's most erotic song ever, though I haven't heard everything.  \\"Be For Real\\" was a very loving cover--right down to the closing \\"Thanks for the song, Mr. Knight\\".  Being a fan of lyrics, \\"Tacoma Trailer\\" didn't do as much for me.  I'll excuse \\"Always\\" as a paean to Irving Berlin and a chance to loosen up in front of the mike. It doesn't sound like this one was done in very many takes.  I haven't listened to all of Cohen's albums to be able to say that \\"The Future\\" is the best, but with its concentration of great songs, it's got to be right up there.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|THis is a great album, its very long (great for driving), with 14 songs,  some stand out way more than others, thats the nature of buying an album.  If you want to buy cds that only have the chart hits on it, buy the singles...  And comparing it to Bat out of Hell I and II, each album is meant to be different, and each album was recorded at different stages in Meatloaf career....  If you want Bat out of Hell I, buy Bat out of Hell I.  Anyway  approach this album for a new sonic experiance and you will be pleasantly suprised.
6302020301|4.0|More than 20 years old now and a little dated, Spinal Tap is still loads of fun with the \\"mockumentary\\" gang including Christopher Guest and Michael McKean (who did the delightful \\"Best in Show\\" in 2000).  Every aspect of `60s and `70s rock music is lampooned.  Surprisingly, director/interviewer Rob Reiner comes off a little flat--but maybe that's just to help highlight the rest of the delightfully dim cast of characters.  \\"Big Bottom\\" (a sendup of \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\"--one of my politically incorrect favorites), the \\"sophisticated\\" \\"Sex Farm\\", and the controversial \\"Smell the Glove\\" (ultimately released as Tap's \\"Black Album\\") are among \\"Tap's\\" big hits.
B000H305U0|5.0|\\"Those flashing lights come from everywhere (echo)  <br />The way they hit her I had to stop & stare...\\"  <br />These are the lyrics for the ending of \\"Lovestoned/I think she knows\\", which is just one of the many good songs on Justin Timberlake's well crafted new album \\"FutureSex/LoveSounds\\". Here is my review of Justin's excellent album track by track:  <br /> <br />1)FutureSex/Lovesound-This song is a great way to start the album, it  has a great futurisitic sound to it & it really works. I particularly like the chorus. 5/5 <br /> <br />2)Sexyback-Ok, eventhough I am a huge Justin fan, I absolutely HATED this song when I first heard it. I thought it was stupid, had no chourus & I thought Justin sounded feminine...I also thought to myself \\"What the hell is bringing sexyback, when did it leave in the first place\\"?-HOWEVER, after a few more listens I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SONG NOW! It's so catchy and different from whatever is on radio right now...& suprisingly this song really works when it is performed live. Not to mention the fact that along with coming up with the phrase \\"Waldrobe Malfunction\\" Justin has also come up with the unlikely catchphrase \\"I'm bringing sexyback\\"-This guy is genius! 5/5 <br /> <br />3)SexyLadies/Let Me Talk You-This song reminds me a bit of prince, it has a funky beat & is catchy, but it is repetative & overall it's one of the few weak tracks on the album. I actually fell asleep while listening to this song, lol sorry JT-I still love u though babes! 4/5 <br /> <br />4)My Love-Ok, this song is just burning up the charts-I am hearing this song all over the place, on the radio, in the hood (which is suprising) everywhere!-THIS SONG IS MONSTER! Timbaland did a great job with the production, the beat on this song is amazing. TI is also a great addition to the song, his rap adds a nice flavor to it. I can't say enough good things about this \\"My Love\\"-everyone (for the most part) seems to be loving this song-the beat is just infectious, Great choice for a second single!-6/5 <br /> <br />5)Lovestoned/I think she knows-This song is funky,danceable(that a word? lol), it's just an overall great song, but when you think the song comes to an end that's when things get interesting, this is like a two in one song combo. The ending of the \\"Lovestoned\\" segways into \\"I think she knows\\" which reminds me of a Coldplay track, the beat is AMAZING & I love the lyrics. This song is genius....6/5 <br /> <br />6)What Goes Around/Comes Around Interlude-Like Lovestoned, this song is another two in one song combo. Some feel this song is about Britney, Justin denies this, but it has Britney written all over it. The lyrics on this \\"What goes around/comes around\\" are particularyly good & the \\"Comes Around\\" interlude is again genius (yes i love this word haha)! Everyone NEEDS to listen to this song,especially the ending because it really is incredible. I hope Justin releases this as a single. 6/5 <br /> <br />7)Chop Me Up-This song is more hip hop than anything else on JT's album. Three Six Mafia, Justin & Timbaland have great chemistry & this song suprisingly works, a definite club banger! 5/5 <br /> <br />8)Damn Girl-It took me a while to like this song, but now I really like it. It has Prince written all over it and Will.I.Am from the BEP did a good job on production. I also like the lyrics, i.e. when Justin says \\"I guess I gotta put it dowwwwwn tonite\\", Cameron u lucky girl! lol. 5/5 <br /> <br />9)Summer Love/Set The Mood prelude-I really like this song. The beat is very good & catchy too bad JT didn't release it during the summer (no pun intended) because I think it would have been a big hit. I could listen to this song over and over. Nice! 5/5 <br /> <br />10)Until The End of Time-Sexy! That's all I really need to say, but this song reminds me of something an R&B group such as Jodeci or Silk would have sung back in the day, it has a nice old school feel to it. I'm lovin this song. 5/5 <br /> <br />11)Losing My Way-This song finds Justin venturing into different territory with lyrics that reference being a drug addicted man who has lost his family & friends. I read some reviews that criticized Justin for these lyrics but if he continued to only sing about Love,sex,girls & sex some more, people would still complain. So he can't win either way, but it's nice to see Justin take a risk and sing about something other than  lost love & women. This song really works. It is very inspirational & the Choir was a very nice addition to the song, their voices are amazing! 6/5 <br /> <br />12)(Another Song) All Over Again-I particularly like this song because it SHUTS DOWN what JT haters have to say as far as Justin not being able to sing. Justin shows what a great voice he has on this song with just him playin the piano (yes he does play instruments)...I suppose some think Justin can't sing because he uses his falsetto for most songs, but on this track Justin shows what he is capable of. This is his best vocal performance since \\"Gone\\"-I love the simplicity of this song. Great way to end the album! 6/5 <br /> <br />Overall this is one of the best album's released this year. With the exception of one song (Sexyladies) This whole album works. Timbaland did a great job on the production and Justin has to be given credit also b/c i've noticed some act as though the producers just do all the work and Justin does nothing, but he wrote/co-wrote all the songs on the album and play's the piano and the guitar & he is just a very talented guy. Justin is the only one out of all the boybands to succeed solo, so obviously he know's what he's doing. I look forward to hearing more great albums from Justin in the future.  <br /> <br />My top 5: <br /> <br />-FutureSex/Lovesound <br />-My Love <br />-What goes around/Comes Around <br />-Lovestoned/I think she knows <br />-Another Song (All over Again)
080017948X|3.0|Sometimes timeshifting works (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and sometimes it doesn't, as in Groundhog Day, a moderately entertaining romantic comedy starring Bill Murray and Andie McDowell.  Murray does his usual fine and seemingly effortless job of playing the jaded TV weatherman Phil Connors on \\"one-day\\" journey of discovery of the meaning of life.  After awhile I understood the what and why, but I just couldn't get past how he kept waking up in the same day, other than to satisfy the needs of the script.  I guess at some level the story was a fairy tale, like Beauty and the Beast, with the hourglass holding in place until the beast figured out what to do. Maybe Charlie Kaufman could have written this so that cynics like me would get it.  A reluctant 3 stars, but 2 1/2 is more like it.<br /><br />More notes (1/28/07): Of all people, my minister helped me understand this film better.  Quoting from a book called \\"The Zen Commandments\\", he mentioned the value of kindness in getting us out of a rut.  The author also noted the film started Groundhog Day exactly 42 times, the traditional \\"six more weeks\\" of winter.  With that insight I'll increase by rating to the full three stars.  I still liked \\"Eternal Sunshine\\" better.
B000I5X80G|5.0|I thought I'd inform all of you guys as to why there's only 6 songs on this release as opposed to the full show. Here's an explination I found on Wikipedia: <br /> <br />\\"Some fans have expressed disappointment that this, the first release from the Archives project, contains only six tracks. On the tour, the Crazy Horse set was preceded each night by a five song solo acoustic set. As the release is barely over 40 minutes long, there would have been room left over on the CD for \\"On the Way Home,\\" \\"Broken Arrow,\\" \\"I am a Child\\" or other songs performed during the tour. During a trailer for the release found on Young's official website (see external links below), it is explained that from the two shows featured on the release, multi-track recordings of only five songs survive. Thus, it may be that the acoustic set and \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" are not included due to sound quality problems, not subjective reasons.\\" <br /> <br />So the irony of this situation is that why a lot of you complain about the quality of the release, the reason Neil did not release the whole show is because he felt the quality was not up to par with the multi-track recordings. <br /> <br />
6305949980|5.0|Not quite a \\"one-of-a-kind\\" movie any more (James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride used the same stop-action technology), but still in a class by itself, \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is both my favorite Christmas movie, and my favorite movie from among my daughter's collection (though \\"Toy Story\\" is right there to this child of the early '60s).  The brilliant character of Jack Skellington, \\"The Pumpkin King\\", and Danny Elfman's amazing score and songs carry the show, but there are plenty of other high(low?)lights among the dozens of ghoulish characters and scenes--the two-faced mayor, the Strangelovian mad scientist, the minor-key string quartet...too many to list.  Catherine O'Hara's poignant voicing of the Jack's cautious admirer, Sally, adds a heartfelt touch to what overall is a pretty strange tale--the hijacking of Christmas and kidnapping of Santa Claus by the denizens of Halloween.  My daughter loved this movie too (though she was just born when it came out), but I think I loved it best then and now.  \\"Look, Zero--they're thanking us!\\" Five enthusiastic stars!
B000J103X4|5.0|This album is dope, no dre, no 50, no g-unit. its better then the documentary, i mean snoop, rakim, ice cube, hitman, the list goes on about how many people dre left a-lone, the only dif is the fact that game came back and did it faster, quicker, and better than they did. PEOPLE HATE ON HOW he drops dre's name, same people who forget snoop did it plenty of times on The Doggytsyle album, and now that The Game is on top of the charts, he is the only one from cali who did it(Snoop Dogg,2Pac)without a Dr.Dre beat. Pac was on top of the rap game, Biggie was on top of the rap game, and both lived by the lyrics, so if this album is lyriclly better then the first 1, its better then the 1st one period. The Fact that dre's not in, and 50 talks down is the main reason game worked harder. if 50 the reason why Game went Plat, 1st time around then 50's the same reason why G-unit is flopin? + Game is going Platinum 4Shure. people mad cuz he got the number 1 spot, same people who never wanted 2 c the doctors advocate drop. And everybody know game, 5 shots, no pain -str8 from Scream On Em. this is more emotional, harder, more ruged, and west coast then his other album. Scream On Em aka Put You On The Game part2, Too Much iz bananas, One Night is somethin speacial, Wouldnt get Far was funny, espeacially when he says, i got the scoop on hoopz whatever the case, she let u spray in her face, ha ha ha, game on the rebound and he's pullin the boards like rodman in a pistons jerz, Why Hate the game, cuz he just did somethin everybody thought wasnt possible from his calaber, everysong is good, u should buy it, if u already have it listen 2 it over and over till u feel the same. the best line from 1 of the best song's is \\"i spit 4 my ni**az in the line up that il never c the sun again, so i close my blinds up\\" Game Over i think not, if anything The Game's Just Started.
B00009Z576|5.0|I've only recently discovered this incredible album by Yes entitled \\"Drama\\"!  I was a big Prog rock fan, as well as a Yes fan back in the seventies, but quit listening as most the prog bands were slowly fading away into the past.  The last Yes album that I had listened to was Relayer, my favorite until now.  I could not, and still cannot stomach \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans!\\" People that do not like the album \\"Drama\\" probably just don't get it!  It's an absolutely fantastic recording, and it's all YES!  I had never realized that Jon Anderson wasn't even in the band on this one, nor did many of my Yes fanatic friends who failed to read the liner notes!  Trevor Horn is lead vocalist on this one and sounds amazingly like Anderson.  Trevor's singing carries with it more emotion than Anderson ever did.  The opening track \\"Machine Messiah\\" is a purely YES song drenched in tongue-in-cheek humor that most people don't understand.  It starts out with this overdriven guitar line that sounds nothing like YES, almost trying to fool all of us into thinking that they've finally lost it!  It repeats quite a few times. It is \\"Dramatic\\" sounding in a cheap sort of way.  Then it suddenly stops and is replaced by acoustic guitar and the lush close vocal harmonies we have come to expect from this group! It is all very reminiscent of earlier Yes days, as if to say \\" Aha! There! We've fooled you! We are still here, we are still YES!\\"  Machine Messiah is a masterful work!  Keyboard player Geoffrey Downes is the greatest Yes keyboard man since Patrick Moraz.  I especially love his addition of Charles Marie Widor's organ Toccata during the opening track!  Most organists will agree that it's one of the most dramatic pieces of organ music ever written!  This is another little joke that nobody seems to notice.<br /><br />Another one of my favorite tracks is a song written by Trevor Horn called \\"Into The Lens\\", which most people might remember as \\"I Am A Camera.\\"  It actually became somewhat of a hit bridging pop with prog!  It's a beautifully crafted song that keeps on building till the end.  So, don't be afraid to buy this disc!  Don't feel that you are betraying Jon Anderson by listening to it.  I'm sure you can confess your sins to him later!what of a hit bridging pop with prog!  It's a beautifully crafted song that keeps on building till the end.   So, don't be afraid to buy this disc!  Don't feel that you are betraying Jon Anderson by listening to it.  I'm sure you can confess your sins to him later!
B000IU3XTM|3.0|First things first, this is not O. I read a statement by Damien saying alot of this album was similar to O, and I honestly don't agree. It's deeper, darker, and more damaging. The guy obviously has deep issues that he belts out on tracks like Elephant and the heavily underrated Rootless Tree, which may actually be my favorite Damien Rice song. My favorites on the record are 9 Crimes, Elephant, Rootless Tree, Grey Room, Dogs and I also like his B-Side The Rat Against the Grain, off the 9 Crimes single. It's definitely worth the listen. The album doesn't feel as complete as O, but it's still great music to listen to any day of the week. Thumbs up for Mr. Rice!
B000FQ4M58|1.0|i must be in my own world.i just saw borat-great reviews,huge audience.my do i bring that up.i thought the movie stunk,was disgusting and had very few laughs.am i missing something but how does almost everyone love or like this album.i am a big meatloaf fan.to me bat 1 and 2 were equally great.bat two had great fast songs like everything louder,out of frying pan,rock and roll dreams, id like to you,life is a lemon  and had some great ballads.chsib and welcome to the neighborhood were very good.previous meatloaf albums had great ,catchy piano lines.this album lacks the great piano in previous meatloaf albums and most importantly lacks any great tunes and melodies including these jim steinman songs.this is a huge disappointment.but i am getting used to it.u2 last album vertgio had very few good songs and springsteens devils and dust was horrible.are their any meatloaf fans out there that agree with me.and i thought his melbourne dvd was fantastic.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|It was one year ago today when this CD was released as many musicgoers were wondering if Madonna could bounce back from her ill-faded slump in record sales. Well, Madonna has proved she can easily find her way back to the dance floor with ease and confidence. She may borrow a few disco grooves here and there with samples of Abba in the lead song, while the opening to \\"Future Lovers\\" has an uncanny similarity to Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love,\\" but Madonna still makes this album all her own with every kind of dance hook and robotic rhythm that can be created as the songs segue from one to the next without interruption. The best tracks include \\"Get Together,\\" \\"Sorry,\\" \\"Future Lovers,\\" \\"Let it Will Be,\\" \\"How High,\\" and \\"Jump,\\" which unfortunately got ignored by radio. The only flack I'd give this release is the closing song, \\"Like it or Not,\\" because Madonna should stop trying to convince the world that she remains a staple of controversy. After listening to the song, you might feel an eagerness to tell her \\"We've moved on,\\" but don't let that stop you from purchasing this CD. Confessions on a Dance Floor is her best release since 1998's Ray of Light.
B000003TB6|3.0|As a musician, DJ and a hip hop afficianado, I enjoy listening to these guys. Tariq is a top-shelf, A-class lyricist, while Amhir is wondrous on the percussion. My complaint with this album is the same as my complaint with the first one, Organix. It just doesn't grab me like the rest of the catalog does. To me it seems as though they are still finding themselves creatively. There some excellent tracks here (e.g. Distortion to Static, Silent Treatment) but the coherence isn't quite there. That said, this is STILL a necessary part of the collection, as it offers itself as a prelude to their excellence in the years to come.
B00005V0X5|3.0|this is a good metal album,not as good as other megadeth records but you can definitely see the potential there,i would recommend this to any metal fan
B000H305U0|4.0|Justin has beaten the sophmore jinx and does not disappoint his second time out. With the help of Timbaland, he has delivered one of the best albums of the year, hands down. As a fan of Timbaland, I must say that he has totally changed his swagger and started producing pop masterpieces. The sound these two have created here will serve to cement JT as a pop mainstay. My only complaint is it's length for I thought the album was too short. Other than that, this one is a must have.
B000063DGC|4.0|this collection of live material is great.the only complaint is that sometimes it sounds like the vocals are not loud enough.this shows why randy rhoads was so great. a must buy
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|For those of you that don't know, J-Dilla (A.K.A. JayDee) is one of the best producers in music today. Unfortunately he is also one of the least known and therefore one of the most underrated. Those in the know understand what I mean. He has produced hits for some of the best in music. I mean his production of \\"Got 'Til It's Gone\\" by Janet Jackson (one of her BEST songs in recent years I might add) alone should get him a place in someone's hall of fame somewhere. Not only was he able to employ the use of a sampler like no one else, but he was also a genius at creating his own music. I mean some of the game's best like Pete Rock and Pharrell realize HE was a master at what he did. Just take a listen to \\"Stop\\" (track 6). Now find the original Dionne Warwick song he sampled and observe how intricate he was. He 'chopped' up his stuff like no other, which really is where the beauty and creativity lie in sampling. This album bascially perfect and is most certainly a must have for anyone that appreciates the art of beat mining and production. Dilla had an unbelievable knack for chopping up samples that few others share (those others include Pete Rock and DJ Premier). It is a shame he had to go so early, though the good one's always do. Rest In Peace brother .......... and thanks for your gift of Donuts!
B000063DFS|3.0|this album has some great songs on it,it should be a 3.5,the reason i cant rate it any higher is that some of the tracks are downright cheesy such as the opening mr.tinkertrain,aside from that there are alot of great tunes on here such as mama,the road to nowhere,time after time etc zakks playing is great,somewhat sounding like a gary rossington here,definitely amust have.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|That's all I really have to say. Anyone who liked Mastodon before may like them even better now. They've actually improved on their sound with this record. Pretty much the same style as Leviathan with better songwriting, production, and riffs.  No worries about a major label letdown here.  Easily the best metal record of the year so far.  I like the new Slayer and Lamb of God but Mastodon is a step ahead.  \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\" in particular is just an awesome song with a killer intro riff and awesome verse.

B000J103X4|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS MOST DEF ANOTHER WEST COAST CLASSIC. IT'S DOESN'Y TOP THE DOCUMENTARY BUT ITS STILL PRETTY DAMN GOOD. I LIKE THAT HE KEEPS IT WEST COAST AND HE DOES NOT NAME DROP NEARLY AS MUCH AS HE DOES ON THE MIXTAPES. I ALSO GOTTA RESPECT HIM FOR BEING HIS OWN MAN WITHOUT DRE TRACKS. YES EXPECTATIONS ARE HIGH, BUT GAME IS DESTINED TO BE UP THERE WITH PAC, SNOOP AND DRE. <br /> <br />P.S THE BEATZ ARE SICK AND HE DOES NOT NEED DRE BEATZ TO HAVE HITS!
0938045695|3.0|Although this is a much better effort than his previous kettlebell book, I find \\"Enter the Kettlebell\\" lacking in too many areas to be taken seriously.  It is incredibly overpriced at $35 and for the money it is not complete in and of itself but will require the reader, besides having to purchase a set of very expensive different size/weight kettlebells, to either (a) spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to take a \\"certified\\" kettlebell course or (b) purchase an expensive DVD that may or may not help in learning how to properly perform the movements - and make no mistake about it - one false move while swinging a 35-70 pound ball of iron could be quite hazardous to your health. <br /> <br />I was confused by the many typographical errors with whole paragraphs being repeated out of sequence in non-related chapters and the lack of, (and in at least once instance out of sequence)photographs, required to do an adequate job of conveying how to properly execute the various movements.   <br /> <br />In the book Pavel describes the various kettlebell movements and does well in attempting to convince the beginner to master the initial movements before taking on the more rigorous routines.  All this is geared towards preparing the reader to be able to pass the Russian Kettlebell \\"Rite of Passage\\" - a wacky cult-type idiom for being able to complete a certain number of repetitions in the snatch and the clean and press.  To what end, I really have no idea, except to be able to go to the Pavel website and brag to others about your achievement, as probably no one else is going to be much impressed by your ability to do boring, endless and mindless repetitions of the same movement. <br /> <br />Pavel does a great job of promoting his own products and there is an entire section describing the \\"rocket science\\", \\"painstaking\\" production techniques utilized in making the \\"perfectly balanced\\" kettlebell - i.e., a lump of iron with a handle.  By the way, these balls of iron, while not only impractical in most environments and settings, are not cheap - costing anywhere from $2.50-3.00 or more per pound by the time they are shipped from the \\"secret Russian master craftsman ironworks\\" in Minnesota!  Compare that to around 45-55 cents per pound for Olympic or exercise weight plates. <br /> <br />Surely this must be a Russian plot to bilk hard-working Americans out of their money and send them on a mission of useless training programs?  Lets face it, Pavel has been able to jump on the \\"fitness bandwagon\\" full of trendy and useless training ideas and equipment so popular in America - and I am sure his is laughing all the way to the bank. <br /> <br />\\"Take down that wall Gorby\\"...so those wacky Russians can live the American dream by selling over-hyped books supposedly containing valuable Russian training \\"secrets\\". <br /> <br />The outrageous claims made for the benefits of using kettlebells, usually by \\"certified\\" Russian kettle bell instructors seeking to profit from their use, only serve to add to the hype, i.e. \\"My 90 year old blind grandmother started swinging a 9kg kettlebell in her wheelchair and a few weeks later she could see and was running 100-yard dashes!\\"  The truth is, take a sedentary, overweight individual and put them on almost any exercise regimen and yes, their fitness will most likely improve and they will probably lose weight! Amazing! <br /> <br />As much as the kettlebell \\"cultists\\" would like you to believe how great they are, fortunately most of us are not confined to a Russian gulag or currently in exile in Siberia working out with balls of iron with a handle in the sub-freezing cold, performaing boring, mind numbing endless repetitions of snatches and swings.  No, somewhere a long time ago, someone came up with the idea of ADJUSTABLE dumbells and barbells with which you can progressively add weight and perform a wide variety of challenging and interesting exercises and thereby grow in functional strength and muscularity.   <br /> <br />Thousands upon thousands of trainees around the world have built great physiques, strength and fitness without ever having touched a kettlebell.  Keep that in mind and try to see past the hype.  Invest in a set of barbells/dumbells (you can purchase a nice set for the price of one kettlebell, kettlebell books, kettlebell DVD's and everything else you are going to need to become proficient in their use) - seek out a qualified trainer or get a good, no nonsense weight training book, work hard, smart and consistently - add some interval type cardio work and you can get incredibly fit and develop strength and achieve your goals - there are really no \\"secrets\\", Russian or otherwise.

He has some great insights on how to value stocks not only based on P/E ratios but also through other insightful metrics like the return of invested capital.  Definitely a good read.  I also purchased Investing  Without  Losing (ISBN: 0978834607 NOT on amazn, on other stores) which is an alternative to the usual stock, bonds, and mutual funds investing.
B000003S09|5.0|I am out of my mind to find this album!  I'm always quoting from it, and no one knows it.  Hello being 16 again!  Play it loud!
B0000028M7|5.0|This album should not be categorized as anything other than classic. it goes above and beyond genre. THIS is art. Dirt is by far the best album i have ever heard. there's pain, regret, anger, hate, and something not really seen in music today: PASSION! Layne Staley uses his songwriting to give you a peek into his soul. you get to feel his pain rather than just hear it. he has the greatest and most emotional voice in music that really makes the band what it is. jerry cantrell's guitar playing is simply flawless and the whole band just plays in sync making this a masterpiece. this is for sure AIC's best album and, in my opinion, the best album of the 90's. after listening to this you'll definitely want to own the rest of their releases. if you don't become utterly obsessed with this band's music after really listening to it, there must be something wrong with you! a 5 star masterpiece that should be in everyone's collection.     RIP Layne. we love you and you'll live forever in our hearts    P.S.: pick up \\"Above\\" by Mad Season too. you wont be sorry!

B0000E64TR|5.0|This album is more than one of Elton's best recordings; it is also one of the best rock albums of all time. The production is excellent, the music is played nearly flawlessly, the lyrics are some of the best Taupin ever wrote, and the music is some of the best Elton has written.<br /><br />This album starts off with a beautiful instrumental, \\"Funeral for a Friend,\\" which segues into \\"Love Lies Bleeding.\\" \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" should be experienced rather than described.<br /><br />Everyone knows \\"Candle in the Wind.\\" This version is the original, and is a moving tribute to Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />\\"Bennie and the Jets;\\" the song is pretty good, but didn't come off quite as well as Elton wanted it to. The crowd participated less than Elton had intended. Regardless, the lyrics and music are wonderful, and a bit of insider commentary on pop musicians and their fans.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is a 70s pop/rock anthem. Every greatest hits of the 70's list includes this song. Played heavily on top 40 radio for several years and now frequently on classic rock stations, this song was an instant classic.<br /><br />The next two songs are underappreciated. \\"This Song Has No Title\\" and \\"Grey Seal\\" are both very good songs. There is a serious undertone to \\"Grey Seal\\" that hints at perceptions and feelings, and perhaps the difficulty of being an individual in modern society. \\"Grey Seal\\" was re-done for \\"Yellow Brick Road,\\" having been previously recorded in a style more like that of \\"Empty Sky.\\" The original version can be found on the \\"Rare Masters\\" CD. I prefer this version, which is more polished.<br /><br />\\"Jamaica Jerk-off\\" is a silly song. However, someone did their homework because while the song is a bit annoying at times, it fits well where it was positioned on the CD.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\" is a bluesy song that is mellow and moving, and relates life to - what else - the movies. If you like soft rock with a touch of heavy, this is a good song. \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" laments the life of prostitutes, and is sad rather than condescending. \\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey\\" should be part of a soundtrack to a movie; it feels like it came from a soundtrack. The song contains a fictional story that draws imagery from the fictionalized accounts of characters such as Bonnie and Clyde. This song just as easily could have been the ballad of Clyde Barrow. This well-executed song provides enjoyable listening.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Little Girl\\" is lyrically a bit of a puzzler for me. I was unable to definitely divine Taupin's point. On the surface the lyrics appear to be about someone physically dirty needing a bath with the reference to a social worker, likely someone who is poor. But is there a point to the lyrics? Regardless, this song is one of the rocking songs on this CD, along with two others that appear right after \\"All the Girls Love Alice,\\" which is a sorrowful song about a young female lesbian.<br /><br />Two back-to-back rockers follow that are the fastest songs on the CD: \\"Your Sister Can't Dance\\" and \\"Saturday Night's alright for Fighting.\\" These are songs to play at that party you were planning, along with \\"Dirty Little Girl.\\" Elton John can rock when he chooses.<br /><br />The last three songs cluster nicely since all three deal with different topics. The first song, \\"Roy Rogers,\\" I really enjoy though it gives me a strong feeling of nostalgia every time I listen to it. Not really a tribute to Roy Rogers so much as a tribute to old movies and TV shows, the feeling they give you, and memories of days gone by.<br /><br />\\"Social Disease\\" is a mixture of thoughts, but the theme seems to be borderline alcohol abuse. I say borderline because the principal character seems to like his life. Perhaps that is an understatement. The principal character seems to revel in his life.<br /><br />The last song on this CD is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, \\"Harmony.\\" As happens so often with some songs, this song is flawedin that it could have been twice as long and even then it might not have been long enough. This song is very beautiful, though there seems to be two themes intertwined that may be aspects of the same theme. One theme is that of love by someone who is on the verge of obsession. The other is a musical question; will I continue to be able to sing well in the future, and for how long? Listening to the song I was unable to pick up on the second theme, but reading the lyrics I realized that the song could be interpreted in the second way.<br /><br />This version of \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\\" which is in sumptuous hybrid SACD, contains bonus songs.  \\"Jack Rabbit\\" is the first, \\"Screw You (Young Man's Blues\\" is the second, \\"Whenever You're Ready (We'll Go Steady Again)\\" is the third, and a version of \\"Candle in the Wind\\" is the fourth.  The first three songs are also available as bonus songs on some versions of \\"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only the Piano Player\\" and in the \\"Rare Masters\\" boxed set.  These songs are okay and nice to have just to fill out CD space.<br /><br />If you like Elton's music, then you must be reading this review for curiosity, because you already have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". If you like pop/rock from the 70s, then you already have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\" If you have heard music from the 70s and want to find the better music from that era, you have hit one of the best. I believe that while the music sounds a little dated in spots, I believe that released today it would still sell songs. Perhaps it might even influence younger artists.<br /><br />Go buy this CD if you have yet to do so. It is one of pop-rock's greats!<br /><br />Enjoy!some songs, this song is flawed in that it could have been twice as long and even then it might not have been long enough.

B0001L3MI0|3.0|1996, a presidential election year with a very much criticized President, Bill Clinton, and a strong conservative movement building up in the wings to impose later on a republican president that would sell a vision  of the world drawn from the apocryphal gospel of some christian born again that is no saint at all. But you have to put this vision on the market, peddle it to innocent customers and prepare the public to the total war it would justify and bring upon Americans, with eventually thousands of dead totally collateral victims. This film is part of this « cultural » strategy to make us believe the US are under attack and has to go to war and pay the sacrificial price of this war and its victory. In other words it was paving the way to the election, by the Supreme Court first and later with a minority of the popular vote, of George W. Bush and his war on terrorism, on Afghanistan and on Iraq. Luckily the infernal mechanism seems to have come to a gripped halt, to a citizen-inspired grasp of reason, in time to avoid two or three more wars on who knows what and whom. The result is a schmaltzy waltz with invading extra-terrestrials. Nothing is orginal. The basic idea comes from Ronald Lafayette Hubbard and his Battle Earth, without the basic idea that human beings are slaves and must not be destroyed because they can be exploited, without the long and fundamental initiative coming from the deepest depth of the human species to build up a counter-offensive and the reconquest of liberty. The Extra-terrestrials are copied from so many other productions that it is nearly an icon of visual and pictorial plagiarism. And the victory is borrowed from H.G. Wells and his War of the Worlds in the form of a virus, this time a computer virus. That's a creative twist, isn't it, in other words spam ? The actors try to do what they can but it is so incredible that they seem to be acting with a tongue, or maybe two or three tongues, in their cheeks. When Hollywood goes to war in the political field, it can be pretty bad and unbearably unethical. Every producer and director is not Charlie Chaplin, not even Jeff Goldblum, thanks God for it, otherwise we would effectively, efficaciously and effectfully be sold any kind of adventurous caper on the international stage. Though in this case this campaign succeeded quite well, even if it seems to have come to an end.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonnethe political field, it can be pretty bad and unbearably unethical.

B000IOM1RI|4.0|Tenacious D's first album was by far one of the most original and funny albums ever released, but this album takes several steps back.  The Musicianship is still excellent, the metal portions still rock, but the vocals and songs just don't work on album like the past album.  This will set well for the movie soundtrack.  Some of this material is reminiscent of stuff off the masterworks, which had some of their really early stuff on it, which was not as polished.  More could have been done with this soundtrack, like a little less pointless swearing (annoying after a bit, Jack needs to learn that silence in sertain parts is OK, he doesn't need to fill it.)   Otherwise, still has several songs that are just darn funny, and Dio's appearence on here is priceless.  Pick this up while you can in the limited edition 3d front.
B000I5X81K|5.0|\\"And I never want to let you down<br />Forgive me if I slip away<br />Sometimes it's hard to find the ground<br />Cause I keep on falling as I try to get away<br />From this crazy world\\"<br />~February Song<br /><br />There is no denying the beauty of Josh Groban's voice and his song writing reveals a profound reflective side we could feel was there all along. The lyrics on his new album are all deeply romantic and idealistic with sweeping lush textures and enveloping intoxication. It takes about three intense listening experiences for this CD to appear in its full beauty.<br /><br />This offering is much easier to listen to and many of the songs are in English and this brings an understanding to the romantic nature of the music on a different level.<br /><br />\\"She stares through my shadow<br />She sees something more<br />Believes there's a light in me<br />She is sure<br />And her truth makes me stronger\\"<br />~In Her Eyes<br /><br />Josh Groban still seems to be finding his way to a definitive style and this is like a bridge from one form to another as he finds his way into song writing and tempering his powerful voice to convey his poetry.<br /><br />\\"So She Dances\\" felt much more personal and Josh Groban captivates with heart-felt emotion and vocal ecstasy that melts the listener while you are on a visual journey. It is evocative and filled with longing.<br /><br />\\"She moves with the music<br />The song is her lover<br />The melody's making her cry<br />So she dances<br />In and out of the crowd like a glance<br />This romance is<br />From afar calling me silently\\"<br />~So She Dances<br /><br />\\"Machine\\" is a little edgy and exciting and \\"Now or Never\\" is sexy but with an element of intuitive understanding and Imogen Heap style. I like the way he says \\"now or never.\\"  \\"You are Loved\\" is breathlessly beautiful although the song takes off in unexpected places.<br /><br />Josh Groban's voice seems to transcend any musical style and his beauty refuses to be tied down or captured. His voice is the music and I'm looking forward to more of his original lyrics on future albums. Like anything worth waiting for, Josh Groban's music appears more beautiful each time you play this CD. From the revelations in \\"February Song,\\" it seems Josh is well on his way to finding his own style.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewthing worth waiting for, Josh Groban's music appears more beautiful each time you play this CD.

B000I5X824|4.0|This greatest hits really does do a good job on covering the span of Staind's career, getting some of the radio single hits, and utilizing most of the CD (16 tracks, mine has 18 with 2 bonus tracks from a chain store). This has all the hits like mudshovel, home, epiphany, outside, ect...but adds bonuses like Comfortably Numb (pink floyd cover, Sober (tool cover), schizophrenic conversations, and Nutshell (Alice in Chains cover).  I can't give it five stars because it doesn't have songs like JUST GO on it, or a few of the others.  Worth picking up, especially for a new fan.  Old fans will enjoy it to, cause of the rarer acoustic stuff.
006085880X|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult book I've ever read, and I certainly wasn't disappointed.  It was very well written, and hard to put down.  The jail scenes were a definite eye opener and the court room drama was riviting.  Jodi definitely is knowledgeable about the subjects she writes about.  I'm glad she had Chris tell the complete truth about Emily's death.  And I think he was deserving of the verdict.  All in all, a truly wonderful read.

B000002P5W|5.0|Yes, some Jimi Hendrix fans might think, what, Axis, Bold as Love is superior to the guitar meistro's groundbreaking lp??  Yes! I say that because if you compare the two albums, you actually hear superior song, lyric and guitar playing on the second album. The first lp does have the mindblowing Are You Experienced? and Third Stone from the Sun psychedelic extravangas. But the second lp has much better defined tunes which also percolate with psychedelic abandon. If you listen very closely to the first lp, there are recording shotcomings that were not edited out because of a \\"rush to market\\" and \\"cut down on recording expenses\\" mentality driven by manager, Chas Chandler. On the second lp, even though Hendrix lost the original masters for the second half of the lp, you hear no production mistakes at all. And you have Hendrix's writing much more poignant lyrics about the importance of individuality and self-expression. Jimi, if anything, is much more political on this album than on his first and its reflected in the lyrics. But the quality of the \\"pop songs\\" I like even more than on the first album. The trio is extremely tight on the second album, almost tighter than on the first. Mitch's drumming is lock, stock and barrel with Jimi's superlative rhythm guitar playing and Noel provides the solid bass lines. This second album packs a powerful punch! Little Wing lives on into eternity with the most beatific guitar intro of any rock/pop song ever recorded! The Axis track is so powerful! If anything, this album is guilty of being too short!  And you can blame this again on the frugal mentality of Chas Chandler who always kept a tight leash on Hendrix, preventing him from really stretching out on songs. Several of the songs on Axis could have been longer and did not have to fade out as quickly as they did. Axis itself should have continued for at least several more minutes. I thank Chas for discovering Hendrix and I also blame him for keeping Hendrix inside too small of a box. Hendrix himself hated the 2 or 3 minute pop song, hence his hugely successful rejection of that format with the titanic Electric Ladlyland lp featuring several long, extended forays into blues/psychedelia.....But enjoy Axis. It ranks as one of the BEST rock/blues/psychedelic lps produced in the late sixties period!x.

B00005JPAD|4.0|Two years after his beautiful film \\"The Aviator\\", director Martin Scorsese is back with the crimefilm \\"The Departed\\"   Stepping out of the darkend theater just this morning, the film has left a big impression in my mind. The way Scorsese has remade the chinese film \\"Internal Affairs\\" is a true present for movie fans.    The story follows Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) who goes undercover in the Irish mob group of Frank Costello (Nicholson) in Boston. But Costello also has a man on the inside at the policeforce named Colin Sullivan (Damon). When both the Policeforce as Costello discover that they have a rat somewhere in there crew, both undercover men try to keep their identity secret and keep themselfs alive while the search is on on both sides of the law for the rat...           The casting of this well filmed story is maqnificent. First there is DiCaprio. The way he plays the leadcharacter in a strong and impressive style shows that DiCaprio is one of the finest actors of Hollywood these days. Matt Damon plays his role with his own take on it and gives a great performance. Jack Nicholson, as always, delivers. The legendary actor plays his role of mobboss Frank Costello in a fantastic, sometimes even scary way that intimidates the audience. Mark Wahlberg as the hardedge cop Dignam was a fine casting choice as well. Last but not least there is Martin Sheen as Oliver Queenan who knows how to portray his character in a good way. In the surporting roles there are Alec Baldwin and Vera Farmiga who also give nice performances.  In short: an ultimate dream cast of all fine actors in a row which gives more than just a movie, it gives an everlasting masterpiece.     As you can expect from a Scorsese picture, the violence is brutal, bloody and stays at a realistic level. Even though there isn't that much action in the film, there are enough thrilling situations like the conversations between the characters to keep the audience entertained. The way that the different conversationsand situations are edited flows nicely and gives a great atmosphere.  The 2 and a half hour length of the film is perfectly build up and leaves no boring moments cause of the interesting actors that give their best in every single scene. Beautiful shots with great cameramovements, great lighting and sets make the film complete and gives an unforgetable movie experience.       The story, the characters, the tense situations keep you interested and hooked for 2 and a half hours of an interesting cat and mouse game that starts fullspeed and continues on a straight track right to a jawdropping finish. Drama, Crime and Thriller fans: see this film, this is the way a movie has to be done.    Scorsese shows once again that he is one of the true masters in the filmbusiness.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|Alot of A7X fans may have been disapponted in the change of style from \\"Waking the Fallen\\", but to me, all this album does is prove just how immense the talent level of this band is. It almost sounds like a whole different band at some points. You won't find any screaming, but you will still find the same awesome guitar work A7X is known for. Aside from repeatedly listening to Bat Country and Seize the Day, Sidwinder really grabbed me. I love the tempo/style change torwards the end of the song. A couple of the songs do seem to drag on a bit, and I do prefer \\"Waking the Fallen\\", but this is still a great album, and definitely worth buying.
B000068FWC|5.0|I have long wished for a lot of my favorite classic albums to be re-mastered, or even totally re-recorded or remixed.  (That honor goes to Cheap Trick's \\"Dream Police\\", which, after the thunderous \\"Live At Budokan\\" sounds like it was recorded and mastered on a transistor radio.)<br /><br />  Supertramp hit the bigtime with \\"Breakfast In America\\", their most commercial but in many ways the most satisfying release of their career.<br /><br />AOR radio especially drooled over \\"The Logical Song\\", still one of the catchiest pop songs ever, and \\"Take The Long Way Home\\" also lit up the airwaves.<br /><br />  Of course, the signature keyboards and the high pitched voice of Roger Hodgson defined Supertramp, with Rick Davies' huskier voice adding the essential balance.  Like other great sixties and seventies bands, rock fans revelled in their favorite groups' originality and presentation.  For example, no one could confuse KISS with Rush, but both rocked.  Now, we find a tedious blandness that permeates music that helps classic rock live and makes alternative stations so boring.<br /><br />  What made rock and roll great was individuality; no one could ever replicate \\"Breakfast In America\\".  However, with a spiky 'do and pants around your ankles, you could literally cop hundreds of rappers, alternative and hip hop bands.<br /><br />  No modern band could paint an aural picture of Depression-era New York during the middle part of the title track like Supertramp.  You can practically see the old man pushing an apple cart down Mulberry Street during this tune.<br /><br />  It's wonderful to see this CD remastered and still available, but it's sad to see how few musicians dare to make a difference any more.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins refuses to don kid gloves in his discussion of gods and religions in \\"The God Delusion\\" and for that he has been castigated by some critics.  Yet, Dawkins' polemic is a much-needed addition to the honest discussion of the negative aspects of religious belief. At a time when such beliefs are used as the pretext for the commission of terrible atrocities and the attempted deconstruction of the rational edifice of science and technology that holds so much promise for humankind, such discussion is critical to the future of human societies.  <br /> <br />Dawkins is a brilliant writer and, with the death of Carl Sagan 10 years ago, has moved to the forefront of advocates for science and reason. He is, perhaps, the world's best-known atheist. In \\"The God Delusion,\\" Dawkins offers a devastating critique of the pretensions of religion. Those who see any honest discussion of religion as an attack on faith only reveal the weakness of their own position. We desparately need an honest conversation about religions and their role in human cultures. We can't have one as long as the religious insist on donning a mantle of self-righteous indignation whenever the subject is broached.  <br /> <br />This book is not about a war between science and religion. It is about a war between reason and superstition. Dawkins makes a clear case for reason and offers no apology for attacking some of humankind's most cherished superstitions. <br /> <br />And after all, why should he?
0790729644|5.0|Not only one of the best westerns, but one of the best films ever made.  This insightful look at the human condition as it existed in the 1880s West is graced with a superb script, incredible photography, truly exceptional acting, and a universal theme that reminds us that \\"we've all got it comin' kid.\\"  Proof that Clint Eastwood is an all-time great artist in the media of film.  By all means, watch it.  Think about it.<br /><br />This film is somewhat violent, and it offers a searing image of what [we think] life was like in the open freedom of the frontier West, so sought after by many restless Americans.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|With the realease of his Freshmen \\"O\\" 4 years ago, Damien Rice has only overshadowed himself with his Sophmore album \\"9\\".  This album has a lot of attitude, it is a lot more dark sounding then the first and it is a long time coming from this break through artist.  Songs that stick out are the tracks 9 Crimes, Elephant, Dogs, and Grey Room.  Still though, Rice pours his voice and soul into every second of every song, even in the song Rootless Tree (which sounds like the lyrics were written by a 14 year old) when song by him sounds remarkable. If you enjoyed \\"O\\" at all, and his B-Sides, this will fit right into your collection.
B000HBKCDC|1.0|This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I've been following this artist for a few years now. It strikes me that \\"Awake\\" is a journey of self discovery - the risks that Josh has taken to detour from his classical pop type of formula into something that is more reflecting of his own heart and soul.  He said that in recent interviews that this project is not about being what he isn't, but this is about not being afraid to be everything that he is. That really says it all.  Those who've been following him since his debut CD certainly could feel the difference between this album and his previous releases; I especially like the original songs such as \\"Awake\\" (title track yet only included in the Special Edition of the CD), \\"February Song\\", and the surprising \\"Machine\\", but I also love the South African pop \\"Weeping\\" with brand new interpretation, \\"Lullaby\\" which was sung a capella, and the melodramatic \\"In Your Eyes\\" - the list could go on. Yet personally I feel that the selection of songs in foreign languages could be further reduced - Josh has said he wanted to include 4 but he wound up having 5, 6 if you count \\"Verita\\" in the Special Edition. Much as I like the romance and poetry expressed in some of these songs, the resulting \\"chemisty\\" from those songs are somehow too \\"expected\\".
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie aired almost 7 years ago and I think about it often.  The metaphor of this movie is amazing! The enlightenment of waking up and seeing the world for what it really is versus swallowing the dogma that has been fed to you your entire life is as drastic of a rebirth experience as this movie makes it out to be.  All of that thrown into one hell of a story, soundtrack, cast, trilogy, etc.  Wow!! trully amazing.  A classic by any measure.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|1) This is probably the best collection KISS has ever put out <br />2) Yes, I also had most of it, but the sound & image here is way better. If you are the kind of fan who hasn't visited the black market for bootleg footage all these years... YOU MIGHT DIE OF AN OVERDOSE OF HAPPINESS while watching this set.   <br />3) Audio commmentaries (I wish I had also Peter & Ace speaking), (not so) hidden footage, 3 dvd's, MORE-THAN-FABULOUS MENUS!! Terrific, rare pictures on the booklet, an insert, great packaging was well ... and this is just Volume 1! <br />4) Some people say the sound & image is terrible, that they found better copies in bootleg format. Well, my advice is NEVER CHANGE YOUR DEALER, because he must be the most adorable man on Earth

But otherwise, Bill Bryson is as hilarious as ever, and the book is great fun and highly entertaining. The insights into daily US life are very telling and also social history. Some things make you think, but they all make you laugh, too. Nobody need be offended, but everybody should be delighted!
B0007ZEO4G|5.0|Great version of the band here. There is a big discussion going on about the presence of funk on Burn.  In the traditional blues, rock sense I guess you could say there's a funkier sound with this line up but it isn't funk in terms of parliment or mainstream disco (prevalent at the time).<br /><br />This is still a straight ahead rock and roll cd that can in no way be lumped in with anything else.  The title track and Sail Away are two stand out tracks.

B0000TB03W|5.0|I recently purchased this DVD and thought it was great! Shania let's her band share the spotlight on stage. Most acts these days seem to push the band members to the background. Not Shania,they are right up front with her.There are many shots of the audience which helps give you a feel of being there in Grant Park. It was also a nice touch to invite members of the audience on stage several of times. I not a real fan of country music;however this is an excellent concert! <br /> <br /> Being a Canadian,I'm proud Shania is also from Canada. She is very much appreciated here! <br />
B00000JBFW|5.0|This might be my favorite Deep Purple release.  Why?  Maybe it's because I love the 80's.<br /><br />These guys came back with guns blazing. Perfect Strangers hit the music scene with a sound that was both a throwback to Deep Purple's glory days and a perfect fit for the emerging pop metal scene.  Happily, I've seen very few negative reviews for this cd.  Glad to see the general Deep Purple fan base agreeing with me.<br /><br />Beyond the rating system.
B000HA4W4S|5.0|I have never heard such a compact album of songs that are so catchy. Not one syllable of lyrics is wasted, not one chord progression gone awry. Absolutely incredible! Definitely indulge yourself with a big heaping helping of this fun CD.
B00006F83Y|3.0|\\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is kind of a dissapointment, when it comes to \\"Stoner Rock\\" Even though the genere isn't filled with that many bands, there are better albums to listen to in this genere. \\"Clutch\\", Fu-Man-Chu\\", \\"Monster Magnet\\", \\"Entombed\\" and \\"Kyruss\\" (members from QOTSA are present here, or should I say, before QOTSA) are much better. This is a basic album, with nothing to special. I was expecting a bit more variety, and some more jams, but at times the album starts to drag through the mud. Its not a bad album, its just not as good as I believe it could be, considering there are some great muscians on this album
B000J103X4|4.0|I know you all rapers have to eat, so does the GAME, he waited and droped this, i agree that its not \\"Documentry\\" but still its good,He praises his Mentor The great DR Dre alot, and thats OK too. <br />I will still by it, \\"Strip Club' is awsome. <br />I have nothing against G-unit, i even like the bank,s flow,but this is way better the Banks and Buck solo,s combine. <br /> <br />East or west, Gangsta Rap is best.
B0009UC7H0|5.0|Where are all these bad reviews coming from?? Sahara is better than the Indiana Jones adventures...better filmed, more plausible (but REALLY, when was storyline plausibility necessary to enjoy a movie), better directed, etc. The chemistry was great between Matthew McConaughy and his sidekick, Steve Zahn, as ex-military divers for treasure. Just a pleasure to watch again and again.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|Diana Krall's best Christmas song is \\"Young, Lonesome Soldier\\", and it's not on this CD.  As I listened to \\"Christmas Songs\\", I kept thinking, \\"this is ok, but X does it better\\".  \\"Jingle Bells\\".  Streisand's is better.  \\"Let it Snow\\".  Manhattan Transfer is better.  \\"Winter Wonderland\\".  Amy Grant does it better.   \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\".  Karen Carpenter's version is better.   \\"What are you doing New Year's\\".  Steve Tyrell  has a better version.  OK, she's the best on \\"Chrismas Time is here\\" and matches the best on a couple of others. But overall, it's not as good as I'd hoped.  Maybe there are so few standard Christmas songs that it's hard to do something really new.   <br />
B0002NRQTS|4.0|Presto brought a bit of a change to Rush again, as it seemed the band was starting to ditch the synths and start getting back to basics again. Even though this Rush album is a bit corney on the lyrical end, I think it was something that we had to expect. Gone were the days of the 20 minute anthems, and it was apparent from \\"Power Windows\\" that the band was moving in bit of a diffrent direction. This isnt't the greatest album by Rush, but its pretty damn good. It seems to be unappricated by Rush fans, but most of us all have our unappricated album. I myself, think this is the one that is under-rated, yet some like \\"Roll the Bones\\" and \\"Test for Echo\\" as thier under-rated classics. I happen to hate those albums, so this is my pick. Even though we dont all agree on thier newer material, we all pretty much agree that all their 70's albums were excellent. If I were just getting in to the band, I wouldnt start here, but I would add it in your collection once you start you Rush libary, as I think you will like it, even though it will really come up on your top five of Rush albums, its there if you want to here some more solid \\"modern\\" Rush.

B00006LFGD|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Barbra Streisand in concert last night in San Jose's HP Pavilion, a truly once-in-a-lifetime occasion for an unabashed fan. En route to whet my appetite, I listened to this career-spanning compendium of nineteen stellar duets she performed. Ever the chameleon when it comes to breaking down musical genres and styles, Streisand makes not only her vocal versatility evident but her amazing consistency in the nearly four decades that separate the earliest track, the classic 1963 duet with Judy Garland on \\"Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again\\" to the two songs she recorded specifically for this disc in 2002 (her fortieth anniversary with Columbia Records). They appropriately open and close the disc - the opener is a swooning, gushy ballad with fellow crooner Barry Manilow (\\"I Won't Be the One to Let Go\\"), and the closer is a more stentorian operatic dirge with forty-years younger lyric baritone Josh Groban singing in Italian (\\"You're All I Know of Love\\").<br /><br />In between is quite a musical hodgepodge that Streisand's expert vocalism somehow pulls together. She fluidly moves from the swinging, watusi-driven treatment of Harold Arlen's \\"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\\" (yes, from \\"The Wizard of Oz\\"), a rarely heard 1966 novelty with the composer himself, to circling around Kris Kristofferson's whiskey-soaked bellow on \\"Lost Inside of You\\" from \\"A Star Is Born\\" to maneuvering the stuck-in-the-eighties bombast of \\"Make No Mistake, He's Mine\\" with scratchy-voiced Kim Carnes to taking the high road on the diva battle royale with an overly competitive Celine Dion on the melodramatic \\"Tell Him\\". Perhaps too familiar, several of the tracks have already been accepted into the 20th century American pop pantheon: the two Barry Gibb duets from her pop blitzkrieg of Bee Gees melisma, \\"Guilty\\"; the self-pity marital anthem, \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\" with fellow Erasmus Hall classmate Neil Diamond; the ornate theatricality of \\"Music of the Night\\" with the original Phantom, Michael Crawford; and the torch-passing currents of poignancy and urgency with the Garland duet.<br /><br />Sure, a couple of tracks border on kitsch now, though they remain infectious - the scorn-ridden disco inferno of \\"Enough Is Enough\\" with Donna Summer and the bill-and-cooing with former lover Don Johnson on the  &uuml;ber-romantic \\"Till I Loved You\\".  And a few have actually improved over time - \\"I Finally Found Someone\\", which pairs her surprisingly well with pop-rocker Bryan Adams, and the summit meeting with fellow icon Frank Sinatra in his obvious twilight on \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\". However, the best duet is the one she does with herself on the resplendent Burt Bacharach/Hal David medley of \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\" and \\"A House Is Not a Home\\", an inarguable pop masterpiece providing the perfect mix of arrangement, orchestration and overdub tracks with the songstress at her most sublime. It does seem ironic that Streisand's best partner is herself but at the same time, quite fitting.the original Phantom, Michael Crawford; and the torch-passing currents of poignancy and urgency with the Garland duet. <br /> <br />Sure, a couple of tracks border on kitsch now, though they remain infectious - the scorn-ridden disco inferno of \\"Enough Is Enough\\" with Donna Summer and the bill-and-cooing with former lover Don Johnson on the  über-romantic \\"Till I Loved You\\".

0887081770|4.0|We like looking at the moon and this book helps to open conversation with my child about the moon. The story was neat in the sense that the father really is adventurous in retrieving the moon.<br />Only thing that wasn't so great about the book is the large flaps that are a little confusing as to which direction in which they should be opened. My son almost ripped one of the pages trying to figure it out.
B0000640VN|5.0|I've never really understood the whole Meg Ryan phenomenon until I saw this movie. In this movie, she plays a time traveling career woman who's attitude and sassiness are bursting with comic possibilities. Hugh Jackman plays the love interest who she loves. He's the inventor of the elevator. And their loves has its ups and downs! yes! Get it? Ups and Downs? Elevator. They go up and down? Anyhoo, Meg Ryan shows off some acting chops that have never before surfaced in her previous roles. I want to say she gave a riveting performance. But I can't, because it would be a lie and I never lie.<br /><br />I've often dreamed what happens to a cute actress who's made one too many movies in the same formula. Now I don't have to dream anymore! Thanks you Meg Ryan for squashing my dreams.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|I don't know what the heck all these people are complaining about!!! The show didn't REVOLVE around the songs played. Some episodes don't even HAVE this \\"special music\\" everyone keeps referring to. I Love the episodes and the show and could care less what the music is playing in the background when Brandon is looking for a job, or when they dance at the slumber party for like 30 seconds!!! WHO CARES!! If you're a TRUE fan of the show, the music will not affect the plot and characters the way everyone is making it out to be this TRAGEDY.
B00000AFDW|4.0|Sure, it's not pure, classic lineup Kiss,(session musicians, etc) but just taking it for what is...this album is actually not bad when you get down to it. Great songs and energetic performances all over the place... \\"Within\\", \\"You Wanted The Best\\" and \\"Journey Of 1,000 Years\\" are all inspired, atmospheric songs, and highly melodic. Bruce Fairbairn's production here is excellent, and while polished, it's tight and hard rockin'...and all the vocal performances by every member of the band are top-notch, just superb. Gene's vocals on the psychedelic epic \\"Within\\" and the Beatle-esque, acoustic sing-along, \\"We Are One\\" are especially passionate. And the high powered anthem, \\"You Wanted The Best\\", is a blast, featuring all 4 trading verses, and a drum pattern lifted from 70's glitter kings, The Sweet.  In the end it all comes down to the songwriting. I will say that the title track, and \\"I Pledge Allegiance To The State Of Rock & Roll\\" are great tunes, especially \\"I Pledge\\", which features a signature \\"Rock And Roll!\\" vocal from Paul at the climax. The title track is a great song.  Ace's \\"Into The Void\\" is a classic, upbeat, straight rocker,(Peter plays drums on this, which is nice to hear), and again an effective vocal performance from Ace. Peter's vocal on the Paul Stanley/Bob Ezrin penned ballad \\"I Finally Found My Way\\" is also a highlight, featuring The Catman's soulful and raspy style. It's a good ballad, kind of like \\"Beth\\" part II. The closing \\"Journey Of 1,000 Years\\" is a grand epic, a melodic monster of a track, with a theatrical flair that sums up the Psycho Circus atmosphere perfectly, well done, Gene. \\"Circus\\" is a cross between Destroyer and Dynasty.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I was one of the first in my home city, Perth australia to pick this album up, i had already heard the title track and i couldn't wait to get the full album. when i did finally get it, i wasn't disappointed, it is very different with the heavy rock sounds, like the 1st Bat in 1977 was, nobody had ever seen, or heard anything like Meat, with Steinmans exellent song writing, and now he's done it again, there may not be as much input from jim, but he's still there. I am only 18 and i love all Meats work, and unlike most my age i am not into the grunge, R&B and modern music, but i love Bat III. Meats voice still being as strong as ever mixed with the new sounds make this a truely awesome finish to rocks mightyest franchise. To use Meats famous words, Don't ever stop rockin Meat! cos the world wouldn't be the same.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|With the release of O, Damien Rice made some of the most beautiful, yet haunting, music in recent memory. He even won the Shortlist Music Prize for the album back in 2003. Of course that award is a blessing and a curse because it means you're really good but you haven't sold very many records (less than 500,000 to be eligible). But the album did have some staying power as many with songs showing up in different movies and television shows, most recently Delicate was used to close out an episode of Jericho two weeks ago. This wasn't first time the song was used for ending an episode because as it was also done previously on Lost and Alias. Gee it's not like television producers to use songs that have been used multiple times before for the same reasons. End sarcasm. <br /> <br />Just when you think Rice couldn't come up with a more simplistic title for an album than O, he does with the release today of 9. The new album is much of the same as the songs still manage to be beautiful and haunting at the same time. Although the songs sound a little more polished this time around, they don't lose their emotional rawness and even with all the emotion seeping from the songs they still avoid being sappy. And before you make a The Blower's Daughter comparison to Elephant, Rice beat you to the punch as it was originally titled The Blower's Daughter II before the title was changed during recording. <br /> <br />Lisa Hannigan, who shined on O's Volcano, is back and featured on the album opener 9 Crimes but unfortunately is relegated to backup singer for the rest of the album because their back and forth is always something great. That's not to say Rice can't handle a track by himself. He even branches out on the album with the harder sounding Rootless Tree and Me, My Yoke & I with all the rage, screaming and lyrics that wouldn't get past my censors. Then on Coconut Skins, Rice straps on an acoustic guitar and channels early Dylan. And be sure to turn up the volume when the albumends because the last sixteen minutes features a Tibetan singing bowl that supposable has healing powers. But it's The Animals Are Gone with its soft beginning into a souring orchestral ending that will most like be co-opted that will likely be closing out an episode of your favorite television shows for years to come.
1896597890|5.0|If there is one thing I'm sick of it's superheroes.  Being an avid fan of the medium and a comic collector since i was 12 I've been guilt of the superhero syndrome.  I still read a few superhero books, they exist,there out there but it's books like this that give me faith that the medium is not dead and can still evolve.  Guy Delisle has put together a great piece of work.  I remember living in divided Berlin when i was a kid and my father was stationed there.  I got to take a trip into East Berlin after the wall fell but before reunification and it was surreal.  Like the images you used to see one side of the wall was graffitied and decorated the other was painted white to help people show up better if they tried to escape.  That same eerieness rings through this novel.  To see the poor and starving afraid and brainwashed but still trying to put on a face of superiority is all they know.  What will happen if north and south ever reunify here?  This is book is all the more interesting with the current events that have taken place.  Not only is this story captivating but Guy's artwork will truly amaze you.  I wish i could draw like this all the time.
B000GUJYRE|5.0|I was just given this set of Beethoven's symphonies as a birthday present and I have to say it has taken me back to my high school days when I first discovered how exciting classical music can be.  This is an outstanding recording on many levels.  Bernard Haitink's interpretation is refreshing, insightful and authoritative. That interpretation combined with the excellent musicianship of the LSO and the stellar sound quality (even though it's live) captured by the engineers makes this recording a revelation.  I say a revelation even though these 9 symphonies are the best known of symphonic works.  I keep hearing nuances that I've always known were there, but that were never quiet captured by previous recordings and I keep catching myself thinking \\"Yes! That's the way to do it\\", or \\"Wow, brilliant!\\".  The only qualm I've had has been the rapid speed Haitink takes on the first movement of the 5th.   <br /> <br />I've never had an opinion on the LSO, either positive of negative, but that changed after hearing this.  Every section, from strings, to horns to percussion, has astounded me at some point during these recordings.  But more impressive, and important to me, is the unity with which Haitink pulls that musicianship together throughout.  This \\"over-the-top\\"  review is out of character for me since I frequently find myself tied to past memories of recordings from the 40s to 60s, however, this recording deserves that praise and I hope it's a huge success for Haitink and the LSO.  If you do buy this, you'll find yourself air-conducting like never before, or, like me, entering your second classical childhood.  <br />
B000007ODL|5.0|JJ Cale is a songwriter best known for having his works covered by other artists like Eric Clapton, Deep Purple and Lynyrd Skynyrd. While I don't generally favor 'best of' albums prefering to dig into an artists body of work, this one stands as an exception. It's a wonderful introduction to the world of JJ Cale with his layed back bluesy guitar sound and country-like sensabilities.<br /><br />An excellent look into the world of JJ Cale. Highly recommended.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|I don't think any second album could come close to touching \\"O.\\"  I think that many would agree that \\"O,\\" as an entire album, was simply superb on almost every level, from voice to emotive content, to instrumentation.  With his first album, Rice accomplished what most singers only dream of doing.  It is also important to remember that Rice had a lifetime to write, tweak, and practice some of the first songs on \\"0\\".  I recently listened to a bootleg version of \\"Volcano\\" from Rice's \\"B-sides.\\"  It was recorded in 1997, but \\"0\\" wasn't released until 2002. One might worry that all of Rice's best work has already been released.  I do not think this is the case...I simply think we all just need to lower our absurdly high expectations with \\"9.\\"  If you think about it, how could it come close to \\"0\\"? <br /> <br />That said, \\"9\\" comes about as close as could be hoped.  Goosebumps ran up and down my spine when Rice finally comes in in the middle of \\"9 crimes\\" on the first track.   <br /> <br />Let's put it this way, if \\"9\\" was Rice's first album, editors and reviewers would be going nuts singing Rice's praises.  But, in comparison to \\"0,\\" \\"9\\" is only very very good.  What else could it be?

B000I5X80G|4.0|For those that embrace some sustained grungy noise, this is a nice addition, what it lacks in length it makes up for, by a factor of 10, in authenticity.

B000I5X80G|4.0|First off this is a great set of the second half of the show with the original Crazy Horse containing Danny Whitten on lead guitar just over a year from his death. I frankly see no problem with releasing several concert versions of songs at various points in Young's career, heck the Grateful Dead have been doing it for years to much acclaim.<br /><br />What really makes me a bit peeved are two things. First this is only half the show and there's no reason for it to not contain the accoustic set. It makes no sense as there are bootlegs out there of the full set from the 1970 tour and this comes off as rather skimpy. Second, why is it taking so long to release the much touted archives to fans? I understand perfectionism but this is getting a bit ridiculous.<br /><br />It's a fine live set that's a bit skimpy. Worth a buy if you've not heard the bootlegs from that era.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Thought-provoking and powerful music. Heard an interview with him on a local radio talk show recently and thought he was funny, so went out and bought the CD. I have not purchased his other CD's, if this one sounds different, than different is better. Best cuts are 'February Song' and 'Weeping' with a South African ensemble- I love this song- crank up the stereo and hear the clear voice. Not crazy about Track 13 Machine.   What a talented person, great to see him branch out. This man is going to go far. Pick up copies of this as GIFTS.   Great job Josh!
B000J103X4|5.0|22 months since his classic \\"The Documentary\\" Game is off G-Unit/Aftermath and without Dr. Dre but brings us another classic or near-classic album, not quite as good as \\"Documentary\\" but not far behind.  With 16 songs you get 2 near classics, 2 ok songs, and the other 12 are good, and mostly great songs.  Guests are on 5 songs rapping and a few more doing the hooks.  Production is great.  Scott Storch, Jonathen Rotem, and Just Blaze each do 2 songs.  Ervin Pope, DJ Khalil, Reefa, Will I Am, Kanye West, Swizz Beats, Hi-Tek, Nottz, Kon Artis, Jelly Roll all do 1 song.  Much better then I'd thought it would be and possibly a top 5 album of 2006 so far (Ghostface's \\"Fishscale\\", Pimp C's \\"Pimpalation, Lake & Cormega's \\"My Brother's Keeper\\", Method Man's \\"4:21... The Day After\\", South Central Cartel's \\"Random Violence\\", Bars & Hooks \\"Most Notorious\\" & AZ's \\"Teh Format\\" - are some other high points from this year - we still have Nas, 2Pac, Snoop, Styles, Z-Ro, Jay-Z, and Clipse in the next 7 weeks though).  A Must have Album.    #1 - 9 (f/ Traci nelson -- tight beat - would maybe be a classic if not for Mac Minister's 45 seconds of talking in the middle of the song)  #2 - 7 (f/ traci Nelson)  #3 - 8.5   #4 - 8.5 (nice beat)  #5 - 8.5 (good beat)  #6 - 8  #7 - 9 (f/ Nate Dogg -- nice beat)  #8 - 9 (f/ Kanye West -- Game disses a lot of women on this one)  #9 - 8  #10- 7.5  #11 - 9.5 (f/ Busta Rhymes & Shorty -- very deep song addressed to Dr. Dre)  #12 - 9.5 (another deep song)  #13 - 9 (f/ Snoop Dogg & Xzibit -- nice beat)  #14 - 9 (f/ Kurupt & Daz Dillinger -- nice beat)  #15 - 9 (f/ Jamie Foxxx -- tight beat)  #16 - 8 (f/ nas & Floetry)    Jayceon Taylor -- b. 1980 -- Compton, CA  Check all my reviews
B000002USN|1.0|As a Sinatra fan, I can tell you that this does not represent his best output. I hate to be cynical but part of me wonders if this album was prompted by a desire to squeeze just a bit more cash out of some tired old numbers.  There was no point getting Sinatra to re-record a selection of favourites - he was too old and his voice had all but gone (let's face it).  So why not get him to croak a few lines and then fill in the gaps with some lesser stars and then market it as a duets album? <br /> <br />The instrumental arrangements and the band itself are great.  But the singing is at best uninteresting and at worst laughable.  The duet with Bono is a complete joke, the one with Barbara Streisand tedious and uninspiring.  In fact, just about the only one that is at all enjoyable is the duet of Summer Wind with Julio Iglesias.  No, this is not a good album and the third-rate quality of it is highlighted by the rumour that Sinatra pre-recorded his bits and the others filled in the gaps later. I find that very easy to believe. <br /> <br />There are so many good Sinatra albums and collections around, so why would you bother with this offering?  Go listen to him in his prime.
0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck either writes short, tight novels or long, intense sagas. At over 600 pages, \\"East of Eden\\" is the latter.<br /><br />\\"East of Eden\\" is my new favorite Steinbeck novel. It is the story of two brothers, Adam and Caleb (the Cain and Abel allegory is strong here), their parents and Cathy Ames-one of the most manipulative, unfeeling, unscrupolous, complicated villains I have ever encountered in literature.<br /><br />The novel is long and dense and much of it is \\"the set up\\" for how the rest of the novel plays out. It is such a pleasure to read. There is no author (except perhaps Buck in The Good Earth) who weaves character growth, morality, allegory and geophraphy together so beautifully.<br /><br />Read this book!

B000I5X824|4.0|I am a bit older(a classic rock fan before we knew it was going to be classic). When I purchase music from most of the nineties bands that I am only aquainted with from radio etc. I prefer to buy a greatest hits and delve into the albums proper if I am impressed with what I hear. This is one of those times. I am not going to make the usual comparisons to other bands or scratch my head over why a collection like this is issued by record companies or the like. I just like the music and that is what we listen to it for.

0446577383|3.0|Those who gobble up the latest thrillers - where the threat is nuclear annihilation, the villains are high level government employees and the hero is an x-government super-spy - will undoubtedly love to read this fast pace thriller.<br /><br />Baldacci does a great job of developing a cast of off-beat, odd-ball experts who form the Camel Club to bring down the bad guys. This gang shows up again in Baldacci's latest book, The Collectors.
6305327084|5.0|This is a fine film. The characters are older young adults, barely young enough to be able to characterize this as a \\"rite-of-passage\\" film.  I disagree with those who suggest that the characters ultimately give up on the dreams of their youth and \\"settle\\" for an inevitable and dull adulthood.  From my 58 year old vantage point, they are leaving their shallow and immature adolescence for the deeper and more meaningful commitments to mature, real (not mythologized) partners who love them for who they are. They are ready to embrace their lives both present and future and let go of the ever more distant and irrelevant past.  <br />The Hutton character is certainly tempted by Thurman.  Though he admires and cares for the 13 yr old Portman character, he is always aware that her desire for him will not be returned by him. He relates to her impatience to grow up, recognizes her puppylove feelings for him, but never considers abusing her affection for him. <br />This is a wonderful ensemble cast.  Though more polished than its predecessor, this film reminds me of the early John Sayles film \\"Return Of The Secaucus Seven\\".
B000IU3XTM|4.0|Unlike some reviewers here, I only gave 'O' a 3-star rating because I didn't think Rice lived up to his potential. And much of that album grew on me even more as time went along. On '9' he's clearly coming into his own.<br /><br />The disk purchase would be worth it for \\"9 Crimes\\" alone. It is a great song - and a stunning opener. Like on 'O' Lisa Hannigan makes a great contrast to Rice...especially on the first cut.  There are clearly elements of his first disk on this one (\\"Elephant\\") - but he's definately going a bit more electric (\\"Me, My Yoke and I\\"), which I'm loving.<br /><br />I'm also loving \\"Rootless Tree\\" - though like his 'B-Sides' - Rice is a fan of the explititves (not that there's anything wrong w/it).<br /><br />What I'm not a fan of - and wasn't on the first disk - the long long long song.  22 minutes for \\"Sleep Don't Weep\\"?  The song is ok, but pretty much goes silent from minute 7 on.  I'm not sure of the rationale for this.<br /><br />Via iTunes you get a demo version of '9 Crimes' which is good.  But I almost missed it b/c I thought the disk was over due to 14 minutes of silence.<br /><br />Sample the disk at least, but it's really worth the purchase.  You're never going to hear it on radio.

0393061434|3.0|Clearly, Wozniak's amaneusis Gina Smith intended to present Wozniak as a sort of Noble Savage with genius, and Wozniak was a wise and kind and great man. <br /> <br />But Ms Smith does Wozniak a profound disservice by not fact checking or editing the Homeric story. <br /> <br />The most serious misrepresentation that results is Woz's claim (at the end of chapter 10) that \\"that day, Sunday, June 29, 1975, was pivotal. It was the first time in history that anyone had typed a character on a keyboard and seen it show up on the screen right in front of them\\". <br /> <br />Gina should have fact checked this claim, and, she would have discovered any number of systems where mainframe and minicomputer operators, programmers and users \\"typed a character and saw it on the screen\\". <br /> <br />For example, IBM's \\"Conversational Monitor System\\" supported this facility. <br /> <br />There is a dangerous innocence and orality in Silicon Valley culture in which any number of Noble Savages allow women (it what by 1985 was a profoundly sexist culture) to transmit narratives ultimately self-centered, causing the truly Noble savage to make claims that in honesty he would not make. <br /> <br />Sure, on the mainframe, the character may have made a Bogus Journey to the CPU although by 1975, later models of the IBM 3270 \\"dumb\\" terminal did local computation. <br /> <br />But no matter what sort of contraption handled the phenomena, plenty of people had pressed characters on keyboards, and saw them on a screen.
B000I5X81K|3.0|Well perhaps I'm not a die hard fan of Josh Groban after all.  I found his voice marvelous as usual and the orchestration sublime.  But the selections are boring in that as a whole they are too much the same.  I don't think his full talents shine on this one.
0974872407|5.0|I just finished the book and I can say it's delighting. It is easy to read, has great use of language and it keeps suspense up to the very last moment. Its one of those novels you enjoy throghout the entire reading and want to share with all your friends. Highly recommended. You'll finish it in a weekend.

0451528018|5.0|I had never read a Sherlock Holmes mystery before, nor had I seen a Sherlock Holmes movie. I picked up this book because I like to inject classic pieces into my reading and this had been recommended to me.<br /><br />This did not disappoint! Although very short - just over 200 pages - this novel has a huge impact. I would say this novel is closer to a thriller/mystery, and it includes a cast of potential villains or heroes, a creepy moor, a spooky house, a mysterious curse, and an overall gothic feel. Even though the language is formal, it is easy to feel engaged and the action sweeps the reader into it.<br /><br />There is an absence of Holmes, which I was not expecting, but it makes his appearances in the book all the more intriguing. I had always thought the character of Dr. Watson was more of a foil or a prop, but he plays a very central figure here and that was interesting.<br /><br />What I truly appreciated in this work is that it is a thinking person's mystery. I usually avoid mysteries, especially modern mysteries, because they aren't challenging and I usually solve them partway through the book. This novel allowed for clues to be given, almost like a puzzle, to be thought over and contemplated. I very much enjoyed that.<br /><br />I can now say that I look forward to enjoying more Sherlock Holmes mysteries! I'm eager to find out how the short stories compare to the novel.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I'll be honest and admit that I'd listen to Sarah sing anything given her warm soprano voice. Nevertheless I think this Christmas album is really special, several cuts above the norm for this sort of recording.<br /><br />\\"War Is Over\\" gave her a chance to involve her children's choir with whom she's been working with many years, and her rendition is clearly a tribute to John Lennon. \\"River\\" and \\"Wintersong\\" are truly outstanding, pure Sarah to the core. I especially loved hearing Sarah sing Joni Mitchell, I wouldn't mind an entire album! (Certainly Mitchell has penned enough songs and then some.) It was fun to listen to the somewhat unusual arrangements of the traditional Christmas carols. I only wish that Sarah had taken more than one opportunity to showcase her fabulous upper vocal register since it is so pure and powerful - as anyone who has seen her perform live will attest.<br /><br />Unfortunately this album served to whet my appetite for another studio album from Sarah! The time between albums seems SO long ...
0399226907|3.0|My two year old loves it, but is now calling me and his baby brother \\"big, fat mommy\\" and \\"big, fat baby\\".  It's cute the first few times, then gets a little annoying, and I just hope he doesn't start to generalize.  It seems to be a term of endearment for now.  I've shelved the book until he moves onto newer, and potentially less offensive descriptive words.
B00003CX5P|4.0|this movie actually gets better the more times I see it--I know very surprising.  Jar Jar still stinks--they should of used the Wookies (as in ROTS) instead of his dumb race.   However, the pod race scene and lightsaber duel are two of my favorites from all of the movies.  I still think that this movie had probably the greatest trailer in film history (talk about anticipation build up).   Now that the saga is complete and the pieces fit together you realize Lucas did an excellent job linking to the original trilogy.  Liam and Ewan were both fantastic in this movie.  Natalie was decent and I never cringed at Jake Lloyd like most.  Threepio to me is the most annoying thing about the prequels and one where Lucas tried (and failed) to up the humor factor.  If he had just left the droid humor subtle like in the OT it would have been better (nowhere was this more apparent then the factory scene in Clones--ugh!!).  Oh well as a true fan of the universe I think one was a good start to a great story.  Don't worry haters, in 30 years when Lucasfilm needs more money and the big GL is dead, they will authorize remakes!
031286504X|5.0|Being such an avid reader of \\"horror\\" and \\"suspense\\" stories I am pretty much open to reading anything that falls within the abovementioned categories. However, I usually distance myself from stories about, or centering around, vampires. Why? Well, it seems that more often than not vampire novels are usually cheesy, gothic melodramas that turn the character of the vampire from something sinister into something romantic. I'm not sure if they're all like that but in my experience that seems to be the case.<br /><br />  However with \\"I Am Legend\\", Richard Matheson managed to take the formula of the vampire story and turn it into something different and enjoyable. The story centers around Robert Neville, the LAST man on an earth that is overrun by vampires. Now I don't know about you but the very idea of being the last human being on earth is a terrifying thought in and of itself. I think what I like most about \\"I Am Legend\\" is that it centers less on a guy killing vampires and more on a guy doing the best he can to live from day to day. Isolation, depression, happiness, desire and pretty much every other emotion that a human being can experience is touched upon in this book. You don't have to be a die hard horror fan to enjoy \\"I Am Legend\\", just someone who appreciates a great story.
0465092756|4.0|Peter Woit, in \\"Not Even Wrong\\", voices a suspicion that the \\"String Theory\\" of matter and energy might be a little too popular for the good of physics. Woit, a mathematics lecturer at Columbia University, shows that string theory is so pliable that it can be made to fit any data. This is quite contrary to the usual rules of science, in which the validity of a theory is assessed by testing unique predictions of that theory. Yet despite this lack of testability, String Theory commands the greatest attention in particle physics today (and the greatest amount of grants, staff appointments, etc.) <br />The level of the book should be noted. Since the mathematics involved is well over the head of the lay reader, one has to trust Woit's descriptions of what various mathematical techniques do, and how they relate to physical theories. As Woit details in his chapter \\"The Bogdanov Affair\\", the ideas are sometimes so arcane that even experts can't tell what might be valid research, and what might simply be a hoax. Woit does his best to help the reader, however, by including juicy biographical details of physicists' lives, great quotes in the chapter headings, and good lists of both technical and popular references for the concepts in each chapter.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Rian Johnson's critically acclaimed \\"Brick\\" on a shoestring budget of less than $500,000 surprisingly delivers considerable bang for the buck.  Filmed entirely in California it chronicles a series of episodes taking place with a high school setting spawned by drug abuse and violence.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Brendan Frye a fairly together guy with enough street smarts to know the whys and wherefores of the hip upper crust druggie clique.  When he receives a desperate communication from ex-girlfriend Emily played by Emilie de Ravin he is motivated to act.  Still having deep feelings for her, he meets with the strung out looking Emily who tells him to mind his business.  When Emily turns up dead, Levitt recruits the expertise of his buddy \\"The Brain\\" played by coke bottle bespectacled Matt O'Leary.<br /><br />Levitt slickly immerses himself within the world of local drug kingpin known as The Pin played by Lukas Haas.  Together with his enforcer Tugger played by Noah Fleiss, they rule the roost of this high school subculture.  Levitt slyly strives to learn the details of Emily's demise.
B000777J2S|5.0|Aside from having one of the better names we'd heard for a band, this was listed as the best album of 2005 by one of those cool, British, music magazines that we occasionally purchase to get the accompanying cd sampler. So we were intrigued enough to purchase it. Although it is a mite too peculiar for us to deem it Album of the Year, it is a fascinating and, at times, stirring and beautiful piece of work. Thematically too idiosyncratic and out of the mainstream, one would think, to achieve mass popularity in Britain and most certainly the U.S., these songs most assuredly will not be playing at a NASCAR track near you. Antony, the composer, producer, and lead vocalist sings about issues of gender, sex, love and loss in a style so emotionally naked and intense that if the material is not, in some way, autobiographical, he should win an Oscar along with a Grammy. Talk about emo: \\"My lady story is one of annhilation, my lady story is one of amputation\\"; \\"One day I'll grow up, I'll be a beautiful woman. One day I'll grow up, I'll be a beautiful girl. But for today I am a child. For today I am a boy\\"; \\"You are my sister, we were born so innocent, so full of need\\", Antony sings in a gorgeous warble somewhere between Nina Simone and Tiny Tim, the last line to forefather Boy George in a moving performance by both. Other spiritual, dare we carefully say, `homeys', join Antony, as well, including Lou Reed, Rufus Wainwright, and Devandra Bandhart (who makes Antony sound like Johnny Cash). Not only is the material provocative, engrossing and eloquent, the music itself is exquisite. The centerpiece of the album is the mighty `Fistful of Love' (innuendo seems to infiltrate the entire cd, not to mention this review). We don't know, were he alive today, whether or not Otis Redding would be secure enough in his manhood to sing, \\"I feel your fist. I know it's out of love. I feel the whip. I know it's out of love\\", but, with a Memphis-like horn crescendo driving Antony's performance, the song is, in fact, as soulful as anything Otis ever did. Scout's honor.
0316010669|5.0|This is the type of book that you will want to re-read over and over again because it is well-written, entertaining, and insightful.  The premise of the book is that we can know something without really knowing it.  Gladwell uses a number of unique examples (such as the Getty's near $10 million dollar blunder on an artificial Classic statue, and how improvisational comedy works) to show how we can surmise certain things in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />Gladwell's proof is anecdotal for the most part (which makes [[ASIN:0805078533 On Intelligence]] and [[ASIN:1400077427 Stumbling on Happiness]] great companions to this work), but the author gives us a great look into an almost sixth-sense we humans have though we may not be completely aware of it.  He goes on to describe intense scenes where blink-thinking (meta-cognition) wasn't used properly (crime scene botching and in the Cola Wars) and a number of other entertaining stories.<br /><br />This work and another of his ([[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]]) have been very influential in recent popular books including [[ASIN:1400064287 Made to Stick]] and my own personal finance book.
B000DN6ZGC|4.0|A very talented soul singer from Great Britain, Corinne Bailey Rae has created one of the finest debut cds since, dare we say, those juggernauts of a few years back by Norah Jones and Alicia Keys. A dazzling array of songs, all original, all self- or co-penned, this album may do just what those of Misses Jones and Keys did--appeal to a broad spectrum of listeners and, in the process, win a bundle of Grammys. Ms. Rae exhibits an `old school' sensibility with more than a hint of `new school' rhythms and styles. Rae's delivery is natural and seductive--no need for Aguileral (for those of you who approved our words \\"Esquivelish\\" & \\"Orbisonic\\") acrobatics or histrionics. Like a modern day Billie Holiday, Rae slurs and garbles her straight-forward, matter-of-fact lyrics, making them ever more evocative and gripping. And Rae possesses a feel for making pop music. There are enough hooks on this record to catch a school of guppies (or, perhaps, yuppies). Her song, \\"Put Your Records On\\", would seem the kind of sure-fire hit that assertively trumpets a star in the making.

0780020693|4.0|I have been a strong admirer of Fellini's films and my recent purcase of 'Amacord\\" did not let me down. Set in the 1930's, this film featuring provincial Italy during this period, is full of droll scenes, some of them very funny indeed. Typical of Fellini, this film is a mosaic of fantasy and reality. Italy was in the pre war era of Mussolini and Fellini takes digs of the fascist regime including a hilarious scene featuring a parade. To balance this, there is a brief scene featuring the sinister side of fascism. From a biography written by Tullio Kezich ( a worthwhile read for Fellini admirers) I found that the tiltle comes from 'm'acord', the dialect of Rimini for \\"I remember'. Rimini is ellini's birthplace and \\"Amacord\\" is full of memories of his youth there, presented in his unique style. In 1975, this film won an Osca for best foreign language film. For followers of this genre, I highly recomend \\"Amacord\\".
B000I5X81A|4.0|This record is the one Clapton spent most of the seventies  trying (and failing) to make.  Perhaps the difference is the presence of JJ Cale as co-artist and producer as well as primary writer.  The songs are uniformly good, the playing is excellent, and the record has just the right combination of being laid back and tight at the same time.  It also features a Clapton collaboration with John Mayer that is surprisingly good. The backing musicians (especially Derek Trucks) are outstanding and the artists seem to be very present in the project (not mailing it in).<br /><br />The record opens with Danger, which is a surprising choice as it's one of the weaker songs on the record.  Heads in Georgia, Missing Person and When This War is Over give the record an easy bluesy feel and Sporting Life Blues is a classic that will fit well into the sit down set of the live show.  Hard to Thrill is a really good song that feels a little out of place here and Anyway the Wind Blows is a really breezy uptempo song.  The record finishes stongly with Last Will and Testament and Ride the River.<br /><br />The problem iwth this record is that it is a good , possibly excellent record.  With the artists, background musicians and yes the success of the current touring band, for the first time in a long time I was expecting transcendence from a Clapton record.  While it fails to acheive transcendence it is an excellent record that I highly recommend
0786838655|5.0|If you like Harry Potter, you will probably like this book, too.  Come to think of it, if you do not like HP, you may still like this book.  Recommended reading ages are grades 5-9 but if you're younger and like to read this book may very well be fine . . . and, this book is actually written well enough for adults to enjoy as well. <br /> <br />Tale focuses on a 12 year old boy named Percy who isn't getting along with just about everyone in school and soon discovers part of his problems are related to the fact that he's the son of the Greek God, Poseidon, which leads him to a training camp for Half-Bloods/Demigods and then a quest to stop the Zeus and Poseidon from tearing the whole world apart. <br /> <br />PROS <br /> <br />(1)Told in first person narrative and therefore flows particularly well.; <br />(2) Hip and cutting edge enough, focusing on popular, trendy spots like Las Vegas, at one point, for instance.; <br />(3) Well detailed info on mythology so one could learn a lot without cracking open a mythology book.  A lot of the details are woven into the story rather than just told to you.; <br />(4) Some really funny lines or events; <br />(5) Well established relationship with his mortal mother; <br />(6) Some good action scenes that focus on Greek Mythology; and <br />(7) A few surprised even the veterans of fantasy reading won't spot. <br /> <br />CONS <br /> <br />(1)For adults, if you don't like archetypes and standard story archetypes, you may find this a bit predictable in certain parts. Remember that it's written for young readers.; and <br />(2) Percy tends to fall into a few jams because he doesn't think things through.  He's twelve so I suppose he gets some slack for that but then he also does some smart things so judge it as you will. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000I5X80G|5.0|Yeah, it's short. 6 songs, 43 minutes. <br /> <br />So what? What's here is positively awe inspiring. Young and (lead guitarist) Danny Whitten's interplay sizzles. The versions of \\"Down By The River\\" and \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" are the best I've heard. The sound quality is magnificent. If this was all that could be salvaged from the recordings of these shows, so be it. The artwork even replicates that of an old LP.  <br /> <br />A great package all around, despite the short running time.
B000FQ4M58|2.0|Jim Steinman's abscence in the Producers chair shows. <br />The songs, while full of Meatloafs strong voice, have no emotion behind them. <br />nearly all the songs are covers of previous Steinman productions. <br />the songs are too slow to keep the usual Meatloaf energy rolling over the listener, and as such, rather than feeling the music, you simply sit there hearing meatloaf sing. <br />The duet aspect on Its All Coming Back To Me Now is great, but sadly suffers from the afore-mentioned problems. <br /> <br />I'm terribly dissapointed, and this is the last Meatloaf album i will buy w/o hearing the songs first.

B000FQJAIW|1.0|I rented the \\"original\\" Star Wars first, just to see if it was as bad as everyone says.  Good GOD!  It's horrible!  It looks only slightly better than video tape.  I read a lot of reviews stating that \\"this is what fans have ask for\\"...honestly, I didn't ask for this.  Nobody did.  Sure we all want the choice between the original Star Wars and the Special Edition, but I think George is doing nothing but slapping us fans in the face with this release. I despertly wanted the original movies in their original form, but not like this.  I think George is basically trying to get us to admit that his special edition is better....it's not.  The way it was presented on DVD is far superior, but in my opinion, George is taking away part of our childhood with the new stuff.  for example, they remastered Gone with the Wind and Casablanca, but did they ad new characters?  Change the songs to something more \\"current\\"?  Digitally enhance Atlanta burning? No....but they did do those transfer justice.  They look great, they sound great, and that makes for fun viewing.  This slop that George is handing us is NOT what we asked for....so George, I say to you...NO!  BAD!  If I had a rolled up newspaper, I smack you in the head with it and rub your nose this pile of....DVD's...to make sure you know better next time.  When these films get remastered again for HI-DEF, I'll buy...IF he gives us what WE want.
B00005JPC7|4.0|thornhill woke up early that Saturday, eager to watch a new film he hoped would prove memorable. His alarm went off, far too early for it had been a hectic week and his mind needed rest, but it reminded him of the possible treasure awaiting. Completing his normal morning chores much more quickly than usual; the feel of the water washing away dirt and beard shavings, the smell of the cat food nauseating him just slightly, the bark of his neighbor's dog as he left his apartment and headed out to the car park were all familiar sights and sounds, just experienced at a slightly accelerated pace.<br /><br />The matinee was early, much earlier than he would normally attend, but because it was at an acceptable local theater, right in the midst of his normal Saturday morning routine, thornhill decided to give it a go. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find the movie was screening on one of the multiplexes smaller screens, not the large screen downstairs. Didn't the film open this weekend? These theaters are small and boxy and not at all to the intrepid movie reviewer's liking. But thornhill made a commitment, planned his day, and there was no turning back.<br /><br />Rushing into the theater, thornhill missed one of the trailers, but managed to catch the remaining nine. Thankfully, because he was a few minutes late, he missed the requisite Sprite, cell phone-that-can-play-your-favorite-songs and new violent video game ads that were now a part of the movie going experience. No wonder so many have given up the theater experience completely to view most of their films at home, on DVD. But thornhill would never give up on theaters, not completely, because a large part of the movie experience is hearing the reactions of your neighbors, heightening your experience and theirs.<br /><br />As the first few frames of \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" rolled, thornhill knew he was in for something special. Despite the shadow of an exterior light on one side of the screen (he would surely have to forsake this particular screen in the future), he began to enjoy the film, its wacky story and off-center characters.<br /><br />As thornhill watched, Will Ferrell's character, Harold Crick, an IRS auditor with a very regimented life, began to take form. As Emma Thompson's dulcet tones narrated, he learned a lot about Harold and his life, how little variation or excitement it held. Both Ferrell and director Marc Forster (\\"Finding Neverland\\", \\"Monster's Ball\\") accomplish the brilliant feat of breathing life into this character. Ferrell's performance is so low key; he is extremely believable as a government employee who works at possibly one of the most mind numbing jobs imaginable. As thornhill watched the performance, he realized Ferrell hit every note perfectly. At lunch, Harold reads calculator catalogs, his apartment is drab and monotonous, he spends the exact same amount of time every day at lunch and on his coffee break, and counts the number of steps from his house to the bus stop.<br /><br />Then, he begins to hear the narration of his life. Initially, he thinks he is going crazy, but soon learns the voice belongs to author Kay Eiffel (Emma Thompson) and through more investigation, realizes he is the subject of her new book. The voice becomes a commonplace occurrence, something he is only mildly annoyed with and then begins to accept.<br /><br />Then one day, while waiting for the bus, Kay mentions Harold must die. Naturally, Harold isn't happy to hear this and tries to find Kay and save his life. During this same time, he meets Ana (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the owner of a bakery. Harold is auditing her and Kay's narration is spot on, he can't help but imagine what Ana would look like in a bathtub. But as he is her auditor, the chance of romance is slim.<br /><br />thornhill watched the movie with glee, very happy with the tone and feel of the film. In the opening moments, and throughout, director Forster shows us what Harold's life is like by giving us aview of what his character sees. As Kay's narration explains, Harold walks the same way from his house to the bus, always running the last few steps to catch the same bus. As she speaks, we see a superimposed map appear before Harold's eyes. When he is brushing his teeth, we see a counter appear, helping him keep track of the number of brushstrokes on every tooth. Throughout the film, various maps, diagrams, etc. appear to help Harold maintain the rigidity of his life.<br /><br />Then he meets Ana and she throws him for a loop. Attracted to her, she initially loathes him because he represents the government and is auditing her. But Harold's life is less sound, as he is experiencing something he has never experienced before. Caused by two factors, his new found love and the narration of his life informing him that he must die. When he hears this, Harold decides to live his life like he has never lived it before.<br /><br />As thornhill watched \\"Fiction\\", the film continued to expand and grow, beyond just the Ferrell and Gyllenhaal characters. Yes, they are both very good and the film would probably be fine with just them, but there is more going on in this film.<br /><br />Thornhill was pleased to see Emma Thompson in a fine role in this film. Her voice proved to be the perfect accompaniment to Harold's life. Then, when we meet Kay Eiffel, we realize she is a real mess. She uses the guise of her writing to investigate ways to commit suicide, but we aren't fooled. First, we watch her standing on a roof top, weaving her hand through the air, contemplating what it would be like to jump off. This reverie is interrupted by the arrival of her new assistant (Queen Latifah), a publisher appointed helper meant to help Eiffel get past her writer's block and stay on target. For many a writer, including thornhill, writer's block is a bad thing and Kay has it bad. She can write, but she can't figure out how to kill Harold Crick and without that, the book will meander, the quality will suffer, so this prevents her from writing. For Eiffel, writer's block makes her even more neurotic and nervous, causing her to chain smoke throughout the day.<br /><br />Harold goes to see a psychologist (Linda Hunt) who insists the voices in his head could be quieted by prescription drugs. But he doesn't want to go that route. Instead, he visits a Professor of Literature Theory, Professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), who insists he can't help either until Harold explains the narrator in his head uses a common phrase. When the professor hears this, he realizes something strange is happening to Harold. The professor treats him like a student pursuing their doctorate and they begin working together.<br /><br />thornhill was very pleased to see Hoffman back in form. Every time we see Professor Hilbert meeting with Harold, he is drinking coffee, or eating. At one point, he buys a cup of coffee from vending machine and as soon as they arrive in his office, the professor pours another cup from a small brew pot. It seems to be his nervous tick, a way to keep his hands occupied. The performance is interesting, quirky and completely at place in this universe.<br /><br />As the film continued, thornhill realized the characters were perfectly matched to their environments, another example of the top notch production team working to create an interesting, wacky landscape for the film. Harold's apartment is dominated by off-white and Spartan, with no decoration. Kay's apartment is sparse, but disorganized, to reflect her life. Ana's bakery is homey, cozy and welcoming even to a man who talks to himself and accepts handouts from the baker. The IRS offices are predominantly white, filled with cubicles and numbers and ready to sap the life out of one and all. At one point, Harold stays with his work buddy, Dave, who dreams of going to Space Camp and is clearly a Star Trek nerd. His apartment is all lozenge shapes and stone, built in the mid 70s. In fact, most of the architecture seems to be from the mid 80s, giving the film a stylized look perfectly complimenting the wacky nature of the story.<br /><br />Throughout the film, thornhill delighted at director Marc Forster's off-beat sensibilities. Shortly after Harold meets Ana, he rides a double length bus to his next appointment and listens as the narrator mentions a fate meeting with Ana, who then boards the bus. This is shortly after they have met, so Ana still loathes the IRS Auditor. She refuses his offer of a seat next to him, and tries to get as far away as possible, but the bus lurches, catching her off guard and she lands in a seat directly facing him. As they make small talk, the bus continues on it's course. Because Harold is sitting in the seat positioned in the accordion webbing connecting the two buses, and the camera remains stationary, looking at Ana, every time the bus turns, Harold moves back and forth. This is a brilliant and slightly wacky way of showing how Harold feels about Ana and his relationship with her. He can't quite decide and keeps going back and forth about it.<br /><br />thornhill left the theater very happy but then a thought occurred; many people are probably expecting \\"Fiction\\" to be a raucous, laugh a minute comedy based on Ferrell's previous work. Hopefully, they will be able to look past this and appreciate the film for what it is, a wry, well-made dark comedy with some very funny moments.<br /><br />Very funny moments, indeed.

B0000009SF|5.0|For a microcosm of the contradiction that was Frank Zappa, compare this CD's title with its music.  The title is infantile, deliberately offensive, smutty, and obvious.  The music is sublime, highly intelligent, dense, sophisticated, and thoroughly original.<br /><br />Zappa gave his socio-political-lambasting-musical-theatre-of-the-absurd-dog-and-three-legged-pony-show a well-earned rest and concentrated on doing what he did best, arranging.  In Hot Rats he did this in the rock idiom, in GW the emphasis is on jazz/funk horns and tight orchestration.<br /><br />The title track starts well but outstays its welcome; large sections sound like a duck call repair shop in the midst of its busy season.  From there it gets much better.  For Calvin is inspired, the mildly sinister vocal introduction ushers you into a splendid, multi-layered descent that feels random but is, in fact, precisely controlled - nice.<br /><br />Cletus is hilarious, the maniacally cheerful voices will be familiar to veteran Zappa listeners and can be heard on 200 Motels, Uncle Meat, and elsewhere.  This is Zappa you can hum on the way home.<br /><br />Next comes the pick of the litter, Eat That Question.  George Duke really puts on a jazz/funk clinic, teasing his electric piano mercilessly.  The initial melody, mighty and infectious, bobs and weaves throughout the piece.  Great ensemble playing.  Wow.<br /><br />The closer, Blessed Relief, is probably the prettiest thing Zappa ever recorded - it's a delight to know he was capable of un-ironic beauty.  Music to enjoy in July when you're driving by the sea in a convertible.  This CD is highly recommended.
B000J103X4|5.0|CLASSIC THATS ALL I GOT TO SAY. REAL HIP HOPPERS KNOW WHAT I M TALKING BOUT
B000001F9N|5.0|In March of 1976, Donna Summer released her third album entitled, A LOVE TRILOGY, another album for Donna to further her style in the Disco era. This is an album not to miss, for it is an awesome album that goes deeper into the sound of Disco. <br /> <br />TRY ME, I KNOW WE CAN MAKE IT <br />  The first single from the album. This 18:00 (eighteen minutes) track is nothing short of a classic. This is an awesome tune, and you can really dance away the night with this track. <br /> <br />Intro: PRELUDE TO LOVE <br />  This track is the start of the third track, which is entitled \\"Could It be Magic\\". It only plays out to a minute, six seconds, which is the very start of \\"Could It Be Magic\\". <br /> <br />COULD IT BE MAGIC <br />  The second single from the album. Back in 1973, Barry Manilow had originally written and recorded this track, and it was released as his first-ever single. His original recording of \\"Could It Be Magic\\" is a power ballad that should have been well-received by the public, but for some reason, it wasn't. Donna Summer was the first person (if I'm not mistaken) to record a cover of Barry Manilow's track. Her rendition is this here Disco-enthused version, where after she released it as the second single from this album, it became a huge hit for Donna Summer. Barry Manilow, after hearing Donna Summer's rendition and the response she received from it, wound up taking his recording of the song back into the studio and remixing the music to the track (without touching his vocals), where he then re-released it as a single, where it was better received than the first time round. This is a great cover version and it is one of my all-time favorite songs (both from Barry Manilow and Donna Summer). <br /> <br />WASTED <br />  Great. <br /> <br />COME WITH ME <br />  Awesome. <br /> <br />    Hmm, the second album from Donna Summer to have no more than five or six tracks on it. Kind of odd, but however the case maybe, this album ranks up there with LOVE TO LOVE YOU BABY, and it shows that Donna Summer was well on her way to becoming the Queen of Disco.
0618680004|5.0|What is most telling about the negative reviews below is that none of them actually address any of Dawkins' arguments. Of course they can't. Dawkins is shooting fish in a barrel: but he's still a great shot. <br /> <br />I'm not a huge fan of Dawkins' books on evolution, and the related documentary (Root of all Evil) was more polemical than informative. However The God Delusion is very well-organised and well-written. It clearly and systematically, and hilariously, rips religious belief to logical shreds. It is much more detailed and much more fun than Sam Harris's Letter to a Christian Nation.
B000IU3XTW|4.0|At first, I assumed that like most live albums, Skin and Bones was released merely to keep the cash flowing while in-between albums. However, I am a true Foo fan who has all their albums and I figured I would give Dave and co. the benefit of the doubt. Boy, was I happy that I did. This album has so much emotion and soul in it, making it impossible to label as just another live album. Due to its acoustic nature, the sound is far superior to most live albums and makes you feel like you are there. In addition, the fact that it is acoustic brings new light to classic Foo tunes. I agree that they should have released the entire set (release as 2 discs if necesarry), however the album only falls short in that aspect.  <br />I gave it 4 stars because it is shortened(very noticable for me at least)but still a solid release that will get quite a few spins. <br /> <br />RECOMENDED:for Foo fans. New fans just getting into Foo: go get their studio albums.
B000002LQR|2.0|I remember this album well; you could hardly call it a 'barnstormer', as it was released well before \\"Under The Bridge\\" made them the bandwagon band of the year, but nothing could hide the fact that this was a band hellbent on proving the critics right--they never had a good album.<br /><br />For every song worth listening to (\\"Suck My Kiss\\", \\"Give It Away\\"), there were at least four more songs that should have been discarded.  This album was and remains a perfect example of why bands shouldn't feel obliged to slam 50 minutes of crap onto a slab of aluminum just because they can.<br /><br />On top of that, the vocals were pitched and pro-tooled beyond belief.  Some friends and I got a chance to see the band when they were supporting this album, and Kiedis was so off-key, it wasn't funny.  They drowned their sound in reverb so to try and drown out his lousy vocals, but the damage was done.  People were walking out in droves.
0446530573|5.0|If you're looking for a cookbook on regional Italian cuisine buy Marcella Hazan or Lidia Bastianich instead. If you want haute Italian buy Mario Batali. If you're looking for some authentic east coast Italian-American family home cooking then get this is the book. This is stuff your mom or grandma would make. I bought this as a joke on a whim as a Soprano's memorabilia item and was pleasantly surprised to find it's a good cookbook to boot. The recipes are easy, functional, and tasty. The ingredients are simple to find. One word of advice though, as others have noted, keep a close eye on the cooking temperatures because sometimes they seem a bit off, though the ingredients and proportions are excellent and can be easily tweaked to your taste. Two other books I'd recommend of the same sort are Rao's cookbook and The Wise Guy cookbook. Like the Soprano's cookbook they have yummy home cooking with lots of amusing anecdotes that make the books fun to read.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|This movie has it all.  Love, heartbreak, sex (well done), acting, casting.  A very unusual story line, done very well.  It will remind you at times of some of the Jane Austen stories, and then ....<br /><br />This is a Great evening with your loved one!
B000FIMG68|5.0|AWESOME!  Great companion to the Season 1 set.  I only wished this was released in the beginning of the summer instead of the end.  Lots of cool extra features on the DVDs.  I would definitely recommend this to any fan of the series!

I'm really getting tired of certain studios setting up for the \\"double dip\\" by not including the basic extras from their dvd couterparts.

B000J103X4|5.0|This album Doctor's Advocate is the Bomb. I liked The Documentary but this album is something you should have if your a fan of Game. Most of the songs in this album have slow beats but the lyrics are great and they don't sound boring like some of the songs in Documentary. The best thing is he did this album without a single help from Anyone!!!!(Signed with new Label) His songs also gotta a new style, more better with people like Nas, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg in them. His songs with 50 Cent were all the same style.  <br /> <br />The Game is back with a Brand New Style <br /> <br />Its Something U Gotta Have!! <br /> <br />My Top 5: <br />1. One Blood <br />2.

1843104954|5.0|As a parent of a 9 year-old Asperger's child and a 7 year-old PDD-NOS child, I can say I have read a multitude of books and articles on Asperger's and autism.  This book is by far the best, comprehensive book I have ever read regarding the subject.   <br /> <br />It is easy to read, yet comprehensive, including strategies for parents and educators alike.  I was particularly impressed with the chapter explaining \\"Theory of Mind\\".  For those that don't understand the nature of Asperger's and High Functioning Autism, this chapter is very succinct in explaining how the brain of an Asperger's child or adult operates.    I immediately copied this chapter (is that allowed??) for my son's new teacher and begged the principal to order a copy for the school!! <br /> <br />Thank you Tony Attwood for writing such a tremendous book that will certainly go a long way to shed light on Asperger's for educators and caretakers alike!! <br />

B000F1IQN2|4.0|Having lived through the coverage of the slaughtered Israeli athletes during the 1972 Olympics, I felt like I was experiencing the actual events as they were occurring over again.  Speilberg did an excellent job using stock news footage from the tragedy and overlaying actors into recreated scenes.  Though these events are actually shown piecemeal throughout the film, the actual story is about what transpired afterwards.  The Israeli government hired a hit squad to track down and eliminate 11 individuals that participated in the planning of the terrorist action at the Olympics. <br /> <br />This is based on an actual operation that the Mossaud carried out but obviously is Speilberg's fictionalized version of how it was done. <br /> <br />Eric Bana is a German/Jewish Israeli Mossaud operative who is chosen to lead the group of 5 mercenaries as they hunt down the perpetrators throughout Europe.  It is interesting how this Australian actor is able to change his accent at will to fit the roles that he is playing.   <br /> <br />Bana is torn to do the mission because his wife is expecting the birth of their first child and the secret mission means that he must risk his life and possibly not see his wife till the mission is complete which could take years.   <br /> <br />As the movie goes along Bana's personality starts to change from a gung-ho good government employee to someone who questions what he is doing and is constantly looking under his bed and phone for hidden bombs. <br /> <br />The movie moves along at a fast pace and you keep thinking you are seeing real events as they happen.  Sometimes it is a little complicated to understand what is going on (that is the value of having the DVD to be able to understand what you may have missed the first time). <br /> <br />Look for the actor who plays the new Bond in the main supporting role.  There is also an interesting sequence shot on the Queens side of New York City (supposedly taking place in 1973) where I was lookingto see buildings that did not exist at the time and you do see the World Trade Center (I am assuming the scene was shot after 2001).

B000I5X81K|3.0|This album is probably  good for what it was intended but it is not what I expected.  I listened to the DVD first and was excited to hear the CD but found that in most of the selections, Josh sounded like a background singer to the instrumental.  It is not bad but his voice is so beautiful in classical sounds and this is a \\"pop\\" sounding album.  Only a couple of songs touch on his pure sound.  I have listened to it several times to see if I was missing something but what is missing is Josh.  If the goal was to portray a differnt side of his voice, it did that.    I was dissappointed that it was not what I expected and I don't believe it did much to show the depth of his wonderful talent. It did a great deal to show diversity and imagination but  I believe many pop singers could have done this album  while  no one could have done his other two  albums except Josh.  It is not bad it just does not show off the quality of his voice and the depth of feeling I enjoyed in his first two albums which I play all the time.  This will not be one that I play over and over.  Maida
B000B8IA2G|5.0|The first season of Stargate Atlantis is definitely just as good as the best seasons of SG-1. Only a couple of episodes feel borrowed from SG-1, other than that, this series truly is incredible. Almost every single episode is action packed and full of adventure. The new characters haven't had the years to grow like the SG-1 cast has, but they have amazing potential in the years to come to be just as good as SG-1. They are already on the right track with this season. They have a good list of guest appearances from SG-1 cast members and Hollywood stars. If you are a fan of Stargate, you definitely owe it to yourself to buy this DVD set as well.
0440237688|5.0|Jonas, the main character of The Giver, lives in a strange, \\"utopian\\" community of the future. Here, no one makes their own decisions - the Committee of Elders chooses everything from jobs to family members for the people, and the rule book sets forth how all of the people must live their lives. Everything in the community is clean, organized, orderly, safe, and well-planned. There is no crime, no poverty, no competition, and no rudeness. However, this perfect existence comes at a cost. Lois Lowry has written an interesting, exciting, and thought-provoking novel. Although it is categorized in the science fiction genre, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a suspenseful story. <br /> <br /> When the story opens, Jonas is a careful, compliant young man, who is anxiously awaiting the Ceremony of Twelve, at which he will receive his Assignment - the career which will be chosen for him by the Committee of Elders. He lives in a dwelling with the other members of his family unit (a mother, a father, and a younger sister). They have been selected and assigned to each other by the Committee of Elders. <br /> <br /> Life in this community is very structured. Sameness and Climate Control ensure that each day is well-planned and that there are no surprises. People, including children, who do not fit in are released and sent Elsewhere. Trained Nurturers are responsible for the care and nurturing of the newchildren for the first year of their lives. Trained personnel of the community also care for the elderly members of the community. When their usefulness to the community is over, they, too, are also released and sent Elsewhere. <br /> <br /> At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is selected for a great honor - he is to be the new Receiver of Memory for the community. He will be trained by the current Receiver, who tells Jonas to call him The Giver. As part of the training, The Giver will transfer to Jonas all of the memories he is now bearing for the whole community. \\"Memoriesare forever,\\" The Giver tells Jonas. The Committee of Elders will occasionally seek the advice of The Receiver. He must rely on the memories and experiences to guide the Elders when unexpected things happen in the community.  <br /> <br /> As the new Receiver-in-training, Jonas learns about many things that existed before Sameness and Climate Control. He learns about many feelings, which only The Giver has experienced. He learns of war and hunger - things which are also unknown to the community. <br /> <br /> It does not take Jonas a long time to he realize that his life will never be ordinary again. He realizes that the great honor he has received is also a great burden. The memories and new experiences cause him to feel frustrated and angry at times with his friends and family. He is upset that they are satisfied with their programmed lives. Jonas tries to make them understand some of the things he has experienced, but he is unsuccessful. Without the memories, they cannot understand. The Giver tells Jonas, \\"The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.\\" <br /> <br /> After almost a year of training, Jonas and The Giver develop a plan to return the memories to the community. In order for the plan to succeed, Jonas will need all of the memories of strength and courage that the Giver can transfer to him. However, something that Jonas never expected happens which affects Gabriel, a newchild who has been living with Jonas' family unit for the past year. Jonas is forced to alter the plan and improvise a new, much riskier one, without The Giver's help. <br /> <br /> Read The Giver, and you, too, can discover the price that Jonas' community paid to live in a \\"perfect\\" world, and whether it was worth it. Then, decide for yourself what you would be willing to give up to live in a \\"perfect\\" world.
B00006RU5B|4.0|One of the few supergroups to ever be worth the hype Audioslave had it all to prove, and I give them extra respect for the fact that they bore up as well as could be expected to the pressure. Because this is better music than could reasonably be expected from a combination of Soundgardens vocalist and RATM's band.<br /><br />First on the plus side is no silly left wing platitudes in the lyrics. So we're past the first hurdle in the bands path. Secondly the music. Rather than the limited stop/start rap rock style of RATM the boys have come up with a fine slice of American rifferama. So that's the second hurdle leaped. And my third concern was whether Cornell would ruin the album by insisting on holding notes for forever and a day? Well he doesn't, creating verses that sound like proper verses not weird tantric lung exercises. And the man is in fine voice here, all power drenched and restrained at the same time only unleashing his full roar when it most suits proceedings (I think they call it - gasp - maturity).<br /><br />And the songs really come up well under a full bodied production job by Rick Rubin. All of which means  that this album - and let's just call it classic rock and be done with it - has few down sides. Of course there are a few and by they mainly centre around the later songs as fourteen tracks is about three too many. But it's sort of affirming that such seasoned professionals could make the same mistake as many other bands in the CD age. But that should not cloud the fact that this album set the ball rolling and gave the band a healthy base for future releases.
B000IU3Y3W|5.0|Man..I cannot believe I got THIS excited about a cd that was recorded over 36 years ago.This is the debut release from the famed Neil Young<br />Performance Series Archives and it is no disappointment. This is Crazy<br />Horse recorded live in their first(& greatest)incarnation.Like ragged<br />Highlanders sweeping down from the Scottish hills,the late,great Danny<br />Whitten & Jack Nitzsche add their slash and stab to Neil's staccato<br />lead guitar in a sonic blend that Led Zep would be proud to call their own.Ralph Molina & Billy Talbot fill out the legendary Crazy Horse rhythm<br />section.This recording was mixed for cd about ten years ago but I guess Neil was still figuring out what format he wanted to present his over due Archives. This is as fine a way to start as any.The sound<br />is superb;especially in the hi-res dvd format.There are only six songs<br />on this recording & I've read some criticism about that.I think the fact<br />that this recording is available in any form is a cause for celebration.<br />For all the fans that see Neil Young as an aging icon of a bygone era,<br />much like Sinatra in his later years,this recording finds him & his bunch playing the music of their young souls.Neil Young once said rock &<br /> roll WAS music for the young soul. He wasn't talking about age;this<br />cd shows what he had THEN & what he continues to have NOW.Amen.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.<br /><br />This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.<br /><br />This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.<br /><br />Token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover?<br /><br />Wow - checking my reviews a couple of months later and this has been hammered. So I re-read the thing and hang about - I've said almost totally positive things. Guess this review just got run over by a locust like swarm of Audioslave devotees who couldn't bear their heroes not getting five stars! But hey I was like that once too.....when I was 15...hen I was 15...
B000J10ERO|5.0|Look, up in the sky!  It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's... well you know the rest.  As most people have no doubt heard, this year was the year that the hero who sets the standard for other heroes, the man known as 'The Last Son of Krypton', returned to theaters after an almost 20 year absence.  After allowing the franchise to die at the hands of \\"Superman 4: The Quest For Peace\\" (a movie that has long been rumored to have suffered due to too much studio tampering), Warner Brothers decided the moment was finally right to bring the Man of Steel back from his Hollywood grave.  For almost a decade the WB tried very hard to get a new Superman movie off the ground, using various writers, directors, and actors, ranging from Tim Burton and Brett Ratner as directors to Nicolas Cage and Brendan Fraser as stars, and even Kevin Smith as a writer at one point.  Finally, Warner Brothers enticed director Bryan Singer (director of \\"X-Men\\" and \\"X2: X-Men United\\") to leave the series he started at Fox only months before preparing to work on the final chapter in his 'X-Men' trilogy, and join them on bringing Superman back to the big screen in a way befitting the greatest superhero of all time.    \\"Superman Returns\\" begins with a recently parolled Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) swindling a rich, old woman out of her fortune just before she dies, in hopes of using her money and resources to accomplish his greatest scheme ever, to use Kryptonian technology to take over the world, reshaping it any way he pleases.  How does Lex plan on succeeding with his mission of world domination with Superman being able to stop him.  Well, Superman (Brandon Routh) has been on a self-imposed exile to discover if Krypton may still exist somewhere in space, but after 5 years of searching he finally returns to Earth with the knowledge that he is indeed the last surviving member of the long dead planet.  However, upon Superman's return to Earth, he finds that his adopted planet has moved on, and figured out howto survive without him, including Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth).  Now Superman must come to grips with the fact that the people he cared about have moved on, and hope that he can be welcomed back into their lives as both Clark Kent and Superman.  Of course, if he is to be accepted on Earth again, there has to be an Earth to live on, so now Superman must find a way to stop Lex and advanced technology from his own world, before all hope is lost.    After a nearly 20 year absence from the movie screen, was Bryan Singer's epic adventure worth the wait?  In a word, absolutely!  Bryan Singer and his writers Mike Daugherty and Dan Harris (writers of \\"X2: X-Men United\\") have brilliantly captured the spirit of Superman and continued on with the stories started in the previous 4 movies.  Although, if viewed in the proper context as intended by Singer, \\"Superman Returns\\" actually falls after \\"Superman 2\\", which is why many references are made to events from the first 2 movies via Jor-El (using Marlon Brando footage shot for \\"Superman\\" and \\"Superman 2\\") voiceovers.  In my opinion you can view this new installment after the fourth film that way you can fully enjoy the entire 'Superman' saga as originally intended.  The casting for \\"Superman Returns\\" is excellent all across the board.  Relative newcomer Brandon Routh does an excellent job of bringing Superman/Clark Kent to life, evoking the many emotions our hero goes through as he tries to redefine his place in our world.  The supporting actors each make their characters their own by taking what had previously been done with the characters throughout all their different incarnations and tweaking them for the modern day.  Kevin Spacey truly shines as Lex Luthor, though I enjoyed Gene Hackman's Lex, I feel that Kevin did a much better job of bringing the evil and duplicitous nature of Lex to life, while still holding on to some of his dark wit.  Kevin's wit actually resembles Michael Rosenbaum's portrayal on the hit TV show, \\"Smallville\\".  Kate Bosworth is perfect as Lois Lane, providing a much better interpretation of the character than Margot Kidder did in the Christopher Reeve movies, plus Kate is much easier on the eyes than Kidder ever was.  The rest of the cast with lesser parts were equally impressive from James Marsden's portrayal of Richard White, to Sam Huntington's Jimmy Olsen, and Frank Langella as Perry White, every actor truly shines in this movie.  The special effects for this movie are truly top-notch, the scenes with Superman flying are so incredible and awe-inspiring that you truly, honestly believe that you are actually witnessing a man flying.  The excellence that this movie achieves is so vast, that I truly could go on and on about what I think of this film, but I'll spare you having to sit here reading that, so bear with me for just one more moment as I sum up this movie.      \\"Superman Returns\\" brings the Man of Steel back to life in such a magnificent way that you leave the theater wishing there were truly heroes like him in this world and wanting to see more of Earth's greatest protector in action.  If you haven't seen this movie, then I strongly recommend that you rush out and rent it the moment it hits DVD shelves.  Before viewing this movie you may want to give yourself a refresher course on what has occurred in the previous 4 movies, or at least the first 2.  So, with all that being said, sit back, relax, and remember what it's like to believe that a man can fly.    \\"Superman Returns\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Despite what many people may say about this movie it is incredibly informative as well as entertaining. Though some people may argue that this is \\"bad science\\" the reality is that in the SCIENTIFIC community they are overwhelmingly in agreement, despite what the mass media may lead you to believe, that global warming is happening, it is man made, and if we do not find a way to keep it in check it will become a huge problem. You and I can debate this all we want to at the end of the day it's the opinion's of the SCIENTISTs that we should be listening to and with the exception of a few who work for the OIL companies they do believe this to be a viable threat. Finally to the guy who feels the need to call Al Gore an extremist perhaps you should at least acknowledge that in world full of politicians whom will do any thing for a buck at least Al Gore is doing what he feels is right and is not a bad man so maybe you should be less hostile.   <br /> <br />p.s. i'm a terrible speller so please excuse any spelling mistakes
0783226063|4.0|This is the 'short' version (2hr 17min) and the only version finally approved by David Lynch.  The extended version (which can be bought here as well) is the one that Lynch disowned, insisting that it be labeled 'directed by Alan Smithee', the name used when a director refuses to put his or her name on a finished film.  In my opinion, however, the extended version is much more complete, and regardless of having been disowned by Lynch, provides a lot more background and insight into the characters in the film, and is almost word for word from the book.  Much more so than this version, which assumes the watcher has read the book and knows the background.  It's just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt, but I recently purchased the other version available here which includes both versions of the film, both David Lynch's and 'Alan Smithee's' films, and it's only 2 dollars more than this one, and comes in a neat collectors tin with nice paperwork inside and a 2-sided DVD. <br /> <br />Rob Hale
B0000033P0|4.0|If Emerson Lake and Palmer were considered by some as major architects of progressive rock with the release of their first album, they easily cemented that impression with their second offering, Tarkus.  There is little to say that hasn't already been said about this iconic album, but in the unlikely case you're discovering ELP for the first time, consider this a mandatory listen for any self-respecting prog rock fan.  That said, there are some noteworthy differences between Tarkus the opus and Tarkus the album.  As a composition, and considering that it is the better half of the album in both quality and quantity, Tarkus is grandiose in both its ambition and delivery.  Largely Keith Emerson's vision, it is also a complex, sinewy juggernaut that at times seems to challenge Greg Lake and Carl Palmer to keep up the pace.  To their credit, no one is left behind and the entire piece would be something significantly less without the contributions of each member and the synergy of these three superb musicians.<br />Tarkus as an album is another matter.  Following the Tarkus suite is a daunting task and the second half of the album illustrates the difficulty as it is noticably weaker than the first half.  They introduce what was to become the obligatory honky-tonk piano piece with Jeremy Bender.  Pleasant enough, but a bit of a let down after the take no prisoners performance of Tarkus.  [...] Crystal makes up for it with high tempo and intensity.  The Only Way and Infinite Space are subdued and a little frustrating in their restraint, more so because they are squeezed between [...] Crystal and the other part two highlight (and equally intense) A Time and a Place.  Are You Ready Eddy? is a complete throwaway and an almost shameful end to the album considering how it begins.  Yet even with its faults, Tarkus holds its place as one of the most influential progressive rock albums ever released.  If they never matched Tarkus as a single work, ELP cranked out at least two morealbums, Trilogy and Brain Salad Surgery, that were almost as strong and by most accounts more listenable as a whole, but Tarkus binds their undisputed standing as progressive rock's first supergroup and well earned it is.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|I was totally skeptical of this album.  Meat Loaf's recorded output has been spotty to say the least, and as a long-time fan, I was disgruntled that he'd put out a \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" record that wasn't 100% pure Jim Steinman.  Steinman invented the Bat concept, and, arguably, the musical & aesthetic idea of \\"Meat Loaf the Rock Star.\\"  So I was prepared to renew my call for Mr. Loaf to hang up his puffy shirts and concentrate on Broadway and film roles in his very talented capacity as \\"Michael Lee Aday the Actor.\\" <br /> <br />Now I happily scarf big, steaming mouthfuls of delicious crow pie.  This record was way better than it has any right to be.  It lacks the unified vision of all Steinman projects, and suffers from some very skippable material (cough*Diane Warren*cough), but what works, works wonderfully.  Writer/Producer Desmond Child has written some very good songs and created a very dark, dense sound that harks back to the glory days of Steinman and Rundgren, but with a satisfying metal crunch.  Indeed, this is the heaviest, most \\"hard rock\\" album of Meat Loaf's career.  Child coaxes a rip-roaring performance from the star, and the supporting players (Steve Vai, Nikki Sixx, Jennifer Hudson, et al) all make the most of their roles.  Meat Loaf's \\"rock voice\\" has rarely sounded better, though his \\"ballad voice\\" is still rather forced and quavery. <br /> <br />Highlights:  The title track and and Desmond Child's \\"Blind As A Bat\\" are especially catchy and pleasing - the latter ballad is a potential classic.  The recycled Steinman songs come off well, with four selections from previous non-Meat Steinman albums as well as three new songs.  Of particular note are the vintage \\"Bad For Good\\" (written for Meat 25 years ago and finally recorded by him), \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\" (a wonderful duet with American Idol diva Jennifer Hudson), and the totally gonzo Metallica-In-Vegas rocker \\"If It Ain't Broke, Break It,\\" which features a ranting, raving vocal performance. The gratuitous cover of \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" was misguided from the outset, but the rest of the album is tasty enough to forgive such mis-steps.   <br /> <br />It can't match the lightning in a bottle genius of the original \\"Bat,\\" but with proper label support, this could be another well-deserved hit for Mr. Loaf.
0553573403|4.0|Lord of the Rings was one of the first real works of literature that I can remember reading (in the sixth grade I believe).  I subsequently reread the LOTR collection six or eight times in the succeeding ten years.  Also during that period, I read Frank Herbert's Dune series (fantasy/science fiction).<br /><br />Since that time, I have read numerous efforts in the fantasy genre and been almost universally disappointed.  Most read like cheap copycats of LOTR and as a result I abandoned the entire fantasy genre for twenty years.  I remained a devoted fan of science fiction, particularly the work of Asimov.  Game of Thrones is the first work of fantasy that I have read in many years and I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Another reviewer noted that much of the allure lies in the fact that the magic contained in the work is quite sparse and of a \\"low magic\\" variety.  Were it not for the goings on \\"North of the Wall\\" and at the very end of the book (having to do with Danyreas), this novel could have been a book about Medieval England in the times of the Arthurian legends.<br /><br />The writing is very good and the story telling is excellent.  If you're looking for a book full of sorcery, elves, dwarves and absurd and unrealistic plot twists, this is not the book for you.  If, on the other hand, you enjoy tales of medieval kings, their knights and struggle for power, with just enough \\"magic\\" to spice up the plot, you will enjoy this book.  I certainly will proceed on to Book Two.
B000002J1M|5.0|What can be said to top the numerous fabulous reviews on this page?   <br /> <br />These guys created unmatchable imaginitive intellectual masterful music during an era of very tough competition.  <br /> <br />34 yrs later, one never tires of the emotional high attained while listening to anything the Real Genesis created - Lamb Lies Down and before.  Foxtrot is an absolute masterpiece.  I remember the days where Rodney Bingenheimer would play Suppers Ready on KROQ 106.7 (in Los Angeles).  that was before the Bean Counters destroyed the music industry.  Imagine a station having the nerve to play a 20 minute song with no commercials today.  Good luck. <br /> <br />Buy this, you absolutely will not be disapointed.  This is Music with a capital M. <br /> <br />
B000J103X4|2.0|if Game had have came out with something different than he would have been better suited. basically he followed a blue-print. this Album&Album cover are basically part 2 of his Debut. His tiresome name-dropping gets old real fast. word to Game, lose that element in your rapping or your next album will suffer from that. beats&Productions are cool on here,but the Lyrical flow&overall direction of this Album don't really move me. \\"it's Okay is a cool track. but if Game wants to be the New Era Version of the West Coast then he has to get tighter with his Game.  Too Short,Ice Cube,DJ Quik,Dr.Dre,Snoop,etc... West Coast Legends,Game ain't nowhere near that point. Game can mimick&Name Drop Dr.Dre all he wants but he has to learn to craft a Song&knock it out under his Own Vision. that is what Seperates Contenders from Pretenders.
B0002V7O3S|4.0|I was roughly 9 or 10 when the film came out and quite frankly, it scared the hell out of me. Revisiting it several times since then, it's one of those kind of films where it holds up, even though my critical eye became keener. Back then, I wouldn't have cared about pacing or character development or anything: if it was good, then it was good. Does the film still entertain and at times, terrify? Sure, but maybe not as much as it used to. For new viewers though, you'd probably like it. <br /> <br />Based on the controversial real-life story, a group of loggers see their friend, Travis Walton, encounter a UFO and find him missing. The story centers around the search for his body since everyone believes the loggers killed him and getting the full brunt of their cries is Mike Rogers, Travis' best friend. Travis is later found bloodied and bruised and seriously disturbed.  <br /> <br />Looking up the actual story on the net, you find evidence that it was either all a big hoax or X-Files-like cover up. Watching the film though, you tend to believe it and wonder whether it really happened or if it was something else. Luckily the film doesn't say one way or the other that it really did or not. You have scenes that strongly suggest it did while you have everyone saying it was all a big lie but it's ultimately up to you whether you want to believe it but it sure makes you want to believe it.  <br /> <br />The acting mainly falls on the shoulders of Robert Patrick and D.B Sweeney as Mike and Travis. Largely known as T-1000 from Terminator 2, it's surprising by just how effective Patrick can be. And although absent for a good chunk of the film, D.B certainly makes an impression in his limited screen time. The rest of the actors are admirable in their roles but they don't really require much else to do which is fine. Craig Sheffer plays the attitude man, Allan Dallis while James Garner plays the investigator sent to solve the case. He essentially plays the one emotion: that he'sright, no such thing as UFO's and even when Travis returns and tells the story, it's like \\"he's lying too!\\" While that's what he's supposed to play, he does come off as irritating as if himself getting abducted would warrant a disbelieving emotion. <br /> <br />The film arguably succeeds in its beginning and ending: a little bit into the film we get a dramatized account of Travis getting abducted and it's every bit as unsettling as it should be, letting sound design take over and creep in. But definately the highlight, not only in this film but probably in sci-fi films, is Travis' experience on the mothership. Sure the idea might sound hokey: Travis on a ship flying around with aliens inside but it's creepy, unsettling and it's one of the more effective scenes I've seen. It's also ironic that what starts the scene is some kind of syrup which I find funny looking back but the scene works so you kind of forget it all started with Aunt Jemima. <br /> <br />If there's a DVD that needs special features it's this one. This is literally first generation DVD stuff with not even a theatrical trailer or anything. Commentaries, behind the scenes, documentaries, featurettes: zip. But I'm assuming it's going to be similar to Deep Impact's special edition: one commentary and about 5 featurettes lasting 10 minutes and that's it. Too bad cause as flawed as some parts, this is one of my favorite films from the 90's.
B000002HIK|4.0|This may not be Aphex Twin's best album, but it is probably his most complete, incorporating virtually every facet of Richard D. James' musical personality.  This is guaranteed to be some of the most unique, haunting and intriguing work you will ever hear.    It begins with Acrid Avid Jam Shred, probably the most straightforward piece on the album, beginning with halting percussion and slowly building into a strangely majestic yet playful jam, only to fall back onto the driving percussion and U-turn in a completely different direction.  Then the listener is dropped into the squelchy, rubbery bass of The Waxen Pith, which sounds like the inside of a honeycomb or a plant's stem.  It's a tad tedious, but certainly has an interesting blend of instruments.  Wax The Nip feels like a precursor to some of Aphex's harder IDM to come, with rushing drums underscoring childlike wonderment embodied in joyous, choral synths.  It sounds like skydiving over waterfalls, then landing on your feet and running through green fields.    Icct Hedral (Edit) is a journey into the heart of an ancient temple housing some item of unspeakable evil, while all the while something is clawing further and further into your brain.  Headphones are a must.  Ventolin is near impossible to listen to, it's so painful - you get the feeling that Aphex is having a bit of a larf at our expense, since the song behind the shrill, obnoxious high frequencies is really cool.  Come on you Slags! is no balm on the ears either, with chaotic screechy synths blaring over an obnoxious valley girl conversation which fades in and out of coherence.  Yet no matter how difficult these three are to listen to, their genius is undeniable.    Start As You Mean To Go On is one of the more calming tracks on the album, despite the persistent, pounding, constantly morphing beat.  It sounds like high-speed nostalgia.  Wet Tip Hen Ax is pure weirdness, and reminds me simultaneously of eagles soaring over cliffs and alien invasions.  Mookid is one of the most soothing Aphex songs, and reminds me of the quieter moments of childhood, with that signature hint of weirdness RDJ always brings to the table.  Alberto Balsalm is a walk down the block, accented by a sound like someone rattling a stick against the iron bars of a fence.  Ambient synths and calm melodies begin to fill the atmosphere.  Then the track abruptly drops down a well to land in a basement full of clanging percussion, only to climb back out and reemerge in daylight.    Cow Cud is a Twin begins with a very distracting sample of a door slamming and background yelling which is calculated to throw the listener off guard.  The rest of the track is a slow-paced jam with a hooky bassline and intriguing sound effects.  Finally, there's Next Heap With, a fully-orchestral piece that combines the feelings you could get from several tracks on the album, including but not limited to Icct Hedral, Wet Tip Hen Ax and Acrid Avid Jam Shred.  A fitting summation of the musical ideas RDJ has been exploring throughout.    It says a lot that the only way to communicate my feelings about this album is to explore it track by track.  Richard D. James is truly special, in that he makes music that is indescribable, yet completely emotionally resonant.  An artist you must hear before you die.
B00006I53S|4.0|First off this is a very nice lens for the money. I have had mine now for about three months and love it. It is a great walk around lens the 28-135 is just right for most pictures of kids and landscape pictures. It has a fast focus and sharp clear pictures clear up to the 125 range gets a little soft at 135 but easily fixed with a little post editing. I have taken most of my pictures hand held and the IS works great. I even recommended it to a friend. I am using it on the 30D and it spends most of its time there. I am not sorry I purchased this lens and will be taking a lot more pictures with it in the future.

0739340131|2.0|[the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.    I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.    But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get \\"in character\\". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.    (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).    I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book.
068987474X|1.0|If there is one word to sum up this book it's overrated. <br /> <br />Honestly, I don't own this but my sister does. I was frustrated with some dating foibles a few years back when she hoisted 165 pages of pure unabridged crapfest into my direction. <br /> <br />It's almost insulting, yet is so poorly written that it's comical, amusing, and entertaining. Plus it's a fast read, sort of a \\"wham, bam, thank you for wasting the last 2 hours of my life\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps it serves as a reminder to those girls that are not dismissive of guys that just don't call? Maybe so, and in that, it's a noble endeavor.  <br /> <br />Quit obsessing over lame-o's, girls and maybe you can spend the $15 on something more worthwhile than this book, like martinis.
B000J103X4|5.0|First let me say, FINALLY a real rap album for 2006. On the \\"Doctor's Advocate,\\" The Game stays true to his West Coast roots. This album is for the true rap purists out there that can actually remember Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic.\\" I've always loved West-Coast rappers. They've always seemed so passionate about their craft. L.A. has to both the grittiest and seductive background for Rap music and The Game doesn't disappoint. Despite the absence of Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, the album doesn't suffer in either content or quality. It soars with vintage Cali-Gangsta-Rap finesse. It's hard not to sympathize with The Game and not take his side on this record. When he got booted out of G-Unit it was baffling. I'm sure many like myself wondered what was going to be the fate of The Game and his Rap career. I'm happy to say that the worry was senseless. The Game proves that he can write his own ticket and then some. The production on this record is outstanding and sometimes The Game is reminiscent of Dr. Dre from his \\"Chronic\\" days. The \\"Doctor's Advocate\\" makes it hard to argue against him not being the \\"heir to the Aftermath dynasty.\\" This album easily outshines much of what we've heard from Rap/Hip-Hop in the past couple of years. It's definitely better than Game's own debut album \\"The Documentary.\\" It's almost hard to pick out my favorite songs because there's not really anything that I would call filler. I just didn't expect The Game to comeback this hard. He did what I think a lot of people thought couldn't be done...make a great album without Dr. Dre. So if you liked \\"The Documentary,\\" then the \\"Doctor's Advocate\\" is a MUST BUY. I'm impressed. The Game and his collaborators did a GREAT job.  <br /> <br />Favorites: Looking At You, It's Okay (One Blood), Compton, Let's Ride, Wouldn't Get Far, One Night, Ol' English, California Vacation, Around The World, Why You Hate The Game
6304500831|5.0|Regardless to what rubbish is usually written about this movie, it is aimed at the younger audience and I can say with much assurance that it is a wonderful movie for my three year old son and my two year old nephews.  I have family that bring their children over and when they watch this movie, they want copies of their own.  I don't think I've ever heard a child complain about the animation or special effects of this movie.  Kids just don't care what adults think about the shows they like, they are interested in the entertainment value of it.  So this movie is wonderful and entertaining with a hint of some life lessons that we could all use.
B000006TZ8|4.0|I have always been a bit bothered by the fact that 1978's All Mod Cons is considered by many to be The Jam's best record.  If nothing else, this misjudgement steals the thunder of their actual best record, 1979's Setting Sons. AMC is simply not consistently impressive enough to qualify for this distinction. Granted, it was the record that sprung the band back to life after the critically and commercially lackluster This Is the Modern World.  Thus, it allowed them to secure a legacy with even greater follow-ups. So while I agree that AMC was the most important album of The Jam's career, it only consistently pretty to really good, and indisputably great in only one case.<br /><br />The trio of songs that open All Mod Cons includes the vitriolic title track, with verses that stumble over themselves as the guitar, bass, and drums stomp along in unison. \\"To Be Someone\\" seamlessly goes from dreams of stardom, to its realization (including guitar-shaped pools and cocaine), to its disappearance, all in the course of 2-1/2 minutes: \\"And the bread I spend is like my fame - its quickly diminished\\". Thankfully, Jam leader Paul Weller doesn't sound the least bit glib until \\"Mr. Clean\\", one of the weakest spots on the record.  It's not that great of a song to begin with, but it is also unjustifiably venomous toward the square community. (Not everyone can be a cool, rich, devil-may-care rock star like you, Paul.)<br /><br />The record picks up slowly but very surely after this. \\"David Watts\\", sung by bassist Bruce Foxton, is too faithful to the original version to be any sort of revelation, but it is enjoyable for the very same reason. It is also a subtle indication that Weller's main influence for the time being would be Ray Davies, not Pete Townshend. Still, the jaunty pop tune \\"It's Too Bad\\" - also a very enjoyable but not revelatory song - sounds like a re-write of The Who's \\"So Sad About Us\\", which The Jam also covered. (The more you get to know The Jam, implicit and explicit homages to The Who abound.  For example, not only did The Jam cover a few Who songs, they also covered songs that The Who themselves covered, like \\"Heat Wave\\" and \\"Batman\\".) Weller also tosses in a few beautiful and affecting acoustic love songs, \\"English Rose\\" - the original name and inspiration for the band that would become The Stone Roses - and \\"Fly\\".  Finally, there is the impassioned manifesto \\"In The Crowd\\", which is part of Weller's live show to this day, the punky \\"Billy Hunt\\", and the Clash-y, staccato \\"A-Bomb in Wardour Street\\".<br /><br />AMC closes with a mini-mini-opera, the frightening hate crime tale \\"Down In the Tube Station at Midnight\\".  This is one of Weller's two or three finest songwriting moments. His conviction is genuine, the music is sparse but rock solid (with Foxton's bass mimicing menacing footsteps), and the lyrical imagery is vivid from start to finish, with brilliant lyrics like \\"They smelt of pubs, and Wormwood Scrubs, and too many right-wing meetings\\". Weller, showing a keen ability to read the news one day and recreate it in song the next, comes so completely into his own on this song that it squashes all claims that he was a Pete Townshend wannabe or a punk poseur, which were baseless to begin with. (But I must say that he sings with such force that his English accent, which is perfect for The Jam's blend of punk/pop/mod-rock, might sound a bit unintelligible to American ears.)<br /><br />The Jam's All Mod Cons had to happen. As evidenced by their subsequent string of top 40 hits, including four #1s, they simply had too much great stuff in them for their career to be stillborn by a sophomore slump. Weller's lyrics on AMC were more trenchant than before, and he, Foxton, and drummer Rick Buckler benefited more than ever from being great players, which was more important to their sound than being great musicians. And even if Weller's songwriting slips in a few spots (eg, \\"Mr. Clean\\", \\"The Place I Love\\"), one should keep in mind thathe was barely 20 years old when the album was being recorded. All Mod Cons was where The Jam became great, but over the next few years, they would become even greater.when the album was being recorded.

B0000007WF|5.0|I am not shure if any of the reviewers here are reffering to this recording... This is not the \\"original\\" recording of In C - this is a performance od Shanghai Film ORchestra, adding another two \\"eastern\\" compositions to the CD.  <br /> <br />This performance is extraordinary, a flowing of soundscapes, real musical streams, In C sounds even more like some ethereal far-eastern music when played by all those chinese instruments and the other two compositions fit together with it perfectly. I think this is a really gorgeous contemporary music.  <br /> <br />
0446528056|5.0|I would have to say this is one of my favorites!! I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and while Message in a Bottle will always be my favorite, this runs a close second along with A Walk to Remember :) <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book, it is certainly a page turner!! I must demand a sequel!!!!
B00005JPBD|5.0|I've seen most of his films; one better than the one before, in a way different in some ways all carrying a deep sense of humanity! We watch drama unfolding to arrive when less expected at the end; always full of hope. It is hard to describe fully what I felt watching VOLVER. To recommend this movie is to say at least; it is so simple yet so complex. The action takes place in the country site of Spain. Penelope Cruz, wife and mother. Very close to her sister, aunt and cousin (I think), a hard working woman that has to put up with a lousy husband. The art that Almodovar uses to carry you through scenes and images it is unique. The dialogue is alive and simple. This movie screams -LIFE in any word and scene. The way of life, long forgotten and ignored is broth for us to enjoy it. I am not going to unveil the subject; if I do that you have nothing left to explore, but I say that is worth watching because so many beautiful scenes from the Spain's country site- so colorful, to the provincial relationships so simple yet so powerful.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|Definitely the best DVD for region one customers. Almost all of the special features are subbed in English, and the transfer and audio are top notch. Should have been spread out on 2 discs, but still an amazing buy for the price. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.
B00005JKC3|5.0|This movie is great 5+ stars !  The only legimate excuse for not liking this movie  is if you don't like sci-fi/comics or dark ideas like the Hulk.   Its the most real & mature superhero/comic book movie yet.  -And I've seen/own them all. No dated rock music and teenage romance here folks. Hulk is not meant to be Spider-man or Superman.  The movie has a dark story and suits the \\"monster\\" aspect of the Hulk character. It takes a while to start/introduce us to the characters,  and once the action starts- it doesn't stop. Cast is perfect and story is enhanced upon further viewings. Nicely adapts and updates the comic origin and main ideas. Movie is very modern and hi-tech.  Material will appear fresh for many years to come I believe.  The Hulk CGI looks great in 95% of the movie. For those who disagree- he is a huge green monster- deal with it.   This is a movie lovers movie ! Very nice to watch, sound, editing and etc.  I hope they don't make the next Hulk movie too kiddy.  Can't beat for the price- BUY NOW !  I have this to say to the bashers out there- because the movie is unique, you will not tolerate its existence?
B000IOM1RI|2.0|What a let down.  Only a couple of the songs are good and the rest is filler.  I expected much better than this from the greatest rock band on earth.  Where the hell is Kage on this album???  D, you really f'd up on this one.  I was going to go see the movie but after this rip-off I'll pass. <br /> <br />I've been jamming the D since the HBO days.  I'm going to have to go back to what the crusty record store owner told the D.  \\"Let the dream die.\\".  Because if this is what passes for the rock then \\"rock and roll is bogus\\".
B00005RYL2|2.0|I liked the theatrical release a great deal, but the original DVD release with the black packaging sucks.  The video is nassty and grainy, the audio isn't well synched with the actors lips and the audio flutters and warbles throughout.  It's too much for me. It's like watching a dubbed Golden Harvest Kung Fu flick on worn VHS.  How could they release this and sell it, if not to make money on the remastered edition?
B000F48CD8|2.0|With all of the hype surrounding the talented Jack White (and some of the other musicians in the Racontuers), you would expect a solid album from this side project......unfortunately, the album does not deliver. <br /> <br />No one song sticks out for me as anything special.....the band just does not seem to have the same stripped-down, raw, bluesy feeling of the Stripes.  Bottom line, this is a side project that will not likely succeed. <br /> <br />N.B. - I saw these guys play live at the 2006 Virgin Fest near Baltimore, MD.....they were disapointing.  However, another band that played Virgin Fest, Wolfmother, got the crowd into it and played a hard, driving, and deep set.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Harkens back to the Classic Maiden Days!. Buy it you won't regret it!
B000I5X81K|2.0|Well, to be honest, the songs of this album, Awake, are really tasteless. Josh undoubtedly has a wonderful voice. His first album has showed his talent in singing. His second album, Closer, is not as good as his first, but still has some interesting songs. Unfortunately, this album, Awake, has a lot of boring songs which simply try to imitate each other and do not fit at all with Josh's powerful and heavenly voice. After listening to this album several times, I couldn't find any reason why I should play this CD again. I sincerely hope that people can write really good songs such as \\"You're Still You\\" and \\"To Where You Are\\" for him in the next album. Please!
B000005ALN|4.0|This is the last album by George Michael that I've really enjoyed.  There's just this tortured, somber ambiance to each song.  Start to finish I love this CD.  I really don't know why.
B00004RF8J|4.0|If you compare it to the off broadway musical play, the Little Shop of Horrors differs in some of its themes, wonderful foreshadowing in the songs, some great musical numbers, and of course the \\"bad\\" ending.  On its own, however, the film is excellent.<br /><br />In the 80s, the movie musical was all but dead, with a few spotty musicals coming along that were anything but spectacular.  Little Shop of Horrors had enough quirkiness and catchy tunes to create a memorable film.  The film attempts to not only be fun, but match the grandeur of the musical.<br /><br />Little Shop of Horrors is also one of the oddest ideas for a musical, turning Roger Corman's campy b-movie into a blend of comedy, horror, music, and a great morality tale.  On celluloid, all of this translated well, complete with memorable casting of Rick Moranis as loveable/loser/nerd Seymour and great support especially from a very great bit from Steve Martin as a demented dentist.<br /><br />It's great in its own right and is a lot of fun, but lacks some of the depth and dark humor of the play.  Notably absent are \\"it's just the gas\\" and the extension of \\"the meek shall inherit.\\"  These songs complicate Seymour's character and foreshadow the end of the play.  Their absence makes Seymour far more reedeemable in the end of the movie, creating a much lighter piece.<br /><br />It's still great, and the DVD is great at explaining the differences.  Frank Oz and co assembled a great collection of extras for this DVD, including an entertaining outake reel, with commentary from Oz.  Notably absent is the legendary alternate ending.  That's not Frank Oz's fault, who intended on its inclusion - blame Little Shop producer David Geffen, who's holding on for that and leaving fans waiting to see it who can't get the OOP version of the DVD.
0767830555|5.0|obviously one of the greatest movies ever, i had not seen it in years. enjoyable and informative extras. still i bought it for the haunting soundtrack, amazing story, and excellent acting...i am very pleased.
0743277708|5.0|We often wonder if animals communicate and this book allows you to put those thoughts into a fantasy reality.  A great adventure story that will make you laugh and cry.
B000005RRP|5.0|This album was one of my favorites when it first came out especially the intro of fireball and the song Fools this is when  Deep Purple in my opinion were at their best before Blackmore quit the band, I allways admired their tight sound one of the best bands that ever existed and the extras songs Man! what a treat!
B000FUF6QS|2.0|This is certainly the worst \\"horror\\" film I've seen. I guess while others see this as being artistic or filled with taboo subject matter, I just see it as a laughably bad movie.<br /><br />The nude dancing sequence made me crack up.<br /><br />The music was so bad it was funny (although it was the 70's)<br /><br />Not much of a plot going on.<br /><br />The police officer's strong religious convictions come off as whiny and tiresome, and I was pretty glad to see his fate at the end.<br /><br />Christopher Lee is the only good point I can think of.<br /><br />All in all, I suppose it was an \\"educational experience\\" for me to see this widely celebrated 70's \\"classic\\". I guess maybe I expect every old horror film to be as good as the Vincent Price classics, so I learned my lesson. I don't see how this movie is good enough to warrant a remake.<br /><br />If you want to be scared this is not the movie for you. This movie is great for a laugh, though.
B000FIMG68|5.0|If you found yourself muttering the title of this review after a dizzying season of flashbacks and new characters, you're not alone. Of course, the person who actually uttered that phrase was one of the ones who made the second season of ABC's hit show a blast to be a part of.<br /><br />And of course, there may be spoilers in the following review.<br /><br />John Locke, the formerly wheel chair-bound, hatch-obsessed, wild man came out with those words after viewing an orientation film inside the hatch that he blew open at the end of season one. The secrets of what's inside the hatch, dangled tantalizingly before viewers as season one ended, are revealed as the second season picks off right where the first left off.<br /><br />Locke (Terry O'Quinn) and former prisoner Kate (the incredibly beautiful despite being covered in mud and dirt all the time Evangeline Lilly) descend into the hatch to find a whole other world, one that they couldn't imagine was there. Doctor Jack (Matthew Fox) soon follows them and finds them in trouble and the season continues from there.<br /><br />The focus of season two was the hatch and just what the meaning of it was. Locke is initially obsessed with his find, but as the season goes on, becomes aware that he may just be part of an experiment and turns his back on the hatch, much to the dismay of one of his fellow castaways.<br /><br />The hatch provides many of the story lines for the season. It allows the castaways to not starve, as there is a huge pantry loaded with food. It provides a shower and an arsenal, though one of the survivors manages to take the guns for himself in a bold power move to upstage Jack and Locke in their struggle for \\"control\\" of the island. The hatch also serves as a prison when the survivors capture a man believed to be one of the \\"others\\" and keep him locked up while they figure out just what to do with him.<br /><br />Season two also finished the story began in season one when Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), Sawyer (Josh Holloway), Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley) headed out to sea on a raft seeking help, only to find a boat with the \\"others.\\" The Others kidnapped Walt and blew up the raft, leaving the survivors in the middle of the ocean. When we pick up the story, Jin is nowhere to be found, while Michael and Sawyer cling to the raft's remains and float among the sharks.<br /><br />This story leads to the story of the Tailies, the group of survivors from the rear end of the plane. They find Jin washed up on the shore, and later Michael and Sawyer walk right into their trap. Thinking that the three survivors are Others, they keep them locked up until they can be convinced otherwise.<br /><br />The Tailies include the former drug runner turned priest Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), psychiatrist Libby (Cynthia Watros), former cop Ana-Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez) who viewers met in one of Jack's flashbacks in season one and Bernard (recurring star Sam Anderson), the husband of Rose, who lives among the other survivors. While the group started as more than 20, the Others captured a number of them, dwindling their numbers. They make the decision to head to the other side of the island to unite with the other survivors.<br /><br />However, the two groups merge and tragedy strikes, as a case of mistaken identity leads to the death of one of the survivors. The addition of the tailies does introduce a number of great new flashbacks, particularly those of Mr. Eko. Ana-Lucia has a couple of flashbacks as well, and Bernard and Rose get their moment in the sun too. While Libby doesn't have a flashback of her own, she plays a huge part in two other flashbacks from other characters, and will in all likelihood be a part of the story somewhere down the road.<br /><br />Along the way, Michael leaves the survivors in search of Walt, and returns a much different man, but still bent on getting his son back. The lengths that he goes to in order for his son to be returned to him are great and personally, what he does came as a complete shock to me when I watched the show on its original run. It was a major twist in the story, one that completely turned the survivors on their heels.<br /><br />Former drug addict Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) and new mother Claire (Emilie deRavin) come to blows in their friendship when she finds heroine stashed away in a Virgin Mary statue and a flashback with Claire brings viewers back to her capture by the Others in season one and how she actually got away from her captors with a little help from a friend.<br /><br />Sayid (Naveen Andrews) mourns the loss of a close friend and as the season draws to a close, he is sailing with Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin as they attempt to help Jack find the Others and their camp. His flashback to the Gulf War reveals a big connection with another survivor and a future flashback makes a big connection with Sayid's time in the Iraqi Republican Guard.<br /><br />Hurley (Jorge Garcia) finds himself in charge of the food, a situation that he doesn't enjoy and we also get a flashback to him just as he won the lottery and another flashback as he spends time in a mental hospital. He also finds love with Tailie Libby.<br /><br />We see how Jack's marriage fell apart and how Locke's relationship also fell apart. Julie Bowen as Jack's wife Sarah, Kevin Tighe as Locke's absentee father and Katey Sagal as Locke's girlfriend Helen, all shine in their flashback roles. We see how Ana-Lucia ended up in Australia and a major connection she has to one of the other survivors. We learn that the island worked its healing powers on not just Locke (in season one) but on another passenger on Flight 815. And we find out Sun is pregnant, though in a flashback it is revealed that Jin can't father kids. Possibly another survivor healed, or is there more?<br /><br />As season two draws to a close, Michael has reunited with his son, while Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley have been captured by the Others, leaving the door wide open to season three and beyond.<br /><br />What makes this set worth its weight are the extras. As I mentioned in my review of season one, the producers and creators of this show were thinking about DVDs the whole time, so there are a number of great extras. There are commentaries from various staff members and actors on a few episodes. There are deleted scenes, a gag reel, a UK commercial with the cast dressed in formal wear and makeup, a feature on making an episode and other behind the scenes looks at various episodes. However, the shining piece on the extra list was the Lost Connections, where viewers could view the connections between the various characters. While I had picked up on most of these connections on my second time through the season, this was still an interesting piece.<br /><br />All in all, this set was fantastic. Viewers can pause and rewind little things that they want to see again and they get a great look at what goes on behind the scenes. The producers did a fantastic job of preparing this show for DVD when it was shot and it shows in this collection.for his son to be returned to him are great and personally, what he does came as a complete shock to me when I watched the show on its original run.

B000002U8G|5.0|Okay, you have heard \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" a million times; \\"Wish You Were Here\\" a billion times; \\"The Wall\\" a trillion times.  Those records are tattoed on the synapses of your mind.  If you hear \\"Hello, hello, hello, is there anybody in there?\\" again you are going to faint; if you hear that cash register effect from \\"Money\\" again you are going to plotz twice and die (thanks for that one, Krusty!).  If you are one of the many like I have described, then I have the Floyd CD for you: \\"Meddle.\\"  1971's \\"Meddle\\" is the blueprint for much of what the band will do on later, more well known albums.   The long winding tunes (\\"Echoes), the lovely Gilmour vocals (\\"A Pillow Of Winds\\") the tunes about insanity (\\"One Of These Days\\"), the endlessly interpretable album art: it was all here first.  Because the thing has not been overplayed on album rock radio, there is a freshness to it that you can hardly find in \\"DSOTM\\" or \\"The Wall\\" anymore.  And to top it off, \\"Meddle\\" offers one of the most beautiful songs in the Floyd canon: \\"Fearless.\\"  That tune also has something a lot of later Floyd definitely lacks: optimism and hope.  And I love the football crowd (Liverpool? Celtic?) singing \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" as the tune fades.  And there is even a sense of humor on this one: \\"Seamus\\" has a dog singing lead.  This is a great record: my favorite Floyd record and one that is well worth your cosmic time.
B000FS9FC6|4.0|Some people absolutely hated this and others really loved it.     Many critics really panned this adaptation of the graphic novel, and the author of the original novel insisted on having his name taken off the credits - apparently before he even saw it. I thought it was a lot better than you might think from some of the critical reviews, but not something I will go back to again and again.     The film, like the book, is set in a future Britain some 20 years after a new far-right party has won power and established a police state. To be, or even to have been, a muslim, gay, trade unionist or a political activist can be a death sentence.     The heroine is Evey, played by Natalie Portman, the daughter of murdered political activists: at the start of the book she is rescued from police agents who were about to rape her by a mysterious masked man called \\"V\\" played by Hugo Weaving. \\"V\\" does not remove his mask at any time during the entire film, so Weaving has to act entirely with his voice and his body movements, which he does superlatively.     \\"V\\" blows up the Old Bailey and announces that the following 5th November he will blow up the Houses of Parliament. He also settles some old scores by killing several senior government figures who had taken part in nazi-style medical experiments on gays and dissidents.     The special effects are magnifient and there is some excellent acting: both Weaving and Portman are very good, and John Hurt is superb as the deranged dictator, Adam Sutler.     For all that he is playing himself rather than acting, Stephen Fry puts in a great performance as \\"Gordon Dietrich\\" a broadcaster and comedian who has worked within this system for years but eventually cannot resist taking the mickey out of the government. Stephen Rea is brilliant as Inspector Finch, a policeman who has been a loyal supporter of the governing party for many years but begins to have doubts when he is ordered to track down \\"V\\".     The plot is, in places, very silly. \\"V\\" treats Evey in an utterly implausible way. The film starts with some misdirected hero-worship of Guy Fawkes, which if you stop to think about it is quite offensive.    Fawkes was a very close 17th Century equivalent of the 9/11 suicide bombers, a man who tried to blow up hundreds of people in an attempt to force his own religion on a country which didn't want it, and his legacy was to whip up fear and hatred against people of his own faith which lasted for centuries.     And before you ask, we Brits don't celebrate Guy Fawkes every 5th November - we celebrate the fact that he was caught before he and his fellow religious fanatics could bring off their version of the twin towers atrocity.    Having said that, if you don't take it too seriously, this film is a good piece of light hearted, escapist fun. Perhaps that's why those who did take the original graphic novel seriously detested it.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|Navigating through \\"9,\\" his second solo collection of singer/songwriter musings, Damien Rice is evocative and self-assured. The follow up to his 2003 album \\"O,\\" which garnered both critical and commercial success, \\"9\\" is a sparsely-produced, relaxing listen ideal for many a college dorm and hospital waiting room.<br /><br />With a throaty vocal delivery uncannily reminiscent of alt-country rocker Ryan Adams, Rice sifts subject matter than runs the gamut. \\"Dogs,\\" for instance, is sure to be played by many guys in the hoping of getting themselves out of the, um, doghouse with their girlfriends, while the latent anger of \\"Elephant\\" finds Rice making a strong appeal to a woman manipulating his sex drive.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the 20+ minute opus \\"Sleep Don't Weep\\" at once sounds like a Moby-esque experiment, but is lyrically poignant and devoid of pretense, while \\"The Animals Were Gone\\" and \\"Coconut Skins\\" articulate feelings men can relate to through colorful melodies, passionate performances and, most importantly, lyrics that get sensitive without all the sap.<br /><br />Indeed, \\"9\\" is a winner. Rice has a lot to say, particularly to men, and his candid, stream of conscious approach to song craft is most endearing.
B000EQ5SR0|4.0|This is a clever adaptation of an MTV animated cartoon series.     I found it more plausible than the original, which is not saying much.    In favour of this movie, the action sequences are stunning, the film is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever scene (partly due to the sets and partly to the lead star, Charlize Theron in the title role). The characters are also more understandable and less morally ambiguous than the MTV original, and the actors brought them to life quite well.     Against this movie, the plot is still pretty implausible and sometimes also hard to follow.     The story is set 500 years from now, after humanity was almost entirely wiped out by a virus in the early 21st century. We are told at the beginning that a Dr Goodchild found the cure which saved the human race from annihilation, and that 500 years later \\"the Goodchild regime\\" is still in power.     After all that time there are still only 5 million people on earth, all in just one city. This may seem very strange but of the many apparently unlikely things in the story this is one of the few for which the plot does eventually provide an internally consistent explanation.     In the original MTV series there were two or more human nations and the \\"Monicans,\\" including the title role character, who were often  working against the government of the city where the story is set, were the agents of a rival city.     In this version there is only one city and \\"Monicans\\" like Aeon Flux are an underground resistance movement against what appears at first to be a highly repressive regime. In the original, the head of state, Chairman Trevor Goodchild, had recently come to power by removing the elected leader, in the film he has been in office for a long time - you'll have to watch it to find out just how long.     Aeon Flux is the principal Monican agent: shortly after the start of the film she gets orders to assassinate Chairman Goodchild. In the process of attempting this mission she findsthat the regime holds secrets which are even stranger than she thought, and neither friends nor foe are who she thought they were.     Charlize Theron gets to wear some very strange outfits and mostly very attractive outfits in this film, some of them obviously inspired by the wierd outfits from the original cartoon series, though mostly not as indecent as some of the cartoon costumes were.     Ms Theron looks very good indeed in most of these costumes but they are often ridiculously imappropriate for the missions she is carrying out. For example, who in their right mind would send an agent on a secret mission wearing a bondage costume which will draw every male eye in a millisecond and looks like it belongs on a catwalk?     And what kind of idiot would carry out a night-time infiltration mission to sabotage an ultra-high security installation wearing an all-white outfit ?     The movie also suffers in plausibility from the classic \\"Hollywood rules\\" of weapon accuracy and ammunition supply. Whenever the good guys fire a weapon they almost always hit what they are shooting at, but when either a bad guy or a computer controlled weapon system shoots at one of the heroes or heroines they almost always miss or hit a non-vital spot. And none of the good guys ever runs out of ammunition until a suitable point in the plot to show them changing a cartridge during a piece of dialogue.     Despite all these implausibilities the film can carry you along and I did enjoy watching it once. But it is probably a film to rent rather than buy.

Nobody expect it to be so raw and successful. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. \\"Compton\\" this track is very catchy, the drums of will.I.Am is crazy \\"One Man Army took out Reeboks myself\\" nuff said 4/5 <br /> <br />5. \\"Remedy\\" I love the lyrics in this one. 5/5 Just Blaze as a producer grew on me, he could be very versatile. Most producers I would recognize if it's their track... well Justin Blaze keeps me guessing everytime. <br /> <br />6. \\"Let's Ride\\" 2nd single, I can't skip this track 5/5 scott storch  <br /> <br />7. \\"Too Much\\" Bangin' I rolled up the mall the other day had the album two weeks advance. Everybody was lookin what I was bumpin... Had girls gettin they vibe on.. And ofcourse it's not a single without Nate Dogg. 5/5 <br /> <br />8. \\"Wouldn't Get Far\\" 5/5 Kanye West produced and gave a verse. Hot track talking about all these video women... It's funny I knew they can't keep they hands on rappers I mean they very successful, and these eye candy women are the ones in magazines talking about how innocent they are.. MMMM sure...  <br /> <br />9. \\"Scream on Em\\". Swizz Beats produced, this is one of my favorite beat by Swizz. The material and bass is just RAW. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. \\"One Night\\" talking about a lot of people include his homies he once was cool with. 3/5 <br /> <br />11. \\"Doctors Advocate\\" with Busta Rhymes. Dope, very deep. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. \\"Ol' English\\" 10/5 this is my favorite on the album. It's an instant classic whenI first heard this... This track you sit with you boyz and just reminice about the good ol days. Very Westcoast <br /> <br />13. \\"California Vacation\\" 5/5. str8 WESTCOAST, the beat is so hard, all the verses Xzibit, Game and Snoop all come with it. Snoop Dogg verse is the best to me. Hot <br /> <br />14. \\"Bang\\" 4/5 this track dope. Kurupt & Daz with Game? how tight is that. \\"I'm ma crip walk to get Dre\\" LMAO... hot <br /> <br />15. \\"Around The World\\" w/Jamie Foxx.... 3/5 it's aiight <br /> <br />16. \\"Why You Hate The Game\\". NaS the very intellectual verse as of course. The talented Marsha Ambrosious of Floetry I'll use her to if I needed a female verse. Just Blaze 5/5 instant classic great way to end it. <br /> <br />Overall had this album for about couple weeks in advance. Went out today and bought me a copy because I do want to see Game do well. Being from Cali, this is just what we needed to get back to the days we ran hip hop. Everybody no matter where you are, if you going to buy a cd nowaday make sure the artist doesn't rip you off with fillers. Game time homies!!! <br />
B000E5N62U|2.0|Donald Fegan was an extremely talented musician.  I absolutely loved both of his older solo albums, as well as all of his work under the name \\"Steely Dan\\".  The way his music flowed was unbeleivable.  Morph the cat does not sound anything like any of his previous work.  Every time you think that you get the flow of the song, he throws you a curve ball.  You cannot enjoy this music simply by hearing it, and if you listen to it you get bored by repeating lyrics.  Some of the songs were okay, such as \\"Mary shut the garden door\\", \\"What I do\\", and especially \\"Morph the cat\\", but do not expect to hear the old Dan.  I do intend on listening to the album through several (more) times, in order to give it more of a fair chance (although \\"IGY\\" and \\"Trans Island Skyway\\" sucked me in so that I couldn's have turned it off if I tried.)  If I decide that I like the album, I will post another review, but I don't think that that is likely to occur.  If you are a fan as I am, I strongly suggest that you don't buy this album, not to save the money, but to save the memory.
B000JLTRJ0|5.0|This movie was a very gripping and moving film that is to be commended for telling the story of two men who faced 9-11 and lived to talk about it.     This movie does not get involved at all in the politics or the newly emerging and highly inventive conspiracy theories that have since come about in regards to 9-11.     It is about two men, police officers, who get trapped in the collapsed buildings while in the process of trying to help evacuate the towers. You go through their struggles and those of their families throughout the movie. I am really impressed with Oliver Stone's work and the film he produced when he stuck to the actual story of what happened.     To those that say this movie is not moving I wonder why every single person I saw in the theater were wiping tears from their eyes at the end. I saw this in Bangkok and know that the audience had very few Americans (a low percentage have passports and few use them).    \\"There are risks to and costs to a program of action, but they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.\\" JFK
