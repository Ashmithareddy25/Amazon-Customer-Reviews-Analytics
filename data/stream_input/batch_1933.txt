B005OCFGTO|4.0|I purchased this item for my son for Christmas.  It was on sale at that time for $40 or so.  All the discs work and are in good condition. I am very happy with the discs themselves and he loves having them.  My single complaint is that the inside tabs of the case broken within moments of being open.  Does it matter? No.  I'm ok with it.  The discs still stay safe inside and are contained.  For the price, it's great!!
0060786523|4.0|This very large book is well worth the time it took me to read it ( almost two weeks).  I enjoyed the characters relationships with each other and the descriptive  settings of the novel very much.  Ido think that the politics could have been shortened by at least 20 pages as much of it was redundant.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is reminiscent of the mazes I would get as a kid.  The easy levels were too easy, but I understand kids would also play the game, but I should not have to pay for the advanced boards.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|So far so good, but I'm disappointed that its Chinese made. shame on you Gerber! Should have guessed it was.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is SO not a waste of time. It's a great time to doodle whatever you want. Who ever says this game is dumb is stupid. HAVE FUN!
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Easy to install and seems to do the trick so far, we'll see how long it lasts for every day use.
B008QCBFHG|5.0|An interesting opera by Handel, with some beautiful music.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is great. Has nothing to do with where I got it, just the fact that it is available to watch outside of when it is aired is OK with me!
B0055G0BGW|5.0|I am a Handel lover ,and this performance was magnificent as far as I am concerned. the cast are all wonderful anf rene jacobs is one of my favorite Baroque conductors.
B000VBIGD6|4.0|Everyone knows what it is about, has seen it, and has made it a tradition in their households to watch it every Christmas. Just adding to my collection.
B0058SNI5S|3.0|I have the black ballet flat croc - jayna style - and they are really nice. I wish they would offer 1/2 sizes as the rubber obviously is permanently non-stretching. I got a 10 and that's my shoe size, which is good but not ideally fitted, a 10.5 would be perfect, an 11 would be too big with the back strap falling off and not fitted to the foot. So, the caution with these is that there is no give with the material and it's either exactly right or not.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|GUILT TRIP is a welcome change from most films Hollywood powerbrokers tend to finance.  Like HOPE SPRINGS which was released earlier this year, this film is NOT the sidesplitting  comedy one would expect to see from the theatrical trailers promoting the film.  Instead it is a warm and endearing film focusing on a relationship between mother and adult son.  This is one of Streisand's most subdued but convincing performances in years.  She is not the larger than life persona we've seen in previous films.  Rogen gives a nice performance as Andy, a character very unlike others he's created in past films.  This is definitely a film I'll enjoy watching from time to time and sharing with friends.
B003CN4R74|5.0|I am a huge fan of evanesence ,I like all their songs on this album ,and I really like Amy Lee as an artist ,her voice is awesome ,this album like all her other albums never disappoints,I would recommend this not only if you are a fan of evanesence but if you like music on the hold,this product I highly recommend without a doubt.
B007XF0VW2|5.0|This is one of the GREATEST party movies I have ever seen. Hilarious from start to finish. I love the three main characters, they do a fantastic job of making you feel like they are really friends and that all of this insanity is actually going on. This is an all out, balls to the walls party movie, that you need to check out, even if just for a rental, but I guarantee you will buy it after you watch it!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Everything as a huge stars wars fan would want to buy ,it contains all 6 movies with awesome commentary ,deleted scenes and much more on the 3 bonus disk ,and to watch this dvd box set in HD is great is jus awesome,I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a star wars fan ,everything you can possibly want in star wars is right here,I like the box set jacket and the casing like storybook to fit the disk this was well done overall ,this is the reason why I give a sound 5 star but in my opinion it's worth 100 stars.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|it was a very good book.had plenty of action and alot of twist and turns in the story line.I would gladly recommend it,
B0098VXE50|5.0|gave it to my wife for a christmas present and she loved it. so glad i was able to find it on here.
B009B8YZKS|2.0|I love Halo and have played it for 6 years or so. Mainly multi-player. This movie is 343 production which should tell you something. If you like where they have gone with the franchise then maybe this is for you. It just didn't ring true for me.<br /><br />I think some of the other live action short films have been very good. The Peter Jackson/Neil Blomkamp stuff, the snippets for Halo 3, ODST and Reach, etc. Just makes you see how good a real Halo movie could be.<br /><br />There are some Halo moments in Forward Unto Dawn for sure, but they are spread thin.<br /><br />Yes, they built an actual Wart Hog (or possibly got one from Peter Jackson) but this is used way too much in the movie. It's in too many scenes and it doesn't look like it can go very fast. The actors look frail. Like a left over casting call from Twilight. There is a lot of touchy feely stuff that has no business in the Halo universe. The assault rifles look like they are made of plastic and the actors handle them like Nerf guns. The lead actress gets killed with a single needle (I think) from a Needler. Could they have thrown in a MAP FROM THE GAME when they are playing capture the flag or whatever they are doing? They use some silly tactic to win that's not possible to do in the actual game. Possibly talking to a few people who have played the game would have helped.<br /><br />They discuss military tactics like they are talking to a 3rd grader and show a graphic about it that makes no sense. Why did Master Chief not \\"stick\\" the last bad guy with a plasma grenade? He took the greande and dug around in the alien's suit before he set it off? Did ANYONE associated with the movie ever play the game?<br /><br />There is so much wrong with this movie for someone familiar with the game, that it would be difficult to write it all down.<br /><br />I appreciate the effort, I guess.<br /><br />I would rent it, if you are a fan of the game. Just to see those few moments...
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this book was good .it was funny and sexy . I would recommend it to most people that would be into s. and m.
B002VWNID6|1.0|This DVD only plays until chapter 17, about half way through the movie.  There is no way to skip or fast forward.  There are no more available chapters in the scene selection menu.<br /><br />We decided to buy another copy, because we thought we received a defective DVD, but the second copy had the exact same problem.  This is horrible quality control.  They are selling a product that is a complete waste of money!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|The Jack Ryan series has continued to hold my interest for over 20 years.  I had a tough time putting this one down.  As usual, I wanted more.  This book entertains and educates the reader.  It highlights the PRC emerging threat to world stability and their rapid modernization and arming of the largest military in the world.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The game is fun and offers challenges.  Can't wait to let my grandchildren try it. Would purchase another similar game.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time!!!!!!! I love this book!! Read it now get it
B000GPIPVU|5.0|This was a gift from my husband and is my absolute favourite album from Ray LaMontagne. This man has such a soothing and beautiful voice and is a joy to watch live.
B007SGM084|2.0|Mr Grey sets an impossible and unrealistic standard for how men should look and act.  See how stupid that sounds?<br /><br />I'm not sure why women get to enjoy pornography under the guise of personal revelations in public simply because its in a book.  I don't think if my wife caught me watching an adult movie (even privately) we could chock it up to me &#34;finding my inner god.&#34;<br /><br />Ultimately I believe that men want to believe that women are more evolved than they are.  Different but equal (and maybe just a bit better than us). To realize that women enjoy this uninspired, poorly written, boring trash that if visually realized (ie made into a movie) wouldn't appeal to even the most depraved basement dwelling male ironically gives women exactly what they apparently want; for men to respect them less.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy game to play when you need to pass the time!  It is a nice alternative to a regular solitaire game.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|exciting and wonderful graphics with great story line. I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. I hope there is a sequal to this game!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a very good book I hope you make a movie for it . I also want you to make a movie for the catching fire to!
B0057UD49M|3.0|This is a personal journey, a coming of age story that deals with some extreme personalities. Unfortunately, the illustrations don't make up for the lack of emotional appeal.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|Turned out to be a really good action/adventure movie. Took a bit of getting used to the look of some of the characters, like the captain, but I can't say enough about how pleasantly surprised I was at how much I enjoyed this movie. Well earned 5 stars!
B005LAIII0|5.0|It's been four years since Slumdog Millionaire took home eight Oscars. I found myself thinking of that movie because Life of Pi opens in India and the cast is predominantly comprised of Indian actors. Like Slumdog Millionaire, the movie uses several actors to portray the main character at different ages. In fact, the older Pi is played by Irrfan Khan, who appears in both movies.<br /><br />The story is framed with the older Pi relating his story to a writer. We learn that Pi's father owned a zoo, and his mother worked there as a botanist. His father is fond of giving Pi advice, and one memorable lesson involves a demonstration of how dangerous tigers can be, and that they should not be treated like a pet or a friend.<br /><br />Pi is shown at four different ages, but the bulk of the story shows Pi as a young man, so Suraj Sharma receives the most screen time. Like Cast Away and 127 Hours, the movie relies on one actor holding our attention, and Sharma does a wonderful job of doing just that. It's his first role and he had to show a vast range of emotions in order for everything to work.<br /><br />The first part of the movie shows Pi's life as a young boy. We see him go to school, and ultimately fall in love. But his life (and the story) is shaken up when his mother and father inform him that they have decided to move the family to Canada. Along with some of the animals, they set sail for their new home. If you have seen the trailer, or even the poster for this movie, it's not a spoiler to reveal that Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. I imagine that's quite a selling point, as a lot of people would wonder how such a relationship could possibly work.<br /><br />Director Ang Lee overcomes the limitations of such an enclosed setting in several spectacular ways. It's fascinating to see how Pi tries to survive, as well as co-existing with a dangerous carnivore. The visual aspects of the movie are of the highest quality, and I would be shocked if the movie wasn't nominated in several technical categories. The tiger is convincing, but the visual effects also shine when we are shown some of the things that can happen at sea.<br /><br />I think Life of Pi is a movie that should be experienced without knowing too much of the story beforehand, so I am not going to reveal anything more about the plot. Although I will mention that the ending is open-ended and leaves you guessing about what really happened out on the ocean.<br /><br />Religion is an ever-present theme. The movie will ask you to think about why the events in our lives happen, and whether they are random or part of God's plan. But more than one religion is mentioned, and it's not done in an overbearing way.<br /><br />The script is well-written, and is a big reason why the story works. There is quite a bit of humor, but it's smart and feels natural.<br /><br />I'm not sure how many movies I have seen this year, but this is one of the best. The story feels fresh and unusual, and some of it is profound and moving. I should also say that a few of the animals are hurt or even killed, so be warned if you are sensitive to such things. That said, you would see more brutality on a nature documentary like Planet Earth.<br /><br />Life of Pi grabbed my attention early and held it for two hours. It's more than special effects, with the screenplay and acting both standing out. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5n't nominated in several technical categories.

B009JBZH54|5.0|This box movie is great. If you like Batman, you need to add it to your movie collection.<br />The external and internal design is amazing. The content of disc is good, but it is bot enough. Although, the price and content relation is well.
0425252868|5.0|I've always been a history lover, especially WWII. When the common person thinks of war, a few things come to ones mind. One being the obvious hatred, a battle of the good guys vs the bad guys. I growing up watching the movies and documentaries, based around one of the most horrifying wars this country has ever seen. I was lead to believe that every German was a Nazi, and they were evil...until now. This book has changed so much about my views of history. This book tells the story of the living proof. Sometimes in life we find people who present themselves as the enemy but the truth is, they are just a sheep in wolf's clothing. I've learned the war fought over Germany was about death of the machine, not the people inside of it. I thank the writer of this book for such an eye opening experience.<br /><br />I never had a chance to meet my Grandfather, because he died of cancer before I was born. He never talked about his time he spent on the battles fields of France or Germany until the last few weeks of this life.  I remember some of stories from my Father retold me growing up. One story has always stuck with me over the years. My Grandfather was in a tug boat when a German submarine popped up beside him. The sight dropped his heart to his stomach and knew that was it. After the feeling of death stormed his veins, the submarine left leaving my Grandfather and a few other soldiers to live another day. During the finally pages of this book and for the first time in my life, the story I heard hundreds of times in my childhood made sense. I understood I should be thanking a German soldier for my life. As odd as that sounds for you to read this its true. If my Grandfather would have died that day my Father would have never existed, and I wouldn't be typing this. If we knew all the stories our family member could tell, I'm willing to bet the story in this book would give you a fresh start at life. Every solider during the war had a job to do, it doesn't mean they had disregard for life.....unless you were apart of the party, but that's a different story.<br /><br />I would give this book ten stars if I could! Check it out, it may change your life as it did mine and the amazing people found within the pages.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This was my first e-reader book, and what  doozy it was! It was thoroughly enjoyable and I didn't want to put it down. I hope it is but the first in a series, I look forward to many more like it. I give it five stars.
B0062YADWI|3.0|Good:<br />I like the size, feel, and look of the caribineer. The bottle opener works fine too.<br /><br />Bad:<br />This product is basically meant to be a nifty key ring that you can clip to your belt loop, so why did they make it so hard to get clip on and off. The clip's short length and hefty spring make it less than ideal for opening and keeping it open, but it's not too bad and I guess some people would feel like their keys were extra secure. If you're somewhere where you have to wear gloves though it might be a real issue for you.<br /><br />The biggest issue for me is the little hook for the metal clip to rest on means that the carabiner gets stuck on my belt loop every single time I try to get them off.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I love these movies and though I haven't been able to see all the special features yet, what I have been able to see, have been spectacular! I have been a huge Batman fan and collector since I was a boy and this is most definitely a must have for any Batman fan, collector, or for the movie buff! You will not regret it.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I thought it was going to be fun but no its cheap.I bate it.it stinks.don't waste your time on this useless app
B000FC0OOU|3.0|My interest in the jaded stories written by contemporary writers has lead me back to some of the old classics. I had not read any Hemingway books so I figured that I would give one a try. I read quite a few reviews of For Whom The Bell Tolls and I don't remember reading anything negative.I figured that I couldn't go wrong. Well, to begin with don't place much creedence in the reviews that you read. I found this book to be very uneventful and boring. I was tempted to put it down but I have a difficult time abandoning a book once I've picked it up. As I was reading this book I couldn't help but think of it as a poor man's version of Shakesphere. The repeated use of the words \\"thee\\", \\"thou\\", \\"whilst\\" etc. by a gypsy group living in the woods just seemed to me to be a contradiction. I plan to give Hemingway another try but I am not sure of when. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I enjoyed the book and liked the character development of Katniss and Peeta but I also felt something was missing.
B007R3AZNK|4.0|Again Joe Bonamassa is the best!! I recommend this CD along with most of his other CDs. I don't have them all yet but I hope to down the road. He is the best!!
B000FBJAOG|5.0|so far this book is going great! completly has me thinking of what to do when the zombie apocalypse happens! i love it and very entertaining! its corky and makes you think of some of those ideas that you thought you would do if this happens might now work. but also gives you some great ideas on what weapons are best and some of the best places to go if mayhem happens!
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Well, this is just delightful! I love the Scottish accents and the story was fun! I would recommend this  DVD
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|MY REVIEW FROM GOODREADS...<br /><br />Oh my gosh!!! This book is so amazing! At first I wasn't sure what all of the hype was about but then Holder entered my life, I mean Sky's life and things started to get pretty heated. Then I experienced 'the most amazing first kiss in the history of first kisses without even kissing!' Oh wait...again that didn't really happen to me and I am soooo jealous of Sky right now! I feel like the universe of all things intimate and sexual and angsty has extremely let me down at this point in my life! Ok, my rant is done for the moment...I have to get back to the book because I'm only halfway through it............<br /><br />I LIVED THIS BOOK!! I really liked it but I'm not ready to say that I loved it. So, Sky says it best when she scrambled the words together and came up with LIVE. A little bit of both words.<br /><br />The second half of this book was heartwrenchingly beautiful! Colleen Hoover's writing was breathtaking in this journey through one of the most excrutiating issues that a person could experience. When I started this book I was not expecting the immensity of emotions that I was confronted with. If I had known where the story would have taken me before starting, I'm not sure that I would have read it. While I'm glad that I did read it, I'm also glad that it's over. The ending of Hopeless was bittersweet and has left me with the everlasting reminder that there really is beauty in the breaking.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|You can't go wrong with a Joe Bonamassa CD. I enjoyed every track and will always be going back for more!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I'm hooked on this game. I like the fact that I get to draw the characters and the &quot;tools&quot; but I must admit it's difficult. At least for me. I've had to visit the facebook page quite a few times. But if you're looming fora fun game that's different than anything you've played before this is a good choice
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|I'm not an HBO subscriber so I order the season as soon as it is available and devour it in a matter of days!
0345803507|4.0|I enjoyed the sensuality of this book and it had a plot that continued to unfold until the very end. A great suspense and love story.
B005SZADQS|1.0|Hard to get through the whole thing. Not one redeemable theme. Glorifies filth. Especially destructive for teenage viewers. Pure garbage.
0345803493|4.0|This was a great story line and I especially liked the romance and sensuality in the book. James does a good job with describing the acts in the book. I felt as if I was there in the room with her.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Outside of Mila being awesome eye candy, the movie was the pits. I realize we are not dealing with Oscar quality movies here, but this one did not fit with the tone, quality, or effects of the previous movies. It just seems that is was a mismatch of ideas with no real story other than to show Mila run around in a  skin tight outfit (no complaints there :) ).<br /><br />If you have the time to kill, go for it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I really enjoy reading the court room thrillers and this is one of my favorites. I had not read Grisham in a while but Litigators was a page turner in deed. I would recommend this book.
B004H4XI5O|4.0|I downloaded this book over a year ago, but just read it last week. The history of mnemonics was interesting, and an area I plan to research further. I found the book to have less memory learning how-to's than I expected, which at first was disappointing. But I changed my mind after I looked through my notes. I found several powerful learning insights that I can apply (particularly the importance and specifics of deliberate practice) and solid references for detailed learning on developing my own memory.<br /><br />I thought the author's personal journey was a fun and unexpected element that made the story much more interesting. Seeing him transform from a \\"normal\\" person to US Champion was also very inspiring.<br /><br />Overall, this was a fun read and a great introduction into a new area of personal growth.
0345803485|4.0|The beginning of this trilogy sets the stage for the other two books that follow. I like how James set everything up and made the books follow eachh other so well. I would recommend this trilogy.
B0086700CM|4.0|I have a Kindle Fire and I was waiting to download this game like in forever because my friends play this game but I got other apps and I got a username or something like that on temple run and it shows on other games it says welcome back (my name) but I would download it, there's no harm or anything this is my opinion the game is really fun so four stars!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a good and challenging game especially when you play the &#34;Vegas&#34; style of the game. I would win all the time with the regular solitare but the Vegas style takes a little more skill...but I like it.
0307887898|5.0|Every business should read this and every Govt department should abide by it. Imagine that. How well would your country be run with these principles.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am taking my Kindle everywhere with me. Now I can check and update my Facebook whenever I can connect to a wi-fi network and I am enjoying it already.
030746363X|5.0|Very simple messages for all to adapt. Why is there any Obesity problem! They should have this book in schools.
B009FB3W9G|3.0|Have not been able to view it as it is in a different zone to Australia. When purchased it was very appealing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is like temple run, but its way better.It only requires your finger, and you don't have to worry about tilting your kindle to get coins. it is soooooo addicting and all I do is play it. it restarted on me once and I lost everything, but then I got the fun all over again. best tame ever. GET YHIS GAME!!!!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I actually watched the movie first because I was unaware that it was a book. But of course the book was a thousand times better. I could relate to it and there is a certain innocence about Charlie that reels you in and makes you feel everything he goes through. Everything.
B00846REIS|5.0|An amazing page turner, the story flowed and keeps you wanting more. You feel wrapped in Gideon and Eva. Couldn't put the book down.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I have read all of Gillian Flynn's books.  She uses a combination of human insight (sometimes to the extreme) and suspense to pull you in from the first word until the last word.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Second time I saw it I loved it more than the first time. One of Washington's best. Perfect casting on this one.
B000092Q4U|5.0|My son was very happy.  We were able to buy used as he is not picky that way and he was very pleased.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Wonderful mechanics are the lure.  It's fast, and easy...however:  between each game I had to<br />take time to tell an advertisement that I didn't want to participate in its service.  That slowed down<br />the &#34;fun&#34; of staying on to play another game.  I could probably handle the interruption once every five games.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This is an awesome series. Have now seen them all. So pleased this was an option. Great price and great quality.
B000U1ZV3U|4.0|Good start, slow middle, vague ending. - then a pretty good epilogue of sorts. Doc Holliday make the movie interesting - of course.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I picked this book up because I read in the newspaper a few months ago that this was a good read. I am absolutely not disappointed in the story or the message it sends. If you have some time on your hands, please give this book a read. I promise you will not be disappointed.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|It is playable, even a little easier to win than the desktop version, but not as good as the desktop version. (The cards have no spots, just numbers)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|One of the best games I played on my kindle so far. great graphics and a interesting storyline. can not wait for a sequel.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I still can't get it (the app) to work correctly. It runs you around in circles trying to use it or even download it.<br /><br />I like the Weather Channel on my desktop.<br /><br />Now, on my Kindle Fire HD, to get the weather channel I simply go on the net with it and search for the Weather Channel and then type in my zip code. My Kindle fire works that way.
B005XZHQKY|4.0|jacques cousteau son does very good... i miss jacque... i must say his son shows the same love of the sea that he did and all the wild life in it.. im so glad too see him filling with his fathers footsteps.. I could not help but buy this just for the reason i love these type of Documentaries..
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|This book was great, but while I gave the previous versions 5 stars, this one was a little less funny but fun to read. I love reading these books. It made me reflect on my younger years as a kid. I recommend this book and others in the collection of the “Diary of a wimpy kid.\\"
B0042ETJU2|3.0|the quality is good.. but i am very disappointed in the second movie what were they thinking..still a good buy for the price..
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game was pretty fun to play. I'm glad there was a hint button because there were moments where I didn't know what exactly to do next.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I wanted the DVD and mistakenly ordered on demand. I contacted customer service to ask to have my order changed but they did nothing.
B008QTV3X0|1.0|We loved the series. But the quality of the picture was horrible. I paid extra to have the HD version downloaded but the picture was pixlated and of very poor quality. The TV is a brand new Hi Def LED and the internet speed is in excess of 25 megabits per second so I know neither was the issue.  It was very frustrating to watch.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|Guy meets girl. Misunderstandings continue between. Guy and girl realize what \\"fools\\" they've been. Cute story. Too much self sacrificing going on.
0789325772|4.0|Pretty simple calendar, just like the illustrations in the book.  Got it for my daughters nursery (I actually framed my favorite illustrations in 12x12 frames)
2266199544|5.0|A very good read, in French, by a well known modern French author.  It is hard to find modern novels in French.  This fit the bill.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really enjoyed Dark Arcana: the Carnival, just wished there wasn't so much jumping around.  Also wish it would've lasted a little longer.
B007SGM084|2.0|The book is okay but not anything I would reccomend anyone to read. I didn't get \\"aroused\\" by reading it like everyone has told me. The guy in the book is too controlling and the writing isn't very good.
B0053O89WY|4.0|I really love the Big Bang Theory.  I was a gift to my daughter who also loves the series.  The characters are simply great and so, so funny.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was like none other in the best way I could imagine I would not put it down It was fantastic!
0451232852|4.0|I love historical novels and this one was very good and gave me a new perspective of WWI.  I can't wait to read the second book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Trust me when I say you will want to be a rebel weeks after you read this book. Truly inspiring, Suzanne makes Catching Fire a book who's theme is the old phrase, \\"Keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\\"
B00AOIKEZO|3.0|A tad too long...but interesting...good read in icy December...well done kindle version.  Keeps you interested about 60 percent of the story.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Could not put any of the three books down. I enjoyed reading these. I can imagine a world this way, we as humans must strive to love not hate.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|It was alright<br /><br />It was at first good nut I felt it was lacking something. And now assistants ky are apart again
B008N1LL42|5.0|LOVE this movie! It's fun, action-packed, and romantic in a quirky way :) Love the actors and the action all together!
B00004T9UF|5.0|If others would stop listening to the profanity and actually try to understand what this man is saying, they wouldn't be as offended as they are. You hear what you wanna hear and if you don't like what you hear, then don't listen to it. I personally think Eminem is highly talented for the way he puts words together. He actually tells a story with his music. I read one review about \\"Stan\\" saying about it dealt with \\"killing homosexuals\\"?? WHAT?? No. It was about an obsessed fan who stalked Eminem (and yes, fell in love with Eminem too) and he took the lyrics he heard literally. He thought Eminem actually did all the things he said he did to his wife, to his enemies, etc. No, he didn't. Eminem makes things up to make other people mad, people like parents who hate \\"foul language\\" and personally? Your kids are gonna hear it anyway.<br /><br />The point of his music isn't just about his foul language, yes I know he has a lot of it but imagine growing up the way he did with the kind of mother he had. Putting drugs into his food every day, she was psychotic and he kept his mouth shut for so long. Didn't once express himself when he was younger. Well....I can't blame him. I'd probably do the same thing if I was in his shoes. He feels resentful and what better way than to get out your anger other than something creative such as music? (or any type of art for that matter) I say its better to sing about killing someone rather than going out and actually doing it. I think its emotionally healthy.  Yes, I'm sure it hurt his mom to hear but I'm sure it hurt him to eat food with valium in it every day too.<br /><br />Dont like it? Dont listen and return it. Simple.<br /><br />EMINEM FANS UNITE! lol
B009O07NMA|3.0|A few songs are sort of rap, a few are country, and a few are rock. In my opinion it wasn't worth the money.I would have rather spent my money on an old Hank Williams Jr or Charlie Daniels CD.

B005KELQEU|1.0|This product does not fit the Kindle as advertised.  The dimentions listed say that it is 8&#34; long.  It's less than 7.5 and the Kindle is too long.  The discription is misleading and now I'm stuck with having to return it and try again.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I loved playing this game. It was very easy to play and I would recommend the game to everyone.It's a condensed version of the card game.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Greastest collectors edition ever!  It would've been even more awesome if it was the the Acutally cowl that bane broke!! But this will do. Thumbs up!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game .Like other games it can become addictive, but it is easy to play.I would recommend the game.

B008P1EWIM|4.0|I work overseas and found other programs don't cover all the cities where I work. So far Weather Live has forecast available everywhere I've been, and accuracy has been about 85 to 90%.
B005HSL626|4.0|I had fun playing this game .I would recommend it to everyone. best part about it is that it is a free app!
1439127700|4.0|I found the details covered here reflects the presidency in a different light, although it confrims my suspiscions that there's very little difference between the two parties and this is further confrimed by the fiscal cliff fiasco
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game. It was fun, addicting and easy to play. I would recommend the game to everyone.I like it more than the regular angry birds game.
B00008DDRX|5.0|This is one of the all time great racing movies. If you like cars, you'll live this one. Minimal interruptions from the usual love story stuff and just all out great racing footage. BTW Steve McQueen was a pretty good professional driver as well as a great actor
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|A story about witch (who doesn't know she is ) and vampire falling in love but an adult type story.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This had good racing footage if you like cars and racing, but also included a more complicated plot than &#34;LeMans&#34; and so it goes on a little more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game and i always will. This game is fun, addicting, and somehow relaxing. Its definitely a keeper.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones does great stuff and we enjoy her style, her song choice and her musical ability. Can't beat it for a romantic interlude.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I am enjoying this game. It gets more challenging as the levels progress and make you think and plan your next move.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I loved this movie and would recommend it to everyone.  Kristen Stewart was fantastic in this roll as Snow White and would watch any movie she's in.
B008A1TIOK|4.0|Max Richter proves himself a dab hand at reconstruction. It is better more sympathetic than the Carl Craig/Moritz Von Oswald effort.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I had heard so many negative reviews about this book that I was in two minds whether or not to read it.  I'm glad I did.  No - it won't win a Nobel prize.  Yes - there is a lot of sex; steamy kinky sex.  But the story was okay and I enjoyed the character of Ana.  If reading a sexy book offends you, then this is not the book for you.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A good book that holds your interest. A must is to read all three to keep the story going. Easy read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing read! Highly recommend if you like 50 shades of gray!!  I need more books like this! Opinions are certainly appreciated!

B000KRMZA6|1.0|i cannot play it on my dvd player.  It is not formatted for the USA.  I cannot send it back because it will cost me more for postage than the cost of the dvd.<br /><br />When I purchased it., it gave me no indication that I could not use it in my dvd player.
B0052GACNM|5.0|What's to say - I just love Tony Bennett and in his 80's will buy any music he continues to make.  A talented gentleman and the people he chooses to sing with offer a variety of styles and voices.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love the game a little stuck but it's all good walnuts for Christmas it's really fun and addictive haven't stopped playing it
B007MB5OCE|5.0|While of course this clever novel is pure fiction, the spirit of the very funny story has fundamental truths about the nature of human relations, world events, the follies of human undertakings, and it is a pleasure to read.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I absolutely cannot wait to see the movie and cast; truly in some ways I wish this was real life.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Not a full screen movie.  Movie was just a run of the mill ...nothing spectacular.  My neighbors enjoyed it. Thanks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Already halfway through the book I had decided that this was my new favorite, but when I finished it, it was more than just that. This book contains a little bit of everything. It made me laugh, cry and I guess the perfect word is FEEL. This book made me feel more than I have felt while reading before. It's perfectly written. As simple as it might seem in the beginning, the dark core of it all makes it that much more intriguing. I'd recommend this book a million times over.
0446580848|2.0|I have read or listened to all of DeMille's books and this was the worst.  His earlier books were riveting and could not be put down, and the infrequent smart-alec remarks and sarcasm kept me laughing. I had trouble picking this book up and struggled to read 20-30 pages at a sitting.  At 600 pages this book is very long but could have been 100 pages shorter if 95% of the sarcasm and witty remarks were removed. Another 100 pages could have been eliminated by removing most of the commentary and dialog. The plot and location was interesting though, especially since I have been to Aden, Yemen but the story line could have moved a whole lot faster.  And, I think the author missed many opportunities for action and suspense.  Actually the last 100 pages moved along quite well but I felt the book also ended too quickly, but I suffered enough. There were some interesting and potentially suspenseful loose ends that could have been addressed at the end.<br /><br />I feel it's time for DeMille to go back to his earlier writing style.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app really does work pretty well on the fire.  Aside from the occasional freeze, it has everything I need.  As some have already said, it can be slow at times.
0618918248|1.0|Despite being very sympathetic to Dawkins' position, couldn't find the patience and willpower to finish half of the book.  Dawkins cares too much about what the non-atheists think of his atheism, and is entirely too obsessive about what they write about him.<br /><br />The Selfish Gene was a great read, but this?  Well, it's not as bad as Young Earth 'literature'; I don't feel dirty after reading.<br /><br />Perhaps he can pen another biology and genetics book; I'd buy that.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Excellent Christmas album, love Rod Stewarts husky,rich voice on all of these classics. What a treat for the season! Love it, can't put it away even after Christmas. Vicki
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was very sad but had good feelings to it. I could almost feel I was there. 2nd book!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book was definitely  not what I expected but was a pleasant surprise.  I felt like it was a perfect combination of steamy and romance, which for me, is better than pages and pages of the same pillow talk.  I totally fell in love with the characters and cnnot wait for the next book to come out.

B004DM0UII|2.0|I liked it right after I downloaded it. I liked it when I was playing around with it. Easy to use and maneuver. Had problems connecting to a lot of stations. Had problems triong to figure out how to stop it and exit out of the app completely. I just ended up pausing it ans leaving it paused, until the middle of the night. It unpaused and scared me half to death, beings it was close to my head. I paused again and set it down. It unpaused once more. I, then, decided to uninstall  it. Thanks, but no thanks.

B002ZG976U|4.0|I liked this movie, even if it is a little unbelievable in parts. Christina A. can sing like nobody else, and Cher is always fun. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas, she asked for it. So we knew what we were getting.

0375703764|5.0|I'll try not to repeat what others must have said, and others after them repeated, probably a thousand times by now.<br /><br />1. The book is not as big as it appears (opposite of the HOUSE!) Many pages have just a few lines written on them, or the formatting is such that you can blow right through them. So don't be intimidated. It's actually a pretty quick read.<br /><br />2. The main story (about the Navidson HOUSE) is by far the most intriguing narrative going on in the book. It's like a Twilight Zone episode written by an unusually sensitive Rod Serling, if you can picture that. In fact, the idea underlying \\"The Navidson Record\\" closely resembles a Twilight Zone: remember the one where the little girl gets lost in her own house? Which a couple decades later influenced the movie Poltergeist, and even later a Halloween episode of the Simpsons? Not that, but like it.<br /><br />3. The Truant story is mostly forgettable. It gets in the way at first, because we want to hear about the HOUSE, not this apparently sexually-obsessed club kid hopping from liason to liason. He's kind of sweet sometimes, but mostly crude, and not well-spoken, worth listening to only when he writes about Zampano or the book. There are some neat touches at the end concerning him, in the Whalestoe Letters section, but that's about it. At one point, he goes on a journey to -- find the HOUSE? Sort of, but mostly to rediscover the secrets buried in his past, which we are not very interested in. It would've been a much better book had he found some version of the HOUSE somewhere and disappeared into it. Or at least the narrative about him would have been more satisfying -- and yes, I am aware that maybe Danielewski didn't want it to be satisfying (because the HOUSE never satisfied an expectation). But I am just saying how I felt reading it. And I would have liked a different ending for Johnny.<br /><br />4. The best scenes take place in the HOUSE. You never want them to end. Great fun, thrills andchills galore, and even intellectually engaging (something few other suspense novels can manage). Zampano's footnotes are a brilliant device -- they slow the narrative up in order to increase tension; but not with pointlessness. They're almost always immensely satisfying; firing the intellect just as the HOUSE fires the imagination. There's a fantastic two-step going on here that always keeps you turning pages, breathless for more.<br /><br />5. Unpredictable storyline. As it unfolds, you will probably begin taking stabs in the dark about what will happen next, and after the third or fourth time of being completely wrong, will find yourself, like me, charmed by the writer's inventiveness.<br /><br />6. Psychologically perfect. One of the keys to good storytelling is including realistic characters who possess the totality of real human minds; otherwise, all you've got is a neat idea through which mental puppets stumble. Everyone here, however, is so well-constructed that the whole suspension of disbelief thing happens almost automatically, and you're nearly instantly engaged.<br /><br />7. Why isn't this a movie?<br /><br />8. Smarter than any other scary book I've ever read (and I've read quite a lot). And scarier than most of them, too.<br /><br />9. Not really an \\"experimental novel,\\" as has been touted. It's told in a kind of multi-layered way, and has some different approaches, but nothing too radical. The idea of footnotes that refer to fictional sources might be the most original aspect of it. But it is mostly a linear tale. Other devices are gimmicks, I think, unless you write the whole thing using them. Or maybe not gimmicks ... Just neat little devices to poke the reader a little bit, keep him/her interested.<br /><br />10. What killed Zampano? And all those cats? Was Johnny's journey to Whalestoe what kept him from a similar fate?<br /><br />11. The real footnotes about labyrinths, caves, mythology, and etc., were so fascinating (and frightening in theirimplication) that I felt there should have been much, much more. Like how Melville stopped and wrote a dissertation on all the known varities of whales and so made Moby Dick a larger figure.<br /><br />12. The blending of fiction and reality, which has been done many times before, is done here with considerable artistry. I was blown away at times by just how well it was done. Yes! this, this is why I love literature, I often thought, for moments like these, because of books like this.<br /><br />Unlucky 13, containing a spoiler. If the HOUSE is history (which only non-entities inhabit, not even ghosts), how many, many nights it kept me up thinking about how the various minds shaped it? I can't even count them. Can't think of another book that disturbed my sleep so much, in other words.

0061714402|5.0|A really good read with a lot of insight into the heavy metal scene. Mustaine is a bit egocentric but he admits that here and it reads true.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game because of the challenges that lets me think for myself unless my family is around I am playing.;-)
B008RXYOKY|3.0|While this adapter works with FireWire 800 portable drives, it doesn't seem to support daisy-chaining even 2 mobile drives together, which really limits the usefulness of this adapter.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|My 4 yr old and 6 yr old love this! You choose a character and then style their hair- all the &laquo;tools&raquo; of a salon work as they would in real life- blow drier blows hair around, scissors cut, shampoo suds up as you move finger around on the characters head, etc. Wide variety of tools to use which makes for endless creations the kids can come up with- silly, serious, etc. Very cute and if you can keep interest of both my children you get 5 stars for sure!!!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|Mark Wahlberg should be ashamed of himself for taking part in such a filthy movie. My wife called it quits when at the beginning It was clear the director chose to use fowl language just for the shock value (kinda like 5th graders). My 19 year old daughter and I decided to ride it out with the hope it would get better........ It didn't! Here are some of the thoughts and feeling I experienced while watching Ted: Cute...not so cute...filthy....someone please stab me in my eyes!.... I paid for HD streaming I-Must-Finish.... weird.... Ahh sad.... OMG the Green Lantern is gay! Ted has stained Mark Walhberg career. One strike against Mr. Wahlburg, 2 more strikes and I'll see him on HBO, ONLY! Now to be fair there were a few funny lines in the movie, my favorites.. Rich black people can't all be wrong... The Flash Gordon flash backs... and the best; \\"Now if there's one thing you can be sure of, it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish. Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns AND missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry, an absolute death machine.\\" LOL

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Tragic, powerful, and mesmerizing, I like that it doesn't have the classic fairy tale ending. It shows the human condition, frail and imperfect and how we struggle to over come it.

I could hardly wait to get to the end of the story and now must get the next book.  The characters are real and I found myself cheering certain one on and suspicious of others.  This is a book with a great story and believable characters.  An enjoyable read
B007RQ6WCA|5.0|I have been using Dropbox on my main computer as well as my laptop and Ipod Touch and now on my Kindle Fire.  I checked into many similar products and chose Dropbox.

B00005JKZV|5.0|Of The Lord of the Rings trilogy this is my favorite. Obviously it is similar to the others in terms of content but the battle of Helms Deep strikes a chord with me which makes it my favorite. It is a wonderful movie and definitely worth buying.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|WOW!  How wonderful to have this film preserved in blu-ray and boxed so beautifully.  David Lean's film library ranks among the best films ever made by a director of great magnitude.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big Bang Theory is probably my favorite comedy on tv because its fairly simple storyline and yet hilarious situations. It is great for a family to watch and hours of great entertainment. It is perhaps the best season of the show.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This was a good read but I was hoping for more about the trails and hiking.  Instead it was a book about a woman with a difficult past and coming to terms with it.  It was an interesting and engrossing read, but not exactly what I was expecting.
1475143389|5.0|No B.S. just the truth. If you feel like you have the ability to educate or re-educate yourself and a hunger to change your life, then you need simple directions. This book has it. The rest is up to you. I have changed my body in the past but I never felt I reached my full potential. Why? because I never kept it simple. Go back to the basics and dont get caught up in the hype of crazy supplements and trends. I decided to forget everything I thought I knew and started with a clean slate and re-learn using this book. I also recommend the shredded chef. Most important thing you can do is get the right food down. 80% of your result comes from diet. You will be a chef more then a body builder if your doing it right. Watch yourself change! Awesome book! just get it!
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This doesn't have the &#34;read to me&#34; feature that a lot of interactive children apps have, but that is because it isn't meant to be a book.  Having said that, if you play &#34;with&#34; your child, you can narrate or explain, which I think is far more instructive.  My daughter understood how this works instantly.  Very intuitive, even for small children.  She loves seeing the same characters from the other Dr. Panda apps and always calls out their names.  Good way to develop spatial recognition and some hand coordination.  I personaly like that it cycles through many types of vegetables and grains, also illustrates the different methods of cultivation for each type.  Our children are so important to us, that since I started loading my tablet with these apps, it is the first time I have actively wanted to give a review.
0743243153|5.0|Received the book and it was brand new looking. I contacted them becuase there was a rental sticker on the back and they said it's mine to keep and I couldn't believe it. I think it was brand new
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have not been a reader in quite some time but this book pulled me into it from the very beginning pages. A wonderful book for anyone to read.
B004DM0UII|3.0|Why cant I save alarms? I go through the process of naming, time, reat, and the save button is greyed out. I did get it to work once, but I cant figure out how I did it. Help
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I had the free but couldn't read and listen. I enjoy that feature as well as the added sounds. It's just worth the money guys
B006LSZECO|3.0|I found this a fascinating read and was delighted at the twist part two revealed.  That is until I reached part three.  I found the last part to be ridiculous and completely unbelievable.  I hated the end.  It was as if Flynn didn't know how to end the book.  I felt the same way after reading Sharp Objects.  I suppose this author simply doesn't suit my taste.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|great game for kids teaches them to care for pets and the different animals there are , and how to collect them , easy game for a preschooler to play
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this author after her first two books which I absolutely loved, but I can say I read this book in one night just like I did her first two. I could not put it down and I am impressed with how she managed to work so many serious issues into the book without it seeming like too much. Loved both Holder and Sky and even both of Sky's friends were great characters that were hard not to love. Read this book, you will not regret it!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very compelling read. Reminded me somewhat of We Need To Talk About Kevin. Many surprise turns that you don't see coming particular the ending. Raises some gripping questions regarding parents coming to realizations about their kids and how to deal with those truths.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Loved the movie!  They should make more movies like this.  Not a lot of sex or violence.  Just a downright good movie
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The graphics were great quality and it ran very smooth on my Kindle Fire HD. I started out with the free version and had to keep on going so I purchased it. Once you start, you never want to stop.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|I bought this for my son and we watched it together. The band sounded fantastic, the quality of the video was great. What an amazing performance! It was almost as exciting as the 2008 concert I attended!
030745455X|5.0|i LOVED LOVED LOVED  this Trilogy !! (and the movies !!)  a  friend told me  that i needed to read them and watch the movies.  i love them !!
B00447L4JG|5.0|Purchased for my daughter because she thinks the movie is &#34;cute&#34; in a halloween sort of way, but really likes the story line.  Childrens movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Gone are the days when I hand over a five star rating. I've just read too many books and some have just risen the bar of expectation. I've become very selective.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover's Hopeless is one of those books that has received my coveted five stars. It has nothing to do with the fact that the writing was spectacular, clean, clear, and the cadence rhythmically in tune with the mood of the story line. Well, maybe it does have something to do with that. First and foremost, I can appreciate the technique, style and talent of the craft, and Colleen Hoover once again out does herself as she uses words and punctuation like an artist's brush stroke to create a beautiful masterpiece. On merit of the craft alone, Hopeless gets five stars.<br /><br />Novels require an additional element which elevate the artform to another level. The words need to come alive for the reader. We need to see the world through the character's eyes and feel their heart beat as we connect with the characters as they become real.<br /><br />Sky is a protagonist that is flawed, emotional, emotionless and perfectly real. She leaves the protective bubble that is her home schooled life and begins her Senior year at the local high school. Sky is your typical teen living in an non-conventional home. She sneaks boys in through her window, gaining her a reputation before she even opens her first textbook. Her best friend Six lives next door and the two have a true BFF relationship with movies, talks and icecream. Sky's life is unconventional in that she is technologically illiterate. She lives in a home without a phone (traditional or cell), no television, and no internet. Is this intentional? A lifestyle choice by her mom, Karen?<br /><br />With Six studying abroad, Sky must venture the world of teenage drama alone. Until she meet Breckin, self proclaimed best friend, and supplier of morning java. Six and Breckin are wonderful literary side kicks adding the right amount of flare, drama and humor allowing the central characters to come further alive for the reader.<br /><br />This brings us to the heart stopping Dean Holder. Dean Holder. Dean Holder. Holder. What can I say about Holder? Holder. His name should sum everything up. Sigh.<br /><br />Is there anything wrong with Holder? Sure! He is yet again another flawed character. Holder has a temper. He carries guilt and responsibility that doesn't belong to him. He's angry and...hurting. His heart, in spite, of his great losses is beautiful, gentle, and tender. I could feel his gaze, his touch, and his breath when he spoke. I could hear his words and his heart. I more than live Holder, I totally love him.<br /><br />Thank you Barbie for making me stop everything I was doing to read this book. You were right!<br /><br />And because at the end of the day, it was worth putting other very improtant projects on the backburner for a couple days. And therefore for all of the above, Hopeless is a five star.<br /><br />If you haven't read it....stop what you're doing and go read it.allowing the central characters to come further alive for the reader.<br /><br />This brings us to the heart stopping Dean Holder.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Have read all Vince Flynn's books and love them.  Can't wait for the next one. First book I put on my Kindle that I got for Christmas.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Can I just start off by saying, I am a 13 year old girl with a very high reading level, large vocabulary, and a passion for anything strange, out of the ordinary, or in this case, peculiar.<br />To begin, \\"Miss Peregrine's\\" is extremely well written. I love the way I can connect with the point of view of the main character. Jacob, is a teenager who is caught in between what he wants, and what he actually will be able to have, which seems to be the overall theme of the story. The descriptions of each character aren't exactly phenomenal, but Riggs makes up for lack of detail by inserting those almost wickedly lovely photographs, which brings me to my next point, the cons.<br />The kindle version of this book is completely in a different class than the paper/hardback. The integrity of the old photographs is not wholly lost in the digital implantation of them, but the fact that you are not able to view them more stably makes them less prominent of a factor in the story than the author likely intended. Another problem that I have found with this is that the story takes a very long, long time to get going and subsequent of that, the actual action- that in my opinion should build and be suspenseful- was a bit short and though the ending was profound, it cut off in an odd place. Don't get me wrong, I adored this book, and areas of it where I was unsatisfied were few and far between.<br />Overall a fantastic read and I highly recommend to anyone who takes interest in, young adult novels, tales of adolescent struggle, mystery with a bit of romance, or things that are just plain creepy.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone. I didn't want to put it down.  I can't wait to read the next book!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I got this for my kindle so my grandchildren would have something to read at my home.  Heard so much laughter, I had to read the book myself...it is a funny book.....but I truly see why and how the pre-teens can relate to the book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Such a good book. I say look out fantasy lovers! Percy Jackson books are the bomb!!! Wow I cannot imagine what to say about this book because it is so good !! Love the Greek gods and goddesses my favorite character is anabeth. And Percy Jackson. P.s.  to Rick. Please make a new turn in the next book .. thanks for the super cool books !!! Love Sara.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|sometimes...you want a card game and no one will be available to play....this can be played by just one person and it is so much fun.  and you can actually win...LOL...It can also be played by more than one player.  So of the rules are new to us, but we are learning as so go.  Enjoyed by all.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Never having much formal training, I basically play the piano by \\"ear\\". This app is so much fun and great for hand/eye coordination as well. Didn't hurt that it was free.
B001BWQVSG|3.0|Beautiful performances -- sound quality inconsistent. I think the recording engineers could have done a better job and should have..
B0092C2X7U|4.0|I love this game. It is easy to just pick up and play. My only suggestions are more levels and characters.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - New family favorite.<br /><br />Excellent movie, great cast and fun story line. Stays with you for days on end.
B000002IO1|5.0|I remembered her music from the 90's before I lost most of my hearing and always liked her :-D<br /><br />When I tried again with 90% less hearing, wasn't close to what I hoped :-(
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book is more for teenagers. I was not in the right mind set when I first started the book, so I wasn't even sure if it was a boy or girl talking.
B006FE83U4|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my son who has read the book but never seen the movie.  I was happy to find a 50th Anniversary Edition in Blu-ray and my high-tech son absolutely loved it.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|This was a perfect gift at christmas for the family OC lover.  It is beautifully packaged and contains all seasons for those who want to watch from beginning to end or just pull a single season to see.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great trilogy. The artworks that comes with this is awesome. I would recommend if u love batman but who doesn't?
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all of these two authors books and consider them my very favorite authors.  Their Pendergast series is one of the best series I've ever read and I am an avid reader.  I can't wait for the next book to come out by either one of these authors or both of them.....I never miss them.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I bought this because I only have one tv in the house. I always have people coming into my house trying to watch tv. This is great for situations where u just want to be by yourself and no ones bothers you so they can change the channel. Love this thing.
B002361MLA|5.0|I liked it so much that I bought copies for family and friends and to give to client's in my private practice.
B000BBOV8U|5.0|This is an excellent greatest hits collection.  I like the first cd best, but that is because it is all the songs I love.
B0063IH60K|2.0|will win consistently when playing vegas cumulative.  turn off your wi fi if you don't like pop up movies.  Fun to win all the time though.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|This newest Clancy novel is on par with his books since Teeth of the Tiger. It is not Red Storm Rising or Patriot Games, but it is still good.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best book  I have read in awhile. The characters were well developed an continued to grow throughout the book. I was sad to not see more of Six and Brecken because they're personalities were thoroughly entertaining. I felt like I was crying with them in every heartbreaking scene. The twists just keep coming an I couldn't put the book down. It was worth every penny !!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book was amazing. I really reccomend this book for ages nine to one hundred. The author discribed the charactors really well. i have read this book many  times and have enjoyed it.
B002SAUCBC|4.0|This was the first Stephen king book I've read that wasn't horror and prior to reading I had the notion that Stephen king only wrote horror stories. After reading I was astounded at the diversity of his skills at writing. The character progression and development is quick paced and keeps you reading, the description of the scenes in the book color a vivid picture in your mind. This has become one of my favorite books, a very exciting read from front to back.
B00838HRP2|3.0|I love the movie and it was fine on our computer.  However, it would not play on any of our DVD players.  Is there a problem that I can fix to allow it to play on both DVD players and computers?
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The title pretty much says it all. Campy in some parts and down right laugh out loud moments interspersed with &#34;gasp&#34; moments. I enjoyed it for what it was.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|A little surprised by how good it was. the sound quality is great and it was easy to use.plus I did not need a pre amp to hook it up to my sound system.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|If you need to do it from your computer, do it from your Splashtop. Multi-functional, definitely worth the time. Just do it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book keeps you coming back for more. I couldn't put it down! Must read. Great book. Never saw the twist coming
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Action packed and a page turner! Much better than the movies although neither resemble each other in any way. Great reading!
B00280LYHS|5.0|The best book ever but it left me hanging but it is still a good book.I love it ,it is a bummer  that they did not make another book
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I heard so much about this book. And it didn't disappoint. I read it in one sitting. Fantastic. I would definitely recommend.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I just started playing this game and it seems pretty cool! The only reason I didn't rate it 5 out of 5 stars is because the game is always begging for money.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am very hard to please when it comes to books and how the endings conclude the story. It was an amazing story with a great ending that won't leave you disappointed. I couldn't put it down.
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|Whether you are for or against gay marriage or heavily religious, this book will tug at your heart strings.<br /><br />I think everyone can find a note, line, chapter, or page to relate too.<br /><br />I found a couple chapters to be rather slow but aside from that I raced through the rest because I just needed to know what was going to happen.<br /><br />I wish the end was elaborated a bit more, would love to know what happened to these families.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|Its a nice cover, havent had it long so far does its job!  Will let you know the longer I have it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Purchased as a gift for my son who is a super hero movie collector.  he is very happy with this movie collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift. I got all three movies for the price of one at Best Buy!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I purchased this episode as  gift for my son who collects movies.  He was thrilled when he opened it Christmas morning.
B003THJA1G|5.0|I never actually watched Castle 'til I saw a show in sydication. I became intrigued with the character and and in process of watching the first season. So far, I love it and I will try to catch up with the entire series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The beginning of the book was not the best but it got a lot better. The end was a little sad when prim died ! She was probably sad  that Gale and her mother weren't going back to twelve with her. I wish that the series kept on going.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|I love Nev Schulman.  As a woman married to a man she met on the internet 10 yrs ago, I can identify with online dating and the trials and tribulations of the whole process.  Nev shows nothing but sweetness and genuine heart throughout the movie and in his MTV TV show CATFISH as well.  You should check it out on Monday nights!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was the best book ever<br />I can't wait to read the next book of the series<br />Mocking Jay !I can't believe that they didn't get peeta out of the arena.what happened to greasy sal
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Yann Martel is an amazing author.  The writing is incredible - i can't even explain it!  The story is beatuiful and hard to read at times for an animal lover, but such is the circle of life.  Great book, get out there and read it!  Cant wait to see the movie :)
B004EPYZOO|5.0|A great action flick that has hells demons playing the good guys!  With that in mind there is a lot of profanity and nudity, hence the not for the under 17 crowd comment.  This movie has it all, fast cars, a bar room brawl, and bad guy that you can't wait to see killed and a good male/female duo.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|I'm from St. Louis so I have a soft spot in my heart already for this story. It is a terrific family story with characters with very distinct personalities. One of the best features of this movie is the fall/winter atmosphere. One of my favorite scenes has got to be a Halloween scene with all the neighborhood kids in the middle of a street. It is hilarious. They are burning furniture in the middle of the road and talking about basically assaulting people (I assume they were joking). It's surreal... because today these kids would basically be considered a criminal street gang! It's funny stuff like this and heart that makes this an amazing movie. And the Bluray picture is amazing! Colors pop and the image quality is very clear. The packaging for this Bluray is a digibook format and is very sturdy. It includes several pages of color photos and facts about the movie. Highly recommend!
B0096PAA6E|3.0|I chose &#34;Good&#34; because it did not live up to what I had read about it in magazines and online.
B00ARAO720|5.0|I loved this movie. I enjoyed the reality, the plot, the action - pretty much everything. The stunts were great.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|This CD does not live up to all her past performances. I never expected to feel this way about her as she is one of my favorites.  Holding out hope for the next one !
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game w/good assortment. Fun games that dont take a ton of time. I like the 10 game play and having to advance to unlock more.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great read! E L James has my vote, I would love to see a movie made or a mini series.
1419705849|5.0|Our daughter loves this book!!  Was a great Christmas present!!!  Highly recommend!!  Just as good as all the others in the series!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book kept me interested throughout, and brought tears to my eyes. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys romance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't able to put it down til it was over. What a horrible thing that would be if the hunger games really existed. This book was exciting and kept my attention the whole was through. Loved it all the way!!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Really good example of diversity in one genre<br />Great songs and range for toe tapping events or down time and introspection.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I highly recommend this book for the sheer fact of the excitement involved. Very well written and a page turner.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|I purchasesed this game to avoid the interruptions of reviews an  sharing...what's wrong with it?<br /><br />I'm morefrustrated transmitting myself as a owner.....
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly delivers Bosch  as he always does.<br /> The hard boiled detective with a soft spot for the victim and the truth.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Horrible couldn't find the word<br />Maybe if you put the word and the definition and what is it only would make it better
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Arrived before expected, even!  Seemed to please the recipient. It was on his list. Multiple functions and uses.  Small and handy/easy to store.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This was legit an amazing book and could save so many lives. I recommend this book to so many teenagers so they just can know what words and actions could effect so many lives even if that's not how they planned on it to go in the first place. Take it from a teenager.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|I found the game confusing and without proper directions on how to play. I am still working out the details. Thank goodness for the grandkids knowledge.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's great if you go on Facebook a lot, but today I had to delete the app twice because when I would go to open the app it would take me to Yahoo for some reason and I couldn't even get out of it to go onto Facebook.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After having read both books 1 & 2, I<br />Can't wait to read book 3.  This book was very well written.  Every page made you want to keep going g until the end.  Very difficult book to put down.  EXCELLENT!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Levels are very challenging.  This game is has proven to be a good way to release stress.  Very addictive  I love it!
B009NQKPUW|1.0|Derivative plot, predictable, stale dialogue, unbelievably stupid characters, etc.  Was not expecting Bergman, but hoped for something along the lines of \\"Alien.\\"  Alas, fancy CGI ruins yet another film.
159420411X|5.0|I had been a Nate Silver fan for a long time and had his book pre-ordered, so have had it for months, reading a little bit here and there, and enjoying my \\"slow read\\" immensely. His rise to great fame around the 2012 Presidential election was interesting to watch, and while hype and showmanship surrounded all sides through much of that discussion, this book shows how he is really well grounded in his (and related) fields of stats forecasting. This is a great book - really sheds some great light on forecasting and stats - topics I have studied and worked around most of my career, but still found excellent (as well as fun and interesting) insights as provided by Silver. I will be using many examples here in my Econ and Marketing classes.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I haven't received our copy yet, but we watched it at our daughter's home and found it to be more entertaining for adults than we thought it would be, so I decided to purchase it for our film library.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|So if you're under the age of 50, you probably won't appreciate the subtle humor of aging and relationships presented in this movie, but if you are solidly in the boomer demographic, you'll truly get it. Tommy Lee Jones is great as grumpy curmudgeon. He deserves to get Mathau's role is a re-make of Grumpy Old Men. Streep is, well, Streep. Always a splendid performer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this isn't something I would normally read but if was so hard to put down. Reading these words had me laughing crying and even angry. I can't wait for book 2. All I Can really say is wow. Amazing.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The most unusual story please don't tell me how manny words to use.....I consider that very rude....like a grammar school teacher
B000FC13UE|5.0|this is a great book. Neil Gaiman is one of the best writers of today. These short stiries were wonderful.really agreat buy.Smoke and mirrors is one of his best.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|I had a hard time watching it. I really wanted to like it but it was over the top cheesy.  The CGI was also poorly done and when they were moving around, it looked clunky. Wait until you can get it at home...for free
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have previously read this book in hard-cover years ago.  Having been interested in the human condition and psychology and philosophy for my entire life, this book is extremely interesting on all levels.  It is a true story of Viktor Frankl's own internment in the Nazi German concentration camps brought to the world as a first-hand account of the experiences and conclusions of a learned and brilliant psychologist, who went from respected professional to holocaust prisoner to holocaust survivor.  He has turned his brilliant mind to analysis of the experience from a perspective that no other mere researcher could ever achieve.<br /><br />It is moving, horrifying, and educational.  Well worth reading, and I bought it for my Kindle so that I could read it again and have it with me as a reference.  We must never forget either the lows or the highs of which human nature is capable.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Stephen King, Mile 81 (Simon and Schuster, 2011)<br /><br />Stephen King is well-known for logorrhea, and it's been warranted since about the unexpurgated edition of The Stand. Which is not to say those thousand-page doorstops are not worth reading; they are, and most of them are very good. But it has always been the case, and I suspect it always will be, that King does his best work in the realm of the short story. \\"Grey Matter\\" and \\"The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet\\" and \\"Blind Willie\\" and \\"Survivor Type\\" and \\"My Pretty Pony\\" and \\"I Am the Doorway\\" and \\"The Mangler\\" and I could go on all day. That's the good stuff, and I say this as someone who has traditionally listed three King novels among my hundred favorite books of all time ('Salem's Lot, The Stand, and Misery). So I guess you could say I was kind of predisposed to like \\"Mile 81\\", which feels like a return to the good old days. (This is, of course, an absolute myth. It's not like \\"My Pretty Pony\\" came out of nowhere. \\"The Last Rung on the Ladder\\" and \\"The Woman in the Room\\" closed out Night Shift, and I found them unbearable until I was well into my twenties because they weren't horror stories.) This is what King does best--take something as quotidian as can be (a crappy, generically American station wagon covered in mud) and make it scary, throw a few unsuspecting folks into its way, find the least likely hero you can, and make a story out of it. It's formula, but it's Stephen King formula, and it's been working like gangbusters for more than four decades now. In other words, if you like his stuff, this should work for you, and if you don't, this probably isn't going to change your mind. I find nothing at all wrong with this. *** ½
034580404X|5.0|I was hesitant to take the time to read these books, mostly because of all of the hoopla and hype over them.  But I have to admit I did enjoy them.  It was hard to put them down.  If one has not been in a relationship of trust and bondage, it is difficult to understand the mystical magical power it has.  The complete abandon of reality; of letting yourself go to places you never imagined.  There is something to be said of becoming someone you never dreamed you could be or participating in activities you never thought you would ever do.  It is all about power.  I thoroughly enjoyed these books.  I was sad when they ended.  I felt like I had broken up with Christian, that our relationship had ended all to quickly.  Are they the best books ever written, of course not, but they left me with remembering \\"My Sir\\" and how he changed my life.  Now all I need to do is, once again, find my Christian.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is an Amazing super fun game with cool and cute dragons amazing graphics and updates. Best game ever. You Should Get It.
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|It's a really boring and stupid movie! I was exspecting it. To be cute and not Tht good of a movie but it was like really stupid and it wasn't cute either also very predictable
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this is the best alarm clock. ever had.<br /><br />My kids even like it and think I am funny because I use the rooster.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a really good movie. It was a little too long for the 5 year old, but perfect for the 8 year old.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app makes planing trips easy for me because it shows how much battery I have left and the amount of time per application I have left until the phone battery dies.<br /><br />I am using a Samsung galaxy 3
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book.. delivered right to my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for my reading within seconds of my purchase.  What a great price on digital purchases..
B004DM0UII|1.0|Saw this app and thought it was worth trying since it was free, so downloaded and installed it and played with it a bit. Later (same day), ran Pandora, which did not work (&quot;Unfortunately, Pandora has stopped working.&quot;) Seemed strange so checked other devices and Pandora worked fine. Rebooted my Droid RAZR M, Pandora still not working. Long story short, after uninstalling/reinstalling Pandora (still didn't work), I then uninstalled Xiia Live Pro, then uninstalled/reinstalled  Pandora and it worked fine again.  Since I feel I get a much better value from Pandora, I'm uninstalling Xiia and giving it one star.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book.. delivered right to my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 for my reading within seconds of my purchase.  What a great price on digital purchases..
B008VBYN80|2.0|My husband and I both downloaded this app. Me on my Kindle Fire, he on his IPhone. Neither of us could add friends, and the game freezes up your device frequently.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I wish u could have survivel. I've seen that u can have survivel on other devises and I don't think its fare. I hope Mojang will make an updated app soon. :p
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Ok this app is awesome!!!!!! Super scary!!!!!! But it sucks because if u have the kindle fire HD the game flips and u can not play the app. I highly recommend this app to people who do not have the kindle fire HD. They need to update this app so the people who have a kindle fire HD can play as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an awesome games you'll love it. Of you love temple run or Temple run brave than you'll deffently love this game.  Its fun for all ages.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I am so happy I purchased this series on BlueRay. Now I can watch it for years to come. It has a lot of bonus material and interviews with cast and crew. Very worth it.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|The reason I buy this movie is that I am collecting my favorite actress, Jennifer Lawrence who is a great actress and I enjoy this movie.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|At first I was hesitant. But when I started playing and grasped the concept, I fell in love. I recommend this game to whoever loves a challenge.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is really fun to play and increase skills and make it more harder at each level but it is really fun to play.
B003EV6DBW|3.0|I have encountered a problem with these Blu-rays, the extras and previews play great but the episodes skip and the audio cuts out frequently, but only on my Blu-ray player.  On my husband's computer and my son's Playstation 3 they play flawlessly.  I'm very disappointed and confused.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I collect DVDs with Jennifer Lawrence and this one is one of them.  It is really good movie for any comic fans.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I truly love Mahjong and this one is no exception.  Just what I was looking for, easy to understand, different puzzles, colorful and different backgrounds to choose from.  I have played this several times since I bought it, find it hard to put down.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|It is a gift for someone and I don't have a say for this, but was told it was a good movie.  Someone is exciting to have this one.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Its a charming and nice movie for the kids,..My niece saw it and the rest of the family and love it,..! and the price a bargain..even better,,
0240815807|1.0|The book is for someone with some money. He starts off telling me that my Rokit 5 speakers are no good and I need to buy something else. But this is what home recording people are using. Then he goes into mineral treatments for the room, etc. A bedroom producer is not going to put a bunch of mineral panels around the room and spend all that money. This is not what I need. I need &#34;How to record a vocal using your DAW and an SM-58.&#34; There was none of that.
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|I love old classic movies so when I found this original Robin Hood movie I was thrilled. While some old movies may not view well, there were no problems with this rental.  If you love Robin Hood, then you will enjoy this one. Happy viewing.
B009KNPNT6|5.0|I loved the remaster.It was like hearing Slowhand for the first time.I can hear the difrence from the original.I would tell Eric Claptin Fans this should be in their collection.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Me and my 6 year old Grandson watched this movie on Christmas Eve and we really liked it.  It was a little long but very enjoyable.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Very good movie with decent action sequences .  The motorcycle chase was the highlight of the movie.<br />Some of attempts to interweave the Jason Bourne storyline were choppy and detracted from the plot.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I loved The Expendables 1st movie so I was excited to see the sequel.  I loved the sequel even more including all the campy tributes to our many action hero's cameo appearances.  The action started from the beginning and continued to the end.  This time the story was much better and that made the intensity even more thrilling. Good movie.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I like the character, Jack Reacher, and his style. Love Lee Child's story telling, which is a little different.  Also, the author's detail is top-knotch, more importantly, there seems to be something for each reader, male or female--one can identify with the characters and how they relate to the plot.  Really good book, which has caused me to read book 2 and am now on book 3!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I am not usually big on period piece movies with the exception of Gangster and adventure action. When this movie started I thought it dragged a bit, but as the story grows it gets intense.  Boy what people went thru to get a drink.  This movie is as much about depression times as well as all the surviving families went thru.<br />Tom Hardy is a Great Older Brother trying to take care of business and Shia LeBur is excellent as the baby brother.<br />Great movie and I recommend it.
0684857219|4.0|Great book for learning about not just muscle building but lifting weights for strength, fitness or muscle.<br />The individual exercises and the sample workout routines are very helpful when getting started or even back to your old routine.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|At first I thought it was an interesting and entertaining game. I was really beginning to enjoy playing until it stopped letting me play for free. Couldn't even get back into the game without paying. They should be  more clear in the beginning exactly how much free play you get.  The game also caused my phone to freeze up a couple times. Haven't had it lock up on me after I uninstalled the game. I am a bit disappointed because it has great reviews for the most part.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|The game is really fun, no complaints there but the quality of the cards are poor. We have only played it about 5 times and the cards are falling apart. That is kind of disappointing!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Did not see the movie. Read this on Kindle, thank God, as bookmarking made it easy to go back and forth with the stories. I need to read this book again as the archaic and invented words made reading a slow go. I would recommend being at the computer with a Dictionary ready to read this book more smoothly. Connecting the characters from century to century was challenging also.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was skeptical about this book after reading the first, thinking it'd be a letdown, but I was wrong. Suzanne Collins pushes the plot and the characters in challenging ways, and really helps the series along. Definitely worth a read as the second movie draws closer to hitting theaters.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|Sedaris as always is understatement and flamboyant: a laugh per milli-second. What a great way to start the day by reading one of his chapters on Kindle and at a great price from Amazon.com.
B003L77FYS|5.0|My fiance got me hooked on this show a couple years ago, and it has grown into one of those we watch whenever it's on. The cast dynamics keep getting better and better, and the acting is solid as always. Even if you've only seen re-runs, buy the seasons and get caught up.
0425263908|2.0|I thought it was so unrealistic.  I was really sad as I ordered both books thinking<br />they would be similar to 50 Shades of grey.  No way, I couldn't even finish them<br />they were so unrealistic.  I did not like the character she was very whiny<br />and all over the place emotionally, I could not relate to her at all.
1401323820|4.0|I got this for my fiance who is a big fan of the Castle TV series - she read right through this and all the other books in the series as soon as she got them. She said it was really easy to see the characters from the TV show in your mind as you read, and that the book was well written as well. This is a good buy for anyone who is a fan of the show or just someone who likes crime novels.

B00A3AUGEW|4.0|Love his voice and most of this music. There are a couple that get a little boring but most are great mood music. And I love HOME.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|My fiance got me hooked on this show a couple years ago, and it has grown into one of those we watch whenever it's on. The cast dynamics keep getting better and better, and the acting is solid as always. Even if you've only seen re-runs, buy the seasons and get caught up.
B009A9BF5G|3.0|Don't know if the producers were in so much rush to carry this out, that forgot to increase the image quality...
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric Church is my favorite male country artist, and this CD is the predominant reason for that. His newer stuff is good, but the songs on this disc are great. They are easy to relate to and they are what country music should be - not the crap Taylor Swift and others put out (and especially not as bad as that crappy TV show). Eric takes it back to the way country should be played, and he's even better in concert.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|A marvelous film that has outstanding performances by Jeff Daniels and Anna Paquin.  It is a sensitive film that draws out<br />the love of a father for his daughter.  After his daughter and estranged wife are involved in a deadly accident in New Zealand, the father must deal with a thirteen year old girl suffering from the loss of her mother, and moving from  New Zealand  to Canada.  They bond in a delightful way and participate in a wonderful adventure togheter.
B004ZQRJFO|3.0|...and I'm pretty sure that's the only one (Lighters) I've ever listened to off it. Eminem is solid as always, but this disc doesn't do much else beyond the one song.
0525951652|4.0|A marvelous book that delves into the life and culture of several characters in Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States before and during World War I.  Extensively researched and written with flair, this is a well prepared narrative that sets the stage for the second and third volumes of this trilogy.  It is cumbersome in places, and does not fully explore many of the key developments in how Europe went to war in 1914.  However, the way Follett interweaves the various stories of the different characters, and underscores the tyranny of feudalism in Europe and England will impress the reader.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I love ZBB and nearly all of the stuff they put out. This is a solid disc for anyone who is looking for good country music.
0345803493|5.0|Can't wait to read book three of this trilogy. First fifty shades was great, however, it left the reader hungry for the answers. Fifty shades darker satisfied much of the curiosity. I'm a 60 year old woman. This is tasteful erotica in my opinion.
078689136X|4.0|I got this for my fiance who is a big fan of the Castle TV series - she read right through this and all the other books in the series as soon as she got them.

B0087YPCYA|1.0|I basically bought it for the nudity and there wasn't nearly enough to make it worth buying or renting. SUCKED!!
B0050PLT8W|4.0|This CD was pretty good - I like a lot of TOAD's other stuff, and this lived up to expectations. Preview before you buy - perhaps even YouTube all the songs.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|It is a very Good and entertaining movie, not as good as the first movie but still a good movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a good book even for adults to read - perhaps even worth reading with your kids. I really liked it, and it does a good job of making you think about society and how we look at our entertainment.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|This is one of the worse movies do not rent not buy. I couldn't finish the movie it was horrible stay away take my advice. The service from amazon is outstanding but this film.... Stay away
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I really like Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in just about anything they do, and Olivia Wilde is stunning (as is almost always the case). Good for fans of sci-fi - I haven't read the graphic novel this was based off of, but it's definitely an entertaining movie.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|New Intel i5-3570K Ivy Bridge with stock cooler.  Scraped off the included thermal paste, applied a line of this on the processor, and temps are nice and cool.  No need for anything fancy.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|Downloaded quickly and easily on my tablet.  This is my favorite Jane Austen book, so I'm glad I can take it with me everywhere!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|Watched adaptation on Sundance and loved it. I usually like to read the book first and didn't this time, but still enjoyed the read. I hope to read more from this author.
0385360185|1.0|Bought this as a Christmas gift. With everyone getting colds and viruses, we just exchanged gifts this week. Tried to play this, and it did not work properly. Now I find out that the date has passed when it could have been returned for a full refund, and I would only receive a partial credit and pay shipping. I am disappointed in this penalty for not even trying it before now as it was a holiday gift. Lesson learned not to buy these items from Amazon in the future.
B009GX6600|5.0|I've always loved watching NCIS shows. I've got all the seasons on my HD Kindle Fire expect for 1of the seasons.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I loved this book. I didn't understand the hype of hunger games. I was completely uninterested but read it anyway and now I'm addicted. Total fan. Can't wait to watch the movie now.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My cord didn't work for my kindle fire and was happy amazon replaced it quickly w/ 2-day shipping thanks!  Works great now!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Illogical uses of technology and just plain suspension of logic.  Traveling thru the earth's core to go to work on the other side of the earth?  Central planning is certainly inefficient, but, hey, come on.  Orwellian style repressive society with the technological advancement to build superhighways and floating cars, (to say nothing of gigantic vehicles that travel right thru the earth's core!)but no way for police to remotely disable a car of which they are in pursuit?  Good grief, isn't there controversy over being able to do that very thing today?  There were just too many inconsistencies for this movie to be enjoyable.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I really enjoy this free app and has recommend to others whom want to play pinball to kill some time.  However, beware it can become addicting so watch out!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I thought the book offers a good insight regarding the frailty of life. Worth the read!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is by far the best TV Series ever produced. It comes with a guide summary and a conversation about how the series was conceived.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't want to put it down. Suzanne didn't stop with the suprise.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I enjoyed the game just wish there was more for the money. there should have been s little more to the game.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|so glad i bought it! listen to it non-stop can't stop listening to it and i love her so much already
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This is my first book review, so bear with me. The plot has a lot going for it, and could have been something good.<br /><br />My biggest issues (SPOILERS!!):<br />1. Editing: There where so many typos, or misspeelled words that wood easily half been caught bye a spell check and grammar check. (&lt;- Some sentences looked like this!)<br />2. The entire book seems to take place over 5-7 days tops. But there are so many inconsistencies within the story.<br />  ex:(1) First day in castle during the big celebration he gets drunk, and wakes with hangover, 2 days later he's taken to a pub/brothel and he's never had a drink before!?<br />  ex:(2) He has a panther cub in his shirt, he does a bunch of stuff, and later he still has a cub in his shirt.<br />  ex:(3) He warns the king that he will be poisoned, 10 minutes later after the thwarts the poisoning attempt by knocking the cup out of the kings hands, he's thrown in the dungeon for attempt to kill the king!<br /><br />  It just seems like the author didn't have anyone to check out the story line, or give him any idea's.  Not if this is due to how easy it is to create a book and publish on Amazon without any major publishing house backing it.<br /><br />Oh, and for paying for a book that is not finished I am changing my 3 stars to 2.  It ends at a bad time, like the author is desperately trying to force people to buy the next book in a series that isn't even written yet.  I haven't read any other vampire series, nor would I if this is how the authors work is written.  I Have no clue if the people that gave this 5 stars are friends of the author, or just from a paid service used to create high ratings.<br /><br />PS. If Morgan Rice reads this and would like someone to proof read your next work in this series I would do it just so others wouldn't have to pay for something that seems so 'not finished'.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I just started playing and this is a great hidden item game.  It isn't very easy to follow but I love the hunt.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Not too easy,  not too hard.  Really a nice relaxing fun game. Looking forward to another similar game like this one.
B004GFN11A|5.0|I haven't posted many blogs yet, but intend to do it more... WordPress is fun, easy and has so many features you will enjoy!  Many great looking free templates, I had some difficulty with widgets and changing themes, but figured it out.... I like seeing posts of others, some great stuff out there!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before?  I bought this for my mother since she likes Castle.  She really seemed to enjoy the series, and agreed to watch Serenity too.  Haven't been able to interest her in Battledrama Galactica, though.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|After you read the book and watch the movie or the BBC production with Colin Firth in &#34;clingy pants&#34;, you'll really like this DVD. While some of the story is a little different, it doesn't matter. You'll watch Amanda from the 21st century trade with Lizzy and  try to make things follow the book. She always seems to know what should happen, but can never make it happen. Mr. Collins is very creepy while Wickham is actually somewhat decent. Surprises around every corner.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have always loved this game at the fair!  You drop coins to push coins and prizes forward. The higher levels you reach and the more prizes you collect, the more fun it gets. I have never purchased coins, just go out and let them store up!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|One of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, this generations Bring it On! Can watch it over and over again and laugh every time!
B001DDBCUA|3.0|Loved the package, delivery and service were excellent and on time and the parcel was delivered in perfect conditions. The problem is that the specific zone of the DVD's werent specified anywhere and I cant watch them in my DVD player, only in a computer I purchased in the USA.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I tryuly could not put this book down! Is Amy amazing?  Absolutely! I am still amzed by her efforts. What a great way to spend my winter break, a little love, murder and mystery.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|My family love the franchise, and this one is a great one that we've watched multiple times. I have recommended to friends and co-workers.
B000UU4NE4|3.0|This movie is WAY better than the latest spider man movie released. My two and a half year old son loves the &#34;sand monster&#34;. The plot is barely barable, much like my spelling.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I am not particularly interested in science fiction, so this book was a complete surprise.  It was reminescent of Carl Sagan's &#34;Contact&#34; from many years ago in that the circumstances and language were totally believable to us non-scientists.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I finished this book in 2 days! I could not put it down. Just enough magic, mystery, and romance to form the perfect novel.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is fun however it seems to be the hardest of the angry birds.  I get 3 stars on all the others and I have a difficult time getting 1 star on some of them
B00005JKG7|5.0|Very good quality, received quickly and in perfect condition. This is a classic scary movie and is loved on a multi generational level. Highly recommend.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|One of my favorite songs is Somewhere over the Rainbow and the way that Isreal sings it is awesume and the rest of the cd is interesting
6305692572|5.0|One of the all time great drama/love stories. Received it very quickly and in perfect condition. Love this movie, and would recommend to anyone.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Wonderful app with accurate aircraft, weapons and flight characteristics. A whole lot of work went into this and I'm enjoying it.<br /><br />This app made it to the front screen!<br /><br />Bravo Third Wire.
0062215507|5.0|my 12 year old was screaming at times when she found all the special gifts in the book.  she wants an exception letter so bad in her name
B009VB7P6G|5.0|i think this is the first movie my 3 year old daughter actually sat through and watched through beginning till end. and now she always wants to watch it. i think i have to buy the movie.
B009KHCRVO|5.0|My kids and I have fun watching really bad movies.  This one is a really good Bad movie.  It is hysterically bad.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movies -  this might not be for you.<br />If you want to watch a good Bad movie -- get the popcorn ready!
B0098VYKSA|4.0|this movie definatly put a twist on the story, not sure what to say, rent it and see if you like it
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I think the target audience is too young for the teenager storyline. My 4yo lives these movies normally, but not this one.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|i really am not sure what to say about this move.. it was funny -p love michelle and johnny in it.
B008476HBM|5.0|I downloaded this as my first book on my new Kindle.  Classic Austen, good font for the Kindle, phenomenal story line.  If you love romance and haven't read this quintessential book - what are you waiting for?
B004DM0UII|4.0|I thought this is a pretty neat radio app.  It looks nice and sounds good on my galaxy s3. Thanks! :)
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS RECOMMENDED BY A FRIEND.  HOWEVER IT WAS A LITTLE TOO VIOLENT FOR OUR TASTES, BUT WELL MADE.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|This has to solidify one fact. If you absolutely HAVE to guarantee that a movie that almost certainly should have been a box office smash instead be yet another bomb......hire Colin Farrell as the lead actor. Talk about box office poison!! Why on earth do people keep hiring this guy? He is a passable actor, looks ok.....just something about the guy guarantees that whatever he is in loses more money than anyone could ever imagine!<br />Incredible....I can't really figure it out. Yes, the movie was a very poor remake but still, it should have at LEAST broken even at the box office just from viewer curiosity over a remake of Arnolds GREAT original version....but true to form....Colin does it again. Colin Farrell truly is a \\"one of a kind\\" actor the likes of which I have never seen before!<br />The guy must have sex tapes hidden away featuring every movie companies CEO and their mistress.....how he keeps working in the film industry is a mystery beyond comprehension. When on earth are the financers of films going to realize that Farrell ALWAYS guarantees a vast loss of money?? The guy should be driving a taxi, not acting...anything but acting!!<br />The movie itself is poorly done, listlessly acted, poorly shot....just an incredibly lame remake of a truly great movie. Not even worth a cheap rental!
B004T0XYM8|4.0|I don't write reviews of acting, or my opinions about the significance of the film but I saw the new film Django the other night and the influences were so apparent that I had to then get a new copy of Once Upon a Time in the West on Blu Ray to replace my standard def copy.  Thus, this review will only be about the quality of the disc itself.<br /><br />The BluRay disc has both the theatrical release and the restored release.  Both versions come in with the same time duration.  I watched the restored version whose video is characterized by a fairly clean palate.  There remains some small amounts of grain, especially in the early scenes and some of the grain did crawl but that disappeared pretty quick.  The coloration of the restoration is really very good with excellent skin tones all around.  While Bronson, Fonda and many others are deeply tanned, and as in some of the included extras state 'heavily made up', you can see the paleness of both the boy and his sister's skin tones in contrast with the darker toning of Fonda.  The video restoration is really quite good, however, there is not a major difference that I could see when I then went back to the theatrical version which also looked good.  In the restored version I saw no ghosting or artifacts of any kind other than that crawling grain I mentioned early in the film.  There were good details in the dark areas and shadows.<br /><br />The audio is DTS HD 5.1 and while the wonderful sound track is nicely spread across the front stage, do not expect any real use of your discreet front or rear channels and almost nothing for your LFE sub channel to do but sleep.  This was a disappointment to me as audio has always been of importance to me and if they spend so much time and money on video restoration, you'd think they would do the same for the audio.  There is an early scene where the train literally goes over the camera coming at the viewer.  The audio should have passed from the front stage through the rear stage but doesn't.  Many other scenes where audio directionality should have been present were not, and the audio  stays on the front stage with little to no panning of any kind.  On the positive side, the uncompressed audio is beautifully clean and clear with levels properly set.  The lack of directionality is the only reason I downgraded the BluRay to 4 stars from 5.<br /><br />Never the less, the BluRay as an entirety is worthy because the movie itself is such a classic. Then again, I only paid $5.00 for it at the Walmart discounted bin.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thankst doesn't.

0553801473|5.0|Excellent story. The sex and language is in line with the story and not overdone at all. Can't wait for next book just hope it is not another 6 yrs.
B004H4XLRE|5.0|I don't know how this will stand up over time, but our 6 year old grandson had lots of fun with this at our house.  It races most any cars that will fit into it, not just the Cars cars.
0345529057|5.0|Ist three books I could not put down. It is obvious that he struggled with writing Feast for Crows but it was still good. A Dance with Dragons is better. Hope the next book is like the first three though
0143058525|3.0|It was okay.  Story itself was too broken up.  The character's were confusing.  The landscape was beautiful.  Just wasn't a story I could get into.
0316228532|2.0|I was disappointedwith this book. Maybe I expected the brilliance of the Harry Potter books but this was very dark. Full of filthy language and not one likeable character. But it is well written and that is only reason I will finish this.
0920668372|5.0|my grandchildern love the book I would recommend it for every household promotes  family values and understanding of childern and parents and grandparents.
B0077EBWVI|2.0|No where near the original, and it gets confused throughout the movie - from playing modern hip hop in their cars and new country pop in the bar, to having a 1st gen ipod and everyone talking about cell phones but only showing the old rotary dial landlines of the 80's, to them breaking out a tape deck to play the 'music they aren't supposed to listen to'. In effect, I didn't know if it was a failed attempt at imitating the kitsch of \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\", or if they really were just too lazy to decide if it was the 80's or modern day. I suspect the former, but who knows...<br /><br />The movie does have it's moments though...in all 10min of actual dancing, and in one line that came out right...<br /><br />\\"Play fair, punk!\\" made me laugh out loud, and the choreography at the end is great. The rest of the movie is better suited to entertain small children...that is, if you don't mind your kids looking up to a swearing, disrespectful ballerina.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game if you are looking for something to keep you occupied :) great graphics. The only downfall is you can't rotate buildings or objects.
B0038P59A0|3.0|The movie is stated as a Blu-Ray disc. Do not go by the product pictures. There are pictures that state it is a DVD/Blu-Ray/Digital copy version. IT IS NOT. Amazon does not sell the combo pack. Read the description notes before you buy.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Beautifully done and a true masterpiece. You can tell the work that they put in to transform this Film into an amazing journey. Joaquin will make you think your seeing Johnny Cash from the first time he says &#34;hello, am Johnny Cash&#34; Then you find out they both did there own singing. You will see and understand why Reese Witherspoon won the Academy Award for best Actress. Why Reese is one of the Top Actresses of Modern Hollywood and America's sweetheart. This is a movie everyone should own and everyone should see and then everyone should go and listen to Johnny Cash
B009JBWOU0|4.0|phenomenal films, delivered in great condition and in timely fashion, just wish there were more special features within the dvds, but that has nothing to do with amazon.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Bought this movie as a gift for a Johhny Depp fan. I saw it when it was in theaters<br />& thoroughly enjoyed it. Depp & Bonham Carter are great together, as usual.<br />Not for the squeamish! !
B00004TJK2|5.0|Very interesting story line - very different - enjoyed it a lot!  Will watch again and will recommend to others.
B005H29GSI|5.0|We help him build the structures, but it's his current favorite toy. I would recommend it!  Older kids should be able to build themselves.
B00005N6KG|5.0|They work great for me.  Also like the gel ones, but the ones that are circle that hang down hurt my ears..
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|Good CGI and lots of action with solid acting by a good cast.  I will say that there is less on the story than the original due to all the action.  Overall still a good movie.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book provided great insights into some of the most common health issues our society are having today especially in developed worlds. The author is spot on in pointing out that we should focus more on changing our diets as a preventarive measure which will significantly<br />reduce our health care costs.

B009186JYI|5.0|To  begin the photography was stunning.  I love the black and white filming with the very artful and beautiful compositions that were made by the photographer, who showed the Stones  off at their most beautiful.  Very stylish.  It was really fun to listen to them jamming together especially interspersed between interviews.  In particular, I loved Keith  singing \\"Santa bring my baby back to me;\\"  He sounded exactly like Elvis.  Unfortunately, Mick stuck his face in after only a few seconds and it was bye, bye Keith.  \\"Satisfaction,\\"really rocks.<br /><br /> I never realized how much Keith resembled an urchin out of a Charles Dicken's novel.  The interviews with Brian revealed him to be fragile in my estimation and foreshadowed what was to come.  Charlie was charming as was Bill.<br /><br />The media questions were so insipid as in, \\"Why is your hair long?\\" Nothing has changed in that Department.  As the boys walked off at the end, Bill Wyman stuck his tongue out at the camera which was sort of a buzz kill.  All in all, I watched it six times during my first sitting so it was mostly great fun.<br /><br />For a movie titled, \\"Charlie is My Darling,\\" it is interesting that no one has less screen time than Charlie.  I was also annoyed when Keith started to sing, \\"Santa Bring my Baby Back to Me,\\" and after only a few seconds the camera went to Mick's face. I sometimes get annoyed by having to overdose on Mick.  He's not alone up there but you'd never know it.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Definitely a page turner. I was immediately looking for the sequel. Everyone should read this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book epitomizes what young love should include. It wasn't overly sexual or crude and it leaves you with a bittersweet appreciation of not only the book but life itself. In the end any emptiness or dissatisfaction you acquired is replaced with completeness and confidence in the functioning of our characters and ourselves.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is a great game I love to play it and also passes the time when you are in a boring car ride

1439102813|4.0|This had the potential to be one of those books that brings me to tears and at a few times I really felt it... Genova took a heart breaking and emotion topic and put it into a story that really opens the readers eyes to Alzheimer's disease... I think that it was missing a little something...I'm not exactly sure what... but overall, a pretty great book. I will recommend it to friends and family.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It makes you feel great about yourself after you get done reading. I am reading this book twice!!! I love it
B0099TJ4YQ|5.0|It was a smooth beautiful album. Making the holiday a little nicer. I would recommed this holiday album to friends and family.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This app is really useful as a calculator.  For calculations that are more complex than 2+2=4, I find that it's significantly faster to write the terms than to type them into a scientific calculator.  More importantly, it's stunning that the handwriting recognition is so flawlessly good, accurately translating both numbers and mathematical operators.  I expected the app to get it right \\"most\\" of the time, but it has correctly translated everything I've written.  My new favorite calculator for my Android devices.
030759565X|5.0|Deb has written a great cookbook...easy to follow, enjoyable stories about her cooking and recipes anyone who loves to cook can easily master.  I tried her flat chicken and potatoes the day after I received this book and it was easy and a huge success with my family.  I look forward to further exploring more culinary delights.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I heard the author interview on NPR December 20, 2012 and immediately ordered the Kindle version.  WOW - am I ever glad I did!  It gave me a whole new perspective on the WWII German airmen.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Here's the lowdown: (a) I liked this movie a lot, (b) liked it better than even The Bourne Identity, which was the only moderately likeable movie in the first trilogy anyway, and (c) thought that it was much more in the spirit, if not in the plotline of Ludlum's books.<br />Here's a bit of rationale for these statements.<br />First of all I actually read the original novels, and the Jason Bourne of the original trilogy of movies had little to do, except for general plot-points and miscellaneous McGuffins with Ludlum's. The novels were completely perverted in the scripts when they killed off Marie in The Bourne Supremacy. She was such an integral part of the life of the Jason Bourne character of the novels that I was totally flabbergasted at the screw-ups with the scripts.<br />Then there were Matt Damon and Franka Potente, neither of whom came even close to being the Jason and Marie of the novels. Nothing against Damon and Potente per se; they just didn't fit. Period.<br />And then came Jeremy Brenner and Rachel Weisz and it was like \\"WOW! They did something right for once.\\" Maybe the plots weren't even close to anything Ludlum, but the characters certainly were much, much more like the Jason and Marie I recall from the novels. And characters are, after all, at the heart of everything.<br />Plus, of course, the awfully pretentious and thoroughly nauseating Greengrass cinematography was gone, and so we ended up with a truly enjoyable flick.<br />And, no, I definitely do NOT want to see a movie where Damon joins Brenner. In fact, here's a chance to pick some storyline from the original novels and let Brenner and Weisz run with it. And keep her alive for goodness' sake!
1469203820|5.0|The story is easy to follow and works well as an audiobook.  The speaker is easy to understand and the various characters are easy to differentiate.  This is a very good book to listen to while driving.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I remember Rod as a big hit when I was in High School he was the bomb back then! When I purchased this I wasn't sure what to expect. It was great, enjoyed his music on Christmas Eve and Rod did not disappoint. Great music added a lot of spirit to the holidays!
B000063Y8F|5.0|This is a beautiful bit of engineering. Solid and stately. Works great. Cleaning is easy after you press the garlic. I've made gifts of these several times and everybody loves them.
B0053O89XI|5.0|I love watching the Big Bang Theory.  This show is very funny and the actors are great playing their characters.
B00A9X9VAI|3.0|This time travel movie left so many questions but not about the puzzles of time travel.  It was just poorly written and much of t he major story line was unexplored.  Googling for explanation revealed that the writer/director did not know the answers either.  Not really worth the time or the money.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|I ordered this box just befor Christmas, as a present to myself. I live in Monterrey, Mexico, so it made more sense to get the US version for both economic and practical reasons, and with Amazon's Global Shipping the box arrived in just two days, just like they promised!!<br /><br />I had read many reviews, both positive and negative, and I thought about it a lot before deciding to buy this incredible Box.<br /><br />Maybe I am lucky, but I was not dissapointed in any way with this Box!!<br /><br />I began listening to every album in chronological order, slowly, sometimes listening to one album a day, sometimes two. I just finished listening to all of the albums today!!<br /><br />Fortunately, not one of the records in the box have any of the problems mentioned in some of the reviews, nor do they have any problems at all!!<br /><br />These problems other people wrote about include, warped records, records with \\"skips\\" in them, and records pressed off-center, and noise.<br /><br />The records in my box are all perfect and it has been an absolute delight listening to these gems again!!<br /><br />The remastered sound is incredible!! I really did feel like the Beatles were playing in my room! The records have a warmth in the sound that is just not present on the CD Boxes (I have both the Mono and Stereo Remastered Cd's).<br /><br />I have a recent UK vinyl pressing of \\"Abbey Road\\" that was pressed from a Direct Metal Master, or so it says on the back of the record jacket. I listened to this copy of \\"Abbey Road\\" after listening to the \\"Abbey Road\\" album from the Box, and I must say, while both sound great, the copy from the Box sounds even warmer!!<br /><br />The packaging on each album is amazing!! All the albums are issued with the original labels used at the time of their original UK release, and in the case of the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" album, the original Capitol \\"rainbow\\" label (I am assuming it is the original because my old MMT vinyl record is from the late 70's and it has an Apple label, a green one, like many 70's US Beatles albums have.).<br /><br />The pre- Apple albums have white inner sleeves and from the White Album onwards, they have black inner sleeves, except for Disc One of the \\"Past Masters\\" album, which has a white inner sleeve.<br /><br />The White Album is made so the records are removed from the sides rather than from the top as in the original album's first pressings, and the covers are not numbered, but I don't think that diminishes this Box Set in any way!!<br /><br />The double album \\"Past Masters\\" has the Yellow and Black Parlaphone labels on Sides 1 and 2 and the green Apple labels on Sides 3 and 4. I think that is very very cool!!<br /><br />In regard to the book included with the Box, I cannot give it enough praise!! It is simply BEAUTIFUL!! Very lavishly produced and printed, not unlike the first hard-back edition of the \\"Anthology\\" Book.<br /><br />As for the way the box was packaged, I could not have been more pleased, and I have written positive feedback for the packaging, specifically, as well. The box arrived packed in a large and sturdy cardboard box. There were foam inserts placed in a way that the box itself did not move within the shipping box at all.<br /><br />I read reviews where people wrote that the shipping box was too big for the Box and that caused it to move, and be damaged during shipping, but that was not the case with me.<br /><br />The Box arrived in absolutely PERFECT condition, without any dings or dents on the box itself or the record sleeves.<br /><br />I listened to these albums on a Teac GF 650 Record Player that I purchased from Amazon. It may not be an \\"audiophile\\" level player, but it suits me just fine and the Beatles records sound great on it!<br /><br />I use it to play my most recent vinyl purchases, such as the various Paul McCartney Archive Collection albums issued so far, the Beatles 1 Vinyl LP, and the Beatles Anthology albums on vinyl. All of them sound great!!<br /><br />There are record stores in Monterrey that sell the Box, but Amazon had a much better price, and even with the Two-Day International Shipping (the cost of which was not too bad considering what I ordered and less than the purchase price, which is not always the case), it cost me much less than I would have paid at the stores in Monterrey.<br /><br />I have no doubt that there have been serious quality control issues with the U.S. version of The Beatles Stereo Vinyl Box Set, but I also think there must be many Boxes out there without those issues. Hopefully, EMI will take notice of them and resolve them, and make sure these issues do not affect the Mono Vinyl Box.<br /><br />I think this Box is worth buying, and I cannot wait for the Mono Vinyl Box.<br /><br />I give this Box a 5 Star rating, and if it were a Concert, I would also give it a Standing Ovation!!!!<br /><br />There are record stores in Monterrey that sell the Box, but Amazon had a much better price, and even with the Two-Day International Shipping (the cost of which was not too bad considering what I ordered and less than the purchase price, which is not always the case), it cost me much less than I would have paid at the stores in Monterrey.<br /><br />I have no doubt that there have been serious quality control issues with the U.S. version of The Beatles Stereo Vinyl Box Set, but I also think there must be many Boxes out there without those issues.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've devoured all of John Grisham's books (those aimed at adults) and was glad to have a new one. It was refreshing; not as preachy as some of his recent books. Just a fun ride. I didn't want it to end and I hope he writes more using the central character. I could definitely envision a sequel!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am so glad I took a chance on this game because this is awesome. It wasn't as expensive as some of the other games that I bought (which were lame). I will be buying the next on. The graphics are very well done.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have seen on the news all the hoopla over this book being written.  I don't believe it discloses any secrets, it appears to state the facts and offers insight into what is going to be a great piece of history.  I understand their are certian code of ethics that are unwritten, but I appreciate this book being written so the rest of us can learn what these elite fighters go through and encounter every day.
B009M588K8|1.0|Total pile of egotistical drivel - full of filler about how macho this self-absorbed egotistical main character is....no substance, no plot....nothing more than an \\"all about me\\" book - I can't believe I read this pile of junk....if you buy it...get the paperback edition so you can tear the pages out and use them for something more appropriate given the content - perhaps lining a bird cage or stuffing into a pair of wet shoes - but then, those wet shoes would smell even worse.....one of the worst books ever published - total garbage
B000JMKSE2|4.0|If you want to understand Amazon, Netflix and iTunes...This is the book for you.  Well researched and written in such a way that you do not loose interest. Engaging
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was a very frustrating read. The story line was weak and frankly, unbelievable. I wanted more and it failed to deliver,  chapter after chapter. I read it to the end because of the hype and because it was a Christmas gift. The repetitiveness had me \\"rolling my eyes\\" and I was screaming for a change of scenery and a change of pace. The writing was amateurish at times. The gratuitous sex does not carry this book, for me. Maybe I'm missing the point, or perhaps I'm jaded. Maybe the story goes deeper in the rest of the books in the trilogy. But unless I get a sudden panic attack in the middle of the night to know what ultimately happens with Ana, I will not read them.
B007O3QC8K|3.0|The first three movements,  sad to say,  are not up to the quality of the best. Barenboim, Karajan, Lopez-Cobos and even Dudamel and the Gothenburg Symphony in different ways capture the grandeur and spirituality of this incomplete work.  The first movement moves fast and loud,  the scherzo is martial and forceful,  but the great adagio is strangely empty.  It is played too fast and the conductor seems to go out of his way to tell us this is not the ending anymore. It is only on the wonderful version of the finale constructed by four different composers out of Bruckner's numbered sketches and incomplete orchestration that Rattle and the Berliners come alive.  It's as if Sir Simon were waiting to spring the Finale on us and just going through the motions on the other three movements.  The new coda is terrific and a fitting ending to this great symphony.<br />Even if the first three movements are not up to par,  the finale gave me an inkling of what we lost when this man died without completing this symphony.  This recording is still worth it just for that Finale.

0525953728|1.0|I bought this trash book when it came out thinking I was going to read an account about the work and efforts that led up to the Osama Bin Laden raid...but instead this is more about how macho and self absorbed the main character is - and it really amounts to nothing more than an ego-fest. There is no strategy, no mention or nod to the intelligence that led up to finding Bin Laden - no...just garbage about how much this jerk loves guns and how tough he is....I regret buying this piece of scat and don't think I could qualify the words on these pages as any form of literature - the ingredients on a bottle of water have more depth and substance than this ridiculous egotistical pile of drivel...one of the worst reads I've ever seen - pure garbage

B0076DCT2G|1.0|There is one key plot point in the book surrounded by hundreds of pages of overwritten, under thought dialogue and non-action.

This is a great read for woman of all ages, though teens and younger may not fully appreciate it.  It made me feel normal.  I read it twice, then passed it on to my mom, who loved it just as much.  She gave it to her friend to read afterward.  Who knows who has it by now, but I thinks that speaks to what a great book it is that we women keep giving it to others to share!

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I am an avid reader, and typically like to challenge myself.  When I am busy, or don't feel like concentrating as hard on what I am reading, I like to read Emily Giffin's books.  They are nice to read and always have happy, harmonious endings - a nice break from the typical sci-fi and post-Apocalypse books that I often read.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|You will be drawn into this in-depth look at people and personalities, including four rivals,  in President Lincoln's cabinet. It is not a biography although it contains details about the four men's and Lincoln's earlier years leading up to the election and the post-election periods. The book concentrates on the mechanics of 1860 campaigning, government and governance.<br /><br />President Obama cited it as one of his favorite books, and you can see why. Democrat or Republican, if your interests include politics or history, you'll be fascinated by this exhaustively researched and readable account of President Lincoln and the people surrounding him.

0062127241|5.0|As a long time fan of the Who, I have read several books, including bios on Keith Moon, Maximum R&B, and various other books that included tales of the Who.  I received this over Christmas break and once started, could not put it down.  I finished this book in two days, and loved every page of it.  A very honest account from Pete, with no excuses on his personal issues and demons, as well some insight into battles with alcoholism and addiction.<br /><br />A great read for any music fans, and keen insight into the creation of various songs and albums.  I was sad to have reached the end, and honestly wish that the book would go on.  A compulsive read that is impossible to put down.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Awesome show! Great plot and character developement. It is a great contemporary remake of an old classic. And you gotta love the yummy british accent.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|Kiss of Steel is a fresh and thrilling romance set in a wonderfully alternative Victorian London.  There's enough similarity with the language and culture of the London of Oliver Twist that the reader doesn't have to work too hard, and delicious hints of the alternate world are sprinkled through the pages like currants in a scone.  The story begins with a bang and never lets up.<br /><br />When Honoria Todd's father is murdered, she loses her social and financial positions and becomes the sole support of her brother Charlie and sister Lena. She's reduced to giving elocution lessons to young ladies, but even that job is precarious because of a Big Secret in Honoria's past.  All is not well with Charlie, and there's definitely a seedy side to this London.  When Honoria is summoned for a meeting with Blade, the Devil of Whitechapel, she is prepared for the worst.  She's right, but not in the way she suspects.  Is Blade really the Bill Sykes-ish ruffian he'd like her to think; is he in league with her Nemesis, Vickers? Or is there another, more refined side to Blade?  As we find out the answers to the questions, rhere's a decaying aristocracy called the bluebloods, the existence of a kind of vampiric plague and some absolutely delightful steampunk elements that add considerably to the plot.  I especially liked the image conjured up by Ms. McMasters' almost offhand references to a mechanical Trojan Horse used for crowd control. It takes a deft hand to not overload the reader with information, and Ms. McMaster doles out tidbits only as necessary. There's no info dumping and no extensive backstory until the reader is ready for it.<br /><br />Most novels categorized as steampunk suffer from one of two problems.  Either the book lacks a delicate enough touch with the technology and the story can't hold up to the world-building, or the steampunk elements seem to be added as an afterthought and the story could be told perfectly well without them.  It's difficult to strike the necessary balance between technology and emotion to tell a compelling steampunk romance. Kiss of Steel absolutely hits it out of the park.  Family and romantic relationships drive this story with just enough technololgical detail to anchor it in this alternative universe.  It's exciting and suspenseful and makes total sense.  There's no higher praise for a book in one of the riskier genres (scifi, urban fantasy, paranormal and steampunk).necessary balance between technology and emotion to tell a compelling steampunk romance.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|The first for books were amazing.<br />This one started off great.  But unless<br />there is to be a sixth in the series, you'll<br />be left hanging.<br />No mention of what happened to the main family<br />characters except for those passed on.<br />No mention of how or if their home was reclaimed.<br />No mention if they lived happily ever after or not.<br />Left hanging.  I want to know the end.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|I can't tell you how many times my being introspective rather than verbose has brought criticism in my interactions. On the other hand I have also had rewarding experiences being &#34;the&#34; listener. Haven't finished the book. Still reading.

B0098VXBIA|4.0|The movie was very heartfelt and touching. The funniest parts were the men and how they felt about everything. It is definitely a movie for women though it is definitely something women can relate too and understand.

0547258305|4.0|This was a pretty great book. I loved the idea of the Graces and how unpredictable and ever changing they could be. Thumbs up to Cashore for her creativity. I also love the fact that this book has such a strong heroine. I love heroines! Although i have to admit that at times in this book, i wanted to knock some sense into katsa for being uptight and kind of clueless(although i can totally understand why). But more to the point i liked her character, and also the way that she and Po meshed. Awesome sauce. Im getting ready to read Bitterblue(skipping Fire for now) and i would LOVE to see more about Katsa n Po in the future.
0544045203|4.0|I had no idea what this book was about other than a boy and a tiger on a lifeboat.  How did they get there?  How did they survive? Can this really be true or is it science fiction?  I have to say this book surprised me.  It is about faith, despair, love, religion and the spiri of both man and beast to survive. The descriptions and details to both the sea and the boat were amazing.  This is much more than the &#34;Old man and the sea&#34; because of a tiger named of all things Richard Carter. It is one thing to survive alone but quite another to help a 400 lb cat to survive as well. What these two &#34;animals&#34; have to do may turn your stomach but I for one do not what I would eat or drink in order stay alive.  We never know until we are thrown into a situation of life or death. It is the boy and the tiger bound together in both fear and hope that give this story the basis for one exciting read.  I know I will see the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting its one that u can play and not notice 20 min going by
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|Tom has to get the readers going from the beginning of the book to hold their attention for the rest of it.  This book starts out so so slow that I almost sent it back.  But 2/3 it start to get hold and has some great twists and turns to bring the reader back again to the story.  He has to get back to his old writing style.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I purchased the Hunger Games Trilogy for my Kindle.  I loved the trilogy.  The kindle is easy to use.  I can order books on my kindle quickly.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm not going to tell what this book was about, nay, that would a waste of space. I'm not going go tell you the deeper meaning or what the author \\"was really trying to say.\\" I believe there is no greater insult to a work then that. However, in my few years of being about to devour books as I do, never have I ever come across a book that speaks both of and to the human soul.<br /><br />Green wrote of a forever created within the limits of reality, the impossible time that never exists. Let me tell you in simple words, this book is my forever, as pretentious as that may sound. Take his words to heart and if by perchance you are lucky someday they will reach your soul.
B0091REZMW|1.0|unloaded after playing short time. good thing it was free...i am not sure it was even worth that. words were so small you couldn't read them. i have 8.9 screen.

B00A9X9TIW|4.0|It starts off a little odd but gets better as it moves along. The ending warranted the 4 star rating.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I can't pick one that's better then any other, cause I Love all of them. I wish at certain times in the movie though that it went on a little longer instead of going through the story. But there's fun new characters brought into this one and it has a nice ending that keeps it open for more Toy Stories.
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|It's a cute movie and I got a kick out of it, although I don't think it's one of Disney's best in this genre.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|It works awesomely! I am always worried about losing my pics and videos and now I have back up. It was delivered at the speed of light as well. Thank you, Annette

B009GCF3Q4|3.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting, but these are not Harry Bosch short stories. they can be a bit disjointed on a kindle.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|Like most of my generation, I saw the animated movie before every hearing about the book. I adored it, honestly. I'm fully considering finding and buying a hard back to keep as bedtime story stock.<br /><br />For those of you here in search of a more detailed version of the movie, you're in for a bittersweet disappointment. I found the real story more interesting, more satisfying than the movie.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This book is a great read and you will be falling over from laughter. I would recommend this book if you enjoy a good laugh!
B005R32L66|4.0|drop calls from time to time. works just like any house phone. and you can have your own number. Nice
B003TSEEDY|5.0|After finishing the book, I am left wanting a sequel. Much better than the movie. A great read that is hard to walk away from.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a Marine Corps veteran and a beginner reader. This book was very easy to comprehend and I found myself unable to put the book down. I enjoyed the content of the book because I was able to relate to the author, Mark. I believe we were actually in theater at the same time in 2005.<br />I would recommend this read to any American, the true story needs to be told.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun and addictive.  And fast.  I play it when I'm stuck somewhere and need to burn off time.  It makes time fly.
B007WFTFG6|5.0|...my 2 1/2 yr old grandson figured out how to navigate this easily and showed me how to make the coloring line thinner or thicker. For $3, you can unlock the full program but we've had no need to do that so far.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|I love every song on this album.  It is often on repeat in my car.  I don't think I have ever found an album where I legitimately liked every song on it, but Katy Perry: Teenage Dream managed to do that.
0307463745|5.0|This is a very good read for any person who owns a business or wants to start one.  There are lot of various lessons in this book laid out in very short and concise form (3 to 4 page chapters).  Some of the advice I didn't agree with me but I found myself nodding \\"yes\\" to a lot of chapters.  I read this a few months and I still am thinking about some of the information in here (best advice: decisions are progress).  It's a good, quick read that will improve your business.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I've told my friends about this game and they love it too.  One of them has a contest with her husband. It's fun and easy to understand.

B0036S4C6G|4.0|Well written but somewhat chaotic in its leaps through time and people. Not to be read over a lo period of time because you can easily lose track of characters and decades. Fun, playful and easy to relate to, even for those not musically inclined or knowledgeable.

B003QSOFFO|5.0|Thoughts:<br /><br />Who hasn't seen Pocahontas? Okay, so it's not going to be historically accurate but I love that it demonstrates the importance of nature and caring for &#34;Mother Earth&#34;. It's a great story!
0547848412|5.0|This novel, like most fantastical tales, lures the reader into its premise by first presenting a fairly reasonable, if exotic, setting and premise. A boy grows up in Pondicherry, an Indian city, in the 1970's. His father runs a zoo and much of the first portion of the novel explains the operations and rationale of the zoo along with detailed descriptions of its inhabitants and how this `artificial' environment is customized to meet their natural needs, probably the most extensive and thorough explanation of a zoo I have encountered. If Yann Martel's information is not completely authoritative it certainly contains the tone of authenticity.<br /><br />As Pi enters adolescence, he begins a spiritual quest and finds enough truth in Hinduism, Christianity and Islam to say that he believes all three of them and sees no contradiction in them, despite the strong objections of his father and clergy from each of those religions insisting that he must choose one and discard the others.<br /><br />Pi's undergoes a radical change after his father sells the zoo when the family boards a Japanese cargo ship headed for Canada with animals in tow with the intent to sell them once they reach their destination. For reasons never fully explained, in the middle of the night the ship begins sinking during a storm. In the middle of the chaos, Pi, exploring the deck of the ship just before hearing what he thinks is an explosion, loses track of his family, leaves the ship and climbs into a lifeboat, accompanied by four animals--a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger, given the name Richard Parker due to a clerical error in transferring ownership from his hunter. Within a short time, Pi and Richard Parker will be the only animals left alive on the boat.<br /><br />The bulk of the novel deals with Pi's struggle for survival against the elements, finding food and preventing himself from becoming Richard Parker's next meal. Pi exists in an intensely heightened stateof awareness, suspended between terror of being devoured by Richard Parker or some other unknown threat and wonder at the beauty of this ocean world. Each day he employs all of his wits and reason in a struggle to survive. He finds that the smallest object might become, when seen in another context, the most important thing in the world, the thing that will save his life.<br /><br />The novel includes beautiful passages in which Pi perceives vast underwater highways of sea traffic and compares the experience to the difference between passing scenery in an automobile with walking past the scenery on foot. He learns to recognize the changing complexion of the sky as well as the varying composition of the sea. He has a Proustian experience when the smell of hand-flare shells reminds him of the smell of cumin and sends him into a vivid recollection of Pondicherry in which the entire town comes to life again. His perceptual awareness reaches almost hallucinogenic heights.<br /><br />He never tames Richard Parker although he does evolve an arrangement for co-existence between them in which both can stay on their own turf. Pi catches fish as much to keep Richard Parker fed and render him less of a threat as to keep himself alive. After several months of starvation and steadily increasing weakness for both of them, Pi experiences the most fantastic portion of his tale as the lifeboat reaches a small island inhabited only by meerkats, trees, an algae-like substance and freshwater ponds full of dead fish. He quickly discovers that the island is a self-contained, self-devouring and sustaining floating organism and that if he stays, although he is relatively safe and able to live off the water and vegetation and replenish his body, he will eventually be devoured as well. So he sets off in the lifeboat with Richard Parker until eventually reaching the coast of Mexico, where Richard Parker disappears from his life, walking off into the jungle, and Pi is finally found by fellow humans.<br /><br />The investigators of the sinking of the ship do not believe Pi's fanciful story. They must have something they can accept officially as a realistic explanation of how Pi survived. So Pi tells them a sordid tale of a sailor with a broken leg, a cook, his mother and himself in which he witnesses his mother's gruesome murder at the hands of the cook after the death of the sailor, kills the cook and floats in the raft for over 200 days until he reaches Mexico. The investigators must believe the second tale, seeing equivalents between the characters in it with the animals in the first tale. Pi asks which tale they like the best and they have to admit they prefer the tale with the tiger.<br /><br />At the end we are left with the same choice of what to tell ourselves that is the most meaningful explanation of what Pi experiences. Whether one accepts Pi's tale as myth or parable or epic poem, whether one believes that Pi traveled with a Bengal tiger or learned to use and tame the savage aspects of his own survival mechanism, what we have just read can certainly be seen as a vehicle for a profound transformation of Pi that enabled him to survive, evolve and learn to know who he really is.

B007EECSFA|4.0|this book was hard to put down once i started it.  in fact, when i finished it, i ordered another kate morton book.  the secret keeper, even there were many characters, they were easy to remember & the ending was not what i expected.  might even read it again - next year or so.  good book.

0394827996|3.0|Thoughts:<br />* I loved this book as child, whether one agrees with the material or not, as a child I was memorized by the images!<br />* I knew this book was a paperback but I didn't know it would be so flimsy, so that made me a little sad.<br />* It doesn't have any glitter or shimmer on the fish like my book did when I was kid.<br />* It's a fine book, just not what I was hoping for I guess!<br /><br /> A lovely read, at a great price. It's a paperback though, just FYI!
B001JIFYSA|4.0|I would recommend this movie if the viewer wants a relaxing and fun experience.  Bill Nighy and Hugh Grant play their typical characters and there is nothing wrong with that.

1589944607|5.0|This game is fantastic.  The rules are a little complex, but not too bad once you get the hang of it.  The game is basically a cooperative game where you try and overcome challenges being tossed out at you.  You make hard decisions argue over the best course of action, and soldier on.  The catch is that one or two of you is a Cylon and is actually working against the group.  What makes this game great is that if the Cylon player plays their cards right, they can go undetected for a long time, all the while really screwing their fellows who have deluded themselves into thinking that this time they didn't get a Cylon in the group.<br /><br />The game would be fun with the cooperative piece on its own.  The secret saboteur adds in an interesting social dynamic.  The game takes a little time to play, and you will need to refer to the rules on occasion, but overall this game is fantastic.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Thoughts:<br /><br />* If you haven't seen this movie, you need to watch it! It is adored by everyone I know and will restore that Christmas spirit into even the grouchiest of Grinchs! :)

B005V4FJC4|5.0|I heard one of these songs on a compilation album so listened to the samples on Amazon and decided to buy. There are some really cool, unique versions of songs I already knew and some new, originals too -- not the same old thing. I like the same old thing with the same old artists usually but if it's new, it needs to add something that makes it worth while. She & Him does that.

B00992CF6W|5.0|everyone terribly rates this because there are no &quot; monsters&quot; . yes there are.  the game automatically put you in creative mode. all you do is click to make a new world. a small button should say creative. click it to switch it!! happy spawning :)
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Thanx so much it's a great video and the gift was great for the kids who received it this year
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I've grew up with Phantom of the Opera when I saw the movie version when I was 11, and I saw Phantom 3 times. 2 in Vegas, and 1 in LA. I've always dreamed of being in the show, and as The Phantom. I felt a connection with him when I saw his disfigurement, and when he desires for his true love. This should be shown to all future musical theatre goers, and to future composers, actors, and actresses. This is THE show to see.
B005VPRET4|5.0|This was the second set I gave my granddaughter for Christmas and she was extremely excited over both sets.  Anything that gives her that much pleasure is a winner in my book.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I was expecting a lot more out of this book! It's obvious that the author got bored of writting and just wanted to end the series quickly. Personlly, I have been truly a disapointment. Of course I was'nt expecting a happily ever after...  The purpose of the series was defeated when Prim was killed. I was furious when this lousy excuse for the ending book basically cut away the whole purpose. I wish that Prim could have at least survived. Over all, this book is a long treacherous lousy read!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love Tina Fey.  She has such a wicked, feminine slant on humor.  This book did not disappoint! Hope she writes more.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|It will make a tremendous difference in your photos, especially portraits and still life shots.<br /><br />Love that it has the remote flash capability with the D90, which makes for some fun photo possibilities.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved this book! The great Grisham comes through loud and clear. Thoroughly riveting. It is a great read. Pure genius<br />,
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I've watched this show on Netflix, and when they expired it in October or September, I want to purchase this show to watch it again and again. I mainly love Ed O'Neill's performance as Al Bundy, and he is a great comedian.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game, keeps you occupied and it is fun and fast. I like the way the jewels continually fall, it helps you gain a big score. You don't want to stop, you want to continue. Hard to stop playing.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is a GREAT book...Loved the characters...I loved Travis!...I wished I was starting it all over for the first time...ENJOY!!!!
B009JZVT70|5.0|Great show! Can't stop watching. If you live magical shows this is one for you. And if you believe in true love thus is one for you!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Still captivating though darker than the others. There was only one way it could have ended and I believe Mrs. Collins got it right. 3 stars for the darkness.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another edge of your seat thriller. A few twists and enough action that you don't want to put it down!
B007DIQC90|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 17 year old daughter.  She likes all types of music and this is one of the bands that she likes.

B0000844M8|5.0|This movie was a \\"made for TV\\" movie broadcast in the mid-1960's. It touched my young heart then, and it still does today, despite the passing of many decades.  The story of Elsa the Lioness is truly a story of heartbreak, love, and inspiration.  Joy and George Adamson become the \\"parents\\" of three orphaned lion cubs.  They tenderly raise them to young adulthood and then send two away to a zoo, while Elsa remains with them.  Joy Adamson refused to send Elsa to a zoo and instead attempts to teach her how to live free in the wilds of Kenya, something that had never been done before.  Will Joy be able to let Elsa go, to live on her own?  Can Elsa learn to live wild and free again?  The answers await you in this heart-touching, lovely film.  You will cry tears of joy as you watch this story unfold and then conclude.  Suitable for family viewing, this is a wonderful film for the entire family to love and enjoy.  Most highly recommended. (Brief episodes of animal violence and one swear word).  It is rated PG.<br /><br />kone
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. One of those that makes you say \\"just one more game!\\" Solitare with a twist of being able to pick the difficulty level. A must have!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|As good as 50 shades and Gabriel's Inferno<br />A little more explicit but a very screwed up addicting love story
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Very addicative. Have gotten away from it for awhile but will probably be back after the Holidays.Someone mentioned Star wars. May try that.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|loved the price for this CD on this website, the music is classic beachboys but more becuase of new sounds they were trying/experimenting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I will never again tease my mom about all the soaps she watched when I was a kid. Sorry mom, I get it now.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was such a great story I didn; want it to end. Brilliant writting by a genius. I will read more of King.
1451695195|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this once it came. My husband also read right through it once I passed it along. Dr. Alexander makes this book interesting and personal. Easy read but very thought provoking.

B00AAX68HG|4.0|I have been playing this app about 3 hours now and I love it. The only way this app could get any better is if these ads didn't always pop up. I hats that but its all worth because this app is AMAZING
4893580914|5.0|For anyone interested in learning the basic Kanji in the Japanese language this book is a must accessory. The introduction is done step by step so as not get confused and to digest these letters with easiness.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this Book! I flew through the first book, and couldn't put this one down! Now I have to wait until June for the third book!
B005COO1X6|1.0|I still want to know what happened to the horse in the van and wish the story had been developed beyond whre it ended. It was too short for a Stephen King story. I wanted moore!
B008LV05EG|4.0|I had seen/heard of Rita, but hadnt heard any of her music. I had a good feeling about her, and after reading good reviews decided to take a chance...so glad I dd, I love this album...fun,fun,fun.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I started reading this book this morning, having just finished a very bad thriller and wanting to read something light and fun and frothy.  This sounded like just the thing - a quick mindless HQN read.<br /><br />But after an admittedly rocky start, this book just got better and better, and I really felt for these two characters once we started finding out why they were both behaving like such morons.  There were several times when I got legitimately choked up over the obstacles these two idiots (and I say that affectionately) were putting in their way.  They were very well-developed considering the brevity of the book.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more development of characters other than the hero and heroine, but within the limits of a HQN that's not really possible.  Which is, I guess, my ultimate point:  With a little more fleshing out of the secondary characters, and with the main plot slowed down a little so it could be savored, this book absolutely had the potential to be much more than a quick series read.  I will check out her other HQNs for sure, but I hope this author goes on to do longer, more involved non-series novels.  The ability to make me care that much about her characters isn't something I come across often.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This DVD is pretty amazing if you are a batman lover. You should buy this for those who love batman. The package is nice too.
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|A game of 16 cards!! for up to 4 players. Although it is so 'small' you can have a 'big' time with your friends. Recommended for your card game collection.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It is a unique, cleverly written story that keeps the reader's attention from the first page.  I enjoyed it thoroughly!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was definitely the best of the trilogy. After I read it I was not as enthusiastic about the other two. This was out of my usual realm of book choices.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|I would rate it higher but I have only managed to play through two times. Now it keeps freezing on me.<br />Edit: I have uninstalled and re installed and it seems to be playing. The sub menus (graphs) sometimes are blank. I will play it some more and see what happens. It is a fun game and good time waster.
B000TDDI7U|5.0|One of my favorite Duran albums.  Definitely, this album was a step in a new direction for the band.  Streamlined, down to three, tight, funky, new directions musically and vocally.  There are songs that should have been released like El Presidente and Hold Me.  Awesome album all the way through.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|This is one of those silly little games that is easy to get addicted to.  It makes you think about your moves before you make them, or your little piles of pudding slide right off the table, and no one ever wants that.  My kids, who seem to have been born with the ability to understand video and electronic games, have finished it.  I play it occasionally, but don't have the time they seem to, so I have not completed it, but I'm working on it.  I had no trouble downloading it, nor had any trouble in the game play.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Of course the movie was very Action packed. It was supposed to be thought provoking but it was pretty easy to figure out. didn't love characters.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This long story based on a true story will transport you to the medieval Japan. The book is a great tool to learn about the amazing samurai culture and Japan's relations with the western world. Highly recomended!!
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This was a good story that had a little intrigue to pique one's interest. I enjoyed reading it. I will read more Sparks' novels.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Excellent quality, design and the book should be sold separately coz like the LP's worth a lot.<br />They should've done ages ago!
B002SAUCBC|4.0|But not his best! This was a good book. The characters were believable, and the story line kept my attention. I thought the end felt a bit rushed. Kind of fizzled for me. If the ending would have been better, it would be a 5 star.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|So wonderfully written, I couldn't put it down. Speeds up in the second half and my heart was pounding! I LOVE this book. Cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Freed is everything I hoped it would be and more! Well paced reading, once again kept me reaching for my Kindle!
0689878451|5.0|Tango makes three arrived on time and in perfect condition.  It was both a cheap and awesome gift idea for my nephew!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent as always!  I've read all of his books and have yet to be disappointed with Mitch, Irene, Coleman, Nash or Dummand!
B005FISBTO|4.0|I suppose the absence of a family to hide his doings from made it less intense for me. But I still very much enjoyed the season.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|While this was an OK book, I dont get what all the hype was about. The story kind of went on....and on for me. I finished it out just to see the ending-which by the way, was mediocre. The scenes and dialogue were very redundant. I will not read the other two. While I would not really recommend this book-I think just about everyone has read it to see what the (or lack there of) fascination is all about.
B005LAII8A|5.0|I watched this movie very late at night, and so I was tired.  However, it woke me up and I couldn't bring myself to go to bed.  I was so intrigued and enjoyed every minute of this movie. I rented the movie, but would like to own it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|oh .. so sweet .. Hope Less !!<br />I love the title !<br />A good option for sweet stories with unespecteds ends.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I can't believe I had never even heard of this show until last year when I watched all the available seasons. I guess I don't watch much non fiction tv. I found it on Netflix and was hooked. The whole premise is hilarious because all we good guys have this internal desire to be badasses right?
B008QTVNUI|4.0|This has a lot of interesting ideas within it but there are also huge holes in the logic behind the story lines. I don't find any of the characters people I care for and it is very dark. I was given as a gift and I would probably not order the next season.
B000A59PMO|5.0|My favorite series ever. This show should never have been cancelled, they need a reunion movie! Worth watching even though there was only three seasons :(
B001BANK32|5.0|Unfortuantely I saw the movie first, but I think this is one of SKs finest. I can' wait for the sequel next year!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very enjoyable an and addicting. Makes you want to keep redoing each level until you make the three stars. My five year old even enjoys playing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it better on the Kindle than on my PC, it's easier to play. I could do without the Ad's that pop-up.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If I could give this 10 stars I would...I absolutely loved this movie!!  This is one you want to buy to keep in your collection!
0375831002|5.0|I was absolutely convinced that I would not like this book. I forced myself into reading it, resolved that at the end of the 550 (excruciating, I thought) pages, I'd breathe a sigh of relief, pat myself on the back for my accomplishment (because now I can at least say that I've read it), and move on with my life. Instead, it is nearly 2 in the morning, I've finally finished crying, and a heavy weight is sitting on my chest. And I can promise you - I am not usually melodramatic when it comes to books.<br /><br />The Book Thief was one of, if not the most, beautifully written books that I have ever read in my entire life.<br /><br />But I am getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />The Book Thief is the story of five Germans - a young girl named Liesel, her foster parents Rosa and Hans, a Jewish man named Max who they shelter, and Liesel's best friend Rudy - who live during Hitler's rise to power in Nazi Germany. Their story is told through the eyes of the omnipresent Death, who often interrupts the story to offer his own insights and opinions regarding the state of the world during that time period and commentary on the various characters and their doings. Death leads us through their stories, allowing us to witness the horrors of their struggles and yet revel in the beauty that they experience.<br /><br />This book was... amazing. I don't know how else to put it. I've read several titles that surround the events of the Holocaust and WWII (Number the Stars, Night, etc.) and while each have been powerful in its own way, The Book Thief was different. I read somewhere that the writing style is considered \\"experimental\\" - that is, Death often interrupts the main story line to give small anecdotes and his own personal opinions... which makes The Book Thief a rather slow read... but I don't mean boring or dry. I often found myself taking a half hour to devour ten pages because I didn't want to miss a single concept or idea.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say. The Book Thief was an amazing read and an instant favorite for me. I felt rather daunted by the task of reading it and put it off for so long... but am so glad that I finally decided to pick it up. If you are like me and are shying away from reading it, please do yourself a favor - just read it.ef was an amazing read and an instant favorite for me.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|I love veronica. The only thing I can say bad about this season is the fact that it is the last one!<br /><br />It does seem a little cut off at the end though. Didn't feel like a good closer to me. But it was still a very enjoyable season and series overall.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I really like this game you can play for hours I love the way you make money in it over all great game love it
B0098VXBIA|5.0|This movie was comedy all the way through. I laughed so hard, and I would watch it again. Two thumbs up!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My 3yr old Son, Loves this Movie! He actually sits through the whole movie almost..He loves the music, the animation, the voices are engaging..The Birds are comic & cute....colorful..just Great Kid Humor...and an all around great family movie to cuddle with ur little one & watch/laugh/sing to together!  I catch myself singing along with my son & the birds! I just Love cute movies like Rio..they are few are far! It really helps that my son luvs Birds..but this is just a GREAT kids movie that will keep your toddler watching and give u a little mom or dad time for a relaxing break for a moment:)
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Good read and am really enjoying reading Maxwell and King as partners.  There is just enough mystery and not all that sex stuff that books don't really need to be a good read.  David Baldacci puts just enough in but isn't vulgar and the stories keep me interested.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|With the star studded cast, i had much higher hopes for this movie. The story is good, but it just feels like something was missing. With hind sight, i would've waited till this movie was discounted or available on prime.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I could watch these over and over! This is my favorite season overall. I really enjoy how this series keeps you interested by having a mini-mystery every episode but a larger mystery presiding over the whole season.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this. Play it all the time, works well, no gliches.  Has winning deal, or random deal, so you can choose.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have finished this book in less than 48 hrs I'm so stuck to it my husband is annoyed!! That's what he gets for buying me a Kindle.

B009157BWU|5.0|Really touching, I am going to watch this wonderful movie over a hundred times. It was creative, also the best Disney nature movie.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Not waterproof, the bubbles in the screen mostly came out, but I couldn't stand hearing the vibrations of the plastic whenever noise was coming out of the speakers. I'm returning it. Bummer.
B001C46P2K|5.0|Although I haven't made a career of it, I've studied Victoria and Albert to some extent, and I was very pleased with the way this movie handled their history, their personalities, and their early love story.  The filmmakers managed to pack their meeting, engagement, and first three years of their marriage into one bundle, including real incidents as well as taking justifiable artistic license with others.  Several times I could identify a situation as reminiscent of a letter or journal entry, sometimes exactly translated.  (For instance, one of Victoria's favorite features of Albert's was his white throat, and upon waking after their wedding night she stroked the opening of his nightshirt.  The Young Victoria captures this and many other scenes with such grace and tenderness that it truly takes one's breath away.)<br /><br />As a lover of historical dramas/romances, I must say this rendition of a well-known story set the bar for other films in the genre.  The writing is excellent and the cast executes it seamlessly; the sets and costume design are the best I've seen since Amadeus (it did win the Academy Award for best costume design); the soundtrack is subtle and evocative, with the Victoria/Albert themes composed in such a way that one melody supports another, quite like their relationship.  Altogether they have managed to bring Queen Victoria and Prince Albert down from their portraits and paintings and made them real and human, multi-dimensional people with problems and feelings and passions just like ours--and the movie leaves you feeling as if you're on a first-name basis with them.<br /><br />Most importantly, I think, is how the movie made me feel: loved, and in love.  Five stars isn't enough in my opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A fun way to pass the time. I am hooked can't wait to finish and see how the mystery ends.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I loved it it was great the only thing wrong is it would freeze only had that happen to me once. and I didn't really like the voices of the characters except batman's. I got the game for sale only $1.00 which was during halloween and Christmas. same thing for the spiderman game. but other wise I loved the game and it was wonderful and not really hard to play.
030758836X|5.0|Don't worry - no spoilers here.  AND don't listen to the negative reviews!  I thoroughly enjoyed this book: the writing style, the page-turning prose, the characterization, and the interesting, thought-provoking plot.  I could hardly put this book down, so it's a quick read.  The ending is surprising, but if you really stop to consider these characters and who they are, you'll realize that the book could not have ended any other way.  The ending is consistent with the characters.  Many of the themes in this book will make you THINK and will force you to evaluate some of the relationships in your life (past and present).  Bottom line? It's entertaining, thought-provoking, and definitely recommended...and I can hardly wait for the movie!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love the idea and the graphics, it is just hard enough and has kept me occupied for hours. I think ZeptoLab did ans amazing job.

0375869026|5.0|I was looking for a new book to read so I went to my 11 year-old son and asked what to read next.  His quick reply was Wonder.  I asked about some other books he had recommended and he said \\"I moved this one up to the top of the list!\\"  I loved it and I loved the way it was written from different perspectives.  I think it should be required reading for all kids 5th-8th grade range.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and have passed my copy around so much that I think it has recently traveled to its 4th state now!

This is commonly seen wherever those groups of &#34;favorites&#34; are present at work. These egocentric and insecure folks deliberately bring misery to the &#34;excluded&#34; individuals, who are mentally stable, positive oriented, and have a healthy life philosophy.
B000FC10WU|5.0|The Body in the Library is of course classic Agatha Christie.  The book evokes a particular time and place inhabited by generally interesting characters.  I haven't read this in a long time and was surprized at how good it is.  The circumstances of the mystery allow us to be beguiled by the false trails.  This is not ponderous literature but it does serve as a good read when you just want to be entertained.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this last in the trilogy starring Christian Bale has not disappointed at all.  i thought they were changing the story completely, but they surprised me by keep a couple things in tact.<br /><br />Hardy was good as Bane, although sometimes it was difficult to understand what he was saying with that apparatus he was wearing. i love the fact they didn't introduce the Venom drug into the story!!!<br /><br />Hathaway did not detract from the film, in fact she did a damn good job.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A teenage boy and girl are tragically and fatefully aligned together as friends, soul mates, and (kind of) lovers.  The wisdom and thoughtfulness of each character is real, at times like two young (and wise) philosophers going toe to toe in a teenage sandbox.<br /><br />Great book.  I was riveted.  Parts of the book made me chortle, ponder, want to cry, and simply root for each of the two main characters.

I trudged through it and couldn't wait to finish it. I figured out the plot right away. It left so many other issues hanging. Why so much on Maddie and Hannah. It went nowhere. Maybe the next Mickey Haller will redeem Connelly but this one just missed the mark on so many levels.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|it was great.And i enjoy it watch it ever time i get time to see it.let ask you a question do you have season 5&6 i would love to that as well.

B0096MM9GG|1.0|This game force closes on level 1 at the same place every time. Game closes as soon as the first guard appears. I re-installed the game a few times but no use. All I got is 5 minutes of game play. Frustrating.
B005BCE7II|4.0|This is 3D movie with several options in packet.  Color is great in 2D or 3D.  Works well on my 3D projection system.  Used on 108&#34; screen and clarity is great!

B0086700CM|3.0|What's the point. If there isn't a real purpose to playing this game why bother. It was fun until I realized no matter how long you play...it really doesn't add up to anything. Glad it was free. I'll go back to it from time-to-time but I like something that keeps score.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is with out a doubt my favorite Christmas movie. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a laugh!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a Stephen King fan ever since I read Carrie. But for a while the books seemed to be &#34;different&#34; I can't explain what was different, but this book was very good. I especially liked the fact he used facts mingled with fiction to weave a good yarn. I wish I could do that.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|At first i thought the book was very slow but the more Letterman read from Charlotte more captivated u become. You find yourself cheering for charlie and along side him through his journey. Its an amazing book Anson think everyone under the age of twenty should be required to read it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was fast and entertaining. I haven't liked all the recent John Grisham books, but this one was fun.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Game reminded me of the old Westwood games from my childhood.  Took me a long time to complete.  I did not want to use the hints (ok I peeked once on the rope and well). Great graphics and puzzles.  Puzzles are challenging but not ridiculous.  I would have loved to see a more rewarding endgame sequence but I'll forgive that.  All in all great game.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the Gothic, ghostly, romance of the novel Wuthering Heights. The romance of the hero and heroine, and the sorrow and the grief that the two caused each other.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has an imagination which can grasp hold of your mind and not let it go.  His style of writing is such that most anyone can read and feel the ebb and flow of his story.  Though you won't want to, you can put the book down and come back to it without having to do any back read to remind you of what you have already read.  The Racketeer is a story of false conviction, plots and intrigue to \\"punish\\" a system and society that only looks for a \\"scapegoat\\".  The Racketeer wants his \\"payback\\".  I read this book while traveling cross country on a bus (yeah, right, who does THAT anymore, eh?).  I have read most all of John Grisham's books.  I consider this one of the best he has come up with.  Happy reading.
0670023329|4.0|A compelling look at North Korean society and politics. An amazing and heartbreaking story but, ultimately, one man's triumph over evil.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I absolutely love this app!  It gives lots of cool information and you can change the colors on the meter for the battery.  I would definitely recommend this app to anyone.
B006RXQASA|1.0|I did not care for Clerks, as it is definitely meant for the younger adult.  The language and content were offensive.  I turned it off half-way through the feature.
0765357151|4.0|I've seen the movie version of I Am Legend at least twice, probably three times. And up until maybe a year ago, I didn't realise that it was actually a book, and a sci-fi classic to boot. Which also made me think - how many movies are based on, or inspired by a book we don't even know about?<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of reading a book after seeing the movie - I always find movie versions are either a) completely different or b) a big fat let-down, so I was a little wary when I started reading. I really thought I wouldn't be able to get Will Smith's face out of my mind.....<br /><br />However, right from the beginning I realised that the book version of I Am Legend is different in several ways to the movie, and not once did I imagine Neville as Will Smith. The book is more personal and intimate than the movie, and the hopelessness and isolation Neville experiences comes through strongly. There is less action and less vampire spookiness, but their presence was always in the back of my mind the whole way through.<br /><br />I'm really glad I put my habits aside and decided to read I Am Legend - and I will definitely be recommending it to anyone that interested in reading a sci-fi classic. There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been said a thousand times and a hundred different ways before, but I found I Am Legend to be far more character-focused and emotionally intense than I imagined it would be.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I got to say, I laughed pretty hard at this movie. I wasn't too sure about a movie with a talking stuffed animal. I seemed a bit cheesy. But I laughed anyway an that's all I want from a comedy.<br /><br />It's rated R, so if you're easily offended, don't watch it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The developer of this application should be fired.  This is a terrible representation of Kindle product design. Must be fixed with an update asap!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|I initially was very skeptical of this movie, as I am a rabid fan of the original movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I was very pleasantly surprised, as this reinvention of the original story did a great job of integrating classic dialogue, characters, and scenes into a truly unique, fast-paced, and exciting movie.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The book was so wonderful it kept  the  suspense of fantasy books it kept the suspens e I was hoping  for!!!!!!!!!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Not much you can say about an USN Cable, it was the right length and now I can download large files from my computer directly to my Kindle Fire.
1907590331|4.0|I debated about whether to write a review of Of Mice and Men - after all, it's been reviewed and dissected about 7 gajillion times, right? But then I got to thinking - if I hadn't read it because I was a little scared of reading Steinbeck, maybe others feel the same?<br /><br />Required reading wasn't big in Australian schools when I was a teenager, and if there was a required reading it was almost always an Australian author (Nevil Shute for example), so it's a slightly sad state of affairs that I was 30 years old before I read my first Steinbeck. I'm not a fan of 'classics' as it goes - I always thought if I read one I'd have to say lots of really meaningful, intellectual-type things about it. So I'm just going to say exactly what I thought - no delving into themes, discussions or dissections.<br /><br />Of Mice and Men evokes perfectly the era, the characters and the lives of roving farm workers - the writing is lyrical yet simplistic and the dialogue is liberally peppered with accent, which makes it all the more realistic.<br /><br />The story itself is short and simple in the telling - two friends bound by circumstance and loyalty, in a situation that is never going to end well. George is a down-to-earth kinda guy, and empathizing with Lennie is easy - after all, a gentle giant would never hurt anyone, right?<br /><br />There's nothing to be scared about here - it's a simple, quick story that's rich with atmosphere and characterisation. My only criticism is that it is a little too short - I wanted more!

B004XWMXW4|5.0|I just recently started listening to classical music, and so far my favorite is 2Cellos.  They are so amazingly talented, and I love all their songs.  In fact, this is the first CD I've bought in over five years.  I just had to have it.
B00773YOB4|3.0|There are a couple of songs on this cd that I really liked, but more that were just okay.  I expected more.  The good songs are good and the others are just okay.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Hacking, espionage and secret ops oh my! Although this is my first Clancy book and can not compare it to his previous work, I will say that this book has made me want to read more Clancy!<br /><br />Believe the hype, it's that good!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome!!  I love it and it got to my house faster than I thought it would!  Definitely recommend it to anyone!
014241543X|5.0|The last time I read a book at the end of a 24 hour read-a-thon it was a fun read but nothing mind blowing. And when I'm getting to the stage of needing to prop my eyes open with toothpicks, I choose books that I think will be a quick, easy read. Although If I Stay was a quick read, it wasn't necessarily an easy one....<br /><br />If I Stay is a book that seemed simple when I read the synopsis - but within the first few pages I realised that this would be a book that I loved - Mia's family are simply fantastic, and I loved that she wanted to be with them as much as possible. Their banter, their personalities and their bond as a family really had them under my skin. And throughout her tragedy, and her inner fight, flashbacks to her life before the accident, both with her family, and with the boy she loves, really cemented all the characters into my heart. The scene with her grandfather in the hospital particularly got to me.<br /><br />As a character I really liked that Mia was different from the stereotypical YA heroine - with a passion for music, for her family and a not-always-perfect relationship, it was easy to like her and to sympathise with her story.<br /><br />Emotional, compelling, touching, I enjoyed If I Stay so much that I immediately bought the sequel, Where She Went, on Kindle and read it all in the same sitting.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|I really cannot say much except that the acting left a lot to be desired.  I usually love Rufus Sewell and he wasnt in the movie enough to really carry it.  the story concept was a good fantasy but I think if it was written a little differently it may have flowed better.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Great for rooms with little space. Had a problem using original Kinect around bed in bedroom. No more climbing on bed to use.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|***There are not enough stars in all of goodreads to adequately rate this remarkable story!!!***<br /><br />Okay, so this is a book that I would normally gush and go on about for multiple paragraphs, but seeing as how the AVERAGE review for Hopeless is nearly 5 stars (something I have never come across in my numerous reviews on GR) and there have been thousands of them, I'm going to keep this relatively short.  Colleen Hoover made a fan out of me with her Slammed series, and I've been anxiously awaiting any new work of hers ever since. Well, with Hopeless Colleen has thrown down the gauntlet for other authors in her genre with a story that shakes you to the core and tears your heart out while taking you on one of the most tender journeys of love and healing I've ever read! Every aspect of this book was written and carried out in exquisite detail, and I loved every. single. minute.<br /><br />With incredibly lovable characters, a raw and intense plot that grips you at every turn, perfectly-timed humor played out in clever dialogue, and passion unlike any other, this book was perfection exemplified. The way Colleen tied moments together as the story went along just took my breath away, each time taking me by surprise and amazing me with the ingenuity of her twists. This was truly a brilliantly written story that just turned me inside out as I read it.<br /><br />Sky and Holder flew right to the top of my favorite characters list well before the last pages were in reach, and I was just lost in the magic that is this couple.  Even before I knew all of the heartbreaking twists and revelations, they were near and dear to my heart, and in the end I was hoping with everything I had that these two broken souls could somehow be each other's salvation. It tore me apart watching them go through so much pain and anguish, and I went through so many emotions as I read their story.  I was so incredibly angry at times with the horror that these characters had to endure, and my heartsoared right along with them as they gave all of their heart and soul to each other.  It was absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />I wish we could have more of these characters (including Sky's BFF Six, who I loved), because saying goodbye at the end of this book was just painful. But no matter what, they will always have a special place in my heart, and I am forever grateful to Colleen Hoover for giving us this absolutely unparalleled story!! I didn't like it, I didn't live it, I LOVED it!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|An unbelievable show, I couldn't stop watching it. I cannot wait for the rest of the season in February!! I'm not a big TV show watcher, but this is a must!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is an awesome, free Mahjong game!! It's a wonderful brain boosting tool that helps with eye/hand coordination. Thank you Mahjong Deluxe!
1400052181|5.0|I quite enjoy a bit of non-fiction occasionally, but it has to be entertaining. And honestly, going into this one, I was quite worried that it would be far too science-y for me - I hated science at school because I just wasn't interested.<br /><br />But with The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, Rebecca Skloot has taken a subject and turned it into a far more emotional story than just the tale of how one woman's cells became the building blocks of modern medicine. The scientific / medical parts are written in a way that are easily understandable, and dotted with interesting, well-presented facts that grabbed my attention, and actually had me wanting to know more.<br /><br />Alongside the science, there is also a very human side to the story. From diagnosis, to treatment to Henrietta's early death, Ms Skloot tells the tale with a sympathetic yet straight-forward voice. As she becomes more and more involved with the story behind HeLa and begins the arduous task of gaining the trust of Henrietta's family in order to find out as much as possible about the mystery lady behind one of the greatest advancements in medicine, I liked her more and more.<br /><br />The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is more than a non-fiction book. It's a moving, and sometimes shocking investigation into the life of Henrietta, her family and the fall-out from the scientific advances made using her cells. From the radical treatments, lack of information, complete lack of consent, through to the investigation into homes for the disabled in the 1950's, there were many times during this book that I was completely floored that parts of history have been so completely glossed over.<br /><br />Even if non-fiction isn't your thing, The Immortal Life of Henrietta lacks doesn't feel like non-fiction at all - there's far too much emotion, and it's far too compelling to be considered just another non-fiction book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I really like this show. I hope that the character grows more as a person as the series continues.  Being the underdog will get tiresome after awhile.
B009WJ14FA|2.0|I didn' see a notation of explicit lyrics before purchased. The f bomb was dropped in the first song. Very disappointing that music that sounds this good would require expression at the fifth grader level. This is my wife's account but I purchase the music. Appears this will be my first and last for this band.

B008Q3NNVQ|3.0|Interesting bio, but the time line bounces around it seems like a lot of work to keep track of. Overall ok book though.
B000TU16GS|4.0|I definitely recommend it to the teen who is into action and adventure. I loved it and i hope you do to.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|While I don't appreciate the change to the canon story, I do understand that they needed a story of some kind. The integration of quests go well with the story offered, instead of the \\"do this cause we say so\\" typical for this type of game. Having the voice actors from the show read the parts was a very nice touch. The animation is just plain adorable. My only true complaint is it seems like Princess Luna is unattainable, or at least a long way off considering Nightmare Moon is the big bad. Despite it's issues, I think Hasbro can actually say \\"NAILED IT!\\" with pride.<br />P.S. I've heard a pony that likes to play \\"Where's Waldo\\" is unlockable if you find her and give her a poke.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Bosch is always good.  Police drama weaves into personal life.  Not an action packed thriller, but holds attention and keeps you reading.
B001H4NXCK|5.0|It's simply just a fun western comedy with a great cast. I especially enjoy that James Garner, the original TV series Maverick, was able to be involved in this film. There are a few lines/scenes that you'll appreciate more if you are familiar with the 1957-1962 TV series, or the movie Lethal Weapon for that matter... But, if not, it is still a great movie that I enjoy watching time and time again.
0439882826|4.0|I have some of Reinharts Pop-up books and really enjoy them.  This was a good book but I somehow expected so<br />much more.
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|Great movie was waiting for a movie like this along time love the game great prequel to halo 4 game
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Most Sy Fi I find is cheesy and though there may be a touch of it here this series is very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. Just don't think too much and enjoy the movie.
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|I love mega bloks. They are built superior to legos in the sets. I love how they blend the bricks to give you a unique looks that is really 1 of a kind to your individual set. This set is amazing because it gives you a true machine gun warthog. Something every halo fan recognizes. The toy is great fun and rolls quite well. As for difficulty to put together I would say 2 of 5. Only downside I personally dislike is the \\"ammo can\\". on the two other warthog sets I own it is an actual ammo can that fits well. With this one it is 3 pieces that do not work anywhere near as well.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This app is poorly put together and requires Internet access for most of the game. I would not recommend this game to my 5 year old niece, because it would not pose a challenge for even her.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Fun for all. Everyone will find something about this movie to like. Don't forget to watch the preview after the credits.
0671646788|5.0|This is an awesome book that others will learn things that they can use in every day life. It will challenge your thinking.

B007SPN5MA|3.0|I am a fan of Glen Hansard.  I was disappointed.  I was expecting music the quality of Once.  The sound of the recording was not what I was expecting. I did not even like the cover on the album. Does he need a good producer?
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Action packed, good acting and a well written script.  My wife enjoyed the movie as well. I can't wait to watch Taken 2.
B00A9X7X6C|1.0|Doesnt worth a penny ,bad movie, nothing to say exept you are wasting your money!<br />besides that nothing more to say
B004LWZW8I|4.0|I enjoyed the movie; yeah, it had it's usual plots, action, boy meets girl, the Greek Mythology,but I enjoy these types of movies.  From Hercules Unchanged to the current, I enjoy the CGI and the imagination of what Life would have been like at the Cradle of Democracy, the supposed values of the time, the history vs. the myth. I am happy with my product and will pursue more of this ilke in the future!! Thank-you.  Keith H.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I tried quite a few photo editors on my Kindle Fire HD, before downloading the Lite version of PicShop.  After enjoying the free version and wanting more, the $2.50 price tag was more than reasonable.  The only thing I could hope for in a future update is a fix for when I load a picture, and it just says &quot;Sharing&quot; without it opening what I selected.  However this only happens once out of every 30-40 pictures I load.
B00479SVBU|1.0|This unit looked fine, was packaged well, and operated smoothly through its menu options. However, the transmission was AWFUL. There was literally no bass spectrum transmission, just static. I tried it on every channel, in every EQ setting on the object, and in two different cars, both of which have used a supposedly cheaper radio transmitter with clean sound, and it just wouldn't produce even acceptable quality sound. The fact that it's only the bass end of the spectrum that is awfully static-y tells me that it's defective. I'm attempting to contact Satechi customer service, but it's a weekend, so I'm hoping to hear from them soon.<br /><br />Besides that, it has a nice display, and the remote control is awesome. Everything else worked great. It just didn't produce a clean sound.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was a great read. Normally, I take five or six days to read a  book. This one I finished in three. It was difficult to put down. The recollection of training, missions, and the political side was intriguing.

B0053TMP24|5.0|I always wonder how such a man can come up with amazingly ideas and take those thoughts to written art work. It stirs my emotion from laughter to anxiety to page turning experiences. The whole series is wonderfully. Plus how he seems to take one thing in the beginning that seems quite minor to reveal how much it actually meant and shows how it was a huge clue.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I absolutely love this app! It is so much fun, addicting even. There's nothing wrong with it either. I even played it nonstop until I got the golden piggy pac.

B000URWYTS|5.0|This was a book club selection...and after I started, I couldn't put it down.  I kept saying NO, NO, NO, to the main character... and toward the end, I thought maybe this could all work out in spite of breaking all the rules and hurting so many people...then, the horrow of the ending.  It gave me nightmares for a couple of days.  Our book club discussion of this book was the best ever!
B001GNFT1K|4.0|It was a speedy delivery. The box was fully sealed/brand new, but the inside piece that the first disc hangs on was broken. But the disc were fine.

The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, etc, all released similar items afterwards no doubt influenced by the Beatles' version of themselves telling their story.<br /><br />Beatles #1 was the same thing, year after other bands had put out greatest hits album theirs still sold the most, and others quickly followed the formula (Elvis #1, Michael Jackson #1).<br /><br />So with their 2009 remasters, others followed, again, with the Stones, Beach Boys, etc releasing similar sets on CD or vinyl shortly after. I must say this Beatles is perfect. The book is beautifully printed, like an even better/different anthology - it is essentially the CD booklets all in on book for each album with additional info. The records themselves are great too, the sound is improved even if it's not a huge improvement (I'm already used to the CD remasters, so I guess it didn't phase me much, just sounds like good Beatles music!).
B007SGM084|4.0|The first book was really hard  to get through for me, though I'm not really a porn person. It took about a month. People kept telling me to keep going, that it gets better. I'm glad I kept reading, it took about a month to finish both the second and last book. It was very tense at some points. There were lots of nights I couldn't put the book down. I would read this rather than study even. Can't wait for the movie to come out,  my friends and I will be the first ones in line at the midnight show!
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|everything you have ever dreamed of , but would not confess to anyone ... you will see in this movie
0345803485|5.0|You can not stop reading it.<br />The best book of the trilogy, is intriguing, sophisticated, informative and so interesting.<br />I fully recommend this book.

B005HSL626|4.0|I love this game a lot.  But I find myself having to restart my kindle to close the app fully. It may be a bug, please fix and this app will be great.
B00006YXJ5|5.0|This album went Gold (500,000+) when it should've sold diamond (10 million). It is every bit as good as, if not better than, Band On The Run, Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Ram - all the other solo Beatle albums that get talked about.<br /><br />Any Road opens it up with beautiful slide playing, and sets the tone of the album which is searching. George knew he had months to live, and the album reflects that soul searching even if this song was written in 1988.<br /><br />P2 is just a bluesy song, not out of place on a Clapton album.<br /><br />Pieces Fish is beautiful, mellow, calm reflective of a very wild life he lived.<br /><br />I could go on, I will say the &#34;indian harp&#34; (forget the correct name) as used in Strawberry Fields is used again on Marwa Blues which is possibly the best song on the album.<br /><br />An all around great, but serious, record. Similar to Traveling Wilburys, or Cloud Nine with a more relaxed, current Flaming Pie feel. A very great and underrated record. Good job Jeff Lynne and Dhani.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it this game is awesome or should I say these games are awesome.  this is the best game

B004EBZX6W|5.0|Of course this app is useful for finding and deciding which network to connect to, but I recently used it to reconfigure my home network using Cisco range extenders. The app was quite valuable in determining where to place the range extenders to get the most bang for the buck. Great price too!
0385535147|5.0|Enjoying this novel.  As usual, John Grisham delivers a very entertaining piece of fiction.  If you like John Grisham's work, you will enjoy this.
0345803493|3.0|It's a little slower than the first one, and all the problems and good stuff happens at the end, so if you get bored at the beginning hang on, the ending is quite good!

1449410243|4.0|We bought a couple of these for Christmas gifts.  My husband started reading one before I could wrap it for my step-son.  Luckily for my husband, it stayed at our house.  He sits and reads and laughs.  I've picked it up a few times and find it mildly funny.  Maybe more guy type humor.  Also, if you don't have or haven't had a cat, you probably won't find it as funny.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Pretty good book.  Will share and test out the concepts from the book in the near future with friends and at the work place.

0756405890|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has found that balance that let's the reader get lost in his words and for a moment loose track of time.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|I get sick of watching the same predictable chick flicks so was hesitant in watching this. I also was nervous that this movie would be very similar to 50 First Dates. This movie is neither of these things and instead is just a great film.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best book in the series and I don't know yet because I haven't read the ugly truth
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It wasn't what I expected and I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book, if you love love stories.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|ALL MY FAVORITES ARE IN THIS MOVIE ACCEPT STEVEN SEAGEL .!?? OH WELL,I LIKED IT. THE FRIST ONE IS BETTER.BUT HEY 3RD TIME A CHARM,RIGHT?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have ever read.  You really get a feel for the main character, Charlie, and his love for Sam.  The entire book feels so realistic that you'll forget it's fiction.  One of my favorite things about this book is the fact that it doesn't follow any storyline in the traditional sense, without any any major superior plot or conflict.  It's just a quirky boy and the story of his life.  I would recommend book to anyone who can read.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Fully restored and glorious, this might be the best film ever made.Viewed on a 106&#34; screen with an Epson 8350 projector, it doesn't get any better than this.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|What can I say but Chris Nolan and Christian Bale are two of my favorite directors & actors.  Love the Batman trilogy and found the third installment to be the best.  Well done guys.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a fun game.  I love mystery and puzzle games.  I,also, like that you can choose the level of difficulty.  Anyone who loves mysteries would like this game.  It might be a little too scary for younger children.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Best one in the series by far!!!<br />Could of let Percy help Poseidon in Atlantis though and defeated oceanus and make him fade
034580404X|5.0|E.L. James is an excellent writer.  This is a book of fantasy, sex, and has a good story to it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the read and must say I found the books hard to put down.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I really enjoyed the idea of this show. Its not very often that you find yourself rooting for the bad guy....I cant wait to watch season 2!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good entertainment. great for the free price but I'd say even worth paying two or three dollars for.it. Good game for when you just need to kill a little time. one of the rules I didn't know at first is that you have to use the whole board.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|More than a story about treating others with kindness, this is actually a book about intentionally choosing what kind of human being we want to be. Through this story of morale dilemmas the author demonstrates how our choices define the type of person we are to become. In order to be a person of strong positive character, we must develop those traits by doing the right thing over and over and over. Good character doesn't just happen, it is built and starts with a basic choice about how we want to live our life.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game.  I love dragons so a game that lets me raise them is a good one for me.  If you love dragons and raising games you should get this game.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|If you are into singing and dancing kind of movies Pitch Perfect is right up your alley! I love movies that good wholesome movies I wouldn't mind my grandkids watching. There are a few swear words, and some indication of sex activity, but other than that, the blends are beautiful and music pleasing. I really enjoyed this movie.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|What a great christmas movie for the entire family! It is so well written and we watch it every year. It never gets tiresome.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|If it weren't for the ending, this would just be another two star movie. It has the standard bad acting and lack of plot.<br />Small town is being terrorized by a shapsehifter that they mistakenly call a werewolf. I would have been content to leave it there were t not for the ending.<br />###SPOILER###<br /><br />In the end the wolf is the dad just like you suspect from the first minute f the movie. What gets me is that when he offers to take the girl away with him as the wolf, she is like you are the devil. It royally irked me that she shunned such a sacred gift offer, but to add insult to injury, when the boyfriend is bit, she is all excited to run away as a wolf with him!
B000LGZHDS|5.0|This Gary is a great likeness to the cartoon character, is a quality plush toy, and is the perfect size for my desk!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a basic set of the three movies and we love it.  All we needed for a great price!
6302763835|5.0|I turned this movie on almost half way through and couldn't stop watching it to the conclusion. The way the tarantula was shown crawling over the desert is just priceless, rather graceful and precise, occasionally knocking into power lines and causing outages but not getting hurt. Don't know why these scenes please me so but they do. Maybe because it was better done than any number of dinosaur movies I saw as a child. Maybe it goes to show the fear of giant monsters in 50's movies is either ingrained in people who lived then or can be acquired in an instant by anyone from any culture. The cinematography of the desert landscape, small towns, lab/house, other animals and vehicles was very good. Loved the scientist's convertible ('55 Ford Fairlane?)and how it overpowered the empty desert landscape as the tarantula did. On an analytical note, maybe the massive power line towers were also seen as a fearsome thing and seeing them bumped by a monster was almost a good thing. I was sad when the tarantula met his end, again, don't know why. I'm not a big fan of monster films but this is now my favorite movie monster of all time.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The DVDs are awesome....love it! loved that they also have the 2 CDs of the concert to listen to! My favorite Band of all time.....it was great to be able to watch this concert!
6304385668|2.0|Having just traveled to Ireland, I was interested in the history.  The story is great and the shipping was fast, however, the last 45 minutes of the tape was bad.  It was scratchy, hesitant and the audio was poor.  Since this was the real heart of the movie, it was very distracting.  The only reason I purchased the tape was that there were no DVDs available.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love the show the storyline and actors are top drawer.<br /><br />Hate that Amazon won't sell a complete current season all at once. No reason they can't.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|With >2,000 reviews already published, I will not delve into detail here.<br /><br />What I will say is I am a big fan of George R.R. Martin; I think he weaves an exciting - if complex - story in all his books. I almost *never* re-read a book, but with the long wait for this final volume in his series, I found I had to re-read the preceding volumes to remember all the plot lines. And I did so with pleasure...he's that good!<br /><br />But this book...simply disappoints. I cannot help think that GRRM in the end had created so many plot lines and so many loose ends he got to this book and found it impossible to cleanly close out the stories. And as the years passed and frustration mounted, it did not get any easier for him.<br /><br />Now, I am not so narrow that I expect every line to end in a clean, fairytale (or demontale?) manner. But...as the (in theory) final book, it sure would have been nice to draw at least the major threads to a logical conclusion. MINOR SPOILER: If that's what you are looking for in this book, you will also be disappointed...it's just not very good at wrapping up much of anything. If you want finales...go find another book series to read.<br /><br />In the places that GRRM did try to tie up loose ends, he seems to have gravitated to either simply killing off the character, leaving you with some other cliffhanger that (most probably) will never be addressed, or - worst of all - simply ignoring them and leaving you wondering. While I do not object to his periodic killing of major characters, in at least two cases in this book their deaths are very sudden, with little set-up and feel practically random. I could hear him saying to himself: \\"I don't know what to do with this guy...and I can't go further with him...so I'll just kill him\\". Ugh. I will not spoil the plot with who gets the axe this way, but suffice it to say that one in particular was so sudden and random as to be almost laughable. And I can think of two major, major characters who,in the end, are almost completely ignored in this book...wandering out there in the wilderness...with no plot progression. I was left wondering...why did he include them in 5 volumes of writing, tracking their progress, only to abandon them without a final word?<br /><br />I almost gave this book 3 stars because of the body of work. But on reflection, I would give the earlier volumes 5 or 4 stars (start with 5 and move down a bit as the series progresses and he clearly starts to run out of steam). But taken as a single volume, I can't give this particular book more than 2 stars. It is beautifully written, but the almost complete lack of effort bring major plot lines to a finale left me...as the title says...disappointed.
B003LAH7MU|2.0|After hearing [[ASIN:B005HXGE9G New Blood]], Peter Gabriel's inventive orchestral renditions of his own songs, I had high hopes for this CD. Sting has been my favorite musician since the 80s, and as prolific a career as he's had, he has certainly earned the right to \\"revisit\\" his work as often as he wants (and this project was, apparently, by request.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my hopes. Most of the arrangements have so many pop elements that they really aren't that different from the original songs. There was nothing that distinguished them enough from the originals to make me care about them. They have the same pop beats and follow the same progression and tempo, and the orchestra plays almost the same music that Sting's musicians played on the original recordings. (A clarinetist on \\"Englishman in New York\\" was assigned the dull task of recreating Branford Marsalis' playing almost note for note. *Yaaawn.*) Overall the arrangements lack originality and don't present a unique take on Sting's songs, as was done with Peter Gabriel's on \\"New Blood.\\"<br /><br />There are four exceptions: Roxanne, I Burn For You, Black Seam, and The Pirate's Bride. Roxanne and Pirate's Bride in particular are hauntingly beautiful. (Though I can imagine many Police fans rolling their eyes at a symphonic version of Roxanne!)<br /><br />And as much as I love Sting's voice, I think an instrumental take on the better known songs would have been a worthwhile creative endeavor by these orchestras. It would have distinguished them further from the originals and allowed the melodies to shine apart from the lyrics.<br /><br />The other things that disappointed me about this CD was the song selection. It's mostly \\"B-side\\" songs. Sting's popular hits are not included (unless you count Roxanne).

0375714839|4.0|\\"Persepolis\\" is the author's autobiographical tale of life as a young woman growing up in Tehran during the Islamic revolution. I was skeptical about the graphic novel format at first, but have heard so many great things about this book that I had to give it a try, and I am sure glad I did. This is such a brutal and honest story about what life was like in Iran during this time, and how dangerous it was to live in this part of the world when so much terror was going on. The story is especially gripping because it is told from the perspective of a young female, who focuses in on what this time period did for women's rights (basically eliminated them altogether) and details how her life ended up spiraling out of control as a result of it. My biggest complaint about the book is that I feel it ends too abrubtly...I turned the page and was all, \\"What?? That's it?!?!\\" It would have been nice to even have some kind of epilogue to learn what happened to the characters after that point. In spite of that, though, this is a book I really enjoyed and couldn't put down over the course of the three days it took me to read. Definitely check this one out.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was hard to put down. All the drama, rooting for Katniss and Peeta I can't wait get the next book. I highly recommend this book.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|OK, so all these guys have beautiful bodies and know, more or less, how to move.  They take money for their performances and have dreams beyond the week end \\"bump and grind.\\"  This movie is a poor excuse for some soft porn with no compelling tension or plot to tie it together.  The end is predictable, the middle is too long (where is a good editor when you need one) with the salacious left in long and hard to grab the middle aged over weight lady demographic???  I don't know.  Either way, it could not be considered anything but, as other reviewers have indicated, BAD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have read this book 3 times now and I love it more and more each time I read it! Thank you Suzanne Collins!!!!
B008RTE08E|3.0|I love the Beatles music, but this movie was not what I expected.  It is not a &#34;bad&#34; movie; it just did not have a lot of &#34;behind the scenes&#34; fotage that I would rather see.  It was a little too psychidelic for my taste.
1444710338|3.0|I guess I was expecting a book that just said what I need to do, and what I can eat in each phase. It does say those things, but with SO MUCH other stuff too!! So basically you have to skim through this whole book to find the important details..it's just not what I wanted. But I am still using it..I have those specific detailed pages marked.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A simply great and outstanding book. I am reading it for a school project and it has worked great for that.

A wonderful read but I need another one please!<br /><br />Ross Gauld<br />Houston, Texas

B000AMJG4Y|4.0|just like always when Square Enix releases a movie, it has hands-down the best CGI graphics in the business and even eclipsing whatever LucasArts / George Lucas can do with CGI, but the story is rather bland and/or terrible.  In this case it was terrible, as the voice acting was easily a D- and the overall plot was a C-.  Yet the A+ graphics keep me coming every time and I buy every lousy film they pop out of their studios because of it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Who doesn't love Harry Bosch?  Another great tale from Michael Connelly.  Those of us who remember the riots in LA in 1992 can identify with this fictional account.  Even if you aren't that old you will be caught up in this great story.
B004DM0UII|4.0|This is a solid Internet radio app. As many before me have said, this has a very similar feature set to much of the other radio apps already on the market.<br /><br />That said, some of the fine details impress me here. On this,or any other music app, I rarely see any comments regarding bit rate&hellip; Which makes me wonder if I am the only person with a mobile data-cap??? This app has a wonderful feature where when you search or browse stations you can filter by a certain bit rate of your choosing. For those of us with a data limit, this is amazingly useful. While I really like listening to Internet radio, I have no intention of using all of my mobile data in a short few days.<br /><br />Other nice features I didn't find elsewhere include a history of songs listened and the ability to tag a song for later viewing. This is wonderfully useful if you want to download the song from Amazonmp3 later on (when you get to a PC or within wifi?).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I do not see any local radio stations herein, nor any specific feature to pull up your local radio stations based on location, etc.. This is one feature I really like about TuneIn radio.<br /><br /> All in all, a good app. Hopefully they continue to improve it, listening to feedback from users, and in the end make it a great music app.

B008MEM24S|5.0|I absolutly LOVE this game. I just can't figure out how to get Dr Doofensmirtz. Anyway, great game, please make more levels!!
B008D37SGU|3.0|I bought this movie for my daughter who loves the main actor. It was OK, but I had to watch it in two sittings because it was basically a study  into this womans clinical depression which is well...... depressing.  After an hour of her looking through a window and contiplating- whatever- I had to go do something else and finish it later.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham at his best again.  Well defined characters.  This is a typical Grisham story with a good story and interesting characters. Lots of twists, which you expect from this well read author.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is very exciting. You feel like you're the characters in the book. I would read other books by Suzanne Collins.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It a great book that is awesome for the whole family. It's supper funny and interesting. You can't stay away from this wonderful book. Can not wait for next book. 5 stars.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|Having taken so long to get around to reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I was very impressed and look forward to reading more stories by Stieg Larsson.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|cannot view my own uploaded videos unless they're on my recent timeline.  on a laptop or computer there is a link for Videos.  no such link in this app or on the mobile m.facebook site.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is possibly one of the best games created In the history of games. For one reason, even though I say this about all games, it is soooooo addictive! =-) You will probably catch me on this game for hours at a time. I have nothing else to say except that this is the best game on my kindle fire!
B00785P2QC|4.0|c`est un jeu tres bien mais au bout dun momoent sa devient tres ennuyant mais il ne faut pas y rester toute la journée, il faut y aller au moins une fois par jour
B008CX2A2I|5.0|The Onkyo UBT-1 USB Adapter was delivered in record time. I plugged it into my TX-NR 717 receiver's front USB port, followed the easy directions to pair the adapter/receiver with my iPhone and immediately I was able to play music from my iTunes library as well as use the remote control app for my receiver. The music was great and I plan yo try out other features in the near future. My only problem with the pairing is, if the receiver is playing another connection such as D D or Sat TV and I receive an email or call on my iPhone, the receiver immediately switches to USB mode. The only way to get around this is to unpair the USB adapter or to shut off my iPhone while watching TV. I need to troubleshoot this glitch.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is relaxing allowing you to use your mind.I am going to enjoy teaching my grandchildren<br />how to play.I am looking toward to challenges. with my husband (out on the rig) , and my facebook friends.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Never thought that Dylan would do Christmas but it remains our favorite for Christmas.  My son has all of Dylan and this is quickly becoming one of his favorites
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is super helpful and very easy to use. it is useful when charging my kindle, and i have had no problems with it! best $00.00 i've ever spent!
B005HSL626|3.0|This game is very fun and excellent! There's just one thing I hate about it that angers me. Look ill just explain it like this.<br /><br />What I love about fruit ninja.<br /><br />1. Gameplay<br /><br />2.Rewards<br /><br />3. Blades<br /><br />4. Modes<br /><br />5. Fruits (they make me hungry)<br /><br />6. Features<br /><br />What I dislike about fruit ninjas.<br /><br />1. Lack of online mode<br /><br />2. Glitches and bugs (On my fruit ninjas, there's this bug that prevents me from play a certain game mode).
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|For the last two episodes my husband I stayed up until 2 am. This is more violent than the previous but I still enjoyed the series and so glad we were able to finish the saga.
0307341550|3.0|I don't think this was bad or anything like that, its just for all of the hype I didn't really understand it.  It really wasn't a page turner for me until about the last 30-50 pages when all the twists started to happen.  Entertaining read, but nothing was really keeping me up at night reading it until I was at the very end.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is my first Adele CD. I enjoy just listening to her sing much like I enjoy the way Barbra Streisand sings. Alone on the stage without the dancers, backup singers and the &#34;show&#34;.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this book was eye opening opening and inspiring . I could relate in some ways to how Charlie felt and some of what he said made me rethink my life and how I was living it. I was confused at some parts and even surprised at others. It was so worth reading and I read it in two and a half days. I think living through certain things seems a bit less scary now knowing that others have lived or even thought about the same things. This book was worth the read by far
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awsome game majong. Love the nether reactor in the last update<br />Problems:<br />When you plant a melon seed, it just disipears most the time<br />Nether reactor is so much gold<br />No stone stairs and upside down stairs<br />Good thingw: portable&#9825;&hearts;&#9825;&hearts;
B00008S7KC|3.0|I gave this as a gift. It wouldn't play in the standard DVD player or in a computer. It would only play in a Blu-Ray player even though this wasn't the Blu-Ray version.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book! IT was written very good. It had lots of funny parts.One of the best in the series.Jeff Kiney is an awesome writer!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was one of my first downloads and I love it! Haven't run into any glitches yet and I like how the settings can be easily changed.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|I watch this classic movie each Christmas season and never get tired of its message or the story. The cast is made up of &#34;Old Hollywood at their best.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this has a lot of similarities to Mario....which I think is good! gives ninytendo and others motivation to put out some fresh new games like this!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This  is a very good book. Not up to her usual standards but good. I enjoy reading her books. I have read most of them.Will continue to read them.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME.Its fun to play and you can get an assortment of power ups to make it easier<br />i would recommend thins game to people who enjoy games like temple run
B009ZE27US|1.0|even though its free it is a complete rip off of what you were probably expecting. it dosent even go below the age 20. so don't get it cuz its really dumb<br />and a complete rip off
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I anticipated the change in lead character to mean, as it often does, a let down in the action and story line.  This was not the case this time.  The writers also injected enough unanswered situations that I am already wanting the next sequel.??
B004DM0UII|5.0|it is a great app I whould get it when its free huh j j j j j in j j j j j j j j j
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's hard to find books that have just the right amount of ingredients. This book contains the stories between. the love of friendship, family, strangers, and questioning what is going on around you. There are many things we can all learn from Liesel. Such a strong girl at a young age, how can one deny of loving her character??? This story is brilliant. A must!
145470246X|5.0|great source of ideas and ways to use colors - - - - - - - - - - -
B00005AWMF|5.0|As I described most of my CD's, you get a great price, free delivery and a guarantee on top of that.  Super performer and all good songs.  Sade is in a class of her own.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm an avid reader not a writer, so with that said, I will make it simple as I do all my reviews. I don't see the need to write a book out of a review as some people do, and when I'm looking at a review, I like the short and simple and down to the grind ones.<br />I'm 49, this book is YOUNG ADULT book, something TOTALLY out of my norm, with that said, I think this is for sure one of the best books I have ever read. It has NO typos at all, which is more then I can say for 90% of the books on amazon.<br />The story, the characters, the plot, the scenery, the lies, the truths, the sadness and the joy, all of it, every single thing about this book was AWESOME.<br />Read this book, you will love it .However, be prepared, it is dark and disturbing at times, as abuse is always disturbing.<br />Thanks to the author for an amazing read. You did a great job!
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I bought this for my mom for Christmas. She loved the books and saw some of the movies. It's just the DVDs which was perfect for her, because she's not into all the extra features. If you're looking for all the special gimics though look for the other special edition sets.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|If you like to watch romantic time-period movies, you'll love this one! This is definitely in my top five movies of all time!
B00004YX39|5.0|As I described most of my CD's, you get a great price, free delivery and a guarantee on top of that.  Super performers and all good songs.  Steely Dan is really different and a class of artists of their own.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|i think this is a very fun game but it goes a little slow.  i would like it to be a little faster than it does.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|If you like family guy you will like the movie. For most people a dumb movie with laughs hear and there.
B00003CXCD|4.0|I absolutely love black and white films & Audrey Hepburn. This movie was one of my favorites when I was growing up, even though it was decades older than I was. A true classic film!
0061743526|4.0|My wife enjoys reading many books such as this classic.  I don't see how anyone could not recommend this book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is awesome. I feel like a real detective trying to solve a case. its very relaxing and hours of entertainment. the kids can enjoy. it also
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second book, if I remember correctly, got into more deeply as to WHY he was like he was and you got to understand him better.  I couldn't wait to read the third book and actually downloaded in onto my Kindle before I was even done with the second one!  I think these books were totally misunderstood by a lot of people, and so was the main character.  You really need to read all three of them to totally understand him.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I like the game but like everyone is saying it was blotchy before and with the update its even worse then before!!! Can't plant certain things and shuts down all the time. Just reinstalled it if it doesn't stop I'm going to delete it permanently
B0045XICB2|4.0|I haven't seen it but my niece, for whom it was purchased, loved it.  Great for teens and people who like the supernatural.
B00457X8BC|5.0|In typical Mankell style, The Dogs is visceral in every way. We are made to feel all of the fear and uncertainty that goes with Eastern bloc countries in the early nineties. We even feel Wallender's discomfort upon donning woolen long johns in riga. Brilliant plot, with the outcome in doubt right up to the shootout on the roof of the department store.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It's been awhile since I read this book but all I can say is that it was very good, a lot more to it than people think. Both this one & the second one went more into why he was like he was and got into the &#34;nitty gritty&#34; of it all.  I liked how it ended but wished there were more!  I thoroughly enjoyed all three of the books!
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I chose three stars for the fact that this app is slow to react when touched, and the sound is kind of flat.  Would I recommend this to anyone?  Maybe for a child who doesn't know any better, but not if you want real piano sound!  It's okay for entertainment, but I don't use it very often...:-/
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|i love the fact that u play as your own stick person (: this game is fun and addicting!!!!!!! great
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow.  This book is wonderful. Well worth the read.  It will make you want to laugh and cry - sometimes at the same time. This book is beautiful and poignant.  I highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I hate the ads but I love the game and the competition. I get frustrated with the ads. If it wasn't for the ads the game would be perfect.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|COULDN'T PUT DOWN. READ ALL THREE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE MOVIES, BUT THEY'RE NEVER AS GOOD AS THE BOOKS.
B004DM0UII|2.0|This app might be something for someone else but it does not have as many choices as Pandora and it is a confusing app but it is a good thing that people could see it and try it as the free app of the day.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|Great book awesome for anyone who wants to start selling paracord accessories at a Saturday flea market just a great book
B008JAGG38|5.0|Although it wasn't as good as the original I think it stood up pretty well. It was good to see the original actors.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very different kind of book than I read keeps you on edge to find out what is going to happen
B008XG1X18|5.0|What ever did I do before Pintrest.  I have over 40 boards now and find it really great for pinning craft projects that dont' take up room on my computer and I can always find them.  It's also fun sharing them with my niece.  It's very conveinant to have on my Kindle fire and I find myself pinning  while I'm soaking in the tub!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The bag is great on the inside!  The only thing I don't like is the back of the back pack. The straps seem a little bulky. After using it a while I may change my mind but just looking it over this is something that could be slimmed down to be more appealing.
B009HELT3C|5.0|I didn't want to watch this. I was totally against it because I like the other MIB movies ok but I didn't think they could improve them. This was a great movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this calculator as the numbers are large clear and easy to access.  I have always been able to access the calculator and have always had accurate information
0399157565|4.0|I have read all of this author's books.  This book seems a bit less gripping than other's by this author.  However, when she publishes another book I will be purchasing it. I am a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell!.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I've loved this film since I was a kid, and find any excuse to watch it. So happy with my purchase of this BR/DVD.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This is an ok movie but Kristen Stewart has like 20 lines in the entire thing. I think they should have picked someone more relatable to play snow white but the movie was decent.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I'd like it more if it wasn't so much better than I am, but the ads stay along the bottom and are not too intrusive and the difficulty level is adjustable, so I like it just fine.
B0099114WO|3.0|The theme of this movie showed in the actor's performances. They seemed a little reluctant to act the part in the sex scenes.
B000E8N690|5.0|Its always a pleasure to see history on film. Great quality, shipped when it said it would. Great Christmas gift
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This movie was far better than I had expected it to be. I didn't think it could live up to the other Bourne movies but it was definitely as good, if not better. There will be more, I am sure.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|No doubt some wonderful music but it is not what I would really consider to be the best &#34;highlights&#34; from the movie. Maybe some but not all. Still worth it for the price though.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For anyone who loves to read heart-wrenching stories that make you laugh, cry and feel every emotion in between, you have to read this book.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy this game and I like the challenge. It is a real challenge and a tough game to win.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Rarely when I rent a movie on amazon do I watch it more than once. It was a cold dreary day and this movie was hilarious. I watched it a couple times. I might buy it. If you are a gleek, you'll certainly love it.
B00062RCBW|5.0|This was a gift for a Star Trek fan and he loved it. Great price and so much easier to buy online.
0307272702|5.0|This book busted many myths and dumb things people try to hide behind during their plight to explain obesity.  I loved the insight, ideas, realities and easy reading.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Its easy, fun and really enjoyable. The interaction with people is wonderful and the challenges are a really great way to pass the time away.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love the color scheme. Great for my kindle fire! It fills the entire screen so it's good for me. It has the percent! I'm happy with it. I wish it had a completely scientific mode though only drawback I can see.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Great movie pack and great price. It was in good condition and no problems with it. Thanks and would recommend it.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|WOW! This is one of the best sequels that I have ever seen. I was a bit skeptical at first about Love Never Dies. I thougt, yeah right. Like Mr. Llyod webber is going to be able to pull off a sequel to phantom of the opera. ( which was not needed in my opinion.)I thought this muscial sequel was going to be a big flop. Boy was I wrong. Love never dies is spectacular. And it does not take away the magic of the first one.The music is so sweeping and just as powerful as the music to phantom of the opera. The sets were full of vibrant colors and I loved the opening scene of coney Island when all the freaks come out of the circus tent. It was interesting to see what happend to the characters after Phantom but at the same time I hated the changes because it was like they all did a three sixty or one eighty. For example, the phantom to me seemed less mysterious and the fact that christine apparently went back and had a child by him, dosen't really make sense especially since she seemed repulsed by him in Phantom 1 and choose Raoal over him. But then again Raoal became a bit of an ass and a drinker in the sequel, so I guess it makes some sense.And the changes in Meg and madame Giry I also hated. Why would Meg kill christine all because she now wants the phantom? This makes no sense to me since in Phantom 1 the audience was never shown any hostility between Christine andMeg.They were like best friends. Not to mention meg was terrified of the phantom. I think Love Never Dies is easier to look at as a stand alone piece rather then a sequel. But despite some flaws in the story and continuation as well as the annoying way that they had to ryhme every lyric. The sets are stupendous, the costumes wonderful, the singing and the acting are excellent. All in all a five star sequel and musical.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Super addictive...but also a bit easy. I love the fast pace puzzle solving. Easy mind numbing fun. I just wish there was more challenge.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|When I started reading it, I didn't think I would like it.  By the time I got to the fifth chapter I was hooked. It took me less than two days to finish it :)
B00003CXB4|5.0|Hard to find dvd and loved it when I saw it so I got it for my son and he loves it.
B003CI90MQ|4.0|I have not completed this book but the part that I have read it is great book for beginers like myself..
B006YXTRHY|3.0|It is what I expected.  Just want to finish the series of movies to see how the story ends.  I did not read the books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Best book I have read all year. I read quite often and typically in the contemporary romance genre. I am not going to spoil a thing. Please just take my advice and read this book. It will break your heart and put it back together again. Absolutely beautiful.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|My son plays this all the time and loves it. Would recommend for any angry birds fan. Great toy/game for them.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|I like the series, but the picture quality of this dvd was bad. I expected high definition picture which this was not.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|And always have!  It's a must see each Christmas in my family....of adults.  Not appropriate for young children, secondary to language and some scenes.
B005HSL626|4.0|I get so hungry when I play it.its always for sliced fruit.here's the funny thing.I always feel like cuting them with my own hands like you do in the game!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are great, and the movie starts out with promise, but then gets bogged down in being mostly about sex.  Left out are development of common interests - outings and conversation.  Disappointed.
B002N5N5M0|2.0|I like the series, but the picture quality of this dvd was bad. I expected high definition picture which this was not.
1844137872|5.0|Banksy is probably the best known stencil artist and in my estimation, he's definitely the best. With a distinctly global view and wicked sense of humor he slams the status-quo all over the world and at the same time creates memorable art that is critical of the worst in human nature. But also celebrates the best of us too.<br /><br />I have enjoyed watching street art and creative graffiti grow over the last 30 years (I'm a 60 year old grandma). Banksy has raised the bar so much higher. His earlier work was strongly English, with commentary on uniquely British foibles, but every year it has expanded to lambast ridiculousness everywhere. I especially loved his rat series, which was brilliant.<br /><br />This book has a smidgen of his history with just enough details to give us a view into Banksy's perspective and goals, but not enough to identify him. And that's fine with me; I love the mystery of who he might be. He gets to remain &#34;everyman&#34; or any man and speak truth to power on our behalf. This book is a wonderful introduction to his work if you haven't seen &#34;Exit Through the Gift Shop&#34; or heard of him. And, if you're a big fan, it's a delight!
B000FC1HQY|5.0|For someone who lived for a few years in Africa, this book is evocative and colourful.  On  another level it is a highly articulate and entertaining observation of the writer's relationship with her eccentric mother (and only slightly less eccentric father) during her childhood in war-torn Africa.  I've re-read it several times and always find it wonderfully funny and terribly sad.  Very readable.  A keeper.
B000VX042U|5.0|I need to buy another pair.  Someone saw them and wanted a pair for themselves. I never reveal my secret places or prices but I give them ideas of where to find them.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Let me first start off by saying that the streaming service was excellent and would give it 5 stars. The rating and the rest of the review concern the movie itself.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is about a girl, Katniss, in an impoverished 19th century style community. Then when her sister is chosen to take part in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is taken to the Capital City which is a futuristic city where the Hunger Games take place. The rest of the movie is about her survival in the games.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was at first skeptical about this movie, but the sudden twist by changing the scenery from an impoverished luddite community to a futuristic and eccentric society sold me on it. Overall the movie wasn't anything truly special to me, but it was still a movie I enjoyed watching. I don't have any intention of watching it again, but if you haven't seen this yet and nothing better to do, then I recommend at least trying this movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|SEASON 1 BLEW ME AWAY AND OTHER THAN RESCUE ME NO OTHER SHOW HAS DONE THAT<br />BUT WHEN SEASON 2 CAME OUT IT EVEN SURPASSED BOTH OF THOSE SHOWS COMBINED<br /><br />LETS JUST SAY I WATCH IT 3 OR 4 TIMES A WEEK ON MY DVR<br /><br />BRAVO TO FX AND THE CREATORS OF HANDS DOWN THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION
B009FBX5M0|5.0|This has some classic Bond songs and new ones, and I like the new style.  Some Bond purists won't like it as much, but like the great new movie, it adds to it well.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I was excited about finding this for my Kindle Fire and after playing it I am going to buy the upgrade!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Everyone should read this book ! ! I was hooked from the 1st chapter , couldn't' put it down !

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is exactly what I need on my fire that is simple and easy for me to track my \\"life\\" without complicated tabs and calanders. I use that but also like having simplicity!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|One of my favorite childhood movies. Love it. I am happy it's on DVD so I can share it with my nephews.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a really good book. The end is something you would not expect! Not a spoiler alert. Well written.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I can't wait until Homeland Season 2 is released!  Even though I have watched the &#34;previews&#34; online and &#34;basically&#34; know what happens, I want to see Season 2 in full!  LOVE IT!
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Two dimensional characters, dropped plot-points, flat dialogue, bad acting and an overall story that makes a 1962 comic book look Shakespearean. Michael Bay you ruin everything you touch. And I'm worse for having seen this.
B009A87ZKG|5.0|I am starting to acquire a collection of war movie, especially WWII movies. I find the older ones, from the 60's and 70's to have better story lines. Obviously there are fewer films being produced from that era as time goes on. But the generations that come after that event need to remember it. This film does a great job of helping us see what went on as well as a good idea of what George Patton was like. George C Scott was fantastic
B008X9Z37A|2.0|The case came in good fashion but it doesn't hold the kindle in place worth a hoot....very loose in the corners. Alot of money for a very cheaply made product. Don't buy it!!
B000P0J024|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he loves it!  One of his favorites. Great quality CD and highly recommended!
B0079XNWQA|4.0|I had never heard of this singer, but my granddaughter asked for this as a Christmas present. She told me it is a &#34;great&#34; cd.<br />I have nothing else to go by except her rating. I do know that I could not find it locally, but Amazon, once again, came through.
0553381695|5.0|I started reading the Song of Ice and Fire books after the first season of Game of Thrones premiered. It is one of my favorite book and movie series! I cant wait to finish it!
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Jiro Ono, an 80 year institution has spent the better of his life running a limited seat sushi restaurant in Japan. For about $ 375 dollars a plate, one gets the best sushi that you have ever tasted. This sushi, apparently is so good that sushi aficionados take a trip to Japan just to sample this treat. However the documentary is not just about sushi but also about many aspects that make an individual successful in business and life.<br /> There are many life lessons that can be learned from Jiro Ono, such as loving the path that was chosen as a vocation, Jiro loves making sushi so much that he sources only the best fish and the rice for his cooking. He has also devoted much of his life towards the craft. I have recommended this documentary to many, many people and all of them have loved it...five stars. 12/31/2012
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is very cool and it is a game of thinking and my brother likes it to he said it is also a thinking game.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the way this book picked right up where the Hunger Games left off.  The ending was something that was something one wouldn't have expected.  Great book!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Thought it would be boring......it's addicting! I can't put it down. Three levels done quickly. I'll be up all night!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|fun to play and fun to create an aquarium! I'm addicted! I can't put it down. it's fun to see how much money I've earned to see what I can buy next!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So sweet and it has a really good message to it. Absolutely love it . Good for any age group.
B0053O89YM|2.0|When I purchased this item, The Good Wife: The Third Season,  the item description stated NEW. After I received this DVD set and given as a Christmas gift I was informed it was very obvious that it was re packaged and used. The DVDs were not in proper order inside the case as new DVDs would be when factory packaged and some looked used/worn and scratched. I,m very disappointed with this transaction especially in being lied to. I also purchased Seasons One & Two from Amazon and they came as described, NEW....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed this book from the first to the last page! It was absolutely enlightening! The book counts as one of my best reads ever! Loved it! Thanks Colleen, the only problem now is I cannot subscribe it to my bookclub members yet, because they do not all have e readers yet! Have to do something about that! Lol!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like Mahjong games and this one is pretty good! Bright colors, calm music, easy to navigate and nice options. Lots of puzzels for a free app!
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My 5 year old grandson ask for the Tyrannosaurus Rex for Christmas. He is seriously into dinosaurs and specifically ask for this one. He is a typical 5 yr old boy and can play rough. The toy is made of a hard substance and has is surviving all he can put it through.<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars because of they way it is made, the attention to detail, which my 5 yr old pointed out since he has studied his dinosaur book extensively. My grandchildren have many animals made by Schleich and they retain their color and are well worth the cost.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Enjoys listening to the sounds of rain. It's very relaxing I fall asleep as soon as my head his the pillow.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I got tired of telling my sister about the escapades that go on in this series so I gave this set to her as a Christmas gift. She is excited. She has made a schedule to view them. I may even join her to watch some.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I received this flashlight as a gift and when I loaded the batteries and fired it up two words popped into my mind...\\"Thermo-Nuclear\\".  In Turbo-mode this puppy is retina burning bright, which is just what the doctor ordered. While I was looking for a good-dependable-all-around flashlight when I added this light to my \\"wish list\\" it now occupies a place on my bedside table where it serves the dual purpose of acting as a non-lethal deterrent in the event of a break in.  Seriously, you pop this light in someones face they are going -down-...at least long enough for you to dial 911.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Great game!  Feels and plays like the old Outrun game with some updated graphics, sound and driver battles. 5 stars.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Excellent!  A very different  perspective than most Holocaust victems.  We could learn much about ourselves as well as people in general about going forwars after tramatic experiences.  The ooones that searched for a reason to survive; did and those who gave up expired.  In view of the mess the world is in today, we need to be reminded to hold close those things  that matter if we are to not just survive, but to thriive.
1250006341|5.0|I gave this as a gift  to my sister who is a new fan of this show. She was so excited. She is enjoying reading it because it explains life, culture and (I guess) romance in that time and place. She always has some new tidbit to tell me about it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|About the best narrative, as told through a novel, of the complex causes that allowed Hitler and fascism to rise in Europe.  I learned so much about the USSR, Spain,  English.  Can't wait for for the third installment.
B000009HF2|5.0|It was so weird to have my teenage son ask me if I'd heard of this album, when it was one of my first albums, uh, just a year or 2 ago.  (more like 20+ years ago when I was in high school!)  He says it's so hard to find full versions of the songs online so he really wanted the whole CD, which he rarely needs to buy anymore.  He's extremely happy and listens to \\"Feel Like We Do\\" maybe as much as I used to : )  Judging by how much he plays it, I just have to give this 5 stars.  Plus, it's just a necessity in a classic rock lover's library.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|this is a great book I can't wait for book two the story and the characters were excelent but realy didn't like the way the book just stoped.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this for my parents (they love to play family games around Christmastime). It is an easy-to-learn, fun game for 2-4 players. The pieces are small and easy to lose, so I don't recommend this game for young kids.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG it was a VERY good book.....even though I read it without the kindle..........it was even better the second time!!!!!!!
B008DKBPTO|5.0|It was exactly what I needed for the new Kindle touch I got for Christmas.  It's even prettier in person.
B006O7XOOW|1.0|Neither of my 2 children (3yr and 7 mo) like this toy. It's very boring. You can find a more interesting toy at a better price. If I hadn't thrown the box away I would return it.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|...but the BD director's cut is really nothing special.  I honestly couldn't tell too much of a difference between the DVD with progressive scan and the Blu Ray.  On the other hand: Dark colours are darker so in a movie entitled &#34;Dark City&#34; this is a big deal...four stars.
B00164KYV4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and is like new. I love how it had not one scratch on it.
B00AQM85YK|1.0|The first 50 pages, or four chapters, are missing from this etext. I found another version without missing pages free on Amazon.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I never expected this book to go down the roads that it did but absolutely loved every last page of it!
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Such a page turner.  Something unexpected around every corner.  Gruesomely accurate and moving portrayal of addiction. I caught myself making strange faces during most of the read.  I loved it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This app works great on my acer iconia. It is very easy to use and a lot of useful books go on sale or are free everyday!
B003L16FAE|1.0|Item is in a format my blu-ray player does not recognize. I didn't spend enough money on it to warrant returning it so I will just eat it. Do NOT buy this product.
1609611543|5.0|This book explains the 'why' and 'how' avoiding genetically engineered food improves your overall health and trims excess fat from your body painlessly.  There is no hunger, yet the weight disappears.  Disease symptoms (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) decrease and/or disappear and energy levels increase.  It works!
