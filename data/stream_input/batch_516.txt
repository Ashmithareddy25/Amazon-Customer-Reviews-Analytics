1594200440|5.0|Having discussed it with several people who have read this book I am even more convinced that it works at several different levels. The first is the British-style comedy, the second is the old man's magnum opus on the history of tractors and the third is the past and continuing impact of the events in the former Soviet Union over the last century on all the main characters. This is seen from a Ukrainian perspective (with slavic dark humour), where Ukraine was not only the founding location of 'Rus' but later the bread basket of the Csarist and Soviet 'Russian' empires. These three levels run in and out of one another, just like real life and that is probably why several people have read the book at least twice. Those critics who have seen it primarily as a sexual farce make the mistake of not reading deeper. The beauty of the prose should lead them to do this, but it is such a page turner that I can understand why they might miss it.
0393038912|5.0|The central question of this book is simply this: why did western civilization come to dominate the world in the last few centuries instead of, say, the Chinese or the native Americans?  The simple answer to this question gives the title of this book (Europeans had guns, germs and steel) but that title is actually deceptive in terms of what Jared Diamond does in this book.  Though it's true that the Europeans guns, germs and steel allowed them to dominate beginning with the \\"era of exploration\\" starting with Columbus, Diamond recognizes these as proximate causes.  The primary causes are much deeper and much further back.<br /><br />It is difficult to summarize Diamond's very clever and well-researched assertions but he basically traces the success of western society to this primary cause: food production.  In the \\"fertile crescent\\" there were better and a wider variety of plants to domesticate as farming began.  This was supported by a better and wider variety of animals to domesticate which, in turn, led to more effective farming.  These domesticates spread easily along the east-west axis of Eurasia because of similarities in longitude often indicate similarities in climate.  This long presence of multiple domesticates gave rise to disease to which survivors evolved immunity but lay ready to devastate isolated populations.  And, ultimately, Europe had the incentive to progress because of divided rulers, countries and principalities than encouraged competition.<br /><br />Other areas that, at some point, could have been competitive had major strikes against them: a north-south axis (like Africa and the Americas) slowing the spread of even their limited domesticates.  Some areas (Australia, areas of Africa & the Americas) had so few domesticates that the people living there remained hunter-gatherers.  The limitation of domesticates also led to less animal-bred diseases and, therefore, immunities.  And, in countries like China, who could have been competitive with the West, were basically unified and politically stable enough that their incentive to progress was slowed.<br /><br />The previous two paragraphs do not do justice to this extraordinary work.  Like many works of genius, this book is a synthesis of ideas and information from various fields giving a comprehensive view of world development.  I have never read anything like it before and find it incredibly enlightening.  If there is a flaw in this book, it's that Diamond takes to much time to (rather plaintively) convince the reader that this is a work with value developed from scientific principles.  That should be obvious and it is sad that Diamond has to spend time outlining it.  Still, he realizes that his conclusions are subject to change based on future discoveries and new interpretations of old data but this is true of any scientific work.  That doesn't change that Mr. Diamond has written a book of brilliance that deserves to be read.the West, were basically unified and politically stable enough that their incentive to progress was slowed. <br /> <br />The previous two paragraphs do not do justice to this extraordinary work.

B0000X61VE|5.0|Despite some criticisms about doing a few of the exercises wrong on the DVD (I saw some minor excess body movements on leg swings which she does not say to do and the trainer corrects), I love this.  Released several years ago, this work out was ahead of the pack, if you ask me.  There are strength and Pilates-type moves integrated into this workout, which also elevates the heart rate somewhat as a bonus.  I think it's the perfect combination between lengthening/stretching type moves which studies show are quite productive, and traditional strength moves- also necessary to reduce body fat and tone up. In fact, I know of no other workout DVD (and I have many, many) which have this combination.  And it's so fun to do.  Not at all like watching an exercise guru and her pack workout in a boring studio.  It flips between the trainer putting her through the paces in a loft-type place, and her on top of a city building or on the beach.

B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is just great. I liked the previous 2 albums but they had more mellow songs in those. I believe this album is the best so far. Their music is really full of different sounds and they are trying to make something different that's why I like them. No comparison to U2 unlike other reviews. U2 is going downhill with their every latest album. If you think Speed of Sound is the best hit, believe it or not since I bought this album I didn't even listen to Speen of Sound once. My favorite song is White Shadows. Then comes Low, Square One, Let's Talk, Hardest Part. Absolutely great album!

B000A88EVE|4.0|David Bowie shows off some serious acting chops here. He delivers a very affecting portayal of an alien corrupted by humanity. The story is timeless and very thought provoking. If you haven't seen this movie I would recommend it.
0061015725|4.0|...if you enjoy a good solid Crichton novel.<br /><br />Prey has all the staples of Crichton's best work.  A good setting, great scientific background, and a quick pace.  Of course it also suffers the other typical problems with Crichton novels...weak characters, and the familiar prose of problem-hypothesis-scientific explanation-new problem (and repeat).<br /><br />The story focuses on nanotechnology (microscopic robots) and how they are let loose from a laboratory into the environment.  Naturally they begin to \\"prey\\" on anything they view as a threat and it's up to our computer-programming hero to come in and save the day.<br /><br />The book reads like it could someday be a big screen movie.  Overall I had fun with this book, not as good as Jurassic Park but better than Congo.
B00005JNZ4|4.0|I went into this movie slighly pessimistic, after all of the negative reviews I had read. However I must say I was pleasntly surprised, Must Love Dogs may be formulaic as some have said, but if you are like me and enjoy the formula you also should find this movie fun. I don't know why people complain so much about formula, if a formula works it works, ask the makers of coca cola. 13 Going on 30, You've Got Mail, Ever After, and Sabrina are other formula films but very enjoyable as well, I don't find in neccesary that every movie be earth shattering. The meaning of life is not infused in the threads of this film, but who cares! John Cusack is a delight to watch with just the right amount of manic humor. The supporting cast keeps the laughs consistant. I recommend this movie to fans of light hearted romantic comedies, and to any naysayers, if you don't like it don't watch it then.
B000301YY8|5.0|Fantastic!  I briefly heard one of the tracks off this CD while I was in Starbucks.  I was so impressed with the track I asked one of the employees who it was.  I went home and ordered the CD.  Now that I have it, I still cannot tell which song I had heard earlier as every song on the CD is equally as impressive.
B00003BDXG|2.0|Mtv style camerawork, excessive unnessary violence(coming from a die hard horror fan and a Clockwork Orange lover), and choppy storytelling bog this one down. Oliver Stone has done great films such as Platoon and Born on the 4th of July. He has made good films like The Doors and U-Turn, and then he has done misfires where he doesn't seem to be able to keep his focus, and this movie is a prime example. What was intended as a scathing commentary about the media glamorizing violence in itself ends up two things, glorifying it itself and a self parody. It is really a shame the performances in this film are brilliant, Woody Harrelson is the stand out, but Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Downy Jr. are really good as well. Perhaps if Stone hadn't just gone wild and spun the camera around, maybe he wouldn't have gotten so dizzy and lost direction.
B00004BZ16|4.0|I deleted my earlier review of this album where I called it self indulgent and full of filler. I reconsidered this once I went out and got the new remastered version - I previously had the triple album in junior high and quickly disregarded it as a load of crap. But a good friend of mine reminded me how much he liked it, so I got it again, this time on CD, thinking I might have been wrong. First of all the remaster SOUNDS INCREDIBLE. And  my reconsideration of the songs themselves changed once I listened to them with more mature ears. I have in the last 20 years grown to appreciate many different kinds of music, dub reggae being one example. And there a few really good reggae tunes on this double disc. Sure, it is still quite a mess. But a good mess. A stew, if you will. I see it as the post-punk equivelant of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Tusk.\\" So many bases are covered it's rather hard to digest in one sitting. Reggae, dance, sixties Motown -styled pop, funk, and for the fans, even a few old style standard Clash rockers. It's all here, folks. All you gotta do is find it. This is the kind compact disc that is perfectly suited for the \\"program\\" button on your player. Pick what you like, and play the hell out of it. I also, oddly enough, see the obvious influnece of this album on such post punk acts as the Cure, Siouxsie and the Banhsees and the Jam in that they abandoned the standard primitive \\"three chord thrash\\" of their earliest works in favor of a more varied approach. See for example the Cure's \\"the Lovecats\\", a lite cocktail jazz song, or the Banshees' \\"Swimming Horses\\", which is set to a waltz time. The Jam also flirted with Motown styled pop songs before disbanding. Remove the vocals from the songs on Sandanista! and you would never know it was the Clash. For those punk purists out there I'm sure that will sound offensive. To me it is brilliant, and yes, quite Magnificent. I now see this as an album the Clash recorded really more for themselves, to push some boundariesand see how people reacted to it. That in itself is about as \\"punk\\" as anything I can think of.
0792841344|4.0|4 and a half stars.<br /><br />This movie is really scary. Ever since I was a kid this movie always had a way of getting under my skin. The Tall Man scares me more than Freddy and Jason combined. He very much embodies death, not just some psycho hellbent on vengeance. He is without vengeance or discrimination, he is simply the embodiment of evil to humanity. This movie is highly inventive and still holds up well today. The original is still the best one, although I do like part 2 a lot. \\"If This One Doesn't Scare You, You're Already Dead.\\"
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I admit the FIRST time I saw this movie it was \\"why am I watching this bizarre movie?\\".  But after the second and third time I GOT IT !  I think about scenes while at work and laugh out loud. I'm going to buy this movie for my home library.
B00007LTIG|4.0|In My opinion, this was the very best of all of their albums. JG's rendition of Morning Due is unsurpassed by anyone including Robert Plants. Just a great song in a great album. I would have given it 5 stars but I don't care for some of the 'bonus tracks' that have been included.
B000067J1I|5.0|This movie is funny sad and smart.....It will make you want to be a kid again....Great Movie!!!!!!!

B00003CX95|5.0|After 750 reviews posted here (so far), what else new could I say?  I read about 50 of them and heard it all (including some anti-Gibson anger).  Just posting my vote for my all-time favorite film.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|There really is nothing like the first time. And the first time we ever saw a full length animated feature on the big screen was Walt Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the classic story of a princess who goes to live with seven men (she's not easy by the way) who have serious problems with growth.<br /><br />The animation is brilliant, as are the songs which are equally fairy tale like. Having seen this film many many times I have found it to be lots of fun, but also now a little dated. I know I could be committing blasphemy by saying this about the amazing achievement of Snow White, but after seeing it so many times it seems tired...<br /><br />- That was until this 2-Disc Platinum Edition DVD came out. The animation and sound is perfectly remastered, giving it a whole new lease of life. The DVD has the ultimate selection of special features for Snow White fans- too many for me to be bothered to list right now, but trust me you won't be disappointed. This is the best effort to date from Disney DVD and is extraordinarily highly recommended.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|I went and saw Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle in the theatre and I have to say it did not so much achieve my expectations as utterly defy and exceed them.  <br /> <br />On Stephen Chow's films... <br />Stephen Chow is the master of Kung Fu Comedies. His distinctive style of absurd/cartoony violence and action sequences are portrayed in a world requiring a bit more suspension of disbelief than might normally be expected, but I assure you it's well worth the minimal effort. Shao-Lin Soccer, being perhaps the closest of Mr. Chow's movies in comparison to visual style with Kung Fu Hustle, pales in comparison to the action and computer assisted special effects we were offered up in this latest movie. <br /> <br />On general ballsy-ness...  <br />I saw opening the movie with it's original Chinese soundtrack and English subtitles as a pretty ballsy move on the part of the producers and distributors.  <br />Looking at the mainstream success of movies like Crouching Tiger/Hidden Dragon and HERO it might not seem like such a stretch, but you should also keep in mind that Kung Fu Hustle is being billed as an action/comedy. To my knowledge, no film in that genre has ever seen a general release to theaters in a foreign language and the great thing about this film is that it's meant for the general audience not an \\"art house\\" minority of critics and film snobs.  <br />I was really praying for this movie to be well received at the box office in the U.S., but I'm sure Stephen Chow will be able to continue making his movies regardless of the outcome.   <br /> <br />On director Stephen Chow's genius...  <br />One of the visual storytelling devices that I wanted to comment on was at the end of the film. The climax of action and story had culminated and there was this heavy sense of what had just happened, then the film cuts to a scene outside a candy store where more resolution is going to take place and to wrap up some loose ends. In the midst of this dramatic heaviness we see a running gag, some guy with his butt hanging out of his pants, and the mood shifts back to comedy. The ease with which this final scene plays out is truly brilliant.  <br /> <br />If you haven't seen it yet and are looking for something funny and different to pick up your spirits, I beg you to go see this movie and support the popularity of his films.  <br /> <br />(most of which you can find pretty cheap new & used on Amazon) <br />
0895260131|5.0|As one that taught world religions in college for many years I think that Mr. Spencer has done both laymen and academics alike, a great service. He has done this by helping us focus on the primary documents from which the doctrine of Jihad was spawned. From my viewpoint there is very little spin and an important emphasis on facts. <br /> <br />As you read the volume four things become both manifest and reinforced to the reader. <br /> <br />1) Muhammad was at heart a warlord pure and simple. He and his followers sought land, power and conquest from the beginning. <br />2) Apart from the contradictory essence of the Koran it, in fact, teaches the extermination of infidels that refuse to submit. (any non-believer) <br />3) The concept of truth is found to be \\"self serving\\" in the Muslim way of thinking. (This is opposed to the notion of \\"self evident\\" truth found in biblical Christianity). <br />4) Islam is the only major world religion that teaches its followers that killing is a virtue. <br /> <br />To read this volume with a heart and mind that wishes to learn is, in my opinion, time well spent.
038097617X|4.0|Having read Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married, I really enjoy this author's tone and style of writing.  She writes with a witty and unique style.  I love how she capitalizes the names of her emotions (\\"Jealousy\\", \\"Common Sense\\", as if each is a character in her head that arrives on the scene).<br /><br />Claire is a likable character, and I found it difficult to put the book down when my school age children came home.  I wanted to see what would happen next, and who would be the next recipient of her sharp tongue.<br /><br />Marian Keyes typically writes about characters with poor self esteem, and this book is no different.  I give Claire a lot of credit for learning so much about herself and becoming a stronger person. I kept rooting for her to pull herself together and give her unfaithful husband a piece of her mind.  I couldn't STAND the jerk.  MEN!!!!<br /><br /> I gave the book 4 stars because it was a bit hard to get into in the first quarter of the book, maybe, but it ultimately was a page turner.  Enjoy!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I have to say this aural treat is as inventive and refreshing as all the hype indicates. I find myself repeating certain snippets of songs just to relive the intense emotional high they inspire. Who needs Superman anyway...
B00005JMUA|1.0|I'm not terribly surprised that the Kill Bill's were a disaster. The classic example was Dennis Hopper's elevation to zietgeist guru after 'Easy Rider' only to rapidly fall after being shipped off to Peru with a budget to play it again, Sam. The self indulgent results were the stuff of legend. Lumbered with a fiasco to rival Norman Mailer's 'Tough Guy's Don't Dance', the studio rightly calculated Kill Bill Vol 2 would have a sufficient fan base to be worth releasing and the die hards would pronounce it a masterpiece anyway. It has made money. Those of you who went to 'Reservoir Dogs' expecting to see 'an amazing, pumping powerhouse of a movie' (as the billing boasted) only to be confronted with a filmed stage play of tedious verbosity, will not be dismayed by the last quarter of Vol 2, which makes boredom almost an art form. I suspect the director is aware of this and took the CSI job to prove to the industry that he could do disciplined work with someone else's script.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I'm gonna keep this review short, because many of the other reviews cover the details. This is the best piece of animation seen on screen- ever! It has no worthy rival. And the DVD does it justice with its wide selection of special features. Still, for some reason I always get bored watching Fantasia. For some reason, every time I watch it I find some reason to leave the room or fall asleep. I guess the feast that is Fantasia can be a little overwhelming. Still, if you do manage to stay focused on this Walt Disney Masterpiece, you really will enjoy the sheer brilliance of Disney's art.
B00005RYKV|4.0|Kitano's first (and only) feature film foray into English language territory, BROTHER may be Kitano at his simplest, but most certainly at his coolest - since Hana Bi, anyway.<br /><br />Kitano plays a disgraced Yakuza foot soldier whose extreme behaviour sees him exiled in the US, where his younger brother lives. Kitano starts his new life exactly where his old life left of - with extreme violence.<br /><br />This is Kitano at the height of his self-destructive performances. Separated from his \\"family\\", adrift in a banal culture, with little understanding of the language, his fast and fiery rise to power is bested only by his rapid decline.<br /><br />One gripe: when are we going to see more features - particularly commentaries - on Kitano DVDs. Even ZATOICHI is barren of such DVD basics.
B0007MVXQG|4.0|A solid comeback from the priest (who knew?)-if you are here means you know what to expect and you will find it on the CD. Highlights are the 10min epic Lochness, which may as well have been stolen from Iron Maiden's next album, and the short but frightening Eulogy. I dare you to forget that guitar hook, in its macabre simplicity. Pure class
0765348780|4.0|I have to agree that this is similar stuff to Martin, and not quite as good. But this is great entertainment while we wait on Mr. Martin to publish the next book already!<br /><br />Honestly I found the first third of this book to be confusing and overly focused on bloody battles. However, as the story progresses it mellows into a delightful concoction of interesting characters and complex motivations. By the end of this book I was having trouble putting it down. That's the good news!<br /><br />The not so good news is that I was still having some trouble keeping all of the characters straight at the end of the book. There are an incredible number of characters in this book, a few too many IMHO. I would like to see a few less characters and a little more depth.<br /><br />This is not a book for people who want a nice easy read with obvious villains and heroes. Many characters switch sides, and its not entirely obvious which side is the good guys. There are several forces at work here and not all of them have clearly understood objectives; at least not by us mortals! I rather enjoy many shades of gray so I see this as a good thing.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a remarkably good book from an author who is showing great potential. I happened on it during a cruise after I finished the book I brought with me so I didn't expect much. This was a very pleasant surprise for a random purchase. If the next books get better then I must say that old Georgey boy will have some stiff competition on his hands!

B0000JCFPE|4.0|If you've seen Paul Verhoeven's other non sci-fi satire movies than you might have been more prepared and possibly less interested than me.  It was the first non-sci-fi Verhoeven movie that I've seen, ranking above Hollowman and below Total Recall in my Verhoeven list.  We even get a famous Verhoeven gunshot squib shot!  It's just one gunshot, but hey it splatters and is remenicent of RoboCop and Total Recall.  Anyway, Michael Douglas and Sharon Stone are both excellent players and are very fun to watch play out their scenes, and not just the nudy ones.  This may have alot of sex in it, but if you know Verhoeven you already knew that.  Every one of his movies that I've seen directed by him show boobs, but that's not the point of this movie even though it may seem like that at times.  This movie kept me guessing up until literally the very ending credits.  The suspense is very good and helps move this movie along at a good pace.  I found this to be a very addictive movie to watch, and by that I mean I didn't want it to be over.  I know what you're thinking, and that's not my reason.  The only problem with this is the outdated DVD.  It's a piece of crap from the early days of DVD.  See this movie if you're a Verhoeven fan.  Don't show your kids though.

B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes are probably one of the best artists making music today.  Along with Ryan Adams, Coldplay, Josh Ritter, John Mayer and David Gray, they prove to music fans that there really IS people out there who still make music for the music, not for the image, glitz and glamour of the 'biz'.  They're hip, they're indie, they have creativity, spark, great hooks and HOT guitar licks.  The 'Stripes' are a smack in the face to anyone who thinks that people like Ashlee Simpson qualify as 'rock' music.  Finally there is an album that is truly musical.  &quot;Elephant&quot; is a classic album, one of the few of this decade, and no music fan should be without it.
0375815260|4.0|This is the world that we dream of as children. The characters are wildly imaginative and keep you entertained from beginning to end. A definite on the must read list.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a show that took me completely by surprise.  I was a hardcore Buffy/Angel fan back in the day and loved almost anything they put out, so I loved to see Joss and then the other executive producers and writers put new stuff out.   <br /> <br />I finally got around to watching Wonderfalls a few months back and I loved it, so I figured that I would eventually get around to seeing Joss's new baby, Firefly.  However, I had seen one episode back during Fox's hack and slash airings of the show and didn't really care for it too much, so I wondered whether or not I would even get through the entire box set.  Let me tell you up front that it was no problem at all. <br /> <br />Firefly is set in the future after a great war between the Alliance and the Independents.  The Alliance was the corporate and government conglomerate that formed to rule our part of the universe.  In this world, food and medicine are the silver and gold of today.  Everyone is still constantly expanding to new worlds so these things will fetch a pretty penny. <br /> <br />Who will get these things to the people you ask.  None other than Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew aboard the spaceship Firefly. <br /> <br />If you are not a big fan of Sci-Fi, don't let the whole spaceship thing bother you.  This is more western than it is sci-fi.  The captian carries a six shooter and more than once they get into good old fashion gun fights.   <br /> <br />The best part, though is the characters and the little things that you begin to love.   <br /> <br />You start with Mal, the man that has been hurt by everyone and has a hard time opening up, but will do anything to protect his crew. <br /> <br />Next is Zoe, his tough as nails second who is always with him in a fight and is second in command on the ship.  She deals with the constant struggle between being their for her captain and her husband. <br /> <br />Who happens to be the pilot of the ship.   Hoban, was the third person on board the ship and eventually fell in love with Zoe.  He is a bit of a goofball, but is responsible for all of their lives everyday.  However, he is not very good in a fight, so he tends to leave that to his wife. <br /> <br />Next is one of my favorite characters, Kaylee, acts and talks like allot like a Southern girl of today.  She also has a gift of being able to sense what is going on with the ship and what it needs to continue to run.  This helps allot since it seems to be held together MacGyver style with chewing gum and baseball cards.  She really is the heart of the crew. <br /> <br />The final member of the crew at the beginning of the show is Jayne.  He is a mercenary through and through, always out to make a buck and not letting anything stop him to do it.  However, as the season progresses he beging little by little to see his shipmates as more of a family. <br /> <br />We then get a few passengers that hang on for a bit.  There is Book, the Shepherd(preacher) who we find out will be far more than we will know, Simon who is a Doctor that smuggled his sister on board in cryogenic stasis, and his sister River who was a supergenius until the government started cutting on her brain, now she's more than a bit crazy and a bit psychic as well. <br /> <br />This was a show that I began to like from the beginning, but only a bit.  However, as I continue to watch it grew on me until I couldn't wait to see the last few.  By that time, I was hooked... a fiend that needed my fix, but alas the show was canceled after only 15 episodes were made.  I was left with so many question that I hope at least a few of which will be answered in the film Serenity.  However, I am hoping with all of my might that the brass will realize what a great thing it was that they canceled and go the Family Guy route and pick it back up.
074322454X|5.0|This book is one of the most moving works I have ever read.  Stephen Ambrose has a great way of drawing the reader into the story.  You laugh, cry, and feel the anger right along side of those brave men.  Stephen Ambrose has done a wonderful service to those brave men.  This book really helps younger generations understand thier Parents, Grandparents and in some cases Great-Grandparents.  I would recommend this book to anybody, young and old alike!
B000002ACR|5.0|Kick off David Crosby's \\"Mind Gardens\\" and replace it with his \\"Lady Friend\\" and you have not only the Byrds' best album, but one that stands up against most Beatles or Stones albums from the Sixties. Seems like a no-brainer today, but at the time the Byrds were obviously having difficulty with the talented but stubborn, and often wrongheaded, Mr. Crosby. It's too bad because he was writing some of his best songs during this period.<br /><br />One of the main attractions to Younger Than Yesterday for me is the contribution of Chris Hillman. Although you never read about it in all the volumes written about \\"country rock\\" and it's origins (with credit alternately given to Gram Parsons, The International Submarine Band, Poco, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Rick Nelson, Michael Nesmith, even Roger McGuinn), this album, and Hillman's songs in particular, seems to be the real starting point. Or, at least one of the starting points. After all, a lot of what is called country rock, like the later Sweetheart of the Rodeo, was actually country songs (and some folk) performed by a rock band, rather than a real hybrid, like the Hillman songs here. My favorite song on Younger Than Yesterday is \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" but the whole album (almost) is great.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Only someone so hard-hearted and cold could not be moved by the haunting melodies and heatbreaking lyrics on 'O', an album which to me, represents the bare bones of romance and loss.  Damien Rice has a wonderful, piercing voice which delivers true, passionate, realistic, raw emotion.  He sells his own songs so naturally, so beautifully, that it is almost impossible to not get immersed into this CD's clear, palpable feelings.  It's romantic and sad without being corny.  It's melodic and instrumental without being over-produced.  It's emotional without being cliche.  'O' has it all.  It is one of the best albums ever recorded.
B00000JFV9|5.0|This album is a  certified. No wonder it's embraced a bit more than the movie. This album is not onhly definitive street music for the 1970's but for many generations to follow. I guess it's true what Slim Charles said to Cutty when he was addressing him on the current state of the dope game on The Wire(HBO). HE SAID THE GAME AIN'T CHANGED IT GOT MORE FIERCE. That explains the timelessness of this album because no matter how many new rules or people come into the dope game year after year it's still the same. As long as it's still cats on the grind(pushin' dope) in every hood around world, this album will never lose it's relevance.  The superfly soundtrack represents depictions of a drug dealers lifestyle down to a tee.<br /><br />What I love about this album is that it manages to clearly capture the true essence of street life without the bragdaccio of Gangster Rap nor the preachiness of Afrocentric Rap of the late 80's and early 90's. Instead it balances both without drifting too deep into one dimension while. Even when Curtis gets a bit heavy handed with his anti drug message(No Thing On Me-Cocaine song) the music still has a authenic feel.  All in All this soundtrack is Superfly and if you lose out on this masterpiece, don't ask no questions why!
B0000AKY7R|5.0|Carlos Santana and John Mclaughlin are some of the great guitarist in are time and these two coming together for the love of Chinmoy and spirtiual following make one of the best guitar fusion albums out there. With the much covered Love Supreme coming first this one is probably the best. The bass line is think and keeps the whole thing together while the two guitar deut and throw ideas out to each other. The great Larry Young offers some great organ with that two hand chord tapping techniquie that makes the song even more spacey. Naima another Coltrane song brings us back to earth with calm relaxing acostic guitars swirling around. The fast pace A Lift Divine is next and when I say fast that even sounds to slow with the bass spitting out lines like a machine gun. The song has some spritual hippy vocals that take away from it but the solos and drumming by Billy Cobham pay-off. Let Us Go To the House of the Lord has a Al deMeola feel to it. The song is very melodelic and lush. Sometimes you dirft away from it but it is still a great track. <br />The outtake track I don't really listen to them but A Love Supreme has a longer organ solo and less drums and Naima just sounds the same no big difference. Highly Recomended.

B00005T7I1|5.0|If you expect an action flick you will be disappointed. It should never have been promoted that way, and that may be partly Warren's fault.<br /><br />The truth is that this movie is a witty, silly, charming, lovely romantic fantasy of a stylized world, and the apparent ricketiness and quaintness of the scenery is, I believe, intentional.<br /><br />The songs are all Sondheim; that's Mandy Patinkin playing 88 Keys; and if Bernadette Peters had played Breathless, we all would have known what we were looking at and judged accordingly.<br /><br />Maybe it's a little slow now, but come to this film with the right expectations and you will be rewarded.<br /><br />(Watch for Al Pacino saying, \\"I tested them and they flunked.  Now they're just flunkies . . . \\")

B000A2H812|4.0|I love fusion bands, and I always have. When multiple styles click together and create a new, vivid hybrid, then there's no other sound like it in the world.<br /><br />That's also a good description of Gogol Bordello's third full-length album, \\"Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike\\" -- a mad mixture of gypsy, punk, reggae, Latin and who knows what else. It's more than a little insane, as it spins without warning from one style to the next. But the energy and spirit make that a good kind of insanity.<br /><br />It opens with staccato snarls and unpolished fiddle playing in \\"Sally,\\" before exploding into a streak of frenetic punk music. Just when it seems that they have settled into a signature style, they kick into \\"Immigrant Punk,\\" which is best described as rock played with fiddle and accordion.<br /><br />Eugene Hutz has the right amount of punk sneer that you'd expect for such music, but he also doesn't seem to be taking himself seriously. He fits into metal-tinged rockers, gypsy dance music, and a bunch of other genre-straddling song styles.<br /><br />In a nutshell, don't expect any of this to sound like... anything you've ever heard.<br /><br />Frontman Hutz -- who stars in the much-anticipated \\"Everything Is Illuminated,\\" adapted from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel -- seems to be spreading his colourful personality all over the music. Exhibit A: lyrics as wild and insane as the music. Example: \\"Start wearin' purple for me now/all your sanity and wits/they will all vanish/I promise!\\" Okay, Eugene, whatever you say!<br /><br />Hutz also provides the frenetic percussion and some of that equally energetic guitar. And he's backed by Yuri Lemeshev's accordion and Sergey Ryabtzev's violin, which add a folksy flair. It's a very weird sound, but Gogol Bordello manages to balance it out between the gypsy-Slavic sound, and the punk energy.<br /><br />The title of \\"Gypsy Punks Underdog World Strike\\" pretty much describes the album itself -- a mad, wild, colourful patchwork of different sounds and styles. Refreshingly weird and original.iginal.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I'm a huge Harry Connick, Jr. fan, and I heard this guy's voice and was intrigued by the similarity.  However, at closer review, I realized that where Harry is N'awlin's jazzy, Michael is Sinatra classy, and it's nice to have a change.  This album is even better than his first (which was great), and I can't stop listening to it.  The duet with Nelly Furtado was not good, but everything else was highly enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who likes smooth big band sound!
B00005ASGG|5.0|&#34;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance&#34; (1962) rightly takes its place among the great Westerns. Though not his last film, &#34;Liberty Valance&#34; was director John Ford's final masterwork and a melancholy epitaph to the genre he nurtured. The iconic casting of James Stewart and John Wayne — with effective support from Lee Marvin, Vera Miles, Edmund O'Brien, Woody Strode and Andy Devine —  lends emotional power to Ford's elegiac depiction of the civilized frontier. A haunting valedictory and an integral work in cinema history.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|How can you really top Gavin's hit single \\"I DON'T WANNA BE\\"?  Along with KELLY CLARKSON's \\"SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE,\\" it's easily one of the top pop-rock songs of 2005-05, where the addictive chorus, raw arrangements, plaintive vocals, and perfect pop songcraft all come crashing together.  While the album CHARIOT doesn't match this one song, surprisingly, Gavin offers up at least a handful of great introspective tracks, from JUST FRIENDS to FOLLOW-THROUGH to the title track, etc.  I am not surprised Gavin was signed to J Records, as CLIVE DAVIS always knows how to sign stellar singer-songwriters.  Unlike a lot of pre-fab/calculated dross masquerading as music, it's highly refreshing to hear AUTHENTIC talent this unvarnished, especially on the cool BONUS acoustic disc.  I look forward to see what Gavin delivers next...and how many other pop wannabees can you say that about?!
B000092ZYX|2.0|When I first bought it I was abler to listen to it to \\"Punch up at the wedding\\". Now it just annoys me, I can't get past \\"backdrifts\\". This album is so g**damn self-indulgent. It's like Radiohead think that they rule the world and anything they do is genius.They are so, so, so wrong. In \\"Hail to the Thief\\", Thom Yorke is such a boring singer, and Johnny Greenwood has no talent. This would have to rank high in the overrated albums of 2003.  Structurally, it sees Radiohead dwelling in dry unevolving \\"OK Computer\\" melodies. you'll find heavy political or appocallyptic rehashed lyrics such as \\"we can wipe you out anytime\\" \\"you tried but there was nothing we could do\\" \\"there is no way out it's too late now\\"  and unbearable \\"Kid A\\" or \\"Amnesiac\\" bloops and bleeps. You wish someone would just blow up that synth, I swear. \\"Sit down stand up\\" and \\"backdrfits\\" are perfect examples of this. This album is not worth purchasing. Another album like this and Radiohead is officially dead. The only good songs are the anthemic \\"there there\\" the soft gorgeous \\"I will\\" and maybe \\"A punch up at the wedding\\" but the rest is boring or pointless, really.
B0000028M7|5.0|Clearly nothing more needs to be said about the incredible content of this profoundly dark album--other reviewers have summed it up aptly and then some. Some of the lesser-known facets of this album are what carry it from Classic to Masterpiece status, however. Tracks 7 through 13 should be listened to in the sequence they appear on the album, since they can tell Layne's drug addiction story. It begins with the satisfaction and bravado of \\"Junkhead.\\" What follows: the self-disgust and dirtyness of \\"Dirt,\\" the denial-mixed-with-panic of \\"Godsmack.\\" (just look at the lyrics, \\"What in god's name have you done/ stick your arm for some real fun\\").  <br /> <br />After the \\"Dream Sequence\\" track, it seems that all hell breaks loose in the drug-addiction story. \\"Hate to feel,\\" is about the creation of a horrible second self that heroin has done to Layne--he sees and feels exactly what he's become, and he hates it. Next, in \\"Angry Chair,\\" though the lyrics are still dark and depressing, it seems that Layne is beginning to accept his new state (\\"stomach hurts and I don't care\\"...\\"I don't mind, yeah\\"). <br /> <br />The last track, \\"Would?\\" becomes the best in this drug-addiction song sequence, especially when considering the ending that Layne's life will eventually reach. It's written solely by guitarist Jerry Cantrell, so the lyrics are somewhat different than the rest of the sequence, but it still fits, especially the chorus. Layne sings (incredibly powerfully, I might add) of the horrible feeling of knowing that one has crossed the line and that there's no turning back. At the same time, he's calling for understanding, saying that he knows exactly what he's done and what's going to happen next, and that we can help him if we would. <br /> <br />Now, all of this is just my theory about another reason that makes this album amazing, not necessarily what I think the actualy meanings of the songs themselves are. I just think it's really cool how this works out, and I'm sure it was at least partially intentional on AIC's part. In summary, incredible album by itself, and even more interesting with a second listen!
B00082IJ08|1.0|This review may affend some but i have got to say it the Gorillaz's this is not music this is some kind of 7 year old music project gone sour. Come on lets face it the Gorillaz have yet to make a album that anybody likes  so why would this be any diffrent sure the other cd Gorillaz had \\"Clint Eastwood\\" on it big deal but was there any song that was cool i didnt think so. So that cd didnt sell so what do they do they make another crappy cd. And call it what DEMON DAYS why? I tell you why because the Gorillaz's are monkeys confused little monkeys that have no sence what so ever. <br />This is a plee do not buy this album PLEASE.
6305535264|2.0|I remember thumbing through OMNI Magazine (remember it?) circa 1979 and looking at cool sci-fi stills from SATURN 3 - but alas, since it was Rated R at the time, I couldn't go - but now, thanks to the miracle of DVD, I can finally sit down and watch it in all its..er..um...glory.  This is simply awful. Dreadful. Abysmal. I mean, really, you watch the screen in disbelief and think: STANLEY DONEN directed this?  Famed UK novelist MARTIN AMIS wrote this?  Legendary composer ELMER BERNSTEIN scored this?  KIRK DOUGLAS and HARVEY KEITEL appear in this?  The mind boggles.  FARRAH is, well, Farrah - certainly no worse than SOMEBODY KILLED HER HUSBAND, but not as good as her cameo in LOGAN'S RUN, a much, much better sci-fi flick.  I give this DVD two stars only for the rather innovative production design (other reviewers have pointed out how THE MATRIX ripped-off the \\"port\\" concept, and JAMES CAMERON obviously stole whole sequences for this later sci-fi actioners), but the film as a whole is trite, dull, flat, and finally, ridiculous. And don't get me started on the amateurish, shoddy SPX - hard to believe this movie came out two years AFTER \\"Star Wars\\" - and a year after \\"Alien\\"?!  Hello?! Utterly fake, the effects look more like shoestring SFX from '50s/'60s industrial films. Not scary at all, it's more kitsch and campy, so worth a peek or a rental at the very least.  And tossing in the original trailer is fun to watch all over again.
B000777J2S|4.0|This album has had the same emotional impact on me that Otis Redding's track Sitting by the Dock of the Bay had on me 40 years ago. The allusions by other reviewers to Nina Simone and Nick Cave are accurate. I would ask the author of the August 4th one star review to give this CD another listen. I am very glad I bought this recording. At the right time and in the right atmosphere it is a sublime musical experience.
B0002OERI0|4.0|At first I was reluctant to buy this CD. People are sayin Green Day are changing. Well I bought it anyway. True, its not better than their earlier albums. But its not bad. Actually, I think it's pretty good. (Although I would reccommend \\"Nimrod\\")And yes, they have changed, but I don't think the change is necesarily BAD... Well here's the track list for \\"American Idiot\\" and my ratings: <br /> <br />American Idiot - 10/10 - Great song, very catchy, but gets boring after a while, since its so overplayed. Anyway, it definately deserves 10 stars. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia - 8/10 - good song, with 5 parts. The melody rapidly changes at the beginning of each new part. <br /> <br />Holiday - 1000000/10 - BEST SONG EVER! <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 8/10 - another overplayed song. Kinda slow. <br /> <br />Are We Waiting - 8/10 - another slower song. Good catchy lyrics. <br /> <br />St. Jimmy - 9/10 - faster, better. Great melody, lyrics. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine - 7/10 - another slower song. Not as good as the previous tracks, but worth listening to. <br /> <br />She's a Rebel - 8/10 - good song. Great guitar riffs. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl - 6/10 - this is where the songs get worse. <br /> <br />Letterbomb - 9/10 - great oppening. Faster, good song. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends - 8/10 - probably the slowest song on the CD, unlike anything Green Day had ever done before. But its not bad. <br /> <br />The Death Of St. Jimmy - 6/10 - like the Jesus of Suburbia, it is made up of 5 parts, and a long song. Probably the worse song on the album. <br /> <br />Overall, it is a good CD. I would start out with Nimrod or Dookie if you are new to Green Day though.
B000002H33|1.0|I just finished listening to this album all the way through, and for my own benifit, I would like to clean the puke off the keyboard before writig my review. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Okay, that's better. <br />Here, we get introduced to \\"Metallica\\".  Judging by their name, I get the idea that they really want to be metal.  Sad to say, they come nowhere close to metal.  All they are is pop garbage with some guitar solos thrown in.  And why the hell does it cost so much, and only to get 8 songs? <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Disposable Heros\\" show the decline of modern music.  Apparantly record companies no longer review a song before relesing it.  Maybe if they did, they would have removed this garbage from the industry before it even got there. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Battery\\" and \\"Orion\\" show that this garbage band can't think of any ideas.  A song about Duracell, and an instrumental.  Please make it stop!!! <br /> <br />Overall, I would say that if you are looking into buying this album, you should also look into sticking your head in the toilet after taking a long, smelly s***.  Thank you.
B00003CX97|5.0|War films dont get better than this. Top-notch acting, authentic atmosphere and a brilliant script add up to grand adventure and powerful human drama. Both Holden and Guinness (who won Oscar) are memorable, as is Sessue Hayakawa, as the tough-but-honorable Japanese commander.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|\\"Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow\\" is NOT for everyone. A very narrow \\"niche\\" audience, which admittedly includes me, will find it marvelous, fantastic, and awe-inspring, in a yearning, nostalgic way. Other viewers may or may not enjoy it. <br />   A simple test for would-be viewers of this film might be: are you a fan of \\"Metropolis,\\" \\"King Kong\\" (the original), and early science fiction and fantasy films? Does Forrest J Ackerman's \\"Famous Monsters Of Filmland,\\" and, more importantly, his magazine \\"Spacemen,\\" hold a special place in your heart?  <br />   If your answer to these questions is \\"yes,\\" then I recommend \\"Sky Captain...\\" to you in a degree relative to your enthusiasm for those subjects. <br />   Those expecting neatly-tied explanations and a \\"modern\\" film will probably be disappointed, as many apparently have been. But if you have a sense of nostalgia and have not lost your sense of innocent wonder as a child of what Ackerman dubbed the \\"Imagi-Nation,\\" then you will be rewarded by \\"Sky Captain...\\" with a payoff virtually unequalled in \\"modern\\" filmmaking. <br />   And lest you think me a hopeless traditionalist, let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed the recent Spielberg/Tom Cruise version of \\"War Of The Worlds,\\" and found it significantly more enjoyable than the \\"sacred\\" George Pal/Gene Barry version of the 50s. <br />   The art direction and the overall \\"look\\" and atmosphere of \\"Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow\\" harkens back to a more innocent time. I love the look of Fritz Lang's \\"Metropolis,\\" and the recent Kino Video DVD restoration of that film made me feel I had never truly seen it before. \\"Sky Captain...\\" fed a hunger within me for more of that look. If I designed a world, it would look exactly like \\"Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow\\"! <br />   (Fans of this movie should also check out \\"Immortel A.V.\\", aka \\"Immortal,\\" for more computer-generated sci-fi/fantasy worlds.)
B000002KB8|5.0|This is a great CD, no doubt about it. Since 1970, Black Sabbath have been the kings of metal. Featurning Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler, Bill Ward and Tony Iommi, this is where metal took birth. I would reccommend this CD to any rock or metal fan. Its a classic. (although my favorite from Sabbath is \\"Paranoid\\".) <br /> <br />Black Sabbath - 10/10 - a masterpiece, starting out with the sounds of rain and lightning, soon adding church bells in the distance. Suddenly we hear Ozzy's voice and heavy guitar riffs. Awesome.  <br /> <br />Wizard - 8/10 - a great song. Featurning a little more of Ozzy's harmonica. <br /> <br />Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/bassically/NIB - 9/10 - yet another good song. Its made up of 4 parts, all of which have a differend sound to em. Its pretty good. <br /> <br />Wicked World - 10/10 - my favorite from the CD, its features good vocals from Ozzy and great guitar riffs. <br /> <br />Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning - 9/10 - like Wasp, it has several parts to it, and its longer than the other songs. Its great. <br /> <br />To sum all this up, this Cd rocks. As I said before you must be crazy if you don't own this already. I highly reccommend it.
B00005ATQF|5.0|Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" is a classic film of the war genre and what can be said about Lee Ermey? His part as the DI is done well...true to form, especially since he served as a Marine DI way back in the day.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Seventy-five years after release, this picture still delivers chills thanks to Lugosi's eerie presence and the stark, ominous atmosphere created by ditector Browining and team. One of the more visually striking early black and white films you'll see. A horror classic is for the ages.
0142004235|5.0|The characters, the scenes, the descriptions- - all so natural- - are brilliantly brought to life in this American literature classic that seems to recreate a true-life documentary about Central California at the turn-of-the century.  <br /> <br />With a straightforward story populated by a variety of characters, this book tells the saga of two families, the Trasks and the Hamiltons. The style somewhat resembles James Michener's in terms of his talent also to quickly acquaint you with locations and characters and put you on a first-name basis with them. The saga brings you into the lives of the characters and stirs your emotions like a mixer running on high-speed. Have you uncontrollably screamed out loud when reading a book? Well, I did at this one because of Kate (Cathy), who makes your blood boil with rage. <br /> <br />Although Kate doesn't take honors as the main character, she does steal the show in my eyes. She is the essence of e-v-i-l, a four-letter word in her case. Kate is the most memorable character because of her cunning, lying, scheming, and wicked personality, which is not easily forgotten. Steinbeck first talks of monsters as a way of introducing Kate. Monsters, he says, can be born through no fault of their own from human parents and defined through deformities such as huge heads, tiny bodies, no arms, no legs, etc. But then he asks, \\"... just as there are physical monsters, can there not be mental or psychic monsters born?\\" This didn't fully click in my mind at the time I read it because I hadn't witnessed Kate in action. It's after she starts her series of sinister deeds that you come to realize the significance of what Steinbeck meant by \\"psychic monster\\". You'll love to hate her. <br /> <br />Among the characters, the two with the best heads on their shoulders were Abra and Lee who added a touch of class by stating common-sense facts in such matter-of-fact fashion. They showed unfaltering determination to deal with life's hard knocks by takingthem by the horns, seeking practical solutions in the same down-to-earth way that would grab a sack of potatoes and start peeling. <br /> <br />I know some people have criticized the book, saying the two brothers, Cal and Aron, parallel and trivialize the biblical Cain and Abel. They commented that the story is too trite, pat, and overly simplistic in symbolizing \\"good versus evil\\". Maybe I am at fault since I try not to construe too much symbolism into every book I read, as in this instance. I took this story at face value and for that reason the \\"good versus evil premise\\" and the \\"Cain and Abel Story\\" never crossed my mind. In the end I was rewarded with a thoroughly entertaining story that I highly recommend. <br />
B00008NRL8|5.0|This set will virtually defy you not to dance.  And not bore you like those schmaltzy-slick old bandleaders' stuff.  But the beat is every bit as easy to follow.  And the sounds, the SOUNDS!  Listen to the previews and you'll be hooked. <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|I tend to hate anything that EVERYONE else just LOVES.  Just 'cause.  But when it comes to Coldplay, I can't help myself. Great collection from a solid band that has a bright future. As a musician, this album is delicious on so many levels.  I don't understand the jabs as the production feel of the disc...when you hear these guys live, it's still clean, well executed music with lots of heart and passion.  Just like the album.  The lyrics are not trite or sappy, but openly introspective and visceral.  Sometimes naked honesty makes people nerveous.     It really does feel like \\"Rush of Blood\\" Pt II.  The growth from the band is not phenominal, but there is some progression. Previous album have always had tracks that were airy and almost formless.  The boys are making songs that are more solid, and have presence both as songs and as statements.  The themes in this album are easier to find and relate to.  It is a little more mainstream friendly, but I don't see any sign of sellout here.  It's still the same Coldplay, only better, cleaner, and a little louder.    I'm finding that reviews from this album are drawing a lot of short-sighted dissenstion.  No album by any band will please everyone on earth.  Music is VERY subjective.  That's why there are SO many different kinds.  Alot of people who gravitate to harder styles of rock aren't going to find introspective, creatively poignant lyrics and gracefully blended melodies and clean, simple guitar attractive. And that's Coldplay's stock in trade. That doesn't make it bad that some folks don't like it.  It just means you don't like it, and that's fine.  I'm not going to sites for bands I know I don't like and trashing their music or fans.  Music is a wonderful thing, full of diversity and beauty.  I wish small-minded people would stop muddying the water with silly diatribes about why people suck.  Go listen to something you like and leave we saps be, 'kay?
B00005QAPH|5.0|In this, the directors most personal work,  Fellini ventures further from traditional narrative, with fascinating results. It's his first foray into the blurring of reality and illusion, wakefulness and dreams, that would increasingly characterize his later films. The technique would never work so seamlessly as in this exploration of the filmmakers unruly, often unreal creative process.
014118213X|4.0|Although I had a rough and slow go for the first 10 pages or so, I gained interest once I could understand who was who among the characters speaking and being mentioned. The further I read the more I enjoyed this book that opened a window onto the unnerving and harsh social protocol and class-conflict prevalent in Edwardian England. Brace yourself; the end delivers a powerful wallop.  <br /> <br />Readers relate to this story in different ways. To me, \\"connect\\" was the essence of Forester's message. When I got to the end I realized the profound significance of two words spoken by Margaret Schlegel: \\"only connect\\". People need to take a good look at themselves and account for their behavior. They need to grasp their surroundings and get a good grip on the world they live in. In other words they need to connect their lives with the realities of the world and with society at large. <br /> <br />The case in point is the Wilcox males. The father Henry and his son Charles live in a cloistered world full of nothing but old cronies like themselves who are each one wealthy, arrogant, ruthless, uncaring, and completely disconnected from the rest (the dregs) of society. Their world was limited to the confines of their own pampered surroundings. These men remained protected within an impregnable fortress built to uphold their lifestyle and prevent them from ever connecting with the greater of society. Snug and cozy, coddled in their fortresses, they are oblivious to the plight of others. They are aloof and convinced that their wealthy social status gives them a green light to do anything as they please, regardless of moral issues and negative consequences to others. As upper-class gentlemen with God-granted rights to abuse and bully anyone else lower than them, they considered their elevated social positions to be even above the reach of the law of the land.  <br /> <br />Opposite of the Wilcox's are the Schlegel sisters who are genuinely good-hearted and good-natured but alsorich and pampered, and thus disconnected with the rigors of the poor who are trying to eke out a living.  Although the sisters realize that they should do something to help the poor, they aren't exactly sure what to do and aren't fully aware of the strict protocol and taboos placed on both the rich and the poor in accomplishing their objective. The two sisters, social reformers ahead of their time, happen to make the acquaintance of a poor, lower-class young gentlemen name Leonard at a concert. While their intentions were good, they take it upon themselves to make Leonard their pet charity case. But in trying to help him advance, it never occurred to them that others, even those on the receiving end, aren't as open to or appreciative of their concerted efforts. The ensuing story is a classic example of the types of social conflicts existing in Edwardian England between the upper and lower classes in terms of not only their disdain toward each other but also their reactions to charitable efforts by social reformers such as Margaret and Helen Schlegel. <br /> <br />As enlightening as the story is in terms of British customs and social norms, the storyline frustrates you because of the activities, behavior and attitudes displayed by the super wealthy who are downright condescending to all persons and things \\"below\\" them. As readers, we are helpless to do anything to support those wronged by arrogant, aloof, and money-hungry aristocrats symbolized by the Henry Wilcox's of the world.  <br /> <br />Ahead of its time, this novel broaches several social issues, from women's rights, charity to the poor, to the ills of the wealthy. Finally, this book not only contains an enormous bite to chew and swallow in terms of the social conflicts it brings to the table but also it ends up tasting so good in its imaginative and flowing prose that I think you will like this book by E.

The problem of radical Islam is not just on buses in Jerusalem- it is Thai Buddhist monks who are beheaded because they stand in the way of a Muslim state in a traditionally Buddhist country, it is kidnapping in the Philippines, Asia's sole Catholic nation, it is nightclubs bombed in Bali, foreigners beheaded in \\"our friend\\" Saudi Arabia, teenagers sentenced to death in Nigeria for the crime of bearing a child out of wedlock, bloody riots over newspaper articles about Miss World, Christians thrown in jail and losing their shops and homes for insulting the prophet when they aver they do in fact believe Christianity to be true and Islam false. Where do these things come from?   Let the PC reviewers get in high dudgeon, but if you are looking for some actual information about Islamic terror, this book is the place to go.   The book does not - despite the reading comprehension troubles of the reviewers who pan it (or perhaps the fact that they generally have not read the book at all gets in the way)-, claim that radical Islam is the only \\"true\\" Islam.  It does show how radicals use Islam to draw recruits or financial support from the devout, and why the radicals are regarded as more \\"religious\\" than other Muslims.  You can hold tight  to your PC opinions despite the facts, or you can take a gamble and read some opposing views.   After reading some of the negative reviews which boil down to \\"How DARE he?\\" I think it is more important than ever to read this book. If in history you learned that Islam \\"spread\\" as opposed to \\"conquored\\", you need this book as a corrective.
B0009ML238|4.0|Yeah,they've already said that they sound like DT,like Symphony x,and even a little like Pagan's Mind,but they're still very good musicians,and songs like Sin,Why An I Here and Imperial Destruction show some unique style. Vocals are awesome!!<br /><br />Demo version of \\"Glory of The Empire\\" is better than the album version;at least that's what I think.People who have heard it should know what I'm talking about.Anyway,can't wait for their next album.
B0006U4UAU|4.0|...And If I did \\"Tribulations\\" found on this album would probably be on that compilation...  I have found that when a friend brings a CD to your house and forgets to bring it home you should always check it out - Its how I got into Joy Division and also how I found this album. It was a lucky day when I popped this one into my stereo for a listen.  Overall it's a really interesting set of tunes going from the indie sound to more electronic tracks that are well orchestrated making a sound that is edgy yet refined something like Fischerspooner meets conic youth - but maybe that's not exactly right either.  A track like \\"too much love\\" realy gets you into the groove after the wild, humorous and great \\"Daft Punk is playing at My House\\".  With live drums that sound like The Clash combined with \\"loungey\\" synth tracks and hand clap generators all wrapped up with cool subdued vocals you know you are in for a great listening experience with this album... and then there is a second album!   I like the first album better but the more the merrier.  The second album, which admittedly I have listened to less is a lot more focused on rhythm and les on well packaged songs that incorporate the entire band's abilities.  It's still very listenable. <br /> <br />This double album is good party music that's not too extreme for anyone's tastes... but its equally great music to listen to in the car at work or whatever.  Its not too silly and yet doesn't take itself seriously to the point of being artful pretentious garbage - its good stuff eventhough I have no idea what an \\"LCD Soundsystem\\" is (how can diodes systematically emitsound lol) . I would tell all fans of electroclash bands as well as fans of bands like Arcade Fire to go out and get this album it's a lot of fun and really is among the best new music. <br /> <br />Ted Murena <br />
0739302043|1.0|I suppose it's a tour de force in a way: a best-selling thriller in which 90% of the sentences have the verb \\"to be\\" as their main verb.  Was it that I was listening to it in the car rather than reading it?  Did its faults of style and diction stand out more to a listener?  (Examples: \\"prone\\" for \\"supine;\\"  \\"like\\" as an adverb; excessive use of superlatives as \\"the most amazing thing he had ever seen\\")  Colin Stinton, the reader, added to the sleaze by attempting a different accent for each character, some of whose names he couldn't pronounce.....  The thought that this book has remained on the best seller list for weeks appalls me.
0743201140|4.0|This book is proving to be a good tool, especially to managers who have recently changed organizations.  I'm using it to better understand and manage my staff...and my staff can better manage me!  It is a refreshing approach to look at strengths, when most of our training and reinforcement is to fix our weaknesses. <br /> <br />Unfortunately(?), several members of my staff are strong in \\"Consistency,\\" which is not described in the book.  If anyone reading this review has located an errata section (somewhere) that includes this text, 'would like to see it!
B00092ZL80|5.0|It's about time these 2 great bands played together! This concert is highly entertaining and has you dancing in your living room! I enjoyed each band by themselves, but when they're together, they're awesome!!! I'm so glad they taped this fantastic show. It's not to be missed!
0140187537|5.0|i had a modern american literature class this last semester and our prof gave us a choice of four steinbeck novels: grapes of wrath, east of eden, travels with charlie, and the winter of our discontent.  i chose 'the winter of our discontent' and i was so glad i did.  this is one of the finest examples of american literature i've ever read.<br /><br />the novel itself starts out a bit slowly and i was afraid i wouldn't enjoy the novel.  it's only in chapter four that steinbeck really hits his stride and shows why he's one of the crown jewels of american literature. i don't want to spoil it for anyone, but trust me, the prose is absolutely rapturous. i found myself constantly underlining sentences and paragraphs.  pound for pound, steinbeck rivals oscar wilde in clever witticisms and aphorisms.<br /><br />on the surface, yes, 'the winter of our discontent' is a novel about a middle-agend man coming to terms with the new american lifestyle and its accompanying materialism, but it's much more than that. it's a novel about family, love, morality, temptation, corruption, death and ultimately about life, and how our lives are infinitely connected, one to another. like most great literature, we're able to see ourselves in the book's characters.<br /><br />unfortunately we live in an era where 'hip' writers (like david eggers) receive undue attention. consequently, american literature seems to have taken a few steps backwards in quality. not too many of our modern day writers really know how to *write.* fortunately, we still have steinbeck to show us what's right about our literary past and show us what quality literature looks like--there's a reason the man won a nobel prize.
0805076476|5.0|OK. Wow. Strange. Really good. I just finished reading Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck also wrote that book, Haunted, with the story about Saint Gut-Free. When I found out Chuck was the one who wrote Fight Club, I decided I had to read it. And boy, was I right. Wow. Another amazing novel. It's told in the weirdest way ever, but in a good way. He really captures the essence of Tyler and his friend in a weird way, where even though \\"they\\" are the strangest of characters, you can somehow relate. The ending leaves a bit to be wanted, but I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. And even though it doesn't have suspense in the typical sense, you just really want to keep reading it. I really reccomend this book to anyone. I really love Chuck's books, and I had already started Survivor, also by him, before I started Fight Club, and it's good so far, too. It's told in a similar fashion as Fight Club. I really encourage you to read both.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I originally bought this on vinyl over 20 years ago when my drum teacher told me to learn \\"Contusion\\" and \\"Sir Duke.\\"  I have been missing listening to this treasure since getting rid of my turntable, so I was thrilled to finally get it on CD! Only now have I started getting into some of the lesser-known cuts and I love every single one. <br /> <br />Some of my favorites: <br /> <br />\\"Love's in Need of Love Today\\"--thematically sets the tone for the rest of the album.   <br /> <br />\\"Village Ghetto Land\\"--between the synth orchestration and the stark lyrics, it really grabs you. <br /> <br />\\"Contusion\\"--instrumental--the musicians on this cut are outstanding. <br /> <br />\\"Sir Duke\\"--one of the most sparkling songs on the album! <br /> <br />\\"I Wish\\"--I love the reminiscent lyrics--this song just rocks. <br /> <br />\\"As\\"--One of the smoother cuts--you'll find yourself singing along with this song all the way through! <br /> <br />\\"Saturn\\"--A beautifully written song. <br /> <br />\\"Ebony Eyes\\"--Yet another song I just can't help singing along with. <br /> <br />For the first few years I had this album, I only listened to my favorites, and I missed out on a lot.  As some others have said, you will get the full benefit of Stevie Wonder's masterpiece if you listen to the album in its entirety.
068987474X|4.0|Needless to say, initially I was not impressed with this book although I was dying to read it.  I was a little biased when it came to reading the numerous letters that Women sent to Greg about wondering if the person they were with were REALLY into them.  I could not believe the types of scenarios these Women provided in trying to rationalize their situation and they were still clueless to the fact that the person they were dating IS NOT IN TO THEM.  It was ridiculous!!  As I continued to read on, the book became more revealing to me as a mode of self-help not only for the many Women out there but for me also.  The main issue that I believe we make as Women when it concerns someone that we are interested in or love is that WE MAKE EXCUSES for all the wrong reasons why we should stay.  There were a few chapters that were very enlightening to my being as a Woman and it helped me to understand my past and present issues that I myself hid.  The book is a motivator to those who are looking for answers to their excuses from a Male point of view.  I eventually grew very appreciative of the book and I'm glad that I read it.

B00011F5DK|5.0|Our family loves this game.  I can't believe it can only be bought on the internet.  I had thought about buying it as a family gift for Christmas for some of our friends.  It is easy to learn how to play.  It makes everyone think and calculate there next move.  It is also a fast game so you do not have to plan a long evening to play.  We love it.
B000002JEV|5.0|Of all the recent Zeppelin (re)releases this is, in my opinion, the one to get. It is packed with amazing performances by the whole band and, in my opinion, it is more consistent, accessible and interesting as a whole than \\"How The West Was Won\\" (Plante is particularly at his best for these performances).<br /><br />In two CDs (the first recorded in 1969, the second in 1971), you get a ton of classic songs (mostly drawn from Zeppelin's \\"prime\\" era between I and III). Some reviewers have mentioned that Zeppelin IV classics such as \\"Rock and Roll\\" and \\"Evermore\\" are missing. While true, this is explained by the 1971, pre-IV recording date and is compensated for by extremely early versions of \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Stairway\\" and \\"Going To California\\".<br /><br />You also get the opportunity to compare live versions of:<br /><br />Communication Breakdown (which appears three times)<br /><br />I Cant Quit You Baby (which appears twice)<br /><br />Dazed And Confused (twice, as well)<br /><br />and Whole Lotta Love (which appears once within a classic Zeppelin medley towards the end of Disc 2)<br /><br />Finally, this also contains an astounding version of \\"Thank You\\" (the album closer) which greatly surpasses the studio version.<br /><br />All told, this album is a must have for any Zeppelin fan (big or small) which traces the changes and development of Led Zeppelin's live style during their first crucial years. ESSENTIAL.
B00005U122|5.0|I THOUGHT THAT THE CONCERT PUT ON BY ROGER WATERS AND HIS CREW WAS VERY EXCITING AND THE PRODUCTION WAS GREAT, I'M AN OLD PINK FLOYD FAN FROM MANY YEARS AGO, REMEMBER SEEING ROGER WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER WITH PINK FLOYD IN BALTIMORE'S LYRIC THEATER IN 1971, (I STILL HAVE THE TICKET STUB). SO ANY TIME I CAN SEE ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND EITHER LIVE, OR ON VHS, OR DVD, IT IS ALWAYS A THRILL FOR ME, I THINK ANY FAN WOULD THOROUGHLY ENJOY \\"IN THE FLESH\\".
0385512058|4.0|This book is a real inspiration. For somebody that is not a natural \\"networker\\" it has brought this subject down to earth with practical and pragmatic suggestions and action plans, bringing this topic into a realm where it can be applied in day-to-day situations. <br />The book is an essential read for all business people, and in fact everyone that wants to be successful in today's interconnected world. <br />The book destroys the myth of the \\"self-made-man\\", and re-enforces the key role of relationships throughout. It is written in an easy style that does not take long to absorb. However, the lessons' impact, if taken to heart, will be lifelong!

158799190X|1.0|I can only guess that because Mr. Taleb has written a book specifically targeted to the media's tastes (without any troublesome math or any numbers at all) he has attained a protected status that puts him outside the realm of mortals subject to criticism. His success reminds me of the Midwestern sage whose non-dividend-paying stock is at around the same price it was in March 1998 and yet who remains the \\"world's most successful investor\\" on countless magazine covers, TV programs and newspaper copy.  <br /> <br />That a piece of empty intellectual snobbery like \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" should be hailed far and wide is unfathomable except in a world bent on shallowness. If anyone who read Fooled by Randomness at its publication can summarize its conclusions with a straight face today, I would like to hear from him.  <br />

B0007TKNIS|3.0|If you saw this show on Broadway, you'll probably be disappointed.  But, if not, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  The songs are wonderful, the female star has a melodic voice, and the two male leads are very good.  The story is a bit far-fetched, but still worthwhile.  The costuming is terrific.
B00028HBKC|5.0|I think people are just shock to see somebody playing Jesus Christ in a R rated movie that's why all the controversy cause theirs lots of other different videos out their having Jesus in it this one is just the first to be rated R. The reason for that is it has to be more realistic thats the whole point of doing a great movie and besides all of this realy happen to him years ago. What was a disapointment, Mel Gibson didn't even get nominated for an Oscar for best director let alone win one that is a big disgrace, well who needs a stinking Oscar at least he won a \\"People's Choice Award\\" cause it all about what people want.
B00003CX97|5.0|I can't name my favourite book - there are too many.  But my favourite film has to be this.  Principally I am attached to its depiction of Sri Lanka including waterfalls, rivers and a sense of jungle even if some of the film was filmed in pretend jungle in botanic gardens.  I think this film is so incredibly well packaged and the script is so good and the visuals are stunning - that I can return to it again and again.    The criticism is that this film does not relate any reality.  Those who want to know about the real Bridge can go to Thailand and do their own research.    This is principally an entertaining \\"war\\" film all about face, principles, the British Empire, life in the army with a not unsympathetic portrayal of the Japanese general who in reality would have represented a more brutal oppressor.    Everything about this film resonates with something you can connect with in daily life:    \\"Without rules commander there would be no civilisation\\"    \\"We're under the heel of a man who'll stop at nothing to get his way\\"    \\"As for me, I'm just a slave, a living slave\\"    \\"someone deserves a medal sir!\\"    Some excellent speeches and a panoramic look at Life and Sri Lanka, captured at a time a little more pristine than at present.  Extrodinary climax at end with tremendous camera shots for a 50s film.  Brilliant!

6305252521|5.0|Literally it was ahead of common place \\"reality TV shows\\" that pathetically envelopes our television today.  The concept at the time was original with a sensational sense of theatre. <br /> <br />When I first saw this film on a trip to LA I had an inkling of what genius lurks in Hollywood.  This film combines major issues like relationships, romance, scripts, big brother and \\"Middle America\\" at its proverbial finest. <br /> <br />Perhaps this is Carey's best film and he plays a sincere guy getting clued up to his true situation when he meets the love of his life, played I understand by an English actress.  She was gorgeous. <br /> <br />From then, it's about finding her and escape. <br /> <br />The humour and lines are so unforgettable.  Truman's wife advertising Mococo coffee beans from the mountains of Nicaragua.  Shows you what suckers we viewers can be ... <br /> <br />Sensational - especially for incurable romantics and those who seek the meaning of life.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is absolutely MIND-BLOWING!!! It's absolutely one of the best films ever made. The direction, the writing, the acting... everything is brilliant! And Kate Winslet continues on amazing me with every performance. Charlie Kaufman is certainly a GENIUS, he first wowed me with Adaptation and now he gives me this, which is again MIND-BLOWING!! A MUST SEE!!!  <br /> <br />
0790733226|5.0|I read the book but the film did not dissappoint.  Of course as a film it is designed to appeal to Americans - frankly the film was more entertaining than the book which included about five people visiting the alien world - more scientifically credible by all means. <br /> <br />This film is a tremendous breakthrough in CG animation and the use of realistic news casts and video inserts to convey a sense that it really happened.  If it did happen, how would it unravel and the book is a masterly portrayal of how things could change.  The script also analyses the scientific method, Occam's Razor and the problems with truth and the bugbear of science and relgion - veering rightly in my view towards science against the dogmatic aspect of religion. <br /> <br />How accurately the film foretold the tragedies of suicide bombers.  How lovingly it showed the whole of a dessert community madly celebrate the message from outer space, in so diverse a fashion and hyperbole as only Americans could. <br /> <br />The best bits were views of our solar system and such extraordinary footage of young Ellie - rushing down a corridoor to open the medicine chest. <br /> <br />The best film of 1997 and perhaps the 90s sadly underated and comparable to other Zemeckis treats like Forest Gump. <br /> <br />Entertaining, educational and the depiction of a golden age for the US and Americans, the best in its civilisation which was set to change in the Post Clinton era.  Thank you!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove at first seems rather slow moving. This is because it is about characters more than it is about events. First rate actors such as Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones perform at their very best! This story is not just about the old west. It has a great deal to say about life! It is a first-rate miniseries that transends the Western genre.
B00003W8NM|5.0|\\"Fight Club\\" has many naysayers.  They call it plotless, they call it pointless, some even call it fascist.  They complain about the amazing amount of graphic violence, the plot's twists, and the film's lack of intelligence.    These people need to take a deep breath, count to three, and watch the movie over again.  If they still can find nothing to like, they need to have their head checked.    \\"Fight Club\\" is one of the best films I've ever seen.  Beyond it being one of the finest novel-to-screen adaptations ever, it is simply an astounding film.  Everything about it is designed to shock the viewer out of complacency: the subliminals, the fantasy cutaways, even the brutal violence are really just punctuation marks, underscoring the movie's actual statements.  Beneath the action movie facade, \\"Fight Club\\" is really an intellectual film.    \\"Fight Club\\" is about the modern American male, and the state of permanent angst and adolescence they've been forced into by a society which raises them without fathers, force-feeding them dead-end jobs, consumerist garbage and idiotic \\"everyone-is-special-in-their-own-way\\" psychology.  What's interesting is that the film not only provides a counter-argument, but an argument against its own argument.  It suggests a parallel extreme, wherein we would be forced back into another Dark Age, would be wrong as well.    The narrator in \\"Fight Club\\", who is nameless throughout the film, seeks to escape from the urban nightmare his life has become, as it causes him terrible insomnia.  First, he tries attending support groups for people with lethal illnesses, despite his lack of any.  This helps him to confront death and despair in a tangible way, and appreciate the fact that he's alive, curing his insomnia.  That is, until he meets Marla Singer, a fellow faker who makes him unable to find the release he so desperately needs.  Marla and the Narrator manage to come to an agreement about who can attend which group, but the damage has been done.    A little later, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a man who is the polar opposite of him.  Tyler lives on the edge, making soap, being a waiter at fancy buffets (where he does various obscene things to the food), and changing reels at the movie theater (where he splices frames of dirty movies into kiddie pics).  Something about Tyler is magnetic to the Narrator, and through a series of events the two come to live together, and create the eponymous Fight Clubs.    To tell anymore would spoil the movie's many delights; it's subversive, funny, thought-provoking, thrilling and consistantly entertaining.  Fincher's direction takes major risks and constantly manages to succeed, and the thought that's been put into every frame is evident.  The cinematography is excellent, the Dust Brothers music hip and appropriate, the writing stylized and snappy, capturing the novel's tone without being overly derivative.  \\"Fight Club\\" is a masterpiece, the best Hollywood film in a very long time.  Enter with an open mind, and you'll come out singing its praises.
B00005JNJT|5.0|This is undoutably the best Batman movie to date...and yes, i also mean better that Burtons! <br /> <br />This is the Batman from the comics, the way Bob Kane intended him to be. The cast is spectacular. The tone of the movie is spot on and realistically based in the modern day world. Not only is Batman Begins a 'great comic book movie'...it's a 'great movie'-period! I foresee oscar paying this picture a couple of nods come academy award time next year...Yes... it's just that good! Let's hope the sequel keeps the bar raised just as high or higher than director Chris Nolan has pushed it!
0393317552|5.0|This review was written by cm stahl (...)     Jared Diamond starts this book by asking a simple question. That is: Why are people of European descent so much more successful than the rest of the world? His answers to that are extremely well articulated but yet they are not particularly complex. They gainsay the obvious answer that may have (and often does) have racial overtones. Briefly the answer has nothing to do with genetics.    Diamond goes to wonderful detail to describe how natives of Africa, New Guinea or South America have to live their lives in desperate conditions and the ingenuity that is required to survive. To boil a lengthy thesis into a few words he would say that the environmental conditions for different peoples spelled their destiny. \\"History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among people's environments, not because of biological differences among people themselves\\"    The book outlines a very basic point that prevails throughout history and that is they who control information technology rule the world. I have firmly believed this for many years and reading Diamond's book strengthened that thought.    In the earliest days that technology consisted of the tools to hunt which led to storing wild crops which led to agriculture which led to communities and writing and disease and war and more. The picture is not always pretty. It is real. Other ethno-biologists may disagree with his premise but they cannot deny that Diamond's thinking is very fruitful in understanding humanity and our history.    The cultivation of food led to great societies over the history of humans and that led to some of the most significant governments and therefore dominant armies and then of course, international domination. The reason some areas were able to tame wild plants into vegetables and animals into domestication are purely environmental according to Diamond. The environmental factors include the number of animals that could be domesticated either for food or work and the amount of wild harvest that could be used in agriculture.    These factors varied profoundly over the earth and were certainly affected by climactic conditions. Europe had the most favorable conditions for this and that led to the creation of communities and ultimately to dynasties and world domination. The United States was formed as a residue of that fact.    Despite the geo-economic factors that distinguish the \\"First World\\" from any others, there is no genetic factor that suggests that they are intellectually inferior. To some extent those of us from the \\"First World\\" have had our world handed to us on a platter and we may be less ingenuous than our \\"Third World\\" compatriots. This is a notion worth contemplating.
B00005JKBC|4.0|When this movie came out in November 2001, my big brothers took me to see a movie that had Robert Redford and Brad Pitt.  \\"Hmm,\\" I thought, \\"I'm not sure about this, but it's a free ticket, so what the hell?\\"  Believe me when I say that this movie is so much more complex, intense, and entertaining than it looks.  The trailer gives the totally wrong impression of what SPY GAME is about.  This is not --- I repeat 'NOT' --- an \\"action\\" movie.  Instead, SPY GAME takes a thinking-person's knack for clever storytelling, and juices it up with the flashy and quick style seen in many of today's movies.  Again, don't let the trailer allow you to judge this film.    Tony Scott's movies have always had that quick-cut, fast-paced, full-force style to them.  His brother Ridley Scott is a much better filmmaker; why is that?  Because Ridley (THELMA & LOUISE, BLACK HAWK DOWN, ALIEN) has better control of the action and knows when to tone things down.  In SPY GAME, Tony Scott finally finds his niche in great filmmaking, where style is complimented by good characters and a terrific story.    Nathan Muir (wonderfully played by Robert Redford)is a CIA operative, who on January 1991, is on his last day before retirement.  However, his protege Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt in one of his better roles) is captured in Su Chou Prison in China, while the U.S. and the Chinese are negotiating trade talks.    When Muir learns of Bishop's capture, he races against time to save him from execution.  Unfortunately, some CIA investiagtors and bureaucrats aren't as eager because of the aforementioned trade talks.  What's fascinating about this setup is that Muir is always one step ahead of the game than those who want to abandon the rogue agent.  Instead of this being the \\"Muir/CIA Showdown\\" (which we do get some clever exchanges), there is actually a character study underneath it all.  As Muir is surrounded in a conference surrounded by his adversaries, pretending to play ball with them, he gives them detailsabout Bishop's past, training, and work ethic.  The storytelling is slightly faulty, because there are a few moments where Muir seems to be talking to the audience instead of the characters.  But this is where Tony Scott's energy saves these awkward moments, because Scott knew this much dialogue needs good camerawork & actors to keep us interested.  Scott invested enough time in the characters as well as the audience's thirst for high-stakes thrills.    Robert Redford hasn't really changed his acting that much since BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, but that's because he's smart enough to know his limitations.  He isn't a chameleon who creates characters; Redford just uses his natural gifts to embody the role with his own mannerisms.    Brad Pitt also doesn't do anything groundbreaking, but is also in the right frame of mind that Redford is.  Pitt possesses the charm of a gifted agent but the brash ego of a rookie.  The supporting cast is also simply acting the way we expect reliable character actors to perform --- they don't try to steal the show and trust the filmmakers.  This approach allows Scott's filmmaking style to drive the thriller at its best pace.  Pitt and Redford have a chemistry that makes us believe that Muir actually takes pride in Bishop's skills, while needing to maintain discipline and control over his new job.  Pitt's counter-reactions to Muir's mind-games give both men a texture not often seen in espionage flicks.  SPY GAME involves the morality of the two men, rather than preach about more universal themes.    I hate flashback sequences, but these are impressive and never slow down; much credit belongs to Redford because his narrative voice keeps things going.  The present-time Muir/CIA games are very much like a poker game.  Without giving away too much, the tactics involve simple tools like pagers, ambiguous dialogue, and keen eyes.  There's no violence, or anything that forces us to suspend disbelief.  Some neat moments include Muir quickly glancing at key data, and somehow getting information with the vaguest of words.  Another is the CIA digging up his office, when Muir has no reasonable excuse for getting out of the interrogation.  This movie is never a bore, and is very exciting considering most of it centers around a conference room.    In addition to the strong acting & directing, one of my favorite aspects of this movie is Harry Gregson-Williams's music.  His score includes some cool beats during the spy montages, and some powerful chords during those dramatic moments of betrayal and reflection.  Of all of the music I've heard from him (he's most famous for Michael Bay pictures ARMAGEDDON and THE ROCK), I easily call this his best work.    I really dig this movie!  It's not perfect, and maybe it does borrow some aspects that other thrillers (and maybe Bruckheimer pictures) have done before.  But this is a top-notch film with a strong presentation that keeps it moving.  Because SPY GAME is energetic and focused at the same time, it's an exceptional film that warrants a purhcase!    FINAL NOTE - The DVD features are all good.  There are some behind-the-scenes features that are worth checking out, and the Deleted Scenes (w/ or w/out Commentary) are actually good.  I usually don't like Deleted Scenes, because it's obvious why they shouldn't be there.  But these actually quite good, and would've added another layer that would've enhanced the story.  An excellent movie got a grade-A DVD treatment!
B00097DX3U|3.0|Too many times, a band will release a dynamite first album, only to follow it up with a poor showing on their second album. This is the case with Audioslave. I loved their first album, but was left cold by the second. There are certainly a couple of tunes on this CD that are great, but the overall experience leaves something to be desired.
B00005RHGK|5.0|The movie Jeepers Creepers is a slick and scary horror movie. From the duel inspired begining to it's horrifing end, this movie delivers. The thing most people might not now is that the director was convicted of child rape. That does not stop this film from being great. Good performences and great use of music makes this a bonna fide good time!
630463949X|5.0|If you enjoy the music of Fleetwood Mac but are not into building a library of their music, \\"The Dance\\" would be an excellent DVD to purchase. The disc contains 22 songs: mostly popular hits by Stevie Nicks, Lindsay Buckingham and Christine McVie, that will probably get you singing along. Recorded before a live audience at Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, the set is an interesting, constantly-changing, light show. The program builds to an energetic conclusion featuring two numbers with the USC Trojan Marching Band. The Trojans bring the audience to their feet cheering for their performances of \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Don't Stop.\\" Even Fleetwood Mac gained some extra energy from the college performers. \\"The Dance\\" is a DVD that you will enjoy many times, even if you are just a casual Fleetwood Mac fan.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Although many critics and die hard SW fan complained about the first episode, I enjoyed it a lot.  The pod-racer scene is one of my all-time favourites and obviously the special effects are brilliant!  Yes, Jar-Jar is an annoying ass,but the movie is very enjoyable.

I HAD NEVER HEARD OF GIA CARANGI BEFORE SEEING THIS MOVIE, HAVING FOUND OUT ALOT MORE ABOUT THE REAL GIA, ANGELINA'S PERFORMANCE WAS FANTASTIC AND SO REAL.

6305291446|4.0|I can't believe the series is still going.usually after a while horror series usually turn into comedy.The cast gets younger and younger.The directors get more amateur.And the audience becomes emotionally attached with the killer.But Halloween H2o was actually good.Thanks to John Carpentars music.And Michael hasn't changed a bit since the originals -forget part three it doesnt exist-Jaime Lee steals the show away,but she doesn't do it until the end.This movie is good-unlike part three which doesn't exist.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Somehow I had never seen this film, and I didn't even know that there was any decent concert footage of The Who in existence. (I was very disappointed in the Isle of Wight DVD.) This came in the mail yesterday, and I foolishly thought I would watch just a few minutes before going to bed. Needless to say, I got to bed very late. Words escape me.... wall-to-wall, fantastic Who performances. This is a required purchase for anyone who appreciates the Who, or who wants a thundering lesson on why they matter. Buy it now.
0767805712|5.0|Throw out the idea that this is science fiction. While there are futuristic elements in Gattaca, it is first, (and strongly) foremost a story about people.

Ethan Hawke is brilliant as Vincent Anton, a genetic inferior with a dream of going into space.<br /><br />Gattaca is part murder mystery, part love story, but 100% brilliant film-making.

B00028HBKM|4.0|I have been scanning the reviews and I think that most of the reviewers can be pretty easily segregated into two extreme stereotypes: the Christians who naively think that watching this movie will transform the worldview of every viewer into an instant convert--which as a fellow Christian I find to be rather insulting of common sense--and the other extreme of non-Christians who had no idea what to expect from this movie other than what they should never have expected in the first place: an entertaining Hollywood flick.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, the love of Christ is a love that disturbs. This is a very distrubing, non-entertaining movie, which is exactly what it was supposed to be.<br /><br />I give the film four stars instead of five for two reasons.<br /><br />1) It was marketed to Christians (good) but it was marketed as a mainstream theater flick (bad) in hopes that the casual observers would convert. I do not blame Mel for this directly, nor the filmmaking company. This was the fault of naive churches that embarrassed themselves by buying out theaters and harrassed strangers at the theater entrances. Mel did market to these churches directly, so there is some indirect responsibility there. This point is minor compared to #2, ...<br /><br />2) The film itself is unfairly incomplete. Mel had every intent all along to ONLY show Jesus' crucifixion, and, generally speaking, it was fairly true to scripture, if artistically exaggerated at times. However, while any section of the Bible put to film very well would earn five stars, this is nonetheless a movie, one that deserves critical evaluation from a movie perspective. It was a movie direction decision--not a Bible-documented reality, but a DECISION by Mel Gibson--to refuse to portray some of the pre-crucifixion ministry of Jesus. Granted, there are a few flashbacks during this film that portray the character of Jesus in various key points of his ministry, but these flashbacks are few and far between, buried in an agonizing mush of blood-splattering gore. From a movie critic perspective, despite my love for Jesus, and despite my tearful, full appreciation for what He did for me, nonetheless I would demand that my Jesus be portrayed as more than just some guy who was killed \\"like a rose trampled on the ground\\". That is so important, yes, but a film about by saviour is incomplete without being a film that is also about my lord and my teacher.<br /><br />Most importantly, I would want a film about the passion of the Word who became flesh to absolutely include profound instances of Him declaring that he is I Am.<br /><br />I do think that the film was well-made for what it attempted to be--a very artistic painting from the mind of one artist that may or may not be fully appreciable by all Christians.<br /><br />Most certainly, this film should NOT be watched by anyone who has not been educated about who this man is or that he claimed to be God the Son who was dying for our sins, and why he was necessary, etc. Most uneducated non-Christians have proven themselves unable to bear watching this gore with enough curiosity to dig deeper and find out what it was all about. All they will see is a terrible murder.<br /><br />And I think it is a terrible act of naivety on the part of my brethren to have expected otherwise.<br /><br />On the other hand, this film certainly does make it easy to identify sheep from goats. Those who hate this film either don't know the background of Jesus or have no love for Him in their hearts.een, buried in an agonizing mush of blood-splattering gore.

B0002234LS|5.0|The director/writer behind this film was also responsible for STIR OF ECHOES, another underrated film. I think I would like to see more of his work. This film has rewatch value--worth buying. There are films with no rewatch value: may or may not be fun the first time one sees it, but the second or third time, it is terrible or at least humdrum. On the other hand, there are quality movies that can be watched multiple times and occasion increased enjoyment. SECRET WINDOW is one of those movies. I enjoyed this the first time, although I never thought that I wanted to own the DVD. However, I noticed a $10 price tag; upon watching again, I realized its worth. Those behind this film obviously put something into this, more than the desire to make money. We always know neither Johny Depp nor John Turturo will disappoint, but the story, dialogue, pacing, scoring and directing captivate and disturb. People who liked STIR OF ECHOES, THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, TWELVE MONKEYS, MINORITY REPORT, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, THE SHINING or the like will like this film. Others, probably not so much. I HIGHLY recommend it.    <br />

068987474X|5.0|I was watching that fateful episode of \\"Sex and the City\\" where Burger dropped the bomb on the girls...not so much on  Miranda...because she was open to hearing the truth. <br />My first reaction was to laugh at how cruel he was being by saying \\"he's just not that into you.\\"  And then I thought about it.  It made perfect sense.   <br /> <br />This book is such a revelation because it's message is SO SIMPLE.  I love that Liz also gives the women's perspective.  As women of the 21st century, our views can easily be argued but the point is this...even if we have a convincing arguement, men will continue to BE and FEEL and REACT the same way.  We can't get caught up in trying to fix them, or continue to make excuses for them until they \\"come around.\\"   <br />It's a tough pill to swallow at first but, by the end of the book, and by reading some of the letters written to Greg, you'll be convinced...  Let's all say it together...\\"He's just not that into you!\\"  <br />But the good news is...when you find someone who IS into you, you'll definately know it.  Great book! <br /> <br />Fran from Jersey

6304696515|5.0|The two movies, `Dangerous Liaisons' directed by Stephen Frears and `Valmont', directed by Milos Forman are a real anomoly in that they were released at almost exactly the same time and tell almost exactly the same story, based on an old novel, `Les Liaisons Dangeruese' by Choderlos de Laclos. It is a minor tragedy that `Valmont' received so much less attention and promotion than `Dangerous Laisons'. I suspect that had a lot to do with the fact that `Valmont' was released by the company Orion which may have been in its last throes of survival and simply did not have the means to promote the film.<br /><br />The only bright side of this situation is that the `Dangerous Liaisons' implementation of this story is much better. It is a sign of the value of `...Liaisons' that it is much better than a really worthy movie.<br /><br />I believe the difference in the quality of the two movies lies directly on the aptness of the casting and the quality of the acting. On all the lesser qualities which go into making a movie such as set decoration, cinematography, editing, music and the like, the two films are easily on equal terms.<br /><br />The heart of the matter is in the comparison of `...Liaisons' casting of Glenn Close and John Malkovich in the principle roles versus `Valmont's casting Colin Firth and Annette Bening. While Firth is physically much more believable as a Casanova type, Close and Malkovich are far superior than Bening and Firth at playing world class scoundrels. At the secondary level, `...Liaisons' casting of Uma Thurmen and Keanu Reeves as the two young innocent lovers is immensely more satisfying than the `Valmont casting of unknowns Fairuza Balk and Henry Jones. My memory of their relative careers is a bit dim, but this movie is ample evidence of why Uma and Keanu are big stars today and Fairuza and Henry are footnotes to cinema history.<br /><br />Of the fifth major role, we have `...Liaisons' casting Michelle Pfeiffer versus `Valmont's casting Meg Tilly. This may be the only role where the two movies are close. Tilly gives a great performance as a naïve young wife who ultimately gives into Valmont's seductions, but I think Pfeiffer is even better. Here, the difference may have been in the writing, as I suspect Pfeiffer's role is just a bit more strongly written, so Michele had more to work with.<br /><br />If nothing else convinces you, compare the seduction scenes between Malkovich and Thurmen versus Firth and Balk and the mix of sweetness with darkness in the former versus the pure soft core porn of the latter will carry the day.eg Tilly.

B000001ELD|4.0|GENE SIMMONS(1978). Gene Simmons' first solo album.    By the time it was 1978,Gene Simmons had already become one of the most famous men in America. Simmons,along with his fellow bandmates Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,or Peter Criss had all made KISS the #1 most popular band in America(according to what several Gallup Polls said)--the only problem was that Ace Frehley and Peter Criss had started befriending drugs and alcohol,and after several problems in the band,on September 18,1978,Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,and Peter Criss all released their self-titled solo records,which they had released to take some time off from each other to do their own material. How did The Demon's solo record turn out? Read on for my review of this:    This album,while it wasn't anywhere close to being Paul Stanley's solo album or Ace Frehley's solo album,was still really good. Gene Simmons had certainly developed an ego around the time when he had began writing material for this record and when he had started recording it,and it does kind of show here...but in this instance,that is a good thing. When Gene Simmons was recording this album,he brought in several people like Cher(his girlfriend at the time),Joe Perry,Donna Summer,etc. to help him out with this album,and all of the people who worked on this album with Gene all did a great job at helping make this a good record--they gave more substance to it. The opening track here is RADIOACTIVE,which is a really strong,catchy,and impressive way to open an album--Gene's vocals on this track and Joe Perry's guitar work here both sound really good,and the song,which is about a girl who is maybe a little bit crazy,is just hillarious,fun,and funny from top to bottom--it's a shame that this song was never a hit. Here we also have SEE YOU TONIGHT,a ballad that is very reminiscient of the 1960's(and as mentioned above,this does sound like it was influenced by both The Beatles and the songwriting collaboration between John Lennon and Paul McCartney)and is really pretty--I'd have to rank this song as the best ballad that Gene Simmons did solo),TUNNEL OF LOVE is very psycho and egotistical--but it is still funny and still very good). And among other tracks on this record,the other two best songs on here(right after RADIOACTIVE)are LIVING IN SIN(this track is totally hillarious--the lyrics and the dialogue on this song are both crazy but still really good)and MAN OF 1000 FACES,which Simmons wrote as a tribute to his favorite actor,the late silent horror actor Lon Chaney(RIP). I myself am a Chaney fan,and anyone with a passing knowledge of Lon Chaney knows that this song does a great job about singing the life of Chaney and the reputation(onstage,not offstage)Chaney gained when he was famous(Lon Chaney was one of the biggest film stars of the 1910's,1920's,and 1930(which was the year he died)but while he still gets a lot of respect and recognition in Hollywood today,most people don't have a clue who he is these days). This album closes with Gene Simmons re-recording the classic song WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR,one of the songs that inspired him when he was a little boy to be famous--it's not a great cover version of that great song,but it's still not bad--you may roll your eyes a little bit while listening to it,and it sort of drops and drags at times,but definitely give it a chance. The rest of the album,while it is not a work of art,is still really good--with this CD, you can kind of tell that Gene Simmons kind of took his ego and his childhood influences,wrote songs off of them,and then put them both together for his solo album--and in this instance,that is a good thing.    Overall,a good solo record. Some people have bashed this album before--but really,this isn't a bad album. It shows the creative side of Gene Simmons,and we all know that a musician putting his creative side into his own album can be a good thing--this album is solid(if I could,I would give it 4.5 stars and,as a letter grade,I would give this album an A minus)and it is a must have for all KISS/Gene Simmons fans.    P.S. Check out my \\"So You'd Like To...take a walk in the mind of Gene Simmons\\" guide.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|When Fire-Fly was on FOX I recorded most of the episodes (which was hard to do given the erratic schedule).  When I watched this set, I enjoyed seeing the shows in order including the never aired episodes; seeing the shows in order allowed me to enjoy more of the arch that Whedon was building for the show's first season.   <br /> <br />The combination of western/futuristic scenery and clothing was new for me because it was done so blatantly, but it was a creative combination and fitting for a future where humanity is expanding similar to settlers in the old west.  What really drew me to this series was the depth that the characters displayed, especially the captain Malcolm Reynolds; in my opinion, the characters show much more depth than the ones on Buffy or Angel. <br />

Beyond amazing!
B00005JNTX|4.0|I'll be short and to the point. While I don't necessarily like intense violence, this film represents what I think is sorely lacking in many Hollywood films -- A Fresh Vision.<br /><br />So much of what we see is rehashed, refried, regurgitated stuff. It lacks real creativity, a real voice, something new. Not so with SIN CITY. Whatever your tastes are, if you appreciate film, you need to see this one.<br /><br />[...]
B000002GBJ|4.0|This album must be viewed in its context: It was created when few, if any, artists were versatile enough to take over all aspects of an album. Rick Wakeman was, and continues to be, an astounding keyboardist, and the sound he created more than 30 years ago with a wide variety of instruments (including a pipe organ!) can thrill even today. It is fun to see such creativity at work. The downside is that the compositions themselves have not all stood the test of time, although I would recommend \\"Anne Boleyn 'The Day Thou Gavest Lord Hath Ended'\\" to anyone, anywhere, at any time. If you are a fan of orchestral rock, as typified by Wakeman's involvement in Yes, I recommend this album as a worthy companion to any collection of that music.
B000002ADT|5.0|I have since bought other jazz cd's but this one is easily the greatest of all. It is in a class by itself. \\"Cannonball\\" and Coltrane are phenominal on this cd.  The whole cd burns from the very opening notes of So What until the last track Flamenco Sketches.  A must have for any jazz enthusiast or someone wanting to get into jazz and not sure where to start.
B0000024TT|5.0|Leonard Cohen's first album is a flawless debut, full of powerful and evocative imagery that is at once both poetic and prosaic (indicative of Cohen's talent as both a novelist and a poet). \\"Suzanne\\" is a perfect opener, with its haunting, repetitive melody built around the half step between the third and fourth on both the F and Bb chords and its surreal lyrics. \\"Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye\\" is another highlight of the album, a song about human frailty and accepting the inevitable. Cohen is famous for the way he combines the spirit and the flesh in the quest for redemption and he does this beautifully in songs such as \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" and \\"Teachers\\". Cohen's work is not background music. People might complain about Cohen's voice but I would rather listen to him sing than an opera singer anyday. His untrained, recognizable voice gives the music a more human quality, making it that much easier to relate to. Give this music your full attention and you will be well rewarded.
B00000J7SS|5.0|This was the very first jazz cd I ever bought/listened to and was absolutely blown away.  Having never listened to jazz before I didn't know what to expect, but was thourghly impressed.  My favorite tracks are Pharoah's Dance, Spanish Key and the track that had me hitting the repeat button Miles Runs The Voodoo Down. If electric jazz isn't your thing then but want to get into listening to Miles, go out and get Kind of Blue.
B000001E18|5.0|Even though the album Achtung Baby tried some new things, and took a step away from the usual U2 sound, Zooropa is REAL experimentation. Heavy on electronics and techno elements, Zooropa is a gigantic leap from whatever you would expect from the band, and it pays off, through some meaningful songs that truely delight the ears... that is, if you give it the chance.<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way first: I believe U2 are at their best when they are experimenting. They can produce some great rock songs, but really, U2 step into a new level of greatness when they try to convey their messages in other ways. Not all of their experiments work, but when they do, they work well. This is why I consider Zooropa, Pop and The Unforgettable Fire their best albums.<br /><br />The album begins with the soaring title track, giving you an idea of what you can expect. Bono's vocals are still the centrefold of their music, but his messages of how technology and it's effect on modern like are amongst whirling synthesizers and electronic sound effects, which truely captivate and entice listeners. You have to be open minded to understand it's excellence.<br /><br />After the outstanding opening track, we're treated with Babyface, which is a sexy, gorgeous song which I think is about falling in love with perhaps a celebrity you've seen on TV. Bono and the Edge work well in making teasing vocals, and it's got smooth, subtle backing instruments, ultimately delivering a warm, fuzzy song that is extremely underrated.<br /><br />Numb is next, with The Edge on lead vocals. He churns out line after line of ways you should live your life, until Larry and Bono kick in with falsetto backing vocals, creating one of the most unique songs the band has ever done. It's a difficult song, but a great one.<br /><br />Speaking of difficult songs... Lemon. Entirely sung in falsetto by Bono, with help from The Edge for the magnificant chorus', this song is truely delicious. Again, it lambasts technology and how it dominates the world today, describing how man wants to escape from what they have created, but never leaving. It is a magnificant track, and not only encourages much thought, but also gets you on your feet.<br /><br />Stay (Far Away, So Close!)... wow. This is a masterful little song, sung from the perspective of an angel desperate to help those who struggle through life. I am not familiar with the film this song was based on, but I was touched, regardless. Bono's vocals are just incredible, and this song is the perfect example.<br /><br />Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car is, perhaps, the most difficult song on the album. The meaning behind it is ambiguous; is it simply a song about a spoiled brat who crashed his car? Or is \\"Daddy\\" a much greater entity? This song is heavy on techno and synthesizers, drawing attention away from Bono's vocals. It's a very good song, but perhaps one of the weakest on this album.<br /><br />Some Days Are Better Than Others is the complete opposite of the above, offering us a happy, upbeat song that forces you to grin. Bono's lyrics are upbeat, and the bass really hold the bouncing drums and guitar together. It's a very good song, and it's probably its simplicity that stops it from being a masterpiece.<br /><br />The First Time is more than your standard ballad. It is, indeed, a love song, but also one that also has a relgious interpretation, as Bono suggests he's in no position to speak for God in every instance. There are many interpretations of this song, but evidently, it's a tragic little song, that is very moving.<br /><br />Dirty Day... the best song on the album. By a MILE. To me, it describes how difficult it is being religious these days, and that you have to accept things for what they are. Fantastic guitar and hissing synthesizers great a fabulous song, ending with a chilling climax. Just fabulous.<br /><br />Finally the album ends with The Wanderer. With powerful vocals from Johnny Cash, it's a songabout searching for meaning, and the desperate hope that meaning is searching for you. It is a creepy, haunting little song, and it ends the album extremely well.<br /><br />This is the longest review I have ever written, but really, I could talk about this album for hours. It's a masterpiece. Period. Don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Sure, it doesn't sound like U2, and the new style of music isn't exactly easy to get into from the start. But give it time, and go in there with an open mind. Trust me, you'll thank yourself for it.<br /><br />One of the best albums ever recorded.ohnny Cash, it's a song about searching for meaning, and the desperate hope that meaning is searching for you.

B000002UAU|5.0|I write only on behalf of those who wish to be known: <br />Listmania is a contentious prat and a prophet/philosophe wizard at and in both. Whereas opinion is question to greater truth, euphoria and orgastics symbolize true understanding; not in the latter,again, contentious sense.  <br />You Will Only understand this album after more than three listens, and best within the confines of life. Only then will you synch with this perfect opus. <br />A quandry most commonly associated with Sgt. Pepper, is whether it's the greatest album ever made. It is. That is Fact. And You Do Not Matter until you comprehend that. Why? <br />Well, to begin with, compare it to Beethoven's symphonies; all feelings of humanity, contextualized in synchronicity of various notes. Within the speaking language of music, Ludwig Van comtemporizes feelings of grandeur with, perhaps, the most perfect pages of music ever written. The object is to grant fear, malice, forethought-why, the very act of humanity-out of the listener. Not only negative feelings, though, but everything within the atmostphere of the body. When music can derive real feelings from you, you become interested and that is where the facit of opinion drops in casually; when it should have never been revelatory in the first place.  <br />The other side of this is thus: opinion is the search for better understanding. True. But what is most important to you, is you. Even the most benevolent hold hardcore contempt for those who doubt their greediest ideals. So you should be overjoyed that the beatles ever created this album, because it can appeal to anyone most easily. <br />Really, Sgt. Pepper was not only revolutionary sonically, but in practically every area possible. Cover, time, and themselves-wise, it certainly is the father of modern music and its every freedom. It evokes feelings of grandeur, sadness, and epochal wisdom with a mix of varied subtleties like timing and order. JUST when you become tired of being wrenched by theirutter beauty, they slow down into nice, soothing psychadelica. This is the roadmap for albums like Innervisions, OK Computer, and Sign O' The Times. <br />A great example of the Beatles excelling even the most archaic of song, is When I'm Sixty Four. Where McCartney swings easily throughout the simplistic song, boringly-it seems-until he hits that one high note that makes it seem like psychadelica-whose meaniing it was to be beyond all, and truly enlightening at once, like seeing the heavens. <br />And that is the other miracle of this miracle-so to speak-that is was borne of the sixties psychadelica, where all the failure and  wild eyed dreams conglomerated to create one huge dissapointment that has left us with more republicans than we can count-and succeeded better than any sane period of America could have hoped. They were the ire of the greatest, most preposterous dream within the sixties: that they could reach beyond the scope of normal life and transcend its difficulties for a better tomorrow; that they were all doing something. That is why this is the sole pride of the period when speaking of music.  <br />This LP deserves a seat at the table of greatness, shared by Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and the Beatles own comtemporaries and spawn-todays \\"Musicians\\".  <br />The great thud at the end of A Day In The Life is the the signifying mark, that the entire thing was a symphony, every space, note, and word, and they give it to the world forever. Then that psychedelica is tacked onto the end, to remind you to go back to your normal lives, and also to remind of the evironment from where the Beatles, as a group, were born. Completely Perfect, and yet faithfully grateful to human existence; the true deffinition and meaning of art.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|The Machinist was everything I expected it to be, a taut psychological thriller. Christian Bale is almost unrecognizable in the lead role of Trevor Reznik, a lonely machinist. Bale supposedly lost over 60 pounds for this role and believe me that's on the conservative side. The sheer horror of Bale's body alone is creepy enough to sustain the suspense in this movie. I have never seen an actor take his body to the absolute extreme like Bale does in this film. The story centers around Reznik's increasingly slippery grip on reality. Trevor Reznik has not slept for over a year and the effects on his physical and mental state are obvious. He can't eat and drinks only black coffee. Then, one day he accidently maim's a fellow worker and his tenuous grip on reality slides away. There are some nagging questions presented by director Brad Anderson throughout The Machinist. Why can't Trevor sleep? Who is leaving those notes on his refrigerator? Who is Ivan and why is he following Trevor? What is in Trevor's freezer? The Machinist creeps along at an almost glacial pace but it wraps up very neatly in the end. At it's core The Machinist comes down to the struggle for a man's soul. It will inevitably draw comparisons to David Fincher's Fight Club but without the social commentary. Bale's performace carries the film and will go down as one of the most haunting performances of the past decade. Highly Recommended to fans of the horror or suspense genres.
1400032717|5.0|... beginning with the chapter numbers, which go 2,3,5,7,11 and start you out with the way that the character thinks.  I know nothing about autism, but was captivated by this book's character and the way that he reacts to normal everyday occurrances.  Thoroughly enjoyable.
B00008DDRX|5.0|The ultimate race of the ultimate cars. Porsche vs. Ferrari at the most prestigious racing event; Le Mans. Real race footage combined with classic 70's style film making. If they tried to make this film today it wouldn't be as good with phony computer graphics. What you get here is real crashes and true racing, no cheesed out special effects. Mcqueen captures the essence of the International Auto Racer. Mcqueen was an excellent racer in real life who fancied Porshes. -Eduard Scott Bales <br />
0451191153|3.0|I read Atlas Shrugged and became fan of Ayn Rand and her principals. This book though in the same mould as Atlas Shrugged, still does not take it to that level. It starts well but then over the end slows down and just makes you skip pages. Especially when it reaches to the point when Howard becomes successful and joins Gail. Gails character becaomes a bit boring.
B0002V7OI8|4.0|The movie \\"Deep Impact\\" is about a how a giant comet is discovered heading towards Earth. The U.S. Government starts building a giant rocket that while destroy the comet, but the first time the astronauts in the rocket try knocking it off its path with \\"nukes,\\" they fail, and just blow it into two pieces. The first smaller piece hits earth and floods everything. I dont want to give away the ending, but i'll just say its sad. The best part of this movie was RON ELDARD.
B00004VVNB|5.0|Like it - or Hate - if you think about life today, this movie for its time - has it all. <br />Would love to see it re-hashed for todays movies - i reckon with the special effects available today - this movie would do things. <br /> <br />Glad i brought it for my collection
B0000026WD|5.0|I didn't think it got much better than \\"Thriller\\"....I was wrong.  \\"Dangerous\\" far exceeds Thriller in my book in terms of creativity and diversity in themes, etc. <br />Also a great cure-all for the \\"ear-buzzing\\" that comes occasionally to those of us with Multiple Sclerosis. <br /> <br />Put this CD in a great CD player...stick in the headphones...crank up the volume and MOVE YOUR BODY to the music!!! <br /> <br />It doesn't get any better than this!!! <br /> <br />
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|If you order this film I recommend the DVD version. Re-released by Disney, it contains followup commentary by the girl (now a woman) playing Dorothy. This is not a true followup to Wizard of Oz. But it continues the story in a different way. I had not realized there was a Return to Oz, made in 1985. Worth owning. Worth watching.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash's last album before his death is a masterpiece. Again working with Rick Rubin, American IV continues with great country versions of alt. rock songs plus some older songs. With guitar by Cash, The Heartbreakers' Mike Campbell, Red Hot Chili Pepper's John Frusciante and others, the music is great on this cd. Cash's voice sounds so mournful on this record. His version of Nine Inch Nails' Hurt makes it sound like a song he could have written himself. Also Fiona Apple, Don Henley, and Nick Cave do guest vocal work but none ever outshine Cash. Favorites include The Man Comes Around, Hurt, Give My Love To Rose, Bridge Over Troubled Water with Fiona Apple, I Hung My Head, Personal Jesus, Sam Hall, Desperado with Don Henley, I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry with Nick Cave, and Streets of Laredo. Cash was a legend and always will be. Highly Highly Recommended. R.I.P. Johnny Cash.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|THe special edition was well done and most enjoyable. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
B000002L68|5.0|The soundtrack to Purple Rain is one of those albums that defines a generation. This shows us that Prince could be a great storyteller and a great musician at the same time. The mixture of rock, R&B, and funk is brillantly used throughout. Favorites include Let's Go Crazy, Take Me With U, Darling Nikki, When Doves Cry, I Would Die 4 U, and the beautifully written Purple Rain. A classic album which anyone should own and listen to even if they don't like Prince. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|this concert offers the last live concert that the bee gees performed.  it is a great mix of their old songs and their renown saturday night fever/disco hits. there are sentimental moments that summarize the group's history.  unlike most other bands, this group only performed with its original members.  i highly recommend this.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The Clash's followup to their debut is a classic. This album has so many political messages it should be listen too. They have broaden their sound and this album has a mixture between punk rock and reggae which is used very brillantly throughout this album. Favorites include London Calling, Jimmy Jazz, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Lost in the Supermarket, Guns of Brixton, Death or Glory, Koka Kola, Four Horsemen, and the pop crossover hit Train in Vain. Highly Highly Recommended.
B000089RVX|4.0|Okay, I know I'm strange, but not only has this album been a favourite of mine for several years, but I found it great study music while I was in college.  I can still put it on and just listen for a couple hours while I read or work on a project, occasionally listening closely to some of the lyrics (as I am doing now).  In all this time the songs have grown familiar, but not old.  Rather they are like old friends that I frequently want to visit.<br /><br />I appreciate that nearly every word on the CD is understandable.  I like this genre of music, but dislike those artists that feel the need to unintelligibly scream nearly every word.  Sure there were a couple places I wasn't sure until I looked up lyrics on-line--but that would be true with almost anything.<br /><br />Really it is hard to describe the tracks, except to say that they're different, but all good.  No Amy Lee's voice doesn't sound radically different in each track, but you can find something different about each, be it the message, the tone, or just the beat.  The collection works together to snythesize one coherent whole.  Yes, a bit dark, but more enjoyable than depressing.<br /><br />I never heard any of these songs overplayed on the radio, so any saturation is due to my own choice of playing the CD--and I've not reached that point yet.  If you haven't checked this group out then give them a chance, especially if you enjoy the samples Amazon provides to listen.
B000002LHX|5.0|Prince's soundtrack to Tim Burton's Batman is great. Though not as good as his other albums, the music is still brillant throughout. The lyrics describe the situations that happen in the movie, including the weird love triangle between Vicki Vale, Bruce Wayne/Batman, and the Joker. Favorites include The Future, Electric Chair, The Arms Of Orion ft. Sheena Easton, Partyman (this song has a great scene to it), Vicki Waiting, Trust (this song also has a great scene to it), Scandalous, and Batdance. Highly Recommended.
B0000WN0ZK|3.0|Blow Up has its strong points in that it's a fine representational time-capsule of London in the sixties.  Notable is how rapidly the culture was changing and how its attitudes still reverberate today.      Aesthetically, I find it interesting that many films of the sixties look cleaner and crisper than many from the seventies decade.. they even feel relatively more modern in comparison.  I don't think anyone has ever satisfactorily explained this phenomenon to me, other than something happened to film stocks in the 70s that didn't preserve well.    Blow Up is a hybrid art-meets-commercial endeavor.  But it cannot be both things at once and not do a bit to undermine itself.  Aesthetically, It is very well composed but I found its pacing and mannered acting very frustrating.  Characters move  as if in a slow-motion funk and then they randomly jerk about.  It's like they attended the school of Ritalin-method acting.  In one scene, David Hemming goes skipping up the path on the way to the park, clicking his heels together midflight --made me laugh and cringe!  Somthing not right with that boy.    Yes, evaluated in the context of its time, Blow Up does deserve meritorious honor among the canon of must-see movies in your Cinema 101 class.       Maybe I just gave myself away; that I'm not into the literati approach to this film --like I'm required to strain it through my teeth like a fine wine and evaluate its bouquet.  Let's just say I'd watch it over most contemporary films (especially anything with Tom Cruise)  but it didn't get me any more excited than a six'er of Papst.
B000005IU2|5.0|The Stooges' second album is a masterpiece though not as accessibe as their other ones. The music is brillant, Iggy Pop has never sounded this good. Favorites include Down on the Street (CLASSIC), Loose, T.V. Eye, Dirt (CLASSIC), 1970, and  L.A. Blues (Great Brutal Ending). A punk rock classic which should be on anyone's shelf. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00004SYZ8|5.0|I heard this CD playing a birthday party and just HAD to have IT!
B00024I2Z4|5.0|There is a strong message for us all when watching Mulan. The main character, Mulan, represents the cluminess in all of us. She tries very hard to please her parents but always seems to come up short from their expectations until the time is right. I know it was like that for me growing up and for alot of people i know. Having seen this many times and enjoy it more as time goes by...if i was on a stranded island and can only have 3 DVD movies with me, this would be one of them. Very good storyline and animation as Disney is knowned for, this is one of their best IMO.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended viewing for all ages!
0385338686|3.0|This book was very funny, though not as humorous as the \\"Shopaholic\\" series.  The main character Samantha though seems to be patterned after Beck from Shopaholic, smart and determined, but always ends up in a sticky situation.  The book was very funny, but I was kind of hoping for more at the end.  It was a very good summer read though!
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole Kings Tapestry CD is one of the greatest CDs' on the market today as it was in the early days of it's release. Every song is well written and performed.
B000002J6F|4.0|Whenever I listen to this album, I always start thinking of the great 1972 CSN album that could have resulted from Stills's creative energy and the better songs Crosby and Nash were writing at the time, and what all three of them could have accomplished by challenging each other in the studio. . . but I might as well imagine how the Who's 'Life House' would have turned out.  This is still a very good record.  It realizes everything Stephen Stills ever hoped to accomplish by blending folk and country with R&B, Latin, and blues.  The \\"Raven\\" tracks produce a virtual stew of influences in a straightforward rock context, with \\"Rock and Roll Crazies/Cuban Bluegrass\\" and \\"Anyway\\" stnading out weth their staedy, rock-solid tempos.  The \\"Wilderness\\" cuts are lovely country-rock songs, with cuts like \\"Colorado\\" celebrating the American West and \\"Fallen Eagles\\" a damnation of what's become of it.  \\"Johnny's Garden\\" is the most accomplished of the \\"Consider\\" numbers, and it immediatley transports me to a mythical estate garden in my imagination.  Stills and Chris Hillman also got incredible playing out of themselves and their band on \\"The Treasure (Take One)\\" in the \\"Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay\\" set.  As a record that gets to the heart of American pop forms and myths, this album is not a masterpeice in the pantheon of the Band's 'Music From Big Pink,' but it's close enough.  Hillman was certainly pleased with Stills's drive.  \\"He made me try harder,\\" Hillman said of Stills, \\"and I like that, I really like that.\\"
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Heavy metal is, without a doubt, the most constricting and conservative form of rock.  Bands have come and gone faster than some of their breakneck tempos.  Some tried to stretch the boundaries and found that metal fans do not like radical departures from their original sound.  Others were merely poseurs whose hearts were not in the music, ala a jillion hair bands from the mid-1980's.  Which brings us to Judas Priest.<br /><br />  One of the first bands to fly the metal flag high, Priest broke into the States gradually, and finally broke big with \\"British Steel\\", a fine slab of punishing riffs and Rob Halford's trademark soaring, growling, snarling and near-operatic vocals, often within the same verse!<br /><br />  When backed by the conjoined guitar twins K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, it was a combination that proved lethal, especially in the heyday of \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and the follow-up \\"Defenders Of The Faith\\".  A slip in the formula came afterwards, followed by a return to roots on the \\"Painkiller\\" album that featured Scott Travis on drums.  His double kick style propelled the band into overdrive only to see Halford quit shortly afterward.<br /><br />  After a couple of solo projects from Halford, including the great \\"Resurrection\\" CD, and Judas Priest's offerings with new vocalist Tim Owens, the first being \\"Jugulator\\", an uneven and poorly focused album, and the much better \\"Demolition\\", which did not do well, either, rumors began to circulate that Halford was coming back to his former band.<br /><br />  Halford did rejoin with his mates and the chemistry has brewed a successful potion again.  \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" is a metal masterpiece, rich in the Priest tradition, meaning thunderous riffs, Halford's great vocals (he is metal's best singer, no contest) and a production that pins you to the wall.<br /><br />  From the opener \\"Judas Is Rising\\" to the opus that closes the CD, \\"Loch Ness\\", we hear a band that despite middle age clearly loves their music and, most importantly, believes in it.  Wherein lies the secret to Judas Priest's longevity.  Like other classic hard rock and metal bands like AC/DC, Iron Maiden and Deep Purple, Priest knows its strengths and stays comfortably embedded in its twin assault guitars, defiance-laden vocals and musicianship that can only be achieved through many years of working together.<br /><br />  Even rock publications that normally treat metal with disdain are giving \\"Angel Of Retribution\\" good reviews.  It's damn hard to argue with perfection.y loves their music and, most importantly, believes in it.   Wherein lies the secret to Judas Priest's longevity.

0684859106|1.0|First, I would like to say I liked the recipes in the book.  However it truly is old-fashioned in the sense that pictures are missing.  While one does not need a picture of each item, a few would have been nice.  As an avid cook, I like to see what the finished product should look like.  I just feel that in this age of great cookbooks this one could have been so much better.  I was disappointed to say the least.
B000001FDI|4.0|Like many a \\"baby boomer\\" I too am still a fan of Cream, Blind Faith and other Nineteen Sixties \\"Classic\\" rock bands.  In addition to the rock music styles of the `60's and intervening years, I also love many of the current styles of Alternative and Metal.  Blind Faith was one of the excellent bands and albums to close out the decade.  The other reviewers here have done a great job of pointing out the main points about the Blind Faith album.  I agree with pretty much everything they say, but I would like to clear up a few slight errors, omissions, or misconceptions. <br /> <br />First, the original vinyl LP released in August 1969 came with either of two different covers in the USA.  ATCO SD 33-304A had the infamous \\"Nude Girl with Airplane\\" cover, and ATCO SD 33-304B had the \\"Band Picture\\" cover (Note:  Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker posing with the \\"incorrect\\" instruments.)  At the time I did not know I had purchased the \\"clean\\" version.  I did not even find out about the \\"naughty\\" jacket until I got curious about the \\"B\\" in the catalog number.  Later, for many years the \\"Nude Girl\\" cover seems to have became only common on import pressings of the album (different catalog numbers as well).  The retailers had indicated to Atlantic Records that they would not stock the album with the nude cover so a second cover was put out.  This situation is similar to the US vs foreign releases of the Jimi Hendrix Experience album \\"Electric Ladyland.\\" <br /> <br />Second, Rick Grech (Bass, Violin) had been a member of Family, Steve Winwood (Piano, Organ, Vocals) came from Traffic, and both Eric Clapton (Guitar) & Ginger Baker (Drums) were from Cream. <br /> <br />Third, In addition to the two basic versions of the Blind Faith (1990) Polydor 825 094 CD featured here on Amazon, I know of a third.  There is the standard six-track version on one CD that is exactly like the original LP.  I agree, if it were not for the oddball long Ginger Baker piece \\"Do What You Like,\\" the album evenon vinyl, let alone CD would have been an EP.  Then there is the 2CD \\"Deluxe Edition\\" (2001) Polydor 314 549 529-2 with 5 extra tracks on the first disk and four long Jams on the second disk, also available from Amazon.  This two disk CD set pretty much covers the recorded output of Blind Faith.  There is a (probable bootleg) 2 CD set of Blind Faith alternate takes called \\"Rehearsals,\\" but I do not have it or know the contents.  But I came across a third CD version of Blind Faith on RSO Records from West Germany.  This import version of Blind Faith (1986) RSO (W. Germany) 825 094-2 includes two extra tracks not found on the 2 CD Polydor set.  It has songs called \\"Exchange and Mart\\" and \\"Spending All My Days.\\"  Personally I am not sure these are truly Blind Faith songs.  They just don't sound right, especially the guitar and drums.  They sound more like Rick Grech and Steve Winwood demos.  Specifically, I think what I hear is Rick playing Bass & Violin, and Steve playing everything else, Keyboards, Guitar, Drums.  Yes, multitracked and overdubbed, but with out Eric or Ginger.  Also the late listed recording date of October 1969 makes me suspicious.  The known recording dates otherwise for Blind Faith were from February 20 to June 28, 1969.  The band broke up in November.  If anyone out there knows any more about these or other \\"extra\\" Blind Faith songs, please let the rest of us know.   <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Very impressive stuff.  I am discounting a few things that have been incorporated, in my opinion, to embellish this DVD:  <br /> <br />- Additional studio sound inputs [may be 10% overall] <br />- Gorgeous models in the audience [no way they are Eagles fan:)] <br /> <br />The rest is just pure joy to watch.  The bandmembers seem to be in good form, especially Joe Walsh.  He's great belting our some old James Gang stuff ..  <br /> <br />The DTS recording is excellent, video quality is outstanding and both have been perfected to the point that Concert DVD producers, trying to make a quick buck, may learn a thing or two about presentation and listener/ viewer satisfaction. <br /> <br />One request to the group: loosen up guys, experiment, alter, dance .. that's what the stage is for.  You always don't have to sound so pristine and stick to chords that were created in the comfort of a studio.  What's the word I am looking for? Oh, Improvise! <br /> <br />We are listening ... <br />
1401301010|4.0|Man, Anthony Kiedis has had a cool life.  Even as a youngster he was a madman, stripping naked in front of billboards and leaping from apartment rooftops into swimming pools.  He even had sex with his dad's girlfriend and smoked herb when he was only 11 years old!  Even when he was a homeless junkie, lurking in parking garages to shoot up H, he had relations with unbelievably gorgeous girls.  How does he do it...?  The guy has mojo.<br /><br />I was more into the book at the beginning because I dug the youthful insanity.  After Blood Sugar Sex Magick came out and Anthony became a superstar, he's no longer striving, just buying million-dollar mansions, vast amounts of heroin and coke, and living like your typical rock star.  Anthony drugged solo in motel rooms, really more of a junkie than a partier, and there's also tons of rehab-speak that sounds like it was taken straight from the Big Book...  Not as fun.<br /><br />It's cool to read about the bandmates.  I always thought Flea was the insane bass genius, but he seems normal in this book, staying away from drugs and raising his daughter.  Frusciante is really interesting, since he is pretty much the key to the Chili Pepper's mainstream success-- everything he touches is golden-- and yet he was so conflicted about success.  An autobiography by Frusciante about this period would probably be a bit deeper and more interesting.<br /><br />And after all the madness, Anthony is still peaking as a rock star, with \\"Californication\\" and \\"Scar Tissue\\" still pumping from every radio.  He really has had a blessed life compared to the 9-to-5 pencil pushers, if only he stays away from the needle and the damage done.
B0007ORU66|5.0|Ihave LP copies on Apple Records, both with these two different titles. The original title was \\"Hey Jude\\". I agree with a previous reviewer that it should have contained \\"Get Back\\". This album (I still call CD's Albums) has never been released officially by Apple or Capitol or Parlophone on CD. It is, however, available on this import version. I have two that are both Russian imports. One has Abbey Road on it also as a \\"Two-Fer\\" (with an official looking Apple Label on the CD). The other is the single album (that I'm listening to with headphones while writing this) with nine bonus tracks. It also has the single mono version of \\"Ballad of John
0385484518|5.0|Wow! If you want a book that will stick with you, long after you have put it down, you really NEED to read this book. It makes you question what is really important in life.<br /><br />Do the things that you are concerned about really matter? Clothes?  Cars?  That person at work who seems to be on the phone all day long?  For example, if you spend an extra couple of minutes eating with your family and you don't get around to ironing your shirt before you go out today, will it make THAT big of a difference in the grand scheme of things?<br /><br />The author, Mitch, realizes (with his old professor's help) thoughout the course of this story that it is the people in our lives and our relationships with those people that matter most and that material possessions: fancy jewelry, luxury cars, and big investments will never have quite the payout that a supportive network of family and friends has. In doing so, Mitch is also able to thank the one teacher in his life who really made a difference.<br /><br />This book will make you rethink all of those things that are stressing you out in your everyday life.  It made me ask the question, \\"Is that really going to matter in the long run?\\" about the little things that were making me angry or stressed.  This is definitely a book that EVERYONE should read. I am passing it on to my husband to read next and then to my sister. :)
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I have always been a fan of Disney's movies, mostly their classics. I admit, when this movie first came out, I was a little hesitant. It didn't seem like it would be a memorable Disney film, like 'The Lion King' or 'Beauty and the Beast'. I ended up watching it because my little brothers wanted to see it. I ended up loving it! David Spade and John Goodman are the two main characters. They fight and quarrel all through the movie. Take a chance and see this if you haven't already.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|'Thoughts are tyrants that come back again and again to torment us...'<br /><br />While I think all the versions have something to recommend them, especially Larry Olivier's, this is my favorite by far.<br /><br />To me, this is the most Gothic, right down to the inspired choice of the partially turreted building that serves as Wuthering Heights itself. For the record, the word Wuthering came from the local dialect, and describes the action of the wind.<br /><br />Not only are the casting, production and direction first class, the movie also features some richly nuanced performances by Fiennes and Binoche. All of the above is also carried along by a beautiful and haunting film score.<br /><br />Frankly, I have no idea what the critics are babbling about, nor do I care. Highly recommended.
0385720920|5.0|This book is not so much about the story, but about how the story is presented.  <br /> <br />This book is a philosophical masterpiece that shows you the author's paradigm intellect and complete mastery of how to make the english language both prolific and poetic.

B000929AJQ|3.0|<br />Oh, Trent Reznor. Here's another project that may work. Chances are after listening to \\"the hand that feeds\\", the project of removing chords from the album not only seems atrocious, but it takes the bite that was supposed to be the vocation of teeth. So I'm wondering if nine inch nails' album will still have bite without chords. Let's find out, shall we? The first song, \\"all the love in the world\\" starts off with an embrace of electronic drum machines and pianos for major worrying. The best part of this song, and maybe the album, is that I can understand all that he is saying, and the feeling in his voice clash with the music pretty accurately. In this case, he feels hate and jealously after hurt. \\"Why do you get all the love in the world\\", he laments. After his little situation he uses further piano (and tambourine) not only to create possible melody, but to clash beautifully with his pain. He feels as if in this world, he has no friend, and feels jealousy with one he hates for having what he wants. \\"you know who you are\\" brings back Thriller-Action Industrial music, and with the chorus, I think I hear an electronic chord. I don't know if that even counts. And the answer to that question is that if he actually knew who he is, he would maybe me able to understand why he gets so much pain. Whether this hate machine has enough gasoline to strike or not. \\"the collector\\" stares of with a rather complex beat that last threw us off in \\"march of the pigs\\". The song sounds like the blatant downside to emotional schizophrenia. \\"the hand that feeds\\", sounds like a winner in the beginning, but as soon as the reach the end, it can seem annoying. Remember the directions I gave you the last time I did this song? I said listen to this as many time as you want to on your new subwoofer, but don't blame Reznor if your sister says the chorus to you 10 times each day as either a joke or an insult. \\"love is not enough\\" takes a detour through the dark mind of nine inch nails. He says, \\"underneath the tough, love is not enough\\". Though he never tells us what else there really is, besides possible resentment from society. The closest we can get to \\"hurt\\". \\"every day is exactly the same\\" is proof from Powerman 5000 that yesterday will come tomorrow. No? Or is it that the activism and change in life was only level the whole entire day. Trent Reznor creating his own brand of trip-hop. It can work. This, to me, is a good highlight in the album. \\"with teeth\\" makes us wonder the origin of such a familiar beat. We say the song may have teeth after all. Maybe, the song itself. Well, at least he kept his guns hidden. What can be the most annoying about the song is the chorus. \\"a-with-a teeth-a\\", is what comes out of his mouth. Okay, what about the teeth? This is another one of those songs with chorus that people will start teasing you about one day, if you don't keep it under your headphones. The trouble is the teeth are so busy getting sharpened we hear so much about what makes him tick and boom, and nothing about what would pull him out of such a long slump. \\"only\\" visits a family of dance beats and they are planning to take possible bliss home to mother. Think of Chemical Brothers or Prodigy featuring Trent Reznor. That is what it sounds like. He screams out, \\"there's no you, there is only me!\\" Um, getting a little arrogant, if not lonely, aren't we? \\"getting smaller\\" shows Trent Reznor playing what could be a Velvet Revolver riff, to stab the worst of his life. He feels as if he is tired of being the bigger man, so he gets smaller trying to deal with his rage. \\"sunspots\\" is the closest we can get to the calmest song closer to \\"gave up\\". \\"the line begins to blur\\" is more of the song that kills my theory about being more able to decipher through no chords, but then the studios invented electronics. I would rather not bother with this one. Following the other one comes \\"beside you in time\\", where he finally stops thinking of himself and thinks about the future with people. The background bass line makes the trip through time worth the listen. The last piece \\"right where it belongs\\" can be more of a funeral album for the war between man and machine. How many of you are wondering about the reason for the live screaming? I'm not. Either way, this was called the most personal album, but this sounds less ferocious than the other ones. Call it the \\"Results May Vary\\" of his career. The album may run with them, but the album seems a bit cut down, and repackaged at the same time. Eh, it's okay. Kind of like a red to blue album, in terms of emotion (the way I like it). Get it all out and celebrate what you have.  <br />Rating: 7/10 <br />
B0002EXH5O|4.0|After Dave Mustaine left metallica he came up with a formula for sucess copy every thing metallica does with less talented musicians. If you've heard ...And Justice for all you'll realize what a ripoff this is. But even though this album is unoriginal and Dave Mustaine has the worst voice ever this is still a good album worth buying.
B0000004V2|5.0|I couldn't get enough of this album when it was first released.  It still manages to move me almost 20 years later. An immediate jolt of music-prozac for whenever I'm feeling down.  It is indeed too bad about the subsequent years, but does that really matter? If any of us could shine this brightly albeit for a short time, we'd be there in a heartbeat [and yes, the sound is \\"tinny\\"].
0783225547|3.0|Okay, first the special effects. They're outstanding. From the very first eruption, through dams breaking, floods destroying bridges, and a stupdendous pyroclastic flow, it's some of the best effects I've ever seen in a disaster movie.    Unfortunately, there's a story that comes with it; even more unfortunately, some lamebrain decided to included DIALOGUE. God help us.    Whoever wrote the screenplay must have a pretty low opinion of the intelligence of the human species -- and especially of women. First, there's Marion, Brosnan's first love. Marion loves volcanoes, and is so much of an expert that when she sees that the volcano she's sitting on is about to blow, she wants to stay (\\"we can't leave now; look at these readings!\\") Uh , Marion, have you considered that the readings are saying that it's time to, oh, I don't know... RUN??!! No matter, she doesn't last long.    Then there's Grandma. Boy, if there was ever a senior who deserved to be put away, it's this nut. Don't ever trust someone in their seventies who says \\"hot nookie\\" in front of the grandkids. She also refuses to come off of her volcano when it's ready to explode. Maybe it's something in the water.    My favorite line, however, comes from our heroine. She's sitting out on her front porch one warm summer evening, her soon-to-be beau Brosnan by her side, her two sweet children asleep in her beds. Brosnan has told her the explosion could come any time now.She stares up at the volcano and murmurs \\"I hope you're wrong about our volcano, Harry -- but if you're right, I'm glad you're here.\\" Aw[...] That's nice. Of course, any decent mother would have gotten her kids on the first bus out of town... something she apparently never thought of. She also thanked Brosnan for saving her son's life by making him some eggplant parmegiana. It must be one hell of an eggplant parmegiana.    Throw in the greedy businessman, the chicken boss, a helicopter pilot who apparently was out the day they taught you not to fly inash, and you have the townspeople of Dante's Peak. Happily, you get to see a fantastic volcanic explosion AND the reassurance that these nitwits won't pass on their dna. That alone is worth three stars.
0671027387|3.0|Story is very good but the climax and the reason for the story did not stand upto my expectation.
B0001Z365U|5.0|Spock's Beard is one of the very few new bands i like. They were clearly influenced by bands like Yes and Gentle Giant, and this album is almost as good as many great progressive rock albums from the seventies. It's good to see that some people can still compose great tunes with complex rhythms.  <br />The highlight of this album for me is the title track, 'The Light'.
0143034901|5.0|An excellent story with vivid images and outstanding command of language.  Hard to imagine that this is a translation.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Great movie, history portrayed in an interesting film.  My children, ages 12, 10 and 6 really enjoyed.  However, I Fast Forward through the one intimate scene.  We discussed the immoral behavior that was present.  They loved the military action.
1401200605|5.0|Loeb captures the essence of the characters in all his work being Superman,Spiderman,Hulk Grey or even the Smallville episdoes he works on, telling a detailed story of who they are and why they are the person (or superhero) they have become. In 'HUSH' He writes a brilliant mystery in which the dark knight has to face demons from his past and come to terms with how it shapes his future, I loved the twists and turns, the involvement of all he has taken under his wing and the appearance of Superman just makes it even better. <br /> <br />Then teaming him with Jim Lee was just the best thing DC has done in a long time making this story go from good to master piece. I always think the art should reflect the story, in some comics this is just not happening, there are some books you just glance through because even though the story is good the artwork will not grab your focus...Jim brings this out in everything he does. Even the recent Superman miniseries he worked on with writer Brian Azzarello, the story was lacking in alot of things, Jim's work was the only thing keeping me going from issue to issue. <br /> <br />HUSH is a great read and a must for anyones collection.
B000819PKC|3.0|Whether you'll be let down as well depends on which Jamiroquai you are expecting.  If you're looking for the sweet soul of \\"Emergency on Planet Earth\\", \\"Space Cowboy\\" or \\"Travelling Without Moving\\", this ain't it.  But if your favorite Jamiroquai stuff is the more uptempo dance-flavored jams of \\"Funk Odyssey\\" etc, then you'll like this.  Most of the songs are disco/synth dance tracks designed to rock a dance floor, but with not much soul sensibility at all.   There are only two songs that would sound at home on any of Jamiroroquai's earlier albums, \\"7 Days\\" and \\"Talullah\\".  Even though \\"Talullah\\" resorts to cliched \\"my girl is leaving on a jet plane and I've got to get her back\\" lryics, I've probably listened to it 20 times today because the music is DOPE.  Jay just has a way of writing songs that you can't get enough of no matter how many times you hit rewind. If you are just getting hip to Jamiroquai, don't start your collection with this album.  But if you are a long-time fan, there is enough here to make it a worthwhile purchase (Americans should wait for the U.S. release and pay the lower price - there is nothing here you can't wait a few weeks for).  Even though the album is not nearly what I'd hoped for or expected, it will still dominate my CD changer for a while.  Dude is ridiculously talented and still hasn't gotten his due.
B00007GZR5|5.0|WHERE DO I BEGIN. A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE ONCE MENTION TO ME ABOUT THIS MOVIE SHE WENT TO SEE WITH HER HUSBAND AND THAT IN DID HE WAS MAD AT HER FOR MAKING HIM SEE SUCH AN IGNORANT AND SUPID FILM, BUT FOR HER IT MEANT SO MUCH AND IT JUST MADE THINGS CLEAR FOR HER. I MYSELF DIDNT UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE MEANT AND SHE RECOMENDED THIS FILM FOR ME TO SEE. AS I PREPARE MYSELF TO SIT BACK AND WATCH THIS FILM, I KNEW IT MEANT FOR ME TO GIVE IT NOT 100% BUT MAYBE 200%.  <br /> <br />I SAT BACK AND WATCH THE MOVIE. THIS IS A LOVE STORY I THOUGHT, OK. BUT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ORDINARRY LOVE STORY. THIS IS A STORY OF 2 PEOPLE THAT FIT WITH EACH OTHER, THEY WERE MADE FOR EACH OTHER AND THE GOOD TIMES AND BAD TIMES THAT THEY WENT THRU IN THEIR LIVES, WAS NOT COMPARE THRU THE HELL THEY WERE TO ENDURE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THEIR OWN DEATH.  <br /> <br />YOU SEE, IN THE REALITY OF THIS WORLD PEOPLE TODAY DONT BELIEVE IN SOULMATES. THEY THINK IS SILLY TO EVEN BELIEVE IN SUCH A THING. THE BOOK, THE BOOK JUST FINALLY GAVE ME WHAT I WAS SEARCHING FOR AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE. YOU SEE, THE BOOK IS REAL, WELL TO ME IT IS AND I WILL BELIEVE THIS UP TO THE DAY I DIE. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT CHRIST SOME HOW MANAGE TO MAKE SUCH MANUSCRIPT IN DETAILS THRU A WONDERFULL WOMAN THAT MANAGE TO MAKE IT WITH IN 6 MONTHS AND HAD IT DELIVERED TO HIS BROTHER ROBERT NIELSEN, AND HE GOT IT IN JANUARY, 1978. HIS EXACT WORDS WERE: THE QUESTION, IN MY MIND, ABOUT THIS BOOK ARE MANIFOLD. I WILL NOT ENUMERATE THEM BUT PERMIT THE READER TO FORM HIS OR HER OWN. IF ONLY ONE THING AM CERTAIN. IF THIS MANUSCRIPT IS TRUE, THEN ALL OF US HAD BETTER EXAMINE OUR LIVES ... CAREFULLY.  <br /> <br />IN THE BOOK ALSO HAS A MENTION THAT HAS STUCK BY ME..ALWAYS.. *WHATSOEVER A MAN SOWETH, THAT SHALL HE ALSO REAP* PEOPLE ARE NOT PUNISH FOR THEIR DEEDS BUT BY THEM. IF ONLY EVERYONE BELIEVED THAT. IF ONLY EVERY MEN AND WOMAN IN THE WORLD KNEW - BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUGT - THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FACE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR LIVES. THEWORLD COULD CHANGE OVERNIGHT.* <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE IS NOT JUST A LOVE STORY, IS A MOVIE THAT TEACH US DIFFERENT PATHS IN LIFE. WHAT A LOVE ONE IS READY TO DO FOR THE OTHER, WHEN TRUE LOVE EXIST.  <br /> <br />I MYSELF HAVE SAID ENOUGH, BUT WITH THIS I LEAVE... THE MOVIE ALONG WITH THE BOOK, ARE 2 OF THE MOST INTERESTANT PIECES I HAVE EVER READ AND SEEN. THE MOVIE TOUCHED MY SOUL, BUT THE BOOK CHANGE MY VIEWS COMPLETELY REGARDING LOVE, SINS, HEAVEN AND HELL. <br />
B0000C8AVM|2.0|Call me crazy, but when is an artist in our lifetime going to write something of substance?  Not since Creed's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters.  This one from Bob Dylan doesn't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves.  Some of Dylan's acoustic work is good, and I give him props for his work at the controls, but where is the heart, where is the soul?  Where is the topnotch singing?  This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.   <br /> <br />Now, if you're looking for good rock, check out Bush 'n' Creed.  Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek.  Speaking of geeks, does anyone know when Coldplay's fourth album will hit stores? <br /> <br />KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK...AND KEEP CHECKIN' MY SITE!! <br /> <br />LATER!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's Closer album is the greatest vocal album he has done yet. His debut album shows off his vocal talent, but this one actually brings the fans closer to him. Hence the name Closer. He puts so much emotion into the songs on this album. I would have to say the songs that show off his talents are \\"Remember When It Rained\\" and \\"You Raise Me Up.\\" The first Italian song I learned off of this CD is \\"Per Te\\" which means For You. This is an album you should check out and buy. Josh Groban is a man of many talents! Closer calms me down after a hard day at school, or as a wake up to get ready for school. \\"Remember When It Rained\\" is a song that Josh wrote with Eriq Monquet of Deep Forest. It shows off his piano talents and when he holds that note at the end it just makes you want to die. :P \\"You Raise Me Up\\" definitly shows off his vocal talents with a choir. Josh has his own category for his music. Go out and buy it if you don't already have it, you won't regret it!
0553573403|5.0|By far one of the most gripping, intricate, well written fantasy books i have ever read. Hell, its one of the best books of any genre period. Interesting characters, twisting plot, epic battles, humour....everything is in this one. It is graphic and very &quot;adult&quot; which i loved, this aint a kids fantasy book. I highly reccomend this one to anyone, you will be hooked...............
B00001W9G0|4.0|It's exactly the way it appeared in the movies. I've seen it on regular TV again and again and had forgotten what it's like to see it straight through without the commercial interruptions and without the 1980s era censoring that it had on TV. It's nice to see the special features although I was surprised that the \\"look-back-at-the-making-of-the-movie\\" (whatever they called it) documentary didn't include any interviews with Robert Redford... just Barbara Streisand and Sydney Pollack and others. But it was worth the price of admission! Nothing's wrong with it.
B000805796|5.0|This is Melanie's 3rd CD and her first on her own.  While I noticed that this CD compared to her previous 2 was different in production and such, If you are a fan you will appreciate and like this CD very much.  It is evident that she wasn't going for commercial success or appoval, but with that said, don't take that as meaning that the CD stinks- because it is actually more raw and heartfelt. She stripped away expectations and the current popular music scene's obsession with brainless chart-topping hits with minimal writing skills and came out with a more raw and honest approach to the music she was already making. One major difference, also, is that she is \\"angrier\\" on this CD. Just another side of her as an artist. and by trying new things and getting grittier, i actually believe she is now an artist. If you own her previous 2, don't hesitate to go for the 3rd.  <br />tracks 5,6,7,8,9,10,11 and 12 are richest in how they're written and executed. I give her credit for making music she likes and not catering to being a polished superstar working with the most current well known producers. GOod for HEr!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This cd reminds me so much of Faith No More's \\"King For a Day Fool For a Lifetime\\" The Pioneers are never as successful financially as their followers. If you are interested in where this band came from, you have to listen to Faith No More's older albums which came out over 10 years ago.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently saw the trailer for the new movie Serenity, and turned to a friend of mine to ask if there had been a TV show like it.  He said yes, but said that it had been cancelled.  On a whim I purchased it, and what a great purchase it has turned out to be.   Fantastic charachters and stories have made for a purchase that I have now, less than two weeks since I purchased it, watched all the way through three times.  If this sells enough, and the movie does well, we may resurect the series.  So come on in and join the browncoats.  If youat all like Sci-Fi, this is an amazing voyage!
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely adore this production. Jennifer Ehle's winning smile and superb acting, Colin Firth's fittingly tormented hero/suitor personality and the magnificent settings and backgrounds make this a must have for the Austen fan. The only \\"problem\\" I have with this edition is that when I'm in the mood to watch it, I get hooked immediately, and then I have to spend nearly 6 hours watching the entire thing because I can't stop. Yes, the mother's voice is annoying, and the youngest daughter is far from pretty but otherwise the production is well cast and very, very enjoyable.<br />Definitely 5 stars!<br />Linore Rose Burkard, author, Before the Season Ends<br />[...]
0786715103|5.0|The biggest failure of the UN and a big shame for western society! A must-read for everyone who thinks the world can be healed by words instead of activity.
079284131X|5.0|I first saw Chucky when i was about 6, the crap was scared out of me. Im not scared of it anymore. So i bought the original movie. First i  didnt know what was happening. But the bad side of the DVD is that there is barley special features in it. Overall its a great movie. Ny little cousin got scared of it to.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This isn't the Matrix, although it's been compared to that film.  On the DVD it reads: \\"In the future where freedom is outlawed, outlaws will become heros\\".  The difference: <br /> <br />The Matrix:  This is a film about a computer-created messiah with godlike abilities called \\"The One\\" whose calling is to save humankind from the machines they built. Throughout all three films we are subjected to every religious philosophy ever conceived by mankind mangled into tiny bits and then sautered together to suit the AI. It makes sense a computer would come up with this type of \\"religion\\" having to depend on it's data base of man's religious history to create it.     <br /> <br />Equilibrium:  This is a dystopian story; a government gone wrong with a highly placed government loyalist finally seeing through it and eventually bringing the government down.  The hero in this one is a well-honed, brilliant warrior called a \\"Cleric\\", intelligently schooled in the deadly martial art of Gun Kata--no godlike abilities here--just the best fighter the Palace of Justice has to offer. <br /> <br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film's execution of it's premise; it was well-done.  The acting by all players was topnotch. I also enjoyed the choreography of the fighting scenes and the twists and turns the plot took.  <br /> <br />Add this DVD to your collection if you're a fan of great sci-fi.
B00006FDCD|3.0|i saw it when i was in 4 grade, i was scared so much. now not so much. now i think its a little stupid beacause the clown goes in the sewers. you get the rest. and its about 6 hours. Buy salems lot instead
0380002930|5.0|I think that the first thought of many people when they see Watership Down is \\"A book about rabbits? How. . .cheesy.\\" But truth is, once you get into the story, you begin to not even think about the characters as rabbits, more as complex beings.  <br /> <br />I've read this book at least five times, and enjoyed it increasingly each time through. The storyline, put into three sentences is: A group of rabbit adventurers leave their warren, just before it is destroyed by men. They encounter many dangers, finally settling in a place that is too good to be true. Then they face the problem of not having any females, so they journey to another (rather terrifying) warren to \\"steal\\" some does. Trust me, it's much better when you actually read it. You could not ask for a more exciting, as well as touching plot. The characters are so believable that you begin to really feel their emotions. You will reach the end of this book, lightheaded from holding your breath, and with your jaw somewhere around your knees. <br /> <br />I could go on and on (and on and on and on) about how wonderful this book is. If you pass it off as a babyish book, you will really miss out!
B0009HLDFU|5.0|Everybody has expressed a disdain towards the big ol' COPY PROTECTION sticker slapped on the album. Yes, it prevents many from making copies or importing the album, or albums in this case, to their iPod or other mp3 device. I myself can't rant on at all since my computer didn't have any problem ripping the CD to the hard-drive, and now the album's songs remain on my Dell DJ. But I do agree that the consumer should be able to enjoy the music without having any problems. And yes, the band had nothing to do with the whole copy protection riff-raff, so don't lay the blame on them.    Anywho, dunno why I went into that, but oh well. The Foo Fighters redeemed themselves after the minorly disappointing \\"One By One.\\" Disc one is pure Foo Fighters at their high-octane selves. The first track of the first disc starts off with a bang. \\"Can you hear me?? Hear me screaming?!?\\" God, it's been a while since an album started out so loud, so hard, and so anthemic. It's so powerful, giving an adreneline-rush that you're so glad you've bought the album, at least that's how I felt. Sure, \\"One By One\\" started out like that, but steadily declined as songs progressed. \\"In Your Honor\\" doesn't disappoint. It grabs you and never lets go.    Disc two is a complete surprise. It's the Foos unplugged (duh). Like Nirvana's masterful \\"Unplugged in New York\\" performance, disc 2 showed that the Foos are capable of creating beautiful songs. So soft and melodic. My favorite would have to be \\"What If I Do?\\" Yes, in many cases, experimenting is a risk, but do the Foos care? Most likely not, and that doesn't take away the quality of the album... it makes it all the more powerful and unique. \\"Friend of a Friend\\" is perhaps the most powerful track here. Dave Grohl opens up about his time with Nirvana. Quite amazing that this song is incredibly old (supposedly written during his time with Nirvana), but now it finally gets to shine here.    Looking at how low the price is for this album is very surprising. Only $13.99 for a double album. You're basically getting way more than you bargained for. That's something I wish most classic double albums can also do. Will classic albums like \\"The Wall\\" or the Beatles' \\"White Album\\" have a price that low? Most likely not... it's something that we can only dream about.    \\"In Your Honor\\" is a fantastic album. Hard-rocking mosh anthems, then easing down to a soft acoustic set. Both discs are truly amazing. I've heard past Foo albums... call me a schmuck, but I would call \\"In Your Honor\\" the best Foo Fighters album made. C'mon... a hard rock disc, an unplugged disc, a song about Kurt, songs featuring John Paul Jones and Norah Jones, and a price tag of $13.99... you're definately getting something out of this entire album (and thankfully, no damn political-driven tracks). \\"In Your Honor\\" is one definately to be treasured by this reviewer. It's pure rock music... something lacking these days.
B00067ZONA|4.0|I guess you can split the life of Genesis into four phases:<br /><br />1. Before Peter Gabriel left. Intricate prog-rock, detailed attention to the lyrics, very middle-class.<br /><br />2. After Gabriel left, but before the band \\"sold out\\". Produced a surprisingly good first album (Trick of the Tail) which had even Gabriel worried, plateaued with Wind and Wuthering, and then got steadily worse.<br /><br />3. After Collins agreed, in his own words, with the rest of the band \\"Let's Sell Out\\". Marked by the 'We Can't Dance' album, that admittedly did contain a very catchy single. The decision to go commercial was driven in part by the diminishing returns from the Victorian themes of 'Trick of the Tail' and the need to pay increasing palimony bills.<br /><br />4. After Collins left. Judging by the dire track from 'Calling All Stations' featured here, the band was right to shut up shop immediately.<br /><br />As other reviewers have commented, the best CD of the three in this compilation is CD#3, which features the earliest material. There are the expected concert favourites -- lots of riffs and power chords -- but that leaves the best tracks alone -- e.g. 'Fountain of Salmacis' and 'Looking for Someone'.<br /><br />So if you like CD#3 and you're otherwise unfamiliar with Genesis, there are plenty of good Genesis albums for you to buy. I would recommend starting with 'Trick of the Tail', 'Lamb Lies Down' and 'Selling England', the last of which is the closest to being the definitive Genesis album, in my book.
B00008G7UJ|1.0|I am a huge Shakespeare fan and love many of his works!! I love the way he wrote, the old english words he used, I love it all!! When I was in High School in the mid 90's, my English class read the original Romeo & Juliet play by Shakespeare and then after we read the play, we watched the 1936 Black & White film and I just totally loved it for the acting and drama, and it was romantic and followed the play very well. Now Romeo & Juliet is my favorite Shakespeare play!!<br /><br />A while after this 1996 film was released, when it came to video stores to rent, I decided to rent it. I thought it would be good because I liked Claire Danes and Leonardo in other shows and movies. Well I can honestly say that after watching this 1996 version, Shakespeare must have been rolling over in his grave!! I hate to talk so negatively about a film based on Shakespeare's masterpiece but I have to be honest!! This film should NOT have William Shakespeare's name in the title. I was very, very appalled by the very, very drastic changes they made to what Shakespeare meant it to be!<br /><br />Here are some things in this version that just made me sick:<br /><br />1. The dialog does not match what you see on screen. There is this line \\"drop your sword.\\" Hello?? They were carrying guns!!! I mean, come on!!! If You're going to makes changes to a play, at least do it right!!!<br /><br />2. The guns!! Nowhere in Shakespeare's masterpiece play does it mention the characters with guns!! They had swords and daggers, not guns!!<br /><br />3. The rock, alternative, and dance music does not fit, it's meant to be classical!!<br /><br />4. The famous balcony scene was a total disgrace!! Romeo is supposed to be right below Juliet's balcony and Juliet is supposed to be up at her balcony when she says the famous \\"Romeo, Romeo, Where For Art Thou Romeo?\\" They totally messed this up in the 1996 film when Juliet says that line only when she says it, she is walking right by Romeo on the ground where he was!! I was really, really looking forward to the famous balcony scene the way Shakespeare meant it to be right before I saw the part in this 1996 version but I was so appalled that they killed the scene!!<br /><br />5. Claire Danes and Leonardo didn't have enough emotion and passion to be Romeo & Juliet overall!! The couple romantic scenes this film did have, it was alright but I expect superb acting and drama between the two star crossed lovers!!!<br /><br />6. This 1996 film was ruined from the very beginning with the newscaster and TV!!<br /><br />7. There were cars in this film!! There were NO cars in Romeo & Juliet!!!<br /><br />8. I felt like I was watching a Ganster film and not a romantic film overall. I mean, there was a feud between the two families in the play but this film took it way too far like when they were always shooting and killing each other, to an extent that made me feel like I was watching more Ganster than Romance!<br /><br />9. There is acid using in this film!! People using acid drugs?? Oh my god, I feel so sorry for Shakespeare, so sorry that his masterpiece play is being treated this way!! I just cannot comprehend how they could treat his legacy like this!! I am just so, so appalled beyond words!<br /><br />The only saving factor in this, is they kept the old english words/dialog and a couple of Romeo & Juliet romantic scenes but I will stick to the REAL Romeo & Juliet films, the 1936 Black & White and the 1968 version, those are REAL Romeo & Juliet adaptions that don't disgrace and disrespect Shakespeare!the famous balcony scene the way Shakespeare meant it to be right before I saw the part in this 1996 version but I was so appalled that they killed the scene!!     5.

B0000DIJO2|5.0|Listen, if you already like the Bee Gees, than there's no question that you'll love this.  If you don't know there music, watch this and you'll definitely become a fan - fast.  This is one of my all time favorites and they certainly didn't miss too many songs from the 30 year songbook.  If I could change only 1 thing about the whole show it would be having a longer version of Nights on Broadway.  These guys are/were great..
B000060OFT|1.0|I am a huge Shakespeare fan and love many of his works!! I love the way he wrote, the old english words he used, I love it all!! When I was in High School in the mid 90's, my English class read the original Romeo & Juliet play by Shakespeare and then after we read the play, we watched the 1936 Black & White film and I just totally loved it for the acting and drama, and it was romantic and followed the play very well. Now Romeo & Juliet is my favorite Shakespeare play!!<br /><br />A while after this 1996 film was released, when it came to video stores to rent, I decided to rent it. I thought it would be good because I liked Claire Danes and Leonardo in other shows and movies. Well I can honestly say that after watching this 1996 version, Shakespeare must have been rolling over in his grave!! I hate to talk so negatively about a film based on Shakespeare's masterpiece but I have to be honest!! This film should NOT have William Shakespeare's name in the title. I was very, very appalled by the very, very drastic changes they made to what Shakespeare meant it to be!<br /><br />Here are some things in this version that just made me sick:<br /><br />1. The dialog does not match what you see on screen. There is this line \\"drop your sword.\\" Hello?? They were carrying guns!!! I mean, come on!!! If You're going to makes changes to a play, at least do it right!!!<br /><br />2. The guns!! Nowhere in Shakespeare's masterpiece play does it mention the characters with guns!! They had swords and daggers, not guns!!<br /><br />3. The rock, alternative, and dance music does not fit, it's meant to be classical!!<br /><br />4. The famous balcony scene was a total disgrace!! Romeo is supposed to be right below Juliet's balcony and Juliet is supposed to be up at her balcony when she says the famous \\"Romeo, Romeo, Where For Art Thou Romeo?\\" They totally messed this up in the 1996 film when Juliet says that line only when she says it, she is walking right by Romeo on the ground where he was!! I was really, really looking forward to the famous balcony scene the way Shakespeare meant it to be right before I saw the part in this 1996 version but I was so appalled that they killed the scene!!<br /><br />5. Claire Danes and Leonardo didn't have enough emotion and passion to be Romeo & Juliet overall!! The couple romantic scenes this film did have, it was alright but I expect superb acting and drama between the two star crossed lovers!!!<br /><br />6. This 1996 film was ruined from the very beginning with the newscaster and TV!!<br /><br />7. There were cars in this film!! There were NO cars in Romeo & Juliet!!!<br /><br />8. I felt like I was watching a Ganster film and not a romantic film overall. I mean, there was a feud between the two families in the play but this film took it way too far like when they were always shooting and killing each other, to an extent that made me feel like I was watching more Ganster than Romance!<br /><br />9. There is acid using in this film!! People using acid drugs?? Oh my god, I feel so sorry for Shakespeare, so sorry that his masterpiece play is being treated this way!! I just cannot comprehend how they could treat his legacy like this!! I am just so, so appalled beyond words!<br /><br />The only saving factor in this, is they kept the old english words/dialog and a couple of Romeo & Juliet romantic scenes but I will stick to the REAL Romeo & Juliet films, the 1936 Black & White and the 1968 version, those are REAL Romeo & Juliet adaptions that don't disgrace and disrespect Shakespeare!round where he was!!

1891252089|4.0|This book is a classic and David Swenson is well loved by the yoga community. I'll admit that I find the design of the book and the quality of the black and white photos a little too rough and homespun for my tastes. (David did the design and layout himself). But, you can look at the excerpted pages and decide for yourself if production values are of import. Overall, I find David's voice friendly, supportive and unassuming. He does provides alternatives and modifications of poses for lesser able students. This book covers a lot of information, including Primary Series and Intermediate Series.<br /><br />Between owning this book and \\"Astanga\\" by Jean Hall (0754810747) which has lots of luscious color photos featuring a variety of models, especially Jean Hall,  I have access to a balanced presentation of Astanga.
0553582461|5.0|I started my adventure with this series with \\"Fool's Errand'. I just bought it after reading first 40 pages, thinking it may be good. <br />But I was wrong. I definietely LOVED it.  <br />Then I rushed to get the next book of the Tawny Man Series, Golden Fool. I wasn't disappointed. But a lot of things seemed quite strange for me.  No wonder i bought the \\"Assasin\\" series, and read it one by one.  <br />And I loved it even more. Then  I re-read the whole series carefully. And finally, took the third book, Fool's Fate. <br />*spoilers ahead if you haven't read the book* <br /> <br />I have to say, I am very disappointed with the ending. I know, I know. I wasn't expecting something like happy-and-lovely-ending-for-everyone, but anyway. It hurt me. From all the beginning, as I started reading \\"Assasin\\" series, I was getting to know, like or dislike the characters it was all about. I mean, how can she end  relationship with the Fool like that? I was crying when they were at the Black Man's cottage and had that conversation about parting their ways. I had to read all of this few times, because I simply couldn't believe that. Perhaps it's just because I loved the Fool, and he became my favourite character not only in this series, but of all fantasy characters, for now. Okay, I can handle that. The Fool had always seen, even if not clearly, what he had to face, and Fitz can't expect him to be happy after he brings him back to life, and, as he himself says \\"I'm just...I'm outside of my time, Fitz. I'm a fish in the air or a bird beneath the sea. I'm past my life and I grope forward through each day, wondering what I am meant to do with myself. It's hard. It's very hard for me\\". I can understand that. Welcome to human reality. I feel for him. But, whether he likes it or not, he will have to learn to live with it. As he said, \\"his years will be long\\". Very well.  <br />Then, here it goes again. The Fool admitted that in his visions, he had seen Fitz enjoying his true life after his death. And it was the one thing that made him go on, even if he'd known how  terribly he was to die. He faced it. Okay, but don't tell me they couldn't all get along somehow! I am sorry, but it is not someone you know for a year or two, and then just say goodbye to him. This relationship deserves more attention. I won't accept it. (And who cares...)  <br />While progressing through all of the books, I got to love that little jester who was always there for Fitz. He was not an assasin, nor a prince or magician. He didn't posess any of Wit or the Skill. (until he touched Verity's hands, of course). His only weapon was his biting tongue. When in \\"Assasin's Quest\\" they were about  setting out on a journey to find the king, the Fool didn't ask queen if he could come with the rest. For him, it was abvious. When Fitz goes, he does, too. And the same goes For Fitz. Through the whole journey he cared for his friend deeply, many times he was concerned about his \\"changing time\\", his fevers, or when he was very cold. They even shared Fitz's bond with Nighteyes, my second favourite character. Earlier, in \\"Royal Assasin\\", nobody but Fitz noticed that the Fool was attacked and took a beating, and took care of him. As it turned out, (Fool's Errand) there wasn't anyone in the whole world who would know that much of Fitz's life, except the Fool. (Not to mention Nighteyes, of course, but it wasn't human) He could tell him everything about himself, without fear of being judged or rebuked for his recklessness. The Fool wasn't a hero, a fighter or else. He loved carving, beautiful things, making puppets and pretty stuff. Through all the time he was lord Golden, and Fitz acted as his servant, I feared with him, when it seemed that the Fool had even more facets than we know. I loved it, when lord Golden's mask was cracking, and the Fool was giving Fitz his old, jesting smile.  <br />I hated that fight between the two (in Golden Fool). First off, i was curious and confused about why lord Golden caused such situation and talk around the keep. But then I agreed his actions were appropriate. If I were Fitz, I wouldn't care what others say. To have such close friend is a real treasure. Especially for him.  <br /> <br />It's all about the change. \\"You can say you hate change, but you are change.\\" right? Fate, changes. Can't just someone do something for the sake of his own happiness and joy at last? Well, perhaps I am taking this all too personal. But it just seems to me, that the Fool was the most precious friend in his life. While other believed he was dead, things were changing, this one remained the same. Sometimes I just get the strange feeling Fitz's heart is made of stone. He even hardly mentions Nighteyes in book 2&3! I was crying when he left. His sarcastic and wise comments made me always smile. Fitz always reaches Molly in his memory, his daughter whom he never saw, mourns for Verity, but where's Nighteyes?! Why the heck, after that many years together, Fitz so swiftly forgets about his animal mate? It actually saved his life. Thanks to their bond, Fitz could live for some time in Nighteyes' body, and then return to his own. <br /> <br />Okay, I can deal with that. But why is the Fool being so sure and firm when they have that last conversation? I can't stand that. He doesn't ask, compromise or talk it over. No, he's already decided. The Black Man said that if he and Fitz carry on together, it would bring many changes, which no one could foresee. \\"To him, you give your time, your talk, your friendship. Who then does not receive your time? Hm? A big change, maybe\\" Oh yeah, realy great change. So great it will surely change the world again. I can't understand that thing with Molly, too. Hello, they've been apart for so many years, she knows NOTHING about his true life, about what he is/was doing! Is it love, when you don't share who you are with the other person and you keep on lying and promising impossible? More than that, she'd married Burrich. Don't just tell me that through the whole life, living as a hermit or not, visiting many places, he couldn't forget her. That's just too much time for me. She isn't the only woman in the whole world, though. It seems tasteless for me. First off, they're \\"together\\" (if you can call that late meetings in order to we all know what). Then, for 16 years she shares his life with Burrich. They have six kids together. And then, after Burrich gets eliminated from the game, what, Fitz just comes back and slowly everything gets alright? Oh. I have to admit that author does a great job here, through the whole series I have that filthy, returning desire to strike Fitz in the head or kick him. He's poor, life doesn't spare him trouble and worries.  <br /> <br />Then, still there's something that makes me feel sick. Fitz gets back those Skill scrolls, and of course he stucks somewhere for a month. Of course everyone thinks he's dead (including the Fool, who wanted to speak to him, and sought for him on his own. Without any result, obviously. He was very worried.) So this is how it ends? They couldn't even bid each other farewell? Could it be any more messed up? Poor one, he can only leave some stuff for Fitz, which are some beautifully carved scenes of them and Nighteyes together. No one thinks Fitz would claim it anyway. And then he just returns, but it's too late. And that poem... It was just too much for me. I got used to them both sticking together. Fitz and the Fool separated? Okay. But breaking that bond that links them? It's like denying everything they've ever shared and been through... And when Fitz unpacks those treasures from the Fool, and he hears his voice, as he was there with him: \\" I have never been wise\\"... <br />For me, it is very sad and depressing. I know, I'm a girl, I see it from another point, and Fitz is strictly heterosexual. It's a problem because the Fool \\"sets no limits on this love\\". Unfeasible relationship, yeah. Perhaps that's why it is so beautiful.  <br /> <br />But despite those things, or flaws like lack of administration, little variety of people living in Buckkeep and around... Still the story is great. It made me wonder and think about all the events and plot... The whole thing about the White Prophet and his Catalyst sometimes really unnerves me, because I start to wonder, is this love caused only by the fact they two always sticked together because of their task which was to set the world into the better path? If there was someone else his Catalyst, was it the same? So many questions. I am sure I will re-read those series many times. It never bores me. <br /> <br />This is the greatest book I've ever read... But i won't accept the way it ends.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00080ZG10|5.0|Sentiment, intelligence, spectacle, bravura, tragedy - \\"The Aviator\\" is terrific entertainment and then some, a picture immersed in the filmmaking passion of Martin Scorsese and the acute talent of Leonardo DiCaprio, who was once primed to just about disappear from Hollywood. The subject of Howard Hughes is tall for either alone, but combined they fly close to the heat of the man and pull it off without it being hokey or pretentious.  <br /> <br />Hughes made the most expensive movies in his day, and this one isn't cheap - Scorsese will never likely make something so lush again - but sometimes $100 million can be harnessed into a picture worthy of the figure. \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" and its artificial myths may have won the biggest awards of the year, but this is the picture that goes in the vault and is unearthed fifty years from now, a glorious, golden-tinted classic. <br /> <br />Using as many special effects as he's probably ever used in any of films combined, Scorsese sheds light on Hughes' three passions: movies, airplanes and women. He's commanding with all three, and only a few of the women push back, no less than Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale).  <br /> <br />Scorsese creates the Hepburn relationship as a pivot in Hughes' life: Before meeting her, he's a playboy/flyboy/director making the most expensive movies in Hollywood history and making money off them; during, he experiences love's give and take, eventually losing Hepburn to his financial (and mental) obligations; after, he descends further into obsessive-compulsive disorder, anger and desolation.  <br /> <br />Blanchett deservedly won the Academy Award for her work as Hollywood's most decorated actress: Like Hepburn, Blanchett is pretty impressed with her abilities and given to a kind of good-natured grandstanding; she'd be arrogant if her persona were any weaker. Her exit from the movie shifts Hughes toward building his airline, Trans World, and its rivalry with thePan-Am empire and its mogul, Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin, just about perfect), while U.S. Sen. Brewster (Alan Alda, just about perfect) bears down on Hughes for his \\"Spruce Goose\\" military project that eventually became a 47 million boondoggle. Hughes, nearly killed in a XF-11 test plane crash over Beverly Hills, secludes himself in his personal movie theater, on the brink of permanent insanity, before emerging to face Trippe and Brewster in a Senate hearing. In a low moment, it's Gardner who helps rescue him.  <br /> <br />Whether DiCaprio looks like Hughes or not - he doesn't  - is discarded after five minutes. This is a signature performance, his \\"Michael Corleone,\\"  a logical evolution of his work in \\"Catch Me If You Can,\\"  that ensures he'll have leads in prestige pictures for years to come. DiCaprio was sincere in studying OCD and he creates a convincing portrait of a man functioning, but faltering a bit more with each personal and professional setback. Like Jack Nicholson and, yes, Marlon Brando, DiCaprio is sly enough to slip in reminders that he's relishing the role - considering his facial gestures and body movement near the end of lunch with Sen. Brewster and you understand the lovely difference between strict method and this performance.  <br /> <br />Hughes is often remembered as a freak show who spent the last 20 years secluded in a bungalow, dying with heroin syringes stuck in his arms, jars of his own waste surrounding him. Scorsese hints at that in the extended theater scene; DiCaprio's triumph is to take us there without simply gawking. We pity Hughes in his lesser, sicker moments - such as when he interviews a 15-year-old girl by spotlight - and gain a respect for his fortitude otherwise. Hughes is flawed - a paranoid, power-hungry, occasionally cruel man - but  fearlessly driven and capable of great things. If that isn't a portrait of an American, nothing is.
1400032717|5.0|\\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is a uniquely formulated novel about an autistic boy, Christopher, who embarks on an investigation to find the murderer of a neighbor's dog.  The story is told in first person by Christopher.  Within the landscape of the novel, the author is able to create an atmosphere where the reader not only understands the inner workings of Christopher's autistic mind, but we are also able to connect with Christopher on a human level.  Christopher's investigation into the murder of Wellington leads him to a discovery that his highly logical mind struggles to process.  With this discovery, Christopher embarks on a journey of self-preservation that that proves his intellect and independence.  This is one of the best novel's I've read this year and I will be recommending it for years to come.

630469654X|5.0|Ladyhawk is my all time favorite movie (along with my favorite music).  Ever since I saw it as a little girl I have been intrigued by this film.  It has all the elements of a great film.  There is love, tragedy, action, and comic relief.  In my opinion the music in this film is esquisite.  To say it doesn't fit suggest that those people have a weak imagination.  This music is what drew me to the film.  It has a heroic yet tradgic love all in one.  If you can't hear that you must be deaf.  There are several clips that I love because of the music itsef.  The score at the beginning, the first fight with Nauva, when he is looking at sunset, when Isabeau first apears, when Isabeau is hurt, when the hawk flies over the water, when they almost touch, and the end when they do touch.  So there you have it. Those are just a few parts that give me butterflies in my stomach because of the MUSIC!  So like I said before if those of you can't see that poo on you.
0780622553|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite sci-fi movies of all time. I even liked this movie more than the matrix. I've heard some people say that some of the dialogue of the movie was corny or dumb, I think they weren't suppose to be serious...they were suppose to be funny and they were. I also think that keifer sutherland was brilliant in this movie and I don't care what anyone says...I loved his \\"out of breath\\" voice. So, bottom line...if you haven't seen this movie I beg you to see it right now, you'll thank me for it.
047119350X|1.0|This is the main text for second semester biochemistry at Yale University.  Compared to Lehninger, it is more detailed and very up to date but it lacks discussion on basic principles and fails to treat any of the topics deeply.  Because it attempts to consolidate a good amount of recent material, it ends up presenting data that has not been confirmed.  Sometimes the author presents a caveat regarding whether a theory is backed or not, but more often this becomes implicit and the reader quickly finds himself looking many of the experiments up for confirmation.  Overall this is a decent book for information, but I would not recommend it when there are so many better books out there.
6304806418|5.0|First of all ... I think people that take the time to type up movie reviews forget what they're typing about, exactly.  Everybody says that Eva Peron lived a shallow-hallow life.  Okay, that's fine ... but then why discredit the movie for depicting this exact situation?  During the movie we, as viewers, are \\"emotionally distanced\\" from Madonna as Evita, but ... in real life that's exactly how her subjects felt, too, right?  So how does the movie \\"fail\\" on that account? <br /> <br />And as far as Madonna goes ... this was pretty much the first (and last) time I ever saw her \\"acting\\" in every sense of the word.  She was, by far, quite convincing.  Way to go on that Golden Globe win! <br /> <br />But I do understand the tediousness of sitting through two-plus hours of complete and utter singing and emoting.  There was simply NO downtime at all ANYWHERE during the course of the movie.  It works best watching it at home on television ... at least then you can pause and start and pause and start at will.  I pity those that actually had to sit through this in a theater.
B0009NZ3BO|5.0|July 1, 2005, New York, NY - Iconic progressive rock band Gentle Giant are currently celebrating the 35th anniversary of their formation with the release of seven of their most popular albums, all re-mastered and re-packaged in a special 35th anniversary edition and containing previously unreleased material. Unfortunately, due to a mistake by the manufacturer, the 35th anniversary edition of Interview, which in-stored on June 21, was produced in mono and will be pulled from all store shelves.

B0002OERI0|1.0|Pure, unequivocal garbage.  You want some punk? listen to the ramones or velvet underground.  If you want mass-produced music for easily-entertained apes, then this is your buy!  Its not the fact that this album is so popular that its garbage, because modest mouse got wrote a decent album recently that was moderately popular.  The fact is that this band writes mediocre music, with no substance whatsoever.  I've heard children's albums with more depth and heart than this.  But i know that most people are stupid, and stupid people are into this kind of thing, so enjoy! :)
B00003CX5A|4.0|Tim Burton always has a distinctive style, except Planet of the Apes which could've been directed by anyone. So after a box office failure with Mars Attacks!, he returns to the more gothic dark flavor which can be seen in Batman and Beetlejuice. Plotwise, it's not the best but visually it hits its mark. <br /> <br />It's a pretty common story but as usual, Tim takes a story and changes it a bit. Here we have Ichabod Crane, a New York constable with ideas about experimental medical gadgets, he gets assigned to a small town called Sleepy Hollow, where grisly murders have taken place. People have been found decapitated, their heads missing. <br /> <br />Arriving in the town, he finds himself not being really welcomed by the townsfolk who tend to have big secrets. But soon, Ichabod starts to learn and try to solve who's behind the murderer: a former Hessian mercenary who came back from the grave as the Headless Horseman. <br /> <br />Before I get into the look, I have to mention the plot. You know that segment in a movie where the villain explains the plot and puts all of its small details into order? Well this has it and you're still like wtf? One character goes \\"five victims and four graves\\" and we know one was a woman. You already know why there's 5 isn't there? And yet they actually spend some minutes on this? <br /> <br />Now for the look of the film. Sure it's not some spectacular landscape images or beautiful gardens, but oddly enough it looks beautiful. However there is one scene where Ichabod's mom in a flashback spins around and the camera pans around them. Great shot. One thing that isn't really here is his distinctive sense of humor. There's scenes that he might find hysterical but you're a little huh? After a kid asks someone if they know of the Headless Horseman, a woman does that finger across the neck and he goes \\"that'd be him.\\" Ooh, knee slappingly funny. <br /> <br />Johnny Depp proves he's still one of the better actors this generation with his portrayal of Ichabod as someone who thinks he's buff and macho but deep down he's quite squeamish and awkward. However he was little to no chemistry with Christina Ricci. And hey look: a bunch of Sith Lords in one movie. We got Ian McDiarmid(Emperor in Star Wars), Ray Park(Headless Horseman in fight scenes but he's Darth Maul) and Christopher Lee(Count Dooku but here he's Ichabod's superior). <br /> <br />The film is rather suspenseful but not scary, quite gory but not vomit inducing. It's the kind of film that when there's no action or great looking scenery, you want the action and fortunately this has it.

B00005JL78|5.0|Based on a Philip K. Dick short story, Minority Report is about a cop in the future working in a division of the police department that arrests killers before they commit the crimes courtesy of some future viewing technology. Cheif John Anderton has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future crime and must find out what brought it about and stop it before it can happen<br /><br />Steven Speilberg has created a Sci-Fi masterpiece that is full of action, is smart, and is thrilling. He takes Philip K. Dick's story and makes it his own, creating visual and mental candy for us to watch on the screen. He adds his own signature brand of directing by adding a emotional level to the film and making us feel for the characters and what they are going through. He takes the actors and makes them perform like it is their last movie, they all give great performances that would last long times.<br /><br />Tom Cruise probably gives his second best performance(his first being in Born On The Fourth Of July) as Chief John Anderton. We can feel the intenisty and pain of him after he loses his son and the pain that he suffers through everyday. He makes the film seem so much greater and stronger because his peformance is intense and emotionally there. Samantha Morton was suprisingly wonderful in this as one of the pre-cogs. She really almost made you cry because she delivers some of the most powerful monologues in the film and her acting chops show here with her beautiful peformance. Colin Farrell is brutal. His character really makes you want to hate him and loathe him. He is such a nice guy at first.<br /><br />Let me tell you, Philip K. Dick has some of the most intellgent and thought provoking stories that are getting picked up by movie studios. His stories are being made into films like Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly and this. But, all of them might not stay true to them, but this movie has taken the story and stayed true to it all the way through the film. I commend Steven for making such a fine adaptation of it and hope that he has more future adaptations of Philip K. Dick short stories.<br /><br />Overall, the film was a great sci-fi tale heightened by great peformances with solid direction by Steven Spielberg, and a great starting story to make the film on.Steven for making such a fine adaptation of it and hope that he has more future adaptations of Philip K.

B00006DEF9|5.0|Watching this movie takes me back to my youth. This had to be one of the best put together combinations of dancers ever. Amazing is about all I can say. I love the Special Editions. They are put together with Love. I learn so much which makes my next viewing of the movie special. Talk about a great gift for those of us born before the 70's. No I take that back, my 29 year old daughter and 7 year old grandson love it as much as me!!
B00006IUL7|5.0|I am shocked at how many 1 or 2 star ratings this movie got. It does have some faults like a predictable ending but that didn't ruin it whatsoever for me. The movie could have had a better and unpredictable ending but everything else was almost perfect. Besides some confusing moments and the predictable ending, everything clicks right for this movie.  <br />The acting is superb, notably by Robin Williams, but also by Al Pacino and Hilary Swank. The visuals are gorgeous showing Alaskan landscapes. The score is perfect, and the plot is brilliant. I never saw the other version of this movie and didn't read the book (is it based on the book?) but loved this movie. The flashbacks were great as were the killer's phone calls.  <br />This movie had some faults but so do all movies and sometimes, these crazy plot twists at the end of movies seem really unrealistic and degrade the movie. This doesn't have a plot twist at the end because it didn't need one,and the predictable but neat ending didn't ruin the movie whatsoever. <br />The plot of this movie is about 2 LA cops that come to Alaska to investigate a girl's murder. But Detective Dormer (Al Pacino) can't sleep because it's always light out there. And when an incident occurs that Dormer covers up by blaming the killer, things get complicated...because the killer saw him do it... <br />I strongly recommend this movie to everyone as it's a fascinating movie that will stick with you. I find it even worth a buy but if you want to see movies with plot twists or highly unpredictable endings, check out movies like Memento, The Usual Suspects, etc..
B00005RFAI|1.0|Remember Avril Lavigne? Britney Spears? We could go as far back as Bon friggin' Jovi! Why am I asking this? Because Pink and the previous;y mentioned artists are/were the reason why music is dying today. Its all about image, for Pink its trying to be bad ass by dying your hair pink...ANYONE COULD DO THAT! 95% marketing 5% pink hair, thats it. I've heard 'My Vietnam', 'Family Portrait', 'Just Like A Pill', and the worst song of the millenium 'Get this party Started'. Are you the next Vince Niel!? Stop singing about partying, that trend died in '91! And Vietnam was a terrible time in US and world history, I bet if Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains heard that song you'd be in a morgue by this time tomorrow, because people like Jerry know how bad Vietnam was, considering he lost his FATHER there, you selfish b***h! I dont think I need to write any more, and besides, nobody even knows who \\"Pink\\" is now...
B00000JBFW|5.0|I'm not a die hard fan of deep purple,maybe because i like AC/DC \\"alot\\" better, BUT THE SONGS MAKE THE MUTYHA****ING BIG BOOBS BOUNCE!!!! <br />     out of the deep purple catalog,i only have have two albums :this one and MACHINE HEAD.This album rocks my stereo out <br />the best songs are \\"knocking at your back door\\",\\"meanstreak\\",\\"not responsible\\",and alot more;But the one song that stands out...is PERFECT STRANGERS its their best song,go out and add a \\"classic to your collection\\".
0553583182|1.0|This book says, in essence, that if you think positively you'll do better. This book was pretty dumb. Make that very dumb. The world needs a lot fewer people telling other people to harness their subconscious mind. Real problems have real difficulties. This is too much akin to wishful thinking.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I know this is not a horror film, but I must say, it scared me. The scariest thing was that rabbit. The story is really complicated. And also, like Night of the Living Dead, there seems to be no hope, and when it ends, it is a really depressing movie. This movie is EXTREMELY well acted, directed, written, photographed; its just awesome. I recommend it to everyone: horror fans, sci-fi fans, or anyone who appreciates good cinema.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is the best show I have seen in a long time - possibly ever. It's a show for teens but smart enough for adults too.  I love this show so much.  If people would just watch it they too would love it!  The show is perfect in every aspect, the writers are geniuses, and the cast is phenomenal.  If you want some more substance in your tv programming, buy this set of dvds and watch season 2 on UPN Wednesday nights at 9.
B00097A5HW|5.0|You'll see my first review under MJL - Told you in an earlier review that this gets better each time you listen to it.  The album has incredible depth.  Shakira Meburak doesn't have the best voice in latin music, but what she does do is change the modulation of her voice according to the mood of the song. <br /> <br />Las canciones \\"No\\" y \\"La Pared\\" son muy tristes y su voz mostra eso.  Las canciones \\"Un Dia Especial\\" y \\"Obtener en Si\\" ilustre mucha esperanza.  Shakira no es simple un cantante, como Jennifer Pena.  El puro talento de esta mujer es simplemente increible. <br /> <br />Aside from the voice, these songs show another facit of her talent: songwriting.  These are extremely catchy, whether she is creating a ballad or other type of song.  This CD gets more and more irresistable every time one listens to it. <br /> <br />Por ejemplo, la cancion \\"Obtener un Si\\" no parece fuerte la primera vez, pero gustara lo despues cinco veces de escuchando. <br /> <br />Finally, is there a more successful story in all of music right now than \\"La Tortura\\".  Check any latin radio station's top ten in Latin America or the United States and you will see La Tortura.  It has been on top since May.  Check out Now 19 (normally just major hits on these CD's) however, they couldn't ignore \\"La Tortura\\" even with it being in another language. <br /> <br />If you are considering buying this just based on \\"La Tortura\\", let me tell you that \\"La Tortura\\" is just the tip of the iceberg.  You are in for a real treat on this one. <br /> <br />En Deciembre su CD ingls har la musica en ingles mucho mejor.  Cada estrella de la musica Americana necesitar a trabajar mas despues Shakira (Oral Fixacion). <br />
1863513418|5.0|Gorgeous book, vintage Nicholas - HOWEVER, please be advised that this is merely a combination of her Stumpwork Embroidery Designs & Projects and Stumpwork Embroidery Fruits Flowers & Insects.  There are no new projects.  No review that I have read bothers to mention this.
B000002LVB|5.0|Revered or dispised by fans, I'm one of those who finds \\"Loaded\\" to be one of the masterpieces of its generation.  Granted, Lou Reed abandoned all the things that made the old Velvet Underground what it was, but this is a good straightahead rock record, full of fantastic songwriting, sarcasm, and brilliance. <br /> <br />So what makes \\"Loaded\\" so good?  Stunning songwriting ably supported by sympathetic musicians.  Reed, at the height of his powers as a rock and roll composer pulled off at least two classic songs that have worked their way into the collective unconsciousness in \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\".  These two pieces have been imitated so heavily and fiercely that they sound familiar the first time you hear them, and both of them have a little something, quite undefinable (Reed claims in the case of \\"Sweet Jane\\" that it's the extra chord that quickly sweeps by in the progression, I think it's an unnerving amount of passion in the vocal presonally) that makes them perfect. <br /> <br />The rest of the album doesn't quite live up to them, but it's full of superb songs, from the Beatlesque \\"Who Loves the Sun\\" to the sarcastic \\"New Age\\" and \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" to the the explosive \\"Held Held High\\" and the churning \\"Train Round the Bend\\".  There are no real low points on the record, it's in fact all quite good.  Highly recommended.
1932100385|5.0|I have been interested in good health practices for a long time now. Through my own efforts I had already found that the only way to accomplish this was to become a Vegan. When I read The China Study I realized just why this is so. I have never found a book that I could give to another person and see his complete paradeim change. No amount of talking on my part could accomplish this as quickly or completely as this book. I have bought several and use them as loaners asking for the commitment that they will read it cover to cover and not skim or speed read it. Without exception, if a person will do this, he will make the necessary changes to his lifestyle and see immediate improvement in his health. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. It's a must read. Thank you being a supplier. Not all major book stores stock it and I'm sure it's because of lobbing pressures from major industry concerns. It rates along with the Bible in its field of improtance.
B000002G7E|3.0|Sophomore slumps are a common enough theme, and like many acts, the Velvet Underground had one.  Their slump is really a case of overreaching, not of a lack of good songs.  The band, removed from the influence of Andy Warhol and without the presence of Nico, produced a totally unfocused and random album that when it was good, it was genius, but when it wasn't, it was often good ideas gone wrong. <br /> <br />Perhaps the worst of the good ideas gone wrong is \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\".  A so-so song, it has this bizarre duo-vocal where John Cale starts lines and Lou Reed finishes them, but Lou sings louder and comes in late, so there's no consistency. <br /> <br />But there is quite a bit of good, the title track (\\"White Light/White Heat\\") is a smoking rock song, Lou catches fire on the vocal, and the piece pushes fantastically, and while it's often pointed out as unloved, I think the nearly 18 minute \\"Sister Ray\\" is nothing shrot of brilliant.  Featuring an extended jam in which the band tried to outvolume each other, it really is something to hear.  In fact, this is really what the best of the album is-- a relentless sonic attack. <br /> <br />It seems clear, listening in retrospect, that there was tension between Reed and Cale on the record (and to no surprise, Cale was fired from the band after the record), and the album suffers for it.  Still, if you loved \\"The Velvet Underground and Nico\\", check this one out, there's a lot to like here.  If you're new to the band, start with the debut (if you're a little weird) or \\"Loaded\\" (if you like straight rock and roll).
B00008H2LB|5.0|A very good album. I didnt know alot about Linkin Park since I started listening to the album \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\". I thought Linkin Park was horrible. But when I listened to it, damn. Was I wrong. Hybrid Theory and Meteora are my favourite albums ever. I listen to these albums almost everyday. And for the people that doesn't like Linkin Park, like you guys can do better than them.
B000002G7G|4.0|... still awfully good. <br /> <br />The Velvet Underground's third album (and curiously enough, they're second eponymous release) finds the band at a crossroads.  John Cale, whose avant-garde leanings introduced an element of tension to the band, was gone, replaced by a sweet voiced singer/bassist/pianist named Doug Yule.  Yule brought a rock 'n' roll sensibility that streamlined the muisc quite a bit.  It's still got its share of crunch and noise, but there's a wistful romanticism to this record. <br /> <br />In fact, its this sort of romanticism that is much of the best material-- delicate opener \\"Candy Says\\" (ably sung in an almost androgynous voice by Yule), stunning ballad \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" (proportedly about a woman with hazel eyes, but songwriter Lou Reed feared repercussions from her husband....), the unnervingly stunning ballad \\"Jesus\\", so beautiful it needs to be heard and the Maureen Tucker sung \\"After Hours\\", filled with a unique sweetness and innocence. <br /> <br />Mind you, Reed and company turn on the distortion in a couple great rock songs, like \\"What Goes On\\", \\"Some Kinda Love\\" (with the incomparabl line, \\"you're like a dirty French novel\\") and \\"Beginning to See the Light\\", but all in all, its a pretty quiet affair.  And while there's at least one spectacular misfire (multiple competing vocal disaster \\"The Murder Mystery\\"), all in all, its quite a good effort.  Recommended.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|This is one of the funniest Disney movies I have seen.  Excellent movie for an adult as well as a child.  Highly recommended.
B00092ZL80|4.0|I saw EWF live recently, and this DVD captures the essence of the concert for me to keep!  Great sound, well done. <br /> <br />Chicago didn't age as well as EWF, in my opinion, but it was good to hear Make Me Smile and the overture that followed again and see it performed.   <br /> <br />For someone that loved these two bands, as I did, this is the DVD to have.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|When I first was given this CD I wasn't very big into Perfect Circle or Indie Rock for that matter. The songs are completely amazing with fast and loud bass lines to the raspy vocals. I encourage anyone to buy this cd.

0312335164|5.0|Never put this book down. Dan Brown is a master of captivating readers minds with his books and DIGITAL FORTRESS is no exeption. If you put this book down you'll just want to pick it up again and read it. This book is bound to be the best Dan Brown has ever written.
B00003CWTI|4.0|I don't know if this is been mentioned previously, and I have no intention of reading through 680-odd reviews to find out. But the deal with the frogs is this: <br /> <br />They are of a class of events known as \\"Fortean phenomena\\", after Charles Fort, their first serious recorder. Fort was an eccentric newsman of the early 20th century who had a hobby of collecting accounts of bizarre and inexplicable events. A major component of these is falls of frogs, of which he compiled several hundred examples, along with falls of pollywogs, tadpoles, snakes, unknown species of insects, plants, rocks, 'manna', and blood. Fort published four books of these and related mysteries which are still in print and available on Amazon.  <br /> <br />One of these was titled \\"Wild Talents\\". If you noticed this book on Jeremy Blackman's desk during the \\"study hall\\" scene, you're very, very good.  <br /> <br />How this ties in with the film's theme of randomness and coincidence is too obvious to go into. But I hope this helps the many viewers who found the climax repellent or perplexing. <br /> <br />And while I'm at it -- great flick all around. It's a four-and-a-half, docked half a notch for using an insipid Three Dog Night song for the intro.
0743518136|2.0|I received \\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" as a used audio cassette tape, 2 hours in length.  The author's message is simple and endearing -- build on your strengths, avoid your weak areas.   <br /> <br />As other reviewers metion, much of this book focuses on a second message, \\"pay $20 to use our web tool to find out your strengths.\\"  Personally, I found the underlying message that you can't figure out your own strengths without their expensive assistance to be pretty annoying.  There was also a strongly stated message that you can't possibly fix your weak areas so don't even try.  Poppycock!  Don't believe this!  Also, the audio tape often mentions that the authors have compiled a list of 35 (34?) basic strengths, and never gets around to telling us what they are -- presumably, you have to pay the $20 for a new book and take the web survey to find out.  And, finally, the pace of the audio tape is really slow.  An hour & a half of \\"figure out your strengths and build on them\\" is about an hour more than was needed. <br /> <br />So, if you are interested, I suggest you buy it in book form, new not used.  People who were able to take the web test seem to have received more bang for their buck.
0930289528|5.0|I first read V for Vendetta as a serial in Warrior, a British anthology magazine. The first chapter I read was \\"Valerie\\" which is still one of the most incredible, heartbreaking, emotionally affecting pieces of fiction I've ever experienced in my life - in any medium. Naturally, of course, I then had to get all 26 issues of Warrior (which fortunately the store had), not realizing at the time it had been CANCELLED, like, the month before. The last chapter published was one of the biggest cliffhangers imaginable. It was that wonderful full page panel in which V says to Evey Hammond, \\"Welcome,\\" in case you were wondering. It was another three frickin' years before I got to read the rest of the story.    You're really missing something by not getting to see the original covers from Warrior that featured V for Vendetta. There was never a cover on that magazine that wasn't excellent, but some of the V for Vendetta stuff was particularly memorable. Picture a photo cover of a darkened alley. At the end of the alley, we see a human figure in silhouette, standing on top of a building, wearing V's distinctive cloak and Puritan hat, and the tagline, \\"Pray the Future Will Never Need V...for Vendetta!\\"    Ah, good stuff.    Warrior ceased publication in 1985. In 1988 DC Comics reunited Alan Moore (the writer responsible for the original stories on which the movies From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen were based) and artist David Lloyd to finish the series, which was published in 10 monthly issues, then collected in hardback and trade paperback. Be aware, by the way, that the original Warrior stories had the artwork printed in black and white, but the DC stuff has been \\"colorized\\" in pastels. I think Lloyd's art looked better in black and white, it had a very harsh chiariscuro effect that worked really well with the grim subject matter.    I've thought for years that V for Vendetta would make an extraordinary movie, but I question whether the intellects (hack! cough!) behind the last two Matrix movies can do it justice.
B000002I27|5.0|The second Doors album takes off where the first left off.Some of the songs on this album sound like they were left off of the first for some reason or another.That doesn't make them bad, they just didn't fit with the songs of the first. <br /> <br />Highlights would be Strange Days, the hit Love Me Two Times, and the other hit People Are Strange(my personal favorite).I also enjoy Horse Latitudes, but it was more Jim's poetry to some strange sounds than an actual song. <br /> <br />Moonlight Drive, My Eyes Have Seen You, and I Can't See Your Face In My Mind are good, but not great. Of the three My Eyes Have Seen You is probably my favorite. <br /> <br />You're Lost Little Girl and Unhappy Girl are my least favorite songs on this album, but Okay enough so that I don't skip them when listening to the cd. <br /> <br />When The Music's Over is an attempt to recreate the masterpiece known as The End, and while that goal was not achieved, it is an excellent song to finish off the second album by The Doors.
B00097A5HW|1.0|besides of the first single - which I love - the rest of the songs are too slow and boring! Save yourself some money and just download the single for 0.99 or so and not spend the money on this <br /> <br />best
B000002I25|5.0|The debut album of The Doors is I personally believe one of the greatest albums of all time.Jim Morrison, otherwise known as the Lizard King, was quite possibly one of the greatest rock n roll frontmen of all time. <br /> <br />Though all songs are excellent, the highlights would have to be Break On Through, Alabama Song, Light My Fire, and The End. Break On Through is an excellent rocker, Alabama Song is extremely catchy, Light My Fire features an amazing organ solo, and The End is as beatiful as it is contoversial. <br /> <br />As for the other songs, The Crystal Ship, is a nice a nice slower song.Twentieth Century Century Fox is also a good song, though not as good as Break On Through.I think Take It As It Comes is an icredibly good song, but was never really ever considered a hit.I have the same opinion for End Of The Night. <br /> <br />Soul Kitchen, Back Door Man, and I Looked At You are my least favorites, bot they are not in no way bad songs. <br /> <br />This first work from The Doors is a must have for any fan of rock music.  <br />

0375507256|4.0|Whilst not always an easy read, Cloud Atlas never fails to impress and approaches brilliance on many an occasion.  <br /> <br />The technique of separate (and yet curiously linked) sub-divided tales has certainly been done before (Iain Banks' Inversions springs to mind) and yet rarely with such lasting effect as this minor masterpiece.  <br /> <br />David Mitchell's inspired and varied use of language - from the colonial-era travelogue of Adam Ewing, to the post-apocalyptic adventures of Zachry in the Sloosha's Crossing tale (dialogue faintly reminiscent of the desert-dwelling feral kids in Mad Max 3) keeps the reader on their toes, with some glorious surprises along the way. Furthermore, Mitchell's use of often startling and always clever simile should satisfy the most picky literary critic  <br /> <br />Some reviewers have been critical (overly so in my opinion) of the sci-fi sections. I personally loved them - both the aforementioned Sloosha's Crossing and the profoundly moving Orison of Sonmi 451, in which the central theme of servitude is laid bare in most explicit detail. I defy anyone to read the final sentence from Sonmi 451 without a tear in their eye and a shiver down their spine.  <br /> <br />I must admit, however, to somewhat struggling through the Letters from Zedelghem and the Luisa Rey Mystery, neither of which contained scenarios that particularly fired my imagination. They do, nonetheless, along with the blackly comic and hugely enjoyable Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish, contribute their fair share to the overall and lasting effect of the book.  <br /> <br />Cloud Atlas is greater than the sum of its parts and contains at least something to satisfy demanding readers of many genres. Definitely recommended.  <br /> <br />
B000000W5F|4.0|Like many Xers, this is the album that introduced my generation to the music of the Stones. And as far as Stones albums go, this is an average outing. As far as the more recent albums go, this album ranks at the top of an average musical heap. That being said, there are some very solid tracks on here, even classics. Start me up is the obvious one, but it's the other gems like T&A, Tops, and Waiting on a Friend that keep this album alive as a whole. This is the album that probably marks the line of demarcation between the old and the new Stones sound. It was considered their comeback album after a long hiatus, and it didn't dissappoint the legions of fans and critics alike.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Titanic. Need I say more..? Ever since I saw this movie, I knew this groud breaking movie would be added to my DVD collection.. So, I was highly disappointed when the DVD was first released back in whenever it was. With no extra features or nothing.. However, I knew the special edition of Titanic had to come out someday. And it did! I am glad I waited for it.
B000002VMH|5.0|I raised myself on this album. It is beyond brilliance. It is also engrained in my mind with the equally brilliant film by Francis Ford Coppola, \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\". The two are inseparable companions of each other. The mood of the album goes perfectly with the film. Each song highlights a portion of the film. I don't expect anyone else to share in this or understand it. It's incredibly, deeply personal for me. This album is such a part of my psyche, and always will be. It's beyond being an album. It's part of my journey through life. (As \\"Dracula\\" is as a film.)
1401200923|5.0|Okay, if you want a great story about mid-career Batman, go out and buy Hush volumes 1 and 2 immediately. Do not hesitate. If you need further convincing (and I don't doubt you will) then read on.<br /><br />I first learned of the Hush story from friends on the web. Originally a 12 month story arch from the monthly Batman comic, one of DC's tentpole publications, this comic stands almost perfectly on it's own two feet as a graphic novel, which I can attest to since I don't buy monthly comics outside of the occasional trade paperback.<br /><br />First off, Jim Lee's art is amazing. He strikes that elusive blend of style and realism that I seek when looking for a good artist. He doesn't go over-the-top and come off looking impressionist like many artists who have handled Batman, and yet he doesn't slip into the borigness of straight-up reality. His anatomy is solid, his environments are believable, and his women are beautiful. I'm an aspiring artist, and Jim Lee is definately an inspiration. If nothing else, buy it because it's a book full of great Jim Lee Batman art.<br /><br />As for the story, I've got to hand it to Jeph Loeb. When I read volume 1 the story seemed to be mostly an excuse for Jim Lee to play around in the Batman world and draw lots of it's favorite characters. But when I read Volume 2, it was a completely new ballgame. Most recent Bat-stories have fallen into the trap of meeting and maintaining a status quo. Hush is one of those rare stories that doesn't just change the status quo, it destroys it. I won't spoil anything, but I'll tell you that it has some pretty big impact on the Batman mythos, and unlike many recent comics it manages to evolve the story in ways that some will condemn, but others like myself will praise.<br /><br />Basically, without spoiling too much, the story is about Batman at the top of his game, but someone is organizing his enemies and Batman ends up wrapped up in a waist-deep conspiracy against himself. The plot is chock full of huge twists and surprises that I'll admittedly didn't see coming. In between the juicy details are some good action scenes with alot of great action with famous Bat-villains, some great dialog and character developement for Bats himself. And if you like Catwoman, HUSH offers one of the best stories about Batman's relationship with her I've read, and I found it very touching. The whole thing is a genuine rollercoaster of intruguing plot twists and solid character developement, and I was surprised at how well it kept me guessing.<br /><br />Overally, HUSH is definately a quality Batman story. If you've already had your fill of \\"early years\\" Batman stories, buy yourself Hush volume 1 and 2. Jim Lee's gorgeouse art with Jeph Loeb's compelling narrative is a genuine home-run for DC, and I really hope they come back together in a few years to give us another one.ock full of huge twists and surprises that I'll admittedly didn't see coming.

B00006LLLN|5.0|Okay,  if you don't know AKUS,  what planet are you from?  This is country music for those of us who aren't crazy about the commercial drivel on the airways.  It's bluegrass repackaged for the mainstream.  I've been an AKUS fan since about '92--this album is probably going to be my favorite. <br /> <br />Live music is so much better. . .not everyone can pull it off on recordings.  Alison Krause and her really superb friends have put together a fine set of recordings.  The album is crisp,  the mix is excellent, the band is incredibly tight.  Better, I think, than their studio albums--it just has so much presence! <br /> <br />The only bad thing, is now I've gotta go see 'em in person and so far, they've managed to avoid the local venues.  AKUS I'll buy the beer if you come to Reno!
0385720920|4.0|Over-the-top? Sure. Profane? Absolutely. Filthy, sometimes to the point that even the most died-in-the-wool 21st century media child will sometimes feel a little sick? Well, you know it; after all this is Chuck Palahniuk. <br />Heavy on graphic sex and scatological introspection, \\"Choke\\" introduces a mysterious and perhaps-messianic sex addict with an insane mother and pathetic best friend. It's difficult to categorize the plot or overall framework in any meaningful or succinct way without destroying much of the appeal of the novel. But suffice it to say that Palahniuk does just about what his readers would expect, pounding the story out in alternating terse and sickly ornate licks, making the present-tense urgency work pretty well where, in the hands of many other scribes, it would have failed horribly. The problems? Well, as has been mentioned, the dialogue has problems. As is often a problem with Palahniuk, it is sometimes difficult to tell at what point the sex/blood/guts/death approaches meaningless sensationalism; in his eyes it is not enough for us to see the gassy, slickly purple entrails pouring out of the roadside corpse.

Better to indulge your nutso-sadism fantasies--not me, not me--in 'Choke' than in real life.

B000641Z90|5.0|I am crazy about Phil Collins and his music. In my humble opinion, this is the best DVD of him in concert he has ever made. I just wish there were a lot more of his concerts on DVD's. It is definitly worth the money. Phil Collins is a pure, certified, card carrying genius. I could watch this DVD all day long, over and over. If you like Phil Collins and his music, you have to buy this double DVD set.
1400032717|5.0|An outrageously hilarious murder-myster epic is set before us, surrounding the intelligent, working class no-hoper, John Boone!  But while adopting social standards, his thoughts and actions continue to be deemed rather eccentric.  Late one night, he encounters his neighbour`s poodle, Wellington, viciously pierced through the heart.  But Wellington`s garden owner has already witnessed Boone fumbling with the catatonic creature and, consequently, he finds hiself in remission.  Following his dreadful night in jail, he sets out on a mission to discover the culprit.  However, Boone`s social worker, Soiabhan, floods belief into his veins,  with the result of a hastily whipped-together diagram of notes and answers.  Equipped with such suspense, this is definatley a must-read novel, and I personally dub to be the book of the year.  You will enjoy, highly recommended!
B000929AJQ|4.0|Nine Inch Nails is Trent Reznor any fan can tell you this.  With this album you can feel Reznor's true self.  He said it would be the album that reflects him the best.  After the first listen I wanted to like it more, but like many albums that have certain expectations this album would be like Lateralus from Tool.  People place such a need on every song and every note to be the best ever.  People give it another spin in the player, and you shouldn't be disappointed. <br /> <br />The pain is still there and reflecting on everyday pain sells.  My favorite song has to be \\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same.\\" <br />From the begining, \\"I believe I can see the future <br />As I repeat the same routine I think I used to have a purpose.\\"  This can include anyone who has just seen themselves repeat mistakes they seem to fall into everyday.  Life becomes a routine with every emotion becoming emotion-less. <br /> <br />\\"The hand that feeds,\\" is a great political song expressing Trent's truth.  Check out the remix of this song.  I've found that the singles remixed versions being bettter than the original. <br /> <br />The Collector, Love is not Enough, Getting smaller, and the line begins to blur are all great songs. <br /> <br />\\"Beside you in time\\" could be an intro song.  It leads you in to a beat that makes you want to slam your hands against the steering wheel only to see the people in the next car give you looks like your a spaz.  <br /> <br />\\"Only\\" was the second single released and it was a song that took me a couple of times to begin to like.  It's becoming one of my favorites on the album, and I hope he makes some remixes to it.  <br /> <br />Great mixing of hard and soft as Trent does, may not be The Fragile, but it is what it is.

B000002UAF|5.0|This album is great. It's my personal favorite Beatles album. I love every song on it. The thing i love about this album is that the songs are a lot more catchy than some other beatles CDs. They are good here and you should definitely buy this album
B0000DJZA5|5.0|\\"Let It Be..Naked\\" offers a different musical perspective on one of the Beatles final projects. Initially in early 1969, following the experimentalism of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and the eclecticism of the self-titled \\"White Album\\", The Beatles set out to make an album of new material recorded completely live without any gimmicks or studio trickery. In the end, it didn't quite work out that way as the band temporarily shelved the project and recorded their final album, the masterful \\"Abbey Road\\".<br />When \\"Let It Be\\" was initially released in 1970, producer Phil Spector had remixed the original tapes by adding numerous overdubs, mainly orchestration. While Spector's job on the original release was flawless, it somewhat took away the raw live feel that the Beatles had originally intended the album to be.<br />With \\"Let It Be..Naked\\", we get to hear an approximation of what the album would've possibly sounded like had The Beatles initially released it as such. Most of the overdubs added to the original recordings have been removed revealing the raw nature of songs as they were originally performed and recorded. In some cases, alternate takes of certain tracks are used here. Classics such as \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"I Got A Feeling\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" are not only presented here in stripped-down form, they are completely different takes of what was used on the original album. Also, while \\"Let It Be's\\" title track is essentially the same, minus the orchestral overdubs, the guitar solo is completely different than the original single and album versions which had different guitar solos in each.<br />In addition, all of the tracks presented on \\"Naked\\" have been completely remixed and remastered and have a vibrant fresh sound. Initial copies of this album also come with a 22-minute bonus disc entitled \\"Fly on The Wall\\" which features rehearsals and studio chatter from the sessions that produced the \\"Let It Be\\" album. While the bonus disc isn't all that exciting, it still is fun to listen to and is an historic eavesdrop on some legendary sessions.<br />While nothing can ever take the place of the original \\"Let It Be\\", the \\"Naked\\" disc is still a great album and displays the music from another angle. \\"Let It Be\\" and its \\"Naked\\" counterpart are two different albums and should be treated as such. Regardless of what one may think, this music is excellent now matter how it's represented.<br />Still a Classic!!ing, it still is fun to listen to and is an historic eavesdrop on some legendary sessions.

0790732254|5.0|I believe that this is the only movie to ever be nominated in every single category at the Academy Awards. It was for good reason as well. It is, in a way, a perfect movie. It's an extrememly well done version of the play about a married couple who has an extremely vicious argument for the entirety of the film. All four credited actors in the movie receive Oscar nominations and for good reason. Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis all give fantastic performances. Taylor and Burton are the drunk, argumentative couple who were actually married at the time of the film. Taylor is the daughter of the president of a small college and Burton is a history teacher. Very late at night after a faculty party a couple has been invited over to their house by Taylor unbeknownst to Burton who would prefer to sleep. The husband is a young biology teacher at the college and the woman is his rich young wife. They are all extremely drunk and over the course of the party all of their very personal secrets come out quite embarrasingly in a series of elaborate and ridiculous games. It is a great film about human nature.

0765301598|5.0|The Legends of Dune trilogy is absolutely a great trilogy. I found it a little faster read than the original series, but this series still has its twists and provokes deep thinking as much as its founding series. The authors do an astounding job in showing the basis and beginnings of virtually everything in the original Dune series; from the founding of the Guild and the Sisterhood to the significance of the Atreides' hawk. This trilogy is a must read for any science fiction reader, and even more so for the Dune fan. I am not a big reader by any means, but this trilogy kept me turning pages. I am challenged to say that I enjoyed the Legends of Dune  trilogy more than the original books. <br />

B00006AUIG|3.0|...and rarely original and impressive as such, though I must add that the outcome of the plot was rather obvious -so therefor I felt a bit let down by the ending. It's more confusing than scary, though it is \\"build\\" as a horror-movie -and had the potential to be a great one too. It's a fantastic place (the building I mean, playing the biggest part of the story) haunted by memory, but it's psychological -not supernatural. Yes, it's the perfect location for a good thriller, but this is also where the movie fails; I expected more out of this place. Only one time in the movie I wanted to shout at a character \\"Run, you fool!\\" -and that was a negative surprise. All the spooky, dark and long corridors -all the stairs, the room of the institution where they once placed the dead bodies of the patients there, the patients returning there as one of the guards tell our \\"fellow\\" charcters at the beginning of the movie to scare them -to put it easy; I expected to be scared. I wasn't. This way this thriller did not live up to its' premises. And what a shame, it had such potential. The acting was good, but I expected some sort of paranoia taking over the way the movie built itself up. They should have \\"used\\" much more of what they had in this production, and I'm left with the question \\"Why?\\". The sound is in stereo, dolby digital or dts-surround is unavailable -and is sorely missed because of the sound that isn't very good. The picture on the other hand is very good. Good camera-work. On the plus side though, I repeat, I was absolutely entertained. It had my attention all the way. The ending was really tense, but as mentioned; Unsatisfying, and indeed predictable. You'll see for yourself.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Okay. this movie isn't for everyone.  This movie is for those of us, like myself, who like to laugh at the geekiness and nerdiness of others.  Yeah, you may think that sounds kinda cruel,  but that's how life is.  As speaking as one geek in high school, I can honestly say that i even laughed at this movie.  I think everyone who thinks back to their days in high school, or currently attending school can relate to this, because we've all known a few \\"Napoleon Dynamites\\" in our day.This is the movie that throws the geek lifestyle out there for our amusement.  No, it doesn't go for the lowbrow jokes, dirty jokes, or outrageous setups for jokes.  It's the actions of the geek characters that provides the laughter.  So if you're one of those who can watch a comedy and laugh at the absurdity of it's characters for amusement, then get this.  If you need lowbrow jokes, setup jokes, lame jokes, dirty jokes, cheesy jokes, go rent revenge of the nerds.  To the rest of us \\" I bet I can throw a football over them mountains!\\"
0385336810|4.0|What can I say, Sophie Kinsella was made to write beach books and this is no exception. I thought that maybe this was too similar to the Shopaholic books and I was ready for something different from her. Still, the book was light fun, perfect for a summer day when you want a fast fun read. Am going to try Undomestic Goddess and see if Kinsella breaks out of the Shopaholic mold.
B000002LND|4.0|Madonna's \\"Immaculate Collection\\" is indeed Immaculate. Nothing is left out (well, it came out in '90, so you won't find \\"Music\\" or any of her other more recent hits of course). The collection includes the huge pop, music-world changing hits \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"Vogue\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\", \\"Material Girl\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Like a Prayer\\". If you love Madonna, Pop music, and music of the 80's (who doesn't?) then you absolutely NEED this collection. Buy it and I promise you will listen to it religiously. It's just got some of the best pop hits of all time, and you'll never get sick of 'em!
B0000019PA|5.0|One of the most controversial albums of recent years, Jeff Mangum's IN THE AEROPLANE OVER THE SEA has a substantial number of fans proclaiming it a masterpiece, and a much smaller though still significant number of passionate detractors.  I belong to the former and have trouble understanding the latter.  When I listen to the album I hear nothing but one gorgeous song after another embellished by gorgeous arrangements and startling combinations of instruments or wonderful solo performances by Mangum that reminds me of an acoustic Billy Bragg.  Personally, I don't know anyone could resist a song that employs a fuzz guitar, bagpipes, accordion, and Theremin all at once.<br /><br />Though Ruston, Louisiana (home of former great NFL quarterback of Bert \\"The Ruston Rifle\\" Jones) will never be confused with Athens, Georgia, it is astonishing for the number of future rockers who originated there.  Not only Mangum but also core members of other Elephant 6 bands such as The Apples (in Stereo), Secret Square, and Olivia Tremor Control grew up together in Ruston, which is by any standard quite remarkable.  These and other bands have over the years engaged in remarkable cross-fertilization and collaboration, and as a group of bands and projects have exerted considerable influence on contemporary rock music.  Mangum has described his project Neutral Milk Hotel (were these words selected at random from a dictionary?) as fuzz folk, and I think that is an incredibly accurate description of the overall feel the band produces.  I'm pretty divided about whether I prefer the songs that Mangum performs on his own or on the ones where he invites friends to play along.  Because Neutral Milk Hotel is a project rather than a band, he has considerable latitude in selecting his collaborators on different songs.  While I absolutely love numbers like \\"The King of Carrot Flowers,\\" I find numbers like \\"Holland, 1945\\" with its full horn section amazingly stirring.  Luckily, there is no reason that I have to decide preferences on this issue.<br /><br />For my money there isn't a weak cut on the album, though some move me a bit more than others.  If I had to limit myself to only a few songs, I probably would name as my favorites \\"In the Aeroplane Over the Sea,\\" \\"Two-Headed Boy,\\" \\"Holland, 1945,\\" and \\"Ghost,\\" with its astonishing collection of exotic instruments in the rousing finish, though I am able to keep myself to my arbitrarily chosen four cuts by eliminating songs I like nearly as much, such as \\"Communist Daughter,\\" \\"Oh Comely,\\" and \\"The King of Carrot Flowers.\\"<br /><br />My one criticism with Mangum's album is that on a lyrical level it rarely makes sense.  Or, perhaps the lyrics do make sense in some alternative universe to which I do not have access, but are clearly not at home in this one.  The lyrics and images they conjure are often compelling, but they rarely make much sense.  Some people compare the elusiveness of his lyrics with Dylan from the mid-sixties, but I find this not quite right.  The brilliance at Dylan's lyrics was that while on one level they were somewhat opaque, they nevertheless hinted at meanings just below the surface of things so that you gained a newer understand of the normal of the everyday world as a result.  Dylan's lyrics might be difficult, but you always had the sense that there were great truths on a deep level.  Not so with Mangum.  One gets the sense that he is not providing an alternative description of a shared world, but articulating the quirkiness of his private one.  Now, I find the music so brilliant that this doesn't bother me too much, and I find that his bizarre lyrics provide wonderful texture to the music, but unlike Dylan Mangum doesn't help me understand anything.  So while I do not agree with those who bash Mangum's work as bad, I will acknowledge that those who find his lack of lyrical clarity frustrating are making a valid point.  The question for me is whether the many, many good things on this albumare outweighed by lyrics that to belong to a private language.  For me they are not, and I have trouble understanding how anyone can ignore the many brilliances on this truly original album.album are outweighed by lyrics that to belong to a private language.  For me they are not, and I have trouble understanding how anyone can ignore the many brilliances on this truly original album.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is not about Yoshimi battling pink robots.  It is a metaphorical meaning for life, from birth till death.  They capture everything so brillantly, especially pt. 2 of yoshimi battling the pink robots.  The battle, or struggle for life, is filled with ups and downs that run the gamet of emotions one is able to experience.   Back to the beginning of the album, one could surmise that the fight test is really birth, being born into the harsh world and giving it your best to make it.  Ones life can be followed all the way to the end, when Approaching Pavonis Mons by Ballon is interpreted by the end reaching heaven.  Its funky undertones and cloud like melodies reinforce the accomplishment of life by one achieving nirvana or reaching heaven through a life of whatever is required, they even put in trumpets to announce your arrival.
B0009X75RO|5.0|Wow kids, thanks for the trivia but what does that have to do with how wonderful the movie is!? <br />\\"Chicago\\" is a very well written musical by Fred Ebb, John Kander and Bob Fosse that is still playing on Broadway today in its revival incarnation. In 2002, Mirimax released the wonderful motion picture adaptation. Catherine Zeta-Jones sings and dances Velma Kelly just as well as previous Velma, Chita Rivera and ever better than Bebe Newirth. Richard Gere, although nasil, does a wonderful job as Billy Flynn. Renne Zellwegger plays Roxie nicely, like a Kewpie doll, only problem: if she'd open those eyes! <br />John C. Reily is great at Amos. I wish he were given more to do. But the real scene stealer is Queen Latifah as Marton Morton. She is a true musical performer who has great comic timing.  <br />Rob Marshall's direction and choreography is excellent. The editing is even better. Bill Condon's screenplay is brilliant. The two men have put together a brilliant spin on the great show. <br />\\"Chicago\\", like previous reviewers have said, won 6 Oscars including Best Picture. A film this good and this sucessful (most finanically sucessful of all Mirimax films) deserved a two disc set. When it was released on DVD in 2003, I for one was shocked. It got a single page chapter guide and one flimsy disc with the movie, the cut song \\"Class\\", an audio commentary and a commerical of a \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" look.  <br />Now, we finally get a THREE disc \\"Chicago\\" set. Hopefully it will include some info on the wonderful, if ignored, Bob Fosse directed 1975 production and some information on some of the breifly mentioned in the commentary ideas for the cut songs \\"Me and My Baby\\" and \\"My Own Best Friend.\\"  <br />I'm really looking foward to this great DVD transfer of this great film!
0201721481|4.0|C++ Primer - Fourth Edition has a really effective way of teaching you the C++ programming language-full detail of what every bit of code does. Have you ever looked at C++ code and had no idea what all of it meant? This book will teach you every single bit of what that code does.<br />The book is laid out in approximately 17 different chapters which are then divided into an average of 9-15 sections. Each chapter is focused on one key subject such as the begining steps and more advanced techniques to use your code. Within those chapters you have each section slowly explaining in detail what each bit of code you're seeing is doing.<br />Now as I've said before, this book explains every bit of code in detail, but this doesn't mean that this book isn't for just beginners. The books cover states that over 48,000 programmers have learned the coding language from beginners to more advanced.<br />About every other page contains tips and secrets to successful coding which stand out in gray boxes. Some of the most smallest things are mentioned here such as how comments work in your code to how your code should be formatted. These tips will help you inprove your coding habits very much.<br />Now you're probably thinking, \\"This is just another one of those reviews which show each good part of the book. It's not like they're going to give me any info on weak parts of the book!\\", Well in fact you're wrong. This book isn't all positive. There's some parts in this book which can be very annoying such as lacking a glossary of needed terms even though most terms are put in bold print. There are very good examples of code in this book, but not all of them are the most interesting. Reading this book can be very monotonous at times because of the lack of different things they mention you can code or give you examples of code.<br />How about the strong points? In depth explanations, great examples, great tips, need I say more? This book has a lot of good points to it, there are very fewweak points. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a good C++ reference manual.

B0002X314C|5.0|I was so glad that John Legend will not be a \\"one-hit\\" wonder after hearing this CD.  One of the few CDs that every song is worth playing again and again.

B00000HYXB|5.0|At first I didn't really understand why this album was receiving all the praise that it did, and thought it was just an over hyped Power Metal release. Boy was I wrong. This CD is like a fine red wine. Sure it will be decent right away, but after aging for a while, it can become something truly special. This album IS something truly special. The songs, the concepts, the amazing vocals; they all work in harmony to create one of the best PM releases of all time. <br /> <br />Let's start with the concept. The album follows Tolkien's \\"The Silmarillian,\\" interspersing dialogue tracks between the majestic songs to keep the listener informed on what is going on in the story. With Power Metal being so focused on fantasy and imagination for the most part, Tolkien was a great choice to do a concept album of. His works epitomize fantasy and imagination for the most part. He's basically a PM bands wet dream. Blind Guardian brings the story to life in this release, accomplishing the feat better than any other PM band could have possibly done. There is so much detail put into this release in terms of the finer details of \\"The Silmarillian.\\" I won't pretend to know much about Tolkien, but another review I was reading on this site explained so many smaller, minute details that this album has acknowledged. I really respect BG for that, as they really wanted to stay as close to the story as possible. <br /> <br />Hansi is an incredible vocalist, and his range and tone seem effortlessly controlled through the whole album. Every song is unique and amazing, and there is not an ounce of filler to be found. Of course you have your basic PM double kicks and guitar shredding, but it's done in such a way that it seems fresh and invigorating. The vocals seem to feed off the drums, and the drums seem to feed off the vocals. The same can be said about the guitar and the bass, it's just one amazing, cohesive, unit. This is as close to \\"perfection\\" as anyone could hope to achieve.  <br /> <br />Idon't really have one favorite track, as I listen to this as one big story. I am so glad I purchased this album, and it's really in the elite group with my other favorites. Albums like this don't come around every day, so get it now! You won't be disappointed.
B00009L1TA|2.0|So the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks. It really does. I'm not sure who their military consultant was, but if Samuel L. has Specialist pins on his collars, you don't call him Sargeant. Women aren't allowed in the Rangers (Nunez), not my rules ladies, Colonel Styles looks a little young to be a colonel (even for the Army), the Army doesn't issue tiger stripe BDU's (Mueller), the list goes on and on. This may not seem that important, but if you're gonna make a movie about the Army, you could at least get some very BASIC (soory, could't resist) things correct.  <br /> <br /> <br />  Yes, it's true that there are many twists and turns in this 'plot', but all that really means, at least in this case, is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay. Hey, if we tell the same story a couple different ways, it makes the story really interesting, right? Not so much. Oh, and that scene where \\"Specialist\\" West is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape? Wow, who decided that was a good idea? I don't want to ruin the ending for you, because there's no point in even seeing this movie, and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the 'finale' long before it makes its belated arrival. By the way, how do you follow someone in an Army Humvee w/out them knowing? Seriously. Please spend these 90 or minutes talking with your kid's, reading a book, excercising, writing a review... I dunno, something worthy of your precious time. You've been warned. <br /> <br />By the way, Connie Nielsen looks hot w/ short red hair.

As soon as I began leafing through this little book I recognized every single thing I read on every page... because I already read it.<br /><br />Someone took the original \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" & re-typed it with only 1-2 sentences per page.<br /><br />Talk about stretching content to make a sale.
B000063JDE|5.0|Simply put, one of the best films to come out of the 80's. Unique, dark and edgy. Even those who don't &quot;get it&quot; have to admit that they've never seen anything quite like it. One of the most original opening sequences in movie history. Thankfully this version of the DVD includes an insightful hour long documentary. The film is so good I bought it 3 times.
0790731479|5.0|Here's the plot of 1988's \\"Beetlejuice\\", significantly simplified:<br /><br />A young couple who've recently died find that another family is moving into their house. They must haunt their home and drive the family away, but find it nearly impossible to do. So, new to the afterlife and oblivious to the danger involved, they seek assistance from the kooky bio-exorcist Beetlejuice to help them freak the new family out. But the spirit realm's menace of a ghost has some choatic plans of his own.<br /><br />As for some of the cast and crew:<br /><br />Tim Burton as a director has almost always succeeded in delivering spectacular films, and this is no exception. His strange visual style is mesmerizing as usual. Danny Elfman's theme (as well as the rest of the score) is brilliant. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin were obviously great choices as the recently deceased couple. Catherine O'Hara and Jefferey Jones fit quite well as the parents of the invading family, with their goth-daughter played by the heavenly Winona Ryder. And, last but not least, the character of Beetlejuice is portrayed perfectly by Michael Keaton.<br /><br />And for my personal opinion:<br /><br />Keaton stole the show, no doubt about it. I think the main reason anyone should see this is for the whacky charismatic character of Beetlejuice. From some of the best one-liners you'll ever hear, to the nutty antics he applies to practically everything he does, he's one of the greatest characters ever to grace the screen. Superbly supported by an extensive cast and crew that knew what they were doing and everything that was needed for a classic comedy of twisted themes, there is no denying the power of such a film. This is a must-see for sure (and for most, a must-own).
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Faith No More is and always will be light years ahead of System of a Down. To say that System of a Down is a reincarnation of Faith No More is an extreme insult. SOAD can only hope to be as godly as Faith No More which will never happen, unless somehow they fire Serj and hire Mike Patton. Just thought I'd let you all know! ^_^ I'll probably get a lot of \\"Not Helpful\\" ratings, but whatever, it just goes to show how many MTV slaves are out there.
630516889X|5.0|Sent on a rescue mission into the jungles of South America, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his group of commandos encounter another visitor among the trees -- and it's not human. The vicious hunter from space slaughters the group one by one, eventually having Arnie as the last living human in the vast jungle of death. But to the creature's surprise, this particular man is going to be much more difficult to destroy!<br /><br />Predator is as much of an action film as it is a sci-fi film. Before the extraterrstrial is fully introduced, there are a few military shoot-em-up scenes to satify any action-film fan. Then, without warning, one of history's greatest movie-monsters rips it's way into the plot. The story is very well paced, and the superb acting, editing, cinematography, and score push it even further. Regardless, the greatest aspect of the film is undeniably the predator itself. Neat gadgets (including numerous weapons and a cloaking device) show the surprising intelligence of the creature. The pure savagery and barbaric appeal it has really puts fear in the viewer! It's facial features are indeed terrifying, the body-suit and costume used are extremely realistic, and in the simplest of terms, the predator is the coolest monster ever to appear on screen. This is a masterpiece in every way. Predator is a must-see for any action fan, monster fan, and even horror fan. An untouchable classic!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay. Their first cd propelled me into the (then unknown for me) world of Brit rock and opened the window to bands I had (sadly) never listened to: Travis, Radiohead, and U2 amongst others. The only problem was I ended up liking the other artists in Britrockland better than Coldplay. It wasn't that their music was bad. I mean, I liked it. But it became more of an adjective for a genre-\\"Oh, yeah, I like the Coldplay sound\\"-and failed to win any kind of true devotion on my part. This, of course, is tragic in light of their latest album. Some say it was Gywneth. Some say it was time and maturity and growth and finding themselves. Whatever it was, something happened between Album 2 and Album 3 for Coldplay. And that something is amazing. X&Y is quiet and loud and passionate and truthful. It calls us to believe and to trust and to listen. There is a calmness in the lyrics and an insistence in the melodies. In a time of war and craziness around the world, Coldplay has created an album that quietly speaks to that deep human need to be cared for and loved. It's as if they are saying, \\"It's okay. Come home. Just take a listen and close your eyes. I can't give you all the answers but I'll be here for you anyway.\\"
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I for one actually quite enjoyed this movie. I agree that you are going to either like or hate this type of movie full of CGI the old worn out good versus evil plot and an actor in Reeves who is hated as much as he is admired. I for one am in the first group and think he does very interesting movies that suit his acting style and the characters he likes to play. Constatine is loosely based on a poupular comic book about a man with a special gift who is trying to redeem himself in order to get into heaven. Along the way he meets a detective who badly wants to avenge her twin sisters death and they work together batteling evil with allot of interesting characters on the side. I think critics of this movie took it too seriously. Purists think it ripped the comic book off when in fact it makes me interested in tracking it down. Second the Heaven versus Hell plot while done a million times is done well here with a few viewpoints I can actually find intriguing. The special effects are excellent and the pacing of the movie was good as it wasn't too short like some of Fox's horrendous adaptations of comics like Daredevil(which got saved by a GREAT director's cut) and Elektra. I enjoyed this movie even if the subject matter is a little tiresome to some I found it to be fun. Shine on!
B000002G0P|5.0|Examine the above statement.  Read it again.  Again. <br />Yes, I believe \\"Extreme - III Sides to Every Story\\" is that good . . . <br />First, I heard the album 12 or 13 years ago.  My friend bought the album and it completely blew us away (even as high-school age kids).  But I recently purchased the album from Amazon as a tester, of sorts, to see if it's as good as I remembered, or if I needed to remind myself more often how much of a dork I was in high school.  Needless to say, there was no reason to chide myself. <br />Nuno, Gary, Paul and Pat are in top form here -- the lyrics are surprisingly relevant after all this time (Re: \\"Warheads,\\" \\"Rest In Peace,\\" and Politicalamity\\"), the phat sounds of the guitar and bass are kicked in the rear by Paul's perfect playing, and Gary drives the whole thing home with his stern blend of rock vocalizations and smooth, flowing harmonies (in the style of \\"More Than Words\\") both with himself and Nuno. <br />Surprisingly, the messages here are upbeat for any generation or genre, for that matter. <br />It's pure ear candy for this rock fan to zone out and into this fantastic, great album.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I loved this movie to death, but once again the studios are trying to screw you. Robert Rodriguez has OFTEN spoke at OFFICIAL press conferences saying that a 3-Disc DVD will be available this year, with 30 minutes to each vignette. This will be the BARE-BONES, STUDIO RELEASE. So, think you can wait a few months?
6304696515|5.0|I love period dramas, and this movie is one of my favorites.  The costumes, as well as the locations where they shot this film are very accurate and well done.  The cast is exceptional, and the script is very well written. <br /> <br />Some of the scenes, with their rich dialog, blow me away, especially the scenes between Valmont (John Malkovich) and the Marquis (Glen Close). The characters in this movie are deep, complicated human beings.  John Malkovich and Glen Close give an outstanding performance. <br /> <br />My two favorite parts in this movie are the opening scene and the final scene.  In the opening scene, the Marquise de Merteuil (Glen Close) brushes her hair in the mirror and smiles to herself, as she sees her reflection.  The final scene is of the Marquise taking off her makeup and looking at her reflection in same mirror.  This time there are tears running down her face.  The Marquis tells Valmont that her desire is to \\"win or die,\\" as she seaks personal revenge over a society that gave her no freedom as a woman in upper class 18th century France. If the opening scene is of the Marquis \\"winning\\", we can guess what this final scene is about.   <br /> <br />This is a dramatic movie.  However, this film concludes with a brillent scene which quietly and tragically ends the story.  This final scene is subtle, and creates pity for a character who has been a villain through out the film.    <br />
B000005Z0E|4.0|First off, people who diss this album are completely RETARDED for comparing this album to his later coming albums. Of course his later cd's are gonna be better than his first jackass. It's like comparing a plastation with a PS2. It just doesn't work!!! This is a kickass album from a kickass rapper. 2Pac will always live on.
0062502182|5.0|We are not an era that readily accepts fables anymore.  On the surface, The Alchemist appears like a children's story.   But, we would be missing a great deal if we understand this book only from its surface value.  This story reads like a myth.  It is seeped in symbols that offer lessons on living. It speaks about the experience we all undergo as human beings.  This novel is not as much about the quest of the main character, it is about his journey along the way.       I loved \\"Power of Myth\\" series on PBS done in the late 80's, where Bill Moyers interviews Joseph Campbell, the late American writer who wrote about mythology and comparative religion.  In the Power of Myth series, Joseph Campbell said, \\"Myth helps you to put your mind in touch with this experience of being alive. Myth tells you what the experience is.\\"  I think that is why \\"The Alchemist\\" appealed to me.      The boy's journey is a metaphor for how each of us travels through life.  When you finish the story, you ask yourself what is the most important thing after all?  Is it what the boy is searching for?  Or is it his journey along the way?    Look beyond the seemingly light hearted story and you will find a very deep meaning that can appeal to everyone.
0385338686|5.0|I'm not even a Sophie Kinsella fan but I absolutely loved this book.  My sister is a fan and I've read her copies of the shopoholic series and \\"can you keep a secret?\\" so I was a little curious when I saw this at the bookstore.  The inside back cover made me laugh out loud.  (as a fellow attorney, I've tried hiding my Blackberry from my doctor during an examination.) <br />The thoughts that run through Samantha's head are completely hilarious--as I read through the book, I kept laughing out loud--more than once per chapter. And even though I had an early morning meeting the next day, I stayed up until 2AM to finish the book.   <br />This is by far the best written work by Kinsella that I've read.  I highly recommend it as a fast read and great entertainment.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Just 1 year after the release of his classic debut, Eminem goes back to the lab and comes out with yet another one.  This time around though, Eminem shows a totally different side to him.  It's a dark, grimey, raw image he tries to portray on this album.  This album will fall under being one of the most controversial albums ever.  This album had people/parents protesting against it saying it shouldn't even be on the shelves.  Well all this eventually led to a record breaking 1.76 million copies sold in its first week, the most ever for a solo artist. <br /> <br />Eminem is on point on every single track off this album.  There is not 1 skippable track you will find on here.  This album is pure genius and classic.  Unlike the other Eminem albums, this one does not have any pointless and stupid skits.  My favorite is the Ken Kaniff one where he is making fun of the Insane Clown Posse.  His creativity is still there from his last album but the smooth flow and crazy lyrical ability is missing.  It's still hot but it just doesn't measure up lyrically to 'The Slim Shady LP.'  But on the other hand, the choruses are way better on this album compared 'The Slim Shady LP.'  The production is yet again really good, with Dr. Dre doing most of the tracks again.  I loved all the guest appearances on the album except for RBX who featured on \\"Remember Me?\\"  Guest appearances include D12, Sticky Fingaz, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Nate Dogg.  My favorite tracks are \\"Stan,\\" \\"The Way I Am\\" and \\"Criminal.\\" <br /> <br />There is almost nothing Eminem could of done to make this album better.  I would suggest this album to every rap fan...but don't let your parents here it or they might take it away from you and break it.  This album is straight up crazy and Eminem will surprise you with some of the stuff he says.  This album is definitely worth your money so go out and buy it.  I guarantee that you won't be disappointed with it.
B00068NVI4|5.0|To you people with the negative reviews, you're IDIOTS. Yes is the best concert I've ever seen and I've seen hundreds of concerts. I've been to see Yes well over 20 times and this was the best tour yet. I went to see it 2 times. And this is the best music DVD I've ever seen and heard. So quit your pettiness and sit back and enjoy. <br />-James F. Selah
2266144340|5.0|This book opened my eyes to a lot of things. This is a real good book. It made me think. Another book I have read lately that made me think is The Circle of Death by author Robert Rohloff of Canada.<br />I would like to recommend Da Vinci Code to be read carefully with an open mind.
B000002HMH|3.0|June 4, 1996...After growing up listening religiously to the Metallica of old as so many others, I purchased LOAD the day it was released with great expectations.  To say the least, at first play I was devistated.   I kept checking the cd to make sure I bought the correct disk.  I felt the sickness in the pit of my stomach as if my best friend and mentor had passed away.  I knew from that point on the Metallica I had grown to know and love was no more. The disk was put away.  <br /> <br />Fast forward nine years.... <br /> <br />I have way too many cds and I have challenged myself to give the \\"least favorite\\" disks a re-try or post them on e-bay.  I would like to think I have grown and matured and an individual and artist throughout the last nine years, so I thought I would give LOAD a replay.  I was very nervous about re-living the nightmare that was LOAD, but again, I'm an adult now and I thought I could face this monster with an open mind :) <br /> <br />At second play (it seems the wounds have healed) LOAD is not as bad as I had remembered so many years ago.  There are some high points,  <br /> <br />1. Ain't My Bitch <br />3. House Jack Built <br />4. Until It Sleeps <br />5. King Nothing <br />6. Hero of the Day <br />7. Bleeding Me <br />8. Cure <br />11. Mama Said *love the steel guitar* <br />12. Thorn Within <br />14. Outlaw Torn  <br /> <br />on this cd as well as some very, very LOW points  <br /> <br />2. 2 X 4 <br />9. Poor Twisted Me <br />10. Wasting My Hate <br />13. Ronnie <br /> <br />I feel this disk would've retained the most intergrity and been at it's best at 10 songs in length. <br /> <br />LOAD is definetly not the Metallica of old, but that's what artists do...they evolve (at least the goods ones do).  Even though this evolution was not in line with the ideas of the \\"die hard\\" Metallica fans (of whom I am a part of), we have no right to discredit Metallica as artists and individuals.  We are not the ones playing these instruments and writing this music therefore we have no input whatsoever in the final product.  All we can do is appreciate that product once it is delivered, or simply, DO NOT BUY AND DO NOT LISTEN.  That, my friends, is the only choice we have the liberty of making.  <br /> <br />Metallica plays not to please us, but to please themselves.  The choice is yours.
B00005JNTX|5.0|This is a strange case: the movie is not based in the comic... IT IS THE COMIC. Here, in Mexico, Grupo Editorial Vid published the series almost 5 years ago and every comic-reader was shocked. Even now, I have a friend who hates comic-books and still, she falled in love with this one. That says a lot about the movie so for me, it's the best \\"comic-movie\\". I know it's full of violence but in the end, the movie is about love and frienship. How bad could it be that? Please, check it out and try to watch it with your mind open. Maybe you'll fin a big surprise.
B000002KHH|5.0|For most fans this is the defining moment in Black Sabbath's career. Sure, it's probably the simplist music that they created, but each song has enough riffs and time changes to keep one interested forever. Most every hard rock and metal fan has heard at least three songs off this album, those being War Pigs, Paranoid, and of course Iron Man which is a song that EVERYBODY has heard. But, that doesn't mean that these are the only good songs on the album, as all the songs here are great. Every member here is in great form. Geezer Butler and Bill Ward proving once and for all that they are the greatest rhythm section ever. Tony Iommi, the master of the riff, would inspire a whole new generation of guitarists. And of course, Ozzy is Ozzy. <br /> <br />I believe that if Sabbath had only made this one album, they would still have gone down in history as inventing heavy metal and songs off Paranoid would still be played everywhere. So, if you are looking to start building your Sabbath collection or are just interested in finding out if this album lives up to it's reputation, buy it now, I assure you that you won't be disappointed. It is truly a great album and these songs will be stuck in your head forever!
B000056K04|5.0|But is that new sound a good one. This was my first DMB album, maybe that helps my admiration for it, but I may have liked it anyway, with great songs such as I Did It, Everyday, and Dreams of Our Fathers, helping this album with this new sound. this was one of the bands most succesful albums (sales wise) but many didn't like it, a reason why is Dave went elecric this album( which I personally liked) the one problem I have is producer Glen Ballard, making every song on here too short (no 7 minute jams here unlike on the bands best album Before These Crowded Streets.) instead it's 4 minute fast paced tunes. but still it's a reat album from possibly the best band certainly of modern time, and maybe even all time. <br /> <br />1. *I Did It 5/5 <br />2. When The World Ends 5/5 <br />3. The Space Between 5/5 <br />4. *Dreams of Our Fathers 5/5 <br />5. So Right 4.5/5 <br />6. *If I Had it All 5/5 <br />7. What You Are 5/5 <br />8.

Mother, Father 5/5 <br />12. *Everyday 5/5 <br /> <br />*= Reccommended Track <br />1= Aweful 2= Poor 3= Decent 4= Good 5= Great
B0002OERI0|4.0|i really enjoy this album. i find that it changes based on my mood - if i am in a good mood, it is very funny and fun to listen to. Other times it seems to capture perfectly the feelings of sort of helpless rage and necessary rebellion that make up the worst of being a suburban teenager in a bland suburban town full of malls and apathetic ditzes who love to shop, but it also mocks it and is very, very funny. i like how the somgs flow into each other, and jump around within a song, and really seem to tell a story. the music is catchy, loud, fast, and confident in a way that i find very appealing. i think that it is defineatly an album worth buying
B000002MP2|5.0|I dont care what this music is, wheter it be pop punk, punk rock, hard rock or whatever. Its really fun. Its ironic I think its the first song on the cd billie joe (lead singer) is singing about how he's not growing up and how he doesnt want to, but come the time of the album \\"warning\\" they had reahced full fledged maturity. There are some serious songs: <br />When I come around <br />There are some fun to listen to songs that make you feel, just..good i guess: <br />Basket case <br />Chump <br />She (at least I think so) <br />There are some songs everyone can relate to: <br />Longview <br />Having a Blast <br />Burnout (if your getting older) <br />And some...lets say strange songs: <br />F.O.D. (stands for \\"Fu*k off and Die) <br />All by myself (secret song about masturbation) <br /> <br />And everything else is great to. You dont have to like this album, and you dont have to dislike it, I just like it. <br />
0140067477|1.0|The Tao of Pooh is, I believe, an attempt at presenting the philosophy of Taoism in an entertaining and cute way using the familiar, and entertaining-in-themselves, characters of Winnie the Pooh.  However, I think that if you would like to learn about Taoism, you'd be better off reading a blurb off of a website. As for using the Winnie the Pooh characters to emphasize, illustrate and entertain, well, it just didn't work. In Hoff's \\"take\\" on Taoism, he tactlessly insults and irritates the average person living in Western Civilization who has any goals or aspirations in life.  There are some very nice beliefs in Taoism, such as the development of divine virtues (which is not, of course, unique to Taoism but is shared by almost all religions), such as compassion and caring. However, being an ancient philosophy, many of the concepts and ideas have outdated themselves for today's society. Even so, it is difficult to fully appreciate the peacefulness and simplicity of this philosophy with so many jabs thrown by Hoff along the way.  Poor Pooh!

0805028846|3.0|This book contains great lessons for the basics of pop-ups.  However, if you're looking for more challenging projects, this book is not for you.  The book has professional examples for each type of tecnique, but fails to show how to make any of them.  The gallery at the end of the book is very nice, but not if you want to make any of these designs, the patterns are not included.  I was also very disappointed in the lack of more skillful projects.  The whole design section with 38 different ways to make a heart card was not very useful.  I'd rather be able to make one of the gallery cards than make any of the heart ones.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles were extremely famous, and there's a big variety of Beatles albums available.  Why get this one?  Well, I like it because it has their biggest hits.  Those who like their biggest hits best will get all of them, and nothing but them.<br /><br />More than that, I found it impressive that in a mere eight years, the Beatles produced so many different kinds of songs.  This album is great at displaying the variety and imagination in the work of this superb foursome.
B000050XEI|4.0|Enya - A Day Without Rain (2000)<br /><br />Just kidding!!! Yes, this sounds like the same old Enya, but that's a good thing in this case. As a fellow reviewer on this forum put it (\\"Beethoven Nikita Christ\\" from Singapore), \\"Her sense of personal style is so strong that you can hear the music and say, \\"Ah . . . That's Enya, right?\\" even though you have never heard the piece before!\\"<br /><br />The album is uniformly beautiful and the songwriting is first-rate. I wouldn't say A DAY WITHOUT RAIN is as thoroughly outstanding as, say, SHEPHERD MOONS, though. Clearly there are stand-out tracks here (from a more pop perspective at least) like \\"Wild Child\\" and \\"Lazy Days.\\" I like the best songs from THE MEMORY OF TREES  better than this album although TREES has a few less than stellar tracks as well. Thus I give A DAY WITHOUT RAIN 4 stars, which I'd say is what it deserves compared to my still favorite (I'll admit it) SHEPHERD MOONS. But of course, this is a 5-star album compared to a lot of the schlocky, synthetic dreck out there, labels that have been unfairly leveled at Enya. Whatever synthetic technology Enya makes use of does not hinder the fact that this is soothing, stately and gorgeous music. Peace.
B00005JNSK|4.0|i dislike many tim burton films. i feel they are too \\"nice\\", too inocent, and they deliver a lesson at the end. with charlie, he is repeating all of these. but this one is nicer. when you read the book (im a fan, by the way, of roald dahl) you can fantasize a lot, but, really, what kind of person builds a factory and recludes in it? then, who can send golden tickets and have a show inside, with singing oompa loompas and huge sets? not dahl`s wonka. he is too inocent.  <br />burton succedes creating a great wonka. you believe him, not say \\"wow! willy is inhuman and well never reach him\\". burton creates a human. and all this trip to win approval of these children, because he cant get it from his dad, its awesome. <br />but, and heres the great but of the film, its a familiar film. when the last oompa says \\"and wonka won a family, and learned how important it is\\" you feel watching one of those silly disney films. and also i didnt believe christopher lee. i know everything its exaggerated, but big wonka its too fake and too shallow.  <br />anyway, it could have been a lot, lot better. but its great how it is. amusing, amazing, entertaining. if it only was a bit less silly...
B000001F9E|5.0|First of I would like to say I love Jimi, Page, Clapton and Beck, they are my heroes, they are my guiding lights in this world...but where do you go when you got all the Zeppelin cds, and youve experienced Hendrix thoroughly? That's exactly the question I was asking myself as I stumbled across Thin Lizzys Jailbreak...and that question was answered.<br /><br />As you can see other people have discovered Thin Lizzy as I have recently, and I am compelled to write a review about them. As a guitarist I noticed the dueling Les Pauls wielded by Gorham and Robertson, and I knew they meant business. These two guys make their guitars soar with high octane riffs, delicate harmony lines and orgasmic solos. Lynott as others have mentioned has a poetic touch and a way of phrasing his lyrics that is pleasing to the ear. I bought this cd being only vaguely familiar with the song Boys Are Back In Town, but my mommy had gotten me a Guitar One magazine that showcased the 200 Greatest Guitar Recordings Of All Time. Thin Lizzys Jailbreak was 18 out of 40 in the Classic Rock Section witch sparked my interest and made me buy this gem. All you classic rockers out there heed my call and buy this cd now and thank me later. Jailbreak is a great addition to any collection, and a great Lizzy album to start on.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Terrible action/horror movie that puts on a lot of hot air but lacks a lot of brains and substance to pull off the story its trying to tell.  Keanu Reeves was just the wrong man for the job and his performance is that bad. You just want to smash his faces of the people who though that he was right for this kind of role. You just don't take him seriously and you end up laughing at him more than being intrigue by his character. His co-star Rachel Weisz not only has a more interesting character than he does but is 100 times more the actor he could ever hope to be. She not only gives the film's best performance (a performance that has more life and complexity than the film itself) but is the films only redeeming quality. You actually want to spend more time with her character and pick her brain on the life she have lived and the sister she has forgotten instead of the mindless dribble that the film because after the second act. Her story would have made a much better and scarier horror movie but of course this is a Keanu Reeves movie, and we have to suffer with a script and a director who will cater to his limited needs as an actor. The director has some talent with visuals but he has no idea on how to put a actual film together and the screenplay is so unfocused that you really have no idea on what is going on from time to time. <br /> <br />Worth a look for Weisz's efforts but don't hold out hope for a film as good as she was. <br />
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Here's something I learned after watching this movie: <br /> <br />During Ellen Burstyn's impassioned monologue about how it feels to be old, cinematographer Matthew Libatique accidentally let the camera drift off-target. When director Darren Aronofsky called \\"cut\\" and confronted him about it, he realized the reason Libatique had let the camera drift was because he had been crying during the take and fogged up the camera's eyepiece. This was the take used in the final print. <br /> <br />There's nothing I can say about this film that hasn't been said.     It's absolutely heart-wrenching, see it.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I still like the first Harry Potter better than the second and the third.  In this 3rd DVD, it's good that the story has some twists and turns.  I kept asking myself, \\"How in the world did Hermione appear in the classroom when she wasn't there a second ago?\\" But in the end of the story everything is cleared up (as most of the stories are cleared up).  Funny how there's a magical continuity from 1, 2, & 3 when at the end of each story, the mystery/problem is always solved.  There's no, \\"That's the end?\\" kind of reaction.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I expected this movie to be a laugh-a-minute, scathing up-to-date political bash with undertones I could relate to.  However, it was nothing like South Park.  I loved the idea, however, of making a Marionette movie wiht plenty of explosions and setting things set on fire, but the movie just left me unmoved.  It was flat, forced, and not at all funny.  I was expecting Trey and Stone to take the low road for most of the movie, but I was expecting some cerebral humor.  It just doesn't live up to South Park.

B00097DX3U|5.0|I think this is probably one of the best albums you'll hear this year. Mind you Soundgarden and Rage kicks. <br /> But they have mutated into something much more powerful. <br />Not too rappy, not too heavy, just nice rockin' kick @ss material that gets better with every song and every listen. <br /> Chris Cornell has just the right rasp in his voice, and the guitar solo's are just plain different, which gives it a unique twist. The bottom end speaks for itself. <br /> I highly recommend this offering, <br /> PARTY ON GARTH.
B000002U8G|5.0|I Saw this at A&B Sound today for $8.99. It was a great choice! My Grandpa had it and I heard the album when I was 5. I thought it was weird, but now, I bought it and I loved it! Here is a review of the songs:<br /><br />1. One Of These Days: (100/10) The best on the album. It begins with wind howling, a creepy bass interlude, then an ear-splitting midsection with snippets from \\"Dr. Who\\". Then, once you hear Nick Mason's \\"One Of These Days, I'll cut you up into little peices!\\" All hell breaks loose.<br /><br />2. A Pillow Of Winds: (7/10) It's good, but there's better.<br /><br />3. Fearless: (8/10) One of the better songs. It's a Liverpool fight song.<br /><br />4. San Topez: (10/10) Great, I like the Hawaiian guitar.<br /><br />5. Seamus: (1.5/10) ???????????<br /><br />6. Echoes: (10/10) FANTASTIC! IT's 23 minutes of pure pleasure. I love it!<br /><br />The 2nd best PF cd. My fave is \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\", IMO. So buy this today!
B00003CXPD|5.0|Billy Elliott combines all the elements of a successful, satisfying movie: comedy and drama; relationships between father/son, brother/brother, adult/child and friend/friend. Watching the relationship and understanding evolve between father and son is definitely the highlight of the movie. It is not just for dance fans; it is for anyone who enjoys a heartwarming story. Definitely one of my favorites!
B0009IW88A|4.0|Loved the movie, finding it a lot more thoughtful, subtle and character-focused than I expected. <br />This soundtrack does lack a bold hero theme, such as the easily recognisable Danny Elfman music from the first two films, or the garish and derivative Elliot Goldenthal stuff from the other two. However this approach suits the film perfectly as you can see the potential for such a theme to slowly develop as the characters do in each film. <br />Some really good Hans Zimmer action pieces with pulse-pounding bass, complemented nicely by some softer pieces guided by James Newton Howard, mainly to accompany the film's bittersweet flashback sequences. <br />You can be forgiven for thinking the album is one long piece, as most tracks have elements of each other, even if only in the background. <br />Perhaps not the sort of background music for your cocktail party or family gathering. However if you enjoy sitting in the dark and practicing your brooding (well, who doesn't?!), then this is just the ticket. <br />And a couple of tracks (8 and 10) make a nice addition to your daily workout background mix. <br />Seriously, if you really like the film then you'll appreciate this. More subtle and gritty than any superhero soundrack I've ever heard, but I think it's for the best. <br />A classy beginning, not what I expected, and a solid base to build on for the next film. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an original, extremely fun, cliche-less combination of  western and space-faring. Is that possible? Yes, because the stories are very well written, with attention to detail and packed with good humor and plot twists, the actors are awesome and the general look (ship design, costumes, weapons, special effects, etc) is quite believable. <br /> <br />The pilot episode starts rather suddenly, without much explaining of the main characters, but as the show goes on one gradually finds out more about Serenity's crew. After the first DVD I was a complete Firefly addict. However, after watching it all, I feel many promises were unfulfilled [chinese muttering]. <br /> <br />I can't believe anyone in his right mind would cancel such a wonderful series just when things started to get more interesting. The upcoming Serenity movie is good news though, and I'll be sure to bring all my friends to see it.
B000002KHH|5.0|Wether you're a newcomer to Sabbath or a long time listener, this album is essential to own. With such classics as Paranoid, Iron Man and War Pigs, this is Sabbath at their best. Sound quality is amazing and well remastered. This is a must own for any metal fans
B0009UVBQI|3.0|I bought this DVD thinking it would be the same as the original overseas version but with english as an audio option. It did but I was very surprised that they edited certain shots. Scenes where blood spilled out or sputtered out of people in fight scenes were digitally removed. Why? I have no idea. If you ever saw the original DVD (Chinese version) you'll understand what I am saying. Editing is stupid. Let the people decide what's good or not for themselves. <br />Also the Blooper Gag reel is nothing to laugh at. Literally. <br />The interview is boring and the commentary is in Chinese only (Unless I missed something) <br />By best advice is if you can get the original version, do so.
1573223026|5.0|Hornby has a great knack for creating interesting characters who are a bit flawed and amazingly ill-equipped to face the challenges life throws their way. In A LONG WAY DOWN he gathers four such flawed people at the top of an office tower on New Year's Eve, each one having come there for different reasons but all with the same purpose--to commit suicide. Martin is a vacuous and dishonored TV personality (he just finished a short prison term for having sexual relations with a minor); Maureen, the mother of a severely disabled son; Jess, a spoiled and foul-mouthed daughter of the minister of education, whose sister went missing years ago; and JJ, an unsuccessful American rock musician whose band recently split up and whose girlfriend consequently left him.<br /><br />On the surface, Hornby seems to given himself a writer's workshop challenge: take four people who have absolutely nothing in common and intertwine their destinies. What he has created, though, seems very honest-a study of arbitrariness itself. That the reader ends up liking this collection of sad-sacks, whiners, blamers, and Teflon-coated losers is a miracle (though probably not a surprise to readers of ABOUT A BOY and HOW TO BE GOOD). And along the way, these oddball characters charm us with their wit (or bowl us over with their appalling lack of it). For instance, Jess observes of men like Martin, \\"They think women are like laptops...My old one is knackered and anyway, you can get ones that are slimmer and do more stuff now.\\" As a character-driven piece of fiction, this is a great read--fast-paced, and lots of fun.<br /><br />But I enjoyed it on another level as well. While I always avoid novels about writing novels, this one succeeds because none of the characters are writers, or even want to be writers. In fact, the characters are so wrapped up in their own narcissistic mishegoss that it's amazing that they ever have time to observe one another, let alone reflect on what is going on around them. And by making them non-writers, Hornby seems to be making a comparison between living and writing (not a new comparison, but cleverly drawn nonetheless). Naturally worked into the conversations, his characters reflect on the nature and power of storytelling, as well as on writerly subjects like point of view, similes and metaphors, causality, credibility, pretense, the plausibility and predictability of endings, the role of coincidence, metacommunication, tabloid prose, and reading as anti-social behavior. When Jess bluntly observes that \\"Everyone knows how to talk, and no one knows what to say,\\" she certainly seems to be speaking directly for Horby himself.  But in the end, it is perhaps Maureen, the most desperate of the quartet who speaks for Hornby most when she reflects on the reality of her mentally disabled son, Matty, \\"I only know one person in the world who doesn't need stories to keep himself going, and that person is Matty.\\" For her, and for each of the characters in the story (and by extension, for all of us), having a story and risking sharing it is the same as having a life and living it...even though no one can never know for sure how theirs will come out in the end.And by making them non-writers, Hornby seems to be making a comparison between living and writing (not a new comparison, but cleverly drawn nonetheless).

014100018X|3.0|I found Chocolat on the whole unimpressive.<br /><br />However there are some portions which are quite charming - the magic which is woven in small ceremonies,the warmth of the mother daughter relationship and ofcourse the delightful character of Armande with her endless joie de vivre and her red silk slips.<br /><br />The best portion of the book are the last two chapters - in one Reynaud, the village priest finally gives in to his wild supressed temptation for choclate, the description is very good. The last chapter is the essence of the book,what goes on in Vianne's heart,mind and soul and what she finally decides - to stay or to move on with the winds as usual, quite beautifully written.

B00003CX5P|4.0|In modern cinema there is one series of films above all others that has had the biggest impact in one form or another.  Whether the impact is from the groundbreaking CGI effects, revival of a dying genre, epic story telling, or even down to the type of camera used from film to digital, one man and his dream have helped to lead the way in ushering in the next modern age of cinema.  That man is director George Lucas, and his dream is the incredible space saga that began over 20 years ago, `Star Wars'.  In 1977, George Lucas wowed audiences with his epic space saga that took all of us to a galaxy far, far away.  With that initial movie now known as, \\"Star Wars - Episode 4: A New Hope\\" (back when it was initially released it was known simply as \\"Star Wars\\"), we fell in love with the widest assortment of characters ranging from humans (Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi) to the lovable aliens (Chewbacca, Yoda, and yes even the Ewoks), to the most hated, yet we can't seem to get enough of villains (Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and the Emperor).  Lucas held sway over our collective consciousness with his initial trilogy of films that spanned from 1977 to 1983, and at the end leaving audiences wanting more, and more specifically the first three chapters in his 6-part story.  Finally, over 20 years later George Lucas delivered with \\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\". <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\" sets all of the balls into motion that would lead to the events that audiences had already witnessed with the original trilogy.  The basic plotline of the story without going into too much detail, just in case there is still someone that hasn't seen any of this series, is as follows.  There is a growing darkness in the galaxy, as the Trade Federation is threatening to take over the planet Naboo, home to Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) who happens to have a seat on the Galactic Republic Senate, and is one of its most valued members.  To save the Queen, the Jedi Council headed by Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), send out 2 of their best Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and a much younger Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).  Through their quest to save the Queen and bring her safely to the Republic's capital city on Coruscant, the Jedi encounter Jar-Jar Binks (by far the most annoying character in the entire `Star Wars' universe) and a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd).  The discovery of young Anakin, prompts Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan to see to it that Anakin is trained in the ways of the Force.  As Qui-Gon and the council are beginning to believe that Anakin is more than just another Jedi, he may be the `Chosen One', one of the most powerful Jedi, and who would bring balance back to the Force, allowing the Jedi to overcome the impending evil that is arising in the form of the Sith, led by Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Maul. <br /> <br />With all the hype surrounding the return of the `Star Wars' saga, it really comes as no surprise that \\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\" somewhat failed to meet expectations.  With that much hype, I really don't believe any movie could have overcome the public's belief of what the film should be.  Critics hated the film, citing that it was too much of a kid's movie, with an over-reliance on CGI characters and effects, and incredibly wooden acting and dialogue.  Many of the core fans of the series deserted after the release of this movie, but were brought back into the fold 3 years later with the release of `Episode 2'.  My thoughts are that though this movie was a little more `kiddie' than the previous installments, it kind of had to be due to the fact that we were starting Anakin Skywalker's journey as a young boy, and through this prequel trilogy he would age and progress on his journey towards the Dark Side of the Force, until his ultimate betrayal of all that was good inside him when he transforms into Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith.  Also, any nay-sayers should really hold their comments until after they have seen the entire prequel trilogy so they could get a feel for the overall story, though I thought the overall story was presented with a very good and very strong beginning with \\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\", and the overall story only got stronger with the next 2 installments. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of the original `Star Wars' trilogy, or just generally love really good sci-fi movies or want to watch a movie series that feels epic and grand, then the `Star Wars' saga is definitely for you, and now the entire series has been released and is available to watch. <br /> <br />\\"Star Wars - Episode 1: The Phantom Menace\\" is rated PG for violence.
B000002UAR|5.0|The Beatles started to experiment in the studio already on HELP! back in 1965, thoug it was not in big scales (the mind-blowing \\"Ticket To Ride\\" from HELP! can actually be seen as the very precursor to the deep-psychedelic sound-experimential \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" on REVOLVER. Similarities shows up in the drum beat, in the continuous first chord of \\"Ticket To Ride\\" that remains past the whole \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", the high-lying bass tone, the ringing sound of the instruments etc,etc...) However, The Beatles went further on the roads of a-changing in the other half of '65 when the even more subtle, wall-breaking, sound-experimenting RUBBER SOUL was realeased. The mix of proto-psychedelic songs such as \\"Ticket To Ride\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"The Word\\", more sophisticated lyrics as for example \\"In My Life\\" and songs using different instuments such as \\"Yo've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" (flute), \\"Yesterday\\" (strings), \\"Norweigen Wood\\" (sitar) and \\"Think For Yourself\\" (fuzz bass) was to become the 1966 realease REVOLVER. But then, REVOLVER is something compleatley new. According to me, RUBBER SOUL is more like HELP! then REVOLVER. <br /> <br />The album starts with Harrisons \\"Taxman\\", a rough rocker that isn't afraid of spit the English community in the face! It has a hungry guitarsolo played by McCartney. <br />The second track is a McCartney classic; \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". This is probably the first pop record to handle the theme \\"death\\" without irony. It's even the first to use no other instruments than strings. <br />\\"Eleanor Rigby\\" is followed by Lennons \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", a psychedelic, almost hypnotic, ballad. It has a dazzling guitarsolo by Harrison, played backwards! This was an effect that <br />The Beatles used much trough the REVOLVER sessions. <br />The fourth song, \\"Love You To\\", marked Harrisons first real trip to the Indian music. It is some kind of philosophic love song, were we see Harrison on sitar, backed-up by other Indian musicians. <br />\\"Here, There And Everywhere\\", the fifth track, is a sweet McCartney ballad 'bout love. It is said to being inspiread by The Beach Boys classic \\"God Only Knows\\". <br />Ringo handles the lead vocal on the sixth track, a singalong childrens whyme, made as a joke. And yes-you guessed right, it's \\"Yellow Submarine\\" we're talkin'about. <br />The follow up to \\"Submarine\\" is really the opposite to that song. Lennons death-serious \\"She Said She Said\\". Lyrics based on an acid trip, this psychedelic rock contains some intresting sound effects. <br />Next song, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" by McCartney, perfectly recalls how it is being in love when the weather's fine. Completed with the swinging honky tonk piano solo. <br />Ninth track, Lennons \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", contains a driving riff with some rather raw guitar sounds. Lennon sings as good as ever. <br />\\"For No One\\", the tenth song, is a 4/4 waltz by McCartney. The sad lyrics is about a relationship standing at the edge of ruin. It has a very well-played French horn solo. <br />Lennons \\"Doctor Robert\\", the eleventh track, seems to be a rather basic rock song until the middle-part comes, witch is changing the tracks character. Lyrics could possibly be about a \\"doctor\\" that's cuering folks with LSD. <br />The twelvth track is Harrisons Indie-ispiread \\"I Want To Tell You\\", witch shows up some unusual chord-changes; typically for Harrison, thoug. <br />Thirteenth is a very intresting song called \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\", signed McCartney. It has a majestic brass sound, and it's building up energy until the realeasing chorus. Strong vocals by McCartney. <br />The last track on REVOLVER was like nothing The Beatles had did before it. Debatable the most psychedelic song the group ever recorded, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" contains some very special sound effects, managed by the use of bandloops and backward playing. Lennon wrote the song during an acid (LSD) trip just like \\"She Said She Said\\", the diffrence is that \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" seems to really be about the drug itself. Strangely, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is without doubt the most extreme track on the LP, altough it was the first one to be recorded. <br /> <br />1966 was a year when pop music pointed out new directoins. It was not only The Beatles who found new ways; The Beach Boys classic PET SONDS was really different from their earlier records, and The Rolling Stones AFTERMATH was something of a change for them. Even groups as The Kinks evolved a lot during '66. <br /> <br />Lennon, McCartney and Harrison reached their creative peak with the work on REVOLVER (according to me). Songs like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", \\"Taxman\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" have changed music history forever. Not to forget the fantastic \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", my personal favourite. REVOLVER is absolutly The Beatles best record, followed by SGT. PEPPER. A record collection without REVOLVER isn't complete. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000001FFR|4.0|Anthrax, in the early days of the band at least, were always adept at staying one jump ahead of the pack. Starting in the early eighties as a bona fide, stage armour wearing 'true' metal band, their main musical protagonists, drummer Charlie Benante, rhythm guitarist Scott Ian and bassist Danny Lilker were all keen afficionados of punk and sensed a coming together of the two genres- crossover was on it's way and they needed to be at it's forefront. So the Priest and Maiden stylings of debut Fistful Of Metal were dropped, to be replaced by the out and out Hardcore mayhem of \\"Spreading The Disease\\". And while some of the band's more unlikely crowd pleasing gestures didn't sit well with the image they were trying to portray (the Ramones apeing prompt boards and the wholesale misuse of the famous New York Hardcore Symbol for merchandise purposes) it's an undeniable fact that the music they came up for for this album is terrific. Opener A.I.R. was a titanic piece of stadium thrash, whilst the heads down, see you at the end speed workouts Stand Or Fall and the aptly named Gung Ho were guaranteed to please both longhaired and mohawked fans alike. They even came close to a hit single with the fantastic, grinding anthem Madhouse. It was the sound of a band finding it's creative feet and, whilst they never sounded this undilutedly good again, it points to the greater (if not better) things that were ahead for the band.

B00068NVI4|5.0|On May 1st  2004, I was treated to an incredible Evening in Tampa. I had Floor Seats, and as this Concert was held in an Ice Arena, many of us were Freezing! Jon even mentioned how Cold it was while he was blowing his Hands, as was Rick. So Today I bought the 35th Anniversary Concert DVD, not knowing what to expect. If  you read the Postings on Yesworld about this final Night at Tsongas, there were  many complaints because of the Heat. This DVD is Special, Magical, Wonderful, and perhaps the best produced YES DVD ever. Right off you notice the Video quality is  Crystal Clear!. No puzzle like images that you see from Film transferred DVD's. And none of that \\"artistic\\" crap that just destroys a Concert DVD. The Sound was fantastic!  This was pure Yes at their Finest, and it might just be their last Concert we will ever see?.  I loved when Jon said he forgot the words to \\"Time is Time\\", and turned away from the Mic and said \\"let's do Roundabout instead\\". The whole group busted up, Rick was amazed! Isn't it Rick who has always played with Sheet Music, yet used none on this Tour! And no Prompter for Jon either! If I only had one wish, which is now just half a wish after seeing this great DVD, it would have been Yes releasing a DVD from their \\"Classic Yes 2002 Tour\\". I saw them playing on a dormant Volcano at Konocti in California. It was their second show back with Rick, and it was awesome!. Mistakes, yes there were a few, but it was a Classic Show & a Classic Tour. Unfortunately  I went back for their final Show in Las Vegas almost 2 Months later, and Jon had lost his voice, and the band was very tired. That's why I think so highly of this final show at Tsongas in the sweltering heat. Funny thing though, they didn't look too hot, I bet their were some portable A/C Units on stage, just for them?. Another observation,  Jon did \\"Rhythm of Love\\" differently then in Tampa. There he started up on the Stage & then just appeared walking the Floor, I actually got to touch Jon, Isle Seats do have their advantage! And that the Tsongas Concert closed with \\"Starship Trooper\\", rather than \\"Soon\\" made this concert even more special. And I did get chills when Jon said, \\"we're going to play our last song now\\",  Imagine if this truly was their last song  we will ever see or hear from the World's Greatest bunch of Musicians. As another poster so eloquently said, woo!
B000003CMB|4.0|Many reviewers here would have you believe that 'The Allman Brothers Band At Fillmore East' is the finest rock show ever recorded.  That's not only a subjective claim, but it's lofty and debatable as well.  Certainly a concert recorded at the same venue just months prior to these March 1971 gigs, Derek & the Dominos 'Live At the Fillmore East' give the Allmans a substantial run for their money.  The compositions offered by Clapton are unquestionably superior, and Clapton is up to his brow in guitar genius, arguably at the virtual peak of his performing career.  On the other hand, the Allmans are a tighter composite band, Gregg's vocals are more skillfully (often gut-wrenchingly) delivered, and Duane claims a specialized expertise on the slide guitar unmatched in rock lore, and documented more clearly here than anywhere else in the Allman catalog.  How about calling it a tie?  Probably too much like kissing your sister for the Allman's base of fans. <br /> <br />All that being said, there is no question that this is one of the finest performances ever released on vinyl, magnetic tape, and digital stock.  I always attributed much of the Allman's success on the presence of not one, but two elite lead guitarists (Dickey Betts and Duane Allman), and not one, but two drum kits, one occupied by Jai Johanny Johanson and another by Butch Trucks.  These unique elements, more than anything else distinguish the Allman sound from their competitors and imitators.  I especially enjoy listening to their recordings on stereo headphones, picking up their combined backbeats and guitar progressions, a seperate one for each ear.  It's pretty remarkable how these percussion artists can perform slightly different styles and still blend in perfectly with the rest of the band, seemingly never stepping into one another's place in the music.  It's also remarkable that Betts and Duane can find plenty of room for both of their prodigious talents, along with Gregg's meanderings on organ, and notsound muddled at any point in time.  It's everything a band should be. <br /> <br />That's not to say these discs don't have some drawbacks.  Number one is that the setlist doesn't get to a track composed by the Allman's until 'Hot 'Lanta' pops up on side three of the original vinyl release.  Only 3 of the seven tracks are penned by the band, and only one of those offers any vocals.  Good thing the band is so accomplished instrumentally, because they certainly don't rely on their lyrical talents.  While the band only had two studio albums behind them at the time these live discs were recorded, some of their compositions, such as Gregg's 'Midnight Rider' could have been featured.  Instead, the first four tracks are a collection of blues covers.  The Allmans breathe new life into each and every one, transforming them into immediate southern blues-rock classics.  'Stormy Monday' has been covered by everyone from Albert King to Eric Clapton to Mountain, and the Allman's offer their own smooth rendition.  Their nearly nine minute version does get a bit lost however, but not as lost as the nineteen-plus minute version of Willie Cobbs 'You Don't Love Me', which descends into a nearly two-minute guitar solo (solo in this case meaning 'alone') in the middle.  I'll take the over-the-top psychedelic version offered by Al Kooper and Stephen Stills on the 'Super Session' disc anyday. <br /> <br />The best tracks on 'At Fillmore East' open and close the disc.  'Statesboro Blues', and 'Done Somebody Wrong' are tight, well-executed blues numbers, and the closers, 'In Memory of Elizabeth Reed' is a stirring instrumental, while 'Whipping Post' is arguably one of the band's most intense productions.  Despite my respect for this recording, I find their follow-up release, 'Eat a Peach', to be clearly superior, indeed the band's masterwork.  Duane, despite being lost in a motorcycle accident, is still prominently featured in both live and studio tracks, Dickey Betts is peaking as a composer, and we're treated to a wealth of memorable songs penned by the band.  Truth is, both releases are essential elements of any comprehensive rock music collection. <br /> <br />
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Dido sings many of the songs from her first two cd's, See You When You're Forty, Life For Rent, My Life and Thank-you are all done beautifully.  She also talks personally to the audience and you learn a lot about the struggles in her life and why some of the songs were written.  The sound is very clear and the camera angles are great.  If you like Dido then I would advise not passing this up. It's the closest you're going to get to a concert as her website does not currently have any tours scheduled.  Unlike some concert DVD's you can't hear the crowd screaming in the background which often takes away from the enjoyment.  There is also a CD in this set which is from the concert but does not have all the DVD songs due to space issues on the CD, nevertheless it is an enjoyable CD.

While not as good as the other two Evil Dead films this one is still a great movie. This movie thrives off of a passion for films and filmmaking. Sam Raimi's great camerawork is on display as usual. Bruce Campbell is at his best here as smartmouthed grumpy Ash. There is nothing to dislike here, this is a movie made for movie lovers.
B00082IJ08|5.0|When Gorillaz first came out with their self titled debut album, a lot of music fans were blown away with the CD's musical tempo. From the smallest minor keys in the background to the awesome bass found in many of their songs, it was a CD that had a track for anyone. Now with this second album, Gorillaz was looked down upon, with a negative look on this album, many people skeptical that it wouldn't match with the first. But as thier single \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" came out, we were once again hit with a musical sound that would keep us repeating the rhythm and chorus such as the likes of \\"Clint Eastwood\\", and \\"19-2000\\", and though one of their artistical music influences left, thier sound has never been better, from the infecting bass of \\"Kids With Guns\\", to the rap lyrics of \\"Dirty Harry\\" and \\"November Has Come\\", the CD \\"Demon Days\\" passes the standard of a sophomore album and takes us all into their world of musical rhythm and sound.
6305313687|5.0|This movie was a great movie. My dad and I watched it together and my dad was shocked on how realistic this movie was. It showed how hatered destory's and seperates families. It is also interesting that it doesn't condem the characters but shows how they change from hate filled people to loving people. It was only that it was to late. <br />  This movie is the best movie to use to teach kids about hatered and how it destroys instead of constructing.

B0000035E7|1.0|I love Bleach. I'm a self-confessed Pop fan. You name it, I love it-- Madonna, Michael Jackson, Guns & Roses, Duran Duran, etc. Pop Rock is my fave, with Nirvana and Guns & Roses leading the charge of RAWK. Sure, Kurdt and Axdl hated each other when their bands were rivals, but so what! They get along just fine alongside each other on my I-Pod. \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Teen Spirit\\", \\"Billie Jean\\", and \\"Material Girl\\" are the ultimate songs of rebellion. Despite what the previous reviewer said, it just ain't true that Bleach is inaccessable. \\"About a Girl\\" isn't just the only Pop song... all of them are Pop(ular), including the heavy Pop Rock of \\"Paper Cuts\\".
B0000VD04M|5.0|This movie is a highly enjoyable film featuring one of Johnny Depp's best performances. The supporting cast is excellent as well particulary Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi. Bill Murray also puts in a hilarious performance as well. A great cast in an unlikely film about B film master Ed Wood. The topic may seem a strange one but it sure turned out to be pure movie magic in the end.
B0000931QR|5.0|\\"Lo que te conte mientras te hacias la dormida\\" was nominated for many prestigious awards and nominations, including \\"Premios lo Nuestro\\" amd \\"Premios Amigo.\\" Right after its release, it sold an outstanding half million copies in Spain and another half million copies in North and South America. At this point, this album has exceed the One and a half million copies and doesn't stop. <br />   Here's a description and rating of each song in this album: <br /> <br />Puedes Contar Conmigo- Its first single. Very energetic, written entirely by Amaia (the vocalist.) In my opinion, my favorite song. R: 5/5 <br /> <br />20 de enero- Also very energetic. Beautiful, romantic lyrics. R: 4.5/5  <br /> <br />Rosas- The BIG hit! Another single. Not as energetic as the previous 2 songs but beautiful lyrics. This is more of like a pop ballad. This song ranked in #1 in Mexico and Spain and ranked one of the highest positions in the U.S. and other countries.  Definately, one of my favorites. R: 5/5 <br /> <br />Deseos de cosas imposibles- Its third single. Filled with energy and figurative language including metaphors. R: 4/5 <br /> <br />Geografia- The last single. You can dance you can sing to this song you can do whatever you want with this song. The lyrics talk about two people in love wanting to live alone in this isolated planet. Very romantic. R: 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Un Mundo Mejor- This song makes me travel to countries were poverty is present like in the countries of South America. There's just something I like about this song but I can't figure it out. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Tu y Yo- Very sweet melody. Contains the voice of Xabier San Martin which sings this song with Amaia. Wonderful melody. R:4.5/5 <br /> <br />La Esperanza Debida- My second favorite after Puedes Contar Conmigo. They Lyrics almost makes me cry. Its filled with passion, feeling, grief... The lyrics talk about a people trying to escape their country and immigrate to a better country and they fail in their intent... R: 5/5 <br /> <br />Vestido Azul- My favorite part is the intro. It has a touch of Rock and Roll. Like La Esperanza Debida, is filled with feeling but the feeling is different. Not very much to say about this song. R: 3.5/5 <br /> <br />Adios- Love the lyrics. I like when it says \\"Ven, calmate no llores mas si cierras los ojos veras que sigo aqui junto a ti...\\" Somehow when I listen to this song, it remembers me of Amaia Montero. R: 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Perdoname- Different from all the other songs. Different kind of instruments used or something. Everything is just so different... the music, the lyrics. Everything. R: 4/5 <br /> <br />La paz de tus ojos- My favorite part of the song is when it says, \\"Que necesito la paz que se esconde en tus ojos y esa ancia en tu boca que te da la razon. Ven cuentame aquella historia de princesas de amores que un dia te conte yo...\\" The feeling that's obviously found here is Passion. My third favorite. R: 5/5 <br /> <br />Nadie como tu- Another ballad. I think this was just a filler song. Very dull, boring. The only thing I like is that's kind of romantic but nothing compared to \\"Rosas.\\" R: 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Historia de un Sueo- This Song Breaks my heart. I mean the Music, the lyrics, everything is so hearbreaking! If you already have this album pay attention to the lyrics. It will make you cry. I can't explain you just have to hear it. R: 5/5 <br /> <br />Bonustrack[Untitled]- The hidden track. I was so surprised when I heard this song! I was listening to Historia de un Sueo and right after it finished I thought The CD will stop! But instead this great music started to surround me. This is the most electric, energetic song out of La Oreja de Van Gogh's career. I just love this song. If you don't have this album you should buy it so you can listen to this outstanding song. R: 5/5     <br />   Overall this Album is not good... It's Excellent! Every song has it's own style. What a masterpiece. What a Music Bliss!  <br />The cover art is also so GREAT! What A great oppurtunity For Amaia to show off her looks! Everything is so Awesome about this band. They're Great. I hoped you learned more about this album.  Amaia is such a beauty. She's flawless. <br /> <br />Recommended: Of Course!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy this CD. Why RESIST?
6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pocus has been my favorite movie since I was 6 and I'm now 13. I watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. I highly recomend this movie to anyone. The charecters are great and the story is creative. It follows Max,Dani,and Alison in Salem,MA Running from the 3 Sanderson sisters and trying to warn others of plans to suck the lives from children

0385336810|5.0|Generally speaking I think Sophie Kinsella's books are the best contemporary Chick Lit I have read.  Can you keep a secret? is my favourite book of all time in that genre.  I wont try and describe it as I don't want to give away one precious secret other than to say that this book is as good as it gets - IMHO.
B00005JKN9|2.0|The only reason this one doesn't get 1 star is Daniel Day Lewis who is impressive in this movie as he is in all others. Dicaprio and Diaz however are laughably bad in this, and the movie is meandering and often seems lost in it's own murk. I would only reccomend this to Day Lewis fans, Scorsese fans should skip it because it doesn't add anything to what he has done, this one is kind of an embarassment. Scorsese has had his great films like Goodfellas and Taxi Driver, that's why I've been confused with his recent stuff, The Aviator wasn't that great either. My advice is simple...Dicaprio, DeNiro you are not.
B0009MDPYW|1.0|Stupid Keanu Reeves horror picture that lacks a competent director, a leading man who can act and a screenplay worth it's weight on the paper it was printed on. Keanu Reeves fumbles so badly in his role, that you do begin to fell sorry for him. Yes, he has his charm and his moments but his character is just a whining little boy and the screenplay does not help him endeared himself to the audience with really stupid dialog and plot holes so big, you can drive a truck through them. The special effects are good but repetitive and the direction needed a lot more dazzle for me to buy what was going on in the movie.  The only actor here who does make this movie bearable is Rachel Weisz and she is literally holding you attention by herself while you are tempted to turn off the Dvd player. Her performance does deserve better than the really bad movie she is in and deserves the praise it's getting because she does try to make you care about what is going on in the film. That's in itself a huge praise from me considering the fact I really did not care much for the film itself.

B00079FUI6|5.0|An appealing and engrossing series that combines a number of genre (comedy, drama, satire, mystery, romance etc.) not just with originality but with really entertaining execution. I was impressed at how the series was able to maintain a cohesive web of plots for the entire season that supports the clues/ideas they presented in the earlier episodes. It was evident that the writers have an outline to the direction of the series. <br /> <br />The show has a great ensemble. The four housewives made their roles their own. Teri Hatcher was very charming and competent handling the slapstick of her character and once in awhile she shows her dramatic chops. She was a revelation. Marcia Cross, who seems to be the crowd favorite was pitch perfect. She played the most interesting and the most complex character in the show. Felicity Huffman gets to play the most relatable housewife and she was just heartbreaking in all her dramatic scenes (the soccer field, telling her husband he doesn't think of her as sexy as he used to). Eva Longoria was good especially with comedy part. I think she needs meatier stories in the next season to explore the more dramatic aspect of her character.          <br /> <br /> <br />Here are my 5 favorite episodes of the season: <br /> <br />                             **********Possible Spoiler*********** <br /> <br />1. Pilot - One of the best pilots I've seen. The setup for the main characters was superb because you already connected to each of them. Some very memorable scenes (Lynette in the pool, Gabriel mowing the lawn in her gown, Susan burning Edie's house, Bree sobbing quietly in the bathroom etc.) <br /> <br />2. Pretty Little Picture - One line sums up this episode perfectly \\"Rex cries after he ejaculates\\"  <br /> <br />3. The Ladies Who Lunch - a rare instance where all four of the storylines were superb. I love how the theme of the episode (gossip) was sort of evident/relevant in the individual storylines.  <br /> <br />4. Impossible - A great Teri Hatcher episode, she proved that the accolades she's been receiving were no fluke.   <br /> <br />5. Fear No More - a great ensemble episode that brought most of the characters together in one place. I hope in the next season they do episodes that are more ensemble oriented because towards the end of the series, the interactions among the housewives and with the supporting characters were lacking.   <br /> <br />Other notable episodes are: Guilty (a dramatic showcase for Felicity Huffman), Suspicious Minds, Running to Stand Still, and One wonderful Day.  <br /> <br />Grade: A
B0000019PA|5.0|Wheezing, stumbling, radiant and death-obsessed, this record embodies all that's good about humanity.  The gorgeous inside art is ravishing too.  I loved it from the first second I heard one of the samples, and it's remained one of my 5 favorite records to this day.  I don't think this record grows on you; I think it just explodes into bloom in your mind the second you hear it.  My guess is that most of the 5-star-givers here feel the same way.  I guess my point is, if you're listening to 30 seconds of \\"the king of carrot flowers\\" or \\"ghost\\" or \\"the fool\\" and you're frowning, In The Aeroplane probably just is not for you.  And that's OK.  But if it's tickling you, or hooking you, or haunting you, give in.  Get into the plane.  We're only here for a moment.  And that's all right.
B00004YYDI|5.0|I recommend the European version of this one over the original American cut, it restores the innocent love story element that puritanical Americans who love violence would have found to frightening to watch. This movie is a stellar work in directing, acting and story. Natalie Portman burst onto the screen with a grace that is rare even with adult screen debuts. This movie is at the same time touching and thrilling. Equal parts stylish action segments and emtional bonding between a hitman and the young orphaned girl he takes in and protects from a corrupt cop played with delicious menace by Gary Oldman. What ensues is ultimately a father daughter story set against the back drop of human experience, loss, love, redemption, revenge, corruption, and hope. A must see film.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|As a Star Trek fan I really like this film with the added bonus and features. I think this is a great buy in my opinion. Wish they had these films in full screen. That would of toped it for me. Thanks
B0006A9FKA|5.0|First off, i give it 5 stars because i AM slightly biased. I absolutley loved the film, thought it was hilarious but there are a  few reasons why i would.. <br /> <br />First off its British, and so am i. Do the 'maths'.  <br /> <br />Secondly, and more importantly, its a result of Simon Pegg, who has been (as we say here) round the houses in terms of British comedy, and is part of the integral circle of present day Brit comics some of which you may be familiar with (Ricky Gervais in The Office, Steve Coogan in Alan Partridge). So for me to see Simon Pegg make it onto the bigscreen in a film that is basically 'his' was a real joy. <br /> <br />Not that it matters at all, but to those who are interested, Simon Pegg had his own Sitcom here in the UK called 'Spaced' , where he basically plays a pretty useless stoner who draws comic art for a living but doesnt really have a proper job and has a collection of absurd housemates and it follows their random adventures. Also starring in the series was Nick Frost (Ed) as a military obsessive housemate/best friend, and Daisy, who also plays a small part in the film. This was a great series, that picked up a very cult following (being on the UK's Channel 4, the mother of all Cult channels here). If you enjoyed this film and Simon Pegg's humour, and the great dialogue and banter between him and Nick, then you should look this up! <br /> <br />Anyway im rambling. What i loved about this film is exactly what i loved about the series Spaced. It's the hidden jokes, its the little gems that he has left in there, quotes and homages to films he clearly loves - many of which are soundbytes me and my friends use quite often . For example when Shaun climbs out the sunroof of the Jag and Nick says 'watch the leather man' - dazed and confused! love it <br /> <br />I havent seen the US edit, im just going to assume its the same - i can see why some of this film might have confused people, but really the accents in this film are pretty much London based entirely, very few people have any harsh regional accent that would throw people out. Given, some things are specific to the UK market like people on here have mentioned (some of the TV shows, the news presenters, the little mention of the woeful, hideous daytime TV program 'Trisha' that is famously watched by hungover and binged out students) but for the mostpart its pretty easy to get all the lines. <br /> <br />Another great piece of work was the 'doppelgangers'. That group of people that represent each of Shauns group like for like. Each of them are also in Sitcoms (little Britain, The league of Gentlemen) or have been along side Pegg in other stuff.  <br /> <br />As for the high swear count, we are a pretty foul mouthed nation believe it or not, so i guess i didn't even think about that. The use of the 'C' word was so funny i choked on my drink anyway :) <br /> <br />Anyway truly this film is great fun, and its typical and perfect Simon Pegg, for those that care - look into 'Spaced' for more similar fun on a lower budget :)
B00008AY3L|2.0|If Ben Harper was a better artist, his music would be called \\"eclectic\\". His 2003 release, Diamonds on the Inside, experiments with nearly as many genres as there are songs. <br /> <br />The album begins with a reggae song, \\"With My Own Two Hands\\", which is probably the best track on the album. The second song, \\"When It's Good\\" is an upbeat acoustic slide number that ends up being OK, but not much better than that. He continues the acoustic theme (but this time with a fuller sound) with the title track that begins, embarassingly enough, with the following lyrics: \\"I met a girl/her name was Truth/she was a horrible liar\\". The first time I heard this song, I grimaced, and asked someone who it was. <br /> <br />\\"Ben Harper,\\" the person said. \\"Isn't he awesome?\\" <br /> <br />I knew of Ben Harper, and remembered some of his earlier songs, which I recalled to be politically-charged numbers. This, I thought, really sucks. So when my sister bought the album for the US equivalent of about nine dollars new, I thought I'd give Ben a chance and see if he could redeem himself. He didn't. <br /> <br />\\"Touch From Your Lust\\" (ugh) is the fourth track on Diamonds, and begins the third (or maybe fourth if you really want to be specific) distinct genre change on the album. \\"Touch\\" is a hard rock power ballad, with interweaved psychedelic overtones and even more crappy lyrics: \\"Scars on your back /tell where you've been/ButI'll roll like the ocean/If you'll blow like the wind/Sweet Texas angel/What have your blue eyes seen/I'll be your country gentleman/If you will be my Mason Dixon queen\\". <br /> <br />We move on to \\"When She Believes\\" which switches into French romanticism mode, complete with accordian, harp, and celeste. The rest of the album is a mix of funk, hard country-rock, and one song, \\"Picture of Jesus\\", that utilizes an African chorus and is probably runner-up to the intro track. Not a bad song if you don't listen to what he says. (Not that I have anything against Jesus.)<br /> <br />A few years ago, I heard someone praising Lenny Kravitz, saying that \\"he writes all his own songs, and he plays his own instruments--that's more than I can say for Britney Spears and The Backstreet Boys.\\" Right, so because he writes his own songs and plays his own instruments, he's supposed to be allowed a higher threshold of crappiness or something? The same people who are willing to give Lenny props for writing his own music are probably in the same bracket of those who would do the same for Ben. They shouldn't. Crap is crap, and it shouldn't matter whether it was put together by studio suits, professional songwriters, or the artists themselves. <br /> <br />Ben Harper is good music for sixteen-year-olds who want more than what's being played on the radio. Diamonds on the Inside can be used as an introduction for that same age group into something different than what they're used to, even if it's not necessarily any better.
6305161879|5.0|This movie is a flawlesly funny film. Kevin Kline is drop to the floor hilarious in this movie. It is a well written, well acted movie that is as funny the 30th time around as it was the first time. One of the all time great comedies.
B00004RERW|5.0|Quality is very good ... music is pretty decent if you like Celine Dion ... a lovely SACD to own. <br /> <br />I bought this to show friends and family my system - basically my own demo SACD. The problem is that this disc doesn't like Sony machines (despite being a Sony Music title). I've tried it on 3 seperate DVP-NS955 machines and they all die at the same place (track 6 01:06 minutes during multichannel).  <br /> <br />I even have a 2nd copy which I tried as well, and also freezes at that point. I decided to try a LS780 Sony machine which died at the same place as all the 955s. At this point it seems though the SACD is defective, but please remember I used 2 new copies! Also, decided to try this on a Marantz, Yamaha and a few other models - which work perfectly. In all, I have tried this on 8 different players.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Ok, so first of all, I am not a big Mariah fan, but I decided to give this one a try.  I was happily surprised at how much I have listened to this CD!  Out of the first 3 singles I like \\"Shake It Off\\" the best (but I'm sure I'll get tired of this one soon...). \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" got played out real fast. <br /> <br />There are some good songs on this album tho...\\"One and Only\\" feat. Twista is hot with a good beat. You can really get into \\"Say Somethin'\\", \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", & \\"To The Floor\\". The slower songs are alright like \\"Mine Again\\", & \\"Joy Ride\\"; \\"Circles\\" is probably the best slow/love song on the disc. <br /> <br />Like I said, I'm not a huge Mariah fan, but maybe that's why I like this album, it seems a little different from what we've all heard in the past.  I like the different influences throughout the CD that can be heard.   <br />It's worth it.
0723247609|5.0|When your child is getting too old for picture books, but hasn't quite the patience for chapter books, these stories are absolutely brilliant for this in-between stage. <br /> <br />With such beautiful pictures, supurb narrative and intriguing ideas, it's little wonder my 4 and 7 year old girls are captivated by these stories.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Director Tim Burton has never really made a film quite this sentimental before and after seeing Big Fish he was long overdue. This film is a very touching and enchanting tale about a father and son trying to mend their paths. Ewan Mcgregor is very impressive in this movie, he just seems to shine with optimistic purity. Albert Finney as the same character in the dusk of his years is equally affecting. The only weak link is Billy Crudup who is very wooden and dry, but the film works nonetheless. There is a magic in Burton's best works, and Big Fish is definatly one of these. Even if your not a regular Burton fan check it out, it may surprise you. If you are a Burton fan and haven't seen it then what's your excuse?
0375707972|3.0|The above reviews have summarized the plot effectively, so I only want to add a few points about the narrative strategy.  The text is masterly, that is to say honed to hit all the lines between incidental decision-making and actual issues of morality.  His story is plausible in a Talmudic sense only, otherwise all the details have been carefully chosen so as to lead the reader into conclusions that ultimately alleviate German responsibility.  Its true that sometimes we make big decisions, really big decisions based on irrelevant data points, but the author is not being fair in presenting all of the material only from that perspective.
B000089CJI|5.0|Good album, something I pop in every once  <br />in a while when i'm in a mellow mood. <br />Why doen't anyone give some credit to Jenny <br />Lewis, her beautiful voice is on this cd a lot <br />and i'm very greatful it is. <br />Not for everyone, but it's worth a spin.
B00005JNEI|5.0|One rarely sees a movie or documentary that answers age old questions but Michael Moore's \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" does.  It tells us in no uncertain terms why war exists.  If anyone wants to keep someone from enlisting in the military, just be sure the potential enlistee views this documentary first.  All such \\"patriotic\\" notions will instantly disappear when they learn how cynically they are being used and killed, how for many hundreds of years they have been, like so much meat.  This is an amazing documentary, one everyone should see, required viewing by every high school junior (that would be the day!).  I can understand why it has won so many awards, including Best Picture in Cannes in 2004!  This is the first time a documentary has ever won Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival.  See this documentary.  You owe it to yourself.  You owe it to your fellow Americans.  You owe it to mankind.  See ALL of it...........and take it from there.  You are needed.
0790729369|5.0|This is a very touching movie that paces itself and eases it's characters into your mind and eventually your heart. This is a story about longing and desire. The acting is top notch by both leads, the romance very believable, and the story has every facet of the human experience. A beautifully told tale, and beautifully shot as well. The final scene is one of the most memorable scenes in recent film history, there are some very powerful moments here if you will pay attention and are not quick to judge this movie as many are. This is a real story with real characters not some contrived hollywood fluff.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|This is definetly one of the best AC/DC albums.  It is basically a compilation of the \\"best\\" songs from their first two Australian albums.  Every song on here is excellent. <br /> <br />1. It's A Long Way To the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)-5/5.  Simply one of the best rock songs ever.  Heavy riffing, great Bon Scott vocals and a bagpipe solo.  It actually fits the song very well.  The best song on the album. <br />2. Rock 'n' Roll Singer-4/5.  Another great guitar riff with great Bon Scott vocals.  AC/DC were always at their best when their songs were about the rock lifestyle. <br />3. The Jack-5/5.  Very bluesy, slow song about being with a woman who has an STD.  As disgusting as it may sound, the lyrics actually describe it as a card game.  Very witty.  One of the best songs on here. <br />4. Live Wire-4/5.  A little slower and a lot less raw than the rest of the album.  The lyrics and vocal delivery make up for the lack of raw power.   <br />5. T.N.T.-4/5.  This song is pure attitude.  Very heavy beat that keeps your head bobbing.  Another great vocal performance from Bon Scott. <br />6. Can I Sit Next To You Girl-4/5.  Very upbeat with a bit of a dancy feel, in a rock 'n' roll way!!  Cool, sexually charged lyrics.  AC/DC are very good at this type of song. <br />7. Little Lover-5/5.  Another bluesy number with great guitar playing.  Lyrically, it's about spending a little \\"quality time\\" with an underage groupie.  Great vocals from Scott. <br />8. She's Got Balls-4/5.  This is probably my least favorite song on the album.  It still has a classic title and excellent lyrics with a great vocal.  A little less raw than the other songs. <br />9. High Voltage-5/5.  Another great raw energy and attitude track.  Upbeat and exciting.  Another excellent song with great rock 'n' roll lyrics and a great vocal delivery. <br /> <br />This album is full of excellent songs where even the weaker ones are on par with the best of AC/DC's 1980's hits.  Bon Scott had a vocal style and energy that, with all due respect, Brian Johnson just doesn't have.  This is one of their absolute best albums.
B00005JNEI|3.0|So instead of talking about \\"Bush won, get over it!\\" and \\"Michael Moore is fat!\\" lets talk about the structure of the movie. Ok? Good. <br /> <br />The movie starts out in the lull and disbelief of the election in 2000, which is somewhat comical and points out the problems of both Gore and Bush and their tastes in recreation/celebrities/music. Then, we talk about pre-9/11 Bush, and the stupid things he did (or didn't do, who knows.) <br /> <br />Finally, we hit it. Yes, it's tastefully done, no it's not used against Bush in any way. <br /> <br />The following movie is a chocolate/vanilla swirl of a movie, both pointing out the paranoia of the Patriot Act, expoliting the poor, and Bush's friends, the Saudis! Weeee! <br /> <br />In the end, it does the movie accomplishes two things, it shows that in a rush and fit of anger, Michale Moore, the guy who did The Awful Truth and Bowling for Colombine, two of my favorite works, can get sloppy, and it also shows that the movie is mostly hype. For those looking for a smoking gun, you'll find some stuff, but it's mostly biased and can be shot down or scaled back. <br /> <br />At best a good rental.
B000002UB3|5.0|Well what can be said about this album that hasn't been already stated.  From the cover with the Fab 4 walking the zebra crossing to the EMI studios..to the music inside, this is an album that if you haven't got it...get it!  Not long after this album they split up going their separate and creative ways. This was the last album to be recorded, apparently \\"Let It Be\\" was the last to be released.
0792844882|2.0|The People that like this movie are mainly pervs who love T&A even if there is any point to it or not, my advice go rent a porno. This movie is a fun time for the absolute 100% disaster of it all. The acting is B movie grade, and that even includes Kyle Mchlachlan slumming here(David Lynch come and save him). The story is paper thin and silly, laughably so in fact. This movie received notice only because it was rated NC-17, which is the main reason I have a loathing for this film. True sincere films that also got hit with this rating suffer from the impression that they like this one are simply brain dead gratuitious trash. Movies about strippers and dancers always suck, it's just the way it is. Striptease was even worse than this one, with the exception of Burt Reynolds. Watch this movie only for a good laugh, it's all that it's worth.
B00008WT5C|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is, by far, AC/DC's best album.  It is rawer, faster, heavier, nastier and more brutal than \\"High Voltage\\" or any other album by them, and I'm sure that, at the time, not too many thought that was possible. <br /> <br />1. Go Down-5/5.  Excellent upbeat, hard driving song with very sexually charged lyrics.  You can almost imagine Bon Scott saying these things to the women he would meet.  This song has a driving beat that doesn't let up. <br />2. Dog Eat Dog-5/5.  Another great, heavy, upbeat song.  The lyrics are one of Bon Scott's best and actually had something to say besides his typical rock 'n' roll lyrics.  One of the best. <br />3. Let There Be Rock-5/5.  Another signature AC/DC song.  The lyrics to this are the best ever for AC/DC.  Although this song is long, it never wears you down because the fast beat never slows down.  One of their best ever. <br />4. Bad Boy Boogie-4/5.  A little bluesy, with a bit of a dancy feel to it.  One of the weaker songs on here, but still great. <br />5. Problem Child-3/5.  This is one of my least favorite songs ever by AC/DC.  I wish that \\"Crabsody In Blue\\" would have been put on here instead as it was on the Australian release.  It's just a bit too long and a little boring. <br />6. Overdose-4/5.  Heavy riffing with an excellent vocal delivery from Bon Scott.  Hard driving rocker, if a bit too long. <br />7. Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be-5/5.  Another fantastic heavy rocker.  Hard driving and full of attitude.  One of the best on the album. <br />8. Whole Lotta Rosie-5/5.  My personal favorite AC/DC song ever.  This song is fast and furious, nasty and sexy, driving and relentless.  This has AC/DC's best guitar riff and Bon Scott's best vocal delivery.  Absolutely perfect! <br /> <br />This is the most furious, raw and heavy album that AC/DC ever created.  The songs definetly live up to the great title.  I consider this one of rock's greatest albums ever, whether you are an AC/DC fan or not.
B0002OERI0|5.0|To say this album is anti-war, or even anti-Bush or anti-American, is like saying the Travel Channel is all about poker because that's the #1 show. Yes, some people will not like this album because of some anti-war material (the two songs that are), but to say the buck to stops there is insane. What Green Day has done is produce an album about rebelion and finding yourself, and yes, it happens that part of this rebelion is anti-war.    For those who want to read beyond \\"Green Day sux majors\\" or \\"this isn't punk!!1!\\", here is the real story. The album details an individual who leaves his home in a fit of disgust to roam around the city, which is supposed to be the cure of his problems. He finds it lonesome, and developes a persona to use, inwhich he finds the perfect girl. Don't want to spoil the ending, but it's good. If you care about story and music, get this album, you WILL NOT be disapointed!
B000002UAU|4.0|The lionization of the Beatles as musical artists (no longer just head-shaking, ululating teen icons) that began with the string-quartet arrangement of \\"Yesterday\\" reached its absolute zenith with the June, 1967 release of this dramatically sheathed slab of plastic. <br /> <br />\\"WHY, THIS IS CAPITAL 'A' ART!\\" people were writing.  <br /> <br />The Beatles had gone and applied thematic unity, music concrete, the raga, societal commentary, really clever packaging and much, much more to their post-Dylan, post-Mersey worldview-with-a-backbeat. <br /> <br />Breathlessly it was whispered that the Fabs had used 24-Track recording equipment(!!) This record was such a studio product that No One would ever be able to play it on stage. (This was rumored to be the reason why the boys would never tour again. And, it was all about ACID and the HIPPIES. It was the biggest thing in pop music since, well since the Beatles themselves appeared in the US in 1964. It was the Beatles all over again! <br /> <br />The album followed on the heels of the \\"Penny Lane / Strawberry Fields Forever\\" single, a sonic statement which stood the pop music world on its collective ear. Early reports on Sgt Pepper were that it was \\"even more psychedelic!\\" NO! I CAN'T IMAGINE IT! <br /> <br />I was 16 and I drove down to EJ Korvette and bought the vinyl album to hear for myself.  <br /> <br />It was actually, I thought, bigger than the Beatles. It opened worlds of thought and speculation previously inaccessible to me. It was enormous, contagious, dynamic, endless and it still is. The Fabs had time and dimension warped everything with this big black disk. You can't really reconstruct what that felt like at this far remove (2005).  <br /> <br />Then I listened to the second record I purchased that day: \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\", by Jefferson Airplane. I knew something was going on, but I didn't know what it was, exactly. It was one of those days you never forget.
0783226063|4.0|I like this movie a lot, it is visually arresting and the acting is very good. I've never read the book and don't really care how it compares, movies aren't books so I don't know why people compare them so often. This movie creates a new world that sucks the viewer in. I do wonder at times though if David Lynch ever regrets turning down Return of the Jedi to do this movie. Quality sci-fi and great storytelling delivered in a stunning package of sight and sound.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I love Alicia and this cd. To me it was alot better than her first. Her vocals are incredible and beats go great with the music. Alicia has all the class and talent of what a true R&B diva should be. If you want a touch of real music, then you need to add this to your collection. I feel Miss Keys has a long time coming, in the industry.

B00004W50T|5.0|This album came at a time of crisis in this country and held great personal meaning to me.  Although very good work, it was not really a commercial song album.  It didn't fit the cookie cutter profile of successful pop tunes, which of course made it all the more desirable to me.  After all, this was a time of going against the grain, a time of protest against the already established mass conglomerate majority that created the chaos. <br /> <br />24 bit digital remaster means \\"buy on site to me\\".  I have always been very pleased with this format and the Big Pink continues to please well into the 21st century.  All of the instruments and voices can be heard standing out and yet blend together well at the same time achieving a great balance for an overall excellent sound.   <br /> <br />I can just picture in my mind these guys living way out in the country dreaming up creative new musical ideas.  I don't think I have ever heard anybody use horns that way with a rock band.  Robbie Robertson teaches his guitar how to cry (Tears of Rage) through what sounds like a spinning Whurlitzer leslie speaker system. Very cool.       <br /> <br />The Weight - A version of this great sounding song was featured in the movie Easy Rider and it often reminds me of life in the sixties.  To me, the Weight meant that people want to kill you because you have long hair, listen to rock and roll music, or protest the Vietnam war.  I ran into lots of moronic people like that in the sixties.  There were people all over America that resembled all too much the idiots who killed Captain America and his friends in Easy Rider. At the tender age of 18, I realized that the world was not a friendly place.  I would have to join the march on Washington D.C. to protest the Vietnam war in order to stop the killing, and no one would thank me for it.  In fact I would be hated for it.  That was the weight to me and on me.  So march we did along with millions of other Americans, and it was worth it.  We stoppedthat Vietnam war and the senseless killing of Americans ( 500 Americans were being killed per week).  We ended the draft and got the voting age lowered to 18.  And so for awhile that weight was lifted and the world became a better place.  What was a very sad song became a happy one.  Always remember, if you want to get something done, the weight is on you.         <br /> <br />Chest fever - Many of my relatives are musicians and they always gave me a hard time about rock and roll.  \\"It's only three chords\\", would be the complaint.  Chest fever starts out with something that sounds like Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, and then effortlessly blends and melts into a slow, smooth, really cool, rock beat.    This song proved to me that Rock and Roll could be something more than just three chords and all the nay sayers would have to find some other complaint.   <br /> <br />Tears of Rage - Martin Luther King was shot.  Bobby Kennedy was shot.  George Mcgovern, the peace candidate, was defeated.  The Vietnam war raged on like an out of control forest fire. Every time it looked like someone was going to lead us all out of the fire, they were shot or killed, or voted down with dirty tricks.   And so, tears of rage, a slow mournful song with everyone continually coming in late.  At times it drags and complains like a funeral procession but always with compassion and empathy.     <br /> <br />Long Black Veil - This is a creepy song from the grave that I have tried hard to forget but it is so creepy it is hard to forget entirely.  Yes it is creative and yes I really wish they had left this song off the album.  While this song succeeds lyrically and musically, it is just too creepy for me.  Gives me nightmares. <br />  <br />Overall - a five star album and a five star CD.  You didn't hear any of this on top 40 radio and that's another reason why I liked it.  It was part of the other movement.  Very good for those lazy days when you want to take your mind somewhere else.  Just look at the album cover.  People clowning around reaching over the piano to play it balancing a plant on their head.  Are these guys somewhere else or what ?  Warning:  As in my case, it may make you want to pick up your guitar or turn on your piano.  Enjoy !     <br />
B00004U8JV|1.0|This is one of the worst sequels ever made and released to the general public, this one should have been sent back and redone. What a bunch of junk. The characters in this movie are loud, stupid, and generally all unlikable, so when they get eaten the audience rejoices as if it were the second coming. This movie offers nothing new from the original really, more dinosuars and sillier people that's about it. There is nothing suspenseful or exciting here. The magical sight of the dinosaur effects has lost it's luster and even good actors have to hang their heads in shame after this one.Everybody has a bad movie on their resume, but Mr. Speilberg has to take credit for this one...poor guy.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Now then this is one of the huge and popular bands out there that still has a side of uniqueness. I have been a hardcore System Of A Down for nearly 5 years when I first saw them on Late night with Conan O'Brien, before that I have never heard of these guys and I have been following them ever since and I must say with every album they bring a different feel and musical style. For example Steal This Album if you want to call it an album had some great lyrics, great guitar work, great lyrics, and some great drumming even though Shavo is not the bassist I still love what he brings to the music. Toxicity is yet another great album they changed a lot from there subtitled debut to that and that is where I thought these guys if they keep doing what they are doing they will be huge and little did I know they did and still after a 4 year break between albums I thought it was defiantly worth the wait, but during that time I think it was smart of them to take a break between the two because they have grown to become one of the largest bands in the United States if not the world.  <br /> <br />Anyway enough about the history of the band. Mesmerize is a great album even though most fans of System Of A Down hate this album because it's not Toxicity. What I have to say to this is that System Of A Down is a band that always tries to still push the boundaries of mainstream music each album, and Toxicity is a great album and same with there self title debut and Steal This Album (as I said before if you want call it that.) Also, Mesmerize has more of a Speed Metal/Thrasher feel to it on most songs. My favorite songs are well all of them because they all bring a different feel like \\"Revenga\\" has a fast speed metal guitar riff inside of it while \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is one of the slowest songs System Of A Down has ever done other than the acoustic song Roulette off of Steal This Album. Furthermore, what is different about this album is that Daron (the guitarist) sings a lot more thanany other albums before he is there and sings back up on this album they both sing equally almost half and half. Also if you are looking to buy this album and you have not liked System Of A Down that long I don't know if you'll like it well because as I said prior with each album they have a different vibe and that is why I love them. For a fan that has liked that since Toxicity and you think that is there best album move on and love that System Of A Down is an evolving band not like most of the music out there that is mainstream. <br /> <br />Lastly, I cannot wait till Hypnotize comes out sometime in November or early December. So when that comes out show your support and buy this one and that one.     <br />
0380789035|4.0|Its a very unique book, with a storyline balancing paranormal weirdness with all-too-normal weirdness. Highly readable, if not a definite classic for the ages. I won't go in detail, that's what the other 400 reviews seem to be for (Note to potential reviewers: these aren't book reports. Spoilers suck).<br /><br />Nevertheless, I must admit the parallels to Douglas Adam's \\"Long Dark Teatime of the Soul\\" struck me early. Nevertheless, where that was a comedic take on a similar theme, this work is far more surreal and a little more dark, and both have a deep consideration for the subject at hand.

B0002XNT0I|5.0|Tom Hanks came out of left field in this one and blew everybody away. He simply takes your breath away in this movie, he is an actor in total command of everything he does, every slight nuance matters and Hanks is nearly singular in his craft, he can pin point and hit every note just right. The story was a very timely and important one, and still is. This film like Schindler's List is one that is necessary to see, films like this put us in others shoes and give us a glimpse of the suffering those around have and are going through. In our selfish age films like this stand lit up like a beacon of hope.
B000002USN|5.0|Had this on tape and lost it. When Luther Vandross died it prompted me to look for it again. The opening track with Big Frank is two quality voices harmonising brilliantly. This CD is a must for all Frank Sinatra fans who want to hear variations of original masters. From Bono to Charles Aznavour this is a vey good listen. Only moan is its all over too quickly. Could have done with some more tracks. Be warned don't get the follow on Duets album. That ones a Dodo. DC
B0000524CY|5.0|No matter where you go and who you ask, this movie will always be mention as the most scariest movie ever.  To achieve that status, this movie still scare people from different generations in forms of shock value and visual extremes, from the first theater showing to the DVD in DVD player.<br /><br />The movie was made in the 70's, giving the old and classic look to this movie.  Some scenes of the movie are shown in the day time, but the rest of the movie is dark and murky looking, with the fog and the coldness.  The cast for the characters are great, especially Linda Blair, who was around 11 or 12 years old when she played the role of the demon possessed child Reagan.  Her acting really excels in this performance, some might think her acting might be too extreme and vulgar for a young girl.<br /><br />This version is different from the orignal theatrical release, some scenes are added.  The most memorable and horrific scene added is the \\"spider walk\\" down the stairs.  That scene is chilling and spooking, thinking how is that possible.  Reagan do not even look human, which makes that scene terrorfying.<br /><br />Overall the success of this movie is the reality of the story.  This event is based on actual experiences, written as a novel, and later adapted to the movie.  This is the most scariest movie ever and if you have never seen this movie, you have to because it will never go away.
0140364536|5.0|When I went off for my first semester of college my father gave me $100 with which to buy textbooks, which certainly dates me. After buying everything for my classes I had enough money left over to buy a hard cover copy of \\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams for $6.95, which for people who love books is certainly a great way of representing the ravages of inflation over the years. I decided to read a chapter of \\"Watership Down\\" each night before going to bed, thereby marking the beginning of my obsession with reading a chapter of something each day that has nothing to do with school. When my dorm roommate became as hooked on the story as much as I was he and I would read chapters aloud. Fifty days I got to the book's epilogue with the same sort of sadness that it was all over that I experienced getting to the end of the \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy.<br /><br />Living in the Sandleford Warren with its Chief Rabbit and Owsla maintaining a comfortable social order, Hazel and his little brother Fiver are content enough. But Fiver has the gift of prophecy, and when he warns that the warren has to be abandoned right away or they are all going to die, Hazel and a small circle of friends believe him and leave despite the fact that have no idea where they are going. Fiver envisions a great high place where they can be happy and safe, but there are a series of imposing obstacles to overcome, from not only humans and predators, but other wild rabbits as well. Consequently the basic story of \\"Watership Down\\" is the ancient quest for home, although in this case it is a new home that represents a wild rabbit's idea of utopia.<br /><br />The greatness of \\"Watership Down\\" rests on the sense of realism that Adams brings to his story wild rabbits. Adams studied Lapine life in R. M. Lockley's \\"The Private Life of the Rabbit\\" in order to keep his rabbits real. But beyond the way rabbits live in nature Adams provides them with a history and a culture, represented not only in the stories they tell of El-ahrairah (the Prince with a Thousand Enemies), but their beliefs in Frith the lord sun, and their simple games such as bob-stones. When confronted with sticky situations they are able to use their ingenuity to come up with surprising solutions that are still within the realm of possibility for real rabbits. I always liked the way Hazel, Blackberry and the others have to work out these puzzles, straining for a leap of intuition and cognitive insight that seems just beyond the reach of their relatively simple minds. So while these rabbits are capable of doing more than others of their kind, Adams keeps their efforts remarkable rather than magical.<br /><br />We also pick up a few choice words from the language of the rabbits (e.g., \\"silflay\\" is to go above ground to feed, \\"homba is a fox), which ends up paying off with one of my favorite moments in the book when Bigway utters a simple but effective curse. The lesson of the story is clearly that bigger does not mean better, for Hazel is neither the strongest nor the smartest of the rabbits that he leads, but he had the best qualities of leadership. Each of the rabbits that join Hazel on the quest to find Watership Down and build a new life there offers something to the ground, and the distinctive personalities that Adams creates for each of them adds to the novel as well.<br /><br />Of all the books that I have that I like to pick up from time to time and read again my favorite parts, \\"Watership Down\\" is the oldest. As a children's story is it simply one that is too good for most children, but without the deep allegorical elements that afflict so many other great children's stories. Perhaps that is why this novel has become so beloved, because it speaks to the child in all of us and the simple virtues that we all want the world to embody.

0790729342|5.0|This is probably the second best action film ever made, right after Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is the best of the Mad Max films. The movie is slow paced yet very effective in building tension and directed to absolute perfection. The villians are some of the most memorable coloful villians you will ever see on the screen. Although I'm not a big Mel Gibson fan, this is the only type of role that suits him, quiet and gruff. A classic film with some breathless scenes that demand to be rewatched time and time again.

0783227434|5.0|The third installment of the Evil Dead series, yet the title is not Evil Dead 3.<br /><br />Bruce Cambell, who plays Ash, is warped from his job at the local depatment store to the past, and finds himself in a rustic village and at the hands of the evil that haunts that village.  Ash later wins over the people of the village and their cross town rivals to defeat the Army of Darkness, a band of skeletons and zombies.<br /><br />This movie I find very entertaining, funny and sometimes weird.  I like the skeletons, just because they were not computer generated, which gives a old school look.<br /><br />Great movie to end the Evil Dead series, and in the words of Ash, \\"GROOVY!\\".

I watch this movie back to back. I told my male associate that this a must see movie. And he Agreed.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Quentin Tarantino delivers his most energetic and fastest moving film to date, and it works like few movies do, part camp, part martial arts flick, part underground indie, and some comedy thrown in for good measure. This is an original and inspired stew. Uma Thurman seems to do her best work with Tarantino, she was equally good in Pulp Fiction. The first volume moves quicker than the second but both are great. Treat yourself to Kill Bill.
6305841861|5.0|This is the second of the Evil Dead series, starring Bruce Cambell.  This movie is funnier than the first Evil Dead, yet still has the element of the first one to bring you the same horror experience, again same gore and horror, and camera techniques.  Overall great classic horror movie for all you horror movie fans,  and I personally I like the older horror movie more than the modern ones.
B00005JLWN|4.0|This film is fueled with Orwellian ideas and action scenes that make Keanu Reeves weep. A very intriguing take on a totalitarian government forcing it's citizens to supress their emotions. Christian Bale is impressive in this movie as he usually is. This movie didn't get a lot of press but it is well worth a watch. This movie is a surprise gem.
B00005RYLE|5.0|If there is a list for the most scariest movie ever, this one is on my list.  This movie is very old, low budget, cult status looking, which makes the movie work.  The cast makes the whole movie work also, especially Bruce Cambell, star of all the Evil Dead series.  Probably the most recognizable part of the Evil Dead series is the first person perspective of the demon chasing after someone or running towards the house, very cool looking.<br /><br />The movie is about a group of friends going out to a cabin in the woods to have fun, but they do not know about the evil living there.  As day turn to night, one of the girls get possessed and turns into a demon, the rest of the group have to stay together and fight the evil. Death by dawn, death by dawn.<br /><br />Overall, a classic horror movie, not the most special in effects or acting, yet delivers a shocking and weird taste of Sam Raimi.
B00012QM8G|5.0|One of the all time great films. A powerhouse film experience heightened by Liam Neeson's excellent portayal of the title charcter. Ralph Fiennes raises goosebumps as a heartless German soldier in an equally effective performance. One of the most important films ever made.
B000A6T1KE|1.0|Posably the worst star trek movie of all time. story sucked and was totaly NOT balievable. when i got to the end of the movie i was almost screaming b**l s**t, and to give me money back. if your looking for  a good star trek movie, watch/re-watch star trek 2 the wrath of khan.
B0009HLDFU|3.0|All the reviews you've read are true.  This is some great music.  I especially love the first (hard) disk, even though it rocks significantly harder than I normally listen to.  There will be many hits from this one. <br /> <br />Copy protection sucks.  I will find a way to break it - probably by using software/hardware I already have - and copy it LEGALLY for my own use.  Wake up record companies!  I am this close to going 100% MP3, as are many others.  I've already ripped my entire CD collection and am $90 worth of hardware from replacing my CD player on my home stereo with a MP3 player that will read my entire lirary from my computer's hard disk.  This may be one of the last CDs I buy and good riddance!
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I saw this band play at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago a few weeks ago and was totally blown away.  It was one of the most energetic, entertaining and passionate live performances I had seen in a long long time.  Before the festival, I didn't own the album and had never heard any of their songs.  After hearing them live, I went out and bought Funeral the next day.  The studio album certainly doesn't disappoint and contains a nice mix of mellow and fast paced songs.  Definitely a highly recommended album, but seeing them live will make you appreciate it even more.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It took me about two listens to get totally hooked on this album.  It is in the same vein as their two previous releases with the addition of more expansive instrumentation and mixes.  This is a some brilliant song-writing - smart pop at its best.  All I can say is this album is on the edge of my mind about every waking hour of the day since I first heard it.  Very catchy.
B0009S4IHY|3.0|That's all i can say about this movie.  After watching \\"Shaolin Soccer\\", despite the over-the-top special effects, the cheesiness, and other nuisances, I enjoyed the film quite a bit.  That would be because the characters were interesting, it was really funny, and I cared about the characters.  I can't say that I feel the same way after watching \\"Kung Fu Hustle.\\"  This movie had its moments, but overall I think that it was quite lacking.  The story could have been great, but they didn't do much with it.  I wished that they had done more with the Axe Gang, other than making them targets of the super-powered heroes.  Also, there was very little Kung Fu or Hustle in Kung Fu Hustle.  Firstly, there was only one scene of the axe gang and its leader dancing after a killing, and it was funny.  There is little actual Kung Fu, and I think that Steven Chow's idol Bruce Lee would be very disappointed by this film.  He relies too much on wire work a la The Matrix, giving the characters the powers making it uneccesary  to use much Kung fu.  I've seem more realistic fights in a Dragon Ball episode.  Also, the special effects seem a little bit messy, and aren't up to the quality you would see in a lot of hollywood films.  A lot of old Kung fu geniuses in the 60s and 70s did a lot more with a lot less in making an effective martial arts movie.  I expected better from you Stephen Chow.  This movie is probably worth renting, but i wouldn't suggest buying it.
B00005ASOI|2.0|It obvious that Argento and co. have created a visually and aurally impressive film, however I can't but help feel that other aspects such as characterisation and plot are somewhat limp.
B0007M22TI|4.0|THE DVD IS MUCH LIKE THE CD OF THE SAME NAME <br />MAREAD NESBITT IS A GREAT FIDDLE PLAYER THEY SHOULD HAVE UTILIZED HER TALENTS MORE> MORE REELS AND JIGS> <br /> <br />
0345440900|1.0|I drove myself crazy trying to follow the guidelines in this book and I think that trying to implement these with my son actually caused him to have sleep problems.  I think the suggestions in this book, especially regarding putting the baby to sleep, are too rigid and don't give you enough options for when the suggestions aren't working.  I found Dr. Sear's The Baby Book, and Elizabeth Pantley's No Cry Sleep Solution to be more helpful.

B000055ZB8|5.0|Nosferatu eine Symphonie des Grauens has always been one of my favorite movies.  I actually have two copies one on VHS and the other on DVD.  Of the two I prefer the music on the VHS, although it's rather churchy sounding, it seemed appropriate for the story.  Max Shreck was subtle in his performance and his appearance seemed to get more and more disturbing as the movie went on.  With most movies you get adjusted to the creature's features, not this one.  One thing I like about the movie is how it sticks in one's memory, and continues to bother one for days afterwards, because it's more visual than visceral.  The only special effect was Graff Orlock's disappearance in a puff of smoke at the conclusion.  Very few movies have this retention effect.  I've only had it from four other movies: Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Roman Polanski's Repulsion and Macbeth, and the Nicole Kidman's The Others.  Nosferatu stripped the book Dracula to the bone and almost succeeded in making a totally seperate vampire story.  Even Gustav von Wagenheim's exaggerrated performance seemed dead on, even when he was pulling the covers over his head and cowering.  The early lovey-dovey scenes with his wife Ellen were a little sticky sweet though. Greta Schroder was even more the Victorian Angel in the House than Mina in the novel Dracula.  The character in the novel showed a lot of backbone and thoughtfulness. Schroder's long-suffering demeanor did grow tiresome after awhile though.  A funny thing was that in some scenes Schroder's reminded me of Susan St. James.  Maybe that's why the latter was casted in Love At First Bite. I'm inclined to doubt it, although I understand that's why Roman Polanski casted himself in The Fearless Vampire Hunter's, because of his resembelance to von Waggenheim.  The shadows of the movie were interesting in portending doom, but now days I have to admit it makes me think of the Simpson's take-off of the mediocre Bram Stoker's Dracula.  The shadows of the vampire were contrary to Stoker's book, but perhaps not to all legends.  I also could have done without the extended chase scene after the insane Knock, played by Alexander Granach.
0141301155|5.0|Dahl continues to amaze me as I revisit his classics in my adulthood.  How is it that he writes so perfectly for his adolescent audience and still gains much praise from adults?  I, like many others, read this in preparation for the theatrical release, and it was a fantastic book!   <br /> <br />During Wonka's hunt for the best heir to his factory, the audience comes to see four of the children as monstrous and responsible for their horrible words and actions.  I like that Dahl kills the innocent childhood image (aside from his depiction of Charlie).  And instead of merely inflicting punishments, he actually seems to \\"allow\\" the children to fall into their own unique demises.  Charlie triumphs in the end because he isn't extraordinary--he's simple, content, and happy just to be there. <br /> <br />Written with wit and on-point language, Dahl dazzles his audience with this quick read.
B0000026T4|3.0|Follow-up to his metal-like effort 'Raise Your Fist And Yell' lp (see my review). Only complaint I might have about 'Trash' is that it appears to be a bit too commercial. However, he must've done something right because this CD turned out to be his first REAL successful album in years. Maybe it's because he ended up hooking up with ace producer Desmond Child. The music is good,sometimes I just sort of wish it could've been a little heavier. Cuts I thought were happening include the MTV favorite (even to this day) \\"Poison\\", \\"House Of Fire\\", \\"Bed Of Nails\\", the title track \\"Trash\\" and \\"Hell Is Living With You\\"( Sam Kinison's theme song, perhaps?) that was co-written by Cooper, Child and Jon Bon Jovi. Check it out.
006097625X|5.0|No kidding.  Reading this book, and re-reading, and re-re-reading it, changed the way I'll think of comics, storytelling, and art in life forever!      Anyone interested in art as a career has something to gain from this book.  Even if you somehow already know and embrace all of the ideas presented in this book, you'll walk away better able to present your ideas to others.    I got the chance to meet the author, scott mccloud, recently at my university where he was giving a seminar.  This guy is amazing, someone I might follow around to learn more if I had nothing else to do - like Socrates and his followers in his time.    Beyond the content, the book itself is a masterpiece, using comics as a medium to explain what no other medium can acheive, exploiting comics' unique strengths and quirks.  It's an easy, yet deep read all the way through (hence it's very easy to pick up and re-read from the beginning).    This belongs on the shelf of all storytellers using any media, be it comics, film, novels, or oratory.    All this said, if you want a book AFTER this that focuses a bit more on the comic industry, McCloud's Understanding Comics sequel is another must buy: Reinventing Comics.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|This movie is incredible.  I loved \\"The Bourne Identity\\"  but this sequel runs circles   around the first one.  Damon is on point, once again,  and he's supported by an A-list  cast of superb actors. When  Bourne moves, everyone moves with him,  creating an action pack powerhouse   of a movie. I've watched this movie  so many times, I wouldn't be surprised if  one day my name suddenly appeared in the closing credits.   The action scenes are astounding  and the auto chase scene near the  end is definitely one for the cinema  history books.  Buy this movie!  It's everything it's hyped to be,  and beyond.
B0002S94OS|5.0|By far one of the best hardcore/thrash/whatever you want to call it CDs released in recent history.  The recording quality is much better than their previous albums.  It has everything I want in a metal album:  Heavy riffs, thundering double bass, and growls and screams that will terrify the elderly.  The ability of these guys is amazing.  I couldn't ask for anything more.
0671042858|5.0|\\"The girl who loved Tom Gordon\\" by Stephan king is a wonderful young readers book. This story is about one girl who visited a camp on her vacation with her family. The girl name is Trisha, she is 10 years old. She has only one older brother Pete. They live with her mother because their father left when they were young. Pete is a good brother and best friend. Always he helps Trisha and encourages her. But her mother and Pet have bad relationships because they don't respect and understand each other.<br /><br />That's the big reason, why she left the camp alone to go to woods.<br /><br />  When she lost in the woods, she only believed Tom Gordon. The tom Gordon is a real person, who does indeed pitch in the closers role for the Boston Red Sox, but the Gordon in this story is fictional.<br /><br />  Trisha and her father used to watch Red Sox's game when she was very young. She loves base ball players specially Tom Gordon. When she lost in dark woods, she had only one thing is her Walkman. She turned on her walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red sox baseball game. When the walkman worked, Trisha imagined that Tom Gordon was with her and protecting her from all the real enemies. Finally she found the right direction and survived 7 days with her imaginary hero Tom Gordon.<br /><br />  There is one story about one family lost on deserted island. They had to survive one month without enough food. Obviously it was impossible to do it but they survived and find the right way to get out the deserted island.  This story sounds very fictional but it based on true story. The Trisha's story is fictional but it seems non fictional because in this story the impossible things become possible. If we compare these two stories, we will see one same thing. The main point is to believe your own power, and then you can find right direction.<br /><br />  There is much kind of horror books in the store but they have same types.<br /><br />If you read this story, you will see very deep relationship between real person and imaginary person.  This is very delightful story, and I enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />  I think this book tells us too many things about human rights. And the book gave me a good advice.  If her mother understands her children feelings, she would understand what they want.  It showed us the woods are real. If we visit them on our vacation, bring a compass, bring good maps or try to stay on the camp.ry deep relationship between real person and imaginary person.

B0002KPHXS|5.0|This short (just 70 minutes), tender romance retains a special purity. Bergman, who played the same role in a Swedish version, is breathtaking, while Howard exudes the old world charm of a classic British gentleman. Their subtly intense interactions are punctuated by some very lovely music. All in all, romance with a capital \\"R.\\"
B000002H33|5.0|Let's not beat around the bush here. \\"Master\\" is, if not THE finest all time heavy metal album, at least tied for first place with a handful of other classics such as \\"Piece of Mind\\" and \\"Paranoid\\". Even the holiest of Priest relics (ie. \\"British Steel\\") are padded with at least a few songs' worth of filler, something \\"Master of Puppets\\" is never guilty of. It's rather incredible that the weakest song on the album is probably \\"Damage Inc\\", yet that song is nonetheless a stone cold classic in the Metallica canon to this day, having highlighted many a setlist over the years. <br />Opening track \\"Battery\\" set a new standard of brutality for the band, a traditional thrash standard the likes of which used to be a mainstay on track one, side one of every Metallica album back in the day. The title track remains in the top five of the band's catalog, a kinetic paean to substance abuse which bears far more heft than anything James Hetfield has penned since getting out of rehab. Lyrically, \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\" treads shallow water, but conceptually and thematically it's one of the most musically realized pieces on the record. <br /> <br />Side two is chock full of unheralded Metallica classics, or at least as chock full as an eight track album can get. No doubt token instrumental \\"Orion\\" hasn't become a live staple a la \\"Call of Ktulu (sic)\\" due to it's laid back, dreamlike quality, but in my opinion this is one of the primary reasons Metallica have fallen off the right track over the years: they seem to have progressively (regressively?) got to the point where they don't want to bother writing anything that won't \\"kick ass!\\" live, which ends up making their studio albums increasingly one dimensional. \\"Orion\\" is a curious anomaly in Metallica's repertoire, but a brilliant one, and it's a shame they've so seldom explored this direction on subsequent efforts. <br /> <br />Side two also contains \\"Disposable Heroes\\", an anti-war sequel to \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\", and\\"Leper Messiah\\", which is named after a line in David Bowie's \\"Suffragette City\\" and I believe concerns the hypnotic cult-like appeal of pop icon Oprah Winfrey (kidding). Wrapping it up is the aforementioned \\"Damage Inc.\\", an unapologetic stomper which concludes the album with all the ferocious veracity with which it began. <br /> <br />So what we're left with nearly twenty years later is a seminal album the likes of which have never been surpassed or duplicated, even by Metallica themselves. They'd come close to this level of achievement with their next record (\\"And Justice For All\\"), despite the loss of Cliff Burton, but once the 90s arrived the new decade found the band trailing off into entirely different tangents, none of which were as convincingly brilliant as their work here. A career watermark. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00004YZFR|5.0|A uniquely powerful movie. Scenes of the advance work for Altamont impart a queasy feeling of dread. Then, coverage of concert juxtaposes fabulous renditions of Stones tunes with the emerging reality of a volatile situation just off-stage. There, drugged-out Hells Angels bikers start beating audience members causing one fatality.  Jagger's numbed expression as he sees the playback of that particular incident is unforgettable.  A fascinating, frightening film that records a wild moment in our popular culture.
B000000W5N|5.0|Good lord.  With the Beatles fizzling out at the tail end of the 60s, the Stones picked a great time to step it up a notch.  First \\"Let It Bleed\\", then \\"Exile on Main Street\\", now this.  Whether you choose the Beatles or the Stones (or some other group) as all time champ of the rock and roll crown, you have to admit that there are just some things that the Beatles could never measure up to the Stones on:  for one thing, the hard driving riff at the center of \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" would probably drive the Fab Four into convulsions.  Another thing that we find the Stones flowering into on \\"Sticky Fingers\\" that the Beatles never attempted is a legitimate stab at country (if you say \\"Act Naturally\\" I will personally carve your heart out and feed it to Keith Richards' drug habit).  In all fairness country-rock was only being ushered in as the Beatles faded away, but even with the idealism hindsight affords it's difficult to see John Lennon or Paul McCartney even attempting something as authentic as \\"Wild Horses\\" or \\"Dead Flowers\\".  The latter, in particular, has come down to us as one of the more frequently covered tunes in the recent Americana genre, with artists as respectable as Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle taking a stab at it, although of course \\"Wild Horses\\" is the more well-known overall.      And while the Beatles were content to let their take on the drug culture be represented by sly winks such as \\"I get high with a little help from my friends\\", the Stones were taking it all the way with songs like \\"Sister Morphine\\".  Sure, this was a few years later, and dialogue was undoubtedly more open about drugs in 1972 than it was in 1967, but then \\"Velvet Underground & Nico\\" also dates from '67 and includes the immortal \\"Heroin\\" (which really even leaves \\"Sister Morphine\\" in the dust, but I digress).  One major factor that surely must contribute to the opening of lines of communication vis a vis narcotics were the back-to-back overdoses of Jimi Hendrix, JanisJoplin, & Jim Morrison in 1970-71.  This passing of three of the greatest forces in rock almost simultaneously couldn't help but strike most people as some sort of divine warning, and increasingly musical artists were taking advantage of this new awareness to pen the most blunt and frightening drug tales since the (now-disbanded) Velvet Underground.  But then, no one but a small group of clued in hipsters actually listened to the VU prior to their breakup.       But it's the Stones we're dealing with here.  I haven't forgotten that at all, but this is such a monumental album that it deserves to be discussed in a historical context rather than being relegated to a blow-by-blow song analysis.  Suffice to say there is not only a complete lack of filler but at least half these songs are all-time must-have classics.  The era from about 1969-1972 (\\"Sticky Fingers\\" was the last full-blown masterpiece until \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"Tattoo You\\") was the height of the Stones creative output, and they sound so revved up during this period that the majority of neo-garage bands sound like Gerry & the Pacemakers compared to this stuff.  It also bears mentioning for the historical record that the New York Dolls made their recorded debut in 1972 also, surely no coincidence as they never could have existed without the amphetamine crank of the mid-period Stones.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A lyrical, nostalgic Valentine to our country at the turn of the century, Director Minnelli brings his flair for color, costumes and setting to create a sumptuous visual treat. Film is extremely nice on the ears too, as young Judy (never more luminous) sings \\"The Trolley Song\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and more.  A timeless treat for the whole family.
B000002UAX|5.0|The \\"White Album\\" is the well-documented falling apart of the Beatles empire, not just a prologue, mind you, but the evidence of a band almost fully imploded and merely hanging in there by the skin of their teeth.  Despite the fact that the songs were still being credited to Lennon-McCartney (a pact the two had made prior to stardom and one which they kept to the very end) the two were not to be found much in the same room anymore, let alone collaborating on any new tunes.  George and Ringo had always pretty much gone it alone, so the fact that the self-titled, so called \\"White Album\\" seems like a compilation of solo efforts is no small coincidence. <br /> <br />Most of the record is still Lennon-McCartney material, with George Harrison kicking in his standard handful of tunes (in this case four out of the total 30 tracks) and Ringo piping in for his obligatory one-off solo performance.  Of the \\"lesser\\" two Beatles, it's Harrison who comes out on top, with the Eric Clapton-assisted \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" being the finest song he'd ever written and arguably the best on the album.  Nonetheless, the relatively disposable quality of his other three contributions would point tellingly to his inconsistent solo career.  Ringo turns in a passable (no pun intended) performance on \\"Don't Pass Me By\\", although the objective fan had, quite rightly, come not to expect much out of the colorful drummer (this was, however, his first full blown solo composition). <br /> <br />So the strength, not to mention the bulk, of the album is taken up by the Lennon-McCartney tangent, and although lyrically they seem to be content penning nonsensical lyrics rather than revealing anything about their psyches which might let the listener in on their growing alienation, from a melodic standpoint both did some of their best writing for this album.  It's true what some have said about how this would have easily been the band's best album had they culled it down to a single record, but hey:it's the Beatles.  If they recorded it it's probably worth hearing, so better fatten up an album with a few lesser songs than have fans wondering for years how they can get their hands on those \\"lost\\" tracks.   <br /> <br />Since there is so much to wade through, I'll forego calling out the weaker tracks.  Suffice to say there is nothing that's not worth hearing on \\"White Album\\", but some songs are undeniably better than others, while those others are better left to the hardcore fan.  So for the purposes of celebrating the genius of Paul McCartney and John Lennon let's stick with those songs that make this a five-star album. <br /> <br />By 1968 the Beatles - and Paul McCartney in particular - were feeling the threat of the Beach Boys at their hind.  While far from egoists, Paul and John realized that they were considered the best band in the world and Paul, even moreso than John, felt a duty to try to uphold that standard of excellence (it's doubtful he considered it any kind of \\"title\\").  \\"Back in the USSR\\" is ingenious in that it is both an attempt to outdo Brian Wilson and company at their own game while at the same time respectfully acknowledging their greatness.  Again, Paul was never afraid of a little competition, a fact illustrated by the fact that in those days Paul and John had long been friends of their British arch-rivals, the Rolling Stones.  \\"USSR\\" fades into the Lennon tune \\"Dear Prudence\\", a haunting elegy that, along with the similar \\"Julia\\", marks some of Lennon's most elegant work.  \\"Julia\\" is a bit warmer than \\"Prudence\\", the latter being a hymn to alienated youth while the former was more of a straight ahead love poem.  \\"Dear Prudence\\" would be covered fifteen years later by Siouxsie & the Banshees in a fairly straight forward version that belied the Beatles influence on New Wave (amongst more or less all other subsequent rock and pop permutations).   <br /> <br />\\"Glass Onion\\" is fairly disposable, but is still one of the better known songs on the album, probably because of the way it's sandwiched between three of the record's best tunes.  The third of those, \\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da\\" follows, a hybrid reggae/polka beat underpinning another series of Paul's nonsensical lyrics which are nonetheless carried across splendidly by Paul's overbrimming enthusiasm. <br /> <br />From there on out, the filler increases, meaning one has to search a litter harder for the gems, but they're in there.  In addition to the aforementioned \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Julia\\", there's \\"Birthday\\", Paul's salute to both aging companions and the whole 50s rock era; \\"Happiness Is a Warm Gun\\", a messy but mostly auspicious experiment in song structure and Lennon's by now famous Dadaesque lyrics; \\"Rocky Raccoon\\", another McCartney number with tossaway lyrics but a brilliant sing-along melody; \\"Blackbird\\", a McCartney lullaby; and of course \\"Helter Skelter\\", one of the heaviest Beatles songs and a good attempt at keeping up with the increasingly overdriven state of rock and roll guitar.  There are a few other minor faves to be found once the above have been worn out (ie. \\"Sexy Sadie\\", \\"Why Don't We Do It in the Road?\\", etc), but be forewarned that neither \\"Revolution 1\\" or \\"Revolution 9\\" are the more famous \\"you say you want a revolution\\" tune that was famously (or rather infamously) licensed to a sport shoe company in the late 80s/early 90s - an integral part of the tiff between Paul Mac and Michael Jackson which persists to this day.  In fact, the real gift of the \\"White Album\\" is that once those classic songs have worn out their welcome there is an abundance of other good, if not great, material to continue getting acquainted with.  Bloated or not, the \\"White Album\\" is still up there with the best of the Beatles. <br /> <br />
B000096IBI|5.0|More a silent film with sound than a sound film-- and replete with Chaplins signature visual gags and set pieces-- this title works as initial exposure to Chaplin for kids, with Goddard  an adorable foil.
B000002H97|5.0|Even though it can now be half a decade or so before Metallica gets around to burying their personal difficulties and putting out another album, the three years between \\"...And Justice For All\\" and \\"The Black Album\\" (nee \\"Metallica\\") seemed an eternity at the time. Coming off the heels of the \\"Enter Sandman\\" single, Metallica seemed poised to break into the mainstream at long last. But at what expense? <br />\\"Enter Sandman\\" appeared to spell the end of James Hetfield's heartfelt lyrics and the band's fervor for complex and innovative song structures. Sure it rocked, but in a way that could be endlessly recycled by other bands it inspired. The beauty of albums like \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is that they were unique and brilliant enough in their own right that even the most heavily influenced of bands were unable to duplicate their success. Would Metallica trade that patented sound for a more stripped down approach that in six months would already seem played out? <br /> <br />Fortunately this turned out to not be the case. The remainder of the album WAS in fact fairly stripped down and economized, but with songs like \\"The Unforgiven\\" and \\"Sad But True\\" Metallica proved that, new sound or not, this was not the watered down, Mom-friendly metal they'd be churning out in just a few years' time. \\"The Unforgiven\\" is itself perhaps James Hetfield's lyrical masterpiece, and compared to the soggy sentimentalism of \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" the song proves that the band could still be topical without being leaden and morose.  <br /> <br />\\"Nothing Else Matters\\", though megapopular amongst fans of both \\"The Black Album\\" and the latter material, is to these ears the point at which the album begins to falter. Although it's fraternal lyrics have brought a tear or two to many eyes when the song is played live, it bears too strong an aesthetic resemblance to MOR pap like \\"That's What Friends Are For\\" to fit comfortably into the Metallica oeuvre. \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" continues Hetfield's quizzical new obsession with monster movie lyrics, and the concluding trilogy of \\"The God That Failed\\", \\"My Friend of Misery\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\" are fine songs in their own right, but fail to maintain the standard set by the album's opening half. Though inconsistent, there isn't really a bad song on the record, which makes \\"The Black Album\\" Metallica's last stab at greatness. <br /> <br />
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Veteran documentarian Errol Morris hits a career peak with this probing, perceptive film. \\"Fog\\" tells a very human story while providing hard-edged insight into fateful decisions made at the highest levels. Fascinating historical perspective, and great brain food, as McNamara's widely acknowledged brilliance is very much on display. A cautionary tale about the downsides of hubris and leadership.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This DVD bases on real stories. It is really touching! I like it so much!
078322611X|5.0|Beautifully realized, old-fashioned fantasy movie that raises the spirit and touches the heart.  James Earl Jones provides magnificent support as a reclusive writer who joins Kinsella on his crusade, and Ray Liotta is also solid playing \\"Shoeless Joe \\"Jackson. Goes down just as well on repeat viewings.
B00092ZL80|4.0|I just saw this concert in July 2005 and was thrilled so I had to buy the DVD. I think the performances by Earth Wind and Fire and Chicage are excellent (just like they were live). My only complaint was that it appears that an octave divider was used on the bass guitar (for both bands) in the post-production. Maybe it bothers me more than others because I'm a bassist but it drove me nuts by about halfway through the DVD to hear bass that doesn't sound like bass. I guess somebody just couldn't resist pushing that new \\"button\\".
B0006J28KU|5.0|A long, graphic and pounding crime story, Heat is violent and not for the faint of heart. Still, it's a smart, riveting and extremely well-acted thriller. There are few lulls, and it's a treat to see DeNiro and Pacino on screen together.
B00006ADFL|5.0|I have lived in Christchurch all of my life, and it truly is a wonderful city to call home.  But, as Heavenly Creatures points out, it is also home to one of the biggest scandals in New Zealand history.<br /><br />The murder of Honora Parker raised many eyebrows during the winter of 1954.  Firstly because she was murdered by her daughter Pauline, and Pauline's best friend Juliet.  Secondly because it was discovered after the murder that Honora was not actually 'married' to her husband Mr Rieper.  Even though she went about her life as Honora Rieper, she was hiding a mini scandal of her own (in 1950's New Zealand life).<br /><br />The day of the murder was 22 June 1954, and it was an unseasonably warm day during what had otherwise been a very cold winter.  It was so warm in fact that many people skipped work or school and headed outdoors.  My own Grandmother took a 'day off' from work and actually spent the day in Victoria Park.  It wasn't until she returned home and turned on her radio that night that she had been at the Murder site that very day.<br /><br />Peter Jackson does a wonderful job of capturing Christchurch in the 1950's and telling the shocking but true story of Parker and Hulme, and the desires that drove them to murder Honora.  While the city has changed much since 1954, there are still many reminders from the story of Parker and Hulme.  Both family homes still stand, as does the former High School and former University, as portrayed in the movie.  Victoria Park continues to be a popular picnic spot - and no other notable crimes have ever been committed there.<br /><br />From a historical standpoint, this movie makes for great viewing.  Includes archival news footage and features many of New Zealands most talented actors - such as Melanie Lynsky.
B00011D1RC|5.0|MGM-- the most prestigious studio from Hollywoods golden age-- paints on the gloss for this first class ensemble production.  Garbo and John Barrymore stand out as the doomed lovers, as does his brother, Lionel, who plays a timid and terminally ill clerk on his last spree. Grand Hotel was among the first MGM sound dramas to showcase two things:  First, the studios unmatched ability to adapt serious literary material to motion pictures; and second, to attract and retain star talent. The movie still dazzles nearly seventy-five years after its release.
B00005JLEU|5.0|A friend introduced me to this short magical film that does not have a distinctive story etched to the contcatanating skeins of a vividly visual experience.  I really loved this fairly new concept (perhaps a hitherto but underexposed aspect of Oriental culture) in a spirit world, parrallel to our own where ghosts can converge to have a bath and a little girl, lost in it does her utmost to save her porcine parents from being eaten up.  Fortunately she has friends, queer, wonderful friends and the means to hand if only she trusts herself/others and her own heart in a multidimensional adventure in which one is never sure what could happen next.  Overall there are little vignettes of a strange spirit world and it leads to a conclusion but not a conventional ending.  This film is not just for children though children would enjoy it and find it scary.  A very wholesome, lavish expose of the ghost world and its interaction with our seemingly more real domain.  Quite magical.
B00003OSU4|5.0|My personal 50s sci-fi favorite, \\"Invasion\\" is an ingenious nightmare vision that reflects the paranoia of the time created by McCarthyism.  Absent of the effects that characterize more recent entries in this genre, the film remains genuinely creepy strictly on the basis of story, direction and performances.

B00003CXB4|2.0|You know what you are buying when you buy a Disney product.  There is no question that you get a top quality cartoon...but the rest is just rude. <br /> <br />Lion King is to my opinion the best Disney cartoon there has been made.  The plot, the characters and just everything about the cartoon is fascanating.  Five stars fort the actual cartoon. <br /> <br />How ever, you get an insight in what kind of a \\"dinosaur\\" Disney has become when you try to play the DVD. <br /> <br />First of all; you are forced to watch all the other disney commercials -1star. <br /> <br />If you wish to watch it on PC, you are forced to install a special program from Disney -2stars.  Just not necessary since the VLC player can play the cartoon perfectly and is not as boring as this Disney player.   <br /> <br />To summerize; you pay for a top product and get commercials and boring program.  Sorry Disney - but I just cannot accept that and give a good review.   <br /> <br />More artists and less laywers, that is my advice.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have been a fan of Science Fiction for as long as I can remember.  From novels, short stories, TV series and movies.  I am not a huge fan of TV these days and am sorry that I missed this series when it orginally aired.. in a way.  Having seen the episodes in the order in which they were intended makes a difference with this series.  Watching them in the order they were aired only confuses things. <br /> <br />This epic not only won me over, it bowled me over.  Taking my wife and two eldest daughters (12 & 18) with me.  It is fresh, insightful, intelligent, humorous... it is REAL.  You can believe in the characters, the time, the places, the situations.  It all FITS.  I have never seen anything like it, nor do I believe I will see anything of this caliber on TV anytime soon. <br /> <br />I am pleased to hear that a movie based on the series will be released in September (go to [...] for more info).   <br /> <br />I would hope that the series bolstered by the movie and increasing fan base would be picked up and continued.  I would love to see where it would lead.
B00062IVKI|4.0|A failed experiment can still have value!  Scorsese attempted to contrast a highly realistic, improvised acting style with a highly stylized, artificial filmmaking style reminiscent of the great MGM musicals.  It didn't quite work, but it did give us some fantastic moments, indluding:    1. DeNiro and Minnelli's first meeting (an incredibly well-played and funny scene)    2. DeNiro's marriage proposal (lots of fun)    3. Their fight in the car (one of the most frighteningly real arguments a couple has ever had onscreen)    Minelli is able to hold her own quite well against DeNiro in these scenes, and I think their chemistry is fascinating.    Add to this some fantastic musical numbers, and you have a film whose individual moments make up for its larger flaws.  In other words, don't miss the trees for the forest.    The DVD contains some great goodies, the best being the additional versions of a number scenes.  Since these were all improvised, every take was different and you get to see completely different dialogue, including the unused happy ending!    All in all, I'm glad I got it.
B0002OERI0|5.0|yeah we all know, this isnt punk but its still a good album and it should be worth listening to, and yeah they do say a few political things in there but if u really hate that stuff just skip the first song. <br /> <br />honestly i hate american idiot (the song) because i heard to much of it and it got old but its still a good song and worth listening to <br /> <br />jesus of suberbeia is a great song with many differnt parts, and its long! over 9 minutes <br /> <br />holiday is overplayed but its really good and i like it <br /> <br />blvd. of broken dreams another overplayed song but again really good <br /> <br />we are the waiting is a slower song honestly i have nothing more to say about it <br /> <br />st. jimmy is classic greenday, very fast and full of energy <br /> <br />give me novacaine is my favorite, about drug use and stuff <br /> <br />she's a rebel more classic greenday and nother fast song <br /> <br />extordinary girl (sorry for speeling) sounds a bit differnt then the other songs but its still good <br /> <br />letterbomb is maybe the best song on here (besides jesus of suberbeia) <br /> <br />wake me up when september ends is very slow but i found it really depressing the first time i heard it (and usually songs dont do that) <br /> <br />homecoming is another long 9 minute song but again a great song <br /> <br />whatserface really i dont like this song but still good to listen to <br /> <br /> <br />and another thing about this album is that there is a story in it, although i dont want to ruin it it could mean differnt things  depends on who listens to it <br /> <br />well overall its a great album and is great to see among all the no talent artest out there
B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD is worth watching over and over.  It has a very soothing approach and beautiful Irish women.

B0007P3582|3.0|Here it is again, another completely G-Unit album. Meaning, there is sizzling beats, hot vocals, and a lot of recurring patterns. As much as I like 50, his material is growing VERY thin. On Get Rich or Die Tryin', 50 perfected his style, the sing-songy choruses about killing, revenge, and money. Lots and lots of money. Even though I became bored with the album, I liked the fresh, completely gangsta style that he embodied. then comes Beg for Mercy. Yep, more 50, just with Lloyd Banks and Young Buck. Still the same synth notes and tiresome vocals. Then comes Hunger for More, Lloyd Banks' debut album. More of the old. Young Buck's album drops next, Straight Outta Ca$hville. I didn't look at it, already well-aware of what it contained. Finally, the Massacre arrives, and even though I'd never heard it before, I felt like I already knew it by heart. Do I see a common trend here? <br />Yes, there is. The trend is that G-Unit and the production team keeps churning out good, but far from great albums one by one. And while they are nowhere near bad, they're more than disappointing. I expect more. 50 Cent's hubris has now engulfed him and his G-Unit posse. He is already comfortable with his results. He knows he will sell. But does he care about the music? I'm not really sure. That's why it's hard to take him seriously. The Massacre does have some tight tracks, but it is mostly filler. Piggy Bank is awesome, and so is Outta Control. Tracks like those make me come running back to 50. But most of the others are garbage. Nice for playing on long trips, but also very effective sleeping pills. By the way, get the collector's edition album, because the Outta Control remix is the best track on the album. Overall, the Massacre is worthy of being a G-Unit album. But it is still boring, and 50 can do better. Good luck, listeners. Don't fall asleep.
6305508550|5.0|This is one that EVERY potential office manager should be forced to watch.  You will find yourself saying \\"I know that guy\\" with every scene.  Really great, hillarious, definate Calssic right off the bat!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|My title says it all, maybe the best in twenty years. <br />Since Mr. Adams has two more dics coming before the end <br />of the year, who knows.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|As time goes by, a small village builds upon itself, changes, and eventually becomes a bustling city. This city, Avenged Sevenfold's \\"City of Evil\\" is one that I'd like to stop at, visit, tour, and talk about for the rest of my life. <br /> <br />I had only begun listening to Avenged Sevenfold when the news of \\"City of Evil\\" reached me. I was a fan of the early \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and especially \\"Waking the Fallen.\\" Its sound, loaded with epic guitars and screamy vocals, was something I really got into. I was disappointed to hear that M. Shadows' vocals would be limited to singing, but \\"City of Evil\\" showed me that it isn't fair to turn your back on a band that has more talent than I had ever imagined. <br /> <br />The pulse-pounding introduction of \\"Beast and the Harlot\\" sent adrenaline pumping through me and almost cooled me off before the second song, \\"Burn it Down,\\" injected me with yet another burst of energy. Before I knew it, \\"Blinded in Chains\\" kept going where \\"Burn it Down\\" left off. \\"Bat Country\\" is arguably the most catchy song on the album, and follows \\"Blinded in Chains\\" but takes on a completely different sound. \\"Trashed and Scattered\\" is the next song, and puts a little anger into the mix. \\"Seize the Day\\" slows things down and fills the now-traditional \\"Avenged Sevenfold slow song track.\\" <br /> <br />The second half of the album is a little harder to get into at first. \\"Sidewinder,\\" a song about snakes, was pretty difficult to get into until I really started listening to it. The flamenco ending is something I never expected, but after time, \\"Sidewinder\\" was my favorite song on the album. \\"The Wicked End\\" follows the snake song and completely mixes punk, rock, and metal together for a tasty treat. Following this song is \\"Strength of the World,\\" which was my least favorite song on the album in terms of vocals but still sounds amazing. \\"Betrayed\\" is the tenth song on the album and sounds great as well. It is probably the song I've listened to the least, but of the few times I've heard it, I recognize that it has a certain something that makes me enjoy it more and more each time. Last of all, \\"MIA\\" is a great finisher and delivers the most political charge out of any of the songs. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I can't even see where metalheads and Avenged Sevenfold purists are coming from when they complain about \\"City of Evil.\\" Maybe it's just me, but this album shows more signs of 1980's metal than anything. There's the occasional punk or rock fusion, but that's what A7X has been doing since their beginning. If I were stranded on an island and could only choose three albums to listen to for the rest of my life, alongside \\"Waking the Fallen,\\" this would be my second choice.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is such an emotional experience for me because it is the only real artistic connection that I have to 9/11.  Of course, Wilco wrote the album before 9/11, but the album's lyrics,  sonic juxtaposition of chaotic distortion and rootsy beauty, and distinctly American themes resonate so powerfully in my mind that I can't help but connect myself to 9/11 when I listen to the album.  Even the cover art of twin towers (albeit of a Chicago landmark) seems in recognition of 9/11. <br /> <br />The first song that I really correlated to 9/11 is \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" The chorus goes, \\"Tall buildings shake/Voices escape singing sad sad songs/tuned to chords/Strung down your cheeks/Bitter melodies turning your orbit around.\\"  Beautiful, harmonized violins contribute a truly haunting mood.  The bridge goes, \\"Skyscrapers are scraping together/Your voice is smoking.\\"  The central idea of the song is beautifully redemptive without being schmaltzy or cliche.  \\"Our love, our love is all we have/Our love is all god's money/Every one is a burning sun.\\"  Isn't that true?  At the end of the day, our love really is all we have... <br /> <br />\\"Ashes of American Flags\\" is about disgust at American consumerism, which I felt completely after 9/11 as our government and economy utilized the tragedy for profit.  \\"I wonder why we listen to poets when nobody gives a f***/How hot and sorrowful, the machine begs for luck...I would like to salute/the ashes of American flags/And all the fallen leaves/filling up shopping bags.\\"  That's how I felt, and singer, Jeff Tweedy touches on the same theme of cultural disenchantment in \\"Radio Cure,\\" as he expresses confusion at \\"radio cures\\" and \\"electronic surgical wars.\\"   <br />When our President used 9/11 to justify a misguded war, the song \\"War on War\\" is utterly powerful and relevant.   <br /> <br />Of course, these are only a handful of songs on the album.  But Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, as a whole, has a rootsy, acoustic feel to it that, coupled with the (unintentionally) 9/11-themed songs, conjure feelings of American values and patriotism. On two of the most upbeat songs, \\"I'm the Man who loves You\\" and \\"Heavy Metal Drummer,\\" the instrumentation and down-home charm that Tweedy brings is indicative of Wilco's roots as an alt-country band.  This album makes me proud to be an American in an odd way.  It's contemplative and well-written, and most importantly, (I interpret it as) as an unpretentious but nuanced testament to America, love, and the respect that tragedy deserves. Jeff Tweedy, you are a poet, and I do give a f***.
B0002IU988|5.0|Okay, I admit that I did not want to buy this CD.  I heard Broken Wings and I just couldn't get it out of my head.  I was skeptical because I thought that it would just be one hit and the rest would be like the worst of Creed.  Don't get me wrong, I like Creed, but I don't feel that their CDs are fabulous.  I have all of their CDs and I don't play them very often because most of the best songs were worn out on the radio.  Well, that is not the case with Alter Bridge.  I actually wish I had heard more of their CD sooner.  I LOVE IT!  It is so good that I can't imagine anyone that likes alternative rock not liking it.  You can't go by the 30 second clips either.  You need to hear it all.  My favorite has got to be Shed My Skin.  Kennedy's vocals give me chills!  Also, Watch Your Words is made for blasting on the car stereo.  Borrow a friends copy or check it out at your local library.  Do whatever it takes!  You have to hear it to believe it!
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is a lovely, hypnotic listening experience.  The album primarily consists of atmospheric keyboards, guitars, alternatingly programmed drumbeats and live drumming, and the etheral vocals of Thom Yorke.  The gulf between live and electronic music is effectively bridged, especially in songs like \\"Optimistic\\" and \\"National Anthem\\" where it's difficult to tell what is keyboard and what is straight-up drums, bass, and guitar.  The focus of Kid A is repetition and building a mood.  The individual songs build to extraordinary, anguished climaxes usually without divulging from a relatively simplistic chord structure.  Kid A may seem structureless upon first listen, but the patterns are there, and the greatness of the album is Radiohead's ability to keep those patterns interesting by their songwriting ingenuity and musicianship.  There are lyrics, but they are sparse.  Thom Yorke's brilliant vocals work like any musical instrument- expressing an anguish and emotion that renders specific words unnecessary.  Eventually the electronic sounds used on this album will sound dated (as all electronic sounds eventually do with the onest of new electronic sounds) but even when that happens, the merits of the album will persevere.  Why?  Because it communicates a specific feel, regardless of its literateness or correctness in the scope of traditional rock music.  And that \\"feel\\" feels wonderful.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I love this movie. It is so funny and Ben Stiller is just incredible. Great great movie if you are in need of a pick me up.
B00004XMS0|3.0|NOTE - I won't take too much time to review the movies, because there are plenty of other reviews here to do that for you.    The first movie from 1989, \\"Batman\\", is considered by many to be the best superhero movie ever.  I agree except for \\"Superman: The Movie\\" and the new film \\"Batman Begins.\\"  Jack Nicholson's turn as The Joker is classic, but many underestimate Michael Keaton's portrayal of a reclusive and enigmatic Bruce Wayne.  I'm told that this image is not true to the comics, but this approach fits very well with Tim Burton's dark vision of the comics.    The 1992 sequel, \\"Batman Begins\\" is a good follow-up.  The dark mood of Gotham City's Christmas is very intriguing to me.  I love Michelle Pfeiffer as Selene Kyle/Catwoman.  The Penguin is not very interesting to me, but Danny Devito kept my interest very well considering that I don't really like the character.  This movie excels with special effects and set design, but Bruce Wayne's character doesn't really change much.    Joel Schumacher took a stab in 1995's \\"Batman Forever\\", which reimagined Gotham City as a vibrant, neo-fantasy setting.  I love that visual style, as well as Elliot Goldenthal's musical score (even though Danny Elfman's for Tim Burton is timeless).  Val Kilmer is a good replacement, but my criticisms for the villains (Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face and Jim Carrey as The Riddler) are this...they're expertly-acted roles, but not expertly written.  Instead of being treated as lunatics, a more human approach to those two like Catwoman and The Joker received would've helped.  Still, a good action movie that introduces Robin (Chris O'Donnell is okay here guys, give him a break!)    I love the production design of 1997s \\"Batman & Robin\\", but the campy appraoch that mirrors the 1960s show was not the right way.  George Clooney doesn't offer much, even when Michael Gough's role as Alfred Pennyworth reaches out with more character than usual.  Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze was a good idea, but the direction in which they took the movie's tone really hurt his potential.  The same goes for Robin (Chris O'Donnell) and Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman).  A lot of potential, but this was before superhero filmmakers understood that the characters needed to be taken seriously.  However, Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl is atrocious.  That one I'll just have to deal with.    Okay then, so we get one great movie with two solid sequels, and a below-average finish.  However, I can't easily recommended this box-set because in October 2005, Warner Bros. released all four of these movies with tons of features.  As a result, these DVDs from the \\"Minimalist Age\\" are not going to be worth much.  The video and sound quality is solid in all of them, but the lack of Extras really devalues this box-set.  If you don't need Extras, then pick this collection up.  If you want grade-A DVD...pick up the \\"Batman Anthology,\\" which is a vastly superior package.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This movie was really the WORST I've seen in a lot of time.  Special effects were awesome, but the story was really terribly sad.  Dialoges, actor's performance....well <br /> <br />Really skip it.  Not worth it.
B000002LSV|2.0|ZZ top is a great band thats why ig ave this 2 stars.....but this greatest hits album lacks there early stuff. Its mostly from 77 and on like there MTV days when they became \\"pop\\". If you whant there early stuff (wich is better in my opinoin buy there first 2 albums).
0783225903|1.0|First of all I don't normally write reviews but I had to go out of my way for this movie. I am a very open-minded critic when it comes to movies. This movie was simply torture. Brazil is the most overrated film of all time, because I couldn't find absolutely anything worth liking in the movie. The sets look fake. Like some other reviewers claim there are no performances that stand out. Even De Niro's performance was weak. The movie was incredibly boring from the beginning. I forced myself to watch this junk hoping it would get better at the end. After all it is one of the best films of the 80s right? Wrong! Contrary to what people say the film is NOT a comedy. Nothing funny about it, except how it's considered a cult classic. Studios have made plenty of mistakes by not promoting movies or by censoring the directors. However, in this case, the studio should have forgotten about censorship and never released this movie to save us from the agony of watching this garbage. Comparing this movie to \\"The Matrix\\" is a sin! F-    WORST. MOVIE. EVER.
B000002O4S|5.0|Great soundtrack and overall Alan Silvestri's best. Power of love and back in time some of Huey's best. It really reminds you of how great the film is. Forgot the soundtracks for 2 and 3 stick with this one.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Before reading the reviews regarding Equilibrium on Amazon, I had never heard of the film. I was looking for some quality science fiction movies, with higher ratings, that I had yet to watch. After reading about Equilibium, I decided to rent it.<br /><br />To be honest, I didn't expect much. I wasn't familiar with the actors, and I am always leary about movies that feature alot of action scenes. With that said, Equilibruim exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />It is the story of a \\"future cop\\" who is at the top of his game. The twist? Feelings are not allowed. World War III has turned mankind into haters of all things artistic and expressive, and even things as laughter or grief will bring about the death penalty. This \\"cop\\" has the job of moping up the criminals; those who express feelings, or possess such forbidden objects as books, music,paintings, etc.<br /><br />While the movie does have some awesome actions scenes, it also has captivating characters, above average acting, quality directing and a good story. There are many bad action movies on the market, but Equilibrium will not disappoint. It is sci-fi/future/martial arts/action will a unique story twist.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 45<br /><br />25 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />5 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />5 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />6 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />4 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?
B00005R1N3|5.0|just wanted to contribute to the discussion about these two films....John Carpenter was a huge fan of black christmas, and he and bob clark were actually discussing a sequel to the movie, wherein \\"billy\\" escapes from an insane asylum and wreaks havoc. the deal fell through, but john carpenter carried over some of the ideas, giving us the genius that is halloween. i LOVE both movies; both are fine examples of the origins of the slasher genre, before blood and gore took the place of suspense. they're violent, disturbing movies, no doubt about it, but compared to the mayhem that followed in the eighties, they're masterpieces of understatement.
B00003CX8N|5.0|I had recalled seeing this film in the theater years ago, but couldn't remember much about it. I decided to try it again and was so impressed that I bought it immediately. They don't make many like it anymore and that is too bad. Great characters, a good range of emotion, and nice depictions of time and place make this film extremely enjoyable. Whether you are a bibliophile or not, give \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" a real try.
B0007GAEGC|1.0|This CD is an excellent example of why some of us have stopped contributing to PBS. Why do I bother to review something I find so irrelevant? Only because the term \\"classical\\" is used by the Amazon reviewer and others. There is nothing remotely approaching classical music in this compilation of dental office Muzak; no potential buyer should be conned into thinking there's classical music here. Even Lawrence Welk would have been ashamed to put his name on drivel like this.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Easily the best film of the year.  Never has sequential art been so fully realized on the screen before.  Breathtaking and groundbreaking.  Nuff said.
1573223026|5.0|There seems to be a new literary movement in the UK right now and I suppose Mr Hornby is at the forefront ( inspiring others like Tony Parsons, Steve Horsfall, Mike Gayle etc). The style of 'A long Way Down' is indictive of the 'UK Lifetsyle genre' focussing on character driven tales the pulls the reader in through familiarity or sympathy. The characters in the book represent a theme of despair (suicidal) and yet Nick Hornby is able to gain empathy through humor and structured characterization. Very Good.
068987474X|1.0|This book is great for gullible women who believe that they really need advice from an \\"expert\\" to realize that a man isn't that into her. I couldn't even make it through the entire book simply because I got tired of all the excuses made by these dillusional women for men who really aren't even worth it.  This book is a generalization stating that all men are the same, when they are not. Each situation is different, and all it takes to figure out that a man is not that into you is a little common sense. Anyone who feels they actually need advice from this complete stranger, obviously needs a book on common sense.
B00025ETIW|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD I LISTEN 2 IT EVERYDAY AN NEVER GET SICK OF IT I JUST A FANATIC
B00003CX95|5.0|I don't understand how some people can describe this story line as boring and cheesy.  Yes some historical facts are incorrect and have been changed probably so it can actually be made into a motion picture that would sell thats why it's BASED on a true story.  Braveheart is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  One that can leave almost anyone moved by the end.   <br /> <br />I also like how people tried to accuse mel of targeting countries that were anti catholic.  Now that one made me giggle.
B00026WU82|5.0|I started listening to Bob Dylan when I was eighteen years old and lived in Calcutta, India.  This was before the 'glory' days of corporate globalization and the global brands hadn't painted the nation with its broad strokes of corporate colour.  No MTV, just a state controlled basic TV for under 30 hours a week in all meant that we listened to good music and read good books.  We realized early that good music, like good literature had no political boundaries, yet so much of it was pure politics.   <br /> <br />Arindam Mitra, an old friend of mine, now settled in Mumbai, gave me the vinyl LP and swear to god, I probably listened to it a 100 times in a short span of time.  It wasn't my first Dylan album, but it was one that would have an indelible mark on a young mind.   <br /> <br />Music, as you know, in its best form, can change your life.    <br /> <br />I wonder if there's one performer these days who even comes close to having the ability to make a record of this stature.  The words are like burning coal, the music like rolling thunder and hits you like a jet plane.   <br /> <br />I do not recommend that you go and buy this album unless you are exploring what real music is all about.  On the other hand, if you do decide to listen to Highway 61 for the first time, it may well change your life.   <br /> <br />If you do possess this album, go and listen to it again.  Mr. Dylan may tell you something completely different this time.
B00003CXIP|5.0|I bought this version instead of the deluxe version because it is alot cheaper plus has most of the features that are on the deluxe version. Beside that, I grew up watching this movie as a kid and always loved it. It was one of those movies that has everything. Comedy, drama, and a little intensitity. Based on the novella The Body by Stephen King, which showed that King could entertain us without horror. The actors are amazing in their roles. Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix (R.I.P.), Corey Feldman, and Jerry O'Connell bring four friends to life and I really thought they were friends in the film. The scenes between Phoenix and Wheaton are exceptionally good. Kiefer Sutherland is amazingly convincing in his role as the leader of a gang of bullies who always torment the four boys. Also making small appearances are John Cusak and Richard Dreyfuss as the adult version of Wheaton's character and nararates the tale. Directed by Rob Reiner, this film will always be a classic in my eyes. Highly Highly Recommended.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|After reading a couple reviews for this title, I decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.  Daft Punk has made some of the best music in the last decade.  Though not to many people have been turned on to \\"electronica\\", they should consider Interstella.  No dialouge whatsoever and that I believe is one of the movies strengths.  It relys on Daft Punk's music to gudie you through the film.  Before you know it you have connected with the characters and are suprised at how quickly the movie is over. <br /> <br />Highly recommended
B000002LFU|5.0|R.E.M.'s first album with Warner Records is a pretty good album. Not as mellow as their earlier albums, nor as mainstream as the ones to come. This was the beginning of the transformation of R.E.M. The most well known song on this album is Orange Crush which is a very good song. The lyrics are very good on this album especially on World Leader Pretend. Favorites include Pop Song 89, Get Up, You Are the Everything, Stand, World Leader Pretend, Orange Crush, Turn You Inside-Out, I Remember California, and the uknown named 11th track. This cd is good and could be listen throughly without skipping a song. Highly Recommended.
0375703764|2.0|After one of my friends told me how scary and good this book is, and how she couldn't sleep with it in her room because it freaked her out, I thought, \\"Great! I like scary books.\\" Well, I don't see where she got the idea that it was so scary. <br /> <br />The first 50 pages of this book are lifeless. I was completely bored. Then there was a five page thing describing an echo. It was like I was reading an extremely boring textbook for school.  <br /> <br />There were a few ok parts, and some of the Johnny Traunt stuff was kind of funny. I gave it 2 stars because of the use of different fonts and how they placed the words on the page for a cool effect. <br /> <br />Oh, and whoever said you need a mirror to read some of the pages, they were just too dumb to realize that the \\"mirror-image\\" writing was actually just the same thing written on the page before, as in it had gone through the page, or whatever. <br /> <br />Don't waste your time. Read Stephen King instead.
B0002V7ODI|5.0|This movie was really good. I thought it was going to be terrible when the movie first came out. I purchase the director's cut to give it a chance. I loved this movie. Ron Pearlman was born to play Hellboy. John Hurt is great as always. I was surprised by Selma Blair's performance. She always seemed dry in her earlier movies but shes good in this. Jeffery Tambor is really funny in his role. The action scenes are stunning and there are lots of elements throughout the story. Highly Recommended.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Oh, s**t did you stumble upon the web page of your dreams. For, right now, you're on the page of one of the BEST BANDS EVER - Slipknot! Oh, f**k me freddy, if you haven't heard of them - shame on you! They are the S**T! The s**t, man. With songs like Vermillion, and Duality, these wackos push the envelope for rock. I mean, they're practically the Mozart of our era. Handcrafting lyrics of such profound intensity, intelligence, and utter jaw-dropping brilliance, you may find yourself describing them as a modern day Shakespeare of the art form. Aw, f**k, I can't tell you how awesome these guys are. Up there with Incubus, and Eminem...their sound would have anyone pissing their pants in joy. <br /> <br />Okay, if you believe one word of what I just wrote, and think I did so with even a shred of sincerety, you are either: <br />1. High as a kite <br />2. Currently in the act of getting high as a kite (but right now is only of treetop stoneability) <br />Jimminy Christmas, this band is horrible. THAT is the truth. I can't believe people like this crap, but then again, look who our country re-elected recently... Anyway, wow. The first time I heard Duality, I about laughed until I puked. Rap rock? BULL SHEE-YOOT. Bout as rap-rock as Frank f**kin Sinatra is. Makes Korn look like geniuses...almost.  <br /> <br />But, if you're some dumb@$$ high school jock-@$$ (like my f**kin wordplay?) then buy this record. If you're a proud gay idiot, or know an idiot of the homo kind, round up the queers like steers and steer em to this cd. Or if you're just one of them no-name, dropped-on-their-head-as-a-child, run of the mill dumb@$$, buy this. And promote the sorry fact that all Iowa can produce in the entertainment industry is a bunch of painted-up f**gots that shove their digits into their corneas. <br /> <br />Peace out, and have fun going nuts and hammering this review with terrible ratings.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!  Finally, a film has arrived that shows love for what it really is--a convoluted cycle of jealousy and dependency that materializes in the need to become \\"closer\\" to another human being.  It was raw, depressing, chilling, disturbing and strangely romantic.  There was minimal nudity, and no sexual content, so it is not disturbing in a visual way.  The film's dialogue and fierce acting demands attention from the audience.  We are not spoon-fed a \\"timeless love story\\" where everybody finds inner peace and virginal romance in the end.  We identify with the characters, who each reflect the dirtiness and truthfulness that hides beneath our fake veneers.  There is no sincere apologies for any wrongs committed.  It shows the ugliness and selfishness inherent in every person when dealing with romantic affairs, whether one wants to acknowledge it or not.  I think the actors and the director were so brave to concoct such a memorable piece of cinema.  Kudos to all!
B00004YX39|5.0|What is the deal with the 2-star reviews?  Those are people who just don't get it.  Gaucho is anticlimactic in the way many final group efforts tend to be.  Aja was the ultimate culmination of Donald and Walter's genius, whereas Gaucho represents the brilliant last gasp.  Even after having to scrap a song because of a major studio gaffe, they ended up with seven very good tracks.  This is one of the best albums to travel with, and also great to listen to late at night while relaxing with a lady.  The songwriting is top-rate, as always with Becker and Fagen.  Babylon Sisters is the most daring song they've ever done, and it doesn't miss a beat.  Glamour Profession and My Rival are among the lesser-known songs which deserve many close listens.  Give it time, and you'll see the light after a while.  Very sad to think this would ever be considered one of the lesser Dan efforts.
B000002KO1|5.0|Chrissie Hynde and the Pretenders were soooo unique in their day. I saw them live in New York City back on January 1982. This CD exemplifies their start. My fav is \\"Kid\\" but almost every song is good. I'll miss the \\"Honeyman\\" and \\"Petey\\" but thanks for the tunes- they were from a great time!!
B0000683DH|5.0|I grew up in the 1970s on \\"Star Trek\\" reruns.  I had the first ten issues of Starlog magazine and breathlessly read of any news of a Trek movie.  I had the Starfleet jacket (that I snagged on barbed wire the FIRST DAY I wore it).  I still have the Enterprise blueprints in the original package.<br /><br />It was a glorious time to be alive and be a sci-fi nerd, my friends.<br /><br />But STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE came out in '79...and I almost fell asleep.  It was almost as if they were afraid to cut loose and let these characters go.  Or they figured if they could cram a ton of SFX and the legions of sci-fi nerds would be happily hypnotized.<br /><br />Thank God for STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN.<br /><br />I was in college by then and had started drifting away from sci-fi, instead choosing headier movies like ALTERED STATES and BLADE RUNNER.<br /><br />But KHAN came along and restored my faith in the possibilities of Star Trek.  Even my college roommate, easily the most mocking cynical person I've ever met, got off on KHAN.  When he got drunk after seeing it, he'd lay on the floor and bellow over and over again, \\"KKKHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!\\"<br /><br />So here I am, over 20 years later, and I just watched it on cable TV.  And it's still the best Trek they've ever made.  I loved those guys.  Kirk dealing with age and a son who despised him.  Spock still stiffly trying to be a human friend to his human friends.  Bones getting crankier, Sulu, Uhura, Chekov, Scotty.<br /><br />I wish I still had that jacket.<br /><br />(Although I never had those ears....)
B0001CNRSE|5.0|Doesn't everyone wish that they could dance in a more modernising form other that just pulling your hands above your head and shaking to the beat of the music, well I know that I do and after watching this movie I soon realised that not also was it a great movie but it was inspiring. It shows that people from disturbed backgrounds who have been subjected to poverty, mistrust and being unloved can make it and who have the opportunity to do better in life even when people are not formally backing them in what they do. This movie shows that and Jessica Alba portrays this in her character. Someone who was takin up on the idea to get local kids involved in a dance school to get them off street corners selling drugs, going to jail and being subjected to physical abuse by their relatives. This was a fantastic, cultural movie to watch and the dancing was exceptional. At the end you are guarenteed to be up on your feet and dancing along with a group of 12 year old kids who are not only talented but unique. ENJOY!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|This really could have been something special. Take the classic monsters from Universal (Dracula, Frankensteins monster, Wolfman) and pit them all against a bad-ass, tooled up Van Helsing, all with today's super-duper special effects?  The result - this utter turd of a movie.<br /><br />First things first - the effects. Yes, they're good, but Sommers (he of The Mummy and Mummy returns infamy) seems to think that you don't actually NEED plot or, like, characters - you just need LOADS and LOADS and LOADS of effects, thrown at the screen every single minute. When you start to tut and roll your eyes when yet ANOTHER monster comes at the screen, or another transformation or whatever, you know something is wrong.<br /><br />And then there's Hugh Jackman himself, basically being Wolverine but with less attitude. In truth, he's about as wooden as the stakes he carries, and about as interesting.<br /><br />Add to that a TERRIBLE \\"comedy\\" tag-along partner, the worst Dracula in movie history, some of the stupidest action sequences known to man and a veering on self-parody ending and you really do have something that should be put to eternal rest. A sadly missed opportunity - and a sequel is NOT required.<br /><br />The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.uk
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie to watch
B0001L3MI0|1.0|It's hard NOT to be cynical watching Independence Day. The flag-waving, U-S-A! U-S-A! uber-patriotism gets a little waring after, say, five minutes, and when THE PRESIDENT gets into an airplane to fight those nasty aliens, you can't help but guffaw in mocking laughter.<br /><br />All that would be OK though, if the script and characters were up to scratch. But trust me - they ain't. Will Smith is in \\"cocky but loveable\\" mode, chomping on a cigar and talking about \\"whoopin' E.T's ass\\", he has a doting wife and annoying (or, ahem, \\"adorable\\" child), the President's wife can talk and relate to a stripper, the guy from Taxi is in it as the Stereotypical Jew, and Jeff Goldblum is, admittedly, the only good thing in the entire movie.<br /><br />The effects are awesome, of course, but then you would expect that when a film costs more than the third world debt. Famous buildings get blown up, spaceships whizz around and everything is shiny and nice.. if only they'd bothered to put a story in there.<br /><br />Again, it's really annoying. With this money the producers could really have given us something to remember (a \\"Star Wars for our generation\\", as some dimwit before me put it) but it's just another in a depressingly long line of empty headed, expensive popcorn flicks for stupid people to whoop and cheer along to. Watch Mars Attacks instead - it's more realistic.<br /><br />(...)
B00005MP58|5.0|I first saw this fantastic miniseries when I was a freshman in highschool and have been in love with it ever since.  They setting, costumes, and characters were all chosen and cast to perfection.  I espescially loved Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy.  He is such a great actor and he makes you want to hate him for the way he is so snobbish, but yet you still feel sorry for him when Elizabeth rejects him.  Plus he is one sexy guy, and looks really good in his Regency Era clothes.  If you want further proof of what kind of hold this series has over people, my Dad will usually run from the room when he hears or sees anything lovey dovey. But with this movie he actually will sit down and ask about it.  The last time we watched it, he was the first one in front of the tv after dinner!  The only thing I have to say bummed me out was the fact that Jane Austen never wrote a sequel for us to enjoy!
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is such an endearing and lasting album for me.  I myself didn't really get into early 70's Bowie until I was in college, having been weaned on early MTV era Bowie.  Definitely now a constant in my life.  A solid listen all the way through.  The music is fantastic, and the lyrics are possibly some of the best Bowie ever wrote(next to Hunky Dory).  \\"We move like Valiums on Vasaline\\"...what a great line from \\"Hang Onto Yourself\\".  Or \\"Time takes a cigarette, Puts it in your mouth\\" from \\"Rock'n Roll Suicide\\".  I suppose I'm preaching to the converted.  It really is a classic rock album.  If you haven't gotten' a copy of it yet, you should.  The remastered version sounds good.  Everything feels more upfront with more breathing room for the instruments and especially Bowie's voice.  A worth wild purchase indeed.
0385510454|3.0|John Grisham's latest, \\"The Broker,\\" is the product of a tired man. In stark contrast to his early efforts, this book is thin on plot and characterization, and is really more of an Italian travelogue/language lesson than a thriller. All the time I was reading it I felt impatient and frustrated (I kept with it because it's not a bad book, just an uninspired one, and I had nothing else to read). \\"The Firm,\\" for all it's wooden prose and cardboard characters, was a much more thrilling read. I don't think he's put as much effort into a book since then.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|The DVD release I have to say is just awful. There is no english track of any kind given this movie was targeted to American audiences. The second thing the commentaries was in japanese. I'm sorry but the majority of everybody here speak english and even if we sushi, we still speak in American tongues. This movie probably would look better on the book shelf or with your super anime collections and thats probably it. Until Dreamworks re-release Ghost in the Shell 2 with an english then I'll buy it. Otherwise, Pass.
B0009S4IHY|2.0|Some of the visuals were good, but it got boring after 30 minutes.  Why people would give this four or five stars, makes absolutely no sense!  I wouldn't recommend it.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Again...Ridley Scott's artistry enjoys us very much. <br /> <br />Some of the main events in the era of the seven crusade wars which lasted for 200 years from 1099 AD to around 1290 or so in the muslim lands, those events of historical facts depicting the struggle between Christians and Muslims were fairly and honestly presented in the film. I think this film is the only film ever <br />to be honest for both Christians and Muslims in terms of faithful <br />presentation of historical facts. Of course, the movie can't show <br />everything of what had happened 900 years ago. You can read the  <br />history books of the crusades for more information... <br /> <br />The battles in the movie reminded me with the battle scenes of <br />Akira Kurosawa's Samurai films (Ran, Kagemusha,...etc), you just <br />sit and watch, enjoy and think.... <br /> <br />The cinematography, sound, and visuals were fabelous. <br /> <br />All the main and supporting characters were wonderfully acted in the film, specially of Ed Norton's voice of the king of Jerusalem, and the amazing Ghassan Massoud who played Saladin (Salah Al-Deen),this Syrian actor has amazed me for his determined and charismatic performance. He is a promenent Arab actor in the Arab world who played some arabic and islamic historical characters in TV miniseries. <br />Saladin ( who died around 1193 ) was and still the most important devote muslim, head of state, and military leader after the era of prophet Mohammed and his great companions  <br />(7th century AD) becasue Saladin had returned Jerusalem back to Muslims in 1187 AD and still made good relations with the Christians at those days and had offered them peaceful period <br />until his death. <br /> <br />This film is a nice journey to the history and the middle ages, <br />and still it has a contemporary message at the end of the film towards today's world events.....just make a peace, a just peace. <br /> <br />Honestly, when I've seen the film for the first timein  <br />California I was totally surprised during the showing and after <br />of how can this kind of film is shown in the west ?  <br />becasue it was fair to muslims and christians at the same time <br /> <br />I've seen the film 3 times already and I'm waiting to buy  <br />the DVD.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009L1TA|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be.  The ending was a big surprise!  Just see it for yourself, and you'll see why.  Not the Best military movie ever made, but definitely worth seeing.  It's also a bit confusing, but I enjoyed it, so will you.
0784010501|3.0|Even if you hate Madonna's music, like me (sorry, I'm a classic rock man), you can still enjoy this movie for the way it was filmed, especitally the black and white behind-the-scenes of her life during her 1990 tour.  You can simply skip the chapters of concert performances. <br /> <br />And besides, it's always great to watch Madonna act like a total slut!!!
B0000541AM|5.0|warriors )1979) is a fantastic film. The fight scenes are great. The movie is about an inner city gang trying to get home from a meeting.  there are many run-ins with their rivals. If you havent seen this film yet, check it out. The song \\"in the city\\" by Joe Walsh is in it and it puts a new perspective on the classic trak. this film is Strongly Reccomended
B00001ZULV|3.0|First of all, the moment the producers screw me with an edited version of a hit song simply for the sake of space, THAT'S ALL, you've lost me!  This is what's done with \\"ABACAB\\" and \\"MAMA\\"; two classic Genesis songs destroyed!  The second flaw is including the song \\"Congo\\", which was not even a hit.  I don't even remember who sang it in Phil Collins' place.    On the plus side, we get to hear a new version of \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" with Peter Gabriel reunited with his old band members.  Sadly, this never resulted in a reunion tour.    This is the only Genesis greatest hits package to date.  As an alternate, consider any of the live recordings, which will give you a great mix of their hits at the time they were recorded.
0780619951|1.0|This five-finger man gives this film 1 finger (guess which finger). Brando gives a performance unworthy of his oscar status, & Kilmer is either too stoned or too bored to even finish his lines. Not even Fairuza Balk's beauty or Stan Winston's exceptional effects could save this hairball of a flick. Someone call the vet 'cause this film deserves to be neutered. Bad doggy; the litter box is full; and yes the lion sleeps tonight - 'cause this movie put him into a coma.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Tom Waits, <br /> <br />Tom Waits, <br /> <br />This review comes way after the release of the CD; I just happened to be looking through Amazon reviews and wanted to see what the masses thought of this disc.  After reading every one of the 206 current reviews, I decided to contribute. <br /> <br />Tom Waits, <br /> <br />He has already transcended modern music with the style and grace of a 25 year history of brilliance.  When you created the ground you walk on and created what you are compared to, it is very difficult to judge that work.  I believe that all of his work now, is just a pure expression of whim, and creativity.  He does not make records for you or me; he makes them because they cannot, not be made.   <br /> <br />This opens the door to real listening of this record, and trying to grasp it, feel it as he does.   <br /> <br />As I musician, always aspire to write one song I would consider to be on Tom's level.  This is not an A!@ kissing, but a reality.   <br /> <br />Mule Variations, is poignant, understated compared to Bone Machine, and incredibly warm in its texture.  Compared to other work of his, it holds its own. While it is hard to replace Rain Dogs on the top of my list, I feel it comes close.   <br /> <br />The point here I believe was not to overwhelm the listener, but to show a new vision, one of Hope, Redemption, a prodigal son returning to his home.  <br /> <br />Pony- is right there.  I am in the boxcar next to this wayward traveler.  Who doesn't want to be in \\"Evelyn's kitchen\\". <br /> <br />Big in Japan- Satire? Venting?  Or just a good tune.  \\"I got the style not the grace\\" <br /> <br />Chocolate Jesus, the song makes me sweat; I swear the temperature goes up at least 10 degrees listening to that song, dustbowl Mississippi.  \\"Pour him over ice cream for a nice parfait.\\" <br /> <br />Pilipino Box Spring Hog- \\"ya gotta baste it with a sweeping broom\\", great rhythms, slightly askew <br /> <br />Come on up to the House- a tour de force with power and grace, AMEN  \\"all your crying don't do no good, come down off the cross we can use the wood.\\" <br /> <br />16 great songs, ageless and creative, raw and unyielding.  No rest for the weary, but to me there are 2 outstanding songs. <br /> <br />Cold Water- Simple and understated and the dam@ cowbell is out of time.  The great minimalist guitar sound, and then an intense solo.  The coolest part is it is 2 songs in one, the verses are so simple lyrically and then the breaks have this intense poetic feel.  \\"I am Reading a bible by a 40 watt bulb.\\"  WOW <br /> <br />Picture in a Frame- Well I am biased, I picked this as my wedding song, and sometimes it is just that important.  So simple again, I think the strength of this song comes from the overwhelming sense of raw non-communicative feelings.  \\"I wanna love you till the wheels come off\\" He realized there was a lack of better words and used the ones he felt, unreal.   <br /> <br />Summary- <br /> <br />All of his records will give you something new, something exciting and lyrical.  Mule Variations takes understatement forward, and then it can get very complex without losing the listener.  Listen, don't just hear, open up and be filled, then think, then tell me what you think of this record.  <br /> <br />P.S.  \\"What's he building in there? I'll tell you one thing he's not building a playhouse for the children.\\"
B000089A06|2.0|Was this siamese-prequel even necessary? Aren't there enough out there already? If you're interested in the pre-Lecter years then see 'Manhunter' - a far superior film. 2 stars ONLY because of Hopkin's performance. Edward Norton's portrayal of agent Will Graham is so weak and girlish you wish Lecter would have succeeded in killing him at the beginning. I guess Hannibal doesn't like quiche.
B00082IJ08|1.0|This is an extremely boring and monotone album.  There is no life in this music.
B00005JMEW|5.0|. . . 'cause I don't know what you're griping about. I've never had more fun watching a movie. An elixir of Sergio Leone and Kung Fu theatre, this film will bring back your faith in movie-making. Brilliant acting on all fronts, and a soundtrack unladened with the idiocy of hip-hop and bubblegum pop that so many other movies are going to in an attempt to cover up their uninspiring dialogues. A script that is as hilarious as it is brutal. Action-packed and never dull. Uma Thurman even comes out looking sexy as well as vicious. See it at all costs!
B00000JHAU|5.0|This is my first Belle and Sebastian CD.  At first I tried to understand the meaning of the lyrics, only to be confounded.  On a rational level some of them make no sense at all.  I believe that they are intentionally non-sensical (in a good way).  They are like dreams that evoke strong emotions though we cannot figure out the dream.  One is tempted to think of these songs as koans, in that they are meant to by-pass the intellect and go to the soul.  The CD cover is quite appropriate.  A nice-looking woman in a ponderous state has apparently put aside her Kafka book for a moment.  And so it is that this CD will stir up emotions (though it is neither morbid nor mellifluous) and thoughts about your life.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|The year is 1993. Glam metal and new wave are dead and grunge rules the charts. So what do Rush do about this dramatic shift in music tastes? They shift with it! While their previous effort Roll the Bones was a more mainstream album, one may worry that they would continue with the sound but the exact opposite occured. They go for an overall heavier sound and the results are terrific. The sound can be similar to alternative rock at times but don't worry, they're not turning into Pearl Jam. The keyboards are a lot less noticable on here. The main focus is the guitars,while the synths are kept in the background. They do pop up at times, but you will most likely have to keep an ear open for them. I love how Animate starts, with the whole \\"1..2..3..4\\" and then out of nowhere this six minute rocker starts up. The synths are upfront on this song but don't worry it doesn't ruin the song at all. Stick it Out is one of Rush's heaviest songs. The riffs remind me of Alice in Chains. Probably a grunge influenced sound. Nobody's Hero can bring a tear to the eye as it is about a friend that the band lost to AIDS. Some of Geddy's most emotional singing. Cut to the Chase,Everyday Glory,and The Speed of Love are nice melodic rockers that deserve a lot more mention. Geddy sounds creepy on Double Agent when he uses his speaking voice. Between Sun and Moon is a wonderful song, very rich in texture indeed. Alien Shore is a haunting song, i mean seriously, the guitar sound can send a shiver down your spine. Cold Fire would have fit on Roll the Bones, since it has that same pop sound that that album had. Leave That Thing Alone is an awesome instrumental with great synth sounds.  <br /> <br />Just as Rush changed with the 80s new wave sound, they are now changing with the 90s alternative sound. Like i said with Roll the Bones, every one of these songs deserves to be a hit,but alas no, it gets a lot of disrespect for some reason. I truly do not understand the deal with some of the negative reviews of this album as i feel it is a masterpiece. But oh well it is their loss, I am glad that I have the opportunity to listen to these great songs. Man 1993 was such a great year for music. When i see all the crap that everyone listens to nowadays, i simply long for these good old days....
B00003CY0V|3.0|Watching this movie makes you realise you will never have a bad hair day again, not compared to John Travolta anyway. Along with agreeing to be in more than his fair share of flop movies, his hair is dreadful. I think his wife should be sorting him out. In this, much like Pulp Fiction, he has an overly greasy bob - but he also has what looks like blonde highlights on top. Hello?! No, no, no. Shave it off and start again. Oh, I'm sorry, you've already done that and it looks worse?!<br /><br />This film has had more publicity about Halle Berry getting paid squillions for the flash of flesh than anything else. Frankly, not that impressed. She got paid how much for how little? Quite literally. Why guys drool, I have no idea. Anyone else think this was just for the guys, and to make guys go see it, considering there was so much publicity?<br /><br />Now onto the good points of the movie. Two words: Hugh Jackman. There's a fine speciman of a man. Apart from the hoop earring he sports in this. Again: no, no, no! I liked him as a Wolverine, and even have a poster of him up as Wolverine on my wall. And no, it's not just the leather that does it for me, as one guy suggested (unless he's willing to wear it, now there's an idea!), it's the whole look. I'm not keen on him in other films, he was alright in Van Helsing, but the hair was too long, and he was OK in this, just the earring. I'm very particular when it comes to my men. And was that a real tattoo?<br /><br />I found the storyline to be very complicated, although I managed to follow it just a little. I managed to understand what was going on. Look out for the absolutely stunning falling down a cliff scene - that blew me away!<br /><br />This film would not have worked with 9/11 and the recent London bombings 7/7, and was withdrawn from cinemas shortly after 9/11. There's mentions of terrorists, and scenes of exploding buildings, and the film in general will make you feel a little edgy due to this.<br /><br />Also look out for a number of stars in this: Tate Donovan appears (and dies); Vinnie Jones is thankfully silent nearly all the way through; Drea de Matteo (Joey's sister Gina) in a blink-and-you'll-think-you-saw-a-familiar-face-role and also, Ann, Sam & Margaret Travolta appear as hostages in scenes. Although you have to read the cast listing to find that out.<br /><br />This was quite an entertaining little film, and nearly made it to being a four-star review, just Halle Berry was unnecessary in this film, apart from being there to entertain the guys.so look out for a number of stars in this: Tate Donovan appears (and dies); Vinnie Jones is thankfully silent nearly all the way through; Drea de Matteo (Joey's sister Gina) in a blink-and-you'll-think-you-saw-a-familiar-face-role and also, Ann, Sam & Margaret Travolta appear as hostages in scenes.

B0000248L1|5.0|If you are a true thrash metal fan, then you will love having this album in your collection. This is metal to the core, nothing more and nothing less. A lot of people complain about Randy Rampage's voice, but i think it is awesome. Yes it can take some getting used to, but after a while, you have to admit that it fits the music. Crystal Ann is a nice acoustic intro that leads into the mid-paced thrasher Alison Hell. The whole album is filled with headbanging classics, like W.T.Y.D. and Ligeia. It all concludes with Human Insecticide, which is 100% speed metal. Any self-respecting metalhead will love this. To all you mallcore fans, steer clear,as this is true metal, not the homo garbage you call \\"heavy.\\"
6305657947|5.0|Anyone who has ever read the short stories by O Henry will understand the surprise twist ending at the end of this. The twist was so unbelievable! The way that it was shot, with the action and fast-paced music...it's indescribable through words. You've got to see this ending. I'd reccomend it for ANY movie fan.
078681859X|3.0|I picked this book up because it was a \\"While You're Waiting for Harry Potter\\" suggestion, and naturally, it doesn't compare. (But few kid's books do.) While some might find the characters Bartimaeus' snappy & sardonic manner amusing, the other main character, Nathaniel, was rather flat. <br /> <br />I had hoped that the story would be more transporting and imaginative than it was, and I found myself struggling to finish it. Even so, some kids might enjoy it.
B000957O82|5.0|Will Smith and Kevin James are AMAZING. Even though I enjoy watching Will Smith on any Action Movie, he just took my breath away with his charm but Kevin James just blew me out. I have seen him and actually loved him on the tv series King of Queens. He is an amazing, loveble and funny charecter and am so glad he made this step in to the Hollywood Movies.  <br /> <br />Is interesting how 2 people from different worlds, can actually make this wonderfull movie. I myself give it 2 thumbs up. I saw it in the theater and couldnt wait untill it came on DVD.
0689835604|5.0|This is a great book, I purchased this book when my daughter was 18 months and it's one of her favorite books (she has 3 favorite books).  She will pull the book from her book box and I will read it over and over again.  She knows where all her hands, mouth, eyes, hands, feet and belly button are.  It's a great book!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|For those who love Frank Sinatra and Harry Connick, Jr., Michael Buble is a real treat to listen to.  A fabulous voice, singing great, timeless music.  It's a CD that I can see getting heavy airplay in my car!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've seen live performances of \\"Phantom\\" three times. Once with Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. The movie, in it's own right was equally as entertaining. Each special in it's own way. No substitute for the chandelier crashing over your head in a live theater, but then looking a Gerard Butler makes up for it. His Phantom was frightening and powerful, making his obsession with Cristine intriguing. Genius casting of fairly unknowns. No baggage, no expectations, and you can let yourself fall into the story.
B00004VVN9|4.0|I have always been a big Natalie Wood fan and this was her last  <br />picture. She did a good job as did Christopher Walken and <br />Louise Fletcher. As a sci-fi flick it is better than average. <br />The special effects were okay, but just a little dated. <br />The concept of recording your every thought and feeling is <br />definitely a cut above virtual reality, although a little <br />scary. All in all a good movie. <br />
B0000VCZKW|4.0|I love Matilda (even though I'm 25.) It's a fun, whole family type of movie. It's not meant to be a serious discertation of world views or a oscar worthy film. It's just a great movie to watch if you have kids, and even if you don't have kids. There's no bad language (as far as I know, it's been a while since I've seen it), no blood or gore (does a fat kid messily eating chocolate cake count ?) and it makes you feel good all the way through. Now, on to the dvd. The extras look interesting and worthy of a special edition. I'd give the dvd the full five stars if it were truly a special edition if it has an anamorphic WIDESCREEN transfer as all movies should have and a commentary by Devito and/or Mara Wilson. Other than that, you should pick this up and just sell it when and if they ever release a correct aspect ratio version.
B00062RCBW|4.0|This will be not so much of a review of this specific DVD set as a general review of the actual TV series \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" itself.  Keep that in mind as you read further.  I say that because for potential buyers, DVD extras might influence one to spend the rather hefty bucks being asked to own the whole show, even though a lot of episodes in the final years are really not that good, in my view.<br /><br />The first 3 years of this 7 year long series are undoubtedly the best in my opinion, though there still WERE a few great episodes scattered among the final four years.  All things considered, this was undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi shows ever, period, but in general, the longer it ran, the worse it got.<br /><br />This decades in coming spinoff to the original Kirk-Spock version truly holds its own, and in many ways, exceeds the late 60's series, if only in that in a seven year run, there were simply more GOOD episodes than were seen in its genesis.  Still, there are many, many BAD ST:TNG episodes, or poor/below average, and it all came down to the writing.  The technical attributes (special effects/sets/production values) and achievements of the show were far beyond the original Star Trek series however, and remained consistently excellent throughout its entire run.  A minor carp in this was the seeming \\"video to film\\" nature of the SFX, but still, most of it was done excellently.<br /><br />Still, one has to wonder if the original Star Trek series had 7 years, instead of 3, whether the original would've been better than ST:TNG.  And there were the first four excellent feature films based upon the original, which might even things out in general when comparing the two versions overall.<br /><br />ST:TNG, as was the original series, was best when it stuck to the opening credits, \\"...To seek out new life and new civilizations, and to boldy go where nobody has gone before...\\"  In other words, episodes dealing with the \\"unknown\\" out there deep in space, were always high points for this series.<br /><br />Sadly, great and original and mind-blowing sci-fi ideas were confined to only a small portion of the ST: TNG series as a whole, especially in the last four years.  As with the awful (imho) followup series \\"Deep Space Nine\\" and \\"Enterprise,\\" too often, Star Trek: The Next Generation sunk into meaningless, boring, and trivial stories about Troi's mother or Worf's son.  Such became merely sci-fi soap opera and did NOT live up to the potential of this series shown during the early years.  There were also completely silly and boring, waste of time episodes involving android Mr. Data (ironically, the most interesting and compelling character on the show) playing Sherlock Holmes or other members of the cast in similar \\"Holodeck\\" created, mundane and indulgent, unimaginative \\"period\\" stories, most of which were dull and uninspiring.<br /><br />Again, the best moments of this particular series dealt with the WRITING and with IDEAS.  Some were quite mindblowing and deserving of much thinking and afterthought, like \\"Tin Man,\\" and \\"Remember Me.\\"  Others, which again dealt with long, silly episodes involving Troi's mother or Worf's son, or many of the Klingon dominated shows full of ridiculous and long-winded Klingon traditions and \\"culture,\\" were and still are, rather lame.<br /><br />Overall, I would break this series down as follows:<br /><br />10 percent  Excellent shows<br />20 percent  Very good shows<br />40 percent  Acceptable shows<br />20 percent  Poor shows<br />10 percent  Very poor shows<br /><br />When the writing was true to Gene Roddenberry's original vision, and when he was still alive and basically in control of the show, ST:TNG was the golden age of anything and everything STAR TREK.  Though spinoffs \\"Deep Space\\" and \\"Enterprise\\" were and always will remain comparatively bad to me, \\"Star Trek: Voyager\\" for awhile was pretty good and the reason again was because it stuck to the theme of \\"strange new worlds\\" and \\"exploration\\" of the unknown.  This has always been true of any good sci-fi, and when this show stuck to that idea, it was great.  When it sunk into sci-fi soap opera instead however, it was pretty much a waste of time.  Unfortunately, in the last few years, this was the case more often than not.<br /><br />All in all, because in general, MOST supposed \\"sci-fi\\" TV series efforts have been pretty awful, with some noted exceptions like \\"Twilight Zone\\" and \\"Outer Limits,\\" while I'd like to give this ENTIRE series overall a 3 rating, I'll be generous here and give it a 4.  This is simply because the truly great, original and thought-provoking episodes of ST:TNG more than make up for the too numerous Troi's mother/Worf's son type episodes, the ones in other words, where the writers and producers were obviously just \\"phoning it in.\\"ci-fi, and when this show stuck to that idea, it was great.

B000002H6C|4.0|... are complete and utter morons who deserve a steel-toed boot to the head.    Out of all of the Metallica albums, this probably receives the most mixed reviews. First off, you have the nay-sayers who are attacking this album's production values and supposed absence of the bass guitar, these people are effing retards. Despite what the MTV/TRL pop crowd says, the production is the best i'v ever heard from them in overall qaulity verses heaviness AND you CAN hear the bass; ever hear that stange \\"buzzing\\" sound in the songs on \\"Justice\\"? yup, thats Jason's bass. Also take into consideration that this came out after what is quite possibly one of the most overrated albums of all-time, \\"Master Of Puppets\\", so it would be naturally hard for \\"Justice\\" to be as popular as it's older brother.     Then there is the crowd that actually knows something and agrees that \\"... And Justice For All\\" is by far the greatest album Metallica ever put out. I agree, i think this absolutly kills \\"Master Of Puppets\\", technically, lyrically and artistically. Even though it hinted their future venture into the commercial realm with the bands first music vido \\"One\\", and many complain that this was where Metallica first drew up the blueprint for selling out, i have always maintained that there was no way that they could of topped this, i kind of expected the \\"Black Album\\" to be a softer, maintsteam affair.     Please, stop comparing this to MOP, sure, it may not have Cliff, but since when was bass THAT important anyway? it is no more then a support instrament, i play it myself and realize this. It's all about the guitars folks, this is heavy metal, not swing jazz. You will find Hammett and Hetfeild at the absolute best in their entire careers right here. And for the morons hoping this will get remasted, expecting this to have some miracle improvment in sound... please, just shut up now... you can't improve a recording that was recorded 17 years ago or any time for that matter... remastering is the biggest gimmick in the recording buissness, they simply sound a notch \\"louder\\" and thats it, it is a lame attempt from record companies to make gullible people pucha$e albums they already own.    Anyway, this is Metallica's best album, period. Every song here is perfect, it is almost like a compostion, the 10 minute title track alone is worth the price. The lyrics are brimming with anger and intelligence and they are delivered witfully with James's snarls and growls. And despite what some people say about Lars, he is a talented drummer, just listen to his skin-work on this thing... it's mind-blowing.     I almost forgot... to the guy below me... who the hell are you? Jason Newsted was/is a phenomenal bassist. You can't compare him to Cliff really, it is unfair because they have completely differant styles of playing. I know that Cliff Burton is more popular, but still... to call Jason's playing \\"mediocre\\" is just ignorant and downright foolish. I would like to see you play better then Jason! Infact he was incredablely under-utilized in Metallica i think, he is an exellent songwritter, just listen to the first two Flotsam Jetsam albums, he wrote a majority of the songs on those two albums before being recruitted by Metallica.
0385336810|3.0|The creator of our favorite shopaholic brings us Emma Corrigan, marketing assistant for the Panther Corporation.  Emma has had a bit of trouble finding her way in the world, and this is the third career she's tried.  It seems to be going nowhere, as evidenced by the disastrous meeting she attends in Glasgow.  Things get even worse when her plane home hits turbulence and she blurts out all of her secrets to the man sitting next to her, who turns out to be the owner of the Panther Corporation, Jack Harper.  At first, Jack makes her nervous, but the more they bump into each other (or Jack seeks her out), the more the bond between them grows, and pretty soon they're a hot, though secret, item.  Emma is sure she's got the perfect romance until Jack's carelessness with her secrets turns her world upside down, and she feels used and betrayed.  Jack's got a lot of work to do to win her back!<br /><br />Though not quite as engaging as the Shopaholic books, this was a fun, light read with heartwarming characters and some good humor.  Emma's obnoxious cousin and coworkers get their proper comeuppance, and the good guys win.  This is a nice, light romantic fantasy in the time-honored British tradition.
0316172324|2.0|Blink claims to explore the power of \\"rapid cognition\\" and \\"snap judgments\\" i.e. - intuition and gut feelings. <br /> <br />The book starts promisingly enough, but it's unwilling to take a stand on rapid cognition and snap judgments, and their usefulness in life. In fact, the author basically concludes that snap judgments are sometimes good, sometimes bad. In otherwords, he's unable to make a judgment. <br /> <br />I was given the book by a friend who thought it would help me make better decisions, but the fact is Gladwell spends little if any time discussing how rapid cognition can help us in our daily lives. <br /> <br />Worse, the author (who's half of African descent) spends much of the book discussing the problems of snap judgments in the context of discrimination against African Americans. Racism is a terrible thing, but that's not the advertised focus of this book. If you buy this book, you'll spend a lot of time and money hearing this author's manifesto on the ill-treatment of African Americans.  <br /> <br />Finally, the book also discusses the concept of \\"thin-slicing,\\" and indeed this book appears to be thin-sliced. For what is a fascinating topic, the author only skims the surface, and the result is a short book with relatively few words per page. I almost get the feeling he was rushing out the door to his next NYC cocktail party. <br /> <br />If you're considering buying this book, I suggest you make a \\"snap judgment\\" not to.
019280264X|5.0|Jane Austen describes Mansfield park to have happened in the first two decades of 1800's.  The uniqueness in the novel is the fact that Jane remains consistently and continuously truthful to the story.  The story is about Fanny Price, the heroine, who happens to be Lord & Lady Bertram's niece.  Fanny's parents are on the lower end of the economy, and therefore Fanny gets taken in by her uncle and aunt at the age of 10.  Over the years of Fanny's stay at Mansfield Estate, she becomes more open, intellectual, virtuous and graceful.  She grows into a beautiful woman who is genuinely liked by everybody.  Like any great story, Mansfield Park has a good guy (Edmund & Sir Thomas Bertram), a bad guy (Mrs. Norris), the temptress (Mary Crawford) and the trickster (Henry Crawford).<br /><br />Over the years, Fanny falls in love with Edmund (her first cousin) who reminds her of the comfort she received by her biological brother - William.  Whether or not Fanny and Edmund will end up together is the constant question that keeps the novel engaging.  In terms of the love complex of the novel, it is more like an open-ended square than a triangle. Henry loves Fanny, who loves Edmund, who loves Mary Crawford.  Other than the obvious incestuous implication in Fanny affection towards Edmund and Edmund's obsession w/ Fanny's disposition - the novel is socially very truthful to the materialism of then England.  Jane throws in a harsh comparison between Fanny's mother and aunt's households towards the last part of the novel when Fanny returns to her family for a few months.  Jane also draws contrasts between Mansfield and London cultures by showing changes in personalities of Mary & Henry Crawford.<br /><br />Fanny practices about Edmund, what Jane says in Emma - \\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more.\\"
B000784WMW|5.0|Oh, I love the book Jane Eyre!  I read it for the first time in 7th grade and it has stayed on the top of my list ever since.  And this  film version is the best one there is.  It is true to the story and the actors and settings are just right!  When I read the book again I see these characters in my mind's eyes.  While it is long, it is a great film nonetheless.  If you are tired of movies that don't do the book justice, this is the one for you.  It definately does the book justice and never tire of watching it!
B0007KTAU4|5.0|...and how she does it. It would be fair to say that the whole CD is engaging. Not only ranges from jazz, to blues and folk, but the lyrics are fairly good too. Although Bruni sings about love, she outweighs women control in almost every one of her songs. I especially like \\"L'excessive\\", \\"Le Ciel Dans Une Chambre\\" which its last part switches from French to Italian, \\"Le Plus Beau Du Quartier\\" and \\"J'en Connais\\". <br />If you would like to listen to a neat combination of rhythms, an interesting voice and songs that actually say something, then search no more.
B0000019PA|3.0|Yes, this album has some catchy guitar.  Yes, the lyrics are pretty good at times.  But it is NOT the jaw-dropping masterpiece it has been made out to be.  This band, along with The Pixies, Pavement, and Guided by Voices (you know what kind of indie-rock fan I am) is one of the most overated ever.  Decent, but not stellar, album.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Looking at reviews for Slipknot albums, it seems that you either love them or hate them. Those who love, the maggots, are those who will support them until death. Those who hate are those who can't stand nu-metal and make their point very vocally in their one star reviews. I'll state my opinion right away, I love Slipknot. That comment alone is bound to get my name put in the anti-Slipknot reviews as an example of \\"one of the dumb Slipknot fans.\\" Fine, stone me for having an opinion, I'll move on. I know how theres so many sub genre's of metal these days (nu, black, death, swedish, industrial..etc.) but I hate labels. If it's metal, thats what I'll call it, no need for a name in front of it just because of sound differences. <br /> <br />Now for this album. I have all three Slipknot albums (yes i know, M.F.K.R. but god that thing is like a ghost its so hard to find). With S/T you got a lot of loud, mosh pit inducing anthems. With Iowa, you got the loudest, angriest, stressball album around. With Subliminal Verses however, you get something new that Slipknot rarely shows in other albums, variation. With each song you get something else. No, \\"Blister Exists\\" and \\"Three Nil\\" don't sound completely different, but they each bring something different. <br /> <br />1. Prelude 3.0 - 9/10 The cocktease of the album. When you hear this song you wonder what CD you have just bought. Slow, mellow, and a definate change, this song makes you think Slipknot slowed down everything. <br />2. Blister Exists - 10/10 Theres the Knot. This song pulsates with riffs and drums. Right away you get reeled in with Corey's voice melted into Mick and James' guitars. <br />3. Three Nil - 9/10 Another fast and heavy delivery. I love when the song switches tempo to the \\"GOODBYE!\\" <br />4. Duality - 10/10 If you haven't heard this song, you live under a rock. This song was the anthem of this album. Yes, it was on the radio, and yes you probably saw the video, sue them. Its a great song and shouldn'tbe avoided. <br />5. Opium of the People - 9/10 The intro sounds like it came from the 80's, but soon enough you're whipped back into the Slipknot sound. The riff at the break of the song still gives me goosebumps. <br />6. Circle - 10/10 - A complete 180, Slipknot acoustic. Those are 2 words you never thought would be put together. One of the most surprising tracks on this album because its a new turn for them, yet they pull it off incredibly well. <br />7. Welcome - 8/10 - Just an all out bashing here, loud lyrics, loud guitar, just alot of loud. <br />8. Vermillion - 9/10 This song really shows how much emotion the band can put into their work. You can really feel with Corey when the \\"Won't let this build up inside of me\\" comes along. Really powerful. <br />9. Pulse of the Maggots - 10/10 Usually fan tribute songs are a little lame. This one rules. The air raid you here in the beginning makes you realize you're in for a ride with this song. <br />10. Before I Forget 20/10 - Without a doubt my favorite off this record, from beginning to end. The riff is awesome, the lyrics are great and the chorus practically makes you pump your fist. <br />11. Vermillion pt 2 - 9/10 Another acoustic track that Slipknot, again, pulls off. It has different lyrics than Part 1, but these seem to come more from the heart. <br />12. The Nameless - 9/10 - A mix of heavy and gritty verses and a slower toned down chorus. Through this song, you really feel that there is no limit to their ability, because they take an almost pop-like chorus and still give it enough Slipknot feel to it to make it dark <br />13. Virus of Life - 8/10 - A slow, creepy song that shows reflections of \\"Prosthetics\\" from their S/T. <br />14. Danger Keep Away - 10/10 An aggressive title to a rather slow and mellow song. A lot of people don't really like this song, but i really enjoy it. It sounds like the Prelude but calmer. It's a good finish to the album. <br /> <br />So there you have it, I thought this album was great. Take it for what it's worth. This review can either help you decide whether or not to get this album, or be an example to use in an anti-Slipknot review. Either way, I stand by my opinion

B000002UAU|1.0|Sorry to offend all you Beatles loving Hippies, but the truth must be told!  The Beatles are the most overhyped, overrated, annoying band in history.  Songs like these take no talent to play, they take no talent to perform, and they take no talent to compose. <br /> <br />Formulaic and uninspired, the Lennon/McCartney partnership has concocted some of the most simplistic, uncreative, insipid melodies ever commited to vinyl.  I've often heard their music described as \\"simple\\", but I think \\"simple minded\\" would be a more accurate description.  After all, simplicity can be a good thing.  But the Lennon/McCartney partnership didn't write any songs that were simple in a good way.  Rather, they wrote songs that were just plain simple minded, both musically and lyrically.  Twelve barre song structures, redundant three chord riffs, and some of the most brainless lyrics imaginable: <br /> <br />\\"She loves you <br />Yeah yeah yeah <br />She loves you <br />Yeah yeah yeah <br />She loves you <br />Yeah yeah yeah\\" <br /> <br />Wow!  The creativity really was rolling on that song!  As you can see, the Lennon/McCartney writing team draws heavilly from the classics, such as \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\", and \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" for their stunning lyrical complexity!  What ever caused their brilliant minds to think of those words!?  Sheer lyrical genius! <br /> <br />Can't you people put aside your nostalgia and start seeing The Beatles for what they really were?  They were nothing more than a juvenile acting, silly looking, musically amateurish garage band----hand picked at random out of a hundred other no talent bands----and forced upon an unsuspecting public by a bunch of fat, balding, cigar smoking record company executives in suits and ties.  The fact that a corporate marketing scam like The Beatles remains so massively popular thirty five years after they disbanded is a testament to the power of marketing.  If you pay good money for a Beatles album, than you my friend, are a sucker.  Just like all their fans were back in the 60s!  I think PT Barnum put it best----\\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\"  And I bet even today's suckers being born right now are going to grow up to become Beatles fans!

B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard about Green Day, and how popular they were, I wondered what could be so great about them. Now that I have listened to the album American Idiot, I know.  <br /> <br />One of the things that I think makes a song good is if it has a catchy tune or chorus--one that will get stuck in your head and leave you humming it for the rest of the day. Every song on American Idiot fits this criteria. My favorite songs are Holiday, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and American Idiot (why do the other reviewers hate it so much???) From the very first time I heard these songs on the radio, I found them so catchy that I wanted to hear them again. And again, and again.  <br /> <br />And that's just what I've done.
0975991477|4.0|Having had the pleasure of hearing Bruce Lipton speak about these topics, I knew pretty much what I was in for with the book.  But having all of this information in book form is invalueable, as it will reach so much further.  I loved being reintroduced to the idea that belief has much (if not all) to do with our wellbeing in this world.  This is something I have believed for a long time and it is certainly nice to have some scientific proof to validate it.  Anyone who is ready to consider stepping away from the medical/pharmaceutical model of healthcare should absolutely read this book. <br /> <br />I do however have one complaint.  There was not enough covered on how to reprogram the subconscious, especially if most hinderances to change are entwined with subconscious beliefs not matching conscious beliefs.  I did find a very brief reference at the very back of the book that mentioned Psych-K and suggested it as the way to achieve the lacking balance which would allow belief to shift.  I must surmise that Psych-K is the only thing Bruce Lipton finds effective, because nothing else was offered.  I happen to disagree and wish that Dr. Lipton had covered more extensively, other ways to affect change in the subconscious mind.  I feel like this would have been a much better book if as much time had been given to offering solutions as was given presenting problems.  I was left feeling like I had watched a movie that climaxed minutes before the movie ended, leaving little time for an appropriate resolution.
B000AARKOO|3.0|This is an interesting story. Like all interesting fictional stories set against a historical background, you have to suspend your reality beliefs and just enjoy the movie. The historical reality of this movie is lacking. Saladan was as bloodthirsty as anybody in that time frame, and the Christians were not less peaceful than the Muslims. They had actually improved the economy so much that the Islamic population around the Crusader states significantly increased from 1099 though the late 1200's. So the story of Ibelin helping build his lands up to be a reasonable facsimile of civilisation is in this distorted reality almost a true story in that respect.<br />A falsehood is that the caravan that the sister of Saladin was in was raided and she was killed. Instead it really went around the Crusader states much farther away from them, and with a large military escort, so that it would not be raided. Indeed, it was not raided. The scene in the movie is pure fabrication. Caravans were raided, but not this one. Also, Caravan raiding is portrayed as a bad thing for Christians to do. When the Prophet Muhammad raided caravans, for no reason other than plunder and loot, it was perfectly ok that people were killed, but not if anyone else, like Christians, did it.<br />Ibelin did participate in the battle of Hattin, which the Christians lost. He and his cavalry (knights) charged through the Muslim line and escaped the slaughter. The movie does show the cut off heads of the Christians, but it does not show how Saladin had the Radical Islamists with his army slaughter them one at a time in front of him. The great glee with which they did this while shouting \\"Allahu Akbar\\" is an indication to the apaologists that this was just a part of the 500 years of Jihad that preceeded the Crusades, 200 years of Jihad during the Crusades, and the 700 years of Jihad against Christianity since then.<br />Anyone who doesn't want to watch this well made and exciting movie as fiction needs to read \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the crusades)\\" by Robert spencer before seeing this movie. This book can be purchased on Amazon.com. Reading the book will inure the viewer to the historically insulting innaccuries, and will allow the viewer to suspend his imagination and truly enjoy this otherwise excellent film.<br />The siege scene before the walls of Jerusalem is probably more of what went on than what actually happened, but it is still an exciting and superbly crafted sequence.<br />Ridley Scott is a fantastic writer and director, and all of his movies need to be watched and enjoyed solely as the fantastic fiction that they are.itically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the crusades)\\" by Robert spencer before seeing this movie.

B0009KA7BS|3.0|For fans of the comic book on which this movie is based -- \\"John Constantine: HELLBLAZER\\" -- it will doubtless be a disappointment. I myself am an avid reader of said comic, and when I think of how much better the movie could have been...SHOULD have been...it makes me a little sad. For one thing, the John Constantine of the comic lives in London, not Los Angeles, and this is a critical difference, both for the character and the story. Constantine is supposed to be British through and through, and turning him into an American -- even worse, a Californian -- just destroys the whole foundation of the character. Putting a gun (a crucifix gun?) in his hand puts the final nail in this coffin...the John Constantine I used to read about never used guns.  He never had to.<br /><br />The storyline they chose to adapt is one of the best of the whole series, the \\"Dangerous Habits\\" story in which Constantine, a lifelong smoker, is diagnosed with lung cancer, and spends the rest of the story wrapping up his affairs on Earth before taking the trip he knows he is destined for.  The movie adaptation, however, borrows only slightly from this story and then throws a bunch of predictable Hollywood crap into it to botch it up. It looks like they tried to mix the subtleties of \\"Hellblazer\\" with the over-the-top action of \\"Blade,\\" and the result is a hodge-podge mix of horror and action which really doesn't fly -- at least, not in terms of what John Constantine's followers from the comics might expect. \\"Hellblazer\\" is, in the end, a character-driven story more than an action story, and there's precious little character to be found in the film. And, if you know and love John Constantine as I do, the last shot of the film will leave you, as it did me, cursing at the screen in rage.<br /><br />Taken on its own, if I ignore the comic for a few moments, the film isn't a bad one.  The effects are well-done, and the story clips along nicely.  The visions of Hell were detailed and gruesome, and I appreciated the effort that went into them.  Keanu doesn't fully convey the nature of the lead character, but he also doesn't lapse into his usual lazy style -- not a single \\"whoa\\" moment to be found in the whole movie!  The real star, for me, was Rachel Weisz, as Angela.  She pretty much stole every scene she was in, and was clearly the better actor of the two leads.  Another highlight in terms of acting was Tilda Swinton as the Archangel Gabriel, trapped on Earth and giving Constantine advice on how to redeem himself.  Swinton lends a cold, androgynous quality to the angel which was quite remarkable.  There are also a few really good \\"gotcha\\" moments, especially for Constantine, moments when his character did glimmer through a bit.<br /><br />Basically, \\"Constantine\\" is a good action movie with horror overtones.  Those going to see it expecting nothing more than this will likely be pleased.<br /><br />However, those seeing it hoping for a decent adaptation of the comic book are going to be let down in a big way. This Constantine has an American accent, he uses lots of guns, and he isn't as blithe or as harsh as he could be.  In short, he's not OUR Constantine.<br /><br />And that last shot in the film...oh, I could just spit fire over that one.nd I appreciated the effort that went into them.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|Being a big fan of metal (nu-metal is only metal in name), I love all types of bands in the genre: Dream Theater, Guns N Roses, Savatage, Opeth, Nevermore, etc. I had heard of Maiden (I'm only 18), was mildly interested until I heard people describe them as \\"lame fantasy metal\\" and \\"cartoonish metal.\\" Finally I gave in and bought Dance of Death despite the terrible cover (although I don't see why so many people criticize the name). I'll give my thoughts on it soon. <br /> <br />First off though, the music is actually somewhat different than their earlier stuff (I've since bought most of the early and Dickinson solo stuff). Gone are the sonic textures of albums like \\"Somewhere in Time,\\" the galloping bass of their earlier albums is still there, but not as prominent. The focus is on the epic songs; most of the songs are over five minutes. I love the way they set up their epics, with a slow beginning with clean guitars, which explodes into a heavy middle section, with the song slowing down again at the end with clean guitars; a great outro to make the song stick in your head. <br /> <br />1. Wildest Dreams 7/10- I hate it when bands include a \\"count\\" before the start of the song (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4...) and it actually hurts this song's grade. Although this short song is nothing spectacular, it has a good melody, but that count in the beginning of the songs makes me dock a point. <br />2. Rainman 9/10- Reminds me of \\"Flight of Icarus\\" off of \\"Piece of Mind\\" not because it is a ripoff, but is able to be a really good song, even though it is relatively short. Great guitar solo in the middle. <br />3. No More Lies 9.5/10- The first of several really good epics on this disc. The chorus is slightly too repetitive, though, which is why it didn't get a \\"10.\\" <br />4. Montsigur 7/10- Many Maiden fans consider this to be the \\"old school\\" song on the album. I didn't think that it was that great, but don't get me wrong, this is in no way a weak or filler song. <br />5. Dance of Death 9/10- This song is over eight minutes long and is great musically, but is hampered by some fairly weak, somewhat cheesy lyrics. The guitar soloing in the middle is fantastic. <br />6. Gates of Tomorrow 8/10- Not really a bad song, but there's not much of a difference between this song, \\"Wildest Dreams,\\" and \\"New Frontier\\" besides the lengths. <br />7. New Frontier 8/10- Not bad, but doesn't stick out. <br />8. Paschendale 10/10- By far the best song on the album, this epic is about a battle in WWI. One of the few Maiden songs to have a memorable crunchy riff. Some of the best soloing on the album can also be found in the middle. For those of you that already own this, I found myself unconsciously raising my fist in the air when the eagle cries near the middle of the song. <br />9. Face in the Sand 10/10- Has a nearly 2:00 instrumental intro, but I like the lyrics. The musicianship is supurb as well. <br />10. Age of Innocence 4/10- Weakest song on the album, makes me reach for the \\"skip\\" button each time. <br />11. Journeyman 7/10- I'll admit my grade is biased because I am more of a fan of Maiden's heavier stuff, but the focus here is on Dickinson's vocals. The quality of his voice definitely has not declined at all; in fact, I like how he sounds now even more than how de sounded in the \\"Piece of Mind\\" era. <br /> <br />I own a couple of Maiden's 80's albums and enjoyed them a lot, but I don't see how some of the fans from that era can dislike this album so much. They sound basically the same (I think it would be cool if they experimental with a seven-string), but there is no real \\"pop\\" element to the bands sound. Like I said before, the majority of the songs are over five minutes; and most of them are epics, showing an evolution, even though they still include plenty of solos (which I think is great, since many bands like Fates Warning, Metallica, and Queensryche have pretty much stopped). I can't see any reason why any Maiden fan reading this would not be ableto enjoy this, although if you are curious about getting into Maiden, I would suggest \\"Powerslave\\" or something like that.
B000058T5E|5.0|I know many great guitar players, too many to tell, but Jeff Beck is one of the biggest an oldest ones. These guy stands together with Page, Hendrix, Blackmore, Gilmour, Clapton... all the old school kick ass players. The thing that makes him particulary great is the fact that I'm buying hes NEW music. Face it, besides claptom (and those who are dead of course) he is the ONLY one keeping it fresh, original and just as good as it used to be. <br /> <br />I dont know if I have the right to say anything about Beck. I'm not really interested in hes old music, I met him in Who Else!! and been a fan frome that point foward. <br /> <br />The man really shines as a true artist and as a Guitar God / Hero / Legend / Who else man!. Once again, to be in the same list as the people a mentioned earlier, that counts in my book.

Not the 'end-all-tarot-deck', but a decent consideration for begginers. <br /> <br />P.S.- As a result of the Tennessee public school system, my spelling is terrible, so please over look any spelling or gramatical errors.

B0002Z0EYA|3.0|This movie was made for Hollywood,but not for History at all.  Petroculos was Achilles lover not his cousin, they left out the seen where Achilles was dressed as a women by his mother so he could be kept alive, and the fact that this war lasted 10 years, not like the movie tried to present it in 10 days.  Still there were some goood points that had much accuracy. Fo example, the one line wher Brad Bit says \\"Men don't make a pact with wolves,\\" is very accurate. Also when Achilles dragged Hectors body.  In the end this movie is very entertaining, but when looking for facts, open the book.
0312995423|4.0|I have just finished reading some of the other customer reviews on this book, and it seems that 95% of them have \\"not accurate\\" as their major complaint. This may be true, but is it worth giving the book one star purely because of this? Maybe I'm just naive, but the plot seemed pretty believable to me.  <br /> <br />I suppose the characters weren't as well developed as they could have been, although I found them somewhat interesting. I thought Susan was a fairly shallow character, but I did like David Becker and Strathmore. <br /> <br />This is an extremely fast-paced story with lots of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. I thought the final outcome was pretty clever, and enjoyed hearing about the technology--even if it wasn't \\"accurate\\".  <br /> <br />All in all a good quick-read sci fi/thriller that at the very least leaves you satisfied.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This CD is an absolute gem! Madeleine Peyroux is such a tremendous singer, with a range of emotions that hits you right where it counts. And even though she reminds me a little of Billie Holliday, she is very much her own person when it comes to singing. She is not an imitator or a phony in any sense of the word. The reason why this CD is such a classic is due to having just the right combination: a wonderful singer, great material (every song is strong), the best musicians and a famous producer. The songs on this CD will stick in your head long after you finish hearing it. My only regret is that I had to wait so long to hear another one of her CD's. I would give \\"Careless Love\\" 10 stars if I could! This collection of songs is a sure bet and would be a welcome addition to your music library.
0895260131|5.0|I'm amazed by the people low-rating this book with fallacious arguments; I even wonder if they read it. They talk a lot about mistakes and inaccuracies, but fail to point them... <br /> <br />So, to get things straight: I'm no \\"right wing\\", no christian, no american even. But after 9/11 I began reading a lot on Islam - not because of the terror strike, actually, but because I perceived a \\"gap\\" between the acts of some muslims and the \\"Islam is a religion of peace \\" media talk. <br /> <br />I first read the Quran, and was quite appalled; I checked the verses I found terrible in different english & french translation: no point, the substance of the text was the same. In order to understand better, I read some more (islamic documents such as Hadiths, Sira, Tafsirs, Fiqh manuals, and books from some authors such as Ibn Warraq, Bernard Lewis, + french ones, + history books, + a lot of web sites - from islamists to reformists or secular \\"muslims\\"). Now I'm sure of something: there might be moderate muslims, but Islam IS NOT moderate - those \\"good\\" muslims are actually bad ones according to the dogma, and that's a religion I prefer not to see around me until it has reformed a lot of things! <br /> <br />So... About the \\"PIG to Islam...\\": I didn't actually learn a lot in it, because apparently I already knew quite a lot. But Mr Spencer's work is a very good one in terms of popularization. If you wish to learn \\"basics\\" about islam, that's a great book, and there're quite a lot of other readings suggested. \\"Oversimplified\\", as some reviewer puts it? maybe.... but that's the point, ain't it, in a 200-pages book? If people want to know more, well they just have to \\"dig\\" more... <br /> <br />I just wish we had such a book in the french-speaking world....

B00005YUPO|3.0|I purchased this DVD along with Baby mozart of the Baby Einstein Series, when my son was about 7 or 8 months old and my first though was, \\"oh my God, how weird!\\" but then i saw my son paying attention to the video, and smiling sometimes, so i gave it a try, he likes this video a lot, but he likes others much more, like Baby Mc Donnald, Numbers Nursery, Language Nursery, Shakespeare, etc and that is only from the Baby Einstein series, there are so many more educational videos, that will teach your child new things, that is true they will eventually learn without the videos, but the videos will make it faster, I am not a teacher, I am just a mom that wants the best for her 14 month old baby boy.  <br />So i would recommend this video for variety, it is good yes, but there are better.
B00004RJ74|1.0|I watched this movie knowing a bit about it. Two guys end up going to a bar with vampires, thats about all I knew. The first half of this movie really pulled me in. It was cool and the acting was smooth and funny at times. The first half of the plot was simple enough to keep me watching. But then, outta nowhere vampires show up at the bar their at. Why? There is no explanation until the very end, we're just supposed to sit here and think, \\"Oh hey, vampires...interesting.\\" There are no \\"rumors of vampires\\" or urban legands that they hear, nothing, it just happens. And everyone seems to be not shocked. They're just like \\"Uh oh, better start killing them.\\" Are you kidding, if i saw a vampire i'd sh*t my pants. It was an interesting mix of that action/horror had it only been tied together a little better. If the one genre bled onto the other one then i probably would have enjoyed this movie better. However, its just as seperated as Part 1 and Part 2, you can almost see the split in film as it turns from action to horror. It had alot of premise, but just couldn't hold it together in the end
B000002UB6|3.0|Sometimes I feel it's a pity that this album was realeased. I mean, ABBEY ROAD was to be The Beatles last album. It was such a perfect summary for the groups career, ending ABBEY ROAD with singing: \\"And in the end, the love you take i equal to the love you make\\". But LET IT BE is still a pretty good album. It's just that it feel as it was realeased in the wrong time, better if it'd been realeased before ABBEY ROAD. <br /> <br />I don't really like Phil Spectors part on this album. The muddy \\"wall of sound\\" production just doesn't fit with those songs, niether with The Beatles for that part. The idea of the album was that no effects should be used. Only \\"straight\\" recordings, just like in their early days. Spector's strings, horns, trumpets, \\"angle backing vocals\\" and things like that destroys this original idea.  <br /> <br />But, as I said before, LET IT BE still is a great album. It contains some very nice songs, for example the kinda philosophic \\"Dig A Pony\\", the beautiful \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", the spacy \\"Across The Universe\\" and the classics \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Let It Be\\". Not to forget the rocking \\"I've Got A Feeling\\", which once again proves that Lennon and McCartney wrote their best songs when they were writing together. <br /> <br />But if you want LET IT BE, I think you should skip the original album and instead buy the realative new-realeased LET IT BE...NAKED. This one shows how LET IT BE was meant to be, without Spector's overdubs on the songs. NAKED replaces two of the original tracks, \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\", with one new, \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", which is much better than the other two songs together. <br /> <br />I give LET IT BE three stars, but I would probably give five to the NAKED version. So if you want a better album, designed as The Beatles wanted it and without the muddy Spector sounds (especially \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" sounds much better), you should buy the latter.
B000059XUO|4.0|In a day when we're getting an overload of super hero movies left and right, The Crow still stands near the top. As much as i enjoy a good super hero movie, i personally like the darker ones the best. Spiderman was pretty good, but too cheery for me. The darker movies tend to rely more on imagery and power than an overload of special effects. Some of the hero movies try to be dark but end up crappy (Daredevil). Personally, the best to pull it off are a select few of the Batmans (Begins, 1 and 2) and this. The best scenes of this movie are those that have little or no dialogue. Not saying that any time someone talks it ruins the movie, its just the way that the imagery takes over. The look that Brandon Lee gives himself as the Crow is both subtle and pure evil at the same time. The Crow shows that you don't need to go overboard on costumes to give a frightning image. I'd sh*t my pants if i saw some guy coming towards me looking like Lee. The plot was simple yet creative and believable. The acting slips a bit here and there, for example when Lee gives the morphine lecture to Sarah's mother and at times he seems uncomfortable saying the word \\"Shelly.\\" However, the movie always seems to recover. Favorite scenes are probably when he goes after Tin Tin because it just looks so dark and evil , and the big shootout at Top Dollar's, that just goes without saying. Despite that Skank guy being a little annoyingly dumb and the unthreatening gang member names (Tin Tin, Fun Boy) this movie excels. My favorite superhero movie is still Batman Begins, but this one really surprised me with its simple, dark, and just downright evil ways.

1400032717|1.0|When Mark Haddon's book, \\"The Curious Incident...\\" first came out, the reviews were just short of gushing.  Having finally read it, I think those reviews reflect more of their authors' sense of political correctness than the book's author's accomplishment.  To state that accomplishment fairly, Haddon takes us into the mind of an autistic fifteen year old and offers an interesting hypothesis regarding how that mind might work.  That said, however, this book is awful.<br /><br />The title refers to a dead dog that Christopher, the central character, finds on his neighbor's lawn.  Neither the scene, nor the neighbor when we meet her, is at all charming.  Christopher \\"investigates\\" the incident, thereby making the book a murder mystery in the overly eager eyes of some reviewers.  But in actuality, the book is a chronicle of how Christopher thinks.  As anyone knows who has dealt with an autistic child or adult, the experience can be frustrating in the extreme.  Here we are given as much insight as the narrative voice is capable of giving of Christopher's likes and dislikes.  We receive, however, only the barest glimpses of the living hell his parents endure on a daily basis, for we see their lives through Christopher's eyes, and Christopher is incapable of empathy.  Reading this book reminded me of nothing so much as Peter Sellers' \\"Being There,\\" and watching Chauncey Gardner simply move along on the current of life, never really engaging with the world around him.  I did not find that movie entertaining either, although the critics' embrace of Haddon's book does remind me of the acclaim that greeted Chauncey's inane utterances in that movie.  Christopher's parents remain two-dimensional at best, and the rest of the characters merely form a backdrop for Christopher's skewed musings.  The repeated glimpses of his mathematical skills are overdone and display only the author's apparent delight in his own cleverness.  They, and \\"Christopher's\\" endless drawings, bored me silly.<br /><br />Except for perhaps those directly impacted by autism, I cannot imagine anyone finding this book at all enjoyable, particularly informative, or in any way uplifting.  Avoid it at all costslly. <br /> <br />Except for perhaps those directly impacted by autism, I cannot imagine anyone finding this book at all enjoyable, particularly informative, or in any way uplifting.

They remind you of people you know or at one time knew.<br /><br />  What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? Not much. All I know is that everyone should read it sometime before they die. It's also one of the few books that you can read more than once without ever getting tired of it. So, make a trip to your local library, pick up a copy, and enjoy every minute of it.
0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead absolutely blew me away.  It might have been the deeply human characters, filled with thousands of emotions and troubles and joys and passions.  It might have been the richly imagined setting and the grand space epic the Card has crafted as his world.  Or it might have been the rich philosophical texturing that permeates every aspect of the book. <br /> <br />Speaker for the Dead will challenge your beliefs.  It is not a comfortable novel, so to speak.  It does not reaffirm your every conviction about the nature of life and the universe.  Card pits many ways of life and thinking--each of them right in their own way--against one another in a struggle for the perpetuation of an  entire world.  This book will makes you think, and it makes you question. <br /> <br />But in the end, Speaker for the Dead will leave you in awe.  You will feel the triumph of love and truth and friendship against all odds.  You will cry for the tragic beauty of the sacrifices we make in the name of our beliefs.  And you will realize that when all the chips are down, it's what is in our hearts that counts most. <br /> <br />Speaker for the Dead is a storyof profound sadness and grief, of turmoil and tribulation and sorely-tested faith.  But it is also, I think, the most hopeful story I have ever read.  It is a story of not only humanity, but of both human and alien life, and the love and compassion that bind us.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|I personally am happy that they put the live version of Big Love instead of the studio.  I found that song to be poppy and wasn't a big fan of it.  I think this is a great collection.  It has the best songs from the period most people want.  I love the old stuff, but I think it would weaken this set and mix things up too much to please anyone.  Next, we need a Very Best of the early years set.
B00000AOUD|3.0|I brought this CD because a friend recommended it. This is a good example of progressive rock, but actually the style is repetitive. If this is your first CD on Jethro I would recommend it, but if you already have aqualang, stay there.
B000028U0Y|5.0|johnny cash is unquestionably in the status of legends. the man in black has a naturally captivating presence, an emotional air about him. in fact, i believe he was the first concert i ever went to. but really, \\"at folsom prison\\" is the product of being at the right place at the right time. the energy here is unparallel to anything that could have been recorded in a studio, because it effectively paints a picture. from the theme of the music to the prisoners high applause

6304907648|5.0|It's sad for me to see only 48 reviews for this movie on Amazon. It is one of my favorite movies of all time and lots of the crappiest movies that I have seen have 200 reviews on Amazon. For all of you that have seen this movie, tell your friends to see it, or if anyone reading this wants to watch an excellent thriller or suspense movie, this is one excellent movie. The Silence of the Lambs is the best suspsense/thriller movie of all time but this isn't far behind.  <br />These are my top 5 thrillers/suspense movies: <br />1. The Silence of the Lambs <br />2. Se7en <br />3. Fallen <br />4. Red Dragon <br />5. Copycat <br />These are some of the finest movies that I have seen and are in my top 50 movies of all time list. Check out my list please as these movies are movies that I find to be quite excellent.  <br />Well, this movie starts off with a bang. Helen (Sigourney Weaver) is at a conference talking about serial killers when she is nearly killed by a murderer that she is helping put away for good. From then on, she is not able to leave her house (forget what it's called, one of the phobias). 13 months later, a new killer emerges. But, it seems that this killer is copying old murders. The killer plays with Helen and messes with her mind and she becomes an important part in stopping this madman. <br />Holly Hunter is fantastic as usual as is Sigourney Weaver. The suspense is constant and the movie is always exciting.  <br />I strongly recommend this superb thriller and I think that you should add this to your collection.
B0007OY2P8|5.0|I got this movie with my BBC \\"Jane Austen Collection\\" (5 DVDs of old BBC adaptations) and didn't like it at first. It's completely different from the others and it lacks, or so I thought, one of the qualities that I enjoy in all other Austen movies: cheerful common sense. The nightmare scene in which Mrs. Richards apparently sews her fingers together was especially upsetting. <br /> <br />I still don't like to watch the finger-sewing scene but I do love hearing Mrs. R. saying, dreamily, while she sews, \\"My only acquaintance...tore my gown.\\" This movie is now my current Austen favorite. I've watched it 7 or 8 times so far. The acting, to my mind, is incredible. The way I notice good acting is when I find myself looking up from whatever I'm doing (sewing, though not my fingers together, hopefully, or boondoggling or whatever) in order to watch the character deliver his lines. It's the turn of expression, the cast of posture, that make the words come alive -- that's what makes good acting, as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br />Well, I watch almost every part of \\"Northanger Abbey\\" because almost all the actors play their roles with such charisma. Peter Firth is amazing as Mr. Tilney, the perfect blend of Bathian fop and real, masculine hero - you're not sure until the end whether he's after Catherine's money or not. I love his touch of (Welsh?) accent. Mr. and Mrs. Richards are charming: the combination of their behaviors - especially Mr. Richards' high voice, lending counterpoint to his wit and wisdom - makes them so real. General Tilney as the hard-hearted father who may possibly be a murderer is fascinating, too. And Captain Tilney, the grinning rake who is so clearly enjoying himself... and the moneygrubbing sister and brother whose names I can't currently remember - the two of them are so perfectly, at once, smart and smarmy. <br /> <br />The other reason I love this adaptation is that it is the most romantic of all the Jane Austen adaptations. I know this was oneof Austen's weak points (well, it is as far as I am concerned): even though all her novels are love stories, it's hard to feel that her heroes and heroines are really in love at the end. And if they're aren't really in love, then what's the point? All the other adaptations I've seen (other than the early Olivier/Garson one) have pretty cold-fish kisses at the end, if they kiss at all. I don't at all like sex in movies but it really is necessary to have a heartfelt kiss in the end. And the ending kiss in Northanger is a doozy. <br /> <br />The over-the-top approach to costumes, music, and lighting work very well as far as I'm concerned. And the script is extremely clever - the way we are educated about Gothic romance, highlife in Bath, Cathy's normal country upbringing, etc., is very well done, as they usually are in BBC productions. Also, I like the part when the little black page does the cartwheels. And the Marchionesse, I think, was an entirely appropriate and very clever expository device. <br /> <br />Some people have objected that this version is the opposite of what Jane Austen intended to do in Northanger Abbey - she meant to make fun of Gothic romance, not promote it. But I don't think she meant to put \\"Mysteries of Udolpho,\\" etc., down. She was just making the point that you need to distinguish between reality and fiction. And this point is made when Mr. Tilney chides Catherine in his mother's room. Besides, General Tilney was a villain, albeit a prosaic one. That point was meant to be made, surely.   <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|1.0|What really bugs me about coldplay is people think they're a real band.  They sing off these tired sentimental cliches and people think they have substance. To me, they're no different than boybands like Nsync.  They're every bit as contrived, preconceived, concocted, and \\"for the masses\\" produced.  Actually, they're 10x worse.  Everyone knows what Nsync is - a money making machine - and no one trys to pretend differently.  Coldplay tries to pretend like their music is for the good of humanity or some sh*t.  That clown Chris Martin and his Make Trade Fair B.S.  It's all part of the Coldplay package.  And idiots are actually taken in hook, line and sinker and buy their mediocre music.  They're just another greedy money making machince.  Don't be part of their target market. Don't buy
0316172324|3.0|I rather enjoyed all the stories in this book; it definitely is food for thought, especially, I think, concerning the \\"love lab\\" experiments where observers can tell if a marriage is healthy or not by observing them conversing about a controversial subject.  It is also absolutely fascinating to read about doctors and their decision making, and the study of facial expressions.  However, a collection of stories do not make up a definitive discourse on how we make decisions.  I thought it interesting that sleep was not even discussed.  We all know that lack of sleep can impair our judgement drastically, and as a sleep-deprived parent at times, I can tell it affects my emotions and snap decisions way more than many other factors.  That is why I say it makes the brain seem too simplistic; there are just too many variables to be covered.  However, I would recommend reading it because it is a pleasure to read and is very quick; and I found it interesting how it caused me to pause and observe my son's pediatrician this morning more carefully.  That makes it fun.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|<br />\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is a fanomenal film, loved by both adults and children. You may find yourself wonder how can a movie (especially an animated one) get so many positive reviews, as B&B has. Name at least two titles this critically acclaimed! You can't think of any? No wonder, \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" was the first animated feature to be nominated to the Academy Award for the Best Picture. Everything about the movie is just perfect - Alan Menken's breathtaking music, the animators' solid work, stunning backgrounds and, what's the most notable, the wonderful voice actors. The leading duo Belle and the Beast, was voiced by the wonderful Paige O'Hara and Robby Benson. Thanks to Paige, Belle has the most adorable and enchanting voice of all the Disney heroines, and Robby makes the Beast a multi-dimensional character, either scary and majestic or sensitive and caring. All the side-kicks are also highly entertaining and original.  <br /> <br />What more can I say? Don't hestitate for a second and get this amazing masterpiece now. \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" is the one of the finest movies ever made!!!
B000255LNE|5.0|In 2004, only two years after releasing his tenth album entitled, TESTIFY, Phil Collins released eleventh and most recent album entitled, LOVE SONGS: A COMPILATION...OLD AND NEW. This album features all of Phil Collins love songs, taking up two discs. The album even features five new songs, as well as four live songs. This album is just amazing.    Disc One  TEARING AND BREAKING    New song. Not bad.    DO YOU REMEMBER?    From the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). Great.    ONE MORE NIGHT    From the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Not a favorite, but I can still listen to it without a problem.    AGAINST ALL ODDS (TAKE A LOOK AT ME NOW)    From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack AGAINST ALL ODDS (1984). This song really grew on me after all the years I've spent hating it. Great song, not to mention sad.    CAN'T TURN BACK THE YEARS    From the album BOTH SIDES (1993). Great song.    A GROOVY KIND OF LOVE    From the original motion picture & motion picture BUSTER (1988). Awesome song. This is one hell of a ballad.    EVERYDAY    From the album BOTH SIDES (1993). Great.    DON'T LET HIM STEAL YOUR HEART AWAY    New song. Great song.    PLEASE COME OUT TONIGHT    From the album BOTH SIDES (1993). Great.    THIS MUST BE LOVE    From the album FACE VALUE (1981). Great.    IT'S IN YOUR EYES    From the album DANCE INTO THE LIGHT (1996). Great song.    CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU    From the album TESTIFY (2002). Great song.    Disc Two  TESTIFY    From the album TESTIFY (2002). Great song.    TRUE COLORS (Live Rehearsal)    Studio version from the album ...HITS (1998). Back in the year of 1986, Cyndi Lauper had recorded \\"True Colors\\" for her album TRUE COLORS. Cyndi's version is a lot better than Phil's, but Phil Collins did a very good job in recording this song. Yes, I would listen to Phil's rendition, mainly because he did a descent job and because I like the song.    YOU'LL BE IN MY HEART    From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack TARZAN (1999). For the Disney film cartoon version of Tarzan, Phil Collins had been asked to record this beautiful song. This song is dedicated to my late grandfather from my entire family.    IF LEAVING ME IS EASY    From the album FACE VALUE (1981). Great.    I'VE BEEN TRYING    New song. Not bad.    I'VE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING    From the album BOTH SIDES (1993). Great.    SOMEWHERE    New song. Great song.    THE LEAST YOU CAN DO    From the album TESTIFY (2002). Great song.    TWO HEARTS    From the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack BUSTER (1988). Great fun-filled song.    SEPARATE LIVES (Duet with Bridgette Bryant) (Live)    From the album SERIOUS HITS...LIVE! (1990). Studio version from the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack WHITE NIGHTS (1985). This song was originally a duet with Marilyn Martin. When Phil performed this song live, he had his female backing vocalist, Bridgette Bryant, sing all of Marilyn Martin's vocals. As beautiful as Bridgette's voice is, she can't match the voice of Marilyn Martin.    MY GIRL (Live)    This song was originally recorded by The Temptations. I've always hated this song.    ALWAYS (Live)    Not bad.    THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT (Live)    I do not know who originally recorded this song, but I have always loved it. Phil does it great here.        Phil Collins is definitely a Legend. Don't anybody tell me any different because that is fact and it is proven here with this incredible compilation full of Phil's greatest love songs. So get out and by LOVE SONGS: A COMPILATION...OLD & NEW.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The beach boys may not have the same depth as the beatles in their discography, but for one album, the beach boys couldn't be touched.  <br /> <br />I always thought of the beach boys as a band that made simple music to please fans. Songs like \\"Surfin' USA\\" and \\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" show up on commercials and you think you \\"know\\" the band without buying anything. The song \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\" is catchy enough, and the reason I decided to give the \\"Sounds of Summer\\" compilation a shot. I was impressed with quite a lot of the album and even the earlier pop stuff grew on me a lot. <br /> <br />But \\"Wouldn't it be nice\\" is not the reason to get this album. I even skip it occasionally because i've heard it about 10 kazillion times. You have to get this album for the songs you may have not heard before. \\"You still believe in me,\\" \\"That's not me,\\" \\"Don't talk,\\" \\"I'm waiting for the day,\\" \\"Let's go away for a while,\\" \\"I know there's an answer,\\" \\"Here today,\\" \\"I just wasn't made for these times,\\" \\"Pets sounds,\\" and last, but not least, \\"Caroline no.\\" I haven't heard any of these songs before I got this album. Oddly enough, these are the best songs on Pet Sounds, with maybe the exception of the title track and Here today. \\"God only knows\\" is also among the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />And it's not like the songs on here are awesome for a while and then you stop listening to them. These are not like typical pop songs. I don't know how, but they just get better and better. Whether or not you agree it's the best album of all time doesn't really matter. The important thing is that you hear these songs. It will change the way you think about music.
B000002UDB|5.0|In November of 1967, The Beatles released their fourteenth album entitled, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. This album was to coincide with the original television series The Beatles were starring in on NBC. This album just picks on up with the 60s Cycodelic sound that I have enjoyed on the SGT. PEPPER album. This is definitely a classic Beatles album. <br /> <br />MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR <br />  The album's classic & infamous title track. You cannot get anymore cycodelic than this. This song is just classic, especially on those synethesizers. Classic! Classic! Classic! <br /> <br />THE FOOL ON THE HILL <br />  I never knew the name of this song, until I put this album on and heard the beginning of the song. This is a great song and Paul sings it perfectly well. <br /> <br />FLYING <br />  Just instrumental piece. Nothing special. <br /> <br />BLUE JAY WAY <br />  This is a great song. It is strange, I'll be the first to admit that, but I just love it. It's a great song. <br /> <br />YOUR MOTHER SHOULD KNOW <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I AM THE WALRUS <br />  \\"I am the eggmen. They are they eggmen. I am the walrus. Goo Goo Goo Joob\\", sings John on this masterpiece work of art. This song is just outstanding and it fits the album perfectly, as well their era. Classic. <br /> <br />HELLO GOODBYE <br />  A classic song. <br /> <br />STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER <br />  While John Lennon sang, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", I sang, \\"The Beatles Are Indeed Forever\\". This song is just classic. My father's Beatles band, ALMOST FAB, includes this in their setlist when they perform their gigs. Let me tell you now that when they perform this song, it is SCARY! It sounds so much like this album version. If you saw my father's band and heard them sing this, you would have to close your eyes and just use your eyes. When you close your eyes, you would swear that you were listening to this album. <br /> <br />PENNY LANE <br />  Another classic. <br /> <br />BABY YOU'RE A RICH MAN <br />  This is about the only song I really do not like on this album. Sorry, guys. <br /> <br />ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE <br />  This song fits the era of this album perfectly. This song is just awesome. <br /> <br />    All Beatles fans must have this album now. If you don't have it, I'll be looking for you. When I find you, I'll help you slam your money down onto the counter in order for you to pay for your copy of MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR. This album is just outstanding. That only goes to show that The Beatles Are Indeed Forever.
B0007GADZO|3.0|I was all excited when I heard Real Illusions was coming out. For the most part, Steve Vai's albums have been getting better and better, even while he tried all sorts of diiferent things and experimented. I've listened to this disc at least half a dozen times and with a few exceptions, I just can't get really excited about it. The majority of the album seems as if Steve didn't refine his ideas and music and released the CD anyway. Many of the songs have an unfinished quality to them and a few are just not very listenable. I just listened to Fire Garden tonight and it blows Illusions away. With the exception of Flexable, which is just wacked but still very cool;  Vai (the band) which was too wierd with Devin Townsend's amazingly excruciating voice; and this one, all the other albums are superb. My personal faves are Alien Love Secrets (I LOVE Bad Horsie!!), Fire Garden, Ultra Zone, and the amazing Alive In An Ultra World (weird title but awesome album!). Don't get me wrong, Illusions is a good album, even great for someone else. But because it's Steve Vai, I was actually a bit disappointed.
B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles have been the groundbreakers in music history. If The Beatles had not released their now more-than-popular music, no other act would have been involved in the music industry, such as Madonna, Cher, Heart, Richard Marx, David Bowie, George Michael, Stevie Nicks, Phil Collins, and so on. The Beatles, whose lineup has always been, PAUL MCCARTNEY (Bass Guitars & Lead Vocals), JOHN LENNON (Rhythm Guitars & Lead Vocals), GEORGE HARRISON (Lead Guitars & Lead Vocals), & RINGO STARR (Drums & Lead Vocals), were & are the epitome of classic Rock & Roll. <br /> <br />    In 1963, The Beatles had released their first album entitled, PLEASE PLEASE ME. This album is far beyond amazing. All fourteen songs on this album are just outstanding. Only six of these fourteen songs were covers, leaving the other eight songs to be written by Beatles members, Paul McCartney & John Lennon. <br /> <br />I SAW HER STANDING THERE <br />    That 1-2-3-4 countdown in the beginning of this outstanding song is so recognizeable today that you can't help yourself when you count along. This song is one of The Beatles' greatest songs to be recorded in all music history. In 1988, Tiffany had recorded this song on her first album, only she had called the song, \\"I Saw Him Standing There\\". Tiffany had butchered the living hell out of it. The Beatles rendition will always remain the classic. I also enjoy hearing this song because Bassist, Paul McCartney takes the lead on this song. Paul is actually my favorite Beatle. <br /> <br />MISERY <br />  A great song. <br /> <br />ANNA (GO TO HIM) <br />  Great. <br /> <br />CHAINS <br />  Great. <br /> <br />BOYS <br />  Taking over the lead vocals for this song is Drummer, Ringo Starr. This is another of my favorite songs. <br /> <br />ASK ME WHY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />PLEASE PLEASE ME <br />  The album's incredible title track. How could anyone not love this song? This just \\"Please Pleases Me\\". <br /> <br />LOVE ME DO <br />  That harmonica in the very beginning of the song is one hell of an opener and the most recognized sound ever heard. Great song. <br /> <br />P.S. I LOVE YOU <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />BABY IT'S YOU <br />  Great. <br /> <br />DO YOU WANT TO KNOW A SECRET <br />  Lead Guitarist, George Harrison had decided to take over lead vocals on this incredible song that I still very much enjoy today. <br /> <br />A TASTE OF HONEY <br />  Great. <br /> <br />THERE'S A PLACE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />TWIST AND SHOUT <br />  John Lennon, who does a handful of lead vocals on half of The Beatles' music, sings here, as on many of this albums songs. This song was originally recorded by Chuck Berry. Now, I hate 50s music. It sucks. The Beatles had the guts to re-record this song and make it a classic hit. <br /> <br />    The Beatles actually recorded this album in one whole day. They did record the album in one of the members' houses, but I don't exactly remember who, but I do remember that The Beatles' producer, George Martin, who has a handful of help in The Beatles songs, such as \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" & \\"In My Life\\", had requested that The Beatles record \\"Twist And Shout\\" last because he knew that it would make John's voice sound raspy after all of the singing the guys did with the first thirteen songs on this album. If you are a crazed Beatles fan, such as myself, then buy PLEASE PLEASE ME and get a first taste of The Beatles' music.
B00000AFWW|5.0|I don't listen to a lot of newer alt or punk, but I just have to say that \\"Boys on the Radio\\" blows me away time after time. It is a great punk anthem in the tradition of \\"Pretty Vacant\\" or \\"Personality Crisis\\". The other songs are great, especially \\"Malibu\\", \\"Heaven Tonight\\" these are great anthemic pieces with soaring melodies, poignant guitar work, tight harmonies and an incessant beat.<br /><br />Both the song-writing and the production of this album is simply beautiful. Great CD to drive to.<br /><br />As crazy and self-destructive as Courtney Love is, she proves that she has the talent of her late husband, Kurt Cobain. Hopefully her life will have a happier ending and she'll treat us to more great tunes and less gossip column fodder.
B000002UAI|5.0|In July of 1964, The Beatles released their fifth album entitled, SOMETHING NEW, another compilation album, with the exception of two new songs for the album. <br /> <br />    In December of 1964, The Beatles released their sixth album entitled, BEATLES FOR SALE. No, The Beatles are not for sale, since you can't buy a literal human being, or four human beings for that matter. But you can buy this amazing album that seemed to have made me love The Beatles even more when I first heard this album. <br /> <br />NO REPLY <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />I'M A LOSER <br />  \\"I'm A Loser\\", is what The Beatles say as the first line to this great hit classic. Gotta love this song. <br /> <br />BABY'S IN BLACK <br />  I remember being a kid and loving this song. I have always enjoyed hearing this song. It is one of their greatest songs to be released. <br /> <br />ROCK & ROLL MUSIC <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />I'LL FOLLOW THE SUN <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />MR. MOONLIGHT <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />MEDLEY: KANSAS CITY/HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY <br />  Great medley. Expect two more medlies to come some five years after this album. <br /> <br />EIGHT DAYS A WEEK <br />  This song is an instant classic. I love this song. <br /> <br />WORDS OF LOVE <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />EVERY LITTLE THING <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL THE PARTY <br />  Great. <br /> <br />WHAT YOU'RE DOING <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />    This is another album that all Beatles fan around the world can enjoy. I have certainly enjoyed it time and time again. BEATLES FOR SALE is definitely yours if you buy a copy right now.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Smallville season one lays out a decent groundwork for the creators' version of the Superman mythos. Many of the other reviewers here note the first season's heavy use of the \\"freak of the week\\" device, which is definitely the show's weakest aspect.<br /><br />However, there are still plenty of enjoyable moments in the first season that make it worthwhile. Anyone who knows anything about Superman will catch the cute (if somewat cheesy) references to future events in Clark Kent's life sprinkled throughout the characters' dialogue. And the scene with Jonathan Kent driving down the road and singing the \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\" theme song is hilarious.<br /><br />Although the first season isn't the best one, I find the repetitious weekly plots forgiveable because each episode *does* advance a character or overall plot point, and you have to keep in mind as well that many shows' actors are in the ongoing process of finding their characters during the first season - and this season of Smallville gave its actors that chance, as well as laying out the framework for the plotlines that come up in future seasons.
B000002UAC|5.0|In 1963, just a few months after releasing their first album entitled, PLEASE PLEASE ME, The Beatles released their second album entitled, WITH THE BEATLES. This album saw the same amount of success as that of PLEASE PLEASE ME. This album is definitely one of The Beatles' best. <br /> <br />IT WON'T BE LONG <br />  Just an awesome song. John's voice, althought not that great at times, sounds great here. <br /> <br />ALL I'VE GOTTA DO <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />ALL MY LOVING <br />  This is one of my favorite songs. Paul's voice, as it always is, is just pure gold. His voice is always awesome. <br /> <br />DON'T BOTHER ME <br />  Great. <br /> <br />LITTLE CHILD <br />  Great. <br /> <br />TILL THERE WAS YOU <br />  This song is really nice, but I was never too fond of it. It is not one of my favorites. <br /> <br />PLEASE MR. POSTMAN <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN <br />  George Harrison takes over on Lead Vocals here and he does a great job of singing this old classic hit. The original version sucked, while The Beatles brought it back with a vengence. <br /> <br />HOLD ME TIGHT <br />  Great. <br /> <br />YOU'VE REALLY GOT A HOLD ON ME <br />  Awesome. <br /> <br />I WANNA BE YOUR MAN <br />  Ringo Starr takes over on Lead Vocals here. Ringo's voice was never that great, but I do like his voice. His voice just has a quality to it that brings life to the songs he sings lead on. <br /> <br />DEVIL IN HER HEART <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />NOT A SECOND TIME <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />MONEY (THAT'S WHAT I WANT) <br />  Great job here. <br /> <br />    The Beatles were definitely being adored in the eyes of their British fans. Pretty soon, The Beatles would fly over to America, a year from the release of this album and PLEASE PLEASE ME and become adored by their American fans for years to come. This album, as well as PLEASE PLEASE ME, is the start of all that.
B000077VR3|1.0|Most reviewers giving this \\"film\\" a 5-star rating concede \\"either you love it or you hate it\\". This is true, just as you either have a brain or you don't. Watching this movie was like watching hyperactive 8 year-olds on speed doing some sort of sock-puppet routine in front of the mirror. It boggles the mind that some talented actors (and I don't mean Leguizamo) participated in this nonsense. And about Leguizamo....what drug would cause someone's brain to choose him to play Toulouse-Lautrec?
B000002IQ9|5.0|In 1990, Phil Collins had been on THE ...BUT SERIOUSLY TOUR, where during that concert tour, Phil Collins had released his first live album entitled, SERIOUS HITS...LIVE! This album, although being Phil's first live album, is his sixth album overall. Phil always had a way with singing in the studio, but singing live is definitely gift for good ole Phil because this album is outstanding. <br /> <br />SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN <br />  Studio version from the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). The album version was just outstanding and it goes right next to this live version. Awesome. <br /> <br />AGAINST ALL ODDS (TAKE A LOOK AT ME NOW) <br />  Studio version from the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack AGAINST ALL ODDS (1984). For years, I had gone on without even listening to this song, but years later, I gave the song another shot and I cannot get enough of it. <br /> <br />WHO SAID I WOULD <br />  Studio version from the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Just as energetic and fun-filled as the album version. <br /> <br />ONE MORE NIGHT <br />  Studio version from the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Better than the original. <br /> <br />DON'T LOSE MY NUMBER <br />  Studio version from the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Both the studio version and this here live version are outstanding. <br /> <br />DO YOU REMEMBER? <br />  Studio version from the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). Even better than the studio version. <br /> <br />ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE <br />  Studio version from the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). Both versions are just amazing. <br /> <br />SEPARATE LIVES (Duet with Bridgette Bryant) <br />  Studio version from the original motion picture & motion picture WHITE NIGHTS (1985). The studio version to this song was actually a duet between Phil Collins & Marilyn Martin, but it is obvious that Marilyn Martin is not present on her vocals, but Phil's backing vocalist Bridgette Bryant. Bridgette Bryant's voice is very pretty,but Marilyn Martin's voice was even prettier. But this live version stands right next to the original studio version. <br /> <br />IN THE AIR TONIGHT <br />  Studio version from the album FACE VALUE (1981). Great song, even performed live. <br /> <br />YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE <br />  Studio version from the album HELLO, I MUST BE GOING! (1982). Not bad. <br /> <br />TWO HEARTS <br />  Studio version from the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack BUSTER (1988). Great song. <br /> <br />SUSSUDIO <br />  Studio version from the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Great song. <br /> <br />A GROOVY KIND OF LOVE <br />  Studio version from the original motion picture & motion picture soundtrack BUSTER (1988). Awesome ballad. <br /> <br />EASY LOVER (With Arnold McCuller & Fred White) <br />  Studio version from Phillip Bailey's album CHINESE WALL (1984). As you all know, \\"Easy Lover\\" was a duet between Phillip Bailey (of EARTH WIND & FIRE) & Phil Collins. Providing the vocals for Phillip Bailey's verses are two of Phil Collins' male backing vocalists, Arnold McCuller & Fred White. Not bad. <br /> <br />TAKE ME HOME <br />  Studio version from the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Awesome tune. <br /> <br />    Phil Collins is just a genius Icon. His incredible voice and great songs inspire his millions of fans around the world. He continues to inspire with this here incredible live album that all Phil Collins fans should have.

0141301066|5.0|Mr. Roald Dahl was a very talented fellow, and this book proves it. I don't think of it as a \\"children's book,\\" but as a \\"whimsical fantasy\\" that will delight young and old -- and everyone in between.<br />  Matilda is a child genius whose parents treat her like dust on the furniture, even when she gets even for being ignored by adding bleach to her male parental unit's hair pomade and making her female parental unit think the house is haunted. She has a thirst for learning, so she goes to a school -- run by the Headmistress from Hell, who thinks everyone who's not an adult is a \\"piece of filth\\" and gets her jollies by torturing the youngsters. Spiked torture boxes! Grabbing little girls by their braids! Throwing children over the fence! Why, she even force-fed one unfortunate young fellow a WHOLE chocolate cake in front of the whole school. (I felt poor Bruce Bogtrotter's pain during the famous -- or should that be infamous -- Cake Scene) But the one she REALLY had it in for was -- you guessed right -- Matilda, who is not only a genius but has powers of telekinesis to boot!<br />  Her one adult ally is Miss honey, as sweet as her name, who shows Our Heroine what it's like to feel cared for.<br />  If i could give this book 10 stars I would! Good work, Mr. D.! This is right up there with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|In 1998, just two years after releasing eighth album entitled, DANCE INTO THE LIGHT, Phil Collins released his ninth album entitled, ...HITS. This album turned out to be Phil Collins' first-ever greatest hits compilation. This album is just amazing. And you better read on to find out why. <br /> <br />ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE  <br />From the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). This is actually a song that I have always liked. It is definitely one of Phil's best songs.  <br /> <br />TRUE COLORS  <br />New song. This song was actually made famous by 80s superstar, Cyndi Lauper. To be honest, I prefer Cyndi Lauper's version than Phil's version. But I wouldn't mind listening to Phil's version because I like the song.  <br /> <br />EASY LOVER (Duet with Phillip Bailey)  <br />From Phil Bailey's album CHINESE WALL (1985). Great song. <br /> <br />YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE  <br />From the album HELLO, I MUST BE GOING! (1982). Not Bad.  <br /> <br />TWO HEARTS  <br />From the original motion picture BUSTER (1989). Here's a song that I have always enjoyed hearing. A funfilled song.  <br /> <br />I WISH IT WOULD RAIN DOWN  <br />From the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). This is the song that turned me into a fan. This is definitely a powerful song, with amazing music, and Phil's amazing voice.  <br /> <br />AGAINST ALL ODDS (TAKE A LOOK AT ME NOW)  <br />From the original motion picture & soundtrack AGAINST ALL ODDS (1984). For years, I went on living my life without ever liking this song. But I found the song to have grown me a great deal, and now it is one of my Phil Collins favorites. <br /> <br />SOMETHNG HAPPENED TO ME ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN  <br />From the album ...BUT SERIOUSLY (1989). This song has one hell of a rhythm and sound.  <br /> <br />SEPARATE LIVES (Duet with Marilyn Martin)  <br />From the original motion picture & soundtrack WHITE NIGHTS (1985). This song is absolutely beautiful. Marilyn's voice is beautifully relaxing.  <br /> <br />BOTH SIDES OF THE STORY  <br />From the album BOTH SIDES (1993). Great song.  <br /> <br />ONE MORE NIGHT  <br />From the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Not one of my favorites, but it is still a good song. <br /> <br />SUSSUDIO  <br />From the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). Awesome. <br /> <br />DANCE INTO THE LIGHT  <br />From the album DANCE INTO THE LIGHT (1996). Great. <br /> <br />A GROOVY KIND OF LOVE  <br />From the original motion picture & soundtrack BUSTER (1989). I am not sure who originally recorded this song, but Phil's version is the definitive version. Another song that puts me into extreme relaxation.  <br /> <br />IN THE AIR TONIGHT  <br />From the album FACE VALUE (1981). Another awesome song. <br /> <br />TAKE ME HOME  <br />From the album NO JACKET REQUIRED (1985). For awhile, I never knew who this was until I got this CD. This is one hell of a song and it will always be one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />    There is a song missing and that is, \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\". That is one of Phil's greatest hits, well, at least in my opinion. But it should still be on here. Other than that, this album is right on the money. So, if you have the money, then buy this album.
0141301155|5.0|I get SICK of people calling this a CHILDREN'S BOOK. It's so limiting. I think of this wonderful confection of a printed entertainment as a WHIMSICAL FANTASY that can be enjoyed by everyone from tiny tot to grandparent. Loved the description of Wonka's candies and the characters/settings. LOVED the factory tour and the Ooompa-Loompa chants for Charlie's naughty tourmates as they got \\"theirs.\\" Poor but kind-hearted Charlie is a true literary hero and role model. Pick up this book and enjoy -- perhaps while snacking on chocolate!
B000002UAR|5.0|In June of 1966, The Beatles released their eleventh album entitled, YESTERDAY...AND TODAY. This album was another compilation album with that of six new songs. Two of those six new songs, \\"Doctor Robert\\" & \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", were planned to be on the following album as well. <br /> <br />    In August of 1966, The Beatles released their twelfth album entitled, REVOLVER. I was not too impressed on this album, but the album still rocks out as it did when it was released almost forty years ago. This would be the last album where The Beatles took up those British-styled Boyish Looking haircuts, with them wearing the black suits, white shirts, & black ties, while singing the uptempo & ballad love songs. <br /> <br />TAXMAN <br />  George Harrison started this album off on lead vocals. This is a great song, but it is not really one of my favorite songs. <br /> <br />ELEANOR RIGBY <br />  This is the only track off of this album, as well as The Beatles' whole career, where Ringo did not provide any drumming, since this song is strictly orchestration and Paul's vocals. The Grammy award did not even go to The Beatles; it went strictly to Paul McCartney. Anyhow, this is my favorite song off of this album. <br /> <br />I'M ONLY SLEEPING <br />  One of my least favorites. <br /> <br />LOVE YOU TO <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />HERE, THERE AND EVERYWHERE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />YELLOW SUBMARINE <br />  Ringo steps up onto the mike for this song. I love this song. You'll notice that this song is what Ringo calls the Kiddie song, since a lot of kids around the ages of 4-8 love this song. Two years after the release of this album, a cartoon film would be made entitled, YELLOW SUBMARINE, where this song is, DUH!, the theme song. <br /> <br />SHE SAID SHE SAID <br />  Great. <br /> <br />GOOD DAY SUNSHINE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING <br />  As I said before, this song was originally released on the album YESTERDAY...AND TODAY. Why they put it here again is, my guess, to fill the space left on the album. <br /> <br />FOR NO ONE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />DOCTOR ROBERT <br />  They also included this song here to fill up the space left on the album, after this song, just like \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", was originally released on the album YESTERDAY...AND TODAY. <br /> <br />I WANT TO TELL YOU <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE <br />  This one was never my favorite. I'm thinking that this song was the start of their cycodelic sound era, for the upcoming album. <br /> <br />TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS <br />  This song is my second-favorite off of the album. Containing that 60s Cycodelic-Hippie-Black Magic-Witch sound. Great song. In 1981, just fifteen years after the release of this album, Phil Collins would go on to cover this song and more than well, I might add. <br /> <br />    This album is very unique and groundbreaking, but it was not one of my favorites. But, I'm not going to speak for no one because my opinion is my opinion, and I let everyone else make their own. So, REVOLVER is yours to buy if you haven't already.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I liked this DVD set. it had so many rock stars, i think it is worth buying if you were into the 80's
B000002UAF|5.0|In 1964, The Beatles had headed over to America and became adored by their American fans, when they made their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. God, was that forty-one years ago? By the time The Beatles gained the respect and love from their American fans, it was known that no matter where The Beatles took their future, they would be considered the greatest band that ever lived. <br /> <br />    In April of 1964, The Beatles released their third album entitled, THE BEATLES' SECOND ALBUM. The album didn't seem to have done too well, since it was a compilation, with five new songs. <br /> <br />    In June of 1964, The Beatles released their fourth album entitled, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. The album is to coincide with their first film of the same name. This album is just incredible, but it was rushed out too quickly for the hissing on the tape is too noticeable. They should've taken their time in making this album, but the songs on this album are just outstanding. <br /> <br />A HARD DAY'S NIGHT  <br />This song should be known by everybody on this planet. That strum in the very beginning is so hard not to miss. This is one of my favorite songs from the guys. It is an undestroyable classic.  <br /> <br />I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER  <br />For years, I never knew what the name of this song was, until my father gave me this album. Another amazing classic.  <br /> <br />IF I FELL  <br />Everybody knows this song. One of the most beautiful ballads to be recorded. This one is one of John's biggest songs in The Beatles' career. <br /> <br />I'M JUST HAPPY TO DANCE WITH YOU  <br />Great. George sings this one very well. <br /> <br />AND I LOVE HER  <br />This song was actually the flip side for the single of, \\"If I Fell\\". This song was also released as a single and is one of their major hits. This is definitely another one of the most beautifully recorded ballads. This song is one of Paul's biggest songs in The Beatles' career. <br /> <br />TELL ME WHY  <br />Awesome.<br /> <br />CAN'T BUY ME LOVE  <br />A great song that points out a great message. Money can't buy you love. But it bought Julia Roberts love in \\"Pretty Woman\\". Just kidding.  <br /> <br />ANYTIME AT ALL  <br />Great song. <br /> <br />I'LL CRY INSETEAD  <br />Not bad. <br /> <br />THINGS WE SAID TODAY <br />Great song. <br /> <br />WHEN I GET HOME <br />Great song. <br /> <br />YOU CAN'T DO THAT <br />This song was supposed to be included in the film, where The Beatles perform it in the ending sequence, but the producers of thought that the ending concert sequence would have made the film longer than they had planned, so the deleted the scene from the final cut. Great song. <br /> <br />I'LL BE BACK <br />Great song. <br /> <br />    This album is just amazing and it is an album that I cannot get enough of. So, make sure that you buy this album and it enjoy it as much as I do.
0199267170|2.0|Anyone wanting to quickly and cheaply collect all 39 of Shakespeare's palys can rely on this edition, an inexpensive, barebones Shakespeare.  Those seeking in-depth study should be forewarned, the texts are not annotated at all...even difficult words have to be looked up in the glossary in the back.  The typical scholarly introductory materials found in the preface and apendices is largely absent.  And to top it off, the type is printed in a dark gray ink, instead of black: not that easy to read.  Scholars and students should look elsewhere.<br /><br />Update: After using this text in the classroom, I would downgrade my rating to one star.  The binding is hardcover, but the its quality is inferior.  Out of ten students in the course, three had books that were falling apart after just two months.
B000002UAU|5.0|In June of 1967, a year after releasing RELOVER, The Beatles released their thirteenth album entitled, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND, an album that is to be one of my favorite Beatles albums. This album is one of my favorites because it shows the cycodelic-late 60s-hippie-weirdo sound that I enjoyed during their time. The Beatles even changed their look for the album. 1) The have facial hair. 2) They have colored stage-show-theatrical outfits. 3) The front cover is theatrical and colorful. I love the whole thing and the album cover is their best album cover by far. <br /> <br />SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND <br />Everyone, especially the ones who are huge Beatles fans, knows that this song is a classic all the damn way. What makes this song one of my favorites is that Paul sings the lead on it. Paul is my favorite Beatle.  <br /> <br />A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS <br />Ringo takes over the lead vocals for this one. Ringo does not have that much of a great voice, but this song is another classic. I don't know who, but someone re-recorded this song and made it the opening theme for the hit show THE WONDER YEARS. The person who re-recorded it butchered the hell out of it. You can't re-record a Beatles song. <br /> <br />LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS <br />An amazing song. This is yet another classic. This is another Beatles tune that is one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />GETTING BETTER <br />Awesome. <br /> <br />FIXING A HOLE <br />Classic.  <br /> <br />SHE'S LEAVING HOME <br />Great.  <br /> <br />BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE <br />Another classic.  <br /> <br />WITHIN YOU, WITHOUT YOU <br />Unbelievable.  <br /> <br />WHEN I'M SIXTY-FOUR <br />I always loved this one. This song is just simply fun. <br /> <br />LOVELY RITA <br />This reminds me of my grandmother because her name is Rita. Great song.  <br /> <br />GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING <br />Awesome.  <br /> <br />SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (Reprise) <br />This song was just a re-recording of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", kind of closing out that song if you listen closely to the lyrics. <br /> <br />A DAY IN THE LIFE <br />Classic. <br /> <br />    The Beatles were really getting around during this time. They seemed to have been becoming more and more popular as time went on and this album certainly proves that. If you are a Beatles fan, and if you haven't already gotten this album, then...WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?! Make sure you buy a copy of SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND.

B000002UB6|5.0|In February of 1970, The Beatles released their eighteenth album entitled HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN). That album was another compilation, while it featured five new songs entitled, \\"Hey Jude\\" (which was recorded and released as a single back in 1968), \\"Lady Madonna\\", \\"Old Brown Shoe\\", \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", & \\"The Ballad Of John & Yoko\\". <br /> <br />    In May of 1970, The Beatles released their nineteenth album entitled, LET IT BE. This album was actually recorded in 1969, right before they recorded the ABBEY ROAD album. When they finished recording this album, they shelved it, thinking that it wouldn't sell. But because of their contract, they were required to deliver another album before they made their breakup official. They chose LET IT BE to be their last studio recorded album. LET IT BE is classic work of art and it is a sad album in the sense that it was to be their last studio recorded album, following that of their tragic breakup. <br /> <br />TWO OF US <br />  Incredible. <br /> <br />DIG A PONY <br />  Great. <br /> <br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I ME MINE <br />  Amazing. <br /> <br />DIG IT <br />  Great. <br /> <br />LET IT BE <br />  The album's amazingly beautiful title track. In 1998, when Linda McCartney, Paul's first wife, had passed on after her battle with breast cancer, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, & Ringo Starr had performed this song at her memorial service. I think that performing this for Linda was one of the greatest gestures in saying goodbye. This song is just outstanding. <br /> <br />MAGGIE MAE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />I'VE GOT A FEELING <br />  Paul McCartney does most of the lead vocals himself on this song, but John then comes in on lead vocals and finishes out the song, with a rather \\"Funny\\" line in the song. Great song. <br /> <br />ONE AFTER 909 <br />  This song is one of their best. They do sing a little fast, but that is what I like about it. The fastness to the vocals really fits the essence of the song. <br /> <br />THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD <br />  This song is another one of my all-time favorite songs. This song has to be one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. <br /> <br />FOR YOU BLUE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />GET BACK <br />  Another one of the greatest songs they have ever recorded. I will be seeing Paul McCartney in concert for the first time in my hometown of South Philadelphia on September 23, 2005. I am hoping that he will perform this song. <br /> <br />    This album, as I said before, was, sadly enough, their last studio album together. When they breakup happened, all of us fans (well, I was not born until 15 years later), were heartbroken, but they had left behind a legacy that was to be remembered by everyone on this planet. The Beatles were, indeed, the best band that had \\"Come Together\\". They will forever be in our hearts and memories. I have grown up with The Beatles. I am 20 years old and I have the most fondest memories with their music. Listening to these albums brings back memories that reach as far as my days in diapers. This band is the ultimate meaning of the word \\"Music\\" and they can never be forgotten. Buying this album helps etch your memories of The Beatles in pure stone. So, make sure you have or buy a copy of LET IT BE right now.

B000002UAO|5.0|In December of 1965, The Beatles released their tenth album entitled RUBBER SOUL. This album is classified as another incredible Beatles album. This album contains many of The Beatles greatest songs. Many fans have loved this album, even today. <br /> <br />DRIVE MY CAR <br />  This is one classic song no fan will ever forget. Most people will remember that back in 1993, when Paul McCartney had put together his 1993 world tour, he had opened up each concert on that tour with \\"Drive My Car\\". Paul didn't stop there. On June 2nd, 2005, LiveAid was held again, 20 years after the first LiveAid Concert. Paul was to perform \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band\\" with U2 and he performed \\"Drive My Car\\" with George Michael. <br /> <br />NORWEIGAN WOOD (THIS BIRD HAS FLOWN) <br />  This is another one of my favorite songs. It's a total classic. <br /> <br />YOU WON'T SEE ME <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />NOWHERE MAN <br />  The harmonies on this song are unbelievable, just like the song itself. Great song. <br /> <br />THINK FOR YOURSELF <br />  Great <br /> <br />THE WORD <br />  Awesome song. I had never known the name of this song until I heard it when I bought the album. <br /> <br />MICHELLE <br />  Great song. When I hear this song, I think of Michelle Dessler (a character on my favorite show entitled 24). <br /> <br />WHAT GOES ON <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />GIRL <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />I'M LOOKING THROUGH YOU <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />IN MY LIFE <br />  This song was The Beatles second biggest song, with John Lennon on Lead Vocals. I do not really care for this song. <br /> <br />RUN FOR YOUR LIFE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />    With the exception of \\"In My Life\\", RUBBER SOUL is a Beatles album that every Beatles fan around the world should own. If not, then hurry the hell up; the album is not getting any younger. This album rocks and it refuses to sit on stores shelves and collect dust.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|FINALLY it's here and released on DVD, Cry-Baby the Director's Cut!  This extended version is worth every penny for the serious, die-hard Cry-Baby fans.  Like myself, who knows every line word-for-word, I of course found myself getting tongue tied and silent on parts that were new to me for the first time. Things started to make sense to me with the included scenes, for instance what seemed to be out-of-place scenes of the sleezy Kojo character, or the infamous courtroom scene where the \\"F\\" word is bleeped out repeatedly (not in this version friends!).  Mysteries like this and much more are revealed through the indepth \\"It Came From Baltimore\\" featurette.  Always wondered why you saw a different version of the movie on TV as opposed to the theatrical version on your then VHS?  Or what about that classic pic on the back of your VHS cover of Wanda (Tracey Lords) seductively lying in a large champagne glass that you never saw in the original?  And just what does the cast look like almost 15 years later?  Loads of deleted scenes and extras make this worth the wait for anyone who has grown to love this cult classic.  And the thought of John Waters playing with our emotions during the sit-down interview about bringing this movie, like Hairspray, to Broadway, makes you appreciate it all the more!
B000002UAX|5.0|In November of 1968, The Beatles released their fifteenth album entitled simply, THE BEATLES. This album has been most often referred to as \\"The White Album\\" because of its all-white cover. For this album, The Beatles left behind their cycodelic sound and went for just more advanced rock & roll. This album, taking up two discs, is just outstanding. There are songs on this album that are, indeed, brilliant songs, but at the same time, very strange. And yes, every song recorded for this album is on here, but because there are so many songs on here, the album takes up two discs, with the first 17 on the first disc and the last 13 on the second disc. <br /> <br />Disc One <br /> <br />BACK IN THE U.S.S.R. <br />  This song is my all-time favorite Beatles song. This song really rocks all out. What made me like this song was when Sigourney Weaver had to sing it in the Russian Restuarant scene in the comedy film, HEARTBREAKERS. This song is just outstanding and I am proud to call it my favorite Beatles song. <br /> <br />DEAR PRUDENCE <br />  This song is another classic. There's just something about this song that instantly drew me into it when I heard it for the first time. This is definitely a classic song. <br /> <br />GLASS ONION <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />OB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA <br />  Before I start, I'll help most of you out in pronouncing this song's title: OH BLA DEE, OH BLA DA. Make more sense now? I hope so. This song is just great. I can't help it. It is not the rock & roll sound they were going for, like the rest of this album, but this song is just great. I mean it's just fun, you know what I mean? I love this song. <br /> <br />WILD HONEY PIE <br />  Nothing special. Instrumental piece. A rather strange and unusual instrumental piece. <br /> <br />THE CONTINUING STORY OF BUNGALOW BILL <br />  A great song. I just hate the fact that Yoko Ono, put her backing vocals on this. How many of you Beatles fans here despise Yoko Ono? I sure as hell do. <br /> <br />WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS <br />  This is one of George Harrison's greatest songs ever. I never liked it at first, but the more I heard it, the more I began to like it. Great song. <br /> <br />HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN <br />  Great. <br /> <br />MARTHA MY DEAR <br />  Great. <br /> <br />I'M SO TIRED <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />BLACKBIRD <br />  I really enjoy hearing this song, but whenever my father's band plays their gigs, we ALWAYS hear someone requesting this song. Okay, we heard you request this song. \\"Blackbird\\" is not the only Beatles song out there. <br /> <br />PIGGIES <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />ROCKY RACCOON <br />  I could do without this song. <br /> <br />DON'T PASS ME BY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />WHY DON'T WE DO IT IN THE ROAD? <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />I WILL <br />  Great. <br /> <br />JULIA <br />  Great. <br /> <br />Disc Two <br /> <br />BIRTHDAY <br />  This is an excellent song and you'll most likely hear it when you give a surprise birthday party for a friend or family member. We had thrown my father a surprise 40th birthday about six years ago. He came in, we yelled out surprise, and the DJ threw on this song. It's a great song. <br /> <br />YER BLUES <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />MOTHER NATURE'S SON <br />  Great. <br /> <br />EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE EXCEPT FOR ME AND MY MONKEY <br />  Whew! Writing this song's title just exhausted me. That's a long title, it felt like I rain a staircase that had fifty steps included. Great song. <br /> <br />SEXY SADIE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />HELTER SKELTER <br />  Great song, but it gives me the creeps because Charles Manson, one of the 70s' ruthless serial killers, loved this song. <br /> <br />LONG, LONG, LONG <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />REVOLUTION <br />  This is a good song, but The Beatles re-recorded it after this version and then released the re-recorded version as the single. The single version is much better. <br /> <br />HONEY PIE <br />  Not bad. <br /><br />SAVOY TRUFFLE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />CRY BABY CRY <br />  Great. <br /> <br />REVOLUTION #9 <br />  Nothing special. Just stupid Yoko Ono playing around with this one. <br /> <br />GOOD NIGHT <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />    This was one hell of an album. I had heard that the songs on the second disc, which would be the second half of this album, they were gonna hold off as album cuts and then release them as songs for their next album.. They were going to call the first disc The White Album, release that, and ba-da-boom. That's that. Then they were going to release the second disc as another album and call it The Whiter Album. But they decided to make things easier by putting all thirty songs on both discs. Gotta love this album.
B000002OX7|5.0|It's their best.  No it's not as ambitious as the flawed but still brilliant concept albums Tommy or Quadrophenia. Who's Next isn't a concept album with some larger story to tell (although some of the tracks were taken from Pete's abandonned Lifehouse project), rather it's a collection of excellent songs that work on every level. The sum of the parts is greater than the whole. The playing is magnificent, Moony is especially on top of his game here. Pete's use of synthesizers was revolutionary for the day, and his guitar playing is as solid as ever. Entwhistle is Entwhistle, i.e. rocking and nimble and Daltrey nails the songs and puts in some of his best performances on Behind Blue Eyes. Their strongest studio album is also one of their best sounding due to the excellent recording and mix. Quite simply Who's Next is one of the top 10 rock albums of the '70s. And with the bonus tracks you've got an excellent album made that much better. What are you waiting for? It's the Who at the pinnacle of their game. Buy it now.
B000002JB3|4.0|In 1996, just three years after the release of his seventh album entitled, BOTH SIDES, Phil Collins released his eighth album entitled, DANCE INTO THE LIGHT. This album is not quite what Phil's previous albums were, but the album is a four star album, which is still a high rating, if you ask me. <br /> <br />DANCE INTO THE LIGHT <br />  The album's title track and apparently, the only hit from this album. This is a great song. <br /> <br />THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />LORENZO <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />JUST ANOTHER STORY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />LOVE POLICE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />WEAR MY HAT <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />IT'S IN YOUR EYES <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />OUGHTA KNOW BY NOW <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />TAKE ME DOWN <br />  First, Phil Collins wanted you to Take Him Home. Now, he wants you to Take Him Down. Great song. <br /> <br />SAME MOON <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />RIVER SO WIDE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />NO MATTER WHO <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />THE TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGIN' <br />  A cover of the old Bob Dylan classic. I never liked this song because I've always hated Bob Dylan. <br /> <br />    As I stated before, this album was not what I hoped it would be. I was hoping for something more than this, but the album gets four stars, a high rating in my opinion. But I am still going to ask all Phil Collins fans to add DANCE INTO THE LIGHT onto their list if they didn't already. So, get this album now.
B0001AP12G|5.0|They say that if an infinate amount of monkeys were typing on an infinate amount of typewriters then one of them would produce the best book ever written. Or something like that. Anyway, to make this album, Kanye West selected the more musically inclined monkeys, threw them in a recording studio and just let 'em rip it. Then he did some rhymes and stuff over the top because monkeys cant rap very well.
B000002UB3|5.0|In October of 1969, The Beatles released seventeenth album entitled, ABBEY ROAD. This album cover features the guys walking down Abbey Road, hense the album's title. This album is another one of The Beatles' greatest albums. Just about every song on here is worth your time. <br /> <br />COME TOGETHER <br />  This is one of those songs that I loved to hate, but after awhile, the song really grew on me, and now I cannot stop listening to it. <br /> <br />SOMETHING <br />  This is another one of George Harrison's best songs. Great song. <br /> <br />MAXWELL'S SILVER HAMMER <br />  This song is silly, but I can't help myself when I sing along with this one. <br /> <br />OH! DARLING <br />  No, this one is not \\"Oh Donna\\". \\"Oh Donna\\" was written and performed by the late Ritchie Valens. This song is totally different. This is song is just outstanding. <br /> <br />OCTOPUS'S GARDEN <br />  This was the last song written and sung by Ringo Starr. I love this song. This song is just great. <br /> <br />I WANT YOU (SHE'S SO HEAVY) <br />  Great song. <br /> <br />HERE COMES THE SUN <br />  When George Harrison's anniversary comes up, I will light a candle and play this song as a tribute to the Late Beatle. <br /> <br />BECAUSE <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />YOU NEVER GIVE ME YOUR MONEY <br />  This song, although 4 minutes & 2 seconds long, is actually fused together with four other songs, making it the \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" Medley. Great song. <br /> <br />SUN KING <br />  This is the second part to the YNGMYM Medley, where it ends at 2 minutes & 26 seconds, flowing into the next song in the medley . Great song. <br /> <br />MEAN MR. MUSTARD <br />  This is the third part to the YNGMYM Medley, where it ends at 1 minute & 6 seconds, flowing into the next song in the medley. Another great song. <br /> <br />POLYTHENE PAM <br />  This is the fourth part to the YNGMYM Medley, where it ends at 1 minute & 12 seconds, flowing into the final song in the medley. Great song. <br /> <br />SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW <br />  This is the fourth & final part to the YNGMYM Medley, where it ends at 1 minute & 57 seconds. This song, Paul had come up with when a female fan broke into his London home, by entering his bathroom window and stealing one his suits. He caught the girl and was gonna make her take it off and give it back to him, but he decided to let his fan have a genuine Paul McCartney suit. <br /> <br />GOLDEN SLUMBERS <br />  This next song is only 1 minute & 31 seconds long and that is because this is another Medley, making it the, \\"Golden Slumbers\\" Medley. This song is excellent, ending at 1 minute & 31 seconds, where it flows into the next song. <br /> <br />CARRY THAT WEIGHT <br />  This next song is only 1 minute & 16 seconds long, where it flows into the next song in the GS Medley. This song is excellent, where the guys sing one phrase from the song, \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\". <br /> <br />THE END <br />  This song begins with Ringo's infamous drum solo, leading into the guys saying over and over, \\"Love you\\". Then the piano comes in to officially begin \\"The End\\". This song ends at 2 minutes & 19 seconds, bringing a close to the GS Medley. <br /> <br />HER MAJESTY <br />  Not bad. <br /> <br />    This album is one The Beatles best albums and it will always be one of their best. ABBEY ROAD is a must-have Beatles item and all Beatles fans must have this album now or you'll be sorry if you don't have it already.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Back in 2004, being a big fan of Joss Whedon's shows \\"BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER\\" and \\"ANGEL\\", I decided I'd better pick up his failed sci-fi series, \\"FIREFLY\\".  My aunt bought it for me for my birthday, and I eventually began watching it.  The pilot, \\"Serenity\\", runs 85 minutes and I was bored through most of it.  Why had people been talking about this?   <br /> <br />A few months later, with nothing else to do, I decided to check out the rest of the series.  Oh, boy, am I glad I did. <br /> <br />\\"FIREFLY\\" is one of the greatest television series ever, a true masterpiece.  It dares to go where other shows will not - something that angered television executives when it was on the air.  It's set in a distant future, where sleazy corporations run the many different worlds in the universe.  Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) captains the Firefly-class spaceship \\"Serenity\\", which smuggles goods across planets while running from the Alliance.  In each episode, the crew is faced with a different problem, both off and on the ship. <br /> <br />This show is mind-blowing, absolutely and completely.  As with \\"BUFFY\\" and \\"ANGEL\\", Joss Whedon provides us with thought-out storylines, witty dialogue, and realistic characters whom we care about.  The casting is absolutely superb; each actor and actress brings their character to life perfectly.  The show is a science-fiction drama mixed with western action and grit.  Greg Edmonson's music is unique and entirely fitting; it really adds to the emotion. <br /> <br />Though each episode is nearly the same in quality, I would say that the best episode is \\"Out of Gas\\", a moving look at how Mal Reynolds first met the crew that he (and we) would come to love.  \\"The Message\\" has received much acclaim due to its beautiful cinematography, Emmy-worthy performances and very moving script.   <br /> <br />Out of the 14 outstanding episodes the set contains, only 11 were aired before the show's cancellation.  Why?  An excuse from the network was \\"viewers\\".  But can the viewers be blamed?  The network placed the episodes on Friday nights (a notorious time slot) and aired them out of sequence.  The network was afraid to do anything out of the ordinary.  Instead they would rather air \\"series\\" like \\"My Big Fat Obnoxious Husband\\".  Cancelling this series was one of the worst mistakes in television history.  I'm not the first one to say that it could have been the next \\"STAR TREK\\". <br /> <br />With a feature-length movie, \\"SERENITY\\", about to be released, two sequels being planned, and incredible DVD sales, this series will not be forgotten.  But that doesn't make its cancellation much easier to deal with.  By all means, pick up this absolutely fantastic series and show the television corporations what we REALLY want.
B000001G7C|4.0|Von Karajan is available on another CD with the Vienna instead of the Berlin. Both are wonderful choices in this music. This performance of the Swan and the Sleeping Beauty excerpts/suites show von Karajan at his best. If you are not a von Karajan fan you may be surprised at how impressive he is in the ballet music. The music itself is beyond praise. I am not so convinced by the Nutcracker performance on this issue - but it's difficult to imagine surpassing the two other suites, so you might consider the famous Christmas music a nice bonus.
0553381687|5.0|With the release of the 4th installment looming in the near future, I had heard a lot about the Song of Ice and Fire series the past few months. Without a current fantasy series to be engrossed in, I decided to pick this one up on the good words of so many, and was not disappointed in the least.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin creates a vivid and breath taking world, rich with history and full of vibrant life. You can almost see the banners waving in the wind as knights march across the fields.<br /><br />The main plot is told through the eyes of near a dozen different characters of all shapes, sizes and bloodlines. You'll be seeing the world according to a chivalrous lord of the land, his lady, his children, a despised son of royalty, a jilted beggered princess, and some of their servants and sworn guards.<br /><br />Despite the sudden and sometimes severe jumps into our new hosts, the story remains cohesive and interesting as it unravels before us.<br /><br />In A Game of Thrones, Martin sets the stage for chaos to break loose in the next installments. Armies are poised to strike, the small folk starve and rebel, and atrocities become common place, with the jaw dropping last chapter as a final mental hook to further drag you into the series, you'll find yourself engrossed and dying for more.<br /><br />I highly suggest this series to anyone who consider themselves a fantasy genre fan, or even a fiction fan in general, as the gritty realistic world (with few flights of magic) is beautifully realized.
B00006AVRK|5.0|This is just what I expected. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are very good in these series. I recomend this to anybody who is a fan of either one of them.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Radiohead is about 32 times better than this BS band and they were about 10 years ahead of their time (The Bends came out in 1995). And are still releasing amazing albums today.

0143034901|5.0|I usually only read boks by African Americans, but this is a great book about a book and all the lives it touch.
0786890754|5.0|I love this book, I just couldn't put it down, I was totally wrapped up in her life from start to finish. I found myself crying while reading it on my way to work and couldn't wait to find out what message was waiting for her in the next envelope. It was so sad to think that when her husband was on his death bed, he took some time out to write all these messages to her, which helped through the grieve and recovery process. I seriously love this book and I recommend it to everyone to read, both young and old. This book really does explain true love and how it lingers on forever, even when that person is no longer there. The novel truly touched every person who reads it and I recommend it to everyone.
B000003TA4|5.0|In 1991,many pop/rock songs were recorded using the sound of the late 1980's digital percussion. Since Nirvana debuted that same year,many artists like Soundgarden,Green Day and Blues Traveller were copying Nirvana's style. Now for the songs:SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT was the biggest hit from this album. COME AS YOU ARE was another hit. I also like IN BLOOM,BREED and SOMETHING IN THE WAY. This album inspired \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's OFF THE DEEP END album,released in 1992. That album contains SMELLS LIKE NIRVANA which is a parody of SLTS. When Yankovic sings \\"a garage band from Seattle\\",he refers to Nirvana. The cover photo(from this album) is actually X-rated. There's a naked male baby under swimming pool water intending to grab a dollar bill attached to a hook and fishing line. Sure,it would have been controversial if it was an adult. On the OTDE cover,Yankovic spoofs the NEVERMIND cover by grabbing a donut attached to a hook and fishing line. And yes,Yankovic is wearing a bathing suit. In one of the photos contained in this album,the band's late frontman Kurt Cobain \\"flips the bird\\". Cobain's fame only lasted over two years,as he committed suicide in April 1994. Surviving are his wife rocker/actress Courtney Love who's a member of Hole and their daughter Frances Bean,who is currently about 12 or 13 years old. Cobain's death put an end to Nirvana,and another Nirvana member,Dave Navarro,subsequently co-founded and co-formed Foo Fighters. This album was distributed by DGC,which is an acronym for David Geffen Company. DGC's sister label is simply,Geffen which was founded in 1980. Geffen's other clientele,past and present,includes the late John Lennon,Don Henley,Elton John,Guns 'n Roses,Edie Brickell,Bill Cosby and Cher.
B000002572|5.0|The debut album by Boston shows a rock band from the late 70's flirting with some new technology and methods that made their arena/hard rock sound more polished and loud than previous bands before. Though Boston could be known as a producers band, or a band that used the studio to maximum efficiency, they didn't overdo the slick polish, and in essence, the raw guitar attack that trademarked late 70's/early 80's FM Album Rock is retained, with an original flair and energy. <br /> <br />What makes the debut stunning besides the high use of studio theatrics by a hard rock band (not heard of back in that time by hard rockers, unless you call ELO \\"hard\\" rockers) is the high number of stellar cuts on the album. \\"More Than A Feeling\\" takes a love ballad and turns it rocking good time. \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" is a traditional classic rock motif of a band going for a long instrumental interlude along with the song, almost not heard of anymore in music. \\"Smokin'\\" is a high octane song that is meant to get you pumped up and just have fun rocking out. \\"Rock and Roll Band\\" is the story of the band, and how they got to where they were at that time. \\"Peace of Mind\\" is a song that takes on the subject of uncertainity in a relationship. \\"Hitch a Ride\\" is the last stellar cut on the album, another guitar driven song that could get you pumped up. <br /> <br />All the songs tie in together with the overall theme of celebration and good times. There is nothing too deep or socially conscious about the album, more it shows a young, new band excited to bring new rock and roll to fans. In an era where disco and punk were topping record sales, the album sold millions to those deprived of fresh rock, rock that sounded like a packed stadium show thanks to the magic of the studio. This album is one of the definitions of album rock: a band who created an album that told a complete story instead of just hit singles that were randomly placed together. Though they would never get back to the greatnessthat this album showed, they made some random stabs at success, including the surprising hit single \\"Amanda\\" in 1986. Still, with such a strong debut statement that they made in 1978, it's hard to not be disappointed that they never could get to the stage of greatness they showed with their introductory album.
0812550706|5.0|I have read a lot of sci-fi books that had action in them because I am a huge Star wars fan. So I know what Sci-Fi with action should be like.  <br />This book went into a lot of depth about being taken from family at such a young age and relationships growing or worsening overtime. Ender Wiggen goes through the hardships of life in the course of 10 years. Many people don't go through what he goes through in their entire lifetime.  <br />Ender learns how to deal with many problems including isolation and the bugger threat. Throughout the book the topic of his family comes up and many interesting characters are introduced. All the characters end up teaching Ender a lesson about himself.  <br />The book shows strong character bonds not just with main characters but other characters too. If you are interested in Sci-Fi or not this book is a good read.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Shakira es la Mejor!!! Now that I am done practicing spanish I am going to switch to my native english.  This CD is excellent and I would be missing part of my life if I had never listened to Shakira.  I first heard her in Mexico this summer and since then I have been hooked.  Everyone should hear this CD and know that the best songs are numbers 3, 6, and 9!!! The talent of Shakira will live forever.  Vive Shakira!!!
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This is the first QOTSA cd I ever listened to, so ymmv.   <br /> <br />That said, louder-the-better pop rock really doesn't get any better than this.  Much superior to any previous work.  Olivetti, whoever he is, be damned. <br /> <br />Weird intro, from which the album seems to move up to some pretty straight-ahead, chest-front, good ol' fashioned R&R.  A slight hint of the best to come with \\"Tangled Up in Plaid,\\" a dig at the great old Dylan song.  All the (now) mainstream goodness ends with \\"Little Sister,\\" though, and Lullabies then gets to its very best work. <br /> <br />The groove is sunk at \\"The Blood is the Love,\\" and the remainder follows the path into weird, loud, dreamy, loud, joyful, loud, bizarre, loud, great stuff.   <br /> <br />This album is so good it's one you gotta discipline yourself to listen to only once a week or else.  Top volume, highest recommendation.
0345440900|5.0|This is a fantastic middle of the road approach to how to live with a baby in our modern, hectic lives. It was written in an easy, down to earth tone that made it an easy read. When I finished I thought, \\"I can do this\\". I have read two other books on methods by Sears and Ferber but just could not relate to those two extreme views of how to raise your child. We are going to be a first time parents and look forward to trying this method once our son arrives.

B0006IUDXA|4.0|Watching MacGyver Series on Saturday evenings is an unforgettable memory for most Taiwanese teenagers born in the 1970s and 80s. The DVDs bring those memories back to me, when once again I heard the familiar themes and music of the stories. MacGyver is really a memory teaser!
015603008X|5.0|<br />Okay, this might sound like blasphemy to all the Dan Keyes fans, but there's a similar book out there that at least one critic thinks is actually better than Flowers for Algernon. Tim Lasiuta, editor at penguincomics.net, is that guy. Now, I've been a fan of Flowers for Algernon since I was a kid, and found the claim to be audacious, maybe even foolhardy. After all, didn't Keyes' book win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards? Didn't Cliff Robertson love the story so much, he produced and starred in the novel-inspired movie \\"Charly,\\" which won him the Oscar for best actor? Hasn't the book sold millions of copies in dozens of languages, and continue to sell well today? How dare Tim Lasiuta claim there's a better book! So I bought the book- An Audience for Einstein, by new author Mark Wakely- and I read it with a skeptical eye, fully expecting to prove Mister Lasiuta wrong. So I finished Wakely's book, and now I have just one thing to say to Lasiuta, just one thing:  <br /> <br />You're right.  <br /> <br />If there was ever a \\"must-read\\" for fans of Keyes' book, An Audience for Einstein is it.  Do yourself a favor and read it. <br />
0920668364|5.0|This book is a perfect gift for new parents, teachers, any age mother in the world.  Great lesson and morals and ethics!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great DVD...studio quality sound and great video presentation, not jumping around every two seconds like some concert DVD productions do.  Will make the casual listener to Eagles music a fan of them.  Best vocal harmonies in the business. Very dynamic band: Henley, Frey, Schmitt, and Walsh each have unique and diverse talents. This DVD is worth purchasing, it will stay on top of your DVD stack in your entertainment room.
B00003CX9E|1.0|Help, bless me, so help me I have tried and tried and tried and tried to sit through this film many, many times.  I am an inveterate classic movie lover.  I own a huge collection of VHS and DVD classic films.  You name it, I probably have it.  NOT THIS ONE, though.  As I said before, I have tried to watch this film many, many times and I fall asleep within the first twenty minutes.  To say this it is overrated is an understatement in my opinion.  Classic it may be but it certainly doesn't deserve the title of the best film ever made.  How can we honestly compare this to the grandeur and scope of \\"Gone With the Wind\\", \\"The Sound of Music\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", or \\"The Ten Commandments\\"?  There aren't even any big names so to speak of in this film.  Why haven't I been able to get into it??  Perhaps I just don't understand its message.  Perhaps the slow moving plot is to blame.  Perhaps I need to try (for the umpteenth time) to sit fully through one showing??  I think not.  This is not to detract from those who love this film.  Obviously it is much loved by a lot of people.  And I can understand it making the top ten list of classic movies (but not by my vote).  My vote for the top ten greatest Films ever made:  1)  The Wizard of Oz  2)  The Sound of Music  3)  Gone With the Wind  4)  The Ten Commandments  5)  Titanic (1997 version)  6) The Grapes of Wrath (1940), 7) Psycho (1960), 8) Singin' In the Rain, 9) Forrest Gump and 10)  The Song of Bernadette (1943).  I think I'll go watch one of those instead of Citizen Kane....unless I have trouble falling asleep.
B000068TPN|4.0|The movie was a bit PC in the end (and I believe not faithful to the book in that regard) but the dedication of the troops and the confusion of war are well shown. And as an added bene, the music is  among the best sound track music I've heard in terms of inspirational and uplifting.
0440237688|5.0|Science fiction is the mythology of the present, giving us intuitions about current conditions in an age of continual change. Lowry's book as not about the future, but about society today. <br /> <br />In Lowry's society, suffering is illegal and must be eliminated -- if it can't be, the response is euthanasia. Jonas  hurts his finger - an ambulance is called, and he must be given an anesthetic that totally relieves the pain. A jet pilot mistakenly overflies Jonas' small, self-contained community; the pilot is liable to undergo an intolerable level of embarrassment, and must therefore be \\"separated\\" from his community -- a euphemism for euthanasia. Children who aren't judged to have sufficiently bonded with family units, and elders who reach an age which is judged to have \\"life unworthy of life\\", are euthanized. <br /> <br />Our response to people who are undergoing suffering which makes us uncomfortable, is not to become truly \\"compassionate\\" (suffering-with), but, really driven by a sense of our own intolerable discomfort, our response is to eliminate suffering at its root, by eliminating the sufferer. Pope John-Paul II speaks of the fact that in \\"...a social and cultural context which makes it more difficult to face and accept suffering, the temptation becomes all the greater to resolve the problem of suffering by eliminating it at the root, by hastening death so that it occurs at the moment considered most suitable.  <br /> <br />\\"Various considerations usually contribute to such a decision, all of which converge in the same terrible outcome. In the sick person the sense of anguish, of severe discomfort, and even of desperation brought on by intense and prolonged suffering can be a decisive factor. Such a situation can threaten the already fragile equilibrium of an individual's personal and family life, with the result that, on the one hand, the sick person, despite the help of increasingly effective medical and social assistance, risks feeling overwhelmed by his or her own frailty; and on the other hand, those close to the sick person can be moved by an understandable even if misplaced compassion. All this is aggravated by a cultural climate which fails to perceive any meaning or value in suffering, but rather considers suffering the epitome of evil, to be eliminated at all costs. This is especially the case in the absence of a religious outlook which could help to provide a positive understanding of the mystery of suffering. <br /> <br />\\"On a more general level, there exists in contemporary culture a certain Promethean attitude which leads people to think that they can control life and death by taking the decisions about them into their own hands. What really happens in this case is that the individual is overcome and crushed by a death deprived of any prospect of meaning or hope. We see a tragic expression of all this in the spread of euthanasia -- disguised and surreptitious, or practised openly and even legally. As well as for reasons of a misguided pity at the sight of the patient's suffering, euthanasia is sometimes justified by the utilitarian motive of avoiding costs which bring no return and which weigh heavily on society. Thus it is proposed to eliminate malformed babies, the severely handicapped, the disabled, the elderly, especially when they are not self-sufficient, and the terminally ill.\\" <br /> <br />Palliative medical care has become so sophisticated that in reality no sick person need undergo an intolerable level of pain. But those who refuse to engage in real, personal relationships with suffering people can't expect to understand, either the ill person's need for palliative care or for counseling to deal with depression. Those who are uncomfortable with other people's condition should deal with their own discomfort, not try to eliminate the discomfort by eliminating the suffering person.  <br />
0385338686|3.0|I love love love the Shopaholic series, and coming into this book, I expected nothing less of a new character with a new personality and story to tell.  Although the book was amusing and entertaining, I thought the plot line was a little too far-fetched and unrealistic.  Kinsella often exaggerates or stretches a situation to the point where it's almost unbelieveable, but in the Undomestic Goddess, it's really over the top.  Most of the time, this works to the characters advantage, because it makes the story funny and comical, but I found it to be almost unrealistically stupid at times.<br /><br />With that said, overall the book is still a fun one.  This was perfect for reading on the beach, or even just under the covers in bed until the sun comes up.
B0000714BP|5.0|Good acting, hiliarious, interesting story line, and absolutely entertaining. Definitely watch it.
076790592X|1.0|The fact that this book lacks any redeeming features whatsoever may be forgivable; what are not defensible are the rave reviews the majority of the reading public has given it. This is a cause for major depression.  To think that the public is so lacking in discriminative values is frightening.<br /><br />There are no words to describe the mental degradation that this author goes to in his presentation of Morrie. And if the sickening, cheap sentimental narrative style of this book doesn't make you want to throw-up and take a shower to cleanse yourselves from its polluting drivel, then you folk out there have a serious problem.<br /><br />Yes, I am sorry that Morrie died, but surprise, surprise... we all eventually do, and you know what, if you haven't worked out the simplistic truths expounded in this \\"incredible treasure\\" of a book by age twelve, you have been looking in the wrong direction for \\"life's greatest lesson\\".<br /><br />I am obliged by Amazon to rate this book with one star at least but let it be known that this one star is several light years away from the black hole where I would like to place it. Yes, I know that I am being judgmental but this excrement makes for a very special exception.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|When you sit down to watch a movie like XXX: State of the Union, you know you won't be seeing CITIZEN KANE, or even DIE HARD.  You expect fast, silly, explosive action.  Not a lot of exposition, not a lot of rich characterization.  And on that count, XXX II succeeds.  Unfortunately, it is also a hamfisted bore.<br /><br />There are plenty of explosions, guns-firing, & cars and boats doing ridiculous things.  All well and good.  Sounds like a James Bond movie (which, you may remember, the original XXX was supposed to be...a Bond for this generation.  Ironically, the \\"old-school\\" Bond still does better.).  But where Bond movies have some charm, some energy and some originality (the silliness factor in Bond movies is always overshadowed by the \\"how did they think of that\\" factor), XXX seems confused and needlessly loud.  And one of the biggest stunts, involving a speedboat jumping onto a bridge of car traffic comes right from LIVE AND LET DIE...a Bond flick that's what, 30 YEARS OLD?  Yes, this movie has a more throbbing sound mix, better crunching of innocent cars, but the basic idea for the stunt has a very tired feel...as does its execution.<br /><br />The story, about how the Secretary of Defense is planning a coup in which he'll overthrow the compromise-with-terrorists-minded president wants to be thrilling and high-stakes.  But not for one minute is the method for accomplishing this overthrow of government believable.  An action movie of this ilk MUST make us suspend our disbelief.  We never say to ourselves...\\"yeah, this could happen.\\" But we should say, \\"I'm gonna enjoy this and see where it takes us.\\"  In XXX, the best I usually mustered was...\\"it's gotta get better, right?\\"<br /><br />But plot concerns aside, the movie isn't even fun on an \\"actors having fun\\" level.  Ice Cube, who can be somewhat charming in the right vehicle, plays a hardened con / former Navy SEAL, who gets a shot at redemption by becoming the new XXX.

B000021Y77|5.0|I see hundreds of movies a year, but somehow, I had managed to miss RUN LOLA RUN until the first week in August, 2005.  YEARS after the film had come out, and years after imitators had their shots at ruining the style (like imitators of PULP FICTION kinda cheapened that whole genre).  Not to fear...this film is a kick of PURE ENERGY!!<br /><br />I felt honest-to-God jazzed watching this movie.  Originality and ENERGY pop off the screen.  Basically, we're watching three little movies...each of the same scenario, but playing out in different ways.  We see how one or two tiny little changes early on can snowball into HUGE changes once the story reaches its end.  Lola has to come up with a HUGE pile of money in 20 minutes flat, or her boyfriend will either be killed by a mobster, or take the foolish step of holding up a grocery store for the cash.  Can she \\"fix\\" his problem in time?  That's about the plot...but this summary tells you NOTHING about how this film feels.<br /><br />I'm a 41 year old man.  Not the target audience.  I don't listen to the kind of music played here (techno...for lack of a better word).  I speak some German, but not enough that I didn't have to read the subtitles.  I always look for holes in the plot of films.  I'm always skeptical of \\"artiness for its own sake.\\"  And yet, while the film is \\"artful,\\" I thought it was a perfect blending of a filmmaking style with a story-telling intent.  Lola is under a deadline...and everything reminds us of that.  The pulsing, repetitive score...the fast camera work...the color choices...everything.<br /><br />But the best part of all is Franke Potente, the star of the film.  US audiences know her from the \\"girlfriend\\" role in BOURNE IDENTITY...and she was the best cast part of the film...she seemed real, smart, sexy, foreign and fully-realized.  In RUN LOLA RUN, she shows why an American director casting a big-budget American film would have gone with her...she's GREAT!  The film spends many minutes focused just on Lola running.  From the side, from head-on...we see her run, run, run.  Red/pink hair sailing wildly behind.  Her face is a masterpiece...at one moment she's got fear, intelligence, determination and exhaustion etched there.  She's very young, and in over her head...but we immediately want her to succeed as much as SHE wants to succeed.  It's a riveting performance in a film full of fun ideas.<br /><br />If I sit back and think about it...I realize that what Lola is running for is to save a criminal boyfriend (who's also stupid and a bit of a whiner), and that performing criminal acts is not beyond her either.  Most of the characters she encounters along her way (especially her father and his mistress), are quite unlikeable too.  From a surface level, we should have NO business getting behind these schmucks.  But Lola's ferocity is an undeniable magnet.  And the film moves WAY too fast to do anything but leave you breathless.<br /><br />It's rated \\"R,\\" mostly for some strong language, and for some unsavory scenes with the father and mistress.  I don't recommend it by any stretch for kids...but I suggested it to my 17 year old son, and he loved it.  He's showing it to his friends.  It's a COOL movie...simply put.

0793518326|5.0|\\"The Beatles - Complete Scores\\" is almost certainly the best popular printed music collection ever produced.  It has every single Beatles song, wonderfully (though not perfectly) and completely transcribed.  Ever tried to figure out the Bach trumpet part to Penny Lane?  It's here.  The competing guitar solos in \\"The End\\"?  Here.  Clapton's wailing licks on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\"?  You got it. <br /> <br />Every instrument, every solo, backing vocals, rhythm tracks. <br /> <br />I really struggle to come up with any complaints.  There are a few (but only a few) transcriptions that seem to deviate from the original recording.  The piano introduction to \\"Sexy Sadie\\", for instance, is a bit off. <br /> <br />But these are only minor quibbles.  I purchased \\"Complete Scores\\" about 7 or 8 years ago and have cherished it ever since.  Forget every other Beatles folio and splurge for this one.  You won't be sorry. <br /> <br />I can only hope that the publisher will do this for other artists.
B0009S2T0M|4.0|Living in Seoul I get to see many movies such as Old Boy before they ever get press in the USA. Old Boy is a classic here but has inspired many other films that are good in their own right. There are other films that I think set the tone for the Korean Film Industry and those include R-Point, Phone, Silmido, and JSA. Living in Korea for a few years has given me a small view into the Psyche here and you can expect many other great films to follw those that you already know about from the Land of the Morning Calm. Old Boy plays on many of the fears in Korean society and brings to light depth of talent we see from many Korean Actors here. I would reccomend that you see this movie and also check out many other Korean movies if you have the chance.
B000A59PMO|5.0|[...] \\"Best. Show. Ever. Seriously, I've never gotten more wrapped up in a show I wasn't making, and maybe even more than those. Crazy crisp dialogue. Incredibly tight plotting.

These guys know what they're doing on a level that intimidates me. It's the Harry Potter of shows. There. I said it. People should do whatever they can to check out this first season so the second won't be a spoiler fest. I'm nutty.\\"    Amen to that. Watch this show!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was an avowed Star Trek fan and thought no science-fiction series could ever be better ... until I saw Firefly.  Star Trek and Star Wars both pale in comparison.  John Updike said that Firefly is both the best science fiction and best western television show ever broadcast, and he is right. Set far in the future when humanity has occupied multiple planets formed into an \\"alliance\\", Firefly is a transport spaceship that operates at the outer edge of the Alliance where the settlements are fairly new and still developing, much like the Old West in America.  The characters have depth of personality, the stories are actually interesting, and the music is fantastic.  Watch Firefly and you'll be hooked, even if you aren't a big science fiction buff; the stories are that interesting and the acting is that well done.  Do not pass this one by.

With that said, this is the _only_ rock album from 2004 that I still listen to regularly.

Don't believe me? Listen to the whole disk through, you'll be hooked.
0553801546|5.0|Robin Hobb, Fool's Fate (Bantam, 2004)<br /><br />I have been immersed in the Six Duchies and its southern cousin Bingtown for two years and six thousand, three hundred thirty-three pages. I turned the last page on Fool's Fate at about 10:15 this morning and felt a small but undeniable sense of loss. Robin Hobb has said in interviews that she's finished with this particular world, and it's somewhat hard knowing we won't be going back for new adventures. (That said, \\"next generation\\" series of novels do tend to not live up to their predecessors, except in the rarest of cases.)<br /><br />With all that weight, both physical and metaphorical, settling on the shoulders of the six hundred-odd pages to be found here, Fool's Fate not only had a lot to live up to where its predecessors were concerned, but was also tasked with finishing the series in a manner worthy of it. With so many recent fantasy series sliding far downhill into their dotage (I'm sure I don't need to mention any names, take any series that's gone more than seven or eight books in the past few years), I think I may have actually gone into Fool's Fate with slightly lowered expectations. What I ended up reading was not only up to par with the rest of the books, but was, in fact, the best book in the series. Not only does Hobb manage to tie up loose ends most readers won't even realize were loose ends, but she does so with a surprising, and quite pleasing, lack of drama; one particular twist-tie spanned all of two sentences-- and was one of the book's most jaw-dropping revelations. (Those who've gone through the series will probably recognize what I'm talking about without my having to drop hints. I don't want to, as even the barest hint will spoil the incredible surprise.) Meditating on the deeper meanings to be found in those two sentences will give the astute reader a good deal to think about regarding how meticulously the payoff of Fool's Fate was planned, and how long she's been aiming at some of these targets. She hits every last one of them with precision.<br /><br />I have not read a fantasy novel this accomplished, and with such a perfect ending, since Pullman's The Amber Spyglass five years ago. (I should note that \\"ending\\" is something of a misnomer, as it spans about a hundred fifty pages.) If you have not yet read Robin Hobb's fantastic trilogy of trilogies about the Six Duchies and Bingtown, you owe it to yourself. It's a six-thousand-plus page investment, but not only is every page worth it, the payoff approaches perfection. *****ese targets.

B00097A5HW|4.0|After the HUGE dissapointment(for me) that was Laundry Service, with it's weak English lyrics and pretty generic English songs, I anticipated to hear Shakis in Spanish again.  <br /> <br />This album really impressed me. Shakira has delicately weaved in many different types of sounds to create a wonderful blend of pop/rock/Latin-American rhythms.  <br /> <br />People should be forewarned however- this is VERY different from her previous work, and definitely not as commercial sounding as Laundry Service. Most of the songs are slow love songs, something I think lots of people did not expect and hence why they did not like the album.  <br /> <br />It is however a solid, unique piece of work...totally recommended for people who appreciate unique music that stands out from the repetitive pop crap being produced today.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|3.0|This film is worth seeing if you are interested in films or want to persue a career in movies. I am just going to say first that I am not a Republican or a Democrat. I'm an independent. So when I saw this movie I came from an un-bias point of view. Rating a film is hard, esspecially a film like this, where there are so many counter-acting views. That said, when you really examine this film, it is certainly not a good as Bowling for Columbine or Roger and Me. The problem here is that Michael Moore, like most people, choses only on side to look at. Despite what Pro-Gun people said about Bowling for Columbine, that was a very important and well done documentery about guns and their influnce on our culture. Not that the film didn't have its flaws, but really, what film doesn't. When it comes to this movie, though, Moore seems to have already chosen what the movie would support and what the movie would denouce. What I think he should have done, and this is just my opinion, is to have examine both sides of the issue over Iraq, homeland security, the 2000 election, etc. When it came to Iraq, he forgot that the only reason it was really a soverign nation was because Saddam Hussien chose to make \\"his country\\" a soverign nation. When it came to homeland sercurity, he only showed us only one place where there is a problem with homeland security, expecting us to think that all homeland security is just as bad. It is in poor condition, but that doesn't mean that you should only focus on the negitive. His issue with the disenfranchisment of more than serveral thousand African-Americans was a much stronger point, considering the substancial evidence. The problem with that is usually it's the groups who are incharge of trying to elect the President who do that sort of dirty work, the same ones who stuffed the Chicago ballot boxes for JFK. They would probably not involve a canidate when it comes to illegal tactics like that, because then the President could say that he had no knowlege of such activities. I could be wrong, but I think that what they did because that is an old polictical technique. All in all, this movie didn't really examine the entire picture, chosing only to focus on certain things. I think Michael Moore should remember, you don't really know other people untill you've walked a mile in their shoes. That's a lesson that I think we should all learn.
0790729601|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent.  I really like the action and dedication of how the plot went.  It was fun and I was on the edge of my seat while I watched it.  Definetly a worth while invesment to watch as Arnold Schwarzenegger  did a great job.  If you like action adn suspense, this is your movie.

Sweet harmonies that bring \\"Simon and Garfunkel\\" to mind and poppy vocals not heard since \\"Nick Drake's Bryter Layter.\\"  Im so glad I have this in my collection, Also, Lesie Feist adds a jazzy touch to this album that I adore.  A must buy chillin' out album!

B0007GAERG|5.0|Well, this may be more of a review of Mariah in general...but first I will say Mariah's newest audio effort, The Emancipation of Mimi is really very striking and wonderful as far as hip pop music circa 2005...it certainly succeeds as a good time fun pop album by one of music's most brilliant and beautiful voices.  Highpoints on the album are 'We Belong Together' (~the lyrics are hot and tight, e.g. 'throwin things/cryin/tryin/to figure out where the hell i went wrong'--and I absolutely love when she lets loose vocally in the second half) is a wonderful song that continues to burn a bright light on the billboard charts some 11 weeks later...kudos to you girl!  The whole album shines in its production and hipness.  Other wonderful songs are Circles, Joy Ride (listen for the most hauntingly beautiful and long note on this song-at around 3:48 or so, pure genius by Mariah. <br /> <br />So overall, Mariah is a true singer and star, and mostof all, an artist.  Her voice is hauntingly beautiful on many slow tracks (check out O Holy night on Merry Christmas---this song sends chills throughout my body, it is beautiful even if you aren;t religious...the point is that she has a unique gift... <br /> <br />Keep singing and writing, Mariah---the world needs you!!!!!!!!
B000000132|5.0|JW jr-in fact the albums back cover states in the credits: \\"thanks to Albinoni for COLD IS BEING, and Jehan Alain for the opening piece on RUNNING HARD.\\" <br />THE SUNKEN CATHEDRAL brackets AT THE HARBOUR on ASHES ARE BURNING, thought I dont believe they gave credit on that. <br /> <br />Having a 1st run of the UK BTM/RCA pressing, I can attest to the higher sonic qualities of the thicker vinyl, pressed with much more care than the mass produced tupperware-lids released here in the US. In fact, as I got it home, I could smell the ink, and feel its texture on the cover. In the UK, many LP covers were actual works of art, with textured or finished card stock, fine inks, often devoid of group name or company logos, and were very close to being 'hand-made' up until the mid-1970's.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|These guys are amazing.  When they switched record labels I was nervous they might be changing their sound.  Well, I was right, they did change their sound, but for the better.  Songs like Sidewinder totally blow me away (listen to the mexican-style guitar solo at the end), Sieze the Day never gets old, Betrayed is awesome, every song (with maybe the exception of Beast and the Harlot) is great.   <br /> <br />What impresses me most about A7X is the variety in their music.  Every song has a similar feel, but all are unique.  I love this CD and would reccomend it to anyone.
B00007GZR5|4.0|This item was received in great condition.  Movie was good alos.
B0002J4X1Q|1.0|Resident Evil is an onion of stupidity. It's just layer after layer after layer of the most retarded plot points, character dialogue and CG that I have ever been forced to sit through.    The story goes that under the streets of Racoon City there is a secret facility (The Hive) controlled by Umbrella (a massive pharmacutical company) which is designed for creating vast viral weaponry.  An outbreak occurs turing all the staff into flesh hungry zombies.    Now to get to the aspects of the film that made it so god-awful.  I'm pretty much going to ruin the ending for anyone reading further than here so if you haven't seen the film and actually care about the end don't read any further. Repeat MAJOR SPOILERS!    The outbreak occurs when Spencer shatters a vial of T-virus against a lab table on his way out of the Hive. The icicle virus melts, the water evaporates and carries viral particles through the air vents, infecting the entire staff.    Do you have any idea how unrealistic and stupid it is to have a facility where it's cubicles share the same air as laboratories working with Level 4 biohazards?!?    Next, the security team successfully infiltrates the Hive in order to stop Red Queen (the main computer) who has killed all the inhabitants in order to contain the outbreak.  Does Red Queen greet the Umbrella personnel and explain her actions to them? Does she reveal ANY helpful information to these people who in all respects she should view as her masters?? NO!  First she slaughters half the team in a laser grid based trap, and says \\"You're all going to die down here.\\" The laser trap was stupid because there is an area of about 3 feet by the entrance to Red Queen's chamber where the laser grids can't reach. The leader of the security group is safe for a bit and actually backs up so he can get cut to pieces like the rest of his team.    Then after all the zombies have been released, you see these shambling corpses with bite marks, and half eaten faces. This makes no sense as everyone was killed by Red Queen at the same time. So they all should have become zombies at the same time, which would give them no reason to feed on one another.    The whole Alice in Wonderland fixation is a waste as well.  Elevator behind the mirror (looking glass), main character's name (Alice), going underground/down the rabbit hole), Red Queen. This doesn't help to forward or support the storyline in any way. It was all fun and cryptic in The Matrix, but it's pretty obvious the story writers just ripped it off.    This movie was the worst zombie film I have seen next to RE Apocalypse. This movie isn't worth buying, it isn't worth renting, it isn't worth the DVD is was burned to. Save you cash and your time.
080726203X|5.0|The narrator did a great job on this book. It was read very well and i was surprised at how good it was. I liked it a lot. The book \\"The Giver\\" is written for adults and children. It starts off very suave and almost irritating but then the plot thickens. Lois Lowry is an extremely educated writer and he knows his vocab, that's for sure. This book deserves more than it got. It had a smaller following than i would have thought.<br /><br />If you were interested in Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings than you shouldn't expect the same thrills as those books. This book is a fantasy but not like those at all. It involves a community where nothing goes wrong and everything is so perfect. The way the children talk to eachother is the most interesting thing.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Basic Plot: When a brother and sister driving along a desolate desert road witness what appears to be a man dumping corpses down a chute in the ground, they attempt to investigate. What they find is a horrific surprise. But even after they flee in terror from the hellish scene, the mysterious man catches up with them. They soon find themselves out in the middle of nowhere with their only company as a few locals and the baffled small-town police. There is nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Before long, they discover the vicious predator isn't even human. And, to put the icing on the dreadful cake, the answers of why it is here and what it wants are revealed!<br /><br />Few modern-day horror films include original, interesting, and iconic monsters. Well, Jeepers Creepers does! Although a superb cast and talented crew contribute to the greatness, the best part about it is the creature itself. Despite a few scenes (that are actually so realistic you can't tell CGI is used), the monster is the product of a very believeable full-body-suit, not cheap computer tricks. Before the inhuman identity is revealed of The Creeper, it's wardrobe is eye-poppingly awesome. Like the darkest of the darkest superheros, his long trench-coat flaps in the wind and his rugged hat shades his evil face. Like some kind of demon-cowboy, he's intimidating to the characters, yet mesmerizing to the audience. Eventually, of course, the clothing comes off and one hell of a creature is presented. I won't give a description of that -- you've got to see it for yourself. All I can say is that monster fans will not be disappointed!<br /><br />In short conclusion, this is a great comeback for the old-fashioned creature flicks. It's not very scary, but it's a whole lot of fun! Jeepers Creepers excludes over-the-top gore and sexuality, trading in another cliche storyline for an unforgettable experience of pure monster mayhem.

B000244FDW|5.0|Miss Austen will never be nailed down by one dvd or another, and it  is a waste of time to try. <br /> <br />The Colin Firth one is fine, but I distrust the \\"star quality\\" of the characters.  In those days, only a few strived to be stars...for most of them knew they were stars already.  Therefore, like stars, they were content to mute their light. <br /> <br />Which happens in this version, which I love, which lets the characters' intelligence outshine their looks, which is, I expect, what Miss Austen wanted. <br /> <br />Deprive yourself not; get both.  And read the book again.
B0006L16N8|5.0|To argue and debate and critique music is like debating in different languages. <br /> <br />The problem lies in what your definition of \\"quality\\" is. <br /> <br />You will like this album if: <br /> <br />1)  You like \\"hooks\\", melodies, consise song structures. <br /> <br />2)  You don't mind super vague and sentimental lyrics. <br /> <br />3)  You don't mind conservative music and non-experimental songs. <br /> <br />You will not like this album if: <br /> <br />1)  You NEED progressive, groundbreaking sounds/intrumentation. <br /> <br />2)  You NEED lyrical depth in the style of Dylan, or even Radiohead. <br /> <br />3)  You NEED your music to be super hip and underground. <br /> <br /> <br />So essentially arguments about this album seem to be between two (or more) musical cultures. <br /> <br />I prefer music with an experimental edge, but that still has it's roots in strong melody.  (Like Radiohead) <br /> <br />BUT, the melodies are SOOOO good here, I can allow the lack of experiemtnation to pass. <br /> <br />I have a feeling people will still be playing some of these songs in 50 years. <br /> <br />Almost every tune on \\"X and Y\\" has a super-memorable melody and hook, and that ultimately is a quality album in my book.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I call this little review \\"It must be hard to be a hater\\" for a couple of reasons.  Primarily, because I have been one myself, of Mariah Carey that is.  It has taken this album, which I regard as one of the best albums of 2005 so far, to change that.    Let us get one thing straight right from the beginning.  There are and should be no comparisons between Mariah Carey and Beyonce.  Two different artists, two completely different styles and vocal types.  Its actually a bit of an insult for anyone over the age of 25 who owns any one of Mariah Carey's earliest recordings, to make such inaccurate comparisons.  Please don't misunderstand, I happen to like Beyonce, but let's not kid ourselves people into thinking for ONE fleeting moment, that Beyonce has a fraction of the vocal staying power and elegance that Mariah Carey has possessed for the last, count them, 15 years.  Let us please come to terms with one fact, without Mariah Carey, there would be no Beyonce.  We would not be able to appreciate her, which is probably the reason why we make these ridiculous analogies.  Besides the fact that Beyonce's multi-platinum \\"Dangerously In Love\\" has about 4 good songs on it, all of which she released.  The rest of the album is rather boring and uneventful.    And what's with all of the comments on her collaborations with other R&B and hip/hop artists?  She has been doing that for some time now.  And no, the collaborations do not always work.  But guess what, she is not the first or last artist to do that and fail at it.    Now, the reason why I say that I have \\"hated\\" on Mariah Carey the last few years, I suppose, is the reason why anyone would.  She became the classic example of an artist who was not living up to her full potential.  That does not necessarily mean that an artist has to top herself again and again.  That is an unfair demand and very difficult to do.  That pressure is probably one of the main factors that led to her \\"breakdown\\" a few years back.  Who are we to criticize and de-pedestalize an artist for attempting to change her artistic vision of herself and take her music in a new direction.  Some of the best singers, actors, visual artists and instrumentalists have done the very same thing.  They just probably did it a bit better.  I refuse to fault her for attempting to do the music that stirs her creatively and I would, were I her, give this industry a big middle finger and do what moves me most.    Quite simply, I love the album.    After a few failed attempts, and yes, they were not so good.  Mainly \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\", Mariah Carey has not necessarily made a comeback.  I would not call it that for she was never really gone.  I would make the assessment (and I am quite sure that I am right), that she has finally done the album that she wanted to do for the last 10 years.    Don't you people get it?  That is why every other track on the radio is \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Mine Again\\", and \\"Shake It Off\\".  It's because they work.  I haven't heard Mariah Carey getting this much airplay since \\"Always Be My Baby\\" and \\"My All\\", back in the mid nineties.  Those songs worked as well.  \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" marks the evolving of an artist who sounds as though she is dealing with her past and looking forward to her future.  The album is vocally daring, enormous, thrilling and often times terrifying.  It is musically and instrumentally alive, retro and completely soulful.  Even the songs that aren't so great (yes people, every artist has a few), are pretty pleasurable and tolerable. After hearing this album a few times, I went back and listened to some older recordings, that I had given up on and put into the \\"never listen to again\\" category of my collection, just to see if maybe I had missed some brilliance that was there all along.  I wasn't wrong.  The great albums like \\"Mariah Carey\\", \\"Emotions\\", \\"Music Box\\" and \\"Daydream\\", remain some of my favorites because every song is different than the one beforeit.  They are pop albums that appeal to R&B audiences as well.  The lesser in quality, where Mariah is attempting to find herself musically amid hip hop and rap genres like \\"Butterfly\\", \\"Rainbow\\", \\"Glitter\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\" are messy, confused and self-conscious, the voice and the artist disconnected from the music.  I don't know about anybody else but when my early to mid twenties were tough as well and I have never had to deal with anything remotely resembling \\"celebrity\\" and its many trappings.  My theory, which like all theories, may or may not hold water, is that Mariah and her image people really forgot who her audience is; primarily 20 to early 30 something gay men and white women.  Your average 20 something black male is not eagerly anticipating the new Mariah Carey CD to drop and if he is, it ain't because of the music.    This album could potentially change that, for, while not a perfect album, it is the closest she has come to marrying pop, soul/R&B, retro 70's grooves, and rap together.  It works.  Personally, I am just glad she is back on the radio with songs that make me want to sing out loud. It's about time.      And you \\"reviewers\\" or dare I say \\"critics\\" (yeah, right...its much easier to be foolishly and cruelly critical by virtue of putting your ridiculous insults and venom into the world, than to actually foster an appreciation and respect for art, humanity and life) who give the album one star, I have to say that I have no problem with that on a fundamental level.  You are entitled to your \\"opinions\\".  But maybe you should inform your opinions, actually listen to the album and then maybe you can formulate a cohesive argument.    And for the love of all that is holy...LEARN TO SPELL.  You make me ill.
B000002MJC|5.0|When Depeche Mode's 1993 album \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" begins with screaching vinyl scratches of its opener and first single, \\"I Feel You\\", it becomes clear that there will be no room for enjoying the silence on this record.  <br /> <br />When the album hit, dedicated fans of the group's earlier releases were shocked by the band's new harder, alternative rock sound, a far departure from the days of \\"People Are People\\". The thing is they made the mistake of misjudging the album for something that is not, and that is a standard rock record. <br /> <br />Even the band's most fierce song, \\"I Feel You\\", is layered with lots of synths, from the processed distorted blues guitar riff, to the digitally effected live drums, to the trademark Depeche Mode atmospheric synth lines. <br /> <br />But this album, much like most other Depeche releases, does not rely on a few singles, but is best heard in album form. When given a full listening, \\"Songs Of Faith and Devotion\\" (SOFAD) is arguably Depeche Mode's most challenging and powerful album. <br /> <br />From the crying gospel of \\"Condemnation\\" to the somber ballad \\"Judas\\", the album tackles faith and devotion as relating to humanity, as opposed to religiously. <br /> <br />One of the album's biggest strengths is the larger contribution from each member; Martin L. Gore's writing is more refined, Alan Wilder's arrangements are borderline perfection, and Dave Gahan's vocals are his best and most organic. He really lets loose on tracks like the bouncy rocker \\"Mercy In You\\" and the epic \\"Higher Love\\". <br /> <br />Epic is a word often used (especially in this review) to describe this album, and it is because the sounds are so powerful that this might even be thought of as a sonic concept album, as the mood and pacing are so well synched. <br /> <br />The Martin L. Gore sung \\"Judas\\" progresses into the large build up of \\"In Your Room\\", which is widely believed to be one of the band's best tracks. All those doubting the band's change in image can look right to that track, all the band's trademarks --- swirling synths, fierce beats, and Gahan's emotional vocals--- are all here. <br /> <br />The band's production also shows an improvement on that of \\"Violator\\" by Flood with songs like the hip-hop flavored \\"Get Right With Me\\" and the rave pace of \\"Rush\\". <br /> <br />Sure, the band show some modern influences (Nine Inch Nails, Grunge rock), but this album is not at all a sell out (which some argue due to its #1 charting). This album is all Depeche Mode, all emotion, and you could not call yourself a fan of the band without owning it.  <br /> <br />For those of you that love rock, pop, synth, or all combined, you can find it here, in one of the most inspiring albums of the 90's.
B00005O3VC|5.0|A few months ago, I wrote a negative review for \\"Monty Python and The Holy Grail\\" that no one seemed to like. Well, today in school, we watched it in music class (didn't really understand the connection, unless it had something to do with \\"Spamalot\\"), and my opinion has now changed.<br /><br />I still have yet to watch the whole thing, but watching the film for the second time, I have now realized I was blind. I know understand a lot of the humor in it. This film is indeed screamingly funny. The opening credits? Hilarious! The coconuts? Inspired! The witch burning? Amazing! The Black Night? Classic! The Nights Who Say Ni? Great! This film may not be the funniest movie ever, but it's pretty close. It's in the Top 10.<br /><br />The extras add to a very funny movie. The commentary is funny, and the other extras are very enlightening. This is a film that I would recommend to only fans of certain humour, no \\"Saturday Night Live\\" or \\"South Park\\" humor. Still, this is a very funny movie.

020161622X|5.0|This book is easily the best book on programming that I know. Tuck it under your pillow at night, and keep it close by at all times - I recommend re-reading it every year or so because it contains so much information.  <br />The best part is that all the advice in this book _works_, sometimes spectacularly so. After reading it, I wanted to put it to practice so I implemented a fairly large system following each and every bit of advice. It was a resounding success: I ended up with a product that had almost no bugs. Even better, the bugs that were found by the rigorous QA process were all easy to fix, benign bugs.  <br />This book will make you a better programmer, and I would recommend it first and foremost, before reading any other books on design patterns and whatnot. Pragmatism rules!
B0009YA37W|5.0|Agree with the others above that this is a fantastic debut.  Happened across it in a Glasgow record shop - they were playing it and I instantly liked it.  Certainly tinges of Interpol, even more so of the bands I grew up with like Echo and Big Country.  Excellent song writing and a sweet blend of influences to achieve a unique sound.  I too feel that this album ranks with Bloc Party as the debut of the year.  With more listens, The Back Room is seeming even better due to more intellegent song writing.  Worth the import price!
0060555661|5.0|Graham's theories and analysis are timeless.  It amazed me that the book was applicable to today's market situation, although he wrote this decades ago.  The market goes through its up and downs but investor psychology doesn't change.  People still get over-emotional with their investments and have the unrealistic opinion that they can beat the market. <br /> <br />I am a follower of behavioral economics.  Graham's examples are a case study in behavior economics and the bad decisions that investors make on a daily basis.  We buy high and sell low; follow the crowd; and have unrealistic expectations of our abilities. <br /> <br />After reading the book a few years ago I changed my investment philosophy.  I have a core holding of index funds, a portion of individually managed mutual funds with superior long-term records and keep significant cash around for buying opportunities (when there is \\"blood in the street\\" and nobody wants a particular stock or to invest in securities).  It has allowed me to cut my investment analysis and management workload by 80%, while consistently beating the market for the past six years. <br /> <br />I'm no smarter than other investors.  The simple rule to follow is \\"Buy when Mr. Market is depressed and selling stocks/bonds below market value; Sell when Mr. Market is euphoric and telling us that you 'can't lose money'.\\" <br /> <br />Everyone can learn something from this book if they are willing to admit their mediocrity in trying to beat the market and have the fortitude to follow through with Graham's advice.

0316172324|4.0|Gladwell has a nice writing style and has created a simple analysis.  Many of the examples and theories resonate with me -- you usually make an initial/gut decision that is correct but you overanalyze it with the desire for more information.  I can apply his theory to my life.  I've started to make quick decisions and not dug into deeper analysis tools.  It has also been beneficial in creating peacefulness when making decisions, taking tests or being involved in stressful situations.  My results have improved and I've created a sense of peace with my decisions. <br /> <br />The book is simple and short.  I read it over a few days but would not consider this a \\"keeper\\" to put on my bookshelf.  I borrowed it from the library and promptly returned it after completion.  It would be a good $10 softback purchase but not worth the hardback price.

1400032717|5.0|What a great novel.  Clever, innovative and captivating.<br /><br />The story is told by an autistic boy, Christopher.  From page one, Christopher's story is a book about his investigation of his next door neighbor's murdered dog, Wellington.  By the way, Christopher only likes prime numbers - so, he numbers every chapter of his book only a prime number.<br /><br />Christopher is on a mission to find out who killed the pup.  As he goes about the task of journalizing his investigative findings, along the way we learn all about Christopher and his dysfunctional mother and father.  We also have plenty of diagrams drawn by Christopher; he uses diagrams to get his point across. There is a pretty big twist three-fourths of the way through the book that keeps the novel moving quickly.<br /><br />This book was thoroughly enjoyable!  I would never have thought such a heavy topic could be turned into such a creative, funny and endearing piece of art.<br /><br />The book is a quick read, and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.
B0002858YS|2.0|The Killers are another one of these retro-revivalists who've made it big. They're here honing in on those who've always had a soft spot for new wave hits. Who have enjoyed The Cure and Depeche Mode, who like their songs a little darker but still upbeat. Are they any good? Not exactly but they do show signs of promise. Somebody Told Me is not bad as a song as it has the androgynous tongue-twister chorus that is an update of Blur's Girls And Boys. The rest however is a little sub-standard really. Tossed off in a rush and sounding a bit like the also-rans of Britpop ten years ago. The music is nothing exciting though. As with most retro-revival acts, it treads on thin ice. It's only a matter of time before it cracks and then we'll see whether they sink or swim.

0375408266|5.0|Emotionally charged, disturbing and erotic, The Reader is a whirlwind rollercoaster ride. I did not want to like this book. It is morally ambiguous and philosophically horrific. Still, the book pulled me in. I couldn't put it down. With each page, each word, I was compelled to read on.<br /><br />The Reader is the story of a fifteen year old boy and a thirty year old woman. It is a story of secret friendship and illicit sex. It is a story of a relationship based on mutual need, even though neither the boy nor the woman understands the needs of the other.<br /><br />Later, as the boy grows older, he begins to unravel some of the secrets. He starts to see things more clearly. But he is still under her spell. He still wants to understand this woman with the mysterious past.<br /><br />In the end The Reader is a story of self confrontation as the boy, now a man, examines his part in what has gone before.<br /><br />George Steiner wrote in his own review of this book, Read this and Read it again. I couldn't agree more.
B000005H4F|5.0|It's all been said before, but I still feel that this is perhaps one of the more underrated of the classic jazz albums, much like Cannonball Adderley is the most underrated sax player in jazz history.  I'd put him up there with Trane, Bird, and Sonny Rollins.<br /><br />Miles Davis' sound is all over this session, and with the familiar combination of Miles and Cannonball, this feels very much like one of the classic Miles quintet/sextet albums.  The important difference here is that without Coltrane's titanic presence, Cannonball gets to shine even more.  The ballad \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" might be the most beautiful alto solo I've ever heard.  Also, on the up tempo cuts, the rhythm section of Art Blakey and Sam Jones swings so hard, you might strain your neck muscles to the groove.
0670033375|5.0|This book has made me think about every gallon of gas I pump into my car. Diamond's analyses of collapsed cultures are thorough and powerful. His descriptions of those cultures which realized how interdependent they are with the environments they live in are equally effective. Sometimes Diamond's dire warnings (\\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" and \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\") have seemed shrill to me but this book lays out some very telling pictures of how humans interact with their environment and each other from genocidal Rwandans (whose genocide was not entirely ethnically driven) to the peaceful and ecologically deliberate Tikopians. <br /> <br />If you use gas, live in a house made of wood, eat food which is grown in ways that deplete the environment you need to read this. If you think we need to continue to export our exploitation of the world's finite reserves of oil to third world countries and the ANWAR, you may not but you should. <br /> <br />A very engaging read.
0141301155|5.0|Charlie Bucket is poor.  He's so poor he only gets one chocolate bar a year, a combined present from his parents and grandparents.  And to make matters worse, he lives in the same town as Willy Wonka's mysterious chocolate factory.<br /><br />One day, Willy Wonka announces that he will open his factory to five lucky kids.  Each winner is more obnoxious and spoiled then the one before.  Is there any hope that Charlie will get to go?  And if he does, what wonders await him inside?<br /><br />Ok, so the title gives away any suspense the first part might have over whether he will get a ticket or not.  But the book is wonderful fun.  I read it a couple times as a kid and after watching the recent movie was inspired to pick it up again.  I had forgotten how many puns there are and laughed at many of them.  The story is rather straight forward but it is told with such creative rooms you can't help but read on to see where everyone goes next and what happens to them when they get there.  I want my own glass elevator.  And some of that candy sounds wonderful as well.<br /><br />Roald Dahl let his imagination soar when writing this book.  The result is a fun tale sure to entertain kids of all ages.

0124297854|5.0|Other books on this subject often are equal and contain the same amount of information : a very short mecanism and a list of 5-6 references. That's all, so you have to search the references in order to have more information.  <br />This book works completely differently : there is an \\"historical introduction\\" - often very instructive because the discovery was unintended - then a complete mechanism and a illustration of the reaction as a key step in a recent synthesis. This last point is very valuable because it shows all the importance of the concerned reaction. Finally the references are classified between articles, reviews, books, ... So it's very useful to find quickly the best reference ...  <br /> <br />In a word it's really an excellent book and it's worth the money!
B0009IW9DE|5.0|The remastering of THE LONESOME JUBILEE simply adds depth and definition to the folksy instrumentation and cautionary, almost Biblical, admonitions contained on this CD. There are also bonus cuts added as well to increase your listening pleasure. The album's lyrics about appreciating and holding on to what you have have inspired me to look at pictures of pretty actresses as a deterrent to self-indulgent behavior. The fact that Mellencamp feels that the young Australian tourist convicted in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges is innocent only adds weight to the multi-layered lyrical messages of such songs as \\"Paper In Fire\\", \\"Down And Out In Paradise\\", \\"Check It Out\\", \\"We Are The People\\", \\"Hard Times For An Honest Man\\", and many others. This album is a must for any serious Mellencamp fan.

The audio is great and the video is clear and colourful. The selection options are impressive and exciting, which include music videos that I have never seen! I love seeing Phil in his last concert tour (one of which I could not see in person), so this is a very emotional concert to watch. I love how he speaks to the audience in French, which shows he makes an effort to make the audience before him feel right at home! OK, enough about Phil, tears are beginning to fall!

B00018D3JQ|3.0|Take classic post-punk songs, by bands like Joy Division, the Clash, the Cure, and the Dead Kennedys which. Now give them a new sound: bossa nova.<br /><br />That's the particular gimmick of Nouvelle Vague, whose self-titled debut is an ironic little curiosity. And while it has pretty, tongue-in-cheek covers like a sultry \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart,\\" it never really rises above the status of \\"ironic little curiosity.\\"<br /><br />It opens with the legendary Joy Division song, done to a trippy bossa nova sound, and backed by lifeguard whistles and waves crashing. Then it dips into a chipper cover of Depeche Mode's \\"Just Can't Get Enough,\\" a rather plodding acoustic cover of the Clash's \\"Guns of Brixton,\\" and a mildly engaging version of the Undertones' \\"Teenage Kicks.\\"<br /><br />There are sultrier numbers as well -- the Cure get a cover with sultry night noises and slow guitar in \\"A Forrest,\\" and \\"Sisters of Mercy\\" is practically transcendental. But while I love the Dead Kennedys' \\"Too Drunk to F*ck,\\" it doesn't translate well to an awkward bossa nova rhythm. It doesn't fit in, and is distractingly disjointed even when taken by itself.<br /><br />Is \\"Nouvelle Vague\\" a pretty bossa nova covers album? Oh yes. Will it actually be listened to again? Hard to say. It's an interesting listen, but a novelty rather than an album in its own right.<br /><br />Certainly Nouvelle Vague has excellent choice in retro rock music, since they chose several excellent groups to cover here, and often their best songs as well. Some are catchy, some are cutely sugary, some are ethereal ballads. They're pretty to listen to, but somehow the individual flavour of each song gets lost in the downtempo sound.<br /><br />Whatever you think of the music, it can't be denied that Camille Dalmais has an exceptional voice. Except for that painful screech in \\"Too Drunk To F*ck,\\" she veers between the breathiness of Hope Sandoval to the sultry croon of Beth Gibbons. With a hint of Bjork as well, to be honest.<br /><br />In or out of Nouvelle Vague, Dalmais has enormous talent, while the rest of the album is merely \\"okay\\" or even \\"just good.\\" Diverting, but not the sort of thing to listen to over and over.Bjork as well, to be honest.  <br />  <br />In or out of Nouvelle Vague, Dalmais has enormous talent, while the rest of the album is merely \\"okay\\" or even \\"just good.\\" Diverting, but not the sort of thing to listen to over and over.

B00005J6RE|4.0|These two episodes share the theme of great genius gone wrong.  In \\"Computer\\", Kirk struggles to free the Enterprise from the grip of a computer that's become self-aware.  \\"Omega\\" had Kirk and crew trapped on a primitive planet whose history is being altered by another starship captain.  Though \\"Omega\\" is probably more ridiculed (especially for its ending) it's actually a great episode, and the clear winner of the two. <br /> <br />Not to say that \\"Ultimate Computer\\" is a bad ep - far from it.  When the \\"Enterprise\\" has Dr. Daystrom's M-5 computer installed so that it can take part in a series of wargames (uh oh!!), the ship also gets Daystrom himself.  Ufortunately, the machine gets too big to take orders from the crew, and not only goes into business for itself, but soon crosses the line between wargames and pure war.  You just can't say enough about actor William Marshal's booming voice.  You'd think that a man who finds it easier to connect with machines than mankind would sound more like Wally Cox - making Marshall's role here one of creative mis-casting.  \\"Ultimate\\" is also in search of a coherent theme.  Until the machine loses its cybernetic mind, \\"Computer\\" is a great story about men at risk of being made obsolescent by machines.  And then it goes wrong - and the computer decides that it's human and proceeds to make a great case for it by losing its mind.  While \\"The Next Generation\\" blurred the line between AI and human intelligence, this episode just assumes that machines consider themselves human and therefore free to act utterly illogically.  The promising plot arc, in which the imperfect minds of Captain Kirk & Crew manage to out-think the master brain, is lost.  Instead of a great discussion about the ironic virtues of man's imperfect mind, we get some morality play about its supremacy.  This is old hat for Trek, which confronted our heroes with a host of thinking machines that also proved susceptible to being talked out of their existence by imperfect men (Nomad, Landru & V'Ger come to mind).  This was the episode that introduced (to Trek, anyway) the term \\"Dunsel\\". <br /> <br />\\"Omega Glory\\" takes lumps for its ridiculous looking ending, but it's still a great ep - a great variation on the theme of alien societies that model themselves on shreds of our own.  Discovering a derelict starship in orbit of an unexplored planet, Kirk finds its crew wiped out by a mysterious plague - their bodies dissolved into dry crystals.  Realizing that they're infected, Kirk & Crew follow the recorded warnings of the now dead crew of the other ship - beam down to the planet's surface.  There, they find two warring civilizations - Kohms and Yangs.  The first is peaceful, and seems to take its orders from Ron Tracy, the captain of the stricken ship.  The Yangs are savage - the bad guys.  Unfortunately, Tracey has more than the safety of the Kohms to think about.  The immunity of the planet seems to have turned its inhabitants into immortal supermen.  Has Tracy discovered the \\"Fountain of Youth?\\"  And will he have to violate the \\"Prime Directive\\" to learn its secret?  This was a great ep. that works off its great casting - veteran TV actor Morgan Woodward chews up the script as Tracy, making you wonder how Trek would have looked had it been a show about his adventures.  The ending, in which Kirk rhapsodizes about the virtues of knowing freedom, is pure corn, but Tracy's character keeps the story humming with his fire and brimstone delivery.  (As an alternate-Earth society story, like \\"Patterns of Force\\" or \\"Bread & Circuses\\", \\"Glory\\" is unique in that it saves that revelation for the end.) <br /> <br />Trivia: In \\"Glory\\", Ron Tracy thinks he's found the fountain of youth.  In the \\"Logan's Run\\" TV show, Woodward played an \\"Elder\\" - one of the select few men who were allowed to live past their 30th birthday, even if secretly.

After the great Lovedrive, the guitaring and dare i say it the wquality of songs take a bit of a nosedive on Animal Magnetism, but from here on in, Matthias and the rest of the Scorpions embark on a musical pinnacle. Blackout, Love at First Sting, Savage amusement, Crazy world, Face the heat and Pure instinct. <br /> <br />Ok on to the tracks: <br /> <br />Well the title track opener is a standard Scorpions classic now (if you don't know it - where have you been ?)  <br />Can't live without you  - i personally love the \\"Worldwide Live\\" version of this track - this is clearly an audience song and the audience participation comes over! <br />Track 3 You give me all I need - I like this song a lot, the rhythm guitar line makes this song bounce along nicely - yup, even hard rock songs can do this too. \\"Now\\" - what a thrash ! Love it ! Dynamite - some naughty lyrics, but a very strong song. <br />Arizona - inspired by the Scorpions'previous US tour is another bouncy solid rhythmed song. China White is a hard rock song with a hard theme. Finally, When the smoke is going down a classic Scorpions ballad, of which at least one is present on each album. <br /> <br />If you buy this and like it, you will certainly like the five that follow.  <br />  <br />
B000000WFZ|4.0|I gave this cd 4 stars just because I adore Gabriel's Oboe; it's the reason I bought the cd, as we used it for our wedding processional. But past the Ave Maria, I can't really enjoy listening to it; a little too dark and dischordant to hear without the accompanying film.

B00005ATQD|4.0|This film is excellent.  for the people who think that this movie is primarily about sex; not true.  you all must be overlooking the bigger picture about marriage, commitment, and betrial.  the photography and direction of this film is excellent, and the timing is perfect.   yes, it is a slow moving film, but it is perfect like that.  if this film was fast paced, it would be wierd and akward, but its slow so you can soak everything up.  most movies have huge action scenes in very little time, and then your always like \\"so wait, what happened?\\"  and its not because the film is complex and intelligent, but because you moved so fast you dont know what happened.  so i rather like slower paced movies.  this film is not best picture, but it deserves FAR more recognition than it has recieved. <br /> <br />an excellent film.
B000002URV|5.0|No matter how many times I listen to this album, I never grow tired of it. As a matter of fact, I literally think that I could listen to this all hours of the day for the rest of my life, and be perfectly content! Very rarely, an album this good comes along, but when it does, it is cherished forever. <br /> <br />It is just... pure ambience. The album's style could best be summed-up as \\"electro-verve with a touch of chanson and philosophical excerpts.\\" Songs like 'Callous Went Away' and 'The Rivers of Belief' provide such a relaxing ambience of eletronic-intrumental harmony... I could get lost in them forever.

B00003CXTG|1.0|A tragic US event in Hawaii made into an almost joke.  The fight scene may have been good, but the stretching of the truth for dramatic effect was painful.  \\"I can't swim\\" when said from any Navy soldier was beyond stupid and unrealistic when one of te ships were being sunk.  Yes, pilots may have gotten in illegally, its possible.  But in my mind it is a MAJOR screw up from the screenwriter and director Michael Bay for allowing such inaccurate battle scenes to be filmed.  *SPOILER*  You cant tell me you can shoot up a plane from a tower with a pistol and shot gun.  maybe a heavy duty machine gun, but that is pushing it.  the love story got over the top too. <br /> <br />very poor overall.
0312323859|5.0|When I read this book, I was filled with so many different emotions...Maybe it's because Darcy reminded me somewhat of me and my best friend back in the days. Then we grew up and experienced life. Darcy definitely possesses an unforgetable character. This book will make you laugh and cry.  I recommeded this to all my friends and they all loved it.  I can't wait for a third book!
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is getting so much review time, but people either don't like the music or are misenterpreting the concept of American Idiot.  Overall I feel this CD is amazing.  Like any CD, it has its weak points (who's to say what a weak point anyway?  Forany point could be considered a weka point when you compare it to another part of the album), btu overall it is a very well put-together album. <br /> <br />American Idiot tells of protagonist Jesus of Suburbia (American Idiot), who lives in a small town in a broken home on East 12th Street (Jesus of Suburbia).  I saw in another review somewhere that the town he lives in is called Jingletown, but I haven't attempted to confirm it.  Feeling held back and cramped in his current state of mind, he decides to leave home in search of something new.  He observes the reality of the world that he has never experienced (Holiday).  He soon realizes that he doesn't belong in the big city because he is getting pushed around and he 'walks alone' (Boulevard of Broken Dreams).  Ralizing his state of mind(We Are the Waiting), Jesus then decides to radically change his personality, and in doing so, becomes the rebellious St. Jimmy (St. Jimmy).  Jimmy experiments with drugs (Give Me Novocaine) and then meets a girl named Whatsername (She's a Rebel, Extraordinary Girl).  They being to see each other and over little time, he falls in love.  Although St. Jimmy comes off as a \\"wild drugged rebel\\", if you will, at heart, he is still Jesus of Suburbia at heart.  Whatsername is a true rebel and sees the kindhearted Jesus inside of Jimmy.  She soon and then breaks up with Jimmy.  Jimmy then expresses his heartbreak to himself through depression (Letterbomb, Wake Me Up When September Ends).  He then decides through his inner judge, to shed his skin of St. Jimmy and return to his inner self.  He \\"murders\\" St. Jimmy, and returns to Jesus of Suburbia.  He quickly decides to return home and return to his old life (Homecoming).  The album finishes off of him learnign about the nautre of human rebelleion and suffering of the human condition, as he wonders what happened of Whatsername. <br /> <br />Excuse me, for this is how I MYSELF interpreted the album's message, I believe I am accurate.  It's up to you to interpret the album's concept.  Many believe the album to be about Armstrong's life, and many believe it to be an anti-war/Bush story.  This is how I and a select few interpret it.  I'm sure alot of people are sitting there reading my review thinkgin my view is totally warped, btu it's how i read the album, and thast the beauty of any concept album, is that you can concive it any way you like. <br /> <br />All in all, American Idiot is outstanding, track-for-track. <br /> <br />American Idiot:  A very catchy, fun track, very underrated, btu overplayed.  Then again, you can;t hold it against a band for overplaying there songs, its all about how much you pay attention to the media.  9/10 <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia:  as a whole, this songs is incredible.  the ryhtm changes are beautiful, and everyhting is harmonically in-place, particularly on pt. II, \\"City of the Damned\\".  The key ot enjoying this track is to know when the tempos change, when the songs change within the track and to think of it has changing track, instead of thinking of the band simply changing key/time sigantures completely.  Highlight- City of the Damned.  10/10 <br /> <br />Holiday:  this song is an ecellently written song, i love the catchy beginning, and the harmonization of voices during the chorus (\\"from the hollow lies\\"/\\"of the rest of our lives\\").  9/10 <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams:  personally, if this song were done all acoustically with no distortions, it would be ten times better.  Overall, still a very good song though.  Probably the worst song on the album, yet is still very good.  7/10 <br /> <br />We Are the Waiting:  this song is incredible.  sounds better when played chords instead of the arpeggios like Armstrong does on the track, this song has beautiful lyrics regarding a drastic change in ones personality.  9/10 <br /> <br />St. Jimmy:  the most energetic song on the CD.  Very fast, heavy, and punk rock-inpired, this is my first or second favorite song on the CD.  10/10 <br /> <br />Give Me Novocaine:  very good song that i didnt start to like until after owning the album for awhile but its a very good effort.  the acousitc guitar sounds a bit Hawaiin, until the heavy power-chord verse comes in ringing.  8/10 <br /> <br />She's a Rebel: one of the msot underrated songs on the album, this song reminds me of somethign off of an older greenday album.  doesnt relaly stand out but very good.  8/10 <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl: I feel this song is average, except fr the part in the chorus at the beginning, \\"shes all aone again/wiping the tears from her eyes\\"... unknown to me why, i think that small part is unbelievable.  low point of the cd though.  5/10 <br /> <br />Letterbomb:  this song has an odd structure of verse-chorus, bridge, verse-chorus, but it is an EXCELLENT song, particularly the chorus, very very catchy.  underrated by many.  9/10 <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends:  as far as i know, by an interview with billie joe armstrong in a magazine, he states that this song is the only song that goes out of the overall plot of the concept, and is about his past realtionship with a loved one and his father dying 7-20 years before.  probably my favorite song on the album.  10/10 <br /> <br />Homecoming:  much like Jesus of Suburbia, this song is split into 5 parts or so.  as before, imagine the song split into tracks to make the song more desirable.  this song is agood but lacks the power that the previous 9-minute song holds.  7/10 <br /> <br />Whatsername:  sorry boys, but I honestly hate this song, it lacks all originality, there is barely any guitar, and sounds as if it has a drumbeat from a keyboard.  hey every album has to have a low point, unfortunately, greenday decided to end on theirs.  3/10 <br /> <br />overall, though, this album is unbelievable. rememebr that i compare the songs to all the songs that i like, not just to green day's standards.  3/10 is better than it sounds, when compared to all the songs ever made. this album holds a beautiful moral, and tells us about the true nature of rebellion.  every band srives for ambition, and to make a good concept album is beyong amazing for any band.  Every band wants to make \\"The Wall\\", btu very few bands-- like Green Day-- can actually do it. <br /> <br />keep rocking, everyone. <br />Jon
B000068FUS|4.0|As this is only my second DBT cd purchase, I'm no authority on the band.  It seems to me, though, that there are some tracks on here that I absolutely LOVE.  Like the first four tracks on disc one, \\"Plastic Flowers on the Highway,\\" \\"Let the be Rock,\\" and most of all \\"Life in the Factory.\\"  That being said, the other ones have failed to really touch me or even create memories in over a year of owning the cd.  So four stars because the tracks I mentioned are stand-out hardass.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|I personally think this is the best of all the \\"dead\\" films from Romero.  \\"Night\\" was great, but it just doesnt beat \\"dawn\\" to me.  I own this edition myself, and expect quite a bit out of DVDs.  This edition is awesome.  3 versions of the film with 3 commentaries.  worth every cent.  the movie itself is great. the commercial industry commentary was great.  this movie is scary, and has great suspense even though it is slow moving.  i recommend this edition even if you own the edition previously released.  the \\"ultimate edition\\" cannot be beat.
0141301155|5.0|When I was in 3rd grade I remember Mrs. Duckett, one of the volunteers, settling into a chair and reading this book to my class. The rest, as they say, is history. I was enthralled by the story, and I loved to listen to her read a couple of chapters a day. The whole class would drop down around this woman's feet and go dead silent.  <br /> <br />That was my first real experience with a book. It's led to a love that's with me today. Don't just read this book, BUY it. Share it with your children. And forget the movies they've made about it, because they just don't get it. Charlie's adventures are best lived in the hearts and minds of adults and children who believe in the magic of imagination and whimsy. It changed my life forever, and opened to a wonderful world where anything is possible.
B0000046KM|5.0|The first cut I ever heard from Shirley Horn was \\"You Won't Forget Me\\", and I've been in love with her ever since.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This film is a rare bird indeed, worthy of all the hype. Fantastic fight scenes and legitimately funny moments are combined in this film to create an incredibly entertaining film. The \\"hair fire\\" scene alone is worth the price of the DVD.  <br /> <br /> There are alot of bad films out there, Kung Fu Hustle is not one of them.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|The Machinist is, above all, a true testament to how far a serious actor will take his profession. Christian Bale wholeheartedly dove into his role, playing a skeletal figure who is suffering insomnia and psychological problems. <br />The Machinist is a very psychological thriller, somewhere between Memento and Fight Club. Dramatic at times, disturbing at others, The Machinist, directed by Brad Anderson, is involving and dark.  <br />The acting is superb, not only by Bale, the direction is solid and the story, although easy to figure out, is fairly original. <br />Definitly worth watching, mabye not worth buying, unless you're a fan of Bale's.  <br />The special features include the ever popular movie trailor's and making of documentary. They also include a great commentary for anyone wanting to find out everything about the movie. <br />Finally, there are deleted scenes. The scenes aren't so much deleted, as just extended or alternate cuts of scenes that already exist in the movie. Ultimately not very engaging. <br /> <br />Movie: 4 stars <br />Features: 2 stars
B00014TJ6Q|3.0|George's contribution to the Beatles is underrated, in my opinion. His solo output is inconsistent, however.  I remember liking this album when it came out, so I picked up the cd recently at a used record store. <br /> <br />It's not as good as I remembered.  The best tracks are \\"Not Guilty\\" (though a superior version can be found on Anthology 3), \\"Your Love Is Forever\\", and \\"Love Comes To Everyone\\".   <br /> <br />George's guitar playing is excellent throughout. Unfortunately, much of this album is marred by George's weak vocals. \\"Faster\\" and \\"Soft-Hearted Hana\\" are the most blatant examples of this. At this point in his career, his voice was best suited for mellow pieces such as the three mentioned above, and \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\". <br /> <br />\\"Blow Away\\" was a minor hit, I believe, and its' instrumentation is appealing, with distinctive guitar work from Harrison.  The song is upbeat, as is much of the album.  It also contains the lyric \\"all its got to take is some warmth to make it\\" -- blecch! <br /> <br />\\"George Harrison\\" is a decent effort from, well, George Harrison.  He sounds happy and mellow on this album, which is pleasing.  For non-\\"All Things Must Pass\\" fare, I advise you to pick up \\"Living In The Material World\\" or \\"Extra Texture\\" before this one.  But you could do worse than this cd.
B000001ESF|5.0|THIS IS THE FULLY DEVELOPED RUSH OF THEIR 'EARLY PERIOD'...AND I CONSIDER THIS CLASSIC OF AN EXCITING ALBUM 'EARLY RUSH' ALONG THE LINES OF CARRESS OF STEAL AND FLY BY NIGHT...THE BIG CHANGES WOULD COME WITH KINGS AND HEMISPHERES A LITTLE LATER ON WHERE ALEX'S GUITAR WOULD START SINGING IT'S OWN LITTLE CATCHY SONG PARTS WITHIN SONGS...THIS RUSH ALBUM HERE IS MEAN, FIERCE CAPTAIN BEYOND-LIKE PROG THAT EXPLODES WITH PASSION AND ANGER...LIKE ALL RUSH IT IS LOADED WITH AMBIANCE AND BRADY BUNCH LIKE MELODIES BUT PACKAGED TO EXPLODE LIKE A NUCLEAR BOMB...GEDDY AND NEIL ROCK OUT COMPLICATED BUT ALEX IS MORE THAN HANGING ON FOR THE RIDE...THE SONGS DO GET MELLOW AFTER A WHILE BUT THATS OK...RUSH WERE 'FINDING THEIR WAY'....A FIVE STAR CLASSIC EPIC !

B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This is a great CD.  In many ways it sounds like it could have been made in the early to mid 70s but it's updated.  There's enough burried in the detail of the songs to keep it interesting.  The guitar sounds are great. Vocals too. Great haunting melodies, great overall sound and the oddest thing is that they somehow make it all catchy.  Even my sister likes it. Virtually no filler. Each song seems better than the last.
B000059LGC|5.0|If you can accept this adaptation of Agatha Christie's \\"Death on the Nile\\" in the spirit it was intended, you'll have a good time. Faithful followers of her great books may find a lot of little details to nit-pick over but as a fun murder mystery this one is truly grand.<br /><br />The production is visually pleasing and the star-studded cast are all fun to watch. At its center is Peter Ustinov's fine portrayel of Christie's greatest creation, Hercule Poirot. His interpretation of the Belgian detective with the little grey cells is both smart and humorous. The film is great fun for murder mystery fans.<br /><br />On vacation in Egypt, Poirot overhears one conversation after another about the rich and selfish Lynette. It seems almost everyone has a reason for wanting her dead. Among Lynette's many trophies is her best friend's boyfriend. She is suing a sexpot writer for slander, is on the verge of finding out her attorney is swindling her, and is keeping her servant girl from happiness with another. Poirot knows this trip to Egypt will be no vacation when Mia Farrow, the jilted lover of Lynette's husband, tells him: \\"If love can't live in your heart, evil will do just as well.\\"<br /><br />The period production is sumptuous in its presentation of both Egypt and their excursion by boat down the beautiful Nile River. It is resplendent and elegant fun and the cast is allowed to play it out with gusto. Ustinov gives Poirot a droll humor even after a close brush with a cobra, planted in his cabin by the murderer.<br /><br />Angela Lansbury and Betty Davis both ham it up in appropriate fashion and Lois Chiles is good as the not so deep Lynette. Jack Warden, George Kennedy, Maggie Smith, Olivia Hussey, and John Finch join David Niven, as Poirot's old pal, in a great ensemble cast of movie legends.<br /><br />If you have a couple of hours to kill and want an old-fashioned and entertaining murder mystery to pass the time with, this one will definitely do the trick. This trip down the Nile is a lot of fun.own the Nile is a lot of fun.

B0000019PA|3.0|I Would love to give this album a straight 5 stars. I cant. Its too good. and its not good enough. I love it. I hate it. I would be glad to give no stars, because of where it takes you. you cant judge this album from a musical standpoint... though the music is very good, and at times, sublime. You cant judge this album from a lyrical standpoint; they just arent accessable enough for most, and probably too convoluted to be courteous of even the deepest ponderer. how can you judge it? from where it puts you. No, I dont really think jeff magnum is some sort of genious... He has an interesting way of leaving his lyrics one step lower in concious refinment: he dosent decode his dreams for you like most other songwriters will as a polite service. they are verbally beautiful, and well written, but encoded. very astheticly pleasing at first, chilling once the meanings reveal themselves. what can I actually say about ths album? I will give a isten by listen description of what I thought of this album. <br />1st listen: good music, interesting sonic textures, fascinating singing style, entertaining imagrey. I love it. <br /> <br />2nd listen: a lot like the first, some images start to get clearer, notice the great instrumental track. <br /> <br />3rd listen: lyrics start to be understood, interesting concepts. <br /> <br />4th listen: many of the dark meanings, critical and cynical views of niaeve love, and life come through. lyrics quite clear now. some inspiring, some  <br /> <br />After a while, the good music is overbalanced with disillusionment, and the clarity of the lyrics brings me down. Could I be like the 2 headed (faced) boy really running on a crude and predictible system of pulleys and weights? pursuing shallow goals, soon to be gone or left alone forever? nah... but thinking through the violet filter of this album can make it seem that way.  <br /> <br />The lyrics really are dreamlike, and unless you want to write god a letter and ask him what crazy thoughts heput in this guy's head, theres no way to be positive of a meaning... but what I get from it is pretty much an accusition of shallow relationships, and a cynical view on the carpe diem attitude. there is a brief view of meaning in \\"ghost\\". but it is short lived, and possibly sarcastic, or hopeful... I cant figure this one out for sure. tack 10 implies hope in track 9. I dont know... <br />listen to it. <br />dont let it bring you down. <br />try to get it to bring you up.
0671027344|4.0|Easy read. At first I had a problem with the writing but quickly kept myself by remembering it's supposed to be written by a fourteen/fifteen year old. With that in mind I could handle it. I also noticed his skills in writing evolve and get better. The characters are extremely likeable and and I felt they were all easy to connect with as I've been in similair situations that many of them were in. My only major beef with this book was the ending as i felt Chbosky was running out of steam and couldn't think of decent way to tie loose ends up and finish the book. I felt ripped off and I felt that it's was highly unbelievable. If it wasn't for the rest of the book, I would have diregarded it, but I feel this is a book that can be re-read (minus the last couple of letters) and still keep it's charm. <br /> <br />The mix-tape he makes is very good too and I tend to listen to it on late night drives home. If you can get a copy of it, do so.
B000002UAU|5.0|Clearly this album represents one of the finer moments in rock history. The Beatles are a group that represents the diversity of music, with their stylistic variance from one song to another and use of different influences and musical instruments, particularly in this album. As George Emerick, the recording engineer on the album stated in the included booklet, \\"The Beatles insisted that everything on Sgt. Pepper had to be different,\\" and that statement is evident throughout this musical experience. In no circumstances will the listener be bored.<br /><br />As the first conceptual art album ever, this classic CD opens with \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,\\" introducing the image of a live concert being played to an audience with the fictitious lead singer Billy Shears. The first guitar riffs open the album on what can only be described as a rockin' note. With Paul McCartney's songs dominating on this thirteen-track disc, there are a few samples of the more up-beat love songs such as \\"When I'm 64\\" or \\"Lovely Rita.\\" These ballads contain cute lyrics but have evolved much from the days of \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\" In contrast, \\"Within You Without You\\" is a superb taste of the Indian influence, with its smooth Sitar chords and hypnotic lyrics. George Martin's lyrics also offer a more philosophical take than other songs on this album. The melodic notes of the chord create an ambiance on \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" but the beat is picked up a bit with the provocative \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" Classics like, \\"With a Little Help From my Friends\\" and \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" satisfy the need for the familiar yet entertaining. \\"A Day in the Life\\" ends this brilliant collection, which is one of the better known and more revered hits, for good reason. The sound effects and use of electronic distortion, mixing, and recreation differentiate this album from any of its time.<br /><br />Owning this album for the reasons of listening to the music is obvious, but it is strongly recommended that the owner investigate the cover art, booklet, and history that provide a base for this piece of art. The intriguing cover is explained in the booklet by the designer Peter Blake. You will also find a map, similar to those in boxes of chocolates, that gives the name and profession of each audience member chosen by the Fab Four (aka Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band).  You will also learn of the original intention for the track order, as well as the original packaging of the LP. Unfortunately the tracks \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" \\"It's Only a Northern Song \\"and\\" Penny Lane\\" were left off this already genius album despite being recorded for Sgt. Pepper's. The lack of these great tracks, though, leaves anticipation for Magical Mystery Tour.<br /><br />According to Wikipedia.com, \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" not only won the 1967 Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Album Cover, Best Engineered Recording, and Contemporary Album, but was recently named the Number One Greatest Album of All Time in a `Music of the Millennium' poll.  Whereas \\"Rubber Soul\\" was the group's first venture into depth of music, this album expresses their fine-tuning of their evolution as a rock band. Also noted on Wikipedia.com are the seemingly unconnected songs throughout the album, as John Lennon was not interested in adhering to the so-called theme. What is revealed, though, is that they all do share a common underlying bond of being divergent from \\"normal\\" music- with the electronic additions and unusual instruments.<br /><br />This album represents a celebrated rebellion to music of its time, and is additionally one that can be listened to over and over with growing enthusiasm.but it is strongly recommended that the owner investigate the cover art, booklet, and history that provide a base for this piece of art.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|I first heard Gavin Degraw \\"I don't want to be\\" on One Tree Hill and could not believe what a good singer he was. I immediatly went and bought his cd. Both the regular and the stripped version are really good. I listen to this cd almost every day  because it is so relaxing. So far my favorite songs on this cd is \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Nice to meet you anyway\\". \\"Belief\\" is also an awesome song. I am so glad I found out about Gavin Degraw and look forward to hearing more of his songs in the future.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Step 1)  Try to make a Beatles album, any originality in thought needs to immediately be terminated    Step 2)  Fail miserably at making an album that sounds like a Beatles album (the fact is any member of the Beatles was a better songwriter than the combined members of Oasis)    Step 3)  Release the annoying first single that tries to sound like a Beatles song    Step 4) Tell everyone you're better than the Beatles    Step 5) Have Radiohead release an album and make you look pathetic    Step 6) Repeat steps 1-5
0739313126|4.0|I enjoyed it very much.  Couldn't wait for the next disc.  I know it is fiction, but all said and done, it made you question your beliefs, and what you were taught.  With all that is going on with the Catholic Church today, makes you wonder if some of the fiction was actually true.
B000002JK2|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I picked it up on vinyl way back in the 70's, because I was a big Townshend fan, and replaced it recently, with the CD version.  Very enjoyable CD that rocks!
B00004T0PZ|5.0|Some reviewer said that people fled the store where they played this great record while complaining about the racket...of course they did. This is not music to play while you are shopping (even if it's shopping at a record store). This is music to be appreciated in an ambience of tranquility and peace so you can really focus and inmerse your self deep within it's complex harmonic and melodic twists and turns. Excellent and highly recommended to those who stayed in the store.
B00000099Y|5.0|Radiohead. <br /> <br /> <br />Aenima and Tool are both great though, sure you can disagree with this review, but it's fact. <br /> <br />For all you people who say Tool is the Pink Floyd of our generation, have you even heard 'Kid A' once?  I own all of Pink Floyds albums, and there is much more similarites with them and Radiohead than them and Tool.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This film is amazing.  I've never seen anything like it:  It is charming, hilarious, touching, powerful, poignant, and inspiring all at the same time.  A real treasure.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I have been an Alien fan since I was like 3 or 4 years old.  These movies are my life (I know it's sad, but it's true).  This is the best DVD box set of all time for anything.<br /><br />Disc 1 - ALIEN<br /><br />Wow, what a good movie.  Very atmospheric and scarey.  The Director's Cut is still good, but no match for the original cut.<br /><br />Disc 2 - The Beast Within: The Making of Alien<br /><br />There are so much extras on this disc that it gives me a headache.  You know that there's enough special features when you haven't looked at them all after two years.<br /><br />Disc 3 - ALIENS<br /><br />My favorite movie of all time.  Awsome characters, great storyline.  The Special Edition has some great stuff added into it, but the original will always be the greatest movie ever.<br /><br />Disc 4 - Superior Firepower: The Making of Aliens<br /><br />We couldn't ask for more extra features for this movie.  There are some excellent interviews and other things on the documentary.<br /><br />Disc 5 - Alien 3<br /><br />I love this movie, and I like the Special Edition alot.  They're both good and I don't know which one is better.  David Fincher needs to say something about this movie instead of being a wimp and ignoring it.<br /><br />Disc 6 - The Making of Alien 3<br /><br />They skimped out on some stuff for the documentary because of all the bad talk about 20th Century Fox.  There's still alot of extra things on this disc that will satisfy fans.<br /><br />Disc 7 - Alien Resurrection<br /><br />I really hate this movie, and I hate the Special Edition as well, but I can't lie that the new opening is interesting to watch.<br /><br />Disc 8 - One Step Beyond: The Making of Alien Resurrection<br /><br />I can't lie.  This disc has alot of interesting stuff on it compared to how bad the movie is.  It's a worthwhile look into the making of the movie.  At least some of the people are honest and say that they don't like it.<br /><br />Disc 9 - Alien Quadrilogy<br /><br />Wow, the laserdisc archive is worth it alone.  Bob Burns is one of the coolest guys ever.  The trailers are so sweet.  We get all the Alien comic book covers on DVD-ROM.  Awsome...<br /><br />I recommend this to any sci-fi fan or anyone who can afford this box set.  Enjoy.is worth it alone.  Bob Burns is one of the coolest guys ever.  The trailers are so sweet.

B0007GAEW6|5.0|The album is musically smokin'! some of the lyrics are laughable, but i'm willing to overlook it.
B00028HBKM|1.0|\\"That wasn't a movie, that was a Snuff film!\\"    The brutal truth couldn't have been presented in more clarity.  Watch the episode of South Park, the Passion of the Jew and you will see exactly what I mean.  Go ahead and bash me but inside you know these words to be true.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I must admit I am an avid Star Trek TNG fan. I grew up watching that show. It defined the science fiction genre for me. Since it ended very few shows have come close to competing with it. And I will agree with many of you in saying that TNG was very hokey and fake at times, but even so nothing since then has been able to compete. <br /> <br />Then came Firefly. At first I was a little skeptical of this show mainly because everyone I have talked to that watched tried to push the show on me almost as if it was an addictive drug. Finally, the other night, one of my friends convinced me to watch the first episode and I was hooked. The show was amazing, and you can hardly tell it is even a science fiction show. It is the genre a space western at its best. I watch most of the rest of the series before I went to bed (I stayed up late). <br /> <br />If you like science fiction, even if it is only a small amount, you will love this show. It is by far one of the best dramas of any kind I have seen, period. Even better this DVD is cheep. Very much worth the price considering it contains 14 episodes of some of the best television out there.
B000068FUS|4.0|Without a doubt, the most unique band out there. DBT is a collection of progressive rednecks that pay homage to the South and their favorite band, Lynyrd Sknyrd. This album is true to the title, it is a Southern Rock Opera. The story centers around a musician growing up during the golden age of rock, the 1970s. However, after the plane crash that killed Ronnie Van Zant (and Lynyrd Skynyrd), our protagonist (like much of the South) loses his music heroes and his direction. Hard to compare this group to another. They are certainly Southern rockers, but with a little punk mixed in. They are proud to be from the South, it might not be perfect, but it is home.
B000088E6D|5.0|This is a great CD.  I listen to it in the morning to get by day started right.  Micheal Buble is truly talented.
0634022296|5.0|AS a guitarist you are not going to be interested in piano scores that go on for pages and sometimes in the wrong keys. You are interested in looking at one page with the chords over the lyrics. That's exactly what you need in most cases. That is also exactly what this does for you. This book is excellent for any level.  <br /> <br />The only exception would be songs like blackbird, julia, norwegian wood. In those songs you may want some tab.  <br /> <br />Dominic Priolo Beverly mass. <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I read a review of this album that said, \\"Who would have expected a triumph of this magnitude from Green Day?\\" Anyone who's been paying attention for the past ten years, that's who. <br /> <br />While trends came and went, Green Day stayed the course, continuing to make their unique brand of melodic, '60s-flavored punk, constantly evolving their sound and sharpening their skills. <br /> <br />\\"American Idiot\\" is like a victory lap, a stunning album for both old fans and new to rally behind. Not a departure from the band's sound, but a distillation, an underscore, a vital summation of everything they've ever been good at. <br /> <br />Now the band that conquered the world ten years ago has justifiably done it again. Bravo.
0553208845|3.0|This book follows a spiritual journey of the lead character through four stages of life: a Brahmin's son, an aesthetic in the woods, a merchant/gambler, and finally a wise ferryman. In the end, the wisdom reached by the titular character is a hybrid of Buddhist and Hindu teachings.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book in college and have been drawn back to read it several times since. My recent mature reading was the least satisfying. The end particularly troubled me. The complete selfishness of this supposed wise man truly renders him a stunted hero.<br /><br />I noticed several morally problematic scenes that are not well answered in the novel. For example, the Ferryman tells Siddhartha that his 12 year old son can fend for himself in the forest and world. Even in the world Hesse has constructed here, Siddhartha's actions are nothing short of criminal negligence. When you step back and look at the entire book, you realize the immense selfishness of Siddhartha in relation to his friend Govinda, his parents, his mistress, his fellow merchants, and even his son.<br /><br />Siddhartha makes no real sacrifice in his quest for wisdom. He chooses his path and runs roughshod over the lives of those around him. When his son unexpectedly appears, the Ferryman tells him to let his son go (which he does) because his son will not be happy raised by two old men by the river. Never for a moment does Siddhartha consider giving up his Ferryman existence and moving back into the town to raise his son. He doesn't even really care about his son FOR his son. He spends most of the time worrying about his own bruised heart caused by the son's rejection of his \\"love.\\"<br /><br />When I was young, I completely identified with the lead character on his spiritual quest. You pursue your goals with determination and ignore the consequences. Now I see how empty a life Siddhartha created for himself. Who would find a life without friends and family rewarding? Not many.
B0009AM5JA|4.0|This album is great.  It's hard-hitting, lacks pretension when pretension could have been easily inserted, and has generally good songs.  The only reason I am giving this album four stars is because Coldplay's sophomore studio album, &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is a classic album.  It is a five-star effort, and X&amp;Y, although good, falls short of greatness in comparison to &quot;Rush of Blood&quot;.  I wouldn't recommend this album to new Coldplay fans, but rather, to die-hards who know what to expect from the band.  It's spacey, it's cool, it's another consistently good Coldplay album.
B00005JNTX|5.0|EVERYONE, STOP GIVING THE MOVIE 1 STAR BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL EDITION COMING OUT SOON. YOU'RE LOwERING THE AVERAGE SCORE.    this is a good movie :( and i wish more people would say that without giving it one star because of no special features. it's stupid.
630587493X|5.0|The movie focuses on three key components of the human being: FREEDOM, LOVE and RIGHTs. <br /> <br />A robot may have \\"his\\" own bank account? <br />May \\"he\\" purchase \\"his\\" own freedom? <br />May \\"he\\" fall in love of  a human being? <br />A Robot gives up \\"his\\" never ending life and all \\"he\\" belongs to live, love and die just like a man !!!! <br /> <br />Although it is a clean family movie, the topics covered are most definitely adult. My 7 year old son asked me, why a man should pay for getting his own freedom? <br /> <br />Indeed very touching and thought provoking movie. I loved this movie and highly recommend it. <br /> <br />
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is a rare thing in today's music.  It is an album that people will remember, 20, 50, 100 years from now as a classic album.  'Rush of Blood' has it all; catchy choruses, beautiful lyrics, awesome guitar, sad songs, happy love songs, a mix of folk, rock, new age and even punk.  It can please just about any music fan with its ecclectic nature.  Chris Martin has a soulful, gorgeous falsetto and when he rocks out and lets loose, there is nothing like it.  I would recommend 'Rush of Blood' to anyone and everyone.  It's sheer genius.
0380715430|4.0|For my best friend and me, this book became our basis of conversation for more than a year. We decided to start referring to it as \\"the Good Book.\\" This book gave me fervent enthusiasm for learning English and its history that is still strong six years later. <br /> <br />Apparently, however, several \\"facts\\" are wrong. So you should take it with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, most of the facts are correct. Besides this book is so fun to read, I still recommend it. <br /> <br />I also take issue with some of the critisisms. The comments about chauvinism are ridiculous. So what if he's a chauvinist! So you're warned he's a chauvinist. That doesn't count as a \\"factual error.\\" Nor does it dent scholarship. Those who say that Bryson is an idiot for calling \\"inuits\\" eskimos are idiots themselves. Regardless of who may consider the word \\"incorrect\\" or \\"offensive,\\" two facts remain: (1) Everyone knows what an Eskimo is, and (2) the word suits Bryson's personable writing style much better than the stuffy \\"inuit.\\" Picking at this issue is pure pedantry.
B0000026T4|1.0|\\"TRASH\\"    REVIEW:  Mired with special guest appearances and an attempt to fit into the mold of Bon Jovi-like rockers, this is Alice at his worst. The top-ten hit single, \\"Poison\\" is the only track worth mentioning while the remaining tracks are so poorly written that you can understand why the album is called \\"Trash\\". Ok, perhaps that's a bit harsh BUT this is certainly Alice at his worst.     MUSICIANS:  Far too many to list. Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, Richie Sambora, Kip Winger - to name a few.     INTERESTING FACTS:    1. The working title for \\"Trash\\" was \\"Low Class Reunion\\".     2. \\"Trash\\" was released in July of 1989 and peaked at #20. It would eventually be certified Platinum in May of 1990.    3. The single \\"Poison\\" charted at #7 and would be certified Gold. The single would mark his first US chart single in nine years!    PACKAGING:    It may be simple but \\"Trash\\" does boast a cool \\"iconic\\" photo of Alice on the cover. Lyrics are included.    APPROX. RUNNING TIME:    40 min. and 23 sec.    FINAL ANALYSIS:    \\"Trash,\\" while commercially successful, is Alice's worst album that was produced under the watchful eye of pop songwriter-for-hire Desmond Child. Avoid \\"Trash\\" at all costs! *1/2 out of 5.
B0002RQ2T4|5.0|I just have a few things to say.  First off this is not a full on action anime so don't try and compair it to movies like Ninja Scroll. Second, it was in fact listed by the creators of the matrix as a insperation for certain concepts of the film but It is more akin to Blade Runner.  Third,  the main character is not nude the entire movie, she is wearing a body suit (you can discover this for yourself if you actually pay attention to the film).  If you want to see a great anime with a pretty good story then check it out.  If you are just going to bash it because you can't understand it then do everyone a favor and rent Lion King.

0385338686|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The book pulls you in from the first page and I had a hard time putting the book down.  I became the character and I sweated through every problem she faced.  Even though it's only a funny story, it has a real meaning.  If you just walk through the fear, you can win.  I hated seeing this book end; can't wait for the next.  This author is good.
B00004RF8J|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I've always loved the music and have wanted to see the play (high school drama department just can't do it true justice).  The ending strays a bit from the play, but it was well done.  Rick Morranis is terrific and an excellent singing voice.
B000059ZT4|5.0|Having the Tuff Gong release remastered from the original master tapes and now this, I can say that the remixing adds clarity and lowers the bass boom somewhat...The wonderful Jamaican release is the key to getting this CD for lovers of Marley..the music is roots, simpler,harmonies somewhat more prominent in places,less rock effects than the the second CD with 2 tracks not released on original \\"western\\" release...no filler here...truly a totally different album in sound and atmosphere..indeed the length of both cd's is a real issue,way too short,the artwork and lyrics are nice  but again it is a historical document from an amazing star for dedicated lovers only.
B0000640VO|3.0|Great movie - but the director talked over the entire movie. I could not get the director to keep quiet. why do i need to hear the director talk over the whole movie?
0385040253|4.0|I found this book to be both educational and entertaining. <br />As a beginning I found the diagrams hard to follow and sometimes lacking. <br />As a novice in knots tying and having the responsibilty of teaching young adults, this book was great for the history and use of knots but lacking in the illustrations needed for me to learn how to tie the knots.
B000286S8S|4.0|This is Van Halen's second greatest hits cd.  I think that it is a pretty good compilation of their career minus the Gary Cherone album. <br /> <br />Why it's good: <br />1. It does not make \\"Volume 1\\" obsolete.  It leaves off     Humans Being, Can't Get This Stuff No More, and Me Wise Magic. <br />2. All of the tracks are remastered. <br />3. Three new tracks with Sammy. <br />4. Pretty good song selection for an intro to the band. <br /> <br />Why it's not great: <br />1. 3 live tracks from \\"Right Here Right Now.\\"  Why not add a couple more DLR songs,  a couple more from \\"Balance,\\" or maybe (gasp) some songs from VH3. <br />2. Sammy and DLR tracks are mixed together.  This doesn't bother me too much since I listen to it on shuffle anyway. <br />3. Might have been better as \\"Volume 2\\" by taking off all of the songs on \\"Volume 1\\", removing the three live tracks, and making it a single disc. <br />4. It might have been interesting to do what Def Leppard did on their new greatest hits package and get fan input.  Have disc one be \\"Greatest Hits Vol. 1\\" and disc two be selected by the fans. <br />5. I am one of the few fans who liked \\"Van Halen III.\\"  Could have added a couple of songs with Gary on vocals. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that this is a good package.  If you like Van Halen and don't have all of their stuff, buy it. I bought it for the new tracks and the remastered songs.  I don't really feel like buying the remasters.
B00005LIN0|4.0|This performance is not true to the original where, at the finale, Porgy calls for his goat and cart to take him to \\"Noo\\" York City. He hobbles on and exits to the memorable last strains of the Gershwin score. For whatever reason, this all-too-important ending has been cut and revamped. Otherwise, a 5-star performance. The voices are magnificent, especially in the technically difficult ensemble pieces. <br /> <br />James R. Leeds, Ph.D. <br />Music Education
0316168815|3.0|The Lovely Bones was pretty hyped this year - it even had a cameo on Family Guy which displayed a group of middle aged book club females grueling over Susie's mother's decision to leave.  While Seabold's envisionment of heaven is somewhat intriguing her decision to incorporate a \\"return to earth so she can bang her old crush through her lesbian friends body\\" was a bit far-fetched.  Ahhh, if only after we died we could zip back down to the planet and get laid.  The most intriguing character in my humble opinion was Susie's father, his emotion in the book is the most prevalent and his scenes evoke sadness in the reader. The story started out strong and lost it's touch towards the end and often I would find myself wondering if I would even finish the story... I was getting bored.  It had it's ups and downs; being that this was Sebold's freshman attempt I would venture to guess that she's on the right track, but doesn't quite have it yet.

B000777J2S|5.0|Wow! This was my first impression after hearing \\"I am a bird now\\" as someone who has heard Antony and the Johnsons music for the very first time and being immediately drawn to his amazing voice and startling music accompanying him. An impressive list of guest stars make a fine contribution but in the end it's all Antony and his haunting and beautiful voice dominating the  record. Of course the band itself with the wonderful melodies, guitar work make it that more effective and perfectly suiting the voice. <br /> <br />After 3/4 of the year already behind, this is already one of my top 5 favorite records of the year, along CocoRosie's \\"Noah Ark\\" probably on the very top of it. Even if you're into more noisy, raw, guitar driven music you still might love this stuff as I did, a person normally more into music like Sonic Youth, Jesus Lizard or Fantomas, but thanks to Antony and The Johnsons expanding my musical horizons into genres (if one could actually put it anywhere) I probably would never discover or listen to. That's say a lot about it! :) <br /> <br />This is a record full of soul (with a bluesy edge), heart and outmost beauty. <br /> <br />Highly recommended! :)

B0002BO0HG|5.0|I can't quite find the talent to write a perfect review for this stellar album, but it's beautiful and unique, in the simplest meaning of those words.     There's a swollen pain in Antony's voice that reflects emotional (and perhaps physical) injuries he speaks of in his lyrics.         Listen to this and the newer album \\"I Am a Bird Now\\". Just listen. It's powerful, impressive music. I just can't find the most accurate words to describe his soaring, glamorous voice. Perhaps \\"majestic\\" works.
B00000099Y|5.0|i could write an epic review on how much tool moves me and what not but who wants to read all that? simply put, i have over 4,000 songs on my comp and nothing scales with tool. this is one of the best albums by the best artists.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Just got the DVD version for the deleted scenes..I dunno if Im glad they took all of that out or not...I mean sure, some weird woman running around watching everyone..then they start getting killed off...eh...that answered the few questions i had about the film..how could Hank have gotten into the tunnels if they heard someone running upstairs..hmm...I did like the alternate ending though..THAT wouldve been good. I really liked the Haunted Castle documentary they did..extra creepy..too bad theyre tearing half of the place down and selling it as apartments
B00006BTCA|5.0|Being an Interpol fan, and absolutely loving \\"Antics\\", I was critical of their previous album \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\", because I wasn't sure it could live up to such a great album as \\"Antics\\".  After listening to the cd (my favorite being #3 NYC), I was very wrong;  \\"Bright Lights\\" is a wonderful cd, the perfect addition to any Interpol fan's CD collection.  If you like Interpol in the slightest, this CD is a must have.

1892005034|1.0|This book is heaped with patronizing, self-serving junk.  The teachings in the book have extremely little practical use.  I have read many useful self-help books.  Some are great, and some are mediocre.  This NVC book is simply bad.
0596007124|5.0|Picked up my copy of Head First Design Patterns today (I'd ordered it in a couple of weeks ago). So far I'm loving it. <br /> <br />I'd been eyeing this book off for a while since reading the sample chapter for this and for Head First Java. The presentation style looks like it should be childish and silly, but it is amazingly effective. <br /> <br />The sample chapter, for example, made me look at Decorator in a new light. I thought I knew how Decorator worked and what it could be used for, but the sample chapter offered new possibilities, particularly for decorating Command objects. In addition, it helped expose me to new ways to explain the pattern, which is always a good thing. <br /> <br />So, based on the sample, I made my decision to buy. I'm not looking to learn a heap from this book about design patterns themselves, but I fully expect to see a few new possibilities, plus some excellent ways to teach the patterns to others. So far, I'm two chapters in (which means I'm really three, as the sample chapter was chapter 3), and it's living up to my expectations - the introduction alone demonstrated the power of the Strategy pattern in a new way, and at a much finer level of granularity then I had previously thought of taking it to. Before reading this, I'd never considered using Strategy to share behaviour between subclasses, for example. <br /> <br />Take my advice: buy this book. Even if you're not a Java developer, pick it up anyway. Even if you think you know everything about patterns, buy this book. Even if you are one of the Gang of Four, buy this book - unless you're Erich Gamma, because then you helped review it, and so I presume you've already got a copy. :)
B00003CXTG|2.0|To me PEARL HARBOR is the best \\"war\\" movie that I ever saw. However, this movie is really a love story about two men in love with the same woman. The attack on Pearl Harbor is a mere backdrop for the basic plotline. <br /> <br />Visually, this film is full of beautiful shots of  planes \\"soaring against the sky.\\" Though I was born four years after the Day of Infamy, the battle scenes in the movie seem realistic to me, perhaps even more so than the usual B&W combat footage of the attack  that we see on the History Channel. <br /> <br />This movie makes an historical event come to life because we get to know the characters well enough to become attached to them as the plot unfolds. <br /> <br />The director, Michael Bey, did his job well; so did the special effects people. <br /> <br />The movie grabbed me and held me for over three hours.

B00011F5DK|5.0|This is a game that took only a minute to learn, but will remain a challenge.  I was certain I could beat a 10 and 11 year-old at this, but was greatly amused when the youngest won the first game, and the elder child won the second round.  Having never played before purchasing it, I would now rank Blokus as one of my favorites.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|This was really a very good movie! When i first saw the previews on TV, I thought of \\"Hustle\\" in a different way than the movie obviously meant it to mean. What a pleasant surprise. If you're a fan of asian movies, and more importantly, martial arts movies, then you MUST see this movie. It has a lot of great qualities, including a really nice ending. I rented it, and now I'm going to buy it.
0780628551|5.0|But it turns out it's just as cold and creepy on Earth, and cold is just how this chilly little Something-in-Outer-space-got-my-Astronaut-Husband flick serves it up. \\"The Astronaut's Wife\\" is a stylish, nastily clever, absolutely heartless, efficiently paced and admirably designed little gem of a horror movie, centering on the crux of everyone's worst fears: what if the love of my life is a ghoulish space alien who plans on destroying Earth?<br /><br />When I was a little kid, I remember being scared silly by tales of outer space terror and body-snatching on those creepy \\"Outer Limits\\" and \\"The Twilight Zone\\" episodes. Everyone has seen at least one variation on the theme: the noble, heroic astronaut with the jutting jaw and confident swagger goes off on the Antares IV Expedition/Rocket Shoot to Planet X/Mission to the Moon, but when he comes back he's no longer himself. He's one of Them---a leering, skulking, alien horror, waiting to turn the tables on his unwitting friends, relatives, and fellow NASA employees.<br /><br />That's what \\"The Astronaut's Wife\\" feels like to me: a really creepy \\"Outer Limits\\" episode with a decent budget, plus Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron. Johnny Depp is perfect as the swaggering Commander Spencer Armacost, who goes up on a routine near-Earth orbit mission with his partner (played admirably by Nick Cassavetes---see, \\"Astronaut's Wife\\" is just one degree of separation from \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" after all!) one tragic day.<br /><br />There is a mysterious and inexplicable electrical surge, the mission is aborted, and Armacost goes from doting husband to skulking, leering creep in one fell swoop.<br /><br />He acquires some interesting new habits as well, like spending quality time with the family radio. He also gets a gig as a consultant for a secret weapons lab (run by the original serial killing 'Tooth Fairy' from \\"Manhunter\\", the creepy Tom Noonan).<br /><br />Charlize Theron turns in a sympathetic performance as a wife who---well, dang it, she likes the high society and the big bucks just fine, but she wishes Johnny Depp would spend less time with the radio and a little more time with her.<br /><br />Her suspicions mount when a former NASA employee (the great Joe Morton doing his nervous-tic-eye-twitching paranoid thang here)tries frantically to meet with her and communicate his worst fears (that possibly her husband's quality time with the radio has something to do with the fact that he may, in fact, be a Space Alien)and the movie spends most of the rest of its time with Theron in a cat and mouse game with Depp, who, when he's not cozying up to the radio, is skulking around the house switching off lights and doing horrible things to Theron's sister (played by the always resourcefully creepy Clea Duvall). Director Rand Ravitch employs a steady hand and brings things to a boil---all cold, sleek, and subtle.<br /><br />If you got creeped out by the old \\"Outer Limits\\" shows, you'll love it.<br /><br />JSGwho---well, dang it, she likes the high society and the big bucks just fine, but she wishes Johnny Depp would spend less time with the radio and a little more time with her.  <br /> <br />Her suspicions mount when a former NASA employee (the great Joe Morton doing his nervous-tic-eye-twitching paranoid thang here)tries frantically to meet with her and communicate his worst fears (that possibly her husband's quality time with the radio has something to do with the fact that he may, in fact, be a Space Alien)and the movie spends most of the rest of its time with Theron in a cat and mouse game with Depp, who, when he's not cozying up to the radio, is skulking around the house switching off lights and doing horrible things to Theron's sister (played by the always resourcefully creepy Clea Duvall).

B0001BKAEY|3.0|We know from our indoctrination into the philosophy of the Matrix movies that there are two worlds: one is the waking dream that is the \\"Matrix\\", a world generated by the Machines to keep us shackled in illusion while we're used as living batteries. Tne second world is that of the Desert of the Real: you have no job. You have no cubicle. You have no rent-controlled apartment with a nosy landlord.<br /><br />Everything you see before you, all the \\"evidence\\" of your senses, is an ambitious fraud: you are kept in a cocoon, envatted in a snare of pink fluid and dreams, convinced you live and walk and talk and breathe the air of a free man in a free society.<br /><br />In other words: the Real, and the Illusory. The Wachowski Brothers have made a great flick technically (ie: the realm of the illusory): they have stormed the ramparts of what great cinema should look like, and---who knows?---stormed the ramparts of how movies should be made.<br /><br />They have also churned out a flick that betrays the rich ideas of the first film. In the same spirit, and because it is unfair to \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" to judge it according to either its technical flair or its philosophical limitations, I shall provide a rare dual review, also in keeping with the dual realities of the Matrix.<br /><br />MATRIX REVIEW(The World of Illusion): 5 stars out of 5. My God this movie looks great! This flick cost 150 million smackers to make, and every penny---every red cent---of that budget is up on the screen! Look at the dual, perhaps triplicate, realities the Wachowskis have conjured up: the slick, techno, ephemeral, ghost-green world of the Matrix, green-hued, lorded over by the fast-talking Merovingian, the consummate Rabbit hole-within-Rabbit-hole. So gorgeous it makes you wish you'd taken the Blue Pill. Maybe there's still time?<br /><br />Anyway, the flick looks amazing. Even if you're disgusted with it, pop it back into the hopper, and look at the thing! Look at the ropy steel-and-red-burning-laser-eye contraptions of the Sentinels, or the gigantic drill that burrows through the rooftop to Zion and then plummets to the floor of the cavern below! This is simply one of the greatest, most hyper-kinetic action flicks ever filmed; the fear in the Great Hall when the battle mechas confront the swarming sentinel reeks of war and sweat and death and fear. I love it!<br /><br />Classic. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith (the great Hugo Weaving in his generation-defining, massively quoted role) is one for the ages: the rain, the generic cityscape, the rows and rows and rows of Agent Smiths watching from the streets, from the windows of the otherwise vacant office buildings. Brrrr.<br /><br />ZION REVIEW(The Desert of the Real): 1 out of 5 Stars. Blah! Desert of the Real is right: great characters from \\"The Matrix\\" go through the motions: Neo (Keanu Reeves)sleepwalks through his role, Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) looks like he's about ready to call out for a pizza---someone should have budgeted for Fishburne a personal trainer, or at the least put the big guy on the Atkins diet.<br /><br />Trinity (the nimble Carrie Anne Moss) provides earnest eye candy. Neo (Keanu Reeves) does his Neo-thang. Nothing is resolved. Heretical yet intriguing theories provoked by \\"Matrix Reloaded\\" (the \\"Matrix-within-a-Matrix\\" theory suggested by Neo's ability to stop the sentinels in the \\"real\\" world) are nodded to and then ignored. Yes, the trailer promised us great things---\\"It all ends tonight\\"---but we get zero delivery. The huge questions---does any of this matter? Is Zion Real?---are ignored.<br /><br />Alright. Real World: 1 Star. Matrix World: (all the CGI goodies and cinematic wizardry): 5 Stars. Listen to Hugo Weaving's dialogue; Weaving, as Agent Smith/Bane, completely owns this movie and gives it its black wicked heart. Bully to him! Sample the raw sheer audacious techno style of the Merovingian (the incomparable Lambert Wilson), who found French to be the superlativelanguage of the Insult.<br /><br />Ogle Monica Belluci (the luscious Persephone), who just looks ripe. Wonder how Harvard law prof and Ivy League resident crackpot ever bribed the Wachowskis to be in this movie. Just don't expect any answers, deep meaning, or conclusions. What, you thought you'd find the meaning of Life in a blockbuster flick? Sheesh.<br /><br />It's stylish, it's wicked black, it bumps and grinds, it's pretty cool. Ultimately it answers none of the questions. Do you care? Take the Blue Pill! Take the Red Pill! You'll find that with \\"Matrix Revolutions\\" it makes no difference.<br /><br />JSGench to be the superlative language of the Insult.  <br /> <br />Ogle Monica Belluci (the luscious Persephone), who just looks ripe.

B0009S4IHY|4.0|This is a good movie, from every angle. The good winning over evil is an age old script. But Chow treated this in an entirely novel way. You won't get bored. You have almost everything in this action movie.  The photography, the brilliant computer graphics, nice (though sometimes too silly or stupid - don't ask \\"is it possible?\\") action scenes, different looking dance choreography, music, fun, comedy, elements of love, etc etc..  Stephen Chow is just brilliant. He showed the world that he is not just a comedian, but a great director too. <br /> <br />This DVD is best watched with a home theatre system, as it has got some 5.1 effect. This movie won't disappoint you, if what you want is just time pass. A great entertainer and I do recommend.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0009S4IHY|5.0|...was my reaction as i was watching this.  For those tired of conventional \\"by the numbers\\" movies turned out on a regular basis, this is a high recommendation.  You'll recognize the standard elements of story-telling/movie-making, but appreciate the non-standard approach it takes torwards them.<br /><br />What i really liked about this film and appreciate most from it:<br /><br />* it has a tacked on love story interest, but it is barely there on screen.  it has more heart to it than most romantic movies and you actually kinda wished it was explored a little more(as opposed to most tacked on love sub-plots when you wish it wasn't even there).<br /><br />* this is not an all-out comedy, but there are some really funny bits(the knife throwing scene, hair on fire scene, the calling all challengers out bluffing scene, etc).  some of the more subtle or verbal humor may be lost in the translation.  i strongly recommend watching the english-subtitled version for the humor(and the widescreen version for the visuals/action).<br /><br />* the cgi efx range from 'very good hollywood stuff', to 'kinda amateurish'.  however, i felt that even the amateurish efx scenes worked out ok considering the cartoony nature of some of the scenes and the overall outlandishness of the film.  the cgi efx really add an element of fun to the proceedings rather than trying to make eveything seem ultra-realistic.  besides, if you watched this hoping to see an ILM showcase ...you're obviously watching the wrong movie.<br /><br />* i was surprised by some of the overly-violent scenes in the film(in its defense though, it is R-rated, and some of the violence is rather cartoonish).  but i was even more pleasantly surprised at how much action/fighting there was.  this has more fights in it than some straight-foward action movies.  and the action choreography is very good as well.  it's not just all wire-work and cgi, there's some actual martial arts fighting with some really good kicks/weapons/hand to hand combat.<br /><br />* i really liked the characters: the two main down-trodden buddies, the martial arts expert couple(the wife is a certifiable scene-stealer), the two instrument-playing assassins, and the head of the axe-wielding gang.  in fact, these characters were so likable/interesting that the main fault i had with the film was that some of them were not given enough screen time or development(was i the only one hoping the married couple would get in on the action for the last fight, or at least the last scene?).<br /><br />Overall, you don't have to be a Stephen Chow fan, understand HK comedies, or enjoy kung fu films in general to enjoy KUNG FU HUSTLE.  But every little bit helps:-)  At worst, it makes for an interesting rental for that night that you just want to see something...er...different.  At best, it could be your next favorite quirky film that is a definite keeper.  I fall into the latter group.  Btw, 4 stars for the movie overall, 5 for the DVD presentation(plenty of good extras including deleted scenes, outtakes/bloopers, diretor/cast commentary, behind the scenes feature, poster gallery, Stephen Chow interview with Ric Meyers, subbed and dubbed options).mbat.   <br />* i really liked the characters: the two main down-trodden buddies, the martial arts expert couple(the wife is a certifiable scene-stealer), the two instrument-playing assassins, and the head of the axe-wielding gang.  in fact, these characters were so likable/interesting that the main fault i had with the film was that some of them were not given enough screen time or development(was i the only one hoping the married couple would get in on the action for the last fight, or at least the last scene?). <br /> <br />Overall, you don't have to be a Stephen Chow fan, understand HK comedies, or enjoy kung fu films in general to enjoy KUNG FU HUSTLE.

0385338686|4.0|This was my first experience with a Sophie Kinsella novel, and it's not really the kind of book I normally read.  But that said, I really enjoyed Undomestic Goddess and read it in two nights.  The plot is very predictable and there were no real surprises, but Kinsella's heroine is so likeable and the situations she finds herself in are so amusing, that the predictability can be forgiven.  I have found myself recommending Undomestic Goddess to friends and family, which is the best compliment you can give a book.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|.. i thought I'd stay with the outrageous previous reviewer's penchant for punning on Bruce's song titles, but there I'd like to diverge. If an artist publicly aligns his or herself with or against a politician then he or she can be said to have entered a public debate and expect to be joined in battle by those who disagree but, really.. calling the Dixie Chicks 'Dicks', John Fogerty 'a fag', Sheryl Crow 'a whore' and comparing Kerry to Hitler says far more about the twisted psyche of the name-caller (and about the kind of person who supports Dubya despite his works) than about the subjects or the issues. Smears are no substitute for analysis or informed comment. And defending the actions of your country by saying other countries are worse is EXACTLY the kind of argument used by Hitler and his kind.  Anyway (yawn) the album: <br />a solid introduction to those who want to know what the fuss is about but a caveat is - listen to Darkness, Born To Run, Nebraska, and Tunnel Of Love too, if not first of all. Each is a classic.
0790729350|4.0|This film is very interesting because it is like having a bird's eye view of such a unique time in the country's history. The film opens with someone from a band called \\"Ten Years After,\\" the lead singer looking like Kent from Begosian's film \\"Talk Radio,\\" and the man is strung out on something, repeating over and over again how he is going to \\"go home to see his baby.\\"   One gets an overpowering sense of how lost these kids were and how badly they wanted to find the answers. Footage of John Sebastian, Santana(young Carlos on guitar) and others gives a great insight into the anti-war madness during Vietnam.  God bless the flower children, because their intentions were good.  Of course, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009AOBI|4.0|An engaging drama about a 16-year-old boy, Rocky Dennis (played by Eric Stoltz), who has a terribly disfiguring bone disease (same illness as the Elephant Man), but also has an incredibly positive outlook on life to go with it. Cher is his mother, who runs around with bikers and takes dope. It's a case of the child being the father to the woman, yet, although he would like his mother to change her ways, he is not critical of her. Her biker friends and Rocky get along marvelously, like an extended family. Cher treats the boy like hard tacks, which seems harsh at times, but is basically best for all concerned. The only misstep is the teenage romance between Rocky and a blind girl played by Laura Dern: it's overy sentimental (it reminded me of the blind girl in FRANKENSTEIN). Perhaps the pathos run a bit thick, but the movie is a moving experience despite that. Based on a true story. Worth a watch.

B0000AI45P|5.0|I heard Patti Smith say that Tom Verlaine played guitar \\"like a thousand bluebirds screaming.\\"  A peculiar comment, but an accurate one.  The ten-minute title track of Marquee Moon contains a long solo of Verlaine dueling with Richard Lloyd, and it does sound like a thousand bluebirds screaming.  Of course, this album is so often namechecked by modern bands it's become cliche to mention it, but it truly is a great album.  I won't go into details...it's too difficult to describe a band like Television with things so trivial as words.  Get this album and experience it for yourself.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having never been given the chance to watch this series on television here in Australia, I was lucky enough to be able to watch some of the first episode at a friends house. Once I had I was hooked - and had to buy the series. And I am glad I did. Deep multilayered storylines, characters that are inherently flawed and human, but ones you truly care about. Drama and action in a universe that is so achingly familiar yet alien (without \\"aliens\\") - everyone knows a little mandarin (to curse at least) and the \\"frontier\\" planets are just like they would be - a mixture of the old and the new. The mixed cultures shine through brilliantly and show us a world where the various religions and faiths obviously co-exist. It also shows us a flipside to the shiny, polished universe we have been fed from Star Trek, which we all know isn't how it is going to be. <br /> <br />Now that the film is due out in September, I am now eagerly looking forward to it... this DVD series has given me alot of stories that I am sure they will gloss over or not go into in depth in the film. <br /> <br />I recommend this series to anybody that likes good story, plot, characterizations and a depth that can only be truly realised by multiple viewings.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|Just like Gorillaz are equal to or possibly better than Blur (and definitely better than Damon Albarn's solo stuff), Eagles of Death Metal are potentially better than Queens of the Stone Age.  Don't get me wrong, Queens of the Stone Age are great, but Eagles of Death Metal are more my style.  To me, it sound the way the White Stripes would sound if they had listened to Blue Oyster Cult instead of Loretta Lynn.
0385338082|5.0|Even better in my opinion than Confessions of a shopaholic is Kinsella's Can You Keep A Secret. From cover to cover, it was lighthearted, entertaining, and dramatic in a way that only Sophie Kinsella can accomplish.
B000068OSK|5.0|...in my opinion at least.  The White Stripes debut album is Detroit put to record.  I live near Detroit so I go there all the time, but I won't try to say that I live in the ghetto.  Anyway, if you have heard this album and have been to Detroit you will know what I mean.  This album is fantastic.  From Meg's opening booms of \\"Jimmy the Exploder\\", to Soledad Brother Johnny Walker's last slide guitar wails of \\"I Fought Piranhas\\", this album is everything an album should be.  The cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\" is a contender for the best White Stripes song of all time, and \\"Cannon\\" and \\"Screwdriver\\" are definitely two of Jack and Meg's strongest songs.  All in all, this is my favorite White Stripes album, and has not gotten nearly as much credit as De Stijl, White Blood Cells, Elephant, or Get Behind Me Satan.  This album sounds reminiscent of many of the New York white-noise bands of the late 70's who got their start at the CBGB's.  If you're lookin' for a thrill, then buy this album in a heartbeat.
B0001FGBL6|4.0|Epica, with the word Epic already in the name, there is little left to the imagination. The songs are very medieval and over dramatic. Think Sonata Arctica's \\"Winterheart Guild\\" dramatic, now cross that with Nightwish vocals and you sort of get the idea. Most of the songs are nightly, best played with the blistering moon shimmering through your window, awaiting a spirit to come and take your soul. \\"The Phantom Agony\\" is as epic as it gets when it comes to gothic metal. The songs are not mostly about romance and the failed morbidity of it (did I just coin a word). In the songs lie a story, these songs would fit any gothic horror film, only if it took place in a medieval era. The vocals are very Tarja T. from Nightwish, while the music is very power metal with gothic drops and hints. The guitar riffs build and build until it orgasms into some high note trauma, bleeding at the zeneth of something jaw dropping. It is very beautiful, but admittingly, at times it can get boring and feels overdone. That does not mean Epica is not putting on one hell of an album together. It is very Lord of the Rings, in terms of action. You can almost judge this album like a movie. There is drama, action, there is pace and rhythm, and eventually everything builds up. The songs on \\"The Phantom Agony\\" run more like a soundtrack. The vocals are male and female. The typical beauty and the beast, if you love it, you love it, if you hate it, you hate it. Simple as that. Epica might seem  very cliche' and like every other band in the genre, but they are taking everything in terms of the music to excess. Still very well orchastrated, and elegant. For fans of Nightwish, Theatre of Tragedy, The Sins of thy Beloved, and Tristania.
B00003CXSM|5.0|Being a fan of romantic comedies, I decided to give `The Wedding Planner' a try. While this may not be the best movie that I have seen from this genre, I was pleased with it as it lived up to my expectations. <br /> <br />Mary Fiore (Jennifer Lopez) is one of the best wedding planners, but leads a solitude life outside her work by spending time with her father playing scrabble. One day a man saves her life from a runaway dumpster, and Mary starts getting feelings for him. Mary's friend Penny (Judy Greer) sets up Mary and Steve Edison (Matthew McConaughey) the doctor who saved her life, on a date. Just when Mary feels like she has found Mr. Perfect, she finds out that Steve is the groom for one of the weddings that she is planning! Furthermore, her father sets her up with Massimo (Justin Chambers), a man Mary doesn't want to get involved with.  <br /> <br />This movie had a lot of funny moments like:  <br />i. every scene with Penny in it. It was such a delight to see Judy Greer play a comedy role for once. I've only seen her play negative roles in movies like `Cursed' and '13 Going on 30' and it was such a change to see how funny she was here. <br />ii. When Massimo and Steve try to out beat each other in the beginning. Actually, even Justin Chambers who played Massimo was funny in most of the scenes. <br />iii. The horse riding scene. It was hilarious to see Mary trying to control the crazed horse.  <br /> <br />Director Adam Shankman (who also directed `A Walk To Remember') did a fine job in this movie. Okay, Okay, so the story is predictable, and the actors overdid their Italian accents, but you cannot help but feel for them while you are watching it. Jennifer Lopez, Judy Greer, Justin Chambers, Alex Rocco and everyone else did a great job for their roles. I was a little disappointed with Matthew McConaughey since he kept portraying the same clueless looks and emotions throughout the movie, but he didn't too such a bad job either. <br />  <br />In short, this isa breezy romantic comedy that anyone would enjoy watching. If you liked this movie, then you will surely enjoy \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" or \\"Never Been Kissed\\".
B00005JNTX|1.0|The director promised a big 3DVD disc that lengthened the story on each of the episodes. The DVD they are releasing now is actually a barebones one. I say that if you actually want more for your money you should wait until the holidays.

B00082IJ08|4.0|welp, needless to say, they've done it again. revamped star studded lineup... same loveable guise... Although Del Tha Funkee Homosapien and Dan the Automator opted not to return for this episode, rest assured, with Danger Mouse manning the production helms, and appearances by MF Doom, De La Soul, and Roots Manuva, the result still ends up in 15 mindnumbing tracks, each progressively more haunting than the one before. Before getting caught up in the facade of the loveable cartoon characters that overtake the personas of the various Gorillaz, understand that it's just that they're trying to get you to see through...that which isn't real. the blurred line between reality and fantasy becomes a bit clearer when these characters ask questions such as 'are we the last living souls' and follow it with a disturbingly real 'kids with guns' chant. throw in a childrens' choir, a hope-strewn london gospel choir, and a sick beat bangin behind Dennis Hopper's telling the story of the happy people's 'dance of the dead' after their land was invaded and destroyed by the strange folk, and you're left shaking your hips to quite a sobering take on the dismal reality our predecessors have created. These characters are as real as life is.  (...)
B000059Z8J|3.0|Superman is, to my knowledge, one of the first seamless integrations of action, adventure, comedy, and romance. It is a classic, and deservedly so; however, the times have changed. Movies used to be devoid of any complexity; as such, it was not a problem that the plot of Superman can be easily summarized in one or two sentences.  The simplicity was perfectly acceptable, as simplicity was expected. Movies were not meant to make you think.  Nowadays, on the other hand, even the silliest movies involve complex plot twists and various subplots.  They make your mind do gymnastics, whether or not you realize it.  If you watch Superman  today, expecting a movie that will blow you away in the context of modern movies, you'll be enormously dissapointed.  It's not what you would expect to see, even if you thorougly enjoyed this very same movie just a few decades ago (and hence the distorted ratings from those who merely remember enjoying the movie, without watching it before reviewing it). If, on the other hand, you view it from the perspective of 1978 cinematography, you'll understand what made this movie great. I really do hate to give Superman a mediocre rating, as doing so is completely anachronistic and unfair. Unfortunetely, I can't change my perspective: I am watching this movie in 2005, in the shadows of more modern movies. Hopefully, unlike myself, you'll be able to change your perspective in order to take part in this incredible adventure.
0399241515|5.0|The fifth book of the Alex Rider series, \\"Scorpia,\\" by Anthony Horowitz has Alex Rider traveling to Venice with his friend, Tom, for a vacation.  However, Alex also has another purpose for going there.  Yassen Gregorovich, an assassin who has tried to kill Alex and supposedly knew Alex's father, told him just before Yassen died in \\"Eagle Strike\\" that Alex should \\"Go to Venice. Find Scorpia. And you will find your destiny.\\"  Alex is curious to find out what Scorpia is, so he eagerly accepted Tom's invitation.  In Venice he finds his way to one of the leaders of Scorpia's house with a near deadly result.  Despite this, Scorpia finds out who Alex is and for numerous reasons wants him to become one of their assassins.  This unexpected turn of events begins \\"Scorpia,\\" where Alex strives to find what Yassen means.  Unfortunately, this discovery could very well cost Alex his life.<br /><br />\\"Scorpia\\" was nothing like the Alex Rider Adventures before it.  Whereas the other books had very similar plots, the plot in \\"Scorpia\\" was unpredictable and exciting.  I thought the idea of having Alex join Scorpia made it much different than all of the other books.  The climax of the book was breath- taking and after I finished the book, I found myself sweating.  The ending was quite tragic if you are an Alex Rider fan, but only until you find out there is a next book in the series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Seth Cassel for Flamingnet Book Reviews<br /><br />Preteen and Young Adult Book Reviews<br /><br />[...]
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This movie has touched my heart because it shows through the different story threads how many kinds of love exist, from the genuine affection between a widowed father and his son to the respect between work colleagues in the music business depending on each other, from shy first lovers to tribulations of a long married couple.  There are more story lines showing much finer nuances of love but why spoil the surprise.  Wonderful actors including favorites Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, Colin First and Bill Nighy make this romantic comedy absolute pleasure to watch.  Not all story lines end comfy/cosy but satisfy nevertheless.  Watch this and laugh about yourself as a human being.

068983571X|5.0|The image of Sherlock Holmes in 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' is perhaps the most enduring image we have of him. You see, an Inverness cloak and deerstalker cap are inappropriate wardrobe for the town, and belong in the country. Sherlock Holmes is predominantly a city dweller and city investigator; it is relatively uncommon that he treks out on adventures, but the case of the mysterious death of Sir Charles Baskerville and the attempted murder of Sir Henry Baskerville led him to the Dartmoor plain. Thus, country garb was in order. This is where we get much of our imagery.<br /><br />Also helping with this is that every major actor to play Holmes has considered 'Hound of the Baskervilles' to be the ultimate Holmes story to act -- rather like the Hamlet of Conan Doyle's work. Holmes was a popular film icon, and in the early decades of the twentieth century several dozen films were made of Holmes, but the first after these many films to be set in Victorian times (and not be updated for the screen) was a version of Hound. Ellie Norwood, Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing, Jeremy Brett -- many distinguished actors have considered this among their greatest roles.<br /><br />Watson dates the case to 1889, but various reading authorities, knowing the good doctor's occasional attempts to distort details to protect the privacy of the innocent, have dated this to between 1886 and 1900.<br /><br />In fact, the novel appeared in serialised form in the Strand magazine, the great first-publication site of most Holmesian tales, between August 1901 and April 1902, after Conan Doyle had attempted to kill off the great detective in the short story The Final Problem, which showcased Holmes' battle with Moriarity, the Napoleon of Crime. In fact, Conan Doyle came to dislike the character of Holmes because it was a distraction to his other pursuits.<br /><br />So, bowing to public pressure, Conan Doyle penned Hound of the Baskervilles to placate the public demand for more stories, but took care to place it before the death of Holmes, in the hopes that he could leave the detective safely dead (if not buried). Such was not to be, and we find a few years later that in fact Conan Doyle 'resurrects' Holmes in a rather ingenious fashion.<br /><br />But, on to the story at hand. Holmes and Watson, at home at 221b Baker Street, are approached by a Dr. James Mortimer regarding the death of Sir Charles Baskerville and a family curse which involved evil forces in the form of a satanic hound. Mortimer is concerned for the safety of the new proprietor of the family lands, freshly arriving from Canada, who had a new boot stolen, then an old boot stolen, in his hotel in London. Later Holmes would put together the significance of this seeming strange minor act (no, I won't tell you).<br /><br />Holmes sends Baskerville and Watson together to the country estate while he tends things in London on another case. In reality, Holmes is setting Watson up as a diversion, while he investigates the moor and the surroundings of the Baskerville estate under cover. Life at the estate is a bit strained, given the murder, an attempted murder, a curse, and all. The neighbours seem nice enough, though. Or are they? Watson picks up on curious little details of their relationship, which he reports back in written notes to Holmes (which have been redirected to his moor outpost).<br /><br />Eventually Holmes reveals himself to Watson, and then to Baskerville, and the chase is on in earnest, to discover the reality of the mysterious creature each have seen or heard. In good mystery fashion, we come across long lost relatives and an inheritance to be had; we find plots and subplots muddied by superstitious belief and fear, on a mysterious plain in southwestern England.<br /><br />All the elements combined that are now considered standard bits for a well-done country English mystery. But the mystery does not stop merely with the story. In true mystery fashion, appearing in the Daily Expressedition of March 16, 1959, there were doubts cast upon the authorship of Hound of the Baskervilles. The one who carried the dispute was named none other than Baskerville, Harry Baskerville. He credited the story to one Fletcher Robinson, who died (perhaps of the Egyptian mummy's curse) at age 35 shortly after the publication of Hound. With his death, only Baskerville remembered the issue of co-authorship. Baskerville claims it was Robinson who 'borrowed' the Baskerville name.<br /><br />One of Conan Doyle's heirs, Adrian Conan Doyle, heatedly denied involvement of Robinson past possible 'conversations' that might have taken place between Arthur Conan Doyle and Robinson. But, he did not deny Conan Doyle's possible 'inspiration' from Robinson.<br /><br />One Baker Street Irregular (an exclusive club of Holmesian experts) was doing a monograph on this issue as well, claiming that the reason why Holmes appears so infrequently is due to the fact that he had to be written in to an otherwise essentially completed story. This Irregular travelled to meet with Baskerville, and hinted at discoveries he had found. But alas, the Irregular died three weeks later in America, his monograph never published and his notes were never found. Perhaps a dog ate the homework?

B000053V7Q|4.0|I saw the original movie in the Seventies and I forgot how excellent this man's voice was. I enjoyed listening to all the songs. For the first time I even enjoyed Love me tender. Not so sentimental. By the looks of it Elvis enjoyed it as well.  <br /> <br />What I did not enjoy was the fact that on the DVD the part where Elvis, after working up to a tremendous crescendo, ended off  You Have Lost That Loving Feeling and then start again with the song, was removed. Some bits of Polk Salad Annie have been ommitted from the DVD. I bought the DVD specifically to enjoy those two songs in their entirety over and over again. <br /> <br />Of course many of the other parts of the original movie has been ommitted as well, but I can live with that. The energy and amazing voice of the singer softened my disappointment somehow. <br /> <br />Whether you are a fan or not (especially if you are not) this is the one DVD of Elvis you should have.  <br /> <br />Allan

B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble's CD's are always a treat. His smooth, sexy voice always makes for great listening, especially when driving.
B0000931OG|3.0|Err...this album is very strange. Well let's just say different. That sounds better. I really don't know a whole lot about blur (this was my first cd of theirs) except they are a brit pop/rock outfit with carismatic Damon Albarn at the reigns as the lead singer (also with the gorillas). This assessment is going to be very short. Think Tank seems more like an experimental studio session than a well constructed body of work. That's not neccisarily a bad thing but this album seems to have almost no cohesiveness. Each track is really it's own world. And some strange worlds they are. Blur seems utterly committed to using every sound effect and crazy noise within their grasp, sometimes complimenting the track; other times ruining it. There are a handful of good songs and a handful of just plain throwaways. Songs I'd recommend are \\"Out Of Time\\" \\"Good Song\\" \\"Sweet Song\\" and \\"Battery in Your leg.\\" These are all slower more melancholy songs but thats what seems to work best on here. \\"On The Way to The Club\\" is also ok but forgettable. \\"Crazy Beat\\" would be a good straightforward rock song if it wasn't for this munchkin voice saying \\"crazy beat\\" over and over again throughout the song (It's soooo annoying). You should go into this with an open mind because there are some classic songs here. You just have to wade through the sometimes unlistenable music to get to em. Since this CD is so different though, picking out the good and bad tracks is a very subjective process. I had fun listening to Think Tank but i wouldn't pay full price for it. Perhaps check out Blur's earlier stuff? I know I will.

This is by no means the bands best work. On the other hand, if you enjoy artists like Keane, Howie Day,or Kelly Clarkson then this is \\"like totally\\" for you.....
0784010501|2.0|Holy S***! Enough said. And I own the IMMACULATE COLLECTION album and love it. 1 1/2 stars. Terrific as a film record of American narcissism, crapshoot superstardom, and arrested development. She's never going to exit from adolescence, is she? She was 33 years old when this was made. Unbelievable. (Not to take away from her prowess as a businesswoman or promoter--no quarrel, there!)----Okay...I can see from the other reviews that I'm reacting to the person rather than to the product. Yeah, the documentary was done very competently. But Madonna, the person, is just soooooo annoying.**(I wrote this little review in August 2005. Now it's April 2008. I just saw a Madonna interview where she talked about how self-centered she used to be and how glad she is that she's not like that anymore. So I think what I said above is fair, except the part about growing up. Looks like she made it, after all.)
B00000373U|5.0|I went into all the Elliott Smith hype very sceptically. Everyone just raving and raving, saying he was our generations bob dylan i think i heard a couple of times. Nine times out of ten don't believe the hype. Elliott, however, is one of those rare exceptions. I really don't see where the Bob Dylan similarities come in. They are both incredible poets and play acoutsic guitar but thats about it. Leave \\"The New Bob Dylan\\" label with Bright Eyes. So anyways, this is a classic record. I mean absoluetly flawless. He can play acoustic guitar like a god and crafts intricate, beautiful melodies which compliment his gorgeous voice. Every Song has so much depth to it. You could listen to this album forever and still be completely enthralled. In fact it gets better after every listen. Not very many artists can do that. I personally fell in love with \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\" \\"2:45 am\\" and \\"Between the Bars\\" but there isn't one bad or filler track on here. Well maybe cupid's trick, but that's debatable; its a solid song with some infectious guitar work. This is a good CD to just hang out with, get a little drunk, and possibly wallow a bit if that's your thing. This certainly isn't a \\"happy\\" album, but that's not what elliott was about anyway. And I love him for it.<br /><br />This is an essential addition to your music collection. His other work is also fantastic. His last three projects were considerably more produced than this, but that's understandable with being picked up by a big label and all. His first two cd's are very very sparse, but brilliant just the same. It's a tragedy there won't be anymore.<br /><br />Either/Or is a great introduction to E.S. Buy It.
B00005JMAH|4.0|Finally, a Harry Potter movie that feels like a movie. <br /> <br />I didn't think the first two movies were bad, but just stilted in terms of how they were filmed.  This one flows beautifully, with lush cinematography and scenes that uplift you (I'm thinking especially of the scene where Harry flies on the back of the hippogriff, with John Williams' brilliant music in the background).  The acting of Radcliffe, Grint and Watson has also improved from the prior films, and the supporting cast of eccentric adults is just as delicious. <br /> <br />Don't expect the movie to be so faithful to the book, though, especially in some of the final action sequences and in the interactions between Harry and his friends.  Hermione especially has little of the vulnerability that she displays in the book; also, in the Time-Turner sequence with Harry, she dominates nearly everything, though in the book it's the two of them running against time in more of a partnership, drawing from each other's strengths.  The movie also introduces two important elements from the book - the Marauders' Map and Harry's patronus - without truly delving into their signficance or explaining it, something it should have done for the sake of plot integrity. <br /> <br />Still, I loved it, as a wondrous movie, a great flight of the imagination.
B0000508U6|5.0|Parachutes is Codplay's first release and also their best. It's quite low key which may turn off some people initially; for the most part lacking the soaring melodies of A Rush Of Blood To The Head and X&Y. This album is not driven by superficial pop crescendos but by a more artsy, folksy atmosphere. The songs are all catchy and easy to get into, but with a great depth and simplicity of sound that is in no way over the top like X&Y is and A Rush Of Blood To The Head showed hints of. With repeated listens this CD does not grow thin and transparent. The mark of any good Album. There are amazing folksy songs like \\"We Never Change\\" and \\"Sparks\\" along with great electric guitar work on \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Shiver.\\" \\"Trouble\\" is a great piano ballad nothing short of gorgeous. Parachutes is understated but that's why it's so brilliant. Don't get me wrong, I liked A Rush Of Blood to the Head as much as the next person, but X&Y seems a big step in the wrong direction to me. They need to go back to their original sound.<br /><br />Buy this. I swear you won't regret it. It's a gorgeous record.

B0002RNXNM|4.0|Chances are if you're reading this you've heard a Kasabian song one place or another (Probably \\"Club Foot\\" or \\"L.S.F.\\")and liked it. If this is in fact the case then you should buy this album immediately because you will surely like the rest of it. For those of you who haven't heard something by them, Kasabian are a U.K. band who dable in rock and electronic beats which produces some very good rock/pop songs with beats out of this world. This CD truly rocks and even though the band has put forth a dark mysterious image, it's not \\"heavy\\" but any means. It makes you want to get up and MOVE. The lead singer's voice is infectious and just begs for you to sing along with him. There's not a bad song on here either. This is one of those rare CD's you can listen to all the way through, in fact, it's better that way. It's a cohesive album and songs blend right into one another. Kasabian truly created a soundscape on this record that is pure joy to listen to. I gave this album only 4 stars however, because of the lyrical quality. But really that's not where Kasabian win their audience; they excell in the music and they are very very good at what they do.
B000089RVX|2.0|While I was my gf's house today she introduced me to this band saying their one of the greatest of all time........... After 2 songs I knew already this cd wouldn't contain any rockers.  The more the cd played the more my ears hurt.  The music is terrible, I getting very sick of hearing amy lee piss and moan about how sad she is awww poor baby .  The only reason teenage girls listen to her is because they feel they can \\"relate\\" to her pain.  Give me a break!!!! I saw an interview she did with VH1 and she self proclaimed herself a \\"Gothic Princess\\"  How arrogant can she be.  So she can write good lyrics, good for her but most anyone can write about depression if you think about it.  I'm not feeling this album nor will I ever feel it.  I'm sure I wont get any helpful reviews but the truth hurts.

B0001MDP3G|1.0|I expected \\"Cold Mountain\\" to live up to all the reviews and the fact that it was nominated for an Academy Award. I was very disappointed. Nicole Kidman couldn't act her way out of a paper bag although her hair was beautiful at all times. Jude Law had about a dozen lines to say and the rest of the time he spent looking anguished. Oh, but he DID walk a long way I guess. I would probably look anguished, too. The only saving grace in this film was Renee Z. But even she could not oversome the self-importance and just plain boringness of this production. I wish I could get my money back.

Ozzy Osbourne's vocals sound very different, but are still very good. This album also features one of the band's classic songs, N.I.B..

This is a more folk orignated album, with alot of acoustic, but still some electric. The lyrics are great and all are written by members of the band. Gary Louris vocals are as great as they ever were. Ethan Johns's production is amazing on this record. The Wallflowers' Jakob Dylan appears on the backing vocals of Come to the River. Favorites include  Stumbling Through the Dark, Tailspin, All the Right Reasons, Save It for a Rainy Day, Eyes of Sarah Jane, Don't Let the World Get in Your Way, Come to the River, Angelyne, Madman, and Will I See You in Heaven. Highly Recommended.
0553213105|4.0|I ordered this novel because as a senior this year in AP english we are required to read it. I always like to get a head start. First of all, I was very pleased with how fast I recieved the novel (Even under standard shipping). It was delivered earlier than I expected. Then once I started reading it I realized it was full of humor and I was eager to read the next chapter just to see how the plot would unfold. I would recomend this book and amazon.com to all readers who are looking for a no hassle way to keep up with your reading.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day's concept album is really creative. They center on the war on Iraq and America after 9/11 through the eyes of St. Jimmy. Bush's administration is center and called Jesus of Suburbia. Though some songs are a little poppy they fit perfectly  on this album. The music is beautiful all over this record. Armstrong's voice and lyrics are dark and compelling. Favorites inclued American Idiot, Jesus of Suburbia, City Of The Damned, Dearly Beloved, Holiday, Boulevard Of Broken Dreams, Are We Waiting, St. Jimmy, Give Me Novacaine, She's a Rebel, Letterbomb, Wake Me Up When September Ends, The Death Of St. Jimmy, Nobody Likes You, and Whatsername. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00006LLNV|5.0|This one the most hauntingly beautiful and most original soundtracks I have ever heard! Just listen to the incredible songs such as the authenicity and raw anger in Paloma Negra (by Chavela Vargas: Unparalleled!) or the freshness of La Bruja (Salma Hayek: What a surprise!) or the tension of Alcoba Azul (by Lila Downs), which are in stark in contrast to the exotic but fitting award winning score by Goldenthal. <br /> <br />It helps to see the movie, but also without it, this soundtrack is one out of thousand. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00026WU82|5.0|Bob Dylan's Highway 61 Revisted not only made Dylan's complete change from folk to rock, but it is probably his best all around album. A classic when first released, it still is a classic today. Dylan's songwriting some of the greatest songs ever written. Lke a Rolling Stone was Dylan's first big hit and it still has its gold even today. The production is really good and is brought out on this remastered edition. Favorites include Like a Rolling Stone, Tombstone Blues, It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry, From a Buick 6, Ballad of a Thin Man, Highway 61 Revisited, and Desolation Row. Highly Highly Recommended.
0967984602|5.0|A+++! This book is the perfect guide to building your own earthen oven, adding on a hand sculpted design, and it even shows you other design options.  It has everything you need for the basics of making a working earthen oven and then leaves tons of room for your own creativity and design ideas.  I really loved this book and we have already built a small prototype.  The author combines logic and science with creativity and art, you have to love it!

0679777547|5.0|Lucas Corso, the protagonist of this mystery, is an ethically flexible dealer in rare books. He takes an assignment to validate the authenticity of a satanic book which leads him all over Europe. Plenty of twists, turns, red herrings and action.<br /><br />Not at all like the movie The Ninth Gate, starring Johnny Depp (which is pretty darn good by itself). I need to re-read THE THREE MUSKETEERS. (Why was it called The Three Musketeers when there were actually four of them?)
B00005K3OT|4.0|The French attitude, the taste of chocolate, even Johnny Depp works in this entertaining look at what works and what doesn't.  One more time we learn that it is about love... and love wins again.  Yes there are sterotypes and yet they are just another part of the story.  Make some hot chocolate, or open a box of your favorites and enjoy this one.
0385335482|5.0|When I have money, I shop and then I find myself having less than what I would have had. Whether its a shirt I only half-like or a book I didn't fully research in regards to reviews and summaries, I begrudgingly find myself either 1) forcing my way through the book and 2) buying another article of clothing to make up for the ugliness of the first one.    Bad habits die hard and they do for Rebecca Bloomwood...sort of. I love this girl. I think many a young woman can relate to her. Mind you she's not the materialistic, 'Daddy can I please use your plastic?' type a female. She's actually an easy going, justice seeking, and optimistic sort of person. Her weaknesses for fetishes are our weaknesses and her 'excuses' are sort of a breath of fresh air because at least she's not telling herself 'Well, at least I've only slept with x guys instead of y number of guys like so and so'.     The best part is this book is that it isn't whiny although Rebecca has a tendency to rationalize too much. But of course, one will just have to read on their own to see what they think.    Really, I'm not into chick-lits but this book is an exception. I even laughed on the subway while reading this and now my mother, who reads nothing else besides trash tabloids, is soaking it in.
B0000640VO|5.0|Fun-Fun-Fun.  You will have tickles, laughs, rolling around fun with this one.  She may never get a part as well suited, he may never get anything again, but they work in Amelie.  I've seen it more time than I can remember and find new thing to see in every scene.  Watch what is happening in the background after you have seen the movie a few times, there is a second film back there.
B00004RF97|5.0|I have seen this movie now atleast four times and I still love it! Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant team up again to play the leading roles in this movie. Also James Stewart joins them to make this movie bursting with stars. These actors can never let you down and certainly won't in this movie! Although there is abundant comedy added in are the somewhat dramatic relationship between Hepburn and Grant which is best portrayed in the swimming pool/yar scene. Also Hepburn and Stewarts' characters have a bit of a romantic fling. Rounding out the cast are Ruth Hussey and John Howard who both have comedic timing as well. I don't know how this movie could get any better, it's simply \\"yar\\".
0312323859|5.0|I picked up this book at the local library in the just released section.  This isn't the type of book I usually read, but I thought I'd try it.  What a surprise!  I couldn't put this book down, finished it in two days, and didn't want it to end. Darcy is a self-centered, spoiled, shallow little rich girl who discovers what life is really about.  I chuckled at her ridiculous views of the world at the beginning of the story, and was so happy for her that I cried at the end of the story.  I will purchase this book and it will have a permanent spot in my library.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|That is what this movie basically is chaos. Sometimes it might be too crazy to believe, but I love it anyway! Although hated by the public when it was first released later it was looked at by other audiences and was loved. It was so loved that this movie is now in the American Film Institute. From everything to a fossil digging dog to chasing a leopard you will have to laugh at this movie. There are so many memorable scenes in this movie that I can't mention them all! If you like comedy at all you must see this movie!!!
B00006ZCFH|4.0|This disc has been in heavy rotation at my house since I purchased it two years ago; one of the most solid albums I own. It is short and it may be lacking lyrically, but this album more than makes up for it musically. We all know that Ms. Badu is capable of penning profound, thought-provoking lyrics, so I appreciate that this album is simpler. Less is more. Best tracks: \\"Bump It\\", \\"Back in the Day\\", and \\"I Want You.\\" TRUE RATING: 4 and a half stars.

0743455967|5.0|The only Stephen King book I had read until On Writing was The Shining when it first came out, and how long ago was that? But I figured that anyone who is as consistently successful as King is might have something worthwhile to say about writing. He does.<br /><br />On Writing really flows. I sat down and read the whole thing. I was interested in how King started out (in pulp magazines mainly, not a viable option these days) and in how he goes about writing a book. This was the eye-opening part for me. King says he comes up with an idea and writes a first draft. Apparently he doesn't spend a lot of time plotting and outlining and developing characters. Well, he does, but not separately from writing the draft. In other words, he gets right down to the fun part.<br /><br />On Writing made me want to get right down to work writing. Here is a writer that really seems to enjoy writing. So many writers seem to like having written, but not the act of writing itself. So even if horror is not your favorite genre, you can learn a lot from King about writing, and about enjoying writing.
B0006L16N8|2.0|First off, I am a HUGE Coldplay fan. But I was highly disappointed when I bought this album. As a matter of fact, I was quited pissed that I didnt download it for free. \\"Parachutes\\" was an amazing album along with \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" with each song making you feel connected. I would go into details of how great those albums were, but you can read those reviews from those.  <br /> <br />\\"X&Y\\". I don't know why everyone made such a big deal about it. Every song in the album is the same freakin thing! I tried to get used to it, but it was just such a disappointment that they went from so much creativity from their first 2 albums to this. You could usually listen to an entire Coldplay album non-stop, but this one, there were only 2 songs that I actually liked (\\"Square One\\" and \\"Fix You\\") and the rest were distractions. Pretty much crap.  <br /> <br />If you really want to hear what Coldplay is really about, I suggest purchasing their first two albums. And downloading this one. Or buy a bootleg from the street for 5 dollars. I'm so pissed how bad this album was!!! And to think that I bought this because I read the reviews here. Damn it.
B000060OFT|5.0|Either this one works for you or it does not.  It works for me.  Granted that it is way, way over the top, and some of the over-the-top doesn't work.  Granted that some of the actors have Shakespeare skills that are, to be charitable, sketchy.  Still this movie catches the spirit of a Shakespeare play better than any other movie  know.<br /><br />If it is a flawed movie, we might as well begin by recognizing that it is a flawed play, often overrated.  My favorite teacher observed that it isn't even a tragedy: it is a comedy gone wrong.  Comedies are about young lovers who intrigue to outsmart their elders.  R&J do exactly that, and fail to get away with it only through the barest accidents.  Likewise, tragedy is about character and R&J cannot be about character because they are too young to have any character.  R&J does have some glorious verse-some of the best Shakespeare ever wrote-but it has far too many strained couplets and near-pointless wordplay.<br /><br />But put all that aside.  Where Shakespeare succeeds magnificently (perhaps for the first time in his career) is in creating a coherent moral universe.  This is a play about hot bloods and itchy trigger fingers and the passion of first love.<br /><br />You can tell that Shakespeare understood it this way from the way he altered his sources.  In the sources, Juliet is 18 or 16; here she is just 13.  A source extends the story over nine months; Shakespeare compresses it to a week (\\"you won't believe what happened while you were away...\\").  A source makes the death of Tybalt mere accident; in the play, Romeo is inculpated.  All this creates the air of urgency and danger that the movie captures so well.<br /><br />Given all this appeal, it is unfortunate the characters' approach to the verse is, ahem, uneven.  Pete Postlethwaire made himself completely at home with Friar Lawrence.  Miriam Margolyes rather hams it up as Juliet's nurse, but then Shakespeare more or less wrote it that way.  Some of the smaller parts-Benvolio, Old Capulet-are little marvels of characterization.  Harold Perrineau as Mercutio is, unfortunately, a devil's bargain: the camp cross-dressing is a hoot, but the casting means that the strongest speeches fall to the weakest speaker.  Claire Danes looks her part as Juliet and can almost get her mouth around it.  Leonardo Di Caprio is himself, but -well, would we like it any better with Tom Cruise?<br /><br />In any event, there is so much to enjoy here that it is possible to forgive the shortcomings.  Not the best possible Romeo & Juliet, but it will do nicely until a better one comes along.smaller parts-Benvolio, Old Capulet-are little marvels of characterization.

B000002MIF|5.0|You can't go wrong with this album if you love the Smiths, it has tracks you can't find anywhere else and is a good introduction to the band's early period. <br /> <br />Message to \\"Shotgun Method\\":  If you actually think that the primary fan base for the Smiths and Morrissey are \\"limp-wristed emo kids (your tasteless homo-baiting is telling),\\" you truly are uninformed. In reality, Morrissey has a shockingly huge number of straight male fans. And females, like me, while we're at it. Not to mention his extreme popularity with Latinos.  Make these comments to some of his rough-looking, intimidating fans (there is one in particular at the end of the \\"Who Put the M in Manchester\\" DVD) at your own peril.  I guess you thought that it was a sure bet to make the \\"all Morrissey/Smiths fans are gay\\" statement, but, no.  Incidentially, Michael Stipe is a huge Morrissey fan.  And Robert Smith (who I also love) is famously jealous.   <br /> <br />New listeners--don't listen to people who say the Smiths are \\"gay!\\"  If you aren't moved by Morrissey's unmatched vocal delivery, I don't want to know you. <br />
B00003CXE7|3.0|The year 2000 has to be considered one of the worst movie years in recent memory.  As far as I'm concerned, none of the films nominated for Best Picture should have won, let alone nominated.  Which brings me to Gladiator, the best picture winner of that year.  This is probably the worst movie to win Best Picture since 1947 with Gentleman's Agreement.  Don't get me wrong.  The film is exciting with its chariots scenes and fights.  Russell Crowe given the lack of competition probably deserved his Best Actor.  Joaquin Phoenix is certainly effective in his supporting role.  It's just that this film has been done before.  If you like exciting, action packed film, this is for you.  If you want to see a real Best Picture winner, try the original Ben Hur.
B000819PKC|3.0|There is no doubt in my mind that Jamiroquai's best album was their second album \\"Return of the Space Cowboy\\". Their third album \\"Travelling Without Moving\\" was also good but was more commercial. Ever since then the group has lost some original members and the music just hasn't been as good. \\"Dynamite\\" has one or two good songs. It might be time for JK to finally kick the can with this latest album. Too bad because Jamiroquai is one of my all-time favorite bands.
B0006284JQ|1.0|I recently caught up with Briney Spears at one of her and her husband's backwoods mansions. Here's our conversation: <br /> <br />Me: Hey, Britn- Oh, sorry I must have caught you at a bad time, I'll come back when you put some clothes over your underwear. <br /> <br />Britney: These are my clothes. My heavy winter ones, actually. <br /> <br />Me: Oh, well, okay then. So...here's a question I know thousands have been waiting to ask you... <br /> <br />Britney: Yeah what is it? <br /> <br />Me: Sorry, got a little distracted by your figure. Anyway, my question was - when was it that Hollywood start recruiting whores for its record labels? <br /> <br />Britney: Well, I think I started the trend, back with \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\". The world thought I was, like, some innocent schoolgirl singing but I was trying to tell them all along, No, I'm just a mindless whore. A whore slash skank that is trying to infect the minds of kiddies and adults everywhere. And promote the walking STD model for all the girls out there. <br /> <br />Me: Huh. So, you were trying to be like a provacative skank that takes over the radio and TV like a f**king cancer? <br /> <br />Britney: Yep. <br /> <br />Me: What do you have to say to all the hard-working, decent adults out there who are struggling to correctly raise their kids in a world becoming dominated like b**ches like you? <br /> <br />Britney: [Laughs] Yeah, right. <br /> <br />Me: Yeah, right what? It was a question, not a joke. <br /> <br />Britney: Yeah. Decent, hard-working people? We have those in this country? <br /> <br />Me: Wow, you're more of a c**-licking motherf**king brainless broad than even I thought.  <br /> <br />Britney: KEV-IN! There's a meanie out here calling me names! <br /> <br />Kevin: [Emerging wearing tattered redneck clothing and holding a dead rabbit] Looky, my little sex doll - I caught dinner! <br /> <br />Britney: Kevin, shut up you dumb peice of trash! Did you hear me? This fellow is being mean! <br /><br />Kevin: That guy? He probably just wants to have sex with you.  <br /> <br />Britney: Do you? <br /> <br />Me: No, thanks, I'll save myself for someone worth my time. <br /> <br />Kevin: You sure? She's a wild one. <br /> <br />Me: I thought you were her husband, you f**king idiot. <br /> <br />Kevin: Dude, I'm sorry, but I don't feel like a threesome today. <br /> <br />Me: Wow, you both are disgusting people. Excuse me while I go and pray for the sake of our nation. Goodbye.

B0000001PW|4.0|I've only listened to this disc once since receiving it.  My first Elektric Band CD I bought in 1988: _Eye of the Beholder_.  By then Chick had a more or less permanent lineup until after _Beneath the Mask_.  I think the addition of Frank Gambale after the CD in question made a huge difference for the better in the band's career.  In my opinion, the best disc by this version of the Elektric Band is _Inside Out_, released I believe in 1990.  The tightness of the band at that point is what is suggested by the pinball game on the cover: machine-like, which to some will be offensive, but to others will be something superhuman and awesome.  I'm a bass player, and it's nice to hear where Patitucci got his start; but if you want to hear him realizing his own vision, I suggest especially his first two solo albums (_Patitucci_ and _On the Corner_).  His experiments with world music also merit attention.  The first two Patitucci albums happened before he moved from the Smith-Jackson Contrabass to the Yamaha stuff.  If nothing else, the first Elektric Band album is a good place to hear a bit of that Ken Smith bass - though I was disappointed that some tracks seemed to lack bass guitar entirely.  On the whole, a lot of tight bebop riffs and stuff, but I'd move on to _Eye of the Beholder_ and _Inside Out_ if I were you.

B000003Z12|5.0|After decades of guitar workmanship which included gigs such being Carlos Santana's sideman and lead guitar for super group Journey, Neal Schon is finally producing music which focuses on his guitar talent rather than focusing on making money.  This music will never be played on top 40 pop radio.  It's far too good for that.  It's powerful, moving, delicate and flawless.  Schon conveys many moods here from whimsical and dreamy to dark and powerful.  He still rocks out too.  All without lyrics.  If you've graduated beyond adolescent music and can appreciate great guitar talent or just play a guitar, you owe this one to yourself.
B000001DWG|5.0|Look this is your guys problem and i am gonna to try and not be mean, you guys cannot compare music of Andrew Wood and Eddie Vedder, they are two very lyrically gifted people, and have to very different signing styles. Vedder might have sounded grunge because of his more animalistic voice and growls, while wood's has a more melodic tone to it. I do prefer Vedder's more, it just happens to appeal more to me, but that doesn't mean i don't like wood's. Anyways, this album is freaking awesome and I love how Andrew Wood's voice seems to change the music to where it doesn't even sound like anything pearl jam would have done. Eventhough jeff and stone were in both. All in all if your a fan of music, you should buy this album, if you a fan of good writing you should buy this album,  you don't have to be someone who only listens to grunge, I mean if you appreciate good music, buy it, it is definately worth it

0156012197|4.0|This book is written and illustrated by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. He was born in Lyon, France on June 29, 1900. He was a pilot of French air force in Strasbourg in 1921. <br />After he turned to be twenty six years old, he flew to many cities in South Africa during Spanish civil war. <br />This story was written in New York city in 1940, after beginning of WW II.  <br />He died on July 31, 1944 his plane was shot down over the Mediterranean sea. <br /> <br />As I read about this story, I can see that the author has written about most of his experience.  <br />For example, he describes about the sky and the stars which he saw them from his plane during the war.  <br />I can understand that he loves peace. He also hates adults who are only interested in consequences.  <br /> <br />The story begins from where the author has landed on the Sahara desert. On that first night, he meets with the little prince who has came from the asteroid B-6i2 which is a very small planet. <br />The author is going to be friend with this really small curious prince. <br />This story is mostly narrated by the prince about the journey of how he has to get here to find his friend from all the way to earth.  <br />He has met a lot of different personality characters as a king, a conceited man, a tippler, a businessman, a lamplighter, and a geographer.  <br />They all live on each planet alone, by doing something unnecessary things.  <br />When he came to earth the first time, he had met with a fox which is very weird that is interested to be tame. The fox is very important character in this story because this fox is has a clue to the world secret. <br /> <br />The author of this book writes about the world of spirit beyond this visible world where people will live in peace and harmony.  <br />The way I think after about death is that spirits are not able to gone until they find the most important thing.  <br />The author of this book has already died, but I can see that he is still alive in this story. He is still in universe living and playing with the little prince. I hope they've met each other.  <br />This book is the perfect book for researching for a report and also to read for fun. It is a fiction story, and has fantasy with a soft childish poetry.  <br />It is deep story that you might have to read it over again to understand what the author has trying to say to readers. Make you to think what the most important thing in your life is. <br />

B0008ISM40|1.0|this is the worst nin album ever, no contest.  this might even be a candidate for worst album ever, if you consider expectations and how much an artist fell short of them.  this is terrible music.  i started listening to nin when broken came out and then fell in love with the group when downward spiral was released.  fragile tested my patience, but i played nice and did my tour of duty (bought the album, saw a concert). with teeth is so bad.  my gosh.  i don't know what happened to trent.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I was fortunate enough to catch part of them on PBS late one night.  While enjoyable (even through a 4\\" TV speaker) I was too sleepy to catch it all.  When I heard they were coming to Seattle, I decided that would be a nice thing to take my wife too.  I have never been more right.  The beautiful clarity of their voices and the tones which lift ones spirit were amazing.  I felt like I was listening to the voices of angels or at least a group of 4 female vocalists each with natural talent surpassing Celine Dion. We bought the first CD we could find. <br />Ignore the criticisms of the few musical snobs on here that don't appreciate beautiful sounds.  I love everything from traditional Celtic to New Age to Classic and this music merges some of the best from all those genre's.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I'll have to admit movies as of late have either been huge successes or major failures. You could say over the last 5 years maybe only 3 to 4 movies a year really stand out in people's minds, out of the hundreds of releases per year. This is bad, since movie ticket prices have risen quite a bit over the last few years too, making it hard for us to sleep at night after dishing out the coin for a crappy flick.<br /><br />Finally, though, Sin City came out. After seeing a teaser trailer on TV, I was instantly interested in seeing this movie. The trailer seemed made perfectly to attract the way-ward movie goers into seeing something, finally, worth seeing. I had no fore-knowledge before gonig to see this movie. I had not read any of the graphic novels from Miller and had no idea what any of the characters were like. I was imopressed with how well all of the characters were introduced and explained. The twisting sotry-lines did not take away anything from the over-al flow of the movie.<br /><br />As far as the black and white with hint of color(only at special times) was a great idea. Artisticlly it was a great turn for a graphic comic translation. Where as the Hulk, just plain made me cry when I saw it. Comic book movies have been a huge hit over the last 3 years. Startnig with X-Men back in 2000 then going to Spider Man, X2 and Spider Man 2 as well. Although Sin City isn't as big a commercial success as Spider Man or X-Men, the movie is sure to draw people to the name Sin City.<br /><br />If there is one flaw with this movie, I'd say the story is a bit drawn out in some places. And there is a bit of confusion at some points which make you stratch your head in wonder, but it does not take away anything from the over-all flow of the movie.<br /><br />Sin City is a great movie of 2005, right up there with Batman Begins and Star Wars Ep 3. Take a view of this one, it shall stand out.
068484267X|5.0|This is the most touching, real, and beautiful book ever written. I've read it while laughing, crying and sighing, with the childhood of Frank McCourt in Limerick playing vividly in my imagination.  If you enjoy the Diary of Anne Frank, this book is definitely for you.  A very similar read, it has the same feeling of childhood innocence versus the destruction of that innocence. <br /> <br />I was so intrigued that I had to read his follow-up, 'Tis.   <br /> <br />The movie is no comparison to the actual story, though worth a viewing.  The settings in the movie are as realistic as the ones McCourt painted in my mind while I was reading.
B0002S94OS|5.0|They just don't make bands like this anymore...pure, all-American Metal music! No Metalcore spin-off's, no emo-screamo vocals...just straight up, kick your ass, in your face Metal!!! These guys are the epitome of what American metal should be. It goes without saying that if you thought \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" was smokin'... This album will set you ablaze!  <br /> <br />As far as I'm concerned, these guys are the next PANTERA for me. They have found that magic formula for making great music and they have stuck to it. There aren't many frills, unless of course you count Chris Adler's furiously galloping drums, punishing riffs and unmatched fretwork a la Willy Adler and Mark Morgan, John Campell's Bass lines and Randy Blythe's choking vocals... then I guess this whole album could be considered one big frill. I really think Randy and the Boys got what it takes to go all the way with this thing, and I hope we can expect many more releases in the future.  <br /> <br />Details, details..., Chris Poland returns to lend his chops for another solo, as well as Alex Skolnick of TESTAMENT, both appear only on one track however, \\"Ashes Of The Wake\\". Other than that, these guys haven't deviated from their formula too much and if anything have only gotten better, just listen to track #4 \\"The Faded Line\\", I thought I was gonna pass out it's that good! Whew!  <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you like LAMB OF GOD you will love this album and chances are already have it. If you have never heard LAMB OF GOD, this album is just as good as any to start with, so get it. No doubt, this is one of the top 5 albums of 2004. <br />
6305165912|5.0|I had the privilege of seeing this film in the theatre, attending on the strong recommendation of a friend of mine in film school.  I had no idea that years later it would become, and remain, my all-time favorite movie.  I won't go into plot or character or name-dropping or anything here.  Check out one of the other reviews for that; and there are some good ones.  I just want to express how excellent this movie is, and recommend it to anyone and everyone.  You don't have to be a bowler, stoner, or nihilist to enjoy this classic.  You don't even have to be a fan of well-made, beautifully filmed, and hilariously-directed, albeit directionless, comedy.  But I do think you have to appreciate the fine art of the film quote.  Or at least love the small detail of the scene, or be a fan of masterful  performance.  Or maybe you're in the mood for a send-up of a detective story gone completely awry.  I don't know.  But the film has appeal, no doubt about it, as anyone who has attended or seen pictures of a Lebowski Fest will attest. ( I'm still trying to convince my wife that a week of vacation spent at one these Fests is a worthwhile escapade.)  Whether I make it to a celebration of what-have-you or not, I've always got The Dude.  And I don't know about you, but I take a bit of comfort in that, knowing he's out there, taking it easy for all us sinners.  Aw, shucks.  I sure hope he makes the finals.  In my book, he's the champ, and has yet to be dethroned.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|As someone who hasn't seen the show, just bought the CD, I can only judge it by comparing it to other original cast albums. And no, it's not a South Pacific or My Fair Lady or Annie Get Your Gun or Gypsy, where virtually every song is a classic. But there's some good stuff here, and the leads are amazing - they make the good stuff great, and the OK stuff as good as it can be. I enjoy Idina Menzel's anthemic \\"Defying Gravity\\" - but I'd love to see it live, because it's hard to get the full sense of power from the CD. The duets, particularly \\"For Good\\", are excellent - very complementary voices. But I predict the classic from this CD will be \\"Popular\\". It's like an \\"Adelaide's Lament\\" for the 2000's, a song tailored to its star. Kristin Chenoweth turns it into a tour-de-force of comic inventiveness. Chenoweth has the vocal range and control of greats like Barbara Cook and Julie Andrews, and the comic brilliance of Judy Holliday and Vivian Blaine. It's an amazing combination. When you listen and hear what she does with the song, how she's able to sing, speak, bend words and notes just so, it's like a master class in musical comedy. Just listen to the part, when she says, \\"...don't make me laugh, they were popular, PLEASE, it's all about popular...\\" Every word is expressed just right. She must have added the \\"please\\" herself, a perfect touch. The recording is sheer genius, well worth repeated listens - it will make you laugh and smile and hum along. But just try singing it - that's when you'll realize how tough it is to pull this kind of song off. Buy the whole CD - it's good to have musical context - but it's worth the price of the CD just to have \\"Popular\\".
B00000G3PL|5.0|Its good to have the complete set in an organized manner.  Also it is less expensive than buying them individualy and they are of good quality.
B00003CXUM|4.0|I realize that there are a whole flock of folks out there who refuse to see a movie if it's in black & white.  Everything from vintage Chaplin to \\"Casablanca\\" to \\"Raging Bull\\" goes unseen by them because they're not in color.  In fact, I understand that a major reason why Peter Jackson remade \\"King Kong\\" is because many refuse to see the monochrome original.  These ignoramuses don't know what they're missing.      To the contrary, black & white cinematography is an utterly compelling way to convey the filmic image.  Like the visible brushstrokes in an Impressionist painting, black & white emphasizes the composition within the film's frame.  And although it puts the viewer at an arm's distance from the on-screen action -- black & white is not how most of us perceive the outside world -- it should not prevent us from becoming absorbed in a movie.  Black & white is cinema in all its primeval splendor.      I don't insist that every film I see be in black & white -- indeed, some of my favorite movies are in color -- but I'm sorry to see the monochromatic moving image vanishing from the big screen because there isn't an audience to support it.  Martin Scorsese originally wanted to shoot \\"The Color of Money\\" in black & white, but he was overruled by his producers.  When Brian De Palma had the same idea for \\"The Untouchables,\\" he met the same fate.  However, I think that some contemporary color movies would have been enhanced if done in black & white.      Which brings me to \\"In the Mood for Love,\\" a film in color.  Its director, Wong Kar-Wai, is one of my favorite filmmakers working today.  Furthermore, his movies would be unimaginable without the visual input of two longtime collaborators: production designer William Chang and cinematographer Christopher Doyle.  All of these gentlemen have my utmost respect, and I wouldn't want to second-guess any of their creative decisions.  Anyone who's experienced the whimsical whoosh of \\"Chungking Express\\" or the fish-eye introspection of \\"Fallen Angels\\" knows exactly what I'm talking about.      But ever since I bought \\"In the Mood for Love\\" on DVD, I've had the nagging thought that the film would look better in black & white.  Black & white would better evoke the film's setting of Hong Kong in the early 1960s, a time when infidelity was even more taboo than it is today.  Black & white would better capture the textures of the dilapidated city before its growth into a chrome-covered economic powerhouse.  Black & white would better convey the supression of love through its supression of color.  These thoughts crowded my mind every time I slid \\"In the Mood for Love\\" into the player.      Finally, I found the button on my TV set's remote that controlled the color, and I turned it all the way down.  Know what?  I was right!  \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is a better film in black & white.  All of my thoughts were confirmed.  There was something especially kinetic about seeing Maggie Cheung's luminous face emoting in a silvery monochrome.      Granted, \\"In the Mood for Love\\" was designed to be shot in color, and when viewed in black & white, the gray tones are particularly muddy in some scenes.  The faces don't \\"pop,\\" don't stand out in relief from the background, as they surely would have if they had been shot for the monochrome screen.  Also lost are the extravagant colors of Maggie's cheongsams (those form-fitting Chinese dresses), but their designs alone still pack a visual punch.  In fact, for a film shot in color, \\"In the Mood for Love\\" looks pretty darn good in black & white.      So, if you love black & white movies as much as I do, try watching \\"In the Mood for Love\\" on video with the color switched off.  See if you don't agree with me.  See if the film doesn't remind you of early-'60s Antonioni.  See if it doesn't better capture an era when women wore their hair above their necks and infatuation with another man's wife was a love that dare not speak its name.
B0002OERI0|1.0|green day is horrible band. the only thing they succeed at is repeating 4 chords over and over again and enslaving the minds of all who listen to them. This is an insult to bands who make real music, and don't just copy everyone else and call it original like green day. In case anyone didn't notice, american idiot sounds exactly like a lot of the songs on international superhits. boulevard of broken dreams and holiday are almost exactly the same, and the rest of the album doesn't deserve any of my attention at all, even for criticism. What possible reason could you have for listening to this when there are still amazing bands like the yardbirds, cream, led zeppelin and jimi hendrix that still haven't earned their share of popularity among modern america?
B0002S94OS|3.0|i cant lie, this is a good metal album. very aggresive and pissed off sounding, plus good instrumental work. a couple of things keep me from really liking this album though. <br /> <br />first off, there's randall blythe. the guys got a hell of a yell, but his constant \\"i hate bush, i hate republicans, i hate the government, i hate every desicion the USA has made about war\\" gets real old real fast. i love music. i dont love politics. to me it makes me not want to listen to an album as much when its got so much political stuff in it, regarless of what side its on. the instrumental track on the album was completely ruined for me, because its got that soldier guy from the gulf war talking about how US troops were ordered to slaughter all these innocent people and crap. maybe thats true, maybe its not, but i dont want to think about that sh*t when im listening to a metal album. i want to be thinking about the music, not about political views. of course, everybody has the right to express their own opinion, but i really wish bands like this would keep the politics seperate from the music. we'd all be better off. and all the whining about how our government is all corrupted and all that is just lame. period. just move to freakin europe if its really that bad, jeez... <br /> <br />that said, this isnt by any means a bad album. great guitar riffs, great drumming, great vocals and bass, but the songs on here just dont quite measure up to their last album, \\"as the palaces burn.\\" it just sounds like mark and willie tried way too hard to make things complicated and technical. while some of it is badass, some of it is really not neccesary. its like they tried to write stuff better than the last album, but in trying so hard they actually ended up with stuff thats not quite as good. its a little forced. also, there's no song on \\"ashes of the wake\\" that really strikes that deep chord within, like \\"11th hour\\" and \\"vigil\\" on the last album (although parts of \\"blood of the scribe\\" sound like a cheap version of \\"11th hour\\"). the songwriting is just not as good. <br /> <br />now, with that also said, people who are just looking for an all out heavy album to thrash about to will most likely love this album. its really heavy and has some great grooves. the best song has got to be the first track, \\"laid to rest.\\" this is the only song that i think compares to the stuff on \\"palaces.\\" all these guys have alot of ability on their instruments, although ability isnt everything. if you've never listened to LOG before, i suggest you start with \\"as the palaces burn,\\" and then pick this one up later.
B00068NVI4|3.0|Yeah, I thought maybe I had the wrong audio setting, but as I see from other reviews, this DVD is poorly mixed and/or recorded. Beautiful cinematography, and them balloons, although commented upon poorly in forums elsewhere, don't look bad with modern lighting techniques. Other than that, it is unfortunate to see such slowed down and  arthritic performances, dulled I guess by time or fatigue (Yessongs, although poorly recorded and subject to the technical vagaries of the day, has real balls to the wall performances). Many signature parts in songs are either flubbed or just dumbed down (re:Squire in \\"yours is no disgrace\\"). Acoustic set, which I was sure I'd hate, was actually pleasant. Very nice to have a full show over two discs.
B0009W5JS2|2.0|Three things....the acting sucked! the story line sucked! and the FX sucked! Ice monkey or Ice whatever...should stick with gansta movies and leave the action flix for the big dogs, dog! navy seal uh? right! why do all these guys have a ice type name?? ice cube, ice tea, vinilla ice....how about rectal itch for a rap name?? I rate this a 2 stars becuase it had good guns. HK, Sig, Colt M-16....
B00005LOLD|5.0|Sayonara follows Air Force officer Lloyd (Marlon Brando) who is conveniently transferred from Korea to Kobe, Japan in hopes that he will wed a Generals daughter. Being unsure of his feelings on marriage, Lloyd soon becomes attracted to a famous dancer named Hana Ogi (Miko Tanaka) who has issues of her own. The other sub plot in the film involves Lloyds friend Kelly (Red Buttons) who faces prejudice and bullying from his commanding officer for marrying his frowned upon Japanese wife Katsumi (Miyoshi Umeki). Both Buttons and Umeki won best supporting actor and actress Oscars for this film.      Yes the film, despite being a love story, spends a lot of time exploring racism against the Japanese. As some reviewers have pointed out, the Japanese were also very racist. That fact is only touched on in one scene where Mr. Nakamura (the only real Japanese man shown in the film and played interestingly enough by a very young Ricado Montalban) mentions that some of his own countrymen are not too terribly enthusiastic about international relationships. Granted, in a film which tries to juggle the beauty of Japan, racism and a love story, there is hardly time to explore the Japanese view point. One does wonder how Red Buttons wife's parents reacted to their daughter Katsumi marrying an American? Had Marlon Brando's love interest Hana Ogi's family lived surely they would not have been pleased with her giving up her famous career to marry a foreigner. Sadly none of these things are examined and may have been a flaw in a film trying to combat such a serious issue.       Mika Tanaka who portrays Brando's girlfriend was actually an American born into a wealthy Japanese family from Washington State. That's why her command of English is so good. Her character of Hana Ogi is a famous dancer in the Matsubayashi Girls dancing troupe. She explains to Brando in one heartfelt scene that she owes her life to the troupe and that her responsibility is to grow old and become a teacher for futuredancers.  There were no actual \\"Matsubayashi Girls\\" but the film invents the troupe as a serious, harshly governed, traditional group of girls who ironically perform Las Vegas style shows.Such dancers doing modern style dances for American G.I.'s were no doubt plentiful in post war Japan. However these girls came from a much less structured and governed group unlike the film would have you believe. In other words, the Geisha didn't go running off and put on tap shoes. The film's credits list the Matsubayahi girls as played by the Shochiku Comany dancers. Shochiku is still a well known movie company today but their days of promoting dancers, if in fact they ever did, are long since gone. I have reason to suspect that they were created just for this film.      The film is shot in Itami City,Kyoto,  Kobe, Osaka, Ise and Tokyo. One of my favorite scenes is Marlon Brando on the beach in Ise, admiring the \\"wedding rocks\\" while James Garner waits behind him in a jeep.........a good 100 km away in Arashiyama!    Most modern Japanese have never heard of the film Sayonara. The small group of Japanese adults that I know who did watch this film to were surprised and embarrassed by the level of servitude that Katsumi gave to Red Buttons. They also laughed at the fact that most of the Japanese women in the film adopted a very flat accent which was very typical of old T.V. dramas at the time.Like many movies of their time shot in Japan, Americans are portrayed with the \\"how could anyone not love us\\"? attitude.    The original 1957 movie program (Japanese) does mention that there was another ending to the film or rather, the ending was left out. In Japan, it seems, the last 5 minutes of the film wasn't shown in Japan. Weather it was cut, or another scene was shot later for American audiences, the program doesn't say. If there are other versions, they weren't shown in Japan.    One final note, which is probably THE SADDEST of all concerns Miyoshi Umeki who won a best supporting actress for this film.  She started her career as a singer and changed her name briefly to Nancy Umeki before being hired for Sayonara.  After winning the Oscar, she moved to the U.S.  and did many bit parts in movies and t.v. Most people might remember her in the U.S. playing Mrs. Livingston opposite Bill Bixby in the short lived T.V. drama \\"The Courtship of Eddies Father\\". Despite being the first Asian and the first Japanese to win an Oscar, she is virtually unknown in Japan. One would think that in Japan they would celebrate such an honored person but sadly the old generation barely remembers her and the new one has never heard of her. Oscar shows in Japan, at lest the last 10 years that I have watched, have never mentioned her. Miyoshi died in August of 2007 and there was very little about her death in Japan.
006028577X|3.0|Even though you wouldn't know it from the information shown above, this is an abridged adaptation, apparently prepared for young children.  Which is fine if that's what you want.  The illustrations are first rate and the quality of the book is excellent.  However, if what you want is a graphic representation of Victorian London, rather than the screenplay for \\"Mr McGoo's Christmas Carol\\", then look elsewhere.
B0009NCQJ6|1.0|Horrible, horrible tripe that gives classical music, string quartets, and beautiful women a bad name. The music is shrill, cheesy, \\"ethnic\\" techno with some strings thrown on top. These women have allowed record company men to put their talents to use for evil.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|If you have ever heard David Sedaris channel Billie Holiday, do not buy this album.  All I can think of when I listen to it is him singing \\"My bologna has a first name ....\\" in his Billie Holiday voice ... you can't help but laugh. There's no room left to appreciate Madeleine, unfortunately.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a wonderful set!!  And getting the three episodes that were not aired is a fantastic bonus.  Thanks so much for carrying it.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|This isn't an awful album, but in my opinion, it could have been better. Perhaps it's because they had an album that came out just a year before this (which was excellent, if for nothing, Stream of Conciousness is amazing). I picked this up the day it came out hoping for some sort of continuation of Train of Thought but inside got this lackluster album. <br /> <br />By no means it's awful, but it just doesn't seem to have the same \\"oomph\\" the other albums had. I'd say the best songs are These Walls, Panic Attack, Never Enough, and Octavarium. I Walk Besides You is the weirdest and possibly most experimental song I've heard them do because it seems like they decided to abandon their roots (if they have any specific roots, that is) and adopt the \\"emo\\" style.  <br /> <br />One interesting thing to note is some of the lyrics in Octavarium are from many other classic rock songs. (Ex. \\"Hey hey, my my\\" is from a Neil Young song) which I thought was very excellent. I recall listening to the song not expecting much, and then that came in and captured my interest. When you listen to this song - I feel it's best to think of Pink Floyd but if they were a metal band. (The opening is very remisicent of Echoes.) <br /> <br />The breakdown: It's good, but it seems like it's not their best effort. I think having a new album each year is a bit too much.
1402545355|5.0|A fun, well written book - I purchased the audio on CD and  <br />the reader made the story more enjoyable <br />
B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp was fantastic in this movie!  Easily the best drug-related movie I've ever seen.  The fact that it's a true story, makes it even that much better! If you haven't seen this movie yet, rent it as soon as possible, you'll love it!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|If you like standards, this is great easy listening. I have recommended it to friends and listened to it often on car trips.

B00030590I|2.0|A nameless warrior (Jet Li arrives at an emperor's palace with three weapons, each belonging to a famous assassin who had sworn to kill the emperor. As the nameless man spins out his story--and the emperor presents his own interpretation of what might really have happened ,each episode is drenched in red, blue, white or another dominant color. Hero combines great fighting scenes to many dry scenes.I can't even say I liked this movie.It was terrible.Even w/ Quentin putting some work into this movie it still isn't worth watching ,buying or even renting.I wouldn't by this movie at a flea market.
B000000H3Z|5.0|From South of the Border comes Sepultura. Yet they still manage not to sound like a knock-off, cheap version of an American thrash band.  <br /> <br />The savagely satanic (and completely hilarious and indesipherable) lyrics of earlier albums are gone here. I believe Max was beginning to learn some English, although still not very well. Nevertheless the English is still millions of light years above bands like Burzum and Mayhem.  <br /> <br />Every song shreds with bestial intensity. There's nothing even remotely stereotypical about this album. In fact, being from Brazil sort of gives this CD a cool, Amazonian, cannibal vibe, which is rare in metal. I can definetely imagine feasting on human flesh, while listening to this CD.  <br /> <br />Still, Max's English sucks, especially in that punk, wack, goofy band, Soulfly, that he's in now. Face it. That band su.ks compared to this stuff. No rap or stupid lyrics about Latin machismo on this Beneath the Remains unlike Soulfly, which obviously s.cks Fred Durst's buttc.ack.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|Kung Fu Hustle is a good movie.It's very creative and comparable to a superhero movie.Some actors in the movie hold powerful martial art skills.It adds great comedy that's very orignal and even includes dances on a couple scenes.All I have to say is I liked it , good effects \\"for the most part\\" and entertaining to watch.  If you like Kung Fu movies then pick up or rent Ong-Bak :The Thai Warrior\\".
6301773551|5.0|Make no mistake!  We're talking about the original version of STAR WARS as it was realeased on video \\"one last time\\" in 1995.  Black and blue box with Darth Vader on the cover. <br /> <br />While the special edition in 1997 was entertaining, it was in no way an improvement for STAR WARS purists, like myself.  The video I'm describing is the original 1977 film before George Lucas started butchering it and it has the benefit of being remastered in THX. <br /> <br />I'm not saying don't own the special edition DVD.  Of course own it!  It looks and sounds perfect!  I'm saying own BOTH! <br /> <br />By the way, everything I've said I also holds true for the 1995 video release of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, as well.  Between the original film and the 2004 DVD release, this film got butchered the most.  The insertion of Ian McDermid into the scene between Darth Vader and the Emperor was beyond shameful! <br /> <br />I can only hope Lucas will one day get the message from his fans and release the original (3) films on DVD.

0753506483|5.0|Warning: Don't get carried away by the title of this book, it is purely metaphoric. <br /> <br />When you are handed a 600 page autobiography of an entrepreneur, at first, you may wonder whether such a piece is worth even leafing through. Who has the time to read stuff like this?  <br /> <br />LOSING MY VIRGINITY is an extraordinary book written by an extraordinary man, Richard Branson. One may actually have some reservations about reading about a not exactly well-known business magnate (I am talking about India, of course). But rest assured, once you read through the author's bio and the very impressive blurbs, you will realize that it is far from a conventional (boring, if you like) memoir. <br /> <br />Branson is one of a rare breed, a paragon of British entrepreneurship, and a genius who has revolutionized British culture and lifestyles. Throughout this book, one can find a real humility in Branson's narrative of himself and his experiences. Like most contemporary memoirists, Branson uses the confessional mode of writing, which has allowed him to do things that a conventional novel will not. Branson's style of writing is so good-humored and his perceptions so remarkable that this book is worth a read even if you don't have the slightest interest in business. As one critic wrote about this book - Heavy but impossible to put down. <br /> <br />The book is written in a chronological fashion, and the chapters have rather stimulating titles. The chapters are actual chunks taken from Branson's life, and provide a rich visual and verbal experience to the reader. Some 130 photographs (both color and black & white) are there, and they complement the narrative beautifully. <br /> <br />It is fast paced, and has an honesty which is a little trivial at times. Branson reveals much about himself. Towards the middle, he gives a passionate account of his devotion towards music. His other great passion, adventure (some of which have been near-death experiences), is also dealt with in detail. Branson's love for ballooning, which he calls the most exhilarating of all sports, got him an entry into the Guinness Book of World Records, a real tribute to his daredevilry. <br /> <br />Branson's tale is novel, and is filled with instances of courage, the courage to break away from tradition. At age 16, Branson started a student's magazine and then ventured into music, which was a big hit. Richard Branson recounts this as a sad moment in his life when he had to sell Virgin Records to Thorn EMI in order to keep a floundering Virgin Atlantic Airways afloat. Today, apart from Virgin Atlantic, the Virgin Group owns Virgin Cola, Virgin Vie, Virgin Brides, Virgin Mega-stores and many more such ventures, which cater to everything any person would want in his daily life.  Now, after conquering the world, he wants to fly you to space.  <br /> <br />I would hate to spoil the read for you, so suffice it to say that LOSING MY VIRGINITY is a real, inspirational story that can only be told by the man himself.  Such is the popularity of this book that it has become a byword for 'What they don't teach you at Business Schools'. From another perspective, it is a comic recollection of life's ups and downs juxtaposed with anecdotes about rock stars, politicians, friends and foes. <br /> <br />One finds no moral story in the end, no grandfatherly advice to the young blood. Instead, one is left with a deep feeling of admiration and a constant mulling over his adventures. If you ever want to know how much a single guy can achieve with \\"talent, initiative and good ideas\\", read this book. It comes as close to providing the real experience as any book can, and for this reason alone it should be coveted.
B000957O82|4.0|Will Smith is the \\"Date Doctor\\", a man who knows everything about coaching other people towards romance.  He knows all of the angles and he shares them with male clients who are in love and feel that the object of their affection is out of their reach.  His main client is a klutzy accountant, played by Kevin James, who is in love with a wealthy divorcee.  Meanwhile Smith is using all of his romantic ploys to win over a gossip columnist, played by Eva Mendes.  It's a tossup as to who is the most leery about relationships, Smith or Mendes.  Each has been hurt before and each will do whatever it takes to avoid any further hurt.  This movie is full of laughs and, although the end is predictable, getting there is lots of fun.
B0007GAERG|2.0|With the exception of \\"We Belong Together (which sounds exactly like Usher's Confessions Part II),\\" \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Circles\\" this album is a joke... Mariah, who has an excellent voice, limits herself to \\"breathy\\" and \\"light\\" talking on many tracks like \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"It's Like That.\\"  She has let rappers take over her production, and as a fan of rap, I still think it ruins her true potential. I can't stand hearing Jermaine Dupri talking and laughing behind her in quite a few cuts on the record, namly \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"Shake It Off.\\"  It is incredibly annoying.  The track with Pharrell from the Neptunes sounds like the soundtrack to a video game.  The high pitched chorus by Jermaine Dupri on \\"Get Your Number\\" demonstrates that he is trying to sound like Nelly.  His high pitched chant makes my ears cringe.  Of course, the album is selling by the millions and tearing up the charts fueled by the hit single \\"We Belong Together\\" so I guess people think it's good because it's selling.  Well, just because it is popular doesn't mean it's good.
0800141660|5.0|Together with the 1995 Ehle-Firth Pride and Prejudice, this is the finest film version of an Austen novel. Thompson's script is marvelous and her perfomance is very moving.  All of the acting is compelling.  The interesting result is that the movie seems to have more depth and emotional power than the novel itself.  A must-see for Austen (or Thompson) fans.

0783231202|5.0|This movie was vastly underrated when it was released.  It was one of the best films of 1997, and the incredible Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances. Anchored by sensitive performances by two great actors, Freeman and Anthony Hopkins, it is one of Spielburg's best films.  Amistad is a powerful film without seeming false or manipulative in any way. The film may not be completely historically accurate, but it is an important film.  The scenes where some of the slaves are thrown overboard the ship to lighten the load are very difficult to watch and are inappropriate for children. Otherwise, it is a good film for parents to watch and discuss with older children.

B000244FDW|3.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice is not good at all, except for its portrayal of Mrs. Bennett.  If you love, love, love Jane Austen, you'll probably want to at least watch all filmed versions of Pride and Prejudice.  But the A&E version is so wonderful that it is addictive and you'll want to watch it over and over.  So, buy that one.  This version is quite dull.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Wow..what a movie! I had no idea what to expect when I saw this DVD. I had heard the reviews but I was hesitant to see a movie with subtitles that seemed to be filled with Kung-Fu images I didn't really know much about. Well, I was mistaken. What a riot and what a great, great story. Part broadway show, part action spoof, part art-house cinematic genius, this movie is great on so many levels. The story itself is a winner and even when the fight sequences go on a tad too long, stick with it because the payback is awesome. You'll howl at the \\"axe-gang\\" thugs and marvel at the digital and real life stunts that are shown. I actually think the subtitles added to the movie's humor and they were not bothersome at all. The ending was priceless.  <br />Watch the gag reel at the end. Bloopers are bloopers in any language.
B00005MP58|5.0|Together with Emma Thompson's wonderful \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", this is the best film version of an Austen novel.  Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are absolutely perfect in every way as Elizabeth Bennett and Mark Darcy.  This is six hours long, but so addictive that Austen fans will be grateful for every second.  Don't bother with other versions.  Hollywood's 1940 version is ghastly, just like nails on a chalkboard to Austen fans, although the Mr. Bennett isn't too bad in that.  The 1980's PBS version isn't good, but, fortunately, very forgettable.  The only strong point of that version is the depiction of Mrs. Bennett, presenting her in a kindly and realistic light.  But this Ehle-Firth version is a must for Austen fans, or any fan of romantic movies.
1932100385|1.0|This is a sad case of a prominent vegan author who \\"cooked\\" statistics to serve his cause.  You absolutely must read the reviews that have been buried way below, notably the ones by Kaayla T.

0446604844|3.0|Maybe our expectations were set a little high after reading the author's great thriller \\"Absolute Power\\" and his almost as good \\"Simple Truth\\".  Unlike those stories where at least we cared about the protagonists and the plot had some cohesion, \\"Control\\" takes a awful long time to plod toward a thrilling finale.  Unfortunately the events that unfold to get us there are extremely far-fetched, with the allegedly intelligent leading lady super-lawyer, Sidney Archer, little more than a gun-totin' housewife with hardly a clue throughout the whole tale.<br /><br />The plot sounds like movie pabulum:  a zillionaire tycoon has merged with a techno-geek's dream-works, and now they're in a competition to take over another firm of great internet marvel.  Sidney, and hubby Jason, a technocrat putting together a lot of details to support the deal, get caught up in the struggle, and soon a plane crash leads the players (but not us readers, who know he's up to something seemingly sinister) to believe Jason was among the fatalities.  What follows is an almost endless \\"chase\\" between all variety of petty thugs, hired killers, ex-FBI and FBI type hotdogs, with a wealth of dead bodies strewn about by book's end.  Flying planes and driving cars in snowstorms too severe to shut the airports and roads pose no problem for our stars, typical of the silly suspensions of reality we must endure to get through this.<br /><br />We know Baldacci can do better from his other novels.  This book looks like something written on contract:  it had to get out; it had to be 700 chilling pages; it had to have non-stop action no matter how preposterous.  Oh, and don't waste time fleshing out the characters to make them seem real - after all, this is a fantasy.  When it takes us two weeks to get through a \\"thriller\\", we know something's wrong.
0060763280|1.0|Eker has written the book to promote his seminars.  The book is useless as it is void of any strategies to be used by the reader.  It is full of generalities and anecdotes that sound cheap and rudimentary. <br />Hank
1400032717|3.0|I was impressed by this book, and as a teacher I have worked with several autistic children.  I appreciated the straight forward way it was written and really felt like I have \\"known\\" Christopher, through my experiences with other children.  Although I enjoyed the book, it was not \\"the best.\\"  I guess I was looking for more in the ending, and yet given the circumstance (Christopher's autistic tendancies) it was entirely appropriate.  Maybe I was in the mood for something more dramatic.  I have a friend that was not at all impressed by it, but has never really known anyone with autism.  I think it's more relative if you have known an autistic child/teen.

0743454529|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and appreciated the fact that it  was told from several points of view.  It is an interesting topic (designer babies) and I was surprised at how I felt about it at different times during the book.  It brought up several issues that I had never considered, and nicely portrayed what a strain cancer can put on an entire family.  I often found myself thinking \\"what would you do in a situation like this?\\"  It got a bit dramatic at the end, but it also made for a nice twist.  Make sure as you get close to the end to have a box of tissues handy.  This book is the first I have read from Picoult, but I am very interested to read more now.

B00004TWZF|4.0|I must rate this film as one of my absolute favorites of all time. I first saw the US version though, and with the wonderful music by Bill Conti. <br /> <br />I can't say that the Eric Serra score is good for the film. Perhaps good music on its own, but my chief complaint is that Serra's score doesn't match the style and pacing of the film at all. There's music when there shouldn't be any, and rather calm and boring segments when there should be some fast paced or other music. I bring chief attention to Mayol's first dive sequence,,,the build-up of Conti's music is exhilirating, and the way he captures the pure spirit of Mayol's ascent from the dive is total magic, capturing the essence of victory as Mayol breaches the water with the indicator tab showing 360 feet. <br />Alas, I am still searching the Internet for the Conti version of the soundtrack... <br /> <br />As for the extended/deleted scenes that never found their way into the US version, but ARE featured in this DVD, I wish they had been, but the US version of the movie really isn't lacking because of it. Most of the scenes are rather 'European' in flavor and sport a humor and style that are decidedly corny and kinda take away from the overall spirit of the film, in addition to making it longer than necessary. Something that Europe is still figuring out in their filmmaking. They can take a very serious movie and turn it into a horrendous flop by trying to introduce European film humor into it. The US editors knew what they were doing... <br /> <br />Ultimately, this movie is well worth purchasing, because seeing the widescreen images and having the long lasting DVD will ensure years of viewing pleasure.  <br />

0385510454|2.0|Reading the back of the latest John Grisham novel, the Broker, it sets itself up as a typical Grisham story.  An intriguing story with some chases and some thrills and an exciting ending.  Well, this story took a different route. <br /> <br />Joel Backman, the Broker, is in jail.  He has been in jail for years.  He is suprisingly pardoned and you think that the action is going to heat up.  It doesn't.  Backman is rushed off to Italy by the CIA in hopes that the CIA may learn who is trying to kill Backman.  Is it the Saudis?  Is it Israel?  Is it China?  Well, it appears that the CIA was trying to kill him with the Italian language and long walks because that is all we read about for oh, 300 pages.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoy development of a character.  I enjoy development of a city or a situation.  But Grisham seemed to decide that he would give us a rather uninteresting novel of unintrigue.   <br /> <br />I think that the reason that it bothered me a little is that this story had a lot of potential.  It could have been handled well and I didn't feel Grisham did that.  He set up the various foreign assassins throughout the book...but not much else.   <br /> <br />The ending was above par for this book...but it still was rather anticlimatic.  I really believe that if it was any other author's name on the title of this book, The Broker would have faded quickly into obscurity.  <br /> <br />Now with all that said, I still liked the basic premise of the book.  The Broker could have been a very strong character.  The characters could have been strong in their supportive roles.  But they were not.  The story lagged.  Grisham kept so much information away from the reader throughout the book that you lost interest into why Backman was on the run in the first place.  Strange and disappointing.
B000001FS3|5.0|Just a quick note that Brian Eno is in no small part responsible for the amazing textures and soundscapes that this album holds.  He adopted U2 for awhile, and, along with Daniel Lanois, Eno used them to flesh out his ideas, much as he did with Talking Heads and Bowie before them.   <br /> <br />Also, to 'Cappndave', this album came out in Spring of '86.  It doesn't belong on anybody's best of 90s list.  Instead it represents some of the best of the surfacing of 'college rock'-type music into mainstream in the mid 80s.   <br /> <br />To all you kids who like to retro the 80s as goofy, there was alot of sincerity and quality that went on back then for those who were interested. Better than the cynical, ironic 90s that followed.
B000059QYB|5.0|Energy-raising life force Bill Idol reaches nuclear heights on this, his best album.  It seems that only yesterday Idol spellbound a nation with his hit anthem \\"Rock the Cradle.\\"  When that song came out, the nation was used to sludgy Metallica riffs or shiny hairbands.  Bill Idol wasn't about that trash.  This guy was a lean, mean, fightin' machine who took no prisoners and never bothered to ask preguntas at a later date. <br /> <br />The music on this CD is simply stalwart, the rock of ages.  Idol's hang-tite \\"Rebel Yell\\" voice is ever-present, and the guitar chops on this record CD busted serious ground.  What was best about Bill Idol was his maniac dance moves and facial expressions on stage.  This guy was every bit the rock + roll entertainer - just check out his old '80s vids!!!!! <br /> <br />In conclusion, Bill Idol took the r + r world by storm in the '80s and never looked over his shoulder.  He also took no prisoners!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Check 'im out!!!!!!!!!!
B000002JR8|5.0|Hoo-whee! Metal don't get much better than this, kiddies... crushing riffs, bludgeoning rythym and Phil Anselmo's heavy-but-often-soulful vocals make for the ultimate adrenaline rush, packed up neatly in a little package called \\"Far Beyond Driven\\". It's like a hundred energy drinks in a row. <br /> <br />In '92, Pantera unleashed the almighty \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\" on the nation, and it debuted at #1! So you'd think, would Pantera mellow out? Three seconds into \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" is enough to etch the word \\"NO\\" into your brain. My favorite on the album, and possibly in Pantera's entire catalogue, \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\" starts off INSANE, then goes to a brutal breakdown in the middle, with Phil shouting his vitriol against the superficial America, declaring him and the rest of Pantera to be \\"STRONGER THAN ALL!!\\" Amen, Pantera. This song will BLOW YOU AWAY, so crank that mother up! <br /> <br />Other killer songs include the self-empowering \\"Becoming\\" (awesome bass drum work by Vinnie), the mosher \\"Five Minutes Alone\\", the kinda bluesy riffing of \\"I'm Broken\\", the almost industrial-ish, sort of novelty \\"Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills\\", the fast-as-all-hell \\"Use My Third Arm\\", the shredding \\"25 Years\\", and the cooldown end track, a great cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\". The other songs kick, too. <br /> <br />I'm gonna go back to that \\"self-empowering\\" statement for a bit. One thing that makes me sick about 2005 America is the emo trend. Why? Besides the music being too watered-down and whiny, it encourages kids with problems to just sit there, and cry and wallow in self-pity forever. Pantera, especially in this album, says \\"F**K THAT!\\" The songs on here, \\"Becoming\\" most of all, encourage self-empowerment, to not sit back and take crap, to stand up and take charge! I somehow doubt Taking Back Sunday will be including that theme in their next album... <br /> <br />Want awesome metal that packs a serious punch? \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is just what the doctor ordered. <br /> <br />\\"HAIL KINGS! THE NEW KINGS! STRONGER THAN ALL!!!!\\"
B000001ESP|5.0|When I hear the classicism-type rock that IS Rush, I am always reminded of one popular saying: <br /> <br />\\"It's all good.\\" <br /> <br />Yep, that's right.  Life is all types of good when you're jammin' out to my boys in Rush.  This all-or-nothing record captures the band at the peak of their hits - and their height!!! <br /> <br />As far as instrumentation, this is one of the top bands of the '60s, '70s and '80s.  Save for the reckless drummer, who isn't much of a musician, the guys in Rush are some of the most original, hardworking rock-n-rollers to ever hit MTV!!!!!! <br /> <br />Also, you gots to dig the singer of this band.  The dude sounds like a pibsqueak and even talks with a squeaky voice, but his pitch breaks glass and his attitude is right on par with the lead singer of Supertramp and the brunette chick from Heart!!!!  Way cool!!!! <br /> <br />So what else?  Well, they just don't make bands like Rush these days.  The closest thing would be Led Zeppelin or Pearl Jam, but those bands lack the mysticism and radio hits of bad-boy band Rush.  If you're looking for juke box fun on a Saturday night, look no further than the Rushmeisters. <br /> <br />Speaking of coolness, where has David Lee Roth been lately?  Is he finished with his training as a paramedic?  Lord help us!!!!!!!!!!
B000060K4O|5.0|...that makes me feel good inside every time I watch it. The acting is especially appealing -and Murray as \\"doctor\\" Peter Venkman is my personal all-time-favorite among characters of comedy. He's just so relaxed, and doesn't let anything bother him, and he doesn't take much serious. This is probably one of my favorite Murray-comedies -in the amazingly effective company of Dan Akroyd and the rest of the cast. <br /> <br />Some of the effects are still stunning today, and those that would have been much more \\"put to reality\\" with the technology they use today -well, let's just say that it has its' charm actually -this being that \\"Ghostbusters\\" once was a breakthrough for special effects, and in comparasism to other movies of its' time it is easy to see that this was a big-budget movie, and one of such qualities that it is also a really fun story. <br /> <br />One of my favorites from the eighties, I bought this with its' sequel and I watch them over and over again. Highly recommended!
B000055Y0X|5.0|\\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is Stanley Kubrick's wonderful black comedy look at the nuclear arms race between the UNited States and Russia in the 1960s.  The film is loosely based off of a much more serious novel, entitled \\"Red Alert\\" and the film was actually intended to be of a serious nature; when Kubrick apparently had a sudden change of heart---thank God!!    THis film is fabulous!    The film starts with General Ripper ordering his guard bombers to prepare for an attack against Soviet targets in a retaliation strike.  Problem is, there was no Soviet attack for which they would be retaliating to.  Ripper didn't care, because he was so wound up in all of the communist propaganda, that he felt he needed to take matters into his own hands.  His character is one of the funniest characters I have seen in a movie, due to his completly insane ramblings.  My favorite of his rants is when he goes on about how the flouridation of water is a communist idea that has infiltrated the United States.  He looks squarley and very seriously to his executive office \\"Mandrake\\"(one of 3 characters played by Peter Sellers)eyes and tell him that they are flouridating such items as salt, soup, soda, etc....\\"even ice cream.  Yes, little children's ice cream.\\"  I rarely laugh out loud when watching a film alone, but just couldn't help myself during this scene.  The way in which he looks at Sellers and the expression Sellers gives is just priceless.      Speaking of Sellers, he plays 3 roles in the film and certainly mastered all of them.  My favorite is his role as the president.  This is probably the most serious character in the film.  He is the only character who seems to have any kind of a grip on what the repercussions of the un-authorized retaliation attack will have on both the United States and the world; and, is the only character who is dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to stop the attack.  But, the conversations he engages in are really funny.  The best of which are his dialogueson the telephone with the Russian ambassador.  The first time they speak on the phone the ambassador is drunk and apparently scolds the president for not calling simply to say \\"hello\\".  Then, in a later conversation, we hear him try to explain to the Russian ambassador that he is just as sorry as the ambassador is that the attacks may be too far along to stop.    Sellers' final character is the title role of Dr. Strangelove, a German arms scientist, hired by the United States as a consultant of sorts.  He is a truly evil and sinister man, who is confined to a wheelchair.  Strangelove confirms to the members of the war room that the United States has secretly created a device known as the \\"Doomsday Device\\" that will destroy the world and activate on it's own at the slightest hint of a nuclear war breakout.  Hence the reason the the president is so sorry that the retaliation attack cannot be stopped.  Strangelove does concoct a plan at the end, which is really where I understood how intelligent this film was.  I will leave that \\"building of a society\\" plan for you viewers to watch and interpret on your own; but it really is creepy to think that in a time of war or apocalypse, people of this mindset may actually be influential.    George C. Scott plays the \\"over the top\\" role of General Turdison.  HIs character is very child-like and VERY paranoid about the communist reign.  He provides comedy in every scene he is a part of and really exchanges well on screen with Peter Sellers.  His character is also the most familiar with the \\"destination\\" of the retaliation attack.    The only other notable characters in the film are \\"Kong\\", played by Slim Pickens.  He is the pilot of the bomber plane headed to destroy a missle site in Russian.  We also see a very young James Earl Jones as a bombedier in the same plane.    Folks, this movie is wonderfully funny and amazingly relevant even in this era of filmmaking.  The themes still hold true to our society today and the comedy anddialogue in this film are absolutly masterful.      On a quick side note, I found it very interesting that one of the themes of the film is a trouble with basic communication.  Right from the very beginning when Ripper is asking his officer if he recognizes his voice all the way to the near end, when Office Mandrake is having trouble gettnig thru on the pay phone to the president, our characters have to deal with some sort of problem with communication.  General Ripper phones Turdison in the beginning and has to relay his message thru Turdison's secretary, because Turdison is on the toilet.  The president has difficuly understand the Russian ambassador in their first conversation, first because the signal is faded and the background music is loud; and, then because the ambassador is drunk.  And, throughout the whole film, the most obvious is the fact that nobody can reach any of the bomber planes that are on teir way to Russia, because part of the attack's plans called for all communication ties to be cut, in fear of international signal crossing.  There are many more examples---just something for the hardcore fans to look for next time.    Hey folks, this is worth much more than a rent--just buy it...you're probably going to end up doing so anyway!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Sarah McLachlan has been producing the same kind of music and singing about the same themes of love and heartbreak from the very beginning-that makes 15 years, counting from the release of Touch in 1989. Shouldn't we be tired of it by now? We should be ushering the ethereal singer-songwriter into a graceful retirement by forgetting. We should be yawning every time a same-y new single comes out. We should be annoyed that she's still around. Shoulda, woulda, coulda. But no.<br /><br />Everything tells me that I shouldn't like Afterglow, because I've heard it all before. But McLachlan is simply very, very good at what she does, so if all of the album's ten tracks are in the classic McLachlan mold-lush, melodic piano-based songs with sensitive lyrics and an even more sensitive vocal delivery-well, then, it's (still) some of the most perfect sensitive, melodic piano-based songs ever produced.<br /><br />Sure, Afterglow takes up where Surfacing left off seven years ago. There's hardly any musical progress from that last studio album, which may disappoint listeners hoping for her to come out from her long hiatus with something new to show for it, but it feels like it's missing the point to ask for novelty in the face of such gorgeous songs. There's the weary \\"Time,\\" which shows off McLachlan's unparalleled ear for melody, so that even when she sings, \\"So leave me be, I don't want to argue, I just get confused and I come all undone/ If I agree, well, it's just to appease you, because I don't remember what we're fighting for,\\" her lovely, expressive voice gets to soar under all that weight. I don't remember such tiredness sounding so sincere and so alluring at the same time.<br /><br />The standout songs are only excellent tracks in an album of overall good quality. There's \\"Fallen,\\" a song about the failure of a relationship from the point of view of the one at fault; the almost angry \\"Stupid,\\" about falling deeply in love for the wrong person; \\"Train Wreck,\\" which alternately begs for and celebrates love; \\"Dirty Little Secret,\\" about the regret at the end of a good relationship. All of them are built on McLachlan's beautiful voice, on lush but surprisingly light melodies, on lyrics that are poetic without being sappy. All variations on one theme, yes, and any of them sound like they'd fit neatly in any of the McLachlan's past albums. But those sound like small quibbles in the face of McLachlan's solid songwriting and moving delivery.<br /><br />Sarah McLachlan's career is a study in achievement. From early success at age 21, she's produced a series of strong albums and become the quintessential female singer-songwriter icon. It sounds like she's found her niche by producing consistent and consistently good work. While performers like Madonna or even Tori Amos feel comfortable in the flux of continually reinventing themselves and their music, artistic progress surely doesn't mean just that. Do you really want to fault Sarah McLachlan for feeling comfortable in her own skin, or penalize her for continuing to create some very good music that just happens to be in the same vein? Listen to the ten fine songs in Afterglow, and tell me if you still feel like complaining.ternately begs for and celebrates love; \\"Dirty Little Secret,\\" about the regret at the end of a good relationship.

0446310786|5.0|How can you pass this book, by any stretch of the immagination? This books gives history a whole new definition. It was required reading for me in my Freshman Year. Usually, I would detest an book I was made to read in school, and this was my mindset as I began into the book. I thought, since it is a classic, it would be painstaking and difficult to understand and to read. I was wrong. By the time I was finished with each chapter, I found myself wondering what wou;d happen next. How could these awful things be similair to true historical events? It wasn't fair, and it really forsed me to think and use my head. I put myself in seperate perspectives, thought about the changes that have been made to our beloved America since, and how anyone could ever be so hateful and unjust. I have to say, I was entirely taken aback with Harper Lee's words, and am very impressed with this work of art.
B000002U82|5.0|(I'm not going to review this album in song by song detail, but if you want to hear about a great album from a true Floydian, well, here you go) Wow. I'd known of Pink Floyd for years, my father played it in the car, around the house, everywhere, but I never truly appreciated the music until The Pink Floyd Laser Spectacular came into town a few years ago. I've figured out why they never really appealed to me, and all I can say is that Pink Floyd is an acquired taste. Sure, there's songs like Money and another Brick in the Wall that have become so commercialized that everybody knows them for one reason or another, but there are those few needles in the haystack that just pop out to you. I'd never been able to say that I'd had one favorite song for more than a couple months at a time before listening to Time, but now I'm proud to say that anytime somebody asks what my favorite song is, it's amazingly easy to tell them. If you have any doubts about this album, just try sitting there and listening to it without driving in the car, or looking at something on the internet, whatever. Maybe the guitar isn't that difficult to play, or the vocals aren't the best, but the genius it takes to execute these elements is mindblowing. All the stuff that's on the radio today is too fake and whiny for my taste(try listening to rap or pop or something like that and tell me I'm wrong). The words in those songs are not genuine. Nobody puts real thoughts that everday, normal people have into song like Pink Floyd.

He want's Charles's young trophy wife and more importantly, he wants Charles's vast fortune.  <br /> <br />When their plane goes down in the Alaskan wilderness you think that Bob, the younger man has the advantage. He doesn't. Charles, thanks to his brain and his reading is far more fit and useful on this nightmare trip.  <br /> <br />He's the one who remembers how to make a fishing lure, he's the one who remembers how to make a compass and he's the one who is bold enough to try kill the bear. Charles actually seems to bloom as the survival story moves along and when he figures out what's been going on between his wife and Bob his reaction wins the audience completely to his side.  <br /> <br />The scenary is beautiful, Bart the Bear made me hope once again to never, ever see a bear that close up and the ending was perfect.
B000021YQV|4.0|The second album SOAD is a definite sucess. It has really depicted rock, and shapen a new generation of todays music. They really are a different style, sorta like opera rock. They stand their own ground, and are sometimes very serious in some of their lyrics. Anyway, Toxicity definitely has some highs and lows, but it succeeds in all ways. Song by song review below:    Prison Song 9/10. \\"Trying to build a prison,\\" is kind of the main idea in this song. Typical SOAD song with tons of head bobbing rock to listen to. Solid and strict opener, great drumming, heavy guitar, and probably has the most clear sense of meaning on the CD, unless you listen to Bounce. The verses are quick, and I love at the end of them, Serj is explaining what is going on with the prison system.    Needles 9/10. The follow up doesn't sound like a real SOAD song, as some people have pointed out. The lyrics are kind of confusing, but its enjoyable. I've gave it a few more listens, and now I enjoy it a little more. Love the verses cause it is something you feel that takes no skill on the drums, but then it explodes, so no worries.      Deer Dance 9/10. Now that I listened to it a little more i like it a lot more. It took a while to get into. Really heavy and bouncy. Still gives me the same feeling about Needles. Intro is very heavy, and screaming chorus about children and applying them with guns. I love the melodic veses because it sounds really calm in a way, compared to the chorus, and the guitar riffs are awesome.     Jet Pilot 6/10. NOTHING but noise and screaming. It sounds like a total tripped out song. The lyrics make no sense, and its just a filler. Its obviously got some symbolism, because it replaces a person with a horse, which is beyond my belief, so just hit the skip button on this track. This is where the album heads downhill. The chorus sticks in your head if you listen to it a lot, which I doubt you will.    X 7/10. What do you know another filler. And guess what, it sounds exactlylike Jet Pilot. Still I like it a lot more than Jet Pilot, because it isn't filled with screaming, actually I take that back, because it is probably the same. The repitiion in this song is, \\"We don't need to mulitply,\\" or \\"We don't need to nullify,\\" so its your choice here, skip it or not.    Chop Suey! 10/10. Thank god. A healer. The uprise of the album. This makes up for Jet Pilot and X. It really is beautifully made. It has good lyrics, and a strong meaning. People are usually familiar with this song, but the title is really random!Fast verses which stop, then explode into craziness, then it shifts into a different tone, which is a little more calm, but then it shifts again, so you're a little out of luck.    Bounce 10/10. I love this song. Its short and very catchy. Simple chorus too. Its kinda got a sexual meaning, which makes it funny as hell. Not a usual SOAD song, but they succeeded with a short little filler. This is a lot more enjoyable than X and Jet Pilot, because it is unlike them to make this kind of song. Two thumbs up guys!    Forest 9/10. Alright I gave it some time, and it actually turned out to be a great song. I usually need to listen to the song a couple more times to like a song I've never heard before. It could be shortened a little bit, but other than that, you're looking at a great song.     ATWA 9/10. Again, just like Forest, I gave this song a chance, and what do you know, its one of my favorites. The title stands for Air, Trees, Water, Animals, and it has to with Charles Manson's activist thing. Something like that he did, and if you look in the liner notes, they give thanks to him because he was truthful about something. It is a slow song, and the verses kind of drag on, but the chorus is really good, reminds me of Forest, but a lot quicker.    Science 9/10. You know the story. Great song, although I kinda disagree with the meaning, but who cares its a cool and short song. It is heavy, but it gives me feeling that it feels like it is isolate from every other song.     Shimmy 10/10. Short little song, but it is a little too short. It flows well though, and I'm guessing its about not enough education in some places in the world, but who knows. Verses are a flashback of Forest, just because he sings a little short part, then it goes into just a beat. In the chorus, how come when he says \\"YEAH!\\" really loud it sounds like the singer from Metallica?    Toxicity 10/10. Probably one of the most stand out tracks on the album. A big hit. Thats all there is to say.    Pyscho 9/10. Would give it a 10, but I've heard it to much. The, \\"Pyscho, Groupie, Cocaine, Crazy,\\" got too annoying. Great song.    Aerials 10/10 and 4/5. Amazing closer. Not like any other song on the album. It is song you would expect to be a closer.     Arto 4/5. Sorta like an Indian, sorry I mean Native American tribal song. Its a hidden track that is in Aerials. Its a whatever song, and its not needed.    Toxicity is a good album, but if the fillers were gone in would've been better.
B000002UZ1|5.0|In April of 1973, The Beatles had already released THE BEATLES 1962-1966. But in April of 1973, the same month & year, The Beatles released their 21st album entitled, THE BEATLES 1967-1970, the follow-up to THE BEATLES 1962-1966. This album features more of The Beatles greatest hits, only this time, the hits from 1967-1970 are featured. Nothing but the best of The Beatles. <br /> <br />Disc One: 1967-1968 <br /> <br />STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). A great song that I have enjoyed for years. This is amongst their greatest hits. <br /> <br />PENNY LAN <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Great song. <br /> <br />SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND <br />  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Definitely another greatest hit. That opening line, \\"...It was 20 years ago today when Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play...\\" is just the best. <br /> <br />WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS <br />  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Another great song led by Ringo. <br /> <br />LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS <br />  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Great song. Very 60s-cycodelic. <br /> <br />A DAY IN THE LIFE <br />  From the album SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND (1967). Seems as though that the SGT. PEPPER album was very popular, indeed. A great song. <br /> <br />ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Awesome. <br /> <br />I AM THE WALRUS <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). One of my favorite songs off of the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR album. <br /> <br />HELLO, GOODBYE <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Awesome. <br /> <br />THE FOOL ON THE HILL <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). Great. <br /> <br />MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR  <br />  From the album MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR (1967). The title track, at last. Great tune. <br /> <br />LADY MADONNA <br />  Fromthe single release LADY MADONNA (1968). Awesome. <br /> <br />HEY JUDE <br />  From the single release HEY JUDE (1968). This stood out as the biggest selling Beatles single out of them all. This one of their absolute best songs ever recorded. I know that on September 23rd of this year when I see Paul McCartney in concert for the very first time, he will do this song. I can't wait to hear him do it. Now this song was released as only a single back in 1968. But in 1970, just a few months before the release of LET IT BE, The Beatles put together another compilation album entitled HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN). Some new songs were put on the album, along with \\"Hey Jude\\", which is where the got the name for the 1970 compilation album. <br /> <br />REVOLUTION <br />  Original version from the album THE BEATLES (1968). Single version from the single release REVOLUTION (1968). While the album version was very good, I really enjoyed this version much more. <br /> <br />Disc Two: 1968-1970 <br /> <br />BACK IN THE U.S.S.R. <br />  From the album THE BEATLES (1968). My all-time favorite Beatles song, with \\"Hey Jude\\", standing right behind it. <br /> <br />WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS <br />  From the album THE BEATLES (1968). For a long time, I never favored this song. But after awhile, I began to like this song. <br /> <br />OB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA <br />  From the album THE BEATLES (1968). Okay, I'll pronounce one last time because I am Mr. Nice Guy. Here it goes: OH BLA DEE, OH BLA DA. I love this song. It's just a very fun song, a song for a everybody, who has a sense of humor. <br /> <br />GET BACK <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). I love this song. <br /> <br />DON'T LET ME DOWN <br />  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Great. <br /> <br />THE BALLAD OF JOHN AND YOKO <br />  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Blah! I hate Yoko Ono. <br /> <br />OLD BROWN SHOE <br />  From the album HEY JUDE (THE BEATLES AGAIN) (1970). Great. <br /> <br/>HERE COMES THE SUN <br />  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). Great. <br /> <br />COME TOGETHER <br />  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). This was another one of those many songs that I did not like, but years later, I began to like it. <br /> <br />SOMETHING <br />  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). Great. <br /> <br />OCTOPUS'S GARDEN <br />  From the album ABBEY ROAD (1969). This song is another fun-filled song led by Ringo. It would be Ringo's last written contribution, as well as his last lead vocal performance as a Beatle. <br /> <br />LET IT BE <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). Just a beautiful ballad. <br /> <br />ACROSS THE UNIVERSE <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). Great. <br /> <br />THE LONG AND WINDING ROAD <br />  From the album LET IT BE (1970). This is one of my all-time favorite songs from the LET IT BE album. Beautiful ballad. <br /> <br />    This compilation is even better than the first, since it features more of your favorite Beatles songs from '67 to '70. THE BEATLES 1967-1970 is yours if you buy a copy now.
0385338686|5.0|I am a big Shopaholic fan so I was very excited to read Sophie Kinsella's latest. Although The Undomestic Goddess was slow to begin with this book has proven to be one of my favorite books of all time. Not only did Sophie Kinsella create a loveable character (known as Samantha Sweeting) but she created a loveable story. I felt that this book really looked at life and what it's all about, while still maintaining humor and fun. This is a book that I would recommend to everyone who enjoys a good laugh and a good story. It is yet another winner from Sophie Kinsella!
B000002UYZ|5.0|In April of 1973, just three years after The Beatles had broken up, Apple Records released The Beatles' 20th album entitled, THE BEATLES 1962-1966. This double-disc album features all of The Beatles' classic hits from their PLEASE PLEASE ME album right down to their REVOLVER album. The Beatles may have broken up, but their music was still willing to go on, starting here with the first Beatles album to be released, since the breakup. <br /> <br />Disc One: 1962-1965 <br /> <br />LOVE ME DO <br />  From the album PLEASE PLEASE ME (1963). This was actually The Beatles' first hit single. I love this song because of its original sound and that harmonica is still very recognizable today. <br /> <br />PLEASE PLEASE ME <br />  From the album PLEASE PLEASE ME (1963). Another rock out song. I still to this very day love this song. <br /> <br />FROM ME TO YOU <br />  From the single release FROM ME TO YOU (1963). Great song. <br /> <br />SHE LOVES YOU <br />  From the album THE BEATLES' SECOND ALBUM (1964). This is a great song. This song is one of their absolute and top best. When *NSYNC was on their CELEBRITY TOUR 2002, they included four Beatles songs on their tour's setlist. This was the first Beatles song. The other three were \\"I Want To Hold You Hand\\", \\"Hey Jude\\", & \\"Twist And Shout\\". <br /> <br />I WANT TO HOLD YOUR HAND <br />  From the re-released MEET THE BEATLES (1964). Their album MEET THE BEATLES was actually the American released version of WITH THE BEATLES. So, MEET THE BEATLES & WITH THE BEATLES are the same album, but released with different two different titles, as well as different track lists. This song, which kicks a**, is from the American released version of WITH THE BEATLES. <br /> <br />ALL MY LOVING <br />  From the album WITH THE BEATLES (1963). This is another one of those classic songs. That opening line, \\"Close Your Eyes and I'll Kiss You...\\", is also another recognizable figure in The Beatles' song history. <br /> <br />CAN'T BUY ME LOVE <br/>  From the album A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). This is another one of those classic songs. You know, the A HARD DAY'S NIGHT album also serves a purpose as the soundtrack to The Beatles' first film entitled, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT. The album was the first soundtrack to have the guys sing every song on the album. But this song is just outstanding. <br /> <br />A HARD DAY'S NIGHT <br />  From the album A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). STRUM! \\"It's been A Hard Day's Night and I've been working like a dog. It's been A Hard Day's Night, I should be sleeping like a log. But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do that make me feel all right...\\" I love this song. That verse and that opening strum is just pure classic. <br /> <br />AND I LOVE HER <br />  From the album A HARD DAY'S NIGHT (1964). This is one of the best ballads The Beatles had ever done, with Paul McCartney on lead vocals. <br /> <br />EIGHT DAYS A WEEK <br />  From the album BEATLES FOR SALE (1965). This song is another classic. It's just a great song and great for Tribute Bands to use for audience participation. <br /> <br />I FEEL FINE <br />  From the single release of I FEEL FINE (1965). This is another one of the many greats. You know, John Lennon had recorded feedback on this song intentionally, which is actually the only time feedback had been recorded on a rock & roll song with the literal intention. <br /> <br />TICKET TO RIDE <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). This is one of their hit singles from their second film of the same name. This song would be later covered by The Carpenters. <br /> <br />YESTERDAY <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). This song was never one of my favorites. It is actually said to be the most recorded song in history. So many people in the music industry have covered this song. I can't even begin to count or tell you the people and how many of the people who have recorded this song. <br /> <br />Disc Two: 1965-1966 <br /> <br />HELP! <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). Ah, the album's hit title track. Great song. <br /> <br />YOU'VE GOT TO HIDE YOUR LOVE AWAY <br />  From the album HELP! (1965). Beautiful song. <br /> <br />WE CAN WORK IT OUT <br />  From the album YESTERDAY...AND TODAY (1966). This is also another one of my all-time favorite songs. Great song. <br /> <br />DAY TRIPPER <br />  From the album YESTERDAY...AND TODAY (1966). Not a favorite. <br /> <br />DRIVE MY CAR <br />  From the album RUBBER SOUL (1965). This song is one of the classics. When Paul McCartney sang this song on Live Aid with George Michael, I almost had a heartattack. Just to think that two of my favorite performers, one of them being an ex-Beatle, and the other being an ex-WHAM! member, singing a Beatles' tune. <br /> <br />NORWEIGAN WOOD (THIS BIRD HAS FLOWN) <br />  From the album RUBBER SOUL (1965). Awesome. <br /> <br />MICHELLE <br />  From the album RUBBER SOUL (1965). Great. <br /> <br />IN MY LIFE <br />  From the album RUBBER SOUL (1965). Never a favorite. <br /> <br />GIRL <br />  From the album RUBBER SOUL (1965). Great <br /> <br />PAPERBACK WRITER <br />  From the single release PAPERBACK WRITER (1965). Okay. <br /> <br />ELEANOR RIGBY <br />  From the album REVOLVER (1966). This is one of my favorite songs off of the REVOLVER album. <br /> <br />YELLOW SUBMARINE <br />  From the album REVOLVER (1966). Later included on the album YELLOW SUBMARINE (1969). This is a great song, especially for your kids. <br /> <br />    This album is just outstanding, covering The Beatles' earliest hits from '62 to '66. You'll love this album if you buy it now.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|The night before I purchased this album, I was watching 5 Years in a Livetime. After watching that excellent footage, I was really psyched to hear this album. Boy was I disappointed. This is not only DT's worst album, but one of the worst albums I own. Don't be fooled by these people who are rationalizing and giving this album 5 stars. I can't believe the band is actually touring with this dud. I haven't listened to this album in so long that I don't even remember the song titles. I just know that track number 2 is awful. They tried to write a moving ballad, but it just ends up sounding really sappy. There are no memorable Petrucci solos on this album at all. The solos he does play lack passion and seem unnecessary. The album as a whole sounds flat. The 24 minute epic is a complete bore. It's one of those pretentious Pink Floyd inspired songs which goes on for 10 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. I think Petrucci, Rudess, and Portnoy need to listen to their Liquid Tension Experiment albums to remind themselves of what a melody sounds like. I love these guys, but this album is just plain bad. These guys are way too talented to churn out this drivel. I hate the album cover too. Are you guys Dream Theater or Pink Floyd? Please go back to the drawing board and come up with something that is worth my money. Yes it's better than most of the crap out there today, but when do we come to our senses and accept that this is crap too?  <br /> <br />p.s. If you want a great album, check out John Petrucci's solo album Suspended Animation.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|In overall I think this dvd should have 3 stars, but when I look at the man dancing like he's fighting for his life, I just can't help myself... But I have to agree with some of the points that the person under me (Gregory B. Callahan) gave. It's nice to read a review from not a die-hard fan or someone who just comes hear to bash Michael Jackson. I am quite a big fan, but I don't buy everything from him (literally also..lol). And exactly.. Mr. Jackson comes with a package. It's not just like you see on this dvd, the hysterical crying fans, it's also all the stuff he has created around him, Im talking about everything but the music. But of course I shouldnt look at that right now, reviewing a dvd from him. To me he is the most amazing entertainer/performer. He is such a unique mover, just mesmerizing to watch. No one does he like he does, did it like he did. But on this dvd after watching a few performance I become easily annoyed by the crying fans. I don't like the way the focus is so much on them, it's like the concert is more about them than the person on stage. I mean, every one knows how crazy a concert can get with this artist, if you're standing in front. So when I watch this dvd I don't feel like I'm watching just a concert. Same with the audio, you hear far too much crowd. When I buy a live-dvd I want to see and hear just the performer and his music. That's what it's all about! <br />what I'm really waiting for is a release of a Bad Tour concert, especially 1988. The Jackson at this time was just 100% perfect. And the focus was more on the music and the performance... So I'll just keep on waiting...
B0000027I6|2.0|...I was expecting a lot more from this album. Some of my friends who, like me, are big fans of Pink Floyd (particularly the older stuff like Animals and Wish You Were Here) recommended this album to me on that basis. They indicated that anyone who really enjoyed the old Floyd, would get into this  right away. Not so in my case.<br /><br />Maybe I don't understand the concept of the album but to me almost the *entire thing* is a collection of (barely lyrical) ramblings by Waters. Few of the songs have any real rhythm or melodies to them. They're just sort of aimless collections of what seems like drunken grumbling by Waters, with choruses of women singing the refrains. It's just very strange IMHO.<br /><br />Maybe you have to be tripping a little to really get into this one, but for me it left a bad taste in my mouth after having such high expectations. *shrug* I'm sure I'll be in the minority but felt it worth noting that not all big-time Floyd fans will find this worthwhile as part of their collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not enough can be said for this show. Each episode had my wife and I on the edge of our seat wondering what is going to happen next. We laughed, she cried, we loved this show and ache for more.<br /><br />1) Characters all have something you don't just like but you love about each of them!<br /><br />2) You care about the characers, their choices and their consequences!<br /><br />3) Great humor and glib dialogue! Some of the best lines written for the screen.<br /><br />4) The Chines \\"swearing\\" is actually a wonderful touch espeically since my wife is Chinese and understands sometimes what the american accents are butchering<br /><br />5) More than satisfactory special effects!<br /><br />6) Great plots/storylines!<br /><br />This is a well, well thought out show that should see another season or 10. Can't wait till the Serenity movie next month. Give us more!!
0201626632|2.0|This book encourages graduate students to explore options beyond academia and appears to be overly biased in the direction of industry. This book strongly cautions against the assistant professor position. The arguement is that the fight for tenure can be circumvented by gaining experience in industry and then coming over as an associate professor. It makes one feel incredibly naive for pursuing a direct route to academy. <br /> <br />I don't believe the decision is as clear-cut as it is made out in this book. I have worked in industry and academia and many of the concerns outlined in the book occur in both places. Office politics, fighting your way up the totum pole, and the scramble for funding are facets of both types of jobs. I would take Fiebelman's advice with a grain of salt.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This was a great Movie, lots of action and smart scenes made Collateral a very enjoyable movie. <br />Good performances from all main actors.
B000286RNY|5.0|This is a comedy that I only find Wedding Crashers and maybe Old School to beat. This is chinese fun that most american comedies don't stand a chance against. One thing that this movie also has besides the nonstop laughs is the amazing visuals. From the martial arts scenes to the hilarious soccer scenes, the visuals are brilliant!  <br />Everyone already talked about the plot but I'll mention it anyway. The movie's about an old man who used to be a soccer star until his leg was broken, who forms a soccer team with a bunch of kung fu masters.  <br />This movie has nonstop hilarious moments which I'll let you discover on your own. Even minor things like the fact that the kung fu team is beating another team 40-0 is hilarious.  <br />Well, I recommend buying this gem because it will make you laugh your head off and humor like this is impossible to find in american movies.
6305076995|4.0|For those of us who are (ahem) over 25 this DVD is a great bit of nostalgia.  They don't make bands or music like that anymore. They don't do shows like that anymore, just mikes, amps and a few lights.  Rick Wakeman's keyboard rig is hilarious by today's standards. <br />  I don't mind the grainy film quality, that adds to the overall feel of the film.  I do wish someone would take the time to work on the soundtrack however.  It sounds as though someone stuck a mike at the back of the auditorium, a high quality bootleg type of sound.  That could be seen as a positive or negative. <br />  Yessongs is a great look at one of the 70's great bands when they were young and hungry.  \\"Classic\\" rockers, music history students, even archeologists perhaps will enjoy this trip down memory lane. <br />
B000059XUO|2.0|This movie is one of the most overated ever. Most of the reviews on Amazon are excellent ones but I have to disagree. Alex Proyas is an excellent director but this is his weakest effort of the 2 movies of his that I have seen. Dark City is a masterpiece digging into your minds days after you watch it. This movie isn't thought provoking, is predictable and is very dark. Batman is Barney compared to this. This movie is always dark. But, most of this movie's faults don't really matter because it's a superhero movie. At the start of all superhero movies, you know what's going to happen. But, I like superhero movies, as they deliver good laughs and awesome fights. This movie wasn't funny and wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be dark. And it was. Superhero movies are the easiest to make because they're croud pleasing as long as they have cool fights and awesome visuals. Who cares if it's mindless junk? It's still fun.  <br />But, this movie was really dark. It is a solid rental for fan of superhero movies but beware, it has over the top violence and curse words unlike other superhero movies. But, Blade had curse words and lots of violence but I still loved it. Well, I just don't know, but this movie was slow moving, weird and too violent. On top of it, there aren't really any cool fight scenes.  <br />In one shootout, the crow (not the bird, the superhero) shoots and kills everyone. But, he gets shot at also but he's invincible and can't die. This scene is lame because bullets just go through him and he deosn't die and just shoots them.  <br />The movie is fun and exciting at times but most of the time, it's weird, really violent and way too dark. This movie isn't like the other superhero movies. No this one is infested with drugs, nonstop blood and gore, and lots of weird stuff.  <br />This movie could have been an excellent movie but to me, it was a movie that was a descent watch that I'll never rewatch again.  <br />The only reason that this movie is probably famous is because of the tragedy that befell Brandon Lee in it. This is something horrifying and tragic, and bizarre.  <br />And don't even get me started about the acting. Good job by Brandon Lee but even he seems to not be into it at all. But all of the other actors/actresses were horrible, notably the skater girl.  <br />Lastly, this movie is made in a very corny and cheesy way. Why? Because one minute, the crow will be stabbing people and blowing up buildings and the next he'll be hugging a little girl. Oh and what the heck was up with the crow weird quotes. Why was he talking about the raven by Edgar Allen Poe? Is he supposed to be an intellectual zombie? Oh, and what's up with him talking about God and how God doesn't want people to use heroin. I'm sure he's drugged up in the movie! I mean, he must be on drugs to paint that weird stuff on his face. Sure it's cool looking but he must be high. For a superhero movie, this movie is a major letdown. And that makes it even a bigger letdown because superhero movies are the easiest movies to make. They all are predictable, they all have tons of problems but most are likeable. But not this one.
B0006L16N8|1.0|i was a fan of parachutes. a rush of blood to the head was ok. and this cd just didn't quite make it. coldplay's other two cd's were uplifting, but this one is depressing.  <br /> <br />the thing that i really dont understand is that singer chris martin just got married, has a child, has a wonderful life...then why are his songs depressed? isnt music supposed to be a reflection of your inside? <br /> <br />i wouldnt spend more than $3 on this cd.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Robocop is one movie that I'll never get tired of seeing. The movie is exceptionally made for 1987! Sure, some scenes are cheesy but for that time, wow! This movie is up there with the likes of the terminator. While I find the terminator to be a better movie, Robocop is close to it. Robobcop is a predictable, mindless movie that is fascinating to watch. To watch Murphy strapped into that big robotic outfit will make everyone grin. When he pulls out that huge gun, blows away some punk, and spins it around, you'll be like, wow, this is so cool. This movie is a classic with memorable one liners and fantastic humor. The action is nonstop of course. This movie is like a roller coaster ride, meaning that, it's in full gear, looking like it's about to end and then it keeps on going and there's more awesome to come.  <br />There's no need to talk about the plot because everyone who didn't see this should know it anyway. And for anyone grown up, 20+ who hasn't seen this! They're nuts! This is a classic! No, instead people prefer watching Titanic! Well, anyway, I really recommend buying this wicked cool movie in which a big cyborg kick everyone's a**!
630463949X|5.0|If you bought only one DVD of a music performance... this should be it. An absolutely flawless evening clearly illustrating that these five individuals were meant to be together. Electronic Stores used the DVD as their Showroom display. The best of the best.
B000001FS3|1.0|Not very good. I've read the reviews that give it glowing and detailed notions of why this is a greatest album....but I've tried listening to it and can't see it. I bought an ipod U2 edition (wanted the black and it looks cool) and figured I better put some U2 on it. Only right, huh?     Well, I was a senior in high school when this album came out and it didn't click with my harder rock tendencies. Also thought those friends who praised it were overrating this a bit.     Anyway I got the whole album and tried listening to it. More than a few times on the ipod....and my perception of the disc was correct, it's boring and not well produced. Maybe I'm missing something but I just don't hear it. A recent article in USA Today about \\"road songs\\" quoted a reviewer of \\"where the streets have no name\\" as saying how the song lifts and inspires...But how? It's probably the best track with the other single \\"with our without you\\", but the rest of the album is just plain boring and uninspiring.    I did also get Achtung Baby and REALLY like it. So this leads me to believe I'm not simply bigoted toward U2. The whole CD (Actung Baby) is great, not just the singles. Get that instead. I've yet to explore the other titles but am willing. I now know that The Joshua Tree is overrated.     Edit: And now have \\"How to Dismantle...\\" and \\"All That You Can't Leave...\\" BOTH beautiful and moving albums. Joshua just doesn't do it for me.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|...Is the only way to describe this movie, great acting by a great cast, great plot and an ending that can only be described as jaw dropping.   Thats all i have to say, dont waste your time ready anything else, just get your hands on this movie any way you can, as soon you can!   Highly, Highly, Recommended!
B00011F5DK|5.0|Blokus is easy to learn, there aren't alot of rules to remember, and it doesn't take forever to finish a game (average time is under a half hour). The game is challenging, takes strategy and is fun to play.  The first time I played it at a friend's house, I decided I had to buy my own game.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|BOY IS IT GREAT TO HAVE HER BACK!! SHES BACK!!!!!!!! YAY
B00008S2VG|4.0|Twenty years after her debut album, Madonna releases her tenth studio album, American Life. The facts are grim. Die another day was the only track to break the Billboard top 40. The title track, American Life, had minimal airplay, and all the remaining singles were lucky to get any at all. The videos didn't fair any better. American Life was pulled before ever airing. Hollywood premiered on VH1, a station known more for airing videos by artists like Dave Matthews and Sting. Her final video, Love Profusion, only aired on the internet. The critics tore the album to pieces, declaring it to be self indulgent dribble, lyrically embarrassing, a sure sign that Madonna had finally lost her touch. <br />I'm here to disagree. This album has very gradually become one of my favorites. I will review each track and leave you to take what you want from this review. <br />The opening track, American Life, is probably the hardest track to swallow. The music is somewhat abrasive and disjointed. Their is a clashing of electro and folk that is present throughout the album. I think what makes this track work for me, is the fact that it is so startlingly not what you expect to hear. The lyrics aren't all that bad either. The rap is very corny, but it is done intentionally I think. This is not the first time Madonna has dabbled in rap. Remember Vogue? Bette Davis- we love you! I hope you remember, it was one of her most successful singles of all time. The fact that the video was pulled and a cheap imposter was used in it's place, kept this single from going anywhere. Madonna's videos are very much a huge part of the success of the singles. I saw this video in a club in Minneapolis. They had apparently downloaded it prior to it being pulled off the net. The video was wonderfully entertaining, and I could see very little to be offended by. The only somewhat shocking image, is the now famous shot of her tossing grenade into an audience at a fashion event. The grenade is caught by a Bush look-a-like and used to light a cigar. It's hardly the highlight of the video. THe images of Madonna dancing in a dirty women's restroom in army gear is fabulous. The scene where she crashes [literally!] a runway stage in a mini-cooper toting rifles is awesome. She does a little dance while rapping to a terrified looking audience. <br />Hollywood is one of the funner songs on the album. The video was definitely colorful. Her performance with Britney and Christina at the MTV awards was entertaining as well. The song isn't my favorite, but it's enjoyable. I do love the end where her voice is slowed gradually as she tells us to change the channel. <br />I'm so stupid is the ONLY track on the entire LP that hasn't grown on me. I guess I don't agree with her claim. The music is alright. I don't care much for the way she anunciates the word STUPID at times. That DOES sound stupid. It's the weakest track, in my ears, anyhow. <br />Love profusion, the last song to be released as a single, is a great track. It's light and positive. The mixes of this song are also lovely. The single is worth looking into if you haven't already. There are no edits, but the song is so wonderful, you don't really care too much. <br />Nobody knows me is my favorite track from this album. It's stellar. It's right in the middle of the LP and that's where it belongs. She performed this track during her re-invention tour, and even though she stood alone on the stage, it was one of my favorite performances. The song can do no wrong. I absolutely love the lyrics, the music, and even the CHER-like voice thing they've done to her vocals. Should've been a single all it's own. Oh well <br />Nothing fails. A great ballad. The gospel choir makes the song even better. 'Makes me wanna pray.' The lyrics are incredibly simple, but that doesn't make them bad. I think it was intentional of her to write her lyrics that way. I could be wrong of course. Maybe M was trying to be deep. \\"I'm in love with you, you silly thing\\" doesn't strike me as someone trying to be deep, however. <br />Intervention, I've been told, is a song about her son. It's a wonderful track as well. Definitely up there as one of my all time favorite Madonna tracks. Here, she is lyrically on the ball. Great song. <br />X-static process is very UN-Madonna, which can be a little unnerving. It totally sounds like a track written for someone else. Don't ask me who. It's one of those \\"I'm exposing myself emotionally\\" songs. It's good. I personally would have left it to be a b-side myself, if I were Madonna. <br />Mother and Father is another cool song. SHe has performed it acoustic in concert, and it's still cool. Here on the album it has a very disco feel to it. Her vocals are very different. She sings in a voice I don't think she's used before, and it's refreshing. Incidentally, in X-static process, she sings hitting much lower notes than i think I've ever heard her use before. I think the great thing about this album is that it shows that Madonna has finally realized what range she sounds best. She now knows her voice front and back, so to speak, and is using it more wisely. If you've seen any of her performances in the last year, you know what I mean. It's wonderful to hear her these days. <br />Die another day. What a FREAKIN awesome club track. All the mixes are to DIE for. This song is so fun to play while speeding down the interstate in sunglasses. People have 'complained' that this is the worst Bond song to be recorded. To that I say \\"Shut up.\\" <br />Easy Ride closes the album, and like Gone on the previous release, it is a wise decision. What a cool song... So cool. It's on of those songs you listen all the way through, and then go, \\"Damn, I don't think I've ever heard a song quite like that before.\\" <br /> <br />Madonna doesn't need to be in the mainstream to be a talented artist. In fact, the true talents rarely are. I like to think this is the reason Madonna is gradually and gracefully getting less radioairplay. She is making the music she wants, she is seeking out producers that don't sound like the billions of others out there. To that she gets props. I hope to hear more from this woman who has inspired me to do what the Hell I want, and say F*** you to those who think otherwise.
B0009I7O7A|5.0|I dug this album at friends houses for a while, but never actually bought it because I was hearing it all the time. I purchased Heavier Things and really liked that. Once Sony announced the DualDisc version I decided I'd finally buy it. Like all the 5.1 releases I have bought so far I love feeling like I'm in the middle of the studio where they recorded it. Just remember you have to play the disc through a system capable of decofding 5.1 to enjoy the surround mix...it is SO worth it!
B00006EXL5|5.0|I am going to admit it: I discovered this band through \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\". I'm not even going to pretend that I like this album more.<br /><br />But if you could only buy of My Chemical Romance's albums, I would still say to buy this one.<br /><br />While \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" holds vivid imagery, energetic melodies and the like, in the end, nothing like that can compete with the amazing lyrics, symbolism, and placement of \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brough Me Your Love\\". \\"Revenge\\" is a story. \\"Bullets\\" is art.<br /><br />It begins with a short instrumental, which sets the slightly darker mood of this album. Afterwards comes \\"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us\\", from the very first lines making references to antidepressants and alchoholism (The amount of pills I'm taking/Counteracts the booze I'm drinking). There is even a spoken echo that can be heard, which makes a very nice touch. This album holds nothing back, and stops at nothing to get its message across.<br /><br />After that is the song \\"Vampires Will Never Hurt You\\". My Chemical Romance is not a simple, easy-to-understand band. This song is not about vampires. It is about how society sucks the life out of you, and how it drags you in. Much of it is screamed, but even the screaming is done in an artistic way. The vampire metaphors are prevelant, but there are other metaphors present as well, such as a whisper at the end of the track.<br /><br />The album isn't all morbid and dark; two tracks in particular stand out from the rest of the album for their brighter melodies: \\"Early Sunsets Over Monroeville\\" and \\"Headfirst for Halos\\".<br /><br />\\"Early Sunsets Over Monroeville\\" is very, very well done. It starts off with a happy, slow melody, and talks about a romantic night, using imagery that rivaled even \\"Revenge\\". This song relies less on explosive instrument work or screaming to show its emotion, and more on Gerard's singing voice. It is a little bit on the long side, but if you like the song, you won't even care.<br /><br />\\"Headfirst for Halos\\" is one of my favorite tracks. This track makes early references to suicide (I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling), but it is ultimately against it, telling the listener to \\"think happy thoughts\\".<br /><br />\\"Demolition Lovers\\" is arguably My Chemical Romance's best song, and it easy to see why. At six minutes, this song is to music as \\"The Odyssey\\" is to poetry; long, but beautiful. The vocals at the beginning are absolutely haunting, which is sadly something that isn't said often for male singers. The lyrics are also the most powerful on the album, speaking of dying for love \\"in a hail of bullets\\". It speeds up, slows down, and shows what My Chemical Romance is really capable of.<br /><br />There are a few tracks that I like a bit less than others (\\"This Is The Best Day Ever\\", for example), but that is a matter of personal taste. This album shows My Chemical Romance as artists, not entertainers, and makes a worthy addition to any collection.<br /><br />Best Tracks:<br />\\"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us\\"<br />\\"Demolition Lovers\\"<br />\\"Our Lady of Sorrows\\"<br />\\"Early Sunsets of Monroeville\\"<br />\\"Headfirst for Halos\\"\\"Headfirst for Halos\\" is one of my favorite tracks.

B00080Z53O|5.0|This Spanish film is superbly done, beautiful but emotionally gripping. This is not light entertainment by any means and don't expect to come away unaffected.  It is profound in the way it leaves the viewer with an insight on the assisted suicide debate regardless on where you stand on the issue.
B00012L786|3.0|Sam Fuller's \\"Pickup on South Street\\" is quite an unusual film. It is one of the few movies I can think of where there is no hero. There is not one character for the audience to get behind. Each person in the film is a lying, double-talking crook.<br /><br /> \\"Pickup on South Street\\" seems to want to work on two levels. On one hand it wants to be a crime picture. On the other it has a slightly political bent. It involves Communist.<br /><br /> Richard Widmark play Skip McCoy, a pickpocket, who has already been arrested three times and has just gotten out of prison a week ago. He is caught by an F.B.I. agent (Willis Bouchey) stealing something from a woman's (Jean Peters) purse. What was stolen was a piece of film. The woman's name is Candy and her ex-boyfriend told her to deliver the film to his boss. When Skip is spotted both he and Candy are going to find there is much going on they don't know about.<br /><br /> Skip had no clue what was in the purse and either does Candy. As the film goes on we find out Candy was being followed by police because the film contained government secrets. A patent for a chemical formula is all the information we are given. It turns out Candy's ex, Joey (Richard Kiley) works for Communist.<br /><br /> At this point in the film Fuller seems to have an odd message. The movie seems to support Skip even though he is a bad guy, a thief, but at least he's not a Communist, therefor he can't be all bad. The film excuses his actions making the other characters out to be the real bad guys. Is the movie trying to convince us to root for Skip because he is the lesser of two evils?<br /><br /> If it seems Skip is a good guy, he's not. Skip may refuse to give back the film to Candy and Joey, but it is not done because he is patriotic. Skip only thinks of himself. He doesn't do what he does because of his love of country, it is because of his love of money.<br /><br /> The movie also has a werid romance starting between Candy and Skip. It found it odd because we can never quite trust these people to know how they really feel. Plus I didn't think a romance was needed in the story.<br /><br /> But the movie does have a lot to praise. Richard Widmark is quite good in the movie. He plays a classic sleezeball, scumbag who deserves no respect, only a right to the jaw. I'm not sure if his acting is better here or in \\"Night and the City\\" but it has the same effect. I also liked Thelma Ritter as a tie salesman/informer who is always out to make a buck. Ritter by the way was nominated for an Oscar.<br /><br /> The movie runs at a little over 80 minutes, because of this it is a fun and exciting film. There is never a dull moment. That was just Fuller's style. He wanted to get right into the action and not waste too much time with set-up.<br /><br /> If some of my comments seemed off-base to you, I'd advise you to rent this film on DVD and watch one of the special features, it has Fuller in an interview discussing this film. In the interview, to my surprise, Fuller said much of what I thought while watching the movie. But what surprised me so was his attitude on the Widmark character. He seems fascinated by criminals. He doesn't think they are all that bad. At one point he describes Widmark's character as an \\"artist\\". I, as you can tell from my review, saw Widmark in a different light.<br /><br /> But I still think people should see this movie. It is well worth the price of a rental. *** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Fast paced, well acted crime film that has a political bent as well. Fuller strings things along nicely as there is never a dull moment in the whole film. Widmark is great to watch!to know how they really feel.

B000002LFZ|4.0|Fleetwood Mac is one of the most prolific bands in rock history. From their days as a blues rock unit to California rock gods of the 1970s' to a brief 1980s' comeback, they have gone through several changes in personnel and sound but have always managed to come out on top.<br /><br />In 1988, the single disc, 16 track \\"Greatest Hits\\" was released. It contained 14 of their biggest hits up to that point as well as two new tracks. One of them, \\"As Long As You Follow\\", was released as a single and reahced # 43 on the pop charts and hit number one on the Adult Contemporary charts. 17 years later (and after the release of the superior two cd \\"The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\"), this collection is still on the marke. Does it still hold up well? Here are the positives and the negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br /><br />-This collection includes all the familliar hits the casual Fleetwood Mac fan would want. \\"Rhiannon\\", \\"Say You Love Me\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Dreams\\", \\"You Make Lovin' Fun\\", \\"Tusk\\", \\"Sara\\", \\"Hold Me\\", \\"Gypsy\\" \\"Big Love\\" and<br /><br />\\"Little Lies\\" all are here.<br /><br />-Underrated gems \\"Eveyrwhere\\" and \\"Over My Head\\" are included as well.<br /><br />-\\"Rhiannon\\" is included here in its unedited version. This is the only collection I know of that includes it. \\"Sara\\" is also an extended version. Also, this collection has the studio version of \\"Big Love\\". \\"The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\" has the 1997 live version.<br /><br />-The two (then) new tracks, \\"As Long As You Follow\\" and \\"No Questions Asked\\" are excellent editions to the Fleetwood Mac catalogue.<br /><br />Negatives:<br /><br />-Two top twenty hits, \\"Don't Think About Me\\" (# 20) and \\"Seven Wonders\\" (# 19) are absent. This stinks, especially sicne \\"Seven Wonders\\" is one of my all time favorite Fleetwood Mac songs.<br /><br />-The sound isn't too great.<br /><br />-A lot of great popular album tracks are missing. Where are \\"Landslide\\", \\"Gold Dust Woman\\", \\"Never Going Back Again\\", \\"The Chain\\", \\"Second Hand News\\" and \\"What Makes You Think You're The One\\"?<br /><br />-The two cd \\"The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\" vastly beats this collection. It has all the exteneded \\"Sara\\" as well as the two new tracks, thus rendering this collection inferior.<br /><br />Botom line: good, but not needed anymore.akes You Think You're The One\\"? <br />-The two cd \\"The Very Best Of Fleetwood Mac\\" vastly beats this collection.

B0002OERI0|2.0|My friend gave me this cd to listen to and I have to admit I liked some of the songs. \\"Whatshername\\" and \\"Wake me up when September Ends\\" are still my two favorites. But, I tried playing some of their songs on guitar,but got bored because they just keep repeating the same power chords over and over throughout the whole cd. I'm not bashing Green Day, I just think they could have done a better job.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Not since the Tim Burton \\"Batman\\" movies have I enjoyed a super hero movie as much as I did 2002's \\"Spider-Man\\". With a superb cast, well written script and dazzling special effects, this film lives up to the standard set by the first two \\"Superman\\" and \\"Batman\\" movies, a rarity with most of today's super hero movies. Like those movies, \\"Spider-Man\\" has a well chosen cast (especially Willem Dafoe, who very nearly steals the show as The Green Goblin), dazzling special effects, great direction and a well written script. Some elements I thought were a little convoluted, but overall it was a very good plot. The film's sets were cool as well, very expressionistic. I'm kind of surprised it didn't get any awards. This film is among the greatest superhero movies of all time, and is one a lot of the modern day superero movies should try to beat.

B000001F7R|5.0|This albm ranks right up there with Boston's eponymous debut and Heart's \\"Dreamboat Annie\\" as one of the greatest debut albums ever. Def Leppard had been together for almost five years and had an EP out when their first album, \\"On Through The Night\\", was releaaed in 1981.<br /><br />\\"On Through The Night\\" is the most different sounding Def Leppard album Def Leppard ever released. By advised: you are not going to find \\"Photograph\\" or \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\" on this cd. Instead, you will find the band experimenting with different sounds and being very creative. Even before their big breakthrough with \\"Pyromania\\", Def Leppard was already standing head and shoulders over all other 1980s' bands.<br /><br />\\"On Through The Night\\" kicks off with the weakest song on the album. \\"Rock Brigade\\" has a nice chorus, but is really just a filler track. Things pick up quickly with \\"Hello America\\". This was the band's second single release. This is a great song, the keyboard effects are really cool a one reviewer pointed out. \\"Sorrow Is A Woman\\" is actually IMO a precursor the acoustic version of \\"Two Steps Behind\\". There's electric guitar on here, but the acoustic guitar is also very prominent. The song itself is a dark, midtempo ballad that is possibly Def's most underrated song ever. \\"It Could Be You\\" is a loud, fast Leppard rocker that hints at the later days but still fits well with the rest of the album. \\"Satellite\\", as many reviewers pointed out, has a 1960s' vibe to it, and is a fun litle ditty.<br /><br />Track six is one of Leppard's darkest songs in their entire cannon. \\"When The Walls Came Dumbling Down\\" is like Led Zeppelin, 1980s' style. I liken this in a way to \\"When The Levee Breaks\\". Most reviewers will disagree with me on this, but I hear a lot of Zeppelin in this track (also, check out \\"Die Haard The Hunter\\" from \\"Pyromania\\"). It is a cool rocker with a creepy intro. \\"Wasted\\" is the song that started it all. This is their first single, and my what a debut: the guitars are awesome, the drums are fierce and forceful and Elliot sings his lungs out. My favorite song on the album. \\"Rocks Off\\" is a \\"Hello America\\" - type track, very fast paced and with a faux audience. Not great, but cool. \\"it Don't Matter\\" is a throwaway, but \\"Amswer To The Master is a great rocker. Closing out the album is the nearly eight minute \\"Overture\\". This starts off a slwo and builds up into an awesome rocker and a great close to the album.<br /><br />This is an awesome cd.

B00079FUI6|5.0|Even before the now popular series aired, I would see billboards and magazine ads all over the place simply saying \\"Desperate Housewives\\". I didn't know what to think. But my curiousity was piqued. I was determined to find out what this new show was. When it debuted, I was instantly hooked as I thought, \\"This is going to be a hit\\". I was right.  This has become a phenomenon and rightfully so. The characters, the storylines, the humor, the sympathy we feel for them-all believable. I'm sure we can relate to one, if not all at having been there at one time or another.  I work in a pretty stuffy, male dominated office and I was surprised to discover that it's a hit there as well! Some of my co workers, who are in the 60s, enjoy discussing the show more than I do!  As a HUGE fan of Knots Landing and being a teen when I remember laying eyes on Nicolette Sheridan and falling in TV love. (For those avid TV fans, do you remember her back in Paper Dolls with Lloyd Bridges?) She was awesome as Paige Matheson back then and she's even hotter than ever as Edie Britt now!! (That scene where she's washing her car? HOTT!)  I'm glad for her sake, lightning does strikes twice.   The cast as a whole is terrific and has a lot of potential. Looking forward to a long run, being as desperate as ever to watch!

B0000E6I1J|4.0|I really liked the way the album reminded me of all the great music that the quiet Beatle gave us. Georges friends obviously enjoyed making it as George would have wanted them to.
B00097A5HW|4.0|I love a great voice.  A great voice can be like Mariah Carey's:  strong and soaring and suited to just about any genre.  Or, a great voice can be like Shakira's: a voice that can turn itself inside out, one that allows Shakira to convey the exact mood of her intentions for a song.   <br />  <br />I am totally smitten with the track \\"Para Obtener Un Si.\\"  Was Shakira channeling Astrid Gilberto?  It is just about as close to perfect as a song can get!  Of course, the duet with Alejandro Sanz (\\"La Tortura\\") rocks.  I really like the \\"Shaketon\\" remix, too.   <br /> <br />I confess I came late to Shakira...  With \\"Laundry Service.\\"  To me, the album is a musical powerhouse.  Ballads, rock, pop songs, English, Spanish...  And of course, that voice that can sound like a lost little girl or a rock 'n roll diva.   <br /> <br />With \\"Fijacion Oral\\" I venture to say that even those who do not speak Spanish will be able to understand and really feel the lyrics and music.  Shakira seems to craft each song with blood, sweat and tears and then present it with humility and honesty.  This is one of those albums that allows the listener to discover new things almost every time:  there are layers and layers of meaning and emotion.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Hi all! <br />  <br />I gotta share this! This is extrcated from an e-mail I sent out late 2004  <br /> <br />As I sit here, I am totally astounded... <br />  <br />I have just put in disk 1 of the 4 disk \\"Star Wars Original Trilogy'' box set, released in the UK yesterday Monday the 20th, namely \\"Star Wars - A New Hope\\", into my Pioneer DV575 player, and what appeared on my SHARP 32\\" (82cm) 16:9 flat screen has truly made my jaw drop! I have never seen DVD quality like this....NEVER!  <br />  <br />The colours, oh man...the colours! The clarity.....the sound.....the sound is so good I had to turn my system down! <br />  <br />\\"Lord of the Rings Trilogy\\"? Oh please! Sit down and shut-up! \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\"? Sit down and shut up!  <br />  <br />\\"A New Hope\\" looks like it was shot yesterday, let alone 1975! <br />  <br />I must admit that I am fortunate enough to have a system that allows for the maximum picture quality allowed by modern, current, conventional (Interlaced) systems, namely RGB (via SCART output / input) allowing for pretty much the optimum of the PAL spectrum, namely 625i resolution, which is pretty much just the next thing down from full-blown Progressive-Scan quality (625p) via Component output / input.  The result though, via interlaced RGB input, on my 16:9 flat screen, is distractingly good! The colours and resolution clarity of the picture that I'm witnessing is almost too much! <br />  <br />Even if, for whatever strange reason, you are not into \\"Star Wars\\" or have never seen the films (um..er...where have you been??), but you are at least a film fan, then do your self a huge favour, buy or at least rent this box set....do it, do it, do it!  <br />  <br />  <br />

B000002KXV|5.0|It's hard to believe this solo album from Steely Dan's Donald Fagan came out in 1982. While it came out several years before CDs became all the rage, I remembering listening to The Nightfly on a silly contraption called an audio cassette. I was amazed at the quality of the recording. Crystal clear instruments combined with a pop contemporary jazz sound that far surpasses nearly anything I had heard before. 23 years later (!), it still sounds like it came out only yesterday.<br /><br />The album itself contains songs you'll always remember. The songs are all about the late 1950's and early 60's, a time of optimism and fear at the same time. Naturally there's the cold war party anthem hit \\"New Frontier\\" about having a time with a girl he meets in a fall out shelter. There's the slow strolling Lieber cover of \\"Ruby Baby\\", the strangely upbeat \\"Goodbye Look\\" where he watches a goverment overthrow from a beach, to \\"I.G.Y. (What A Beautiful World)\\" an ode to where we'd be in underwater railcars in \\"90 minutes from New York to Paris\\" and the future in general was bliss. And don't forget the bittersweet title track of the amusing late night DJ, \\"...with jazz and conversation\\" while he hopes his old flame is listening somewhere. All with arrangements that transcends musical styles. In today's age of CD's, people may gripe about it's fairly brief running time of 38 minutes. But this album is about quality, not quantity. And the quality of this album's cup runneth over. This album is absolutely required for anyone who has ears. Period.
B00005JNTX|1.0|Ranks high on my list as one of the top worst movies of all-time.  An incredible cast in a swampish, dark and disturbing movie.  This is clearly a movie made for fans of the graphic novel and not a film for 98% of the rest of the world.<br /><br />Between a scene of a person having their head dunked into a toilet full of stool and the storyline of a young girl that avoids molestation only to fall in love with the old man that saves her...there's just not a lot to like here.<br /><br />You've been warned!
B0000TLA9G|4.0|This is a great g'n'r compilation featuring the work of this great american hard rock band and contains almost all their hits like WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE,PARADISE CITY,SWEET CHILD OF MINE and NOVEMBER RAIN.It would have been complete if they had included ESTRANGED in this compilation.anyway a great collection.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|At our house, Judy Garland musicals have become part of an annual cycle: Easter Parade in Spring, The Harvey Girls in Summer, and, of course, Meet Me in St. Louis in Winter.  Despite the title and the progression of the narrative over the course of a year, this is essentially heartwarming family Christmas story that provides us with a glimpse into a world long past.  The casting is superb, and the interweaving of traditional music and the Martin & Blane songs written for the movie is seamless. <br /> <br />We loved our VHS edition to death and replaced it with the DVD version which offers better sound and crisper scenes.  The bonus interviews are fascinating, too.  It was quite interesting to learn that \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" originally had a somewhat morbid tone.  In short, I highly recommend the movie and the Two-Disc Special Edition. <br />

B000002ADT|5.0|\\"Kind of Blue\\" is widely considered one of the seminal works of American jazz composed within the latter half of the 20th century. This is pure, classic Miles Davis - prior to his transformation into the quasi-psychedelic free jazz genre (best exhibited on \\"Bitches Brew\\" 10 years later). Equally enjoyed by Jazz veterans and novices alike, no self-respecting music fan can deny the simple genius of this album. Throw in such jazz heavyweights like John Coltrane, Bill Evans and Paul Chambers, and the rest, as they say, is history. Do yourself a favor and buy this timeless classic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not surprised by the number of five-star reviews here, since the show has its die-hard fans, but I don't wonder at some of the one-stars either. Some people won't get it, or won't be able to get past its quirkiness. But I tell you now, suspend your disbelief for a few moments and you will enjoy.  <br /> <br />I'd almost forgotten about this show after being enraptured with it during the initial Fox run. But then I saw it back on the SciFi network, saw the trailers for the new movie, and wondered--was the show as good as I remembered, or has my taste matured beyond the point where I could enjoy it? I say without reservation that Firefly is better than I remember--a pleasure to watch and hear, a feast in the barren wasteland of today's shows. The writing is tremendously sharp, the actors are entirely believable--to the point where, for example, one of the characters, having gotten all the information he can out of a prisoner with a minimum of effort (not even using his large knife), complains that he was \\"hoping to get myself an ear,\\" you feel a little sorry for him.  <br /> <br />It is a western in space. And not really even in the figurative sense: Whedon takes the six-gun and cattle into space and plops them down on scrub worlds, and peppers the dialog with Chinese swearing just for fun. I don't know whether the show would have supported a run of many years, but it stands remarkably well. Breathe deep.
0451191153|5.0|While reading The Fountainhead five years ago I neither sought nor felt any real deeper meaning or lesson from it.  I found it to be incredibly well written and thought it had excellent character development (with the exception of the protagonist Roark, who was too unusual to connect with in real time.) It is engaging and easy to read.    More important is how often I find myself thinking \\"what would Howard do?\\" in stressful work and other life situations.  If one judges a persons ego on their unwillingness to compromise a principal for the main purpose of staisfying others, Roark had the worlds largest ego.  If one judges ego on their need to be admired and praised, he had no ego whatsoever.    Compromising your principals will win you praise from others.  Praise feeds the ego.  Ego raises our expectations of what the world owes us.  Raised expectations lead to self entitlement.  Self entitlement leads to dissappointment.  Then, when the world   fails to deliver what your ego thinks it's owed, you have compromised your principals as well so there goes the ego!      Roark had absolutely no interest in being praised.  He wanted to create structures as he envisioned them and he wanted Dominique.  He got what he wanted and everyone else went home dissappointed.    This is almost a cartoonish way to live your life.  One would never find long term happiness in treating their family and friends this way but I frequently come across situations where the thought of Roark makes me consider whether I'm doing something to win praise and feed my own ego or doing it because it's the right thing to do.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|First off, it's Dream Theater.  They're one of only a handful of bands whose CD's I will buy without having heard anything from them.  Still, I'm not really sure what to think of Octavarium. <br /> <br />This is probably the most keyboard-heavy album they've done so far.  It starts (and ends) with a single piano note, followed by pulsing synth-bass.  Then comes the guitar stuff.  The intro of \\"The Root Of All Evil\\" sort of adds layers, until the whole band comes in with a bang.  This song probably has the best riff on the whole album. <br /> <br />\\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is probably the softest DT has ever been.  Sometimes I enjoy this song; other times I simply endure it. <br /> <br />\\"These Walls\\" is okay, but a little too nu-metalish for my tastes.  \\"I Walk Beside You\\" sounds like a shameless bid for airplay, but I can't help singing along... <br /> <br />If I connected a powerful enough set of speakers to my chest and played \\"Panic Attack\\", it would probably cause heart arrythmia.  It almost does anyway (anyone know of any other \\"progressive rock\\" drummers who can do a decent blast beat?). <br /> <br />\\"Never Enough\\" is good the first couple of times, otherwise, it's forgettable. <br /> <br />\\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is an interesting take on 9/11 (and religious fanatacism) that starts with bewilderment and ends with anger.  It's also one of those rare tracks where they let LaBrie write lyrics. <br /> <br />The title track is... well, it's really long.  The intro alone runs over four minutes, and while \\"Octavarium\\" has some interesting moments I still have no idea what it's about, or how all the pieces fit together.  However, the lyrics in \\"Full Circle\\" are rather amusing, and I couldn't help chuckling at the snippet from \\"Jingle Bells\\" in the middle of that long, long, LONG (did I mention it's long?) instrumental passage.  Perhaps the guys are loosening up a bit?  Oh, and since everyone keeps bringing up the theme of 5's and 8's, \\"Octavarium\\" runs twenty-four minutes.  24/8 = 3, and 8-3 = 5.  Okay, maybe it's a stretch... <br /> <br />This is probably going to be the most unhelpful review you will ever find.  Buy your own copy, or borrow a friend's, then draw your own conclusions.

B000002LPD|3.0|After the pop flourishes of their previous albums, 5150 and OU812, Van Halen went back to their hard rock roots on For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Their hardest album since Fair Warning, Edward Van Halen's guitar takes center stage and the band truly sound rejuvenated. Unfortunately, there is a noticeable inconsistency in the songwriting from which the band has yet to recover.<br /><br />There are a few great hard rockers as tracks like \\"Poundcake\\", \\"Judgement Day\\", and \\"Runaround\\" are among their best from the Sammy Hagar era. The band plays these tracks with conviction and Sammy's vocals are in top form. \\"Pleasure Dome\\" is another great track and features  lightning fast playing from both Alex Van Halen and Michael Anthony, The hit single \\"Top Of The World\\" is very good and is easily the catchiest song here. \\"Right Now\\" features a memorable piano hook from Edward and is also a strong track, even if it's more known for its preachy video. \\"316\\" is a cool instrumental from Edward, much more subdued than the hyperactive guitar workouts like \\"Eruption\\" and \\"Spanish Fly\\" from the David Lee Roth era. The remaining tracks, \\"In 'n' Out\\", \\"Spanked\\", \\"The Dream Is Over\\", and \\"Man on a Mission\\" are strictly competent hard rock and don't hold up to repeated listenings. All told, while For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge may sound like heaven for hard rock fans, the songwriting doesn't compare with their best work.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Is Sufjan Stevens insane?<br /><br />\\"Illinois\\" is only the second stop on a planned collection of 50 state-themed albums. It's the type of project whose sheer scale and mad ambition boggle the mind, calling forth a number of rhetorical questions: Is he really going to spend the bulk of his career on such a huge project? Given the fact that \\"Michigan\\" came out two years ago, shouldn't he pick up the pace a bit? Will he really make a separate album for, say, North and South Dakota?<br /><br />I hope so.<br /><br />Illinois is a great album, almost certainly the best of the year so far. It opens with a delicate and beautiful piano track entitled \\"Concerning the UFO Sighting Near Highland, Illinois.\\" From there, Stevens criss-crosses the state, heading to Jacksonville, Decatur and Chicago, creating a musical travelogue as thorough as any Rand McNally guidebook.<br /><br />Importantly, Stevens doesn't spend all his time going from point A to point B; he also stops to get to know people, writing about everyone from John Wayne Gacy to Superman to Abraham Lincoln to Carl Sandburg. Some of the references amount to little more than name-dropping, but the beautiful Superman song and the haunting Gacy track show that, most of the time, Stevens is really trying to understand how a place could be embodied by such disparate characters.<br /><br />Thematically, too, he covers a lot of ground. \\"Oh, God of progress, have you degraded or forgot us? Where have your walls gone? I think about it now,\\" he asks in what is probably the only song that will ever be written about the Columbian Exposition of 1893. For good measure, he throws in a little religious imagery later in the album; though his observations here feel a little self-centered and angry, you have to give him credit for honesty and candor.<br /><br />Musically, Stevens borrows from a range of styles, from Iron and Wine's hushed folkiness to Philip Glass's bright string and flute and vibraphone arrangements. Somehow he pulls it all together, though; the album's tone ranges from the playful optimism of \\"Come On! Feel the Illinoise!\\" to the breathy atmospherics of \\"The Seer's Tower\\" but still feels like the creation of a single creative genius. \\"Are you writing from the heart? Are you writing from the heart?\\" the ghost of Carl Sandburg asks him on the third track; the next song, the chilling \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr.\\" answers with a resounding yes.<br /><br />I'd never heard of Stevens before hearing the glowing reviews for this album; now that I've heard it, I'm looking forward to catching up with a musical trip down I-94 to \\"Michigan.\\" Hopefully by the time I'm done exploring his back catalog, he'll have the next state done, and hopefully it'll be as good as \\"Illinois\\"; even though I wonder how he can possibly finish this cross-country odyssey, I'm looking forward to riding shotgun.es from the playful optimism of \\"Come On!

B000002UAU|5.0|Just in case any dufus out there might miss the point and somehow not see that the album in itself is a work of art, the Beatles seem to make the point itself hard to miss with their album cover which has cut-outs which you can build into artwork if you so desire; a not so subtle hint?<br /><br />What can be said that hasn't already been about just how great this album is?  I hope that they'll remaster it the way they did the recent \\"Number 1s\\" or \\"Let it Be...Naked\\" albums where every track seems to have been given a new lease of life after the treatment.<br /><br />Just how good is \\"Sgt. Pepper's...?\\"; when we are all dead and gone, a copy of this album will be a permanent exhibit at the Smithsonian so that future generations will know just how important this album was to rock music for years to come.  Oh, and that is was a great work of art too. : )
B00025ETIW|3.0|I liked the song \\"Helena\\" so I checked out the CD. It's an okay CD. They're a good band but it's a bit too generic, I mean too many bands sound just like them. They're also too MTV orientated. That reminds me that they're sort of pop-rock, and not alternative, and I'm not a fan of pop-rock and especially NOT an MTV fan, I despise that channel. The song \\"I'm Not Okay I Promise\\" is the only original one, it has a very up-tempo beat. Every thing else is just bland, nothing \\"WOW!\\". Only buy this if you're a hardcore pop-rock fan.

B0000640VN|4.0|I love the idea that some of those who give this film a low rating gave it that rating because of the horrendous idea that a woman of the 21st century just might prefer to live in another time period. I mean, some of you are simply aghast at the notion!<br />Well, I have some disturbing news for you. I have met real true-to-life successful females who openly admit to wishing they could live in an earlier time. And these are not your typical readers of your so-called \\"historical\\" romance novel type women, but honest to goodness successful-in-their-career-who-have-a-passion-for-and-spend-their-spare-time-studying-about-the-past women. Go figure!<br />Now, as for Kate and Leopold: Others have successfully given the plot of this movie, so no need to go into detail again here. This is a fun fantasy movie that will bring laughs and leave the viewer satisfied after watching it. Unless, of course, you are the type of viewer who will analyze every little detail in every scene. If that's the case, why would you rent or purchase this in the first place?<br />By the way, the DVD has a pretty good line up of extra's, including deleted scenes.<br />Also, pay very close attention to the beginning of the movie, when Stewart is running from Leopold while in 1876. Did you see Kate/Meg? Look again...
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Okay - Copy protection can be bypassed with a little homework, agree it sucks and I will not buy another CD that has it.  This is the only way we will see it go away, when lost legitimate sales are greater than illegal copying losses. Shame this record company mandated BS is going to cost the boys record sales - guess they should have been a little more careful when signing their contract. <br />Now onto the music... we have two very interesting CDs of music, but with a little editing we have one outstanding CD that rivals the Foo's best \\"There Is Nothing Left To Lose\\".  What made that 1999 CD a classic in my mind was the mix of heavy and lighter melodic rock.  So I pulled my favorites from each disk of Honor and made a similar experience to TNLTL.  Here is my track order - In Your Honor, Best of of You, What if I Do, No Way Back, DOA, Miracle, Another Round, Resolve, The Deepest Blues are Black, Razor, End over End. Give it a try or mix your own favorites, before the record companies figure out a way to stop this as well!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|People have to remember that not all Beatles fans are old farts like me but there is a whole new generation of listeners out there who have heard all the fuss and want to find out what's it all about.  Expecting this new generation to listen to mono stuff and go wow! is just plain ridiculous.<br /><br />Even an old fart like me would like to see all the albums remastered and given the treatment like this album and \\"Let it Be...Naked\\" to bring them into the context of modern days.  Those of us who can't move with the times should cuddle up with our LPs and not force our old fashionedness onto the new generation.<br /><br />Speaking to you new guys, you have come to the right place; not only have all the tracks been remastered and I think never sounded so good, but this is also a great sampler of the band's work throughout their career.  Hopefully, your interest will be piqued enough for you to want to go get remastered versions of their whole albums themselves, especially starting with \\"Rubber Soul\\" onwards where you have to listen to the whole album aka work of art to truly appreciate why this band is great and continues to be great after all these years.<br /><br />Speaking also as a musician who has recorded cds for others, there is a big difference between what is played and heard by the musician and what gets transferred to disc.  The more modern our technical equipment gets, the better and more \\"true\\" the original sound gets transferred to the disc.<br /><br />To say \\"true\\" sound is old LPs with hiss and analog shows that you have never been in a recording studio and have never played a note in your life.  Bands put up with that because that was the best they could do in those days.  If the Beatles could record with the modern equipment that they have now, they would have done so in a heartbeat believe me so that you could hear the sounds that they heard in the studio themselves.<br /><br />So those of you young ones who want a taste, this is a great cd for you to get but like I said earlier, try not to judge the band from this album alone as they were more than just a singles band but try on their later albums as well.  Hopefully, someday, they will all get the same remastering treatment as this wonderful cd did as well.t cd for you to get but like I said earlier, try not to judge the band from this album alone as they were more than just a singles band but try on their later albums as well.

B00005JNSK|5.0|I grew up with the Gene Wilder version. I adore the Gene Wilder version. Gene Wilder played the perfect Willy Wonka. But at the same time, Johnny Depp manages to bring a whole different depth to the character. As for the kids, the Oompa Loompas, the music and the factory itself, the new version is highly surperior, hands down no question at all. The only real difficult call is which Willy. Since everything else in the new version is pretty much better, I'm going to have to go with the new one but at the same time, I know that every once in a while I'll go into other Willy withdrawl and pull out the old one just so I can truly enjoy Gene Wilder's amazing performance. Both actors managed to pull Willy off with amazingly different facets. Gene does a wonderful slightly malicious whimsy and Johnny does an excellent psychotic Mr. Rodgers. Don't write either of them off. Just don't watch one right after the other.

B000003RCY|5.0|Incredible debut from a band most fear. This album has almost everything needed to be perfect. A friend of mine told me once that the guitars on this album are right in your face.......and they are. Heavy catchy riffs engulf this album from start to finish, burning through each track. There is so much variety on this album(much more than I expected to hear). This album makes me want to thrash on the dance floor and sing in german. A couple of setbacks on the songwriting and production(bass guitar is hidden in the mix). I'm sure anyone who is into the industrial thing already owns this but if you don't............what are you waiting for?????????
B000002UAO|5.0|If you were to say that this was the best Beatle album ever, it would be very hard to objectively say that you were wrong.  Even George Harrison thought it was so.<br /><br />Critics say that \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" was when people began to see the rock music album as artform but I'd have to disagree.  The seeds of such a view must have already been planted by Bob Dylan and from the Beatles' point of view, with \\"Rubber Soul.\\"<br /><br />Dylan himself after listening to this album hailed it as the time they decided to stop being \\"cute.\\"  Granted even as a 'boy band' the Beatles were light years ahead of the sorry excuses out there right now as they both played the instruments and composed much of their own material and even the 'boy band' stuff was very musically interesting/challenging as well.<br /><br />However, this very well produced Dylan-inspired album is what made me respect them as a band.  Although they started out in the business looking to make a \\"few bob\\" and then do other things with the money, they realised with this album that they were musicians and musicians had to grow (hope N'Synch, BBMak, Britney ad nauseum are listening although it probably would be beyond their abilities to do anything about it).<br /><br />The album that inspired the Beach Boys to stop being a boy band themselves and to create the brilliant \\"Pet Sounds\\" which in turn inspired the Beatles to create the also brilliant \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" should tell you volumes about the impact and quality of this album and this fact alone should move you to get a copy of this if you have somehow not heard it before.<br /><br />Now on a more personal note, if I can get our Japanese friends to remaster and re-release the entire Beatles catalog in miniature LP sleeve, I'd line up overnight to get my hands on that!  Oh and while you're at it, could you also please do the same for Depeche Mode and R.E.M.?

B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is  the best prog album since  Pink Floyd's Wish You Were Here (1975). And there are some similarities between both of them. Guitarist Omar Rodriguez was born in 1975.  Both albums contain five songs. Both albums are inspired by a tragic loss of a friend and band member. I am not a fan of At The Drive In ( I don't like punk) and  I was completely shocked to discover  that ATDI gave birth to the best prog group of the last 20 years. They have the vibe  of 70's music- from  Led Zeppelin (Rodriguez mentions Jimmy Page as main influence) to  Pink Floyd as well as Yes , Santana, Uriah Heep, Rush  and  many more. But they're not copying any of these groups. Omar Rodriguez   is an incredible guitarist and songwriter, he plays relentlessly  and the combination of his  psychedelic /agressive sound with the amazing voice of singer Cedric Bixler and his  twisted lyrics takes you to a wonderful musical journey. Just set the volume high and  forget about reality. You don't even need do decipher all of the complex lyrics, some words  made up by Bixler. They  only  serve to guide your  fantasy and emotions. Every time  I listen to the album I discover a different aspect of their music.  Absolutely stunning experience.  And, amazingly, despite the overall sad mood of the album,  it won't depress you. I can't stop listening  to this masterpiece! De-Loused in Comatorium was alredy a masterpiece, but Frances The Mute  is even better! And  all  musicians playing on the album are amazing, especially drummer John Theodore , basist Juan Alderete and keyboardist Ikey Owens. The album turned out to be so great that they decided not to put the title song on it (although the lyrics are present in the booklet). It is true  in a way that the song  doesn't fit in, but it's also excelent and you can get it on the single The Widow.
B000002MJR|5.0|Have you heard my new heavy rocking song yet? It's called Heavy <br />Rocking Fuel. It's definately one of the best. Listen to it, download it to the computer and play it a thousand times. It's <br />got a really great heavy metal sound to it. A song you must repeat on this album.
0385338686|3.0|I am a big Can You Keep a Secret fan, so I was looking forward to a SK book that wasn't part of the Shopaholic series. The book is very cute and also interesting, but totally unrealistic. Of course, SK's books are all a bit unrealistic, but this one is plain silly. The book tries to end about 3 or 4 times before actually coming to a conclusion. It was a cute book but fell apart at the end. If you like SK, you'll prolly be able to look past the flaws, and you'll like this book. I wish that I'd borrowed it from the library instead of purchasing it, though.
B0000057C5|3.0|I own all of their cds(excluding live) and have come to the conclusion that this is their weakest offering. Not to say it is worthless.....there are many awesome tracks through out the cd. But the overall batch of songs that were written,then chosen are just not as great. I don't know what happenend to them after their debut. Sehnsucht feels and sounds like a watered down version Herzeleid. The songs just don't seem to have the bite that they should have. The production is very thin for some reason and the vocal stylings seemed to have taken a step backwards.I certainly do recommend this along with their other albums..............but there is no rush to get this one.............save it for last. <br />
B000088E6D|4.0|I am grateful that have actually found someone who likes to sing and can legitimately interpret these tunes.  He is a little young, but very good. (Rod Stewart on some oldies...I mean really now...the public was desperate for good music!)  Mr. Buble has A LOT of guts, for two reasons. One, it is VERY difficult to do covers and not have the public wince at them. (Like in these reviews) I love his take on the brothers Gibb song.  He does such a good job here.  He has his own sound and style (softer and smoother for sure) yet having them sing background is so sweet and respectful. I love mixing the old with the new....and also when artists get this to work. (remember Bing and D. Bowie?) His version of \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\" is better that the original.(Sorry Lou.) There is no other way to describe His version of \\"Fever\\" but to say it's adorable! (I am not saying this just because I like the way he sings my name..Woohoo!) Risky for sure but, he pulls it off.  Two, the mix he put on one CD.....Queen, Paul Anka, Sinatra etc....very unique, but again, I think it works. He has some pretty heavy \\"picks\\" but no one can say he can't sing them. He is a crooning 40's-50's James Dean type. Very neat.<br /><br />I look forward to hearing more from him and to see where he goes.<br /><br />He is one that will be fun to watch as his style matures.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Man has Avenged Sevenfold changed. They were much more brutal and hardcore with \\"sounding the seventh trumpet\\", my first A7X CD that I bought like 2 years ago, it was awesome. Then I bought Waking the Fallen, another amazing CD backed by powerful vocals that you can really rock out to and you can listen to the CD over and over and still be amazed. They were one of my top 5 bands, but with their latest release \\"city of evil\\" they became sell outs, their are no hardcore screams of any sort and M. Shadows turned into some sort a pussy with his at times annoying, nasaly, whiny singing. Unless you are new to the band and only heard of the band because they sold out with the bat country video, you will be disappointed from their previous work. But I must admit their are some really good guitar solos on this album, too bad the band had to turn to mainstream with their sound, they were amazing, it saddens me.
B000065U1N|1.0|Read the book, don't watch this movie. If you're looking for an honest depiction of war, read books. I don't know why Hollywood can't make truthful war movies, every one of them turns out like Rambo or something. What made this event unique was the moral decisions about whether or not to shoot civilians that were aiding the rebels, and how to hold out against a whole city that wants to fight you. It's an amazing display of modern weaponry, and if this movie was made properly, it wouldn't have been so boring. Unfortunately, this film had the cooperation of the Pentagon, and as such, it resulted in a plain-jane, vanilla movie. The Delta Force takedown of the technical really disgusted me, as it never was in the book. It tried to make them look like superhuman ninjas, when in the book, they were nothing but extremely well-trained soldiers who were just as vulnerable as the other Rangers. Sadly, the movie skipped on trying to convey the awe the other soldiers held for the Deltas. Maybe one day, this book will be adapted properly, but this is what we have to deal with. We Were Soldiers was also pretty Vanilla too, I'm sure the book had more depth too.
B000066C1N|4.0|As I didn't expect this CD, I was a little bit surprised at his gooood sounds because his work was more than I expected in this CD.  In my opinion, if you were his fan, I think you would not feel losing money for purchasing this CD!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The first time I heard this it was pretty cool, (I wasn't really big on the single first off, I've heard better singles by them),  but now after another listen and owning Mesmerize, I think it is just as HEAVY and down right insanly fun as the rest of their albums.<br /><br />System of a Down is a really awesome metal band, I would check out every album they put out. If you want really heavy and crazy vocals this is the band for you. Funny too!<br /><br />One flaw with the album is that it's really short, not that its that big of a flaw. The album is a fast listen and when you're done you might just play it again.<br /><br />MEZMERIZE YOUR FACE WITH FREAKIN HEAVY INSANITY!!<br /><br />Great metal band!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You can't do better than Joss Whedon's Firefly. A sublime and entertaining mix of western and science fiction, Firefly is wonderful. Once again, you've got to wonder what those \\"gorram\\" network exec's are doing when they pull an inventive series like this in favor of people getting covered in rats or jumping out of airplanes... The scripts are clever and surprising, the mix of western and Asian cultures is colorful, and the cast is dead on perfect. Enjoy the stories (especially \\"Out of Gas\\") and prepare yourself for the feature film due out this fall.
B00005JNTX|4.0|comic book noir at its most pulp fictiony best.4 interwoven stories that takes place in a city on the outskirts of hell,baSIN city.here,laws are up for the bidding and its best if you brought a lot of money.the first and last stories(which are the same)involve what one can surmise a contract killer played by a narrating josh hartnett.this opens the movie with him and a woman on a rain soaked rooftop.this is then followed up by two great performances by bruce willis and micky rouke.story 2 has bruce willis playing det hardigan;a cop 1 hour away from retiring with 1 last case to solve.theres a child killer on the loose with connections that run high and deep.story 3 is with micky rouke playing marv.he is a 2 time loser looking for his 3rd shot.he gets it in the form of goldie;a beauty with an agenda.after a midnight tryst,marv awakens to find her dead and the cops on their way up to see him.again,the perpetrator has his back well covered by powerfull higher ups(an especially creepy elijah woods plays a cannibalistic silent psycho with lee press-ons from hell).the last tale is about an excon with a new face and a couple of women he cant get out of his sytem.clive''dwight''ownes is that ex con(besides bruce willis,everyone is some form of a con).the women in his life are britney murphy,who is a bar bunny with another man(benecio del toro)she cant ditch.rosario dawson is the other woman.she is the madame of sin city.when dwight goes to exact revenge on del toros woman beating ways,all heck breaks lose.he follows del toro to sin city where he tries to head off anymore of his brutal behavior.turns out that dawsons chicks dont need no stinkin hero to protect them.she has her onw terminatrix named mejo(meho?),a ninja femme fatale.well,del toro seems to be strikiong out with the ladies.he and dwight had a run in earlier at murphy's place where del toro got a toilet bowl facial.well,mejo wastes no time exterminating del toro and his goons.but of course,theres a problem....thisyou will have to find out on your own.everything works in this nightmare world of frank millers.i am somehow hoping that this becomes a franchise(although most of the charactors will not be back if there is one).this is what comics to movies should aspire to be like.

B0002858YS|1.0|i bought the album b/c i heard Mr. Brightside & loved it.. however, soon discovered that that and Somebody Told Me r the only decent songs on this cd... wut a waste of money
B000002J1U|5.0|Zeppelin 3 rocks hard and yet slow bluesy tunes at times which is great, because I love a variety. An underated album like some say. I even like it better then Zoso(An overated album, but awesome).<br /><br />3 gives you right of the bat, IMMIGRANT SONG = Amazing opening song for a hard rock band! Then it gives you FRIENDS = beautiful acoustic song, when I heard it the first time I loved it right away. CELEBRATION DAY is a very cool upbeat rocker (My, my, my, I'm so happy, I'm gonna join the band) awesome guitar. Now what I may consider to be Led Zeppelins best ballad blues song SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVIN YOU, amazing song! OUT ON THE TILES = \\"All I need from you is all your love, all you got to give to me is all your love\\" Great hard rock song. GALLOWS POLE! = Really freakin awesome upbeat rock feast of a song! TANGERINE = Beautiful. THATS THE WAY = Beautiful, but not as good as TANGERINE. BRON YR AUR STOMP = get down and boogy! Great song to groove to. HATS OFF TO (ROY) HARPER = Strange, but good in a unique dark bluesy way.<br /><br />This was an awesome buy for me a few years back, it was nice hearing some LED ZEPPELIN that you would probably not hear much on the radio at all, which is a shame. The radio sucks anyways...why listen to what they want you to hear, when you can listen to what you want to listen to which would be this album, do not miss out on LED ZEPPELIN 3!<br /><br />MY Top 3 Favorite Zeppelin albums are LED ZEPPELIN 3, LED ZEPPELIN 2 and HOUSES OF THE HOLY. Heck all of their music rocks, but don't start with Coda or In Through The Out Door, although good, not their best at all.<br /><br />ZEPPELIN 3 is the way to BE...<br /><br />Heck I even own a Zeppelin 3 shirt!
0679720200|5.0|Well, I could write another wonderfully pretencious review for this, but I won't. It's a good book, in my opinion. There's no guarentee you'll like it as it's a bit of a downer. But I think what makes it so good to me is the peculiar regularity and normality of this character's life. I mean within reason. There is a human life splayed open in nihlistic glory filled with suffering and death. And what can be drawn from it? No more than the thought \\"You live until you die\\"
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This album is right as I expect Foo Fighters to be. Nevertheless I don't think this one would be special. As an album, I'd call it extraordinary, as a Foo Fightes album, I'd call it average. It's worth the money, I'm happy to own one, but still I'll be looking for the next album hoping they'll bring it closer to the early sound of the Foo Fighters music, which I personally recognize as their best.
0804115613|5.0|I read this great book for the first time for a book report in the 8th grade.  It has remained at the top of my list ever since.  This is a truly endearing and heartfelt book that is guaranteed to make you laugh and cry.  I promise there is at least one character in this book that you can relate to and recognize.  I think we all have a dear Ninny Threadgoode in our lives...someone who truly brings out the best in all the people who are lucky enough to meet her. I really enjoyed the relationship between Idgie and Ruth.  I was shocked several years ago when I read that they actually had a lesbian relationship.  I guess I was just so engrossed with the compassion and friendship they had for one another that I totally missed the point.  I would strongly recommend this book to any fan of any genre as this book has it all, including comedy, mystery, romance, and drama.  The book also features several tried and true country cooking recipes in the back that are sure to send you to the grocery store for ingredients.  This is, in my opinion, one of the best books of our time.  Don't take my word for it though, go see for yourself!
1563894696|5.0|The Batman in this comic is drawn better than any others  The action and violence shows how dark the dark knight truly is  There doesn't need to be a lot of print because the extra amount of drawings helps add to the story  Tim Sale is the best artist period  The subplots only add more too the story  It isn't even close to being too much like The Godfather  There needs too be a large rogues gallery too show who gets involved in the mystery but most of all because it needs to show how many possible suspects Batman would have to choose from  The double twist ending is superb  If I hear any more bad reviews than I might have to become the next holiday killer  Angelina Ballerina?  What are four?  Dumbass list-Angelina/tmoney/Richard/Emerick/Alejandro/Joseph
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I had never heard of AV7fold when I heard a cut of this new CD so naturally I wanted to know more so off I went and listen to the first 4 CDs now I know why I had not heard of them. Scream singing and distortion are not my fortay. Then they give us this the natural progession from Nickelback, to SALIVA, to Velvet Revolver the next step in purist Rock great vocals, great harmony, and BLAZING BRILLIANT Guitar work with a Abrams 1A Tank bass and drumming. I am overwhelmed that these guys could go from where they were to here, a quantam leap. I have been listening to guitar driven Rock from 1963 to now AV7fold is this generation's Hendrix/LedZep, Velvet Revolver showed pure Rock always sells Avenge Sevenfold is capable of new frontiers. Rock lives, Metal has it's place, but great rock in the words of Jack Black 'can change the world and melt your face'!!!
0393314804|5.0|I'm going to start by saying the movie didn't do it justice. I'm knit-picking here. But I think something was lost in the movie that the book offers. It's somewhere in the humanity of it. Yeah these characters are druggies, most of them, or off their rockers or both. But it's in these momments we can see our own lives really. In the repitition of their drug habits, in the rituals in their dreams. We have a skewed mirror of ourselves. Like in the end, we just want to be happy. Free of evils. Free of demons and skeletons. We want freedom and a bot of peace. I think Trainspotting does a good job of showing these simpler desires. <br />Oh and um... Spud is the man... thought I'd just add that in...
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas is a legend, FULL STOP, his albums prove this, \\"Illmatic\\",\\"Stillmatic\\", \\"...I Am\\", \\"Nastradamus\\" and \\"It Was Written\\" and also\\"The Lost Tapes\\" are some of the best lyrical poetry i have heard since......early N.W.A. <br />Nas' latest album, \\"Street's Desciple\\",is not quite what i was expecting, after hearing the classics as said above. <br /> <br />Stand Out Tracks:- the whole album stands out,(even the Intro) but if you are infuriating and insist not to get the whole album, I recommend \\"N.Y. State Of Mind\\" which potreys, obviously N.Y., \\"Halftime\\", \\"Life's A Bitch\\" with another fanstastic lyricist in the form of,AZ. Also, \\"One Love Is a great song which i find very easy to relate to. <br /> <br />Overall, anyone who doesn't give this album 5 stars, is either, a 50 cent dickrider or a listener of Chingy,Nelly & Bow Wow, therfore not knowing what real hip-hop is.
6305897786|1.0|I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, so I thought I would like the movie regardless of what I had heard about the story.  I was so wrong.  The movie was slow and very boring.  Johnny's performance was definately not his best.  Not even his good looks could help this one out.  If you're still curious, please rent before you buy even if it is on the clearance shelf!
B00025ETIW|5.0|The first My Chemical Romance video I saw was, like most of you, Helena. I was scared! I thought, \\"Good God, it's set in a funeral!\\" Then I actually looked up the lyrics and read them before downloading Helena, Cemetary Drive and Thank You for the Venom. I listened to those songs for at least two hours straight and found, through multiple forums, how many poser-emos there are that said \\"im lyk sooo goffick cuz my fav song is helana by my chemical romance!!!!!! lyk garerd is soooooooooo hottttttt!!!!!!!!!\\" and I wanted to slap them. (Go ahead and call me poser-emo/poser-punk/poser-goth. It'll make my day.) I bought this album to show people that Helena ISN'T the only good MCR song... and because people were calling me a poser for wearing an MCR shirt... anyway.  <br />Can you believe how many people don't know what Gerard's last name is? It's Way... retards. Actually, Frank Iero is hotter than Gerard... but we're not getting into that right now. People call themselves 'fans' when they've heard one song-- Helena-- and don't know the lead singer's name.  <br />One word: <br />Posers.
0393035158|3.0|I agree with Mr. Harris on most points regarding suicide terrorist needing some belief in an afterlife for motivation/rationalization.  <br />I can't quite imagine atheist suicide bombers proclaiming \\"GRAVITY IS GREAT,\\" before popping a cap! <br />His chapter on the \\"morality\\" of torture gets pretty mushy though. I read it without knowing where the author stood. <br /> <br />By the bye,to : <br />&lt;&lt;Mr Harris, do you remember?, August 3, 2005 <br />Reviewer: Make it happen! \\"Jean\\" (Frankfurt, Germany) - See all my reviews  <br />Mr Harris do you remember Hitler and Stalin? Both had indeed much in common, above all they were both atheist and killed millions in a very short time.>> <br /> <br />--Stalin was educated in a seminary and Hitler was a Catholic (the ever-moral Church never got around to excommunicating him)! <br /> <br />Nazi Germany (you know, it takes more than one man to commit genocide), that aided and abetted Adolph was Lutheran and Catholic, and their hatred of Jews was sadly, well founded in NT scripture! <br />Harry Truman killed more humans in a shorter time than anyone in history. Even Stalin & Mao couldn't match 60,000 in ~3 seconds! <br />Sorry! <br /> <br />
068987474X|5.0|I read the book after my sister bought it for herself. In my experience, almost everything in it is true. Except that I don't have to sleep with all of my boyfriends. <br />Example: My new boyfriend was telling me about his past right after I read this book. He said he \\"dated\\" this girl for a little while, but never really \\"asked her out\\" because, as he said, \\"I just didn't like her THAT much\\" - he might as well have said \\"I just wasn't that into her\\".
B00018D44U|5.0|We've got some girl setting up false accounts just to accuse Ms. Jones of not honoring her Eastern roots - please! Then some reviewer feels the need to compare her to Etta James. Should every guitarist in the world get knocked for not being Jimi Hendrix? If you want Etta, go listen to Etta. This is something different.<br /><br />For me, and I suspect most people who dig Norah Jones, it's mainly about the quality, the actual sound of her voice. That is simply an innate gift, and all the singing talent and vocal training in the world isn't necessarily going to be able to compete with that. Tracy Chapman is another example. Music snobs whine that Tracy's a 2nd rate musician, but nothing sounds like her voice and no one I've ever seen even looks like her (and she's written some great songs). Just wondering: why would Dolly Parton, a living legend to millions, bother recording with Norah if she saw nothing special about her?<br /><br />This album is on the mellow tip and I tend to think the best songs are the softest ones. I do prefer COME AWAY WITH ME, but that's largly because country music plays a much greater role on FEELS LIKE HOME and that's not really my thing. This record isn't so easily classified as \\"country\\" or \\"blues,\\" though. \\"Be Here to Love Me\\" by Townes Van Zandt might very well be the best track here, but it's a tough call. Admittedly, this might suggest to some that Norah isn't quite at that level of songwriting yet, but to claim she sucks is nothing but mean-spirited drivel.<br /><br />One extra note that is totally irrelevant. Norah Jones is not only a wonderful keyboardist with an incredibly sensuous voice, she's strikingly beautiful. Just to look at her, I'd say she's an old soul. That's reflected in her music and she's already accomplished a great deal at quite a young age. I think this unfortunately makes a lot of people jealous.
B00004SVID|5.0|I made this review to help you decide if it's worth your money if you already have The Wall. I will not rate the songs because that is no help at all. (This will make more sense if you have the studio recording) <br /> <br />1,Master of Cerimonies- Just the begining intro to the concert <br />2.In the Flesh?-No diffrence <br />3.The Thin Ice- Slightly extended intro and ending <br />4.Another Brick in the Wall- No diffrence <br />3.The Happiest Days of our Lives- Laughing sound effects slightly diffrent, no scream sound effect going directly into nextsong <br />4.Another Brick in the wall pt.2- Longer guitar solo <br />5.Mother-Longer <br />6.Goodbye Blue Sky- No diffrence <br />7.Empty Spaces- Diffrent Words <br />8.What Shall We do Now?-Pt.2 of Empty Spaces which was originally cut from album <br />9.Young Lust-No diffrence <br />Plus a cool instumental song! And I will stop there. You basically have the idea. Plus, it's better to listen to it and notice the diffrences yourself. The only reason I bought is because I am a huge Pink Floyd fan.

B00005NEUF|5.0|this is a great debut. ever song is catchy in its own way and the lyrics are good also. In the title of my review i put UK issue, meaning that this is 5 stars for the UK issue. The North American issue has been ruined by taking off NYC cops and replacing it with another track which sounds like something to slap on a single as a bside. Rumours say that it was removed from the album after release because of the september 11th tragedy, which isn't surprising and was probably best to take the track off. But i do think it's stupid that they still dont issue the North American album with NYC Cops on it. People are going to be able to hear the track anyway from a little thing we call the internet.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|If you want to see an adventure movie, this may not be your right choice. Many people consider the movie 12 monkeys is a strange and uncomfortable movie and difficult to understand the stories.  <br /> <br />However, if you are a person who really love the concept of time travel and is interested in the debate that if history can be altered by time traveler, this would be the classic movie which demonstrate the idea that the tract of history is predecided.  <br /> <br />So, if you are interested in time traveling concept, this would be a movie that you definitely should see.
B0002858YS|4.0|Pumped out with heartfelt exuberance and gripping melancholy, this album is a collage of relationships that have ended tragically, emphatically, pleadingly and perhaps even with macabre joy. The vocals are fuzzed out and blend stupendously with the bass and guitars that form the spine of the music. This is what make the Killers different from pop-rock; the experience is not all vocals-oriented. Brandon Flower's earnest and shaded voice weaves in and out of the instrumentals with verve, but the heart of the emotion emnates from the awesome riffs and thumping beats. Whenever the lyrics start repeating, the focus shifts to the interplay of electronic rhythms and beats that keep this music alive. So you have... <br /> <br />Jenny Was a Friend of Mine - Fantastic start, sounds like a good single. Its catchy, and the vocals are something awesome <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside - What can I say? Absolutely classic, great imagery and always destined to be a hit. Best song on here. <br /> <br />Smile Like You Mean It - Mellow, almost to the point of losing the listener. But the guitar really comes through on this one <br /> <br />Somebody Told Me - Hello! Prime, meaty stuff, great to jump along to. Can't help belting out the chorus everytime you hear it <br /> <br />All These Things I've Done - Different style. Killers meet the church choir! With spellbinding results. Like Brightside, you have to hear this one to believe it  <br /> <br />Andy, You're A Star - Takes a while to get used to this one. The instrumentals really come out to their best on tracks like this one, and you'll start looking forward to it soon enough <br /> <br />On Top - Upbeat, catchy with a zinger of a drumbeat. All about finally making it. <br /> <br />Change Your Mind - This is where the album starts to sag a bit. The vocals are lazy, and the lyrics just don't cut it <br /> <br />Believe Me Natalie - Along the lines of Andy, but far more underwhelming <br /> <br />Midnight Show - Wake Up! After the previous two tracks, you need something like this to jolt you, get you up on your feet, and start rocking! One of my favourites. The music reaches its crescendo... <br /> <br />Everything Will be Alright - ...only to be wasted by this snooze of a track. Thankfully the bonus track after this rocks it back to the best of the Killers! <br />
0743424425|5.0|This book is truely scary.  Take a character Jack Torrance.  A character seemed doomed from the start, and seems more and more doomed as the book goes on.  The history of the hotel and *people* inside the hotel are truely disturbing as well.  probably because business is so corrupte like this oftenly.  jack torrance is a frightening, violent character raised upon violence and uneasieness, so that is all he knows, and all he can teach except for english literature.  stephen king writes horror stories that will leave you different, as if you grew up, or just got tougher. <br /> <br />recommended only for mature readers.  this may not contain many sex scenes ( i said many, not none)but the domestic violence will surely turn anyone's mind, including mine.

6304415346|5.0|This is, without doubt, the best Star Trek movie.<br /><br />As a Star Trek fan since age 4, there are a number of \\"inconsistencies\\" in the plot line, however. For example, the Romulan Neutral Zone is presented as only a few minutes away from Earth, although Earth is in the Aplha Quadrant while Romulus and Remus is in the Beta Quadrant. Also, Picard's blood feud with the Borg surfaces, although it was absent in The Next Generation (he had the opportunity to destroy the Borg in TNG and did not go for it!). And also, for the fans, we could have seen more than just 2 minutes of a space battle between the Federation and the Borg, something we missed out on in Part 2 of \\"The Best of Both Worlds.\\"<br /><br />Notwithstanding, First Contact is an excellent addition to one's DVD/VCR collection, due to its gripping plotline, action and also shows the viewer the opening events that paved way to the UFP being forumlated at the end of the movie.
B00005JNJT|2.0|This introduction to Batman was mediocre.  One line that haunts was when Liam Neeson says \\"you burned down my house and left me for dead, consider us even.\\"  NOT TRUE!!!!!  yes, bale did burn down his house, but he did not leave him in a burning house ready to die, he picked him up and ran out.  he left him in the car of a neighbor.  HE DID NOT LEAVE HIM TO DIE!!  HOW COULD THEY LET THAT LINE PASS!!!!  that on line nearly ruined the film for me.  but there were other parts to help that.  Gary Oldman, such a graet actor, but he had an uneasiness that Sean Penn usually has.  I kinda doubt someone like that would be a sargeant or luteinant of the police department in a city like gotham where the crime is equal to the bad parts of detroit.  christian bale simply did not cut it as batman either.  he seemed like a college kid trying to find himself in the real world.  putting on a black suit and fighting crime at night seems to be a wierd way to discover your interests, but im only 17, what do i know.  and yes, i expected more from christopher nolan.  but it wasnt all his fault.   the scripts these days REALLY REALLY SUCK!!!!!  the two best written movies ive seen in a long time were sideways and the aviator.  charlie and the chocolate factory was decent, but thast it.  the screenwriters and directors really need a fire under their butt.  or it could be the producers or companies like MGM or Warner Bros., or DreamWorks... The movie industry is taking a real pounding.  I WONDER WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002KHH|5.0|THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS A DISTANT CLASSIC FROM LONG AGO...YET IT IS SO RELEVANT TO TODAY AND EVERY MOMENT OF THE TIMES OF YOUR LIFE..WAR PIGS KNEW IT WAS GOOD THE DAY IT WAS BORN....HAND OF DOOM, ELECTRIC FUNERAL...IT IS A REVOLUTIONARY ALBUM THAT BORROWS FROM ZEPPELIN AND THEN TURNS AND TEACHES ZEPPELIN A THING OR TWO ABOUT A THING OR TWO! IT IS ROUGH (LIKE MUCH OF SABBATH)..THE DRUMMING IS SPECTACULAR AS IT BORROWS ERNESTLY FROM KIETH MOON AND BONHAM...TONI IOMMI IS AN INSTANT GENIOUS SMASH TO BE IMMEDIATELY RECONNED WITH AND THE WEIRD SCARY VOICE OF THE TORTURED OZZY AND HIS TOUGH ENGLISH UPBRINGING  ON HIS SLEEVE---SIMPLY A FIRST IN AWESOME ! VERY GLOOMY...DOOMY..BACK WHEN THIS CAME OUT, THEY ALL KNEW A NUCLEAR WAR WOULD END THEM IN THOSE DAYS EVENTUALLY YET HERE WE ALL ARE STILL HERE !!! MORE THAN ENTERTAINMENT ! THIS WAS THE FIRST 'REALITY' ROCK....WE'RE ALL BETTER BECAUSE OF IT; FIVE STARS.
B0006284JQ|3.0|Obviously, Britney Spears has come a long way after only 6 years in the business. She's already had many hit singles (maybe not chart-wise, but popularity-wise). Her debut with \\"...Baby One More Time\\" appealed to us. Her sophomore \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" shocked us. Everything she does interests the public. How does \\"Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (Limited Edition)\\" do the same? Well, it doesn't exactly do what she usually does. <br /> <br />This is a good album to purchase if you don't already have all her CDs. All her singles are in this album; there is even an extra B-side track, \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun), previously released only in one of her singles. Of course, it is nothing to jump around about, though the music and lyrics does make you wanna do that. There is nothing really special about this CD except for the fact that you get all her singles combined into one. <br /> <br />The bonus CD is nothing special. They're remixes of some of her singles. Nothing Britney fans haven't heard before. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"Greatest Hits\\" is something for ultimate Britney fans and for those who like her music, but haven't purchased an album yet.

B0000262QW|3.0|l thoguht we got rid of these people. but no!. they are still alive in our collections and we cant sell them because nobody wants to buy those silly fast jazzy records. <br />the big dilema with chck corea is his moustache! ..his super gay mustache. and l dont want to extended this to clarke. <br />well...this music, not the weather report thing, is over now. he now it. we know it. it dont mean a thing altoguh it have swing!. <br />please...buy this and l want you ,all over the world, to reply to me what kind of stereo car do you have to make this music enjolable...? <br />perhaps l dont write very well in english but..l think l say more than corea`s music...the stupid silence for children.

B0006L16N8|4.0|For some reason, it has become popular to bash Coldplay's music these days, and I'm not exactly sure why that is.  Maybe they became popular so fast, and when people realized their songs centered on insecurity, rejection, and miscommunication, the general consensus was that Chris Martin was too much of a wimp to be a rock star. I don't know though; there's just been a negative backlash against these guys lately.  What I do know and can definitely say is that Coldplay does one thing: they put together albums full of beautiful music.  There are plenty of bands in the world who are more musically inventive, or who take greater risks instrumentally.  There are also plenty of bands who write lyrics that are more ingenious, or more daring.  There are very FEW bands, however, who make music as beautiful (I keep repeating the term because I don't know a better way to say it) as Coldplay's.  On that note, I would say that this album is a success.  Perhaps it isn't as good as Rush, but perhaps in 3 years, it will be revered much in the same way.  All I can do is judge this album purely on its merits...not compared to another album, or another band, both of which are approaches that make little sense to me.  In forming an opinion of an album, one should derive all commentary solely from the experience of that particular album, not some arbitrarily chosen previous or parallel musical entity, which may or may not have any influence or relevance.  My experience with listening to this album has led me to conclude that it is at times energetic, at times tranquil, and at times provacative...but at all times a pleasure to simply HEAR.
B000002I2G|4.0|Alot of people have panned this album as a Doors weak link...and even back in it's day, it took abuse from some critics as too mellow for the Doors...It does contain the doors classic \\"Touch Me\\"...and over all it has a sort-of weird yet 'non-psychedelic' rock opera feel to it...It was interesting to watch a super confident band like the Doors suddenly struggle and try to copy all the bands around them like the Who..bands that in the studio atleast, the Doors always dominated...now, the Doors seemed alittle unsure...which was odd indeed..ofcourse Morrison was having super drama problems and problems with alcohol and whatnot in these days of the soft parade and that is evident here,,,,,\\"Wishful Sinful' is a great doors song and it is here so is the mini who like opera 'the Soft Parade\\" at the end...its Doors 'experimentation' and it is that album (sorta like the stones their satanic majesties) that every 60's band 'had to do' as a semi-rite of passage..to get to their next blues era........THIS IS A GOOD ONE THOUGH...YOU SHOULD PURCHASE THIS FINE FOUR STAR DOORS ALBUM !
B00004YYDI|4.0|This is a very good action pack movie along with showing the real humanatarianism in a professional assasin.  To him it is only a job and deep down inside he is a very sensitive and caring person. His care and affection for his young orphaned protege is heart warming.
B000002UAO|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF ROCK'S SO CALLED 'UBER-ALBUMS' ALONG WITH PET SOUNDS BY THE BEACH BOYS AND I KNOW YER ALL SICK OF PEOPLE BABBLING ABOUT AND REVIEWING THESE ALBUMS OVER N OVER BUT I HAVE TO SO HERE IT GOES......I MAINLY LIKE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH BECAUSE I DISTANTLY REMEMBER IT FROM WHEN I WAS FOUR OR 5, THE YEAR WAS 1969 OR 70' AND ONE OF MY OLDER BROTHERS OR SISTERS 'LEFT' THE ALBUM OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM FOR ME TO 'DISCOVER' THERE ALL ALONE...AS THE LITTLE ALMOST TODDLER I WAS, I WOULD PLAY THIS ALBUM...TURNS OUT..WHAT I HAD WAS THE 'AMERICAN' VERSION...NOT THE ONE WITH 'NOWHERE MAN\\" !! AND APPARENTLY, I WOULD PLAY IT OUT THERE ALL ALONE ENDLESSLY..TIL ONE DAY I WALKED OUT AND I FOUND THE RECORD BROKEN (hmmm)...and was that my first sad moment??)...AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS...I REMEMBERED THE MELODIES AND ALL THE JUICY SONGWRITOR PARTS FROM SONGS LIKE 'ITS ONLY LOVE\\" AS I GREW ...A FEW YEARS LATER IN 73' WHEN THE BIG BLUE AND RED CAPITAL 'BEST OFS' WERE COMING OUT...THATS WHEN WE ALL WENT INTO BEATLES HEAVEN AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD..ITS ALL HERE...MICHELLE, DRIVE MY CAR (ALSO NOT ON MY BROKEN VERSION), BUT THANK GOD THE KILLER 'WAIT' WAS AND THE STUPID RINGO TUNE WASN'T ; A CLASSIC ...FIVE STARS

1878424319|5.0|I think this book sets out basic principles that are easy to achieve if one has integrity. Also complexity and intelligence are an intricate part of the toltec path. I think that integrating the information in this book with a book I recently read called 'The Art of Stalking Parallel Perception' by Lujan Matus as well as 'Journey to Ixlan' and 'The Active Side of Infinity' both by Carlos Castaneda, gives the reader a broad spectrum analysis of the toltec wisdom.  <br />These books I think allowed me to arrive at a state of personal power and to be a better person.
B000000W5L|5.0|This \\"Stones Double album\\" (in the late 60's/70's every super band was obligated to do one) is in reality over hyped , overblown and overrated...THAT BEING SAID IT IS A CLASSIC WITH \\"Sweet Virginia\\", 'Rip this joint'...and a buncha good connector songs inbetween the obvious huge hits here like Tumblin' Dice...It has the excellent confessional Mick songs like \\"shine a Light' and 'I just want to see His face'...DURING THIS PHASE THE STONES WERE HAVING LOTS O' PROBLEMS...and this album releases the tension and reveals just about all in the Stones drama...it brings back alot of memories, this fine album ...but alot of people feel it drags and does not rock with Sticky Fingers and Let it Bleed...I DISAGREE...I LIKE TO KICK BACK AND LISTEN TO THIS...ITS GOT THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY,...IT REALLY REALLY 'ISN'T' THE STONES' WHITE ALBUM AT ALL...IT IS SOMETHING ELSE INDEED---FIVE STARS...

B00006878K|5.0|This 1967 LP is the most famous of all Albert King's albums, and <br />with good reason. These 11 songs (issued as singles before) feature Albert at his best, and the backing group is also great-it's Booker T & The MG's. You get slow blues with great soloing by Mr. King (Personal Manager), faster numbers (Crosscut saw and Hunter to name a few) as well as some jazzier ballads, showcasing Albert's singing abilities (The Very Thought Of You, I almost Lost My Mind) <br />Now, to prove how influential this record was, let's name just few artists to cover some of these songs <br />As The Years Go Passing By - Gary Moore, Carlos Santana, Jeff Healey, Booker T & The MG's (they wrote it for Albert and later recorded it as an instrumental) <br />Oh, Pretty Woman - Gary Moore, John Mayall's Bluesbrakers <br />Hunter - Free <br />Definitely recomended.
