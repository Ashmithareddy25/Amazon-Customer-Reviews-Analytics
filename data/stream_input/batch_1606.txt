B007J4T2G8|5.0|Omg!!! This is such an amazing book. Christian Grey is such an phenomenal character. The author was very detailed and made the story line so amazing
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I've played both the android and iOS versions, and this one is a little disappointing. I've reached every achievement, and now, there's nothing else to do. in the iOS version, there's a nifty garden section which is sorely missing from the android app.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|I have all of the serius and I love them all this was a continuation of the serious and it was the best so far.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is probably one of the best cds that I've heard in a long time. I can't remember the last time I've been able to listen to a cd all the way from beginning to end without skipping any songs. This is one that has been on my playlist for months, and I'm still not tired of it. Great job guys.
B008BIZ06M|1.0|Been a huge fan of Offspring since Ignition. Though I am a hardcore metal fan, I always liked the punk style of Offspring. But after Splinter, it's been a fast roll down the hill for the band and this album has cemented the fact they have hit rock bottom. Only 'Hurting as you' shows shades of the old glory. All songs are extremely poppish and to my horror, OC guns song has hints of reggae and some DJ type disc scratching!!! I hope their next album (if they ever plan to release one) tries to get back to their roots. I was planning to catch their show on October 5th and the Palladium but I am dreading whether the majority setlist would be smudged with songs from this album!
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|Helen Mirren is flawless. I have to believe that Cromwell represents a crusty side of Prince Phillip that most of us in USA don't know about, and that Diana was so beloved of the British. A remarkable movie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I had read a lot of bad reviews on the triology but still decided to buy it check it out for myself and I don't regret it. Although it had some repeated lines that weren't necessary but I have enjoyed the first two parts can't wait to purchase the third part. It had funny, sad, sexy, a little bit of everything. Good books.
B008BRC6NS|4.0|i love Jlo's music so this album to me is great but i was just a little disappointed that louboutins ,fresh out the oven, im gonna be alright, hold it dont drop it, both (original versions) of im real and aint it funny, hold you down, no me ames, play,im glad were not included on this compilation other than that this is a GOOD HITS album :)
B008602KQI|1.0|To begin with, I had not read the book even though I had purchased it some time ago.  Several of my much younger friends, 12-25 years old, had suggested it after knowing I had read and seen all of the TWILIGHT series.  The HUNGER GAMES is in no way anything like the TWILIGHT series.  Twilight is all about fiction and not a premonition of what the world could be in years to come.  The idea of killing people for national entertainment is beyond disturbing, and even more disturbing is that this type of material is watched and enjoyed by people.  The violence is not so much what is on the screen but rather the implied violence.  Donald Sutherland does an outstanding job representing inhumanity. I was offended by the material and very sorry that I spent the money for it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just really love all these books! Its such an escape from reality coul dnot be happier with the turn out. I am 50% don with this book and I dont want it to end.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I LOVED THE MANY TWIST AND TURNS THIS BOOK HAD. EXCELLANT!THIS BOOK FROM START TO FINISH JUST KEPT YOU READING I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN. LOVED THE ENDING
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this site!!!!  this app makes it so convenient to jump right in.  So many neat tips and diy things to try.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a very sad story, but excellently written. I am a high school English teacher, and after 16 years, I believe John Green writes teenagers as well as any author. Augustus's development reminds me of Alaska and Margo in \\"Looking for Alaska\\" and \\"Paper Towns\\" respectively. I enjoyed the story and the character development. If you like John Green or any YA fiction, pick this one up.
B005LAIGQE|5.0|Like the old Ned Land (20,000 Leagues Under tyhe Sea) song \\"It's a whale of a tail and its all true\\", this film was delightful!  A good story with a better than expected cast.  I also enjoyed the extras that came with the film; great for a family night movie with the kids.
0446573027|4.0|this book was better than at least the last five lee child books. i liked old puller but he's not up to reacher just yet. but give lee child time and he will make it happen. like to see another puller book.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|It's a clever story that triggers one interest in wanting to know what's coming next. Although it covers the classic characters like, witches, vampires and daemons, the approach to these well known characters-type are new and thus surprising. The reader don't know beforehand what will happen next in the story, because of the unpredictability aspects of it.
B000SW2F6C|2.0|I was disappointed with the quality of the download and the amount of time I had to wait for the episode to buffer and catch up to itself.  Very disappointed and will look elsewhere to watch more episodes.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice break from politics....sort of....Calmly find the path..nice reward solving the problems. ...  Just like. politico ....  ha ha ha.  ha
B0086HGW42|5.0|Ed sheeran is the sooo good. well worth the buy. downloading was very fast and easy. couldnt wait for the personal cd copy so i had to download it off amazon!
B0049IWQJW|5.0|This is one of the best movies for children in recent history. I think it is a toss-up with Monsters Inc. Well thought out, clean, moral and just plain funny with a very good lesson for children to learn about selfishness...Highly recommended! The sequel, in my opinion is an embarassment to this great movie.<br /><br />Mike
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good story line but my god every page had detailed sex scene.  Is it possible to have sex as many times in a 24 hr period?  I hope not
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mark Owen has written, with help, a good, high speed ride with this book. If you want a book that will take you for a ride and deliver you to the destination of the informed--then No Easy Day is spooling up and has a spare spot for you.<br /><br />Mark did not tell one secret or let the camel nose under the Spec OPS tent flap. My opinion.<br /><br />Thank you Mark-- for writting a good book, having the courage to be an operator and for loving your country. I wish you had of gotten your Beer from Obama. If I was the President we all would have had one hell of a Bar B Q and would call ol Bush over to help. Strong Men can afford to be gentle. Just remember your a Paratrooper and a pretty good snake eater for a squid.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This unusual snapshot of history is written in letters instead of chapters. This format may be confusing at first, but it takes little time to figure out who's who. The correspondence between characters is beautiful, entertaining, and progressive, leading the reader to a satisfying conclusion. Overall, a delightful and informative read! I recommend it for any book club as the potential for discussion is extraordinary. Sadly, this is the only contribution to the literary world by this author; she died before her work reached publication.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Really captivating and imaginitive once it gets going! The characters and setting are extremely appealing! Once of my fav books!
B00785P2QC|5.0|these games are so much fun. and addictive! I cant stop playing the city game. its so easy to do. canyon wait to play a another one of their games
030758836X|1.0|I checked this out from the library, glad I did. After reading the first several pages, I started to skim the book. I had no connection with the characters. They were unbelievable. The plot was like a bad TV show. The ending made me snort and roll my eyes.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I enjoy the Angry Bird games but this by far is my favorite. I keep playing it over and over, didn't enjoy the others that much.<br />Graphics and sounds are fun.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game, with nice art &amp; music! Don't just stop at the simple completion, test yourself, &amp; go for the golds!!
B002BVQU5A|5.0|awesome, delightful acting.  estrogen rich. great script. fun music.  johnny's sweet & fun. everyone in a relationship should watch it once alone & then together & then maybe again every year.
B001DPC4R8|5.0|Great imaging and sonic qualities on this 180-gram vinyl LP.<br />Highs are smooth and crisp with improved low frequency response.<br />The vinyl itself is high quality, and very low on noise.<br />I also like the fact that this LP includes all the original<br />content present on the 1976 LP, including the Eagles poster.<br /><br />I read that this was a good mix-down, but my expectations were exceeded.<br />This will become a collectors item.<br /><br />A wonderful reissue. Grab it while you can.<br /><br />Equipment used:<br />-Rega P7, Rega Exact cartridge<br />-McIntosh C2300 preamp<br />-McIntosh M252 amp<br />-B&W Matrix 801 series 3 speakers
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I think of a movie to be exceptional if you can watch it in any mood.  But, the Hunger Games is a great movie; the only thing is you need to be in the mood to see it.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Loved the movie, wished that I went to see it in theaters would have been worth every dollar. I wish everyone could see this movie, so they could understand what the people in the military sacrifice every day for our protection.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Like most Jane Austen books it is a four way love story however I like the mystery involved in this one more than some of her others.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|What an awesome movie.  I will be seeing Temple Grandin in a few weeks and I wanted to see<br />the movie first.  Please if you want an indepth idea about people with autism,watch this movie.<br /><br />I also got 3 books about her.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Although not the happiest of Jane Austen stories still well worth the read.  I am a big fan of her work!
B0013F1D02|5.0|If you loved Princess Bride you will love Stardust.  It is an incredible movie. Fun and intelligent.  It is well worth your time to watch this show!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I like books 4 and 5 but not as well as 1, 2 and 3. They lack the enthusiastic adventures that were in the other books. To much soap opera and not enough \\"Ice and Fire\\". I hope book 6 brings back the glory and thrills of the first 3.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|Took an already understanding of \\"hard work pays off\\" and dove deep into the depths of what that embodies and kept it very insightful and intriguing.  Very well written.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was not my type of story.  The plot started slow; mid-way through the story improved somewhat and I thought it would become a better read.  However it lost momentum,and came to it's finale and fell flat!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|highly recommend using the tutorial- game play is smooth and  uncomplicated, yet you can't help but want to play more. The music is complelling but does not over power the game. graphics are subtle and beautiful- reflection and Zen inspired. just great all around.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book it was a simple relaxing read with a nice mystery plot. It is a nice view on a different world I didn't find it erotic as much as I found it intriguing and mysterious.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl was a good, anticipating read.  I thought the twist in the middle, when you find out just how crazy someone can actually be... was great. It kept me wanting to read more and more.  The ending was kind of a fizzle... however, if there were a 2nd book to follow, it would make more sense to me.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I'm not sure what the fuss was about sensitive information, but this was a really enthralling book, and well-worth the reading for the history made by these brave men and women. Makes you appreciate their sacrifice and bravery.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Even if you are not a Stephen King fan you will love this book.  Took me on a trip I never expected to go on and loved every minute of it.
B004XIZN5M|4.0|Nice routines for bodyweight exercises you can do almost anywhere. Definitely sets a high bar for strength. Less gymnastics focus than \\"Building the Gymnastics Body\\", of course, but non-gymnasts will be able to do these exercises. Definitely read the follow-on FAQ at Dragon Door:   [...]
B006OOHYIC|5.0|LOVE IT!!!! makes your brain work and it helps me too relax i just plain love it!! and i also love how they give you the chance to see hints if you are stumped!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not much else to say, just read this. I haven't liked a book this much since Snowcrash. Reads quick and smooth, characters are well developed and easy to love, or hate. It's really great to see an author writing great stuff like this and avoiding the traditional publishing route.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was generally good! I liked that we could read both sides of the story (his and hers)....I expected the end to better but it was worth my money.
B008JH5CVS|5.0|I didn't have any expectation for this movie at all. But it was a really great movie. Guy Pierce is just pure awesome in it, I don't think he was acting at all.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Got this app as the FAOTD but it is well worth its usual cost (.99&cent;). If you, like me, know nothing about this game or the one before it,  basicly the goal is to build structures that support a certain amount of weight and you have certain rules you have to follow to complete each structure correctly. For instance, one doesn't have any attach points, it's free standing and needs to support a certain weight. Sound boring? Surprisingly not so. It very much becomes personal to get to the next level. Overall, this game is a nice change from all the 'pew, pew' games out there. You actually use you're brain!  O.O Oh also,  I have no problems running it on my Kindle Fire.
1609611543|4.0|I was in a store in Seattle trying on clothes and complaining about my belly fat and the clothing clerk said \\"do you mind if I tell you something\\" I said no go ahead! She said have you read the book \\"Wheat Belly\\"? to which I responded no I have not. She then went on to tell me she read it and has lost 35 lbs! So after getting home from my trip I ordered this book on my e-reader. The book was very informative and the scientific content supported his theory however there were some long sections that were sleepy that I skimmed through but the book overall gave me the understanding and tools to decide I really wanted to give it a try. I'm only 4 days in and feel great but time will tell on the results!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Paid 39.99. Came fairly quick. I've always been impressed with the durability of these controllers and you can just tell it is built well. Replacing the same controller that I bought with the system many years ago and had been through hell, but still worked.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoy this game. While I got it as the free app of the day, I would have gladly paid for it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book, I wish that it would have kept going on.  I would recommend this trilogy to anyone.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game me and my son started at the<br />same time we are seeing who can level up the fastest.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It's hard to make this kind of book into a movie since most of what happens is in the main character's mind.  I think they did a pretty good job at translating that over to the big screen though.  There are a few changes that I didn't like as well as a few things that were left out that I thought were important, but overall well done.  If you are a fan of the book, you would enjoy the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome graphics I love playing this game no matter what time it is. it keeps me very busy when I'm bored
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This Stephen King book reminds me of the \\"old\\" Stephen King books that I am familiar with.  Very similar writing style to his earlier works.  I really liked the book...easy read and loved the ending.
B000SX8BXC|5.0|Norah Jones is one of my favorties.  I purchased this albumn from Amazon for just $5.00-great value and worth more.
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was very close to the actual book, which is unusual for a movie from book. I liked the lack of stabalizer in video production. It was more noticeable in the theatre than on my TV screen, but all in all, a great movie. Catnis is deffinately a well developed character, and was cast and played well. Even Peta, while not as I had imagined him in my mind, was cast and played to perfection!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a most amazing picture. Catniss Everdeen seems like a clever survivor but she is much more than that.  She has a heart determined to save her sister and protect her family from the Capitol's fierce and blatant use of young adults as gladiators in a no win  contest. Only one player can win and she doesn't want to play their game but is forced to comply because of the Capitols technology.<br />Even though she attempts to save a young girl from another district in the end it is for nothing or maybe it isn't.  Her determination caused riots in some of the other districts run and ruled by the Capitol.  The winners of a nuclear war which devastated the world 74 years ago,the Capitol is cruel, selfish and cares nothing for the districts who lost. They dine on the best of food, wear outrageous costumes and only care for their own entertainment.<br /><br />\\"May the odds be ever in your favor\\" as you watch Catniss destroy the game for the Capitol.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|If you're reading  book three, then you already know that the series is fabulous.  Book three is my favorite of the series (I'm in the middle of book five now), by far!  Many loose ends are tied up, tons of action and no slow parts. I can't say that I'm happy with what happens in the story, but the writing, plot, flow, etc. are as good as ever.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like cuz I can use it for school.Plus I really improved in my math. that's why I really love it. :)
1468161660|5.0|I really liked this book! Very well written and it kept me wanting to read more. I look forward to the next book by Colleen Hoover.
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|It was a movie that you didn't want to miss a second of it. Super intense. The ending was a surprise.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie had an incredible message and my kids love it.  We watched it after we read the book, and it provided an incredible ending that the book did not do.  We are very pleased.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My friends and I really love this game! We crack up at each others guesses. Love the way the app shows you their guesses and allows you to see as they draw their pictures. I would recommend this to anyone!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I had to get this set as all my grandchildren read it & wouldn't stop taking about it - I finished the series in a couple of weeks! Loved it!!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Downloaded this APP and the whole family loves it! Great idea for school kids, college level students and moms and dads. :)
B0031RS542|5.0|I could not put it down it was very interesting and I could not wait to get to the end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love the strategy and tough thinking that comes with doing the harder levels.  Love exercising the brain! Great way for it to stay fit! ;)
B008FC4WA4|5.0|I was first turned onto Nick Hornby with \\"High Fidelity.\\" His writing is funny without being jokey and his characters always have a wonderful truth to them. Although \\"Bastard\\" was much too short (that is the nature of the \\"Single,\\") I enjoyed this little snippet. Bastard is funny and brisk. And leaves you wanting much more. I secretly wonder if the people in Hornby's life have felt THEIR lives have been put on display and he decided to turn it back around and onto to himself. If you like Nick, you'll enjoy this little treat.
B008KL2ITW|3.0|Before I purchased this book I came back to the synopsis a few times as I wasn't sure if it would be for me.  Eventually I caved in and got it and can say I did enjoy it.  Some of the storyline went a bit OTT at times but still kept my interest until the end.  If you're looking for a quick, enjoyable read this book will fit the bill.
B002RLBKPO|4.0|I happen to be in a Kurt Vonnegut stage a few years back and was reading through his more famous books when I came upon this one. I think this is one of those little surprises in his career. Much as Vonnegut's work is this wonderful mix of sadness and humor, pain and suffering with a sprinkling of depressing . I can only say this about Deadeye Dick. There are moments, sentences, coincidences in this book that I remember years later, when I've forgotten many of the specifics of his better known (and for me 5 star) books. It's because of those moments, those things that stay with you, that I recommend this book.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it! Unable to put it down. Much better written, with a better plot than the \\"Fifty Shades Trilogy\\" I look forward to reading the next in the series. Sylvia puts it down and out there. Extremely sensual with relatability.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm only half way through it, but can't put it down (except to write this review!). Best I've read in a long time.
B008602KQI|4.0|After reading the Hunger Games book, I was so excited for the movie.  It was excellent, but not quite up to par with the book.  There were several changes, but I also understand some of them were in order to keep the movie as first person viewpoint as possible and provide us with insight from Katniss' head that we should not have otherwise understood.  The actual events in the Games were pretty true to the book.  However, I thought the relationship between Katniss and Peeta was totally underplayed and have heard comments from people who haven't read the book about the confusion over how Katniss feels about Peeta.  Overall, a good movie and I'm glad to own it!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|Out of the trilogy movies Batman Begins is the worst, but that's actually not a bad thing, in fact the movie is great and entertaining (not to mention that it is as dark as the movie could get which is what I enjoyed).
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Not my favorite story. Characters could not communicate. Just spent the whole book fighting and hurting each other. It got boring.
1401227821|5.0|I loved everything about this art book. I loved the fact that Mr. Hughes explained how some of the covers came to be and a lot of the back and forth that went between him and the editor. It was really interesting to see the discarded ideas as well as the different sketches that went into creating the final product. I've never bought an art book before that actually explained in detail the thoughts of the artist so this was really refreshing and informative. And oh, the art was absolutely beautiful, of course. High quality printing and great layout. Loved it!
B008602KQI|5.0|Sure the movie is not exactly like the book, which I loved, but there are elements to the movie that imagine things that could have happened but we didn't get to learn about in the book because it was from one point of view. This is what I like most about books that become movies. I have found that I really enjoy seeing the things that weren't in the books and look for those things in the movies. It is also cool to see how others interpret the characters and scenes. Sure, I still have my own visions of how it all played out and how the characters looked, but I still love the movie and the movie maker's take on the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow, is all I can say !  This book is a fast and sensual read would like to see a sequel to book three.  How this lifestyle would effect a family life.
B00136LZG8|5.0|I had this vinyl when it was good. I also had it in the 8 track.  So as you can see the years that have passed which shows how my desire for this album has expanded.  Today as you can see we have it on Mp3.  After so many years, I lost the album as well as the 8 track.  I just so happen to find it in your inventory, then, i had to get it.  This brought back many memories.  I thank you very much for aquiring this album.<br />  Sincerely,<br />  Francisco K. San Jose<br />  aka  atomicpoidog
030746363X|5.0|I received this book on time and in excellent condition.  I thought I was buying a diet and recipe book.  The book is actually a blue print for a healthy body.  It contains information on all kinds of exercise and health oriented topics.  As for the diet, unlike the typical diet book, it gives a general outline in not so many pages and leaves you to come up with your own combinations of the allowed foods.  My adult children have tried this diet and love the energy and weight loss it has brought, as well as the fun of the one binge day per week.  My husband and I are planning on starting this diet next week. Even without the menu advice, this book is well worth the purchase price and a good read.<br />M M
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This APP does what I need - reminds me so that I won't be late.  Very pleased!  I use the monthly reminder most of all.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Good movie very funny for kids and adults, I was having a a ruff day and sat down with the boy friend to watch a movie. We had a great time i felt cheered up after watching it. If you do not like westerns and have not sense of humor do not watch it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the Fifty Shades of Gray book was great but Fifty Shades Darker was even better!  It seemed to delve more into the emotions of Ana and Christian and really added dimension to their relationship aside from the S&M.  I couldn't put it down!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool 1-5 spins a truly fresh vision of a human society slowly coming to understand and resist the dead hand of the past. Plus, it's a page-turner!
B005EWDAFQ|5.0|The fear of failure or success pervades every page of The Fear Index by Robert Harris who brings the world of Hedge Funds and computer wizardry vividly to life for those of us who lurk in the amateur world of indifference. In a compelling and dramatic story of a brilliant scientist who turns hie skills to inventing a incorruptible virus system that makes him and his company millions almost by the day, the author opens the pages on the geeks and professionals who people the world of money and reveals Dr Alexander Hoffman's true character when he is plagued by a mysterious other self who not only burgles the doctor's burglar proof mansion but also haunts him by delivering expensive gifts such as an antique Charles Darwin book and other goodies, all, it is revealed, bought by someone purporting to be Hoffman. Twists and turns race through the pages with electric speed to such an extent that Hoffman begins to fear for his sanity. He discovers that his own headquarters and his office are bug filled with spy devices and is amazed to discover the he, it seems, ordered the spy devices to be installed, according to his security chief. The virus he invented and installed to monopolize his tremendously successful Hedge Fund inevitably begins to take risks that results in Stock Market red screens and it begins to looks as though bankruptcy is the only option.Intrigue, murder and psychological warfare are the main ingredients in this splendidly  crafted and plotted story of video conference calls, electronic security,all put together with adroit mastery of the subject.Questions arise with some episodes that stretch the imagination yet it is hard to deny that The Fear Index is a greatread.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book was a very fast read. It moved along very well. The characters were developed very well. The story was great. I would recommend the book to a friend. I read 50 Shades of Gray and I am looking forward to the third book in the trilogy.
B001OGRQAQ|5.0|Of the many albums in the history of popular music that have gone on to become classics, I would have to say that this one has proven to be one of the most unique and exotic ones. The Talking Heads have always stood out as being a one-of-a-kind gem from the late 1970s thorugh the mid 1980s as proven by their avante-garde style, taking on one form or another.<br /><br />From the memorable classics such as \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" and \\"Crosseyed And Painless\\" to the strange, yet highly improvised works of art such as \\"The Great Curve\\" and \\"The Overload,\\" this album ushers in the 1980s in an eclectic way not matched by many others. Sure, some of the stuff the Heads did with this album is outright strange, but in a way that makes the listener think and wonder about what sort of message David Byrne is conveying. After all, that is the beauty of music, right? The lyrics obviously had a lot of thought and sophistication put into them, which is not what you really see in much of today's mainstream garbage. Such is especially the case with the classic \\"Once In A Lifetime\\" which can really make people think about what the future has in store for them.<br /><br />Overall, if you really want to hear the Talking Heads in the prime of their career and the epitome of their variety, please pick up this album. It is a must, no questions asked. Given the horrible state of mainstream \\"music\\" in today's world, there sadly may never be another band quite like the Talking Heads, but at least we have albums like this to remind us of the glory days of popular culture, when America had what could be called CLASS, and when the music on the charts actually had significant artistic value.<br /><br />BUY IT!!!
B008B3F38C|4.0|Beautiful voice, one that has a haunting lure. Not a big fan of the gutteral vocals, but this was done well. It is used in an underlying of some of the songs. Good record and worth the time to listen to.
B004FHP9KA|2.0|I rented this movie without even realizing that I had already rented it previously. It wasn't until I started remembering some of the scenes when I had realized I had already seen it. I guess that sums up about how much I was impressed by the movie. Thought it is an interesting storyline, I thought the movie to be boring and too drawn out. I must have fell asleep through half the movie the first time I saw it. Save yourself some time. If you're going to watch it, watch just the beginning, then skip to the end. You really don't need the rest of the movie.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|Great record... Little hints of Axel in Myles' voice on a number of songs. Well worth listening to over and over again. Even if you were not a G&R fan, this record should be heard by all.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Though I would not purchase this movie after renting, I would consider renting it again. Great action and story from the beginning and I found it to be entertaining. If there is only one part I didn't care for, it would have been the ending. However, I can also see why the writers would end it this way.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It's hard to described or review this book. It is one of the best books I have read and I will read it again. There is so much to this book that in order to fully comprehend all of it, I have to read it again. Awesome book Chris. Thank you for your service in protecting our freedom.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was sooooooo excited to have gotten my pre-order the day they were released in stores.  Every time I hear music from the movie, I want to see the movie over and over!  The BluRay/DVD+Ultraviolet copy that I preordered was awesome!!!  I don't always enjoy special features discs that come with sets like this but the special features in this set were well put together and did not bore me.  In fact, I enjoyed learning some of the behind the scenes secrets of the making of this movie.  And mind you, that did NOT spoil the fun of watching the movie at all.  This is one of the best movie BluRay/DVD sets I have ever purchased!<br />[[ASIN:B0084IG7KC The Hunger Games [2-Disc Blu-ray + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B000S559VW|4.0|Classic Pixies album is one of my favorites!!! there are a few rarities that are on this album that you can't find anywhere else.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|At first I was concerned about the lack of ethernet connectivity that the MacBook Pro with Retina display has since my house has poor WiFi connections due to the walls.  However, I was using the ethernet adapter on my 13'' MBP and wanted to continue to use it with the MBPr.  I bought this adapter at BestBuy since it was the same price as on Amazon and I needed it immediately.  While the $30 price tag is very steep for a cable, you get the quality of an Apple product and the ability to use one of your Thunderbolt ports, which you probably have free anyway unless you're usinng a Thunderbolt display or external storage device.<br /><br />If you need a hard wired ethernet connection for your MacBook Air or MacBook Pro Retina, it's worth the extra money to get the Apple product that works!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great way to stay organised! fun possibilities are endless. Have the feeling of having past.present. and future in order. The dream is on with pinterest! Make your board happen learn create fun!
B006ATJXQW|3.0|Didn't answer as many questions as I hoped. Good read altogether but not the best of the maze runner series.
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! I wanted this movie on dvd when it came out, but I was heading for college and did not want to overload myself packing. When I found that I could download it from amazon I was excited and downloaded it right away! It's great quality in the movie and I love that I can exit out of the window, even shut down my computer and it would resume at the spot I left off at. ALl in all a great movie!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|You should really read all 3 books to understand how Christian Grey started out in life and how he ended up. After I finished the last book, I wanted to start all over again in reading book 1 again because it made me feel so good. If the author wrote another book that continued where book 3 left off, I would get it also because it was heart warming and well written.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very good. It is for adults only or for mature readers only. This book  introduces new ideas of how people can explore in their sex lives. This is a book you don't want to put down. You always want to know what is going to happen next with Mr. grey's constant mood swings. I highly recommend this book, but as said to mature readers only.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater and still love it ten views later. The picture quality on the purchase is great to. Definetly satisfied
B006LSZECO|3.0|This novel was a bit bizarre for my taste in reading material.  It is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" story.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|When mankind comes out of rehab Dr Max Gerson will be reconized as the Father of true healing...<br />This book not only explains the Gerson Therapy but the underline biochemistry that proves the efficiecy of the therapy in terms easy to understand for most people.<br />For any of You interested on non-alleopathic medicine this book is a must read.<br />Sincerely,<br />Liberybell
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Tremendous insight into the good, bad and the ugly of the life of slaves on a Virginia plantation around 1800.  Kathleen Grissom has a captivating writing style.
0307292134|5.0|Since there are thousands of Game of Thrones reviews, I would like to write only about the Bantam edition. This is a irresistible product for a books' fan like me. Of course paperback is cheaper but the extra price pays for a high quality edition that will catch the eye in any bookshelf. George Martin's fantastic saga deserves to be read in such splendid books.
B001O37H1C|5.0|Great sound, and just fun to listen too and dance too.  This album is just as good not as when it first released
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am very happy that there are finally apps for android. Pinning is so easy.<br />4 stars because there is always room to improve. Love pinning!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love to play this game! Except for the buffalo stampedes and dysentary....I could do without those. Makes it interesting though :)
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Even though it took a little bit to give the background to get the story line going it was a brilliant book even without the sensual parts.  The story line was very good and held my interest until the last word of the book after the slow warm up.  Great book!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The novel was like no other I have ever read.  It's stories were well developed but punctuated by three other stories before resuming where they had left off in the wake of the others.  Thru all of this the stories characters and incidents were connected via hints of re-incarnation and time.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It was somewhat difficult \\"getting\\" into but once you were hooked, it was full steam ahead.  Overall, a smart book that left you thinking and imagining  the many twists of fate that each of us go thru in our lives' journeys.  A solid 4 thumbs up.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest is an exciting read with lots of action and memorable characters. A thoroughly entertaining book.
B00772M1F6|5.0|LOVE this!  I listen to all sorts of stuff - primarily indie, garage, rockabilly, and some oddball country - and this is hands down my new favorite album.  Listen to it all at once, the way it should be heard, and I dare you not to dance. Saw them play on the Conan O'Brien show & they are just as good live.  Great job guys! This is my next vinyl purchase without a doubt.
0671646788|5.0|This book by David J. Schwartz, Ph.D. written I think in about 1959 is still as relevant today as it was then. A must for all people who want to get ahead in life wether in business or working for others. Business leaders in particular should buy multiple copies to hand to their staff, in my opinion it could be the kindest gift you could ever give an employee. For those who are wondering what working and family life is all about here it is presented in an easy to read format (no bull-dust) with blueprints built in to show you how to get to your successful and happy life.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie, quite possibly the best movie of the whole year that doesn't have a Stan Lee cameo in it
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved It! One of my favorite movie! I can wait till the next one comes out. With this movie you don't need to read the book to understand the movie, but you're missing out if you don't read the books.
B008602KQI|5.0|Movie was awesome!  Made those of us that had not read the books, read them all.<br /><br />My daughter's input is:  left a few things out like the mayor's daughter giving the pin to Katniss other than that it was awesome!<br /><br />Looking forward to Part 2!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest,  and this app is great when it works. Sometimes there will be a few hiccups where the site will not work. And its not my connection on my kindle because other apps work just fine. Overall its great.
034580404X|5.0|I had to read it twice! I read all three books in about 4 days, and yes I read them twice! I couldn't put them down! HBO needs a miniseries on this!
B004UID2LC|4.0|I downloaded FREEdi YoutTube Downloader because I needed to be able to play a YouTube video when I go camping in a few weeks.  I'm not sure if they would have WiFi access in the woods.  I've downloaded a few videos and I've been playing around with it, downloading videos and making sure it works.<br /><br />It works pretty well.  The only problem I ran into is I can't just type in the code or web address of the video, I have to search via the search function.  There were a lot of videos with the same name as the one I wanted, so that was hard.<br /><br />A tip for those who want to go to their own channel: Go to \\"Settings\\" on the bottom menu and input your channel name on YouTube.  Go back and look at the \\"Channels\\" selection on the bottom of the screen.  If you don't see it, pick \\"Today.\\"  You should see \\"Channels.\\"  Once in \\"Channels,\\" you can see your subscriptions and the videos you've uploaded to YouTube.<br /><br />After I did that, I was able to see all the videos I've uploaded to my account.  For some reason, I still can't get my subscriptions to load.
B0039USJMY|5.0|An excelent film of Vjctoria aqnd Albert and theirb importance in Britis History ande that  impact in the world. they gave aq vision of are the rights  of laborrers.  A vision for educarion and thev equality of all people- housing, medical care, working condition. A five vstar film and cast,
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I simply couldnt put this series down.  I enjoyed every moment and would gladly read more of these books.  The characters kept you rooting for each one in different ways.  Not at all like I thought it would be!
B001R59KR6|5.0|A very human story about why a person gwrs involved in espionage and resistence. The castb well chosen and thev story excellent
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, that's all I can say.  I couldnt put the book down once I started reading.  Cant wait for the second book!  Hopefully it's half as good as this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Read all three! Great books! Easy read that you can't put down!  Highly recommend!  Great mix of action and romance.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the second installment of this series.  Kept you guessing yet not boring. would love to see more of these in the future.
B007SGM084|4.0|It started off kind of off the chain.  Thought it was going to be bizare  all the way to the end, but since I had already purchased the triology, I finished all 3 books.  It was a really good book. The more I read it, the more I wanted to know more details.  It is a very interesting book.  I highly recommend it.
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|I am not one to own a voluminous library of movies, however, W.E. by Madonna was such a beautiful movie, I couldn't wait to own it!  The cinema-photography in W.E. and the music score is academy award worthy! This was such a wonderfully written movie portraying one of the greatest love stories from a myriad of personal perspectives and also provides the viewer with a current parallel love story.  Love is always a timeless theme that every generation can relate to.
B007OV9EYG|4.0|Plot is a little off as they usually are in this kind of movie. But overall good. But the Lorax was a little lame as a character, with little power display or influence. I'm not a big musical person but luckily that was kept to a min. here. Overall good movie my 2yr duaghter liked watching it for as long as she can watch anything. Later I think she will like it and it teachs children the importance of trees. 4 stars just lacked something. Would have liked to seen the fish more they were one of the best parts in the movie.
B00846REIS|1.0|This was a very poor imitation of Shades of Gray.  The style of writing didn't compare and story line was often abrupt.  When reading this book you could see the obvious attempt to mimic Shades of Gray, but it does not possess the same level of writing skill.  I won't be reading the sequals.
B005LAIHHC|3.0|I rented it from Redbox thank goodness. It was mildly funny in parts, and other parts where like WTH? I never saw Borat or that other stupid movie. But this one I thought looked funny in previews. It is like I said in parts but over all not so great. I wouldn't buy it or own it for sure, maybe rent it if I had seen everything else with nothing else to rent (which was my case).
B008VIKLWA|5.0|The quality of the movie was amazing. I loved the story that was presented. I watched this movie with the entire family and we were all laughing, crying and feeling the love. This is a beautiful story to watch with kids.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Good movie, with a okay plot. Lets face it time travel isn't to far off from the rest of the movie franchise so WHY NOT? Good story line, good characters, good action, nice effects, etc. Would see it again, and will buy it on blue ray when the trilogy comes out :-)
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Enjoyed the book immensely.  It touched many emotions...laughter and tears.... Isnt that what life is all about?  A  One...in my book
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Good move with all the elements in it for action, love, betrayal, suspense, and sequel ending. However the plot in general left major holes. 12 districts that rebeled against ???  I can't even remember it was so light with no real meaning. Now the districts are basically slave labor for the primary civilization which has extremely advanced technology over the 12 districts which look like they are living in the late 1800's to early 1900's. While the primary group is living in the year 3000 technology. But yet when a riot breaks out they use water cannons instead of future tech stun guns or weapons? Did I miss something? Also why did none of the warriors I'll call them just follow the parachutes bringing items from sponsors? They make a loud noise so everyone can find them? Also sponsors of what? The movie was good for action and so on, but don't be expecting some great story or plot it just isn't there.
B008602KQI|3.0|This one just doesn't do it.It seems like something is missing or not flowing correctly. The ending went no where. Maybe I was just looking for to much after all the talk on the tube.
B005LAII08|5.0|Great cartoon flick, with action, adventure, parenting issues, child issues, and real life drama made a little more interesting. Story was good even if magic was involved. But if you like cartoon movies and your children do this will be a good one. I will purchase it for my daughter soon.
B008602KQI|1.0|I think Hollywood doesn't get it. This is a terrible Movie!!!!!<br />I think the old movies are much better than this new Hollywood
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Well plot aside it was a great movie. All the heros are there even the future Hawkeye I believe in the shield agent with the bow. The plot can be a little much for some people. But if you followed the Thor movie and the different worlds and so forth it makes sense. IronMan rocks no matter what and so does Captain America, not sure I liked the Hulk Dr. B actor but as the Hulk he was cool. Overall great movie I preordered it and can't wait to watch it with my daughter in another year or two when she can watch a long movie (2yr olds loose interest quick).
B008602KQI|5.0|i love this movie. It gets better and better everytime i watch it. I cant get enough! Im sure you will get the same kind of satisfaction.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Great book, and great ending to the twilight saga. Easy to buy and download using the kindle ap on my iPad.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|love this game. it kept me up at night because I didn't want to stop playing. so glad I got it for free. :)
B006RUJST6|3.0|It was a book I could easily have done without but matbe that has something to do with my age group.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read!  A true page turner!  Make sure you read the first book in the series...Fifty Shades of Grey as this is the second book in the series.  I am on the third book and will be so sad when I am done with the series.  What will I read next?
B008EL4YX6|4.0|I enjoyed Ichi because it's unique and makes me think on every level.  The higher levels are quite tricky.  You have to be quick or you lose your ball and have to start over.
B006TVQU6C|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />USB 3.0 front ports + an adapter if your MB doesn't have a 3.0 header (to me this is essential for a new case purchase)<br />Lots of fans options (I am using 4 out of the 5 options) 120mm Front, Bottom, Side, Rear, Top.  140mm option on bottom<br />2 included case fans<br />Room for cable management + Bowed out sides<br />2 X 2.5 inch adapters for SSDs<br />Painted on the inside<br />Tool Less installation for drives is easy and not flimsy<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />One small one, the bottom case fan is about 1/2 inch from my power supply.  I couldn't use it because the cables coming out of the PSU were too close.  Not a real big deal though as I was able to use the other 4.<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br /><br />For the price this case met all the needs I had and comes from a trusted brand.  The included fans are ok, but don't move a ton of air.  I upgraded from one of the dirt cheap Rosewill cases and am pleased with what I got for not much more.  I couldn't see paying 70-200 dollars for a case that basically has the same features.  I would/will recommend this case to anyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, cannot wait to read the rest of the trilogy.  I love books that can really make you imagine very vividly a different world.  I watched the movie, but it just didn't do the book justice.
B007SGM084|4.0|I'm not quite done with this trilogy, but so far, it's enjoyable reading.  I usually don't go in for bondage and submissive type sex reading, but this book is done with taste and is an easy read.  I only bought it, as everyone else was reading it...glad I did.  Some have called it \\"granny porn\\"...could be, since I'm 70 and enjoy reading it!  Starting the last book today.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This was free and for me has been so much fun to play. The music is relaxing the graphics are lovely, the puzzles are interesting &amp; if you get stuck there are free youtube videos posted by the company to keep you moving along. My kind of game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|As an avid console gamer for over 20 years, most of the &quot;games&quot; for the Kindle Fire, in my opinion, aren't worth the bandwidth used to download. The zero depth, Farmville-style Facebook crap made to hook bored moms and teens with too much free time, that populate mobile gaming, are a shameless pox on the industry. This is one of two games on Fire that I've found, that has the depth and feel of a real &quot;gamer's game&quot; (the other being Clockwork Knight). These guys really seem to appreciate the craft of gamemaking. Well done.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Completely enjoyed this book.  Not because it is entertaining...but because it provides you with critical information about yourself that you can work with and gain a competitive advantage in all aspects of your life.  You will not be bored! trust me.<br /><br />-Walt F.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an incredible novel. I loved the story and how realistic and moving it was. The main character, Charlie, is the kind of character that is easy love. The rest of the wallflowers are also very well-written, and interesting. I felt a really strong connection to this story and recommend it whole-heartedly.
0345803485|1.0|I thought I was really going to enjoy the book, but I can't force myself to read another page at halfway through. The plot is extremely slow and the author's repetition of certain words and phrases (inner goddess, subconscious, lip biting, mean machine) is distracting at first and become just plain annoying after further reading.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Typical Stephen King writing...too predictable but overall good read.  He is still my favorite author and will continue to purchase anything he writes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I downloaded this when it was the FAOTD. I find it to be extremely useful. I like that it indicates how much battery life is left for different functions, such as reading, playing games, listening to music or watching videos. I can even approximate, by looking at the graph, how much longer it needs to charge to be at 100%.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book kept me right in the book and on every page.  I will get this author books again!!
0307730697|5.0|This was a monthly selection in our book club. It was an easy read & very informative. I highly recommend it. I am not a fan of non-fiction, but this story is one that I was glad to have read. The author researched and interviewed people with great care to present a truthful picture of this young man, his experiences, his family and their lives. I have a new appreciation for what the Navy requires of these young men to be Seals.  A real eye-opener for me! We had a great discussion over this book! Thank you to all the men and women that serve and protect our freedom and this wonderful country!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I like the functionality of this app it actually incorperates the pictures on my fire which is nice. Also it is just fun to see what other people are interested in.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I like the way the romance was building slowly between the two although I question his motives: why wait to consumate a marriage? He was quick to come to her rescue whenever she was in trouble or even if she just felt faint.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this . I am soooo a hunger games fan . I also watched the movie . But the books are better .
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The story and animation was great. Beautifull color and special effects great.  I purchased the BLU RAY 3d Version. 3d not good buy the regular BLU RAY or dvd and youcan't go wrong.  Not sorry I bought it and I can play it in 2d and can enjoy it  Mario C
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This was required summer reading for my son.  As our family lived and worked in Sierra Leone and Guinea, I read this too.  It was compelling, horrifying, and ended on an upbeat note.  The voice was real, and the story is undoubtedly true based on my own knowledge of the region.  Take time to understand some of the realities of African war -- both the horrors of the situation and the generosity of many.  This is an unforgettable read.  Then take a look at UNICEF on facebook -- Beah was recently in the Central African Republic, speaking with boy soldiers undergoing rehabilitation.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The story continues to capture your attention!  I really didn't think I would like this series, but the depth of character emotion draws you in and keeps you interested.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|In comparision with the 2 other books, this is a little boring. But i have to know the end of the history....
0525953728|5.0|This book is impossible to put down! It's well written and grabs your attention from the start. I finished it one day. A very detailed description of what these guys do, without releasing any classified material.
B008602KQI|5.0|Cant even explain the perfectness of this movie. I've watched if six times and each time just get more and more into it. The cgi is amazing and hardly noticeable and the overall filming is just perfect. It's like your a captiol member watching the 74th annual HUNGER GAMES!
B002U3CCF6|5.0|What a rare treat to find a book so enticing and rich that I stopped thirty pages in, returned to the beginning and read it slowly from the start again so as to savour every line. As complex and unexpected as a great pinot noir, Sharp Objects had me scooping up all Gillian Flynn's work and may her next be a matter of moments away.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Took a little time to figure it all out but now I have this calendar on my phone and my Kindle Fire and now the calendars are synched together so they alway match.  You can enter events to the Jorte Cloud online but beware that calendar online is glitchy and was showing the dates off by one day including holidays.  HOWEVER those glitches do not carry to the mobile calendars, the calendars on my mobile devices are correct.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|okay I love the game but I cant know how to finish sinking feeling help. when I figure that out I will chang my review.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Books 1 -3 are excellent books and very hard to put down once you start reading them.  The characters in the book are very entertaining!!!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|The characters are well developed and the plot moves along quickly. It's a little hard to keep all of the characters straight while reading on the Kindle, which is not user friendly to go back or to see maps. I found myself wishing I had bought the book so I could reference the families more easily.
B000SW4DV2|4.0|This is a cute little movie. My three year old son loved it. Robin Williams does an excellent narration in this film and there are plenty of funny moments for adults. I think it's a good movie for the whole family to enjoy!
B008POAQS4|5.0|i really like the show suits this episode was very good i would highly recommend this show to anyone who hasn't watched it you won't be disappointed
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read the first four segments of this five part omnibus edition and am half way through the final segment. I have already downloaded the \\"prequel\\" and plan to read it as soon as I am finished with this book. These stories have kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. The author postulates an interesting future (no spoilers here) and keeps it going with twists and turns throughout. Lets just say that it is a fascinating story and worth reading. You will enjoy!
B001VQB25E|5.0|Having worn dozens of bibshorts since they first came out in the late 80's, I can honestly say these are the most comfortable I've ever worn, including Pearl Izumi, Giordana, Desente, and Louis Garneau. Really high quality chamois which makes a huge difference on those 40+ mile rides. The compression lycra leggings improve my metrics by increasing venous return to the heart, thus increasing cardiac output and wattage. Nice subtle details in the stitching behind the thighs which are reflective from behind, inhance safety when pedaling in low ambient light. The shoulder straps are not too wide and stay in place. While I may not be able to outsprint Cavendish or climb like Contador, or for that matter our local Cat 2, in these shorts, I sure as hell feel like I can. I will definitely be getting another pair. As for sizng, a medium fits me like a glove. I am 5'10\\", 160#, with a 32\\" waist.
B00846REIS|2.0|Maybe ok for an afternoon read by the pool but even then I couldn't recommend it, there are lots of better books
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have been following this book for 4 days and so far I have lost 2.8kg(6.1lbs)already and I am absolutely excited. After reading all the facts it made perfect sense so I then endevoured to put it into practise. Having said that I don't suffer from any kind of medical condition(yet,I think I am on my way to Diabetes as it runs in the family) but I do have psoriasis that I think is aggravated by the consumption of wheat and yes I have a big belly with skinny legs. I strongly recommend this book to all who need to lose some weight as well as fix certain medical conditions that are outlined in the book. I have spent a fortune on weight/diet loss equipment pills & potions & yet have had immediate success straight away with just reading & understanding Wheat Belly-how fantastic.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The continuing story from Season 1 begins with World War 1. Great acting and production making you feel like you are watching history unfold. Now I am looking forward to Season 3 to be shown on PBS sometime in January 2013.
B007TMON8M|1.0|it wont download. this stinking app and to all the ppl who like it and got it to download,  you just got lucky.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of those rare stories that will stick in your brain long after you've finished reading it. As I neared the end, trying to predict the outcome I both wanted to rush through it, but hated to have it end. I enjoyed the way it was written, the unusual descriptions of events, and the funky characters. Don't want to give away anything but if I had to come up with a negative it was the ending. I plan to read her first novel right away.
B0090EIILU|1.0|This movie sucks . It's really vulgar and fight ghj JJ jamb hajj JJ JJ Koki Jakob hmmm jamming jkgjm hvnvnmb Hannah.
B008BM9L72|1.0|I bought this for my wife to read after a friend recommended it.  She has found the first book of the trilogy to be boring and skips many of the sex scenes as just a repeat of what went before.  She is told the 2nd book improves.  She is certainly hoping this is the case.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book, it's a must read if you've read the first two. Definitely the best of the trio because it covers all the bases. I loved the ending how there is a part of the story told through Christians perspective!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love to read and i purchased the first book in barnes and noble and one of my friends  recommend me to try it on my tablet and its amazing no more paperbacks
1609611543|5.0|Was a gift for my wife.  She thought the book was worth reading, but a little more extreme than the program(s) she is currently following.  However, she is glad she read it and recommends it to other interested in this subject matter.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Wow!!!!  I loved the whole three(3) books in this series.... they were so engrossing I found it extremely difficult to put them down..... I LIKED book 1 (fifty shades of grey), LOVED book 2 (fifty shades darker) but the best of all was the last book (fifty shades freed) Thanks to my Hubby for downloading the trilogy to my Kindle for our 35th wedding anniversary.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|What a great story. I love books that strech your mind to think what could be such as the hunger games and machted trilogies. This fits right in with those great books maybe even my favorite of all the young adult novle trilogies out right now. I can't wait to read the 3rd one
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't feel there is anything more Amazon can do to improve my experience. Ok, maybe add books I need to get on my e-reader that may not be available right now. Thanks for asking. :-)
B008Y7GPY6|5.0|i am just writing this to boost the rating of this great movie.This is one of the few good ryan reynolds movies
B004O3YGMC|5.0|If you are not tech wizard,I recommend this to you. I've tried many other remote control software and this is the easiest. You should also look into to the chrome remote desktop. It is also the easiest one to use.
1449314287|5.0|this book is an absolute must for anyone who wants to be a mysql expert.<br />it is well organized, better then the 2nd edition, and it covers pretty much everything you need to know. even if in some areas it doesn't go into the fine details of how things work internally, you will understand the concept and how to apply it in real life, as there are many use cases of problems percona encountered and solved.<br />being a third edition, the book is updated on the 2012 database eco system, and i can honestly say, being an independent consultant for many years, that the ROI i got on buying this book is very big number :D
B007BVOF8E|1.0|This is the first one star review I have given.  The acting was ok but the story was horrible, the flow of the movie was terrible and both my wife and I wished we had the 2 hours of our life back.  I kept waiting for it all to come together and it never did.  Take my advice, find something else to watch.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book i read the first one and had it have part two.now i can't wait to get the last book.just couldn't put it down. aries from Balitmore<br /><br />I loved this book could not put it down. I re
B006RUJST6|4.0|Its a book that drew me in. You want to know what happens next and it is an easy read. However, it is probably meant for a younger audience. That said, it still did not stop me from buying the second book.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|So this is up there with the Star Wars set as THE must own title on Blu Ray ever. Avatar? LOTR?? Earth Girls are Easy??? PAH!!!<br /><br />All the CGI in the Galaxy cannot make a movie this perfect ever again.
B0038Z5SEW|4.0|How can you not like a movie starring Anthony Hopkins, a big ole angry Grizzly bear, and beautiful Alaskan wilderness scenery?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a go getter. Once I picked it up, I found it extremely hard and impossible to put it down. I don't normally read but I read this book in one day. I'm now just getting started on the second on. Fifty Shades Darker. It's good as well so far.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I'm an alien and si-fi nut, but this was a concept not normally seen. It was an interesting and action packed movie. I especially liked he extended cut version. I watched it first and then the regular version. It's amazing how much was cut from the regular version. If you get a chance, view the extended version. I originally felt Harrison Ford was not right for the part he played, but after watching the movie twice, I think it was OK and he did a good job. Also, you should view the \\"making of\\" segments offered in the BluRay package, as they were very good. Many of the actors did their on stunts, and some pretty hairy stunts too!
B0075LTOR2|3.0|Roxy Music The Studio LP's<br />Well I received the box set, was pleased with packaging nice job on the box and mini LP sleeves.<br />Then I put the first CD  in my player ,I have just finished redoing my stereo system, new receiver , new cd player , rewired speakers , and added a subwoofer. My normal listening volume for great sound 20-22. I had to turn the volume up to 30-35 on the Roxy CD. What does that tell me POOR MASTERING or no MASTERING. May be from vinyl? I have to do this with a lot of bootleg CD's most are from vinyl. That is ok if that is the only way to get them. But when a major company puts out a 40th anniversary box set I expect more from them. Why go to all the trouble on the packaging and skip over the sound quality? I think I would like it the other way round!! Or both if that is not asking too much?? So please if you are going to sell us something please get it right the first time. We get tired of re buying all our music , just for this reason.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game looks great and the puzzles can be solved on a surface level but then you can go back for more challenges and extra points. Brilliant!
B00632HWOG|1.0|everytime I try to check my mail it says something like re login and check email address. It's all correct and I hadn't been able to check my mail at all. As far as I'm concerned I wouldn't have another kindle.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|As a relic of cold war intelligence community disciplines, I'm not completely comfortable with a tell-all book about a classified mission.  But it's not like it's never been done.  In my opinion, since the blabbermouth-in-chief has already printed bumperstickers and granted his Hollywood buds insider access, no one can fault Matt/Mark for wanting the story told.  The book offers a compelling first-person account of a historic event which was the best chance at retribution Americans could hope for.  I'm glad to know how the op went down.  It had me on the edge of my seat.  Well done.  There is no way any of this is bs because Mark/Matt's team would rain down on him 'like a Georgia thunderstorm'.  I highly recommend you read this before Hollywood version comes out.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I've trained under quite a few workout programs to bulk up for football and rugby with professional help for about 10 years, but after being on the BLS program for 14 weeks I'll never go back. Forget about 2-3 hour workouts 6 days a week! BLS will teach you how to train effectively and efficiently without wearing your body out, as well as how to feed your body the right way. I've never seen my strength increase this quickly, and my workouts have gotten way more enjoyable, not harder or more dreadful. Mike (author) also writes a blog to keep you going after BLS gets you off the ground. He is also available to answer your questions and support you along the way! You'll get way more than what you pay for with this book.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|One of the better faotd. A good solid game while traveling. Progressively more difficult, but not discouraging. Will look for more from this developer.
B007ONSLLQ|3.0|The album before this one was way better... I hope they get away from songs like \\"In Your Room\\" in the future. That song is horrible.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Although it seems to have been written for a younger audience than I expected, I did enjoy this book. I would reccomend it for older teens and young adults over older adults. I did read the next book in the series \\"Point of Retreat\\" and liked it just as well. These books are pretty short, so they are a quick read.
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I love the trilogy of the books and am a big fan, so of course I love this movie. Yes it is a little dark because it is about making these kids killing other kids but it's not gory and its really about so much more than that. It's the beginning of some love stories and also about their government and how things are set up in a future time and it really is just a fantastic storyline. If you haven't seen the movie I would highly recommend to see it! If you have and just want to purchase it I would definitely recommend Amazon. I recieved the movie fast and at a cheaper price than if I were to purchase it anywhere else.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series of books are a real couples pleaser. I read it out loud with my husband and he enjoys it to. These books can really ignite the old flames of desire.

B003PIS5XI|4.0|It's one of my comfy jammie, lotsapillows, feel good movies.  Just a good movie that entertains you but doesn't make you need to keep up with a twisted complicated plot.  I just like the movie.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love this app. I am able to access all of my music in my Cloud Player with just a touch of a button.
1455508977|3.0|It started as maybe just another love story, but you never know if that photo was a lucky charm after all. It kept my interest the entire time. I was so afraid that Thibolt was the one that had died and was about to start crying until the very last when she went back home and Thibolt was there. Fanstic and moving book. Will read again.

I took it to a metal bar and got a few chips in the blade but the come out real quick if you use 1000 grit and 6000 grit Japanese water stone[[ASIN:B0000DD2C9 Woodstock SteeleX D1130 1000 Grit and 6000 Grit Japanese Waterstone]]
B007TMON8M|4.0|Regardless of the &quot;laws of physics&quot; or the internet problems (server having trouble keeping up because it is the FAotD), the game is worth playing.  I have had no problems and I have a Frankenstein system (B&amp;N CM7 Nook Color).  It is fun to play - that simple.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The minute I received the cover for my K-Fire, I loved it.  Easy to place onto the K-Fire, lightweight, doesn't need any breaking in, and is very easy to slip in my bag and run with it.  It would have been nice to have more color choices, but all in all, I love the product!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great read - I couldn't put this book down.  I haven't been that surprised by an ending in a long time.
B008M34CSI|3.0|I thought this would be a better movie then it actually was. I'm glad I got it on sale, otherwise I would have waited for my cable co. To run it
B0086HGW42|5.0|What I love most about Ed Sheeran's music is the originality and smoothness of his voice.  He tells a story through his songs and it's not just a bunch of senseless babbling.
B008CPBB0I|4.0|I wasn't anxious to watch this but after seeing it I'm glad idid. I watch every type of film, I'm pretty easy about it. This is a Great film for the family. It reminded me of some of my favorite Disney films
B008EL4YX6|4.0|Simple, eye appealing, fun and challenging.<br />It has a good learning curve and playing it comes addictive at times.<br />I would totally recommend it for people into puzzle games.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best free dictionary I've found for android or iPhone.  It's fast and works great when playing Words With Friends.
0345525558|4.0|This was a very well written book, and I found that it kept my attention. I particularly liked that the author wove the meanings of the flowers into the plot and the relationships of the characters. Such a unique approach! The main character, Victoria, was so unpredictable, and I found myself becoming an advocate for her even when her behaviors were often so disappointing. I would recommend this book to many of my friends!
B00845PV16|3.0|I like Nick Cage, but this is not the best movie. The plot is very predictable. The thing that makes is ok is the special effects. There are several good chase scenes and explosions.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|i love this movie, i watched it at least 30 times.  it is highly recommended to all ages even a person who is not fan of animations.
0920236162|5.0|This is one of two books purchased for my Great Granddaughter.  She is infatuated with princesses as most little girls are.  She loved this as well as the other book.<br /><br />[....]
B005IQZB14|4.0|This book was recommended in passing by a friend at a dinner party. I found Cheryl's story inspiring and captivating. While not a journey I would normally have on my bucket list, after reading about the author's struggles both on and off the trail I could identify with her and her choices. A good, inspirational story about life, life struggles and the beautiful but challenging outdoors.
B008602KQI|4.0|It's the Hunger Games, what's not to love. If you read the books I'm sure you'll enjoy the movie. That said, the reason for the four star is because of the digital copies. I love the fact that we now have a digital copy in our amazon account. This is great cause we don't have to get up to find the blue-ray disc when wanting to watch it. We can just power on the PS3 or Kindle fire.<br /><br />What bummed me out was the Ultraviolet (uvvu.com) digital copy. We have an Ultraviolet account, in fact we usually look for movies that have the ultraviolet copy.  Our luck has been that we've been able to register the movies via the UVVU.com website & then stream them on our devices using flixster. Well this one requires for you to set up with iTunes or setup a VUDU account in order to add it to your Ultraviolet account. Believe it or not, our media hungry household doesn't use any of those avenues. The last thing I wanted to do was open/create another media account & to have to remember another password.  But if you use iTunes or VUDU I guess you'll be okay.
B00190KZUU|4.0|Love this movie....great story of believing in yourself even when nobody does and great crew of actors besides....BUT..I'm wondering why I had to purchase this for $9.99 when it is old and should have been free being an Amazon Prime customer and credit card holder???  No option to rent it for $1.99 or something reasonable....I did pay it cause we had guests over and they never saw it.  But that is my only complaint being a Prime user.  Otherwise...rent it somewhere else to save money!
B005JR47R6|5.0|<3 House! Funny, and emotional and keeps you on your toes. The only bad part is that it was over!

B00005N6KG|4.0|I love these things.  I need a lightweight pair of headphones with decent sound for when I don't want to wear or tote around a big pair of high quality cans.  I really loathe earbuds (never found a pair that fit well and that didn't seem like they were always about to fall out of my ears) and all of these other newfangled headset designs (Behind-the-neck?  Seriously?).  These things have pretty good sound, are comfortable, and are so cheap that they're practically giving them away.  That's the good news.  The bad news is they have a life span of only a few months of heavy use.  Without fail, audio will go out in one ear or the other, and then it's time for a replacement.  My Amazon order history is littered with entries from purchasing pairs of these.  I've been known to buy two at once, so I'll have one on deck for when the first one starts going out.  Regardless, I'll still keep buying them, because they fit my needs perfectly and are cheap as dirt.
B000UDJS2S|5.0|My two boys loved the movie and my wife thought it was a good movie as well. Action,excitement,and humor what else can you ask for in a  movie
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|This calculater is handy and accessible when I need one.  It is very basic and simple to use.  It keeps me from looking for one anywhere else.
B004EWFUQY|5.0|I started this diet with one of those wonderful Rotisserie Chickens from Sam's.  I ate the whole chicken that day.  Great start, I'd say.  Next day, I ate 4 big grilled burgers.  Yeah...!  By the third day I noted a remarkable decrease in my appetite and really struggled to eat two grilled salmon filets.  I only had 15 pounds I wanted to lose and am already in the cruise phase where I go one day on meats, the next on meats and allowed veggies.  I should be at my goal weight of 123 on 9/15---pretty good since I started only 2 1/2 weeks ago. And the best part is that once I reach my goal, I can anything I want without shame as long as I commit to one day each week to eat meat only.  This diet rocks!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story had so many twists and turns.  Just when you think you have figured out, the plot has another twist. Couldn't put it down
B000I8G5GW|5.0|a cerebral war movie that portrays a time in history that has long been forgotten. it has a psychological twist that is unexpected, and at the end you do not know if the protagonist realizes his psychosis, or accidentally erases the damage he has done to his king and country.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were a great fantasy for any woman to read. I enjoyed every tangled mess they ended up in-in & out of bed!
B008602KQI|2.0|Ok, the movie is alright but the DVD skips an entire scene.  This DVD is not scratched, warped, or altered in any way.  But it skips an entire scene.  We returned it and asked for another disc.  The second one did the same thing.  I don't know how this got through quality control, but you can be sure I'll be reading more customer reviews before purchasing a dvd again.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I loved the story line, a little hard to follow at times. But none the less, a good read!  I wish there was better editing.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is such an easy read - it tells details about the raid on Bin Laden's compound, but it also goes<br />into why the Navy SEALs are the BEST! I used to live in Va. Beach and I can tell you right now that if<br />you saw a real Navy SEAL and not just someone claiming to be one - you would be able to tell the difference<br />right away. This book explains the hard work, determination, and physical demands of these men. It shows<br />insight into why they do what they do. These men don't stand up when it is time to get the glory - but they<br />sure come through when it is time to do the Sh&& kicking!<br /><br />Well worth the money, I wish this author would write more books about his time as a SEAL!
B007T9FRFS|5.0|Reichs continues to write excellent books.  Thoroughly informed on the scientific issues because of her profession, yet able to present them so that the layman can understand them, she manages to tell a good story.  This latest book is as good as any of her previous ones.  Thouroughly recommended.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I kept wanting to read more although I felt melancholy after finishing the book. Many of the sentiments shared by the main character rang true in my own life and in life in general. The author told you ahead of time what was going to happen then would fill in the details. I kept reading to learn the exact detail of how the events unfolded
B008BM9L72|5.0|Mummy porn at its best, it kept me entertained for hours.  There was times I could not stop laughing.  It also had some sad moments but over all a great read by a brilliant author.  I would encourage couples should read it together.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My, my, my, I thought the first book was good.  I see two people that are truly in love, I see more than sex.  I see love conquering mental instability, more than therapy could help.  If every couple, married or not would love this way, this would be a better world.  E. J. James makes you think that you are really there in the book,it's really a page turner.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|Here were these men who rarely left the reservation.  They had been forced to speak English at boarding schools run for the most part by semi-tyrannical teachers and administrators.  They were forbidden their native language, but as God would have it, these children kept it and in the end, as young men, created a code with their language which could not be broken which turned the tide of the war towards us.  Their courage came from being in unfamiliar places among unfamiliar people, and in knowing that the man attached to their hips were there to kill them if they were ever captured.  They persevered. May God bless them and their families forever.  [[ASIN:B000JSI7C6 Windtalkers [Blu-ray]]]
B007L3BMGA|1.0|After all the hype, I relented and brought this book.  Very disappointed, waste of money.  I hoped that the storyline would be more interesting. I was bored.  I just could not get into this book at at all.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I've devoured nearly every S.K. book available and I've always enjoyed his short fiction, since back in the day when \\"Night Shift\\" first arrived on the book stands. In this story, I had some difficulty with the protagonist, \\"Pete\\" who is a preteen boy. Granted each generation of kids are 'growing up' faster, his motivations and inner thought processes seemed a bit out of character for a 10 year old. King has extensively portrayed young, bright precocious boys in his writings and made them believable, but \\"Pete\\" just didn't resonate with me. A couple of times while reading, I was taken out of the story, thinking: \\"Wait a sec, this kid is TEN?\\" It might have helped if King had added one or two years to his age. Unfortunately, I found it easier to believe in the 'featured creature' than the central character, which doesn't happen often in my history of reading Stephen King.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was well written and had me both crying and laughing out loud. My only critism would be that the story line is a bit of a cliche.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I am really impressed by the size of the library Shazam can recognize. Even very rare foreign songs are usually correctly identified. The UI is well streamlined and requires fewer steps to share songs than Soundhound. Currently, Shazam is my favorite music identification app!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Very engaging. Became comfortable wirh the characters right off the bat. Many wiccan beliefs involved. LoVE this book and I love the way it is written. Very enjoyable as well as learning experience.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down once i started reading. It just blows you away. Gale katniss and peeta just something baout that triangle.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it's a really good app. if your on your device a lot, it always alerts you when your battery is low.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book and the series. After watching the movie i had to read this book an dit didn't disappoint.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Although the story is a little far fetched, it is still a great read that I could not put down!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|A well done hidden items game with high production values.  It uses attractive art and a decent array of puzzle types.
B008602KQI|4.0|I made sure I read the book before I saw the move. I pre-ordered the blue-ray, and was eagerly anticipating an awesome movie. The movie was good but not great. The acting was up to par, but it would have been a far better movie if it had stuck to the story line of the book. I'm not implying that the movie needed to be more graphic or violent or depict the nudity or adult situations presented in the book. When you consider all of the press Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince got when it came out in 2009, and that it was not appropriate for children and rated PG. This movie was appropriate at a PG-13, but I think toning it down from the book did the author a disservice. For as long as the movie is, I was disappointed on how much they left out. They should have followed the lead of something like Lord of the Rings and been more true to the series. Hopefully they will step it up for the second film.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a fascinating story and a page-turner.  It was hard to believe that it was non-fiction.<br />It read like a novel!
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This is a wonderful book that shows man's resilience even in times of desperation. Frankl gives a great understanding that happiness is based not on surroundings or circumstances but on personal choice. This is a life changing book that should be in every home.
B008BWPS60|3.0|And yet another television series about the legal profession.  The legal firm in question is a small partnership whose practice is exclusive to rich and powerful corporations or CEOs with the exception of the mandatory pro bono work. The \\"twist\\" is that one of the associates passed the bar without attending any law school, much less Harvard Law. The scripts are run of the mill, but Gabriel Macht, and the actress who plays the head of the firm have enough magnetism to rise above the scripts.  Second lead, the young associate sans formal legal training is pleasant but IMHO lacks chops. The \\"villin\\" of the show, the attorney responsible for the care and feeding of new associates is \\"Dishonest John\\" without the mustache. The character is written way over the top, but the actor playing him is very watchable and skilled, he manages to make a ridiculous part seem credible, and his mobile features contribute immensely to making the show watchable.
B0074YVW1G|5.0|This book has really changed my opinion of myself. No longer do I get frustrated with myself for needing some recharge time, needing peace and quiet to focus, or feel guilty about just wanting to stay in on Friday night and read a good book. It was so comforting to realise that I don't need to conform to the extrovert ideal and that my calm, non confrontational, rational approach to problems is just as valuable. I've already bought several copies for my introvert friends.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was a hit but so many parts of the book that were pivotal just were not there and a disappointment. The selection of actors was dead on. Can't wait for the follow up movies and more writing from Suzanne Collins.
0525423656|5.0|You know what? I must be a weirdo because I thought this beat the trash out of \\"Matched,\\" the first book in the trilogy. Ms. Condie's writing improved in leaps and bounds this go around and I think the reason behind that has to do with the fact that she really knows her characters and they finally have some legitimate substance! A lot of reviews have commented that they felt like there was no plot and that this book was a resting place for Condie to \\"catch her breath.\\" I couldn't disagree more! Sure, the characters themselves didn't grow in leaps and bounds due to excessive self reflection like in the previous novel, but plenty was happening.  We learn more about the Rising and realize that maybe the grass is only slightly greener. We also gain insight on some of the other provinces and their struggles. This novel went above the tedious teenage whining of the previous novel and set the stage for the final installment, which is what the purpose of a second book should be! I wasn't going to pick up this novel because I disliked \\"Matched.\\" However, I loved this book and now I'm actually excited for \\"Reached.\\"
B008XG1X18|4.0|love pinterest and this app is easy to use....I pin a lot of things then go to my desktop later to review and better see some of my pins! get this app!!!!

B0092MKFIY|5.0|I was so excited for this album to come out after the Continued Silence EP, and it was worth the wait. Like the EP, each song has a familiarity to it but at the same time manages to be new and fresh. These guys really know how to craft a song. There's a cohesion here but each song throws new elements into the mix. My only \\"complaint\\" is that 4 of the songs are duplicates from the EP. Would love to hear more new stuff! Hoping this band keeps up the great work.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This is a good app. It does what it says. Download it and use it.  It is clear and easy to use.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I was wondering if it really was going to be a book that I enjoyed and learned a lot from. I ordered it for my Kindle and started reading it and it brought so many new views on love and how we \\"speak\\" love. Even though I am not married and this book speaks a lot about marriage, it is still very helpful to anyone in any serious relationship. This will be a book that I will recommend to anyone who is looking for a way to improve their relationship. This is a book that I will be coming back to a lot to remind me exactly what it is that I need to do to keep the love alive in my relationship.
B005FITIDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Gerard was excellent as usual. Knowing this is a true story made me love it more. Entertaining, educational, and inspiring; I never knew about all this. Sad, but a wonderful story. What wonderful work this man has done and continues to do.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Intertwined story lines and superb acting leave me craving more.  A story that is not in a hurry to get to the end, but takes time to develop the journey for so many lives -- wish more productions would follow this course.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Many of the ideas were far fetched but I like reading things of that nature. Really enjoyed it and I have recommended to others.
B0079J28NW|5.0|Got this classic Beatles film on bluray. They did a fantastic job converting it to HD! If you've never seen it or if you are a fan of surreal animation, it's definitely worth a look.
B005SI524S|5.0|Very funny, but aren't all of the episodes? Love the rivalry between Sheldon and Will wheaton. Lots of laughs. Must see
B004ATUEJY|5.0|Love the music to begin with so this is a no-brainer.  Love it, love it, love it.  And down loading was easy.  A little pricey but worth it to me.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Really funny movie with some outrageous moments. Two opposite characters and actors worked quite well together. It is nothing serious. It is just a silly movie that leaves you with a lot of laughsWe have lots of terminology for what happens when two male stars appear to have the platonic hots for each other. The genre is called bromance. The feelings are bromantic. The orientation is bromosexuality. What Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have in 21 Jump Street scrambles, transcends, and explodes all of that.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I found Christian a compelling character since book one...and by the end of freed I was cheering him on and hoping for happy ever after!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|lots of fun! can't put it down. GREAT app! I have already told lots of people to get it &amp; try it out.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Had me giggling, tearing up and feeling love in one awesome movie. I loved it as much as I loved the other 3. Definitely worth watching.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved the movie.  I do have to say the book was better because it has so much more detail and you know what the character is actually thinking whereas the movie skips a lot of scenes from the book.  But I really liked the actors they chose for each character.  Its a great movie and the books were great.  Excited for the next movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a cool game awesome addicting and I love it I can play I all day long<br />Amanda davis
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A FREIND.  ONCE I STARTED IT, I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.  TOTALLY ENGROSSING.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm obsessed with the Hunger Games Trilogy and I think Gary Ross did a really great job with the movie. He put all the important things in it and they way he filmed it was brilliant. I think you'll like this movie if you know the books or not. It is simply a good movie.
B000FC1MM8|3.0|This is a good read and does keep one's attention, but not the best in the series. I thought the plot surrounding the murder mystery was a bit thin. More attention was given to Detective Bosch's personal life.
0525423656|5.0|I couldn't put Matched or Crossed down. I literally read them both in 2 days. I would definitely suggest getting this book if you are a fan of love triangle adventure books.
B004O2HAMG|5.0|I watched Lonesome Dove with my grandfather growing up and always hated when it was over so i was so excited when they made a series.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love it. the music is beautiful and the art put into it amazing. the puzzles themselves make you think and are relaxing. magnificent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun and easy if you got a quick hand and mind. however with the amount of points awarded it could take some effort to unlock the next level.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This is the third in the series, and it's just as intriguing as the first two. The writing and prose are really off, but the story is still interesting.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book absolutely drew me in from the first few pages!  I couldn't put it down.  I started neglecting my family to read just one more chapter. With its interesting plot twists and engaging \\"he said\\"/\\"she said\\" point of views I couldn't stop reading until I knew how it ended.  Truly great reading!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reading this book definitely made one think.  It was especially good due to the fact that the writer was able to write in both the husband's voice and the wife's  voice.  It kept the reader guessing right up to the end!  Good Read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is an entertaining and fast read.  Love the availability of the book on Amazon and you cannot beat the cost!Suzanne Collins keeps your attention, making it hard to put my Kindle down
0385343175|5.0|Purchased as gift for my wife.  She liked it. Will get her another Danielle Steele book if she wants one.
B002ZCLH5S|5.0|One of my favorite movies great to see it again, and most likely i will watch it over and over
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is well-edited in terms of grammar. It is derivative, contrived, hokey and trite. The erotic scenes were boring. Too much Ayn Rand mixed with Emily Bronte.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thrown right back into the world of Panem, the story starts to take shape and you won't believe what's on the next page!
B008JOK59K|5.0|This is the third straight great album by The Gasligh Anthem.  It is really great to see bands that can make a couple of great albums instead of the one album wonder.
B008XFB86Y|5.0|If you enjoy gore and kung-fu style movies intertwined into the times of now you will enjoy this movie. Very graphic and enjoyable
B0083VFEMW|4.0|This is another good album from the Scissor Sisters.  There are the normal, quirky songs they normally have on their albums and songs that you want to listen to over and over.  If you are a fan if their work, this album is for you!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very interesting, I was somewhat surprised about ending.  Quick read and the author was superb in her story telling skill, keeping you interested from the first page.
B0080BFWAE|5.0|I love this movie! One of my all time favorites of the 80's. Can't stop watching. Good price and recieved the blu-ray in my mailbox in new condition. Thanks Amazon!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is great. Not as good as the book, but it is really close. If you know the Hunger Games series you will love this movie. I did.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Saw this in People Magazine, sounded good. Only issue I had with this book is some of the language/and \\"sex talk\\"..but read those fast and move on--the story is worth it! I thought I \\"knew\\" what was happening in the 1st few chapter's, but figured can it be that easy? ....NO, and NO again. Just when you think you \\"get it\\" wow another twist and turn. Funny how you love Amy in some chapters,then you love Nick,vice versa.........Then Whammy!....never knew what was coming! Wish there was a sequel but I'd be to scared to read it...Gone Girl, great title, great book!
B0032JTV6U|4.0|\\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" has been the motto for the cast members of Glee and their characters for three seasons now. Glee is an extremely peppy and upbeat musical comedy following the students of McKinley High School who are members of the show choir, New Directions. With an interesting mix of jocks, cripples, goths, populars, and one large version of Tinkerbell, the students never make it easy for their protective director, Will Schuester, who is reliving his old glory days vicariously through his students. Along with an unconcerned principal, a germaphobic guidance counselor, and an androgynous cheerleading coach determined to run the glee club into the ground, life is never boring for these kids in small town Ohio.<br />Glee first aired in May of 2009 on Fox Network and is preparing to air their fourth season in September 2012. Glee was created in 2005 by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan and was originally written to be a movie based off of Ian Brennan's own high school show choir experiences.<br />Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have also worked on American Horror Story and Nip/Tuck together. Ryan has also written for Popular on the Warner Brothers Television Network. In my opinion, I find it pretty hilarious that two of the three writers and creators of Glee also helped write American Horror Story and Nip/Tuck. These three shows just do not seem like they fit in same category.<br />I must warn you, this show is highly addictive. I, myself, have bashed, ragged on, and said every mean thing I could possibly think of to say about this overly perky, sorry excuse for a musical show. All of this was before I watched it. I was recently conned into watching the pilot of this show and was hooked. Glee is over-the-top, obnoxious, hyper, and wrongfully portrays high school in almost every aspect, but you can't deny the humor and amazing vocal talent showcased in every episode.<br />Glee has reinvented oldies hits as well as top forties today. No matter what genre or dance number they pair with each song, I always find myself singing along and tapping my foot. Besides all the musicality, my favorite thing about this show is all the hair jokes. Will Schuester, choir director, has beautifully coiffed, curly hair that Sue Sylvester, Will's arch nemisis, constantly cracks witty briar patch and product jokes that always have me crying or rolling on the floor hugging my sides.<br />As I mentioned above, Glee is a horrible excuse for a high school comedy. I personally find it ridiculous that almost every cast member that is portraying a sixteen-year-old high school sophomore is actually twenty-five years or older. No wonder we all have such a warped perception of ourselves.<br />I would highly recommend this show for anyone who loves music. I am aware that that is a very broad generalization, but it's true. This show performs everything from GaGa to Kiss.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|A great addition to any Doctor Who Collection. My son and I are big fans of the series and now he can make his own Doctor Who adventures.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The Walking Dead is a television show on AMC about a group of strangers banding together for survival after the world experiences the Zombie Apocalypse. In this horrific drama we follow the stories of Rick Grimes, a sheriff's deputy who always trusts his gut even when it's wrong, his errant wife, Lori, and their over-eager son, Carl. We also follow Rick's backstabbing best friend, Shane, a wiz-kid, Glenn, a whining desperate woman named Andrea, Daryl, the good ole country boy, T-Dog, the strong, silent man of the group, Carol and her daughter, Sofia, and Dale, the constant lookout.<br /> This television series is based on the comic book also named, The Walking Dead. This monthly black-and-white comic from Image Comics was first issued in 2003 by writer Robert Kirkman, who has also written Invincible for Image Comics as well as Ultimate X-Men and Marvel Zombies for Marvel Comics, and artist Tony Moore, who has illustrated Fear Agent and The Exterminators for Image Comics. The Walking Dead was awarded Best Continuing Series at The Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards in 2010, the same year AMC adapted the series to the hit TV drama it is today.<br /> The story mainly takes place in Atlanta, Georgia, and the countryside surrounding the city as the group of survivors fight against the hordes of zombies also known as the \\"walkers.\\" Although, the show is about the Zombie Apocalypse, the bulk of the story is based around the relationships and interactions of the people left alive still struggling day to day.<br /> In my opinion, that is the best part of the show. This is not your stereotypical zombie/survivor story. Yes, the \\"walkers\\" are around every turn. Yes, I personally get way too involved in the story and become that person that everyone hates who yells at the screen, but only because the show does focus more on the characters and you become attached.<br /> Although this show is above most of the other zombie stories, it could be improved. I hate that so many people die. Like I said earlier, you get very attached. Yes, I understand that this is probably how it would be if this were to ever actually happen to the world, people dying every other minute would be something you would have to get used to. I still don't like it.<br /> I would recommend this show to anyone who loves drama, can handle quite a bit of gore, and wants to better his or her chances of surviving an apocalypse. This show is not meant for someone who gets easily queasy or nauseous. I personally love all the gore and drama.<br /> Someone who loves this show might also like the films Zombieland or Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. There have been a ton of movies based off of the comic book genre lately, everything from new Batman movies to Brain eating zombies. The comic book/film industry crossover is only becoming more popular and in my opinion on the up and up.
0634089358|4.0|This book is easy to read and follow. I like the fact that there is no tablature, this makes you read the music which is just fine with me. It's great to learn how to play bass on your own with the help of a good book.  Thanks
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This is a good app and it seems pretty accurate most of the time.The time just won't set right. If aneroid would fix that this would be a great app and very convenient.
B008133MDK|5.0|All I can say is that I wish there were more than three episodes per season!  This is such a great show!  The way they have designed it for the modern world works beautifully!
B0083GQKQG|4.0|A dark, creeping story that left me screaming on the inside while mutely watching Tilda Swinton (the world's best actress,) play the world's most unfortunate mother.<br /><br />Kevin is \\"The Bad Seed\\" redux.<br />Outstanding acting by entire cast; beautiful photography; surreal telling of a macabre tale.<br />This one stayed with me for some time after.
B008KW43TE|5.0|This is a wonderful CD. This definitely calms the soul. From the moment I played the track there was tremendous energy associated with Frank Oceans words. Many things that I would relate to.
B0073XV2W2|4.0|definitely enjoyed it, left with lot's to think about re: surveillance technology.<br />didn't get the same feeling of excitement i got from daemon/freedom though.
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|There was so much hype over this movie, that I went out and bought the books so that I would know what the fuss was all about. I loved the books.  Have actually read them a few times now, so when the movie was release I rented it right away, excited to see the book brought to life.  I don't know that I've ever been more disappointed in a movie.  It just didn't do it justice and in some instances blatantly changed important facts from the book.  Facts that run through all 3 books.  Just did not like this movie.  At all.
B003JYOEYM|4.0|This was a good installment of the DOD series.  I never get tired of zombies.  It also has an ironic end of the movie twist not unlike the original dawn of the dead movie.  See it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read the trilogy...each books gets better and better.  Sexy love story, I really enjoyed it!!  Wish there was a book four to read!!
B001NLKZUA|4.0|As the second book of the amazing Mortal Instruments City of Ashes is wonderful. Expect the unexpected with this book and the following to come. You'll meet new characters and fall in love with them. And if possible you'll love and hate the characters from City of bones. Especially the infamous Jace Wayland or morgenstern. But read this book you won't regret it.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Some of the games are simple and some are difficult but I honestly would rather have less games. I would rather have them be more consistant.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Very well organized and easy to use. Especially like the section \\"Other World News.\\" Too often U.S. news agencies and outlets focus on the trivia of Hollywood or celebrity but I want to know what is going on around the world. BBC excells as a news organization.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This was a great read -- filled with suspense, interesting characters and a historical setting!  It was tough to put down.  One of Ken Follet's early books, it is one of his very best!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, to try something no one was TELLING me to read.  Something no one (in the general media public) knows about yet.  Boy, am I glad I was drawn to this.  A great life story to go along with an addictive love story.  I'd definitely recommend to read this, and then the second book, too.  I read both books in three days!!!  I'll leave my review for what to do after the second book in my review for Point of Retreat.
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|Steven Soderbergh has directed many successful movies ranging from Sex, Lies and Videotapes to Syriana, Michael Clayton and Oceans Eleven. The latter three all starring George Clooney.<br /><br />So, when he saw MMA fighter Gina Carrano fight he had the idea to build a movie around her character, and Haywire is the result. His fascination with her is understandable, and he takes an appreciable risk casting an unknown and inexperienced actress in a leading role.<br /><br />The risk I think does pay off. While she may lack the smooth acting technique of a more established actress, she more than compensates for this with her charisma and presence, her impeccable fighter skills, and fascinating physicality.<br /><br />When an operation goes wrong members of a shady organisation, intent on cleaning up pursue her with the intent to kill. It's nothing personal just business.<br /><br />I loved for example that she traveled to Ireland on a mission, and part of the pursuit takes place through Dublin City. The odds against her seem insurmountable, and she has to push to get even before she gets squared away.<br /><br />Because of her fighting skills the fight scenes have a gripping realism, and usually she is fighting men who are also very skilled, and whether she will win is by no means certain. In one fight she is attacked by surprise from behind.<br /><br />I have to admit I did enjoy this movie a lot more than I expected. It's a refreshing change from the formula where the fight scenes are obviously choreographed, and you get MTV style cross cutting and slow motion where the heroines hair doesn't get mussed.<br /><br />You can watch many clips of Gina Carrano on youtube, and decide for yourself if you are intrigued and I totally enjoyed the movie. I do hope it's not the only movie she makes. Haywire boasts an impressive cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, Michael Fassbender, and Channing Tatum.<br /><br />I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpfull
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very soothing way to burn up some time when you need something that's not going to have you spazing all over the room trying to play.
B008602KQI|5.0|I felt that this film brought the book to life in a way that was very faithful to the book's story detail, while omitting some of the most unnecessary gore and grimness, that didn't to be there to get the ideas across.  When I first saw the film I was a little disappointed in the choice of actor to play Peeta.  Josh Hutcherson is cute but isn't he wasn't my vision of what Peeta was like.  In my head, Peeta was a much larger (and much hotter) guy.  However, the longer he was on screen and the more times I watched JH act the role, the more I could never envisage another actor playing that role-- so thoroughly and completely does Josh embody Peeta's decency and humanity.  At the end of the third book, Katniss somes to realize as she puts it, that she doesn't need Gale's fire. What she needs is the dandelion in the spring that gives hope to the heart, the hope of love and better things, the hope that nourishes both body and soul.  She can't live without it and neither can we.  The choice of Jennifer Lawrence to play Katniss is utterly perfect and apparently so from the first frames of the film.  And Lenny Kravitz as Cinna...that was a stroke of genius! But every cast member is perfect for their roles and it was a pleasure watching all these extraordinarily talented actors work.  I appreciated the art direction as well and I liked that the costumers felt free enough not to be compelled to be so literal in their interpretation. The extras on the DVD were interesting also but was a little disappointed in their quality. They didn't add very much.  Possibly I was spoiled by the truly excellent extras in another of Gary Ross' films, Seabiscuit. But i would recommend this DVD and everyone I know who liked this film and enjoyed the books is eagerly looking to the next installment, Catchfire.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I use avast! on my other computers and devices. it is a very competent product. I'm glad to pay for their work so the free app was a bonus.
B003TH2LA8|5.0|I just found this series last week and had never heard of it. I was not that impressed at first, but I found myself thoroughly enjoying this show by the end of the first episode. The characters are intricate and likeable or unlikeable depending on if you are a fan of good or bad. :)  I totally enjoyed the young actor who plays Richard. He had such charm about him. And for the guys out there, this show has probably the best looking women I have ever seen in a TV series.  I think it deserved at least a 3rd season if not a fourth.  It's a fantasy. Those who compare it to the books should just not watch it if you are letting that be your guide. To those who find the day-to-day life stressful and want something that will make you cheer, smile, cry, and just about every other emotion, take a chance and watch it.  Give it time. It will grow on you.
B00828JCI8|5.0|As always, great writing and awesome comedic acting. This show keeps getting better each season. Howard in space and married, what an episode.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|A Long Way Gone was a good book although I do not recommend it for those people who have problems with graphic images. The book is real in a sense that he leaves no details out and for people who have never been affected by war or have never seen a war at it's worst then this book can be sad or depressing and life changing. So be warned be fore reading it! Do not read if you have a low tolerance for gore! Other wise I highly recommend it because it shows you the real problems that we need to worry about rather then what we are wearing the next day!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm very surprised that this book is rated as high as it is. This comes off to me as some early 70's smut. The Kindle says I'm at 28% and that's where my progress will likely end. This is somebody's (detailed) fantasy about having sex with, and being in a relationship with a very wealthy individual. A handsome Bill Gates?<br />No, I'm not a prude, I just don't need to read about my sexual exploits, nor share them with the NY times best seller clientele, especially in fantasy land.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was a revelation. So many things I have felt guilty about (not talking to my grade school classmates when my mother pushed me to at Mass on Sunday mornings)or hurt by (why did no one remember that the focus for the conference was my idea?)or embarrassed by (like not being able to make phone calls when other people are in the room) now make sense. There's nothing wrong with me. I'm just an introvert, and pretty high on the introversion scale.<br />Cain uses research and studies, including the latest in brain science, to make distinctions between shyness, introversion and high sensitivity and to show how introverts are actually wired differently than extroverts.<br />Introverts can overcome their introversion when passionate about a subject--that's why I'm a good teacher. But it's also why I need quiet time before the class starts (I've always envied those teachers who chat with their students ahead of time).<br />And introverts can be great leaders as well, in fact, they are usually better leaders their extroverts when working with pro-active employees (extroverts do better with passive employees).<br />If you're an introvert, this book will change your life. And I think it also should be required reading for anyone who works with others. Cain describes the problems caused by open-space offices (more worker dissatisfaction) and overturns the notion that brainstorming and team work produce better results. In fact, people working alone are more likely to come up with better ideas than people working together.<br />Hooray for solitude and Quiet!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My granddaughter told me about this book.  She said she bought it and started reading it and could not put it down.  I ordered my book and I really hate to put it down but I have other things I have to do.  I am almost finished with it and can hardly wait for another book to read.<br /><br />I like to hear what others have to say about a book and if I still am not sure I get the sample on my kindle, however most of the time I go by what a friend recommends.<br /><br />I have the Kindle First Generation and I just love it.  I bought it because I always had to give the books away after reading them and with my kindle I can now keep them and read over and over as much as I want. I donot regreat the money I had to pay for the kindle it was a great investment.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|CARRYING A HEAVY ESV STUDY BIBLE IS NOW A THING OF THE PAST. THE KINDLE VERSION IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS MY PRESENT ESV BIBLE. I FIND IT EASY TO READ AND STUDY WITH NO MORE HEAVY LIFTING. I THINK THAT THE CROSSWAY ESV STUDY BIBLE IS THE BEST THERE IS.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought that this book was suspenseful. I couldn't guess the answer, I had to read all the way to the end to find out if Jacob was guilty or not.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Being able to get most all of the sci-fi movie and show references makes this show even better.  Sheldon is hilarious!  Could do without Howard's perviness and sometimes Raj is annoying.  But as a whole one of my favorite series ever!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was perhaps the very best Navy Seal book that I have ever read. I had no idea when I purchased it that it would tell the story of not only an American hero but of the God who sustains us all. My heart breaks for the families of the brave warriors who fight for us and this book surly illustrates this \\"human\\" factor. It was almost as if I actually knew the folks in this book.
B0018AT7DW|5.0|I got lucky that Amazon had a sale on GD download albums, $2.99. All killer songs, no filler crap on here. I used to have this on cassette back in the mid nineties, when I really started getting into GD. I like the album now better than i did when I first had it in the nineties! The live bonus cuts on here are great as well.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read somewhere that this author can be compared to Tolkien. While I do not compare the master of Hobbits and scholar of all-things-MiddleEarth, Martin weaves a story about a world so strange, so special, yet so magically human that I could not put it down once I started it, and can see the series rapidly developing onto the shelves of my library. From the first word on, the author weaves a web that will catch you if you're not careful. A wonderful read, and close, but not quite there, to the forests of Lothlorien. Here you keep a GodsWood. There Elven magic kept the woods safe, not surrounding castle walls. But the story-telling is equally magical...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed an app to help me balance check book and figure gratuities when I dine out with friends. This app works perfectly!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Excellent piece of work!! We are now 2 in our family reading Steve Jobs..One in kindle and one in Ipad. We both agree we are delighted reading this biography..
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved Hunger Games.  I quickly read the trilogy while on vacation. I am now reading anything that Suzanne Collins wrote.
B00846REIS|1.0|This novel left me wanting more...more of a good novel.  This was a knockoff of the Shades series; not an original concept. Very disappointing.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a big fan of KIng's in high school - I read pretty much everything he'd published to then, often more than once. Somewhere along the way I stopped reading him, but I'd heard enough good things about this book to check it out. Glad I did. I read the book in a few days despite its length, and then started it over again to soak in the details. This book succeeds on many levels: as science fiction, as historical fiction, as just great writing. Highly recommend.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|My best friend told me that I could not form an opinion on something that I had not read, so I read it and my opinion remains the same. Immature writing style, not enough storyline and way, way too much sex. I am, however, quite fond of the character and will probably read on, skipping over the sex scenes, just to find out how they evolve.
B005723JSQ|4.0|If you, like I do, read Kinsella's work purely for its entertainment value, then this is the book for you. She consistently makes me laugh, and her use of footnotes to do it this time around was inspired.
B004RKXHZY|4.0|This was one of those books that made me smile and I wanted to read every night. The characters were very different. They were people I really wished I knew. I think many books, especially teen reads lack a dynamic main character. The love interest(s) is/are usually the exciting part. (Think Twilight) But Lola was eccentric and girly and bold and I loved her. But I was also completely wrapped up in Cricket. He was absolutely perfect with actually being flawless. I feel like Stephanie Perkins knew my dream guy and wrote a story about him. Only I'm not as cool as Lola. She deserves him.<br /><br />As a side note, I actually read the books out of order (which is fine if you do too) but Anna and St. Clair from Anna and the French Kiss appear a lot so fans of that book will be excited to see them again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is sometimes a difficult book to read - Katniss is really put through the wringer - but Collins wraps up the series in a compelling and mostly satisfying way.
1439102430|5.0|Temperance Brennan is called out on an unusual (even for her) assignment by the coroner of the Quebec police department. As the official forensic anthropologist to the Province of Quebec, Dr. Brennan is tasked with determining the identity and cause of death of bodies that are otherwise unidentifiable. In her career in both the French-speaking province of Quebec and her American base in North Carolina, she has had to wade through swamps, dig through chemical-filled toxic waste barrels, unearth bodies from landfills and roadside graves, and sift through plane wrecks. If you've followed Tempe's colorful career, you've become inured to the gruesome details of her profession. Whether the bodies are mummified, burned beyond recognition, or unearthed after so long a time they are beyond the standard means of available to local authorities, Tempe is able to piece together the elusive clues that the dead have to reveal of who they were, how they died, and often discovering the killer's identity.<br /><br />In BONES ARE FOREVER, Tempe is summoned to a tenement apartment recently occupied by Amy Roberts, who had shown up at a hospital emergency room bleeding heavily following the apparent birth of a baby. She slipped out of the emergency room, which led to summoning the police, who suspected foul play. They searched her empty apartment looking for her or a newborn, but the only evidence they found were bloody towels in a dumpster behind the building. No woman. And no baby.<br /><br />Tempe finds not one but three tiny corpses tenderly wrapped in towels hidden behind walls in the apartment. An investigation leads to evidence that Amy, who has several aliases, is a Native American prostitute who may have fled to Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories. This leads to involvement by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as Tempe and her former flame, Quebec homicide detective Andrew Ryan, head into the Canadian wilds. Ryan's RCMP counterpart, Sergeant Ollie Ryan, turns out to have had a brief acquaintance with Tempe, much to the embarrassment of all three, which leads to a very testy trio who must travel together deep into the Canadian interior to track down the elusive mother and possible murderer of her newborn babies.<br /><br />They uncover a much more sinister situation in Yellowknife, a rough outpost at the beginning of the infamous Ice Road. Amy's disappearance and the infant deaths are linked through a criminal connection in the growing diamond trade in the frozen wastelands. When Tempe identifies the genes of the deceased infants, she discovers that their iindigenous genes put their mother and her sisters in jeopardy.<br /><br />Tempe's trademark attention to detail delivers fascinating insight into a little known or understood connection between diamond mining and the cruel price paid by the men and women who work for the mining companies. The local residents who originally worked the played-out gold mines are dependent on the developing diamond mining industry. The destruction of the natural wildlife habitat surrounding the vast surface pits being bored into the earth in search of the world's most coveted gems is attracting another element to the region: organized crime.<br /><br />If you are a follower of the obsessive-compulsive television version of Tempe Brennan and her marriage to her FBI husband, and the book version of the single, independent woman whose love affairs often complicate her life, you will recognize the complexity of keeping the two heroines straight. These two women with the same name and profession couldn't be more different, yet Kathy Reichs remains thoroughly involved in both the screenwriting and her bestselling novels. In real life, Reichs is just as complex and brilliant as her characters, as she knows this rare profession as a veteran practitioner. It is her attention to detail and many years of  rich personal experience that lend authenticity to the details in each of her endeavors.<br /><br />Fans relish the explicit forensic minutiae and often, as in the case of BONES ARE FOREVER, receive the bonus of a comprehensive and fascinating background on diamonds, their creation and the complexities of extracting them from the earth. For some, it may lead to questioning the real worth of the tiny sparkling gem that stands for love and devotion, but is derived at a larger cost in human lives and environmental destruction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Roz Shea

B008KGPEQG|5.0|The winter of 2010-2011 delivered more than five feet of snow and a host of other meteorological insults to New York City. It's not surprising that the enforced confinement brought on by that onslaught put Paul Auster in a reflective mood on the eve of his 64th birthday. The result is WINTER JOURNAL, an idiosyncratic memoir that is at times cerebral, at times bawdy, and in every sense consistently rewarding, from a man who has spent his life \\"bleeding words onto a page.\\"<br /><br />Auster's selection of his narrative voice seems risky at first, but it's one that ultimately enhances the uncanny power of the book. He presents his reminiscences in the second person, and while we understand he's describing people and experiences that have shaped his life, it's impossible, especially for a reader anywhere close to Auster's age, to resist the subtle invitation to engage in similar excavations of memory. That sense of identification wells up from the book's first paragraph:<br /><br />\\"You think it will never happen to you, that it cannot happen to you, that you are the only person in the world to whom none of these things will ever happen, and then, one by one, they all begin to happen to you, in the same way they happen to everyone else.\\"<br /><br />From there, the story proceeds in an episodic, impressionistic fashion, true to its title as the record of the author's musings through one bleak winter. Auster is an inveterate listmaker of everything from his scars (\\"you understand that they are marks of life, that the assorted jagged lines etched into the skin of your face are letters from the secret alphabet that tells the story of who you are\\"), to his brushes with \\"a number of potentially absurd, nonsensical deaths,\\" to the 21 residences he's occupied from his birth in East Orange, New Jersey in 1947 to his current home in a four-story brownstone he shares with his wife, the writer Siri Hustvedt, in Park Slope, Brooklyn.<br /><br />That catalog of domesticity consumes some 54 of the book's 230 pages, but it's far from tedious, instead allowing Auster to discourse on subjects as diverse as his encounter with French anti-Semitism, the erratic course of his romantic life, and the birth of his writing career. Whether (as seems likely) he kept a meticulous record of these events, or merely possesses a prodigious memory, his stories overflow with precise, closely-observed detail, delivered in seductive prose whose tone ranges from darkly comic to frankly grim.<br /><br />Despite that near-perfect recall, Auster recognizes the constraints imposed on even the most acute narrator when recounting the story of one's life: \\"Some memories are so strange to you, so unlikely, so outside the realm of the plausible, that you find it difficult to reconcile them with the fact that you are the person who experienced the events you are remembering.\\"<br /><br />He devotes considerable attention to his annus horribilis of 2002, what he calls his \\"year of grim surprises.\\" In those 12 months his mother died suddenly, an event that brought forth no tears, but rather a panic attack where he recalls that \\"you lay on the floor and howled, howled at the top of your lungs, howled because death was inside you and you didn't want to die.\\" He suffered a blood clot in his leg and a damaged cornea, and caused a car accident that nearly killed his wife. Death in all its forms hovers over these events, a persistent, uninvited guest.<br /><br />Perhaps it's his recognition of how close he came to losing her that prompts his tender tribute to Hustvedt, his wife of 30 years. Whether it's his affinity for the quaint Christmas customs of her Minnesota-resident Norwegian family (\\"food as ritual, as continuity, as family cohesion --- a symbolic anchor to prevent you from drifting out to sea\\") or his description of her as \\"a brilliant woman, one of the best minds you had ever met,\\" Auster candidly acknowledges the good fortune that brought them together: \\"You didn't deserve it, but neither did you not deserve it. It just happened, and nothing can account for what happened to you except luck.\\"<br /><br />As this review is being written, amid the dog days of August, it requires a determined act of imagination to conjure up the feeling of the icy winds that will blow a few short months from now. Whether you experience what Auster calls the \\"journey through winter\\" literally or figuratively, this book will serve as a worthy companion when you embark on it.<br /><br />Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I almost stopped reading it when I discovered his \\"secret\\" because that's just not my thing. But, I decided to keep going and it got so much better. I finished all three books in about a week. Each book just gets better.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Eight-year-old Anne and her 13-year-old sister, Isabel, know from an early age that their father, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, is a force to be reckoned with. Denied male heirs of his own, he doesn't hesitate to use both of his daughters, the richest heiresses in England, as pawns in his high-stakes political chess games to further his own ambitions. As one of the most powerful and important men in 15th-century England, Warwick becomes widely known for his ability to maneuver his choice of leader onto the throne no matter what it takes. So skilled is he that he soon earns the nickname \\"the Kingmaker.\\"<br /><br />THE KINGMAKER'S DAUGHTER opens in 1465 with Anne, Isabel and their parents in attendance at the court of Edward IV and his queen, Elizabeth Woodville, in the Tower of London. Anne finds herself fascinated with Elizabeth, in spite of the fact that she is disliked far and wide. Considered an upstart, she is a widow and the first commoner to marry a King of England. At the time, Anne has no idea how great a role she will play in her life.<br /><br />Ever plotting to turn the tide of events in his favor, the Earl of Warwick arranges a marriage for Isabel solely with an eye to his political future. When that union doesn't turn out to be the advantage he thought it would be, he turns to Anne and marries her off to Edward, Prince of Wales. Edward is the son of Margaret of Anjou, one of the Earl's oldest enemies with whom he then decides to join forces.<br /><br />Powerless to refuse her father's orders, Anne finds herself wed to a man she barely knows and certainly doesn't love. When her father and husband are both killed only a few months into the marriage, Anne finds herself in the care of Isabel and her husband. Unfortunately, trading her father's supervision for that of her brother-in-law and sister is highly unsatisfactory to Anne.<br /><br />When Anne's childhood friend, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, approaches her, offers her his protection and declareshis love, she is only too glad to ally herself with him to free herself of the restrictions she has suffered. Luckily, this is a love match, and Anne and Richard find themselves ecstatically happy in spite of the political intrigue that swirls around them at all times.<br /><br />As time passes, however, the intrigue and scheming that take place at the royal court serve to bring a dark cloud over Anne, Isabel and their husbands. Protecting herself, her husband and her family from Elizabeth and her conspirators are the most important things to Anne, but when no one is to be trusted and spies are everywhere, it's hard to chart a course of action. Will Anne succeed in achieving her father's highest ambitions and become Queen of England, or will she be cast out into obscurity and disgrace as have so many others before her?<br /><br />THE KINGMAKER'S DAUGHTER is a fascinating account of political intrigue in England at the time of the War of the Roses. This tale of the kings of the House of York is spellbinding, riveting and oftentimes tragic. As usual, Philippa Gregory immerses us in another time and place filled with brilliant historical detail and draws us into the rich threads that make up the tapestry of human relationships as only she can.<br /><br />Reviewed by Amie Taylor
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book is a very good read. The story starts out somewhat slow with alot of backround details but then picks up and gets very addicting. I couldnt put it down!
B0087PWAJO|5.0|And without the help of an imaginary god and some intermediary institution to interpret the the mystery for you. But, this would be a beautiful book even if Harold and Maureen were religious. I like it better that they were not. On his walk of redemption, Harold rediscovers how much of the beauty of life can be revealed by just having a sense of purpose. I guess at age 40, I might not have understood this. At age 70, I do. Having someone to love and being able to give to others in some way is a miracle not available to every human being. Chasing a hidden god may offer the temptation of a better afterlife, but the real meaning of life, I think, is life itself. Harold has reordered his life to take advantage of the time he has left.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This game is easy to download and use to my Kindle Fire.  I hope to improve on my Chess matches.
B005CWRB44|5.0|I have had this light for almost a year.  First let me say it is bright, compared to a Mini Mag Light the E15 blows it away.  It is small enough that I keep it in my pocket with my keys all of the time.  The beam is diffused so the throw isn't as long as other lights like the PD20.  It's enough light to brighten a room or enough for a walk outside in the dark. as the only light in an average size room it would be bright enough to read anywhere in the room. I use it a lot for looking behind my computer.<br /><br />It is easy to use and doesn't come on accidentally.  The batteries can be expensive so buy them in bulk on Amazon.  All in all it is a great high quality light that comes in very handy. If you keep it on turbo very long it does heat up, but if I need a light for more than a couple minutes I would probably grab something else.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a good read.  Kept me on the edge of my seat.  I recommend these books to anyone.  Glad I bought them.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I absolutely loved this book - this was my first ever scandinavian crime novel.  After this I was hooked on inspector Wallender mysteries.<br />Here is what got my attention and ended up in me 'inhailing' the rest of his books:<br /><br />The writing style. Manning writes in clear uncomplicated sentences which reminds me of Leo Tolstoy. Simple yet incredibly meaningful. The simplicity of his writing style is like Scandinavian modern design - simple yet powerful.<br />Character development. Manning gives dimension to all characters in this book and his other books. I find that I am curious about everyone who has a role to play in the book, even characters we meet once. In my opinion, this is the biggest strength of Mankell's writing. Everyone we meet feels real.<br /><br />Kurt Wallander. He is so real and imperfect - a very real human being indeed. I also like the fact that Manning does not turn police work into a Hollywood hero story. From what little I know, it is not, and Manning manages to create a character who makes one appreciate what police does a lot more that perhaps we do sometimes. Not because we don't want to but because we just don't know.<br /><br />Social issues and international politics. Pioneered by Sjowall and Walhoo in the 60s (and I know that because after reading all of Mankell's books I started learning more about Scandinavian mysteries), this is an amazing way of learning about the Swedish society. In this particular book, I was intrigued by the cold war aspect of the plot because I grew up in Moscow during the 70s and 80s, and feel that Mankell's understanding of the east block is quite accurate. Manning's writing about Swedish support for the Nazi cause was also interesting and led me to do additional research on this phenomenon across Scandinavia. It was quite eye opening.<br /><br />Awareness, sometimes coupled with fear of death. This is old Kurt so the sentiment is quite strong in the novel. It is consistent with all of Manning's booksand he goes about it in such a real down to earth style that makes one think about their own life.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!!

B00755MHXG|5.0|The author wrote this really well. I really got to know the main character and I really felt for him when he was being bullied. I also liked how it was written from different perspectives for some parts.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a very smooth crisp game, with wonderful clarity. There is no lag on the response time for the Kindle fire version. It is a very simple game where you try to go as long as you can on a joyride and, try and solve various missions. Some of the missions are fun and silly while others can be very challenging. If you like 2D games, this is a fun one to have.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is an exceptionally good book. I must admit, it was The Hunger Games movie that got me interested, and then I had to read the books. It was responsible for many late nights, it was so hard to put down. It completely pulled me in to another world that when I was reading I was completely absorbed in. And the ending is something very special.  Can't wait to start at the beginning again!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|if you like nature documentaries, you'll love Life. the picture quality is incredible. i own Planet Earth also; compared to Life, Planet Earth looks like it was shot in the 80s. i'm not even kidding--the difference is huge. every episode is awesome, except for one weak one about plants. the behaviors captured are amazing: a toad that basically becomes a ball and falls off cliffs to avoid its predators; cheetahs taking down an ostrich; kodiak bears fishing in the ocean; and many, many more. if you're thinking of buying this series, i'd advise you to stop thinking and buy it. it's awesome.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I originally got this for my 2 year old to help him learn colors but he hasn't got to play yet because I'm addicted to it! it's starting to get harder now but it's a nice challenge.

B00846REIS|5.0|I cannot wait for the continuing love story between the two characters. I really enjoyed reading this book. It takes you to a place that some of us have never been.

B004LROUNG|1.0|Having read all of Grisham's previous books, I kept hoping it would get better with each chapter, but no luck.  None of the subjects were the least bit likable - other than one - and no matter what happened to them I could not care less.  The one character of the younger lawyer was more sympathetic, but again, I was not held spellbound.....or held at all!!!!  Having just finished reading the E. L. Jones trilogy, what can I say......., that's an author who held me AND ALL MY FEMALE FRIENDS spellbound from the first book to the third book and wishing for more.  That's what a good author does.  Maybe Mr. Grisham is getting too old or maybe he is so commercialized that he's forgotten how to write a book with some substance, some mystery or some empathy.
B0086DBE62|4.0|it was great! my fave character was the queen, also i love that actor. it was good because they built the movie around the basic snow white love story, but it had more character and more action. i also loved the 7 dwarfs!

B004VMUS9G|4.0|It says it will wake you up gradually. It does. I'm not a great fan of the interface. Too many touches to set all the details for the alarms.

B003QSMCKO|4.0|I had not seen Mulan in a very long time and it was fun to watch it with my kid. It is a great story about honor, honoring your parents and your country, and love; and how love and honor are intermingled. My only problem was with the digital technology. My roku was having some issues with the wireless network and I have three children looking at me asking why the movie wasn't coming on and if I could please fix it. Don't know, might be worth to get the hard copy.
0131103709|5.0|The book arrived right on time, and exactly in the quality it was advertised. Clearly used, but still in very good condition. The book moves through concepts very quickly, and is going to frustrate many beginners. For those who have programmed before and wish to learn C, the book is perfect for you. The book is extremely informative, and doesn't beat around the bush at all. The author gets straight to the point, and moves on. I am very satisfied with the buy.
B004QX07G4|2.0|When reading this book, I felt like I could hear Ellen talking as if she is talking during her tv show. The chapters are very short, about 3 pages or so. My main complaint is that there isn't really any substance to the book. It just seems like she is chatting/rambling about random topics.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|The book surprised me as I was not expecting it to be fun. No wonder it became a best-seller. This is a quick glimpse at some of Feynman's psychological sub-atomic \\"particles\\". He is brilliant, vane, profound, trivial, conceited, magnanimous, practical and idealistic. I made so much resonance with Feynman that I searched for some of his videos and then went on to read a bio on Gell-Mann to contrast the characters. Who says a genius or a Nobel laureate has to be pedantic, neurotic and isolated, this guy is fun!  And  yet, his views  are most profound. Truly a character where reduction is out of the question.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Outstanding.  Well written.  I could not stop reading.  It was amazing how the story enfolded.  Having this powerful person, so controlling meet and fall completely in love with a woman totally opposite of what he was used to having.  Giving her the ability to stand up to him and take control was breathtaking.  It was a true love story well worth reading more than once.I loved it.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I love the simplicity this book provides. I purchased it, as well as \\"The Shredded Chef\\", a few weeks ago and have been really satisfied with both. BLS doesn't feel like a \\"get ripped quick\\" infomercial-type product. Rather, it's a guide to how to set up a workout/diet routine that optimizes your time & effort. Another thing that really impressed me was the author's availability. I emailed him the other day to ask a question and got a response back right away!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Story base similar to several we've read about in the news. It was kinda like 20/20 repetitive. Some good input as to traing by Mom but a bit bizarre and unbelievable the escape
B0081KZ20E|5.0|I have the original first edition hard copy with cover. I first read it 20 years ago. This book is a must for those who enjoy a fast paced action packed fiction story. Its a platform for all of Mr. Forsyth's subsequent books. Highly recommended.
B00594XOZU|4.0|So this works perfectly for what I needed it for. That is, I can message between myself and a friend in another country without dealing with the international fees because this works off of my data plan.<br /><br />My biggest issue is that sometimes the messages just don't send. Both phones are in service range. Both phones are on... and yet it doesn't send from time to time.<br /><br />Overall it's a great app. Works wonderfully for quick, real-time messages. Easy to use interface. Clean graphics.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The book is boring. There is no depth and no plot. It is just sex after sex after sex. I may as well read a porn magazine.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you like roller coaster rides, this is a good book for you. Twists and turns keep you reading and just when you think you have the character figured out, you don't.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I\\"ve been listening to RUSH before Moving Pictures was released. This isn't Moving Pictures, but it is a strong recording. If you like RUSH, you will like this.
B00493E1GI|5.0|I watched this whole film and never once did it feel like Julia Roberts was acting. Julia just seemed so natural as a shallow, me-first character. Yet, I did not find her very sympathetic and as I was in theatre I regularly found myself hoping she would fall down a flight of stairs, but alas, she never does. Maybe in the sequel?<br /><br />I hope Julia realizes that as she loses her looks even more and her box office draw continues on its downward trend she might have to take a hard look in the mirror, mirror and realize she's not the pretty woman we all thought she was. (LOL, right? I just thought that one up on the spot).<br /><br />Anyway, I have a cousin name a Rimmy Jo Buckles who claims to have messed around with her husband Eric Roberts when she was in Georgia in the 80s but Rimmy is a notorious liar, so who knows. I did see this film with Rimmy and she did not like it neither. While we were watching she said: PLEASE END NOW instead of Eat, Pray, Love and I laughed at first but she kept repeating it and it got old.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun game. I would recommend to anyone. I really enjoy playing this game over and over again. buy it
B008602KQI|5.0|It's difficult to shrink a novel down into a believable two hours, but as a stand alone story, I enjoyed it, as did all my nieces.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|This show is by far one of the best sitcoms about a group of friends just trying to be successful at work and relationships, since FRIENDS! Season 7 was once again an AWESOME time and I cannot wait until Season 8 comes out!!! I love How I Met Your Mother and I think EVERYONE should be watching it!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was unique in it's content and means of story telling. I was prepared for some explicit scenes but instead received what seamed like a weird fettish by an uber hot guy with a messed up world that draws you into the story. Made me want to see what came next.
B007TMON8M|5.0|I didn't have any problem down loading this game. maybe it all has to do with your Internet signal. It's. also fun to play.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|If you have any sort of feminist values or respet for the female you might just start to loathe Christian Grey and his attitude towards Ana. It's not even the BDSM that makes their relationship utterly toxic...but his unhealthy need to control her and his emotionally abusive behavior throughout each book.<br /><br />The book gets two stars for being laughingly entertaining and a prime example of the kind of boyfriends you shouldn't involve yourself with.
B008602KQI|5.0|There has been a lot of buzz circulating around The Hunger Games, all for good reason! I once had a friend who did not wish to watch the movie because he had a hard time imagining that a movie about killing children being a spectacle wouldn't be a spectacle in itself, glamorizing the activity. I asked him to watch it and he did, after he agreed completely with me, it is an amazing movie that does an excellent job of conveying vulnerability and the goodness of people, no matter how cruel the world. Such a powerful story and with such depth, even without reading the book!<br /><br />The Bluray/DVD contains plenty of extras on how the film was made and gives fascinating insight on how different things were done for specific reasons to keep \\"the feel\\" right. Plenty of things I subconsciously noticed with the sound and the camera, now I know why they did those things.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the book, and I must say this movie followed it exceptionally well.  Very well done!  Can't wait for the next installment of the series.
B008602KQI|4.0|If you loved the book you'll like the movie. Characters were picked pretty well and it stays close to the book. Not giving it a 5 because it lacked in the intencedy I felt it could have had. Would buy part 2 if it become available<br />May the odds ever be in your favor :)
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Amazon must stop combining reviews of the same movie on different formats!  VHS, DVD, Superbit, Blu-ray: they are all different in quality and presentation.  Amazon blends reviews of these different formats together, so that no review has any value.  I'm reviewing the Blu-ray two months before its U.S. release and several days before its U.K. release.  I have not seen either release.  All indications are that this restoration is fantastic.  Check Robert Harris' thread at the HomeTheaterForum.<br /><br />Hey Amazon, how about not allowing us to review a product before its release date?
B008TRUDAS|3.0|The book was good, but think I was expecting it to be a little better since it was listed under \\"adult\\" litature. It would really be a good read for a young adult or older teen that has just gone through the loss of a parent or close family member.
0061537969|4.0|This was such a cute story - couldn't put it down too often<br />Just really enjoyed it as told by a dog.
B0052ZQMLO|4.0|With hesitation I downloaded this Kindle Dictionary, however I had absolutely no problems with setting it as the default dictionary, and it works great. Haven't played with it enough to see the extent of the vocabulary contained therein, but it terms of functionality it works exactly as stated. I have a Kindle Version 3.3, the Wifi Keyboard version.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Not as good as the book.  As frequently happens (Lord of the Rings being the exception), the movie doesn't do justice to the book.  Highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie.
0062119044|5.0|We Need to Talk about Kevin is the story of a troubling young man told by his mother in a series of letters she writes to his father following the young man's incarceration for a school shooting.<br /><br />Eva isn't an entirely sympathetic character from the beginning, but she's compelling and heartbreakingly understandable.  Unable to connect with Kevin from infancy, she struggles his entire childhood with the escalation of his disturbing behavior and her husband's dogged refusal to recognize any signs of trouble.<br /><br />Although we know from the beginning what has happened, the tension builds throughout the book as Kevin grows up and his parents' marriage struggles under the weight of their opposing views of him.<br /><br />I hated to put this book down.  The story was fascinating and definitely a page turner itself but Shriver's use of language and ability to not so much describe the emotional context of Eva's life but instill it in the reader was remarkable.  It inspired the perfect balance of compulsion and dread that kept me engaged from the start and speechless when I finished.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have read the entire \\"Hungar Games\\" Trilogy and was satisfied with the book. Although its' oreintation was  toward teenage girls, the story was engaging enough to keep the readers interest until completion of the story. I did not care for the lead character, Katniss and after viewing the movie my opinion of her did not change.  Also, the movie sucked giant donkey dicks! It was horribly boring but I digress,...  I would recommend the books to anyone for light but engaging reading.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Smooth play and lots of replay value. It's also helpful if you don't have much time, you'll be able to sneak in a few runs.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed the film, and thought the Blu-ray conversion looked great. If you enjoyed the film in the theater you'll like the BR product very much.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I found this book to be quite an easy read and an insight into life under occupation in a place that was unique in itself.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backpack as I have just started a photography class for my college credits.  I have been looking around town and could not believe how expensive they were, then I found this marvelous backpack.  It holds my camera and new lens very well.  Plenty of room for more.  It can also hold my iPad in the front pocket so I can download my photos on the go.  It has padded straps and padded back panel for comfort.  This is an awesome backpack, especially for this price!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I recommend this game for the simple concepts and intricate puzzles. It is a very entertaining and interesting logic puzzle.
B008Z9YGEE|1.0|After caving in to all the hype, I finally rented this movie. That's 2 1/2 hours of my life that I will never get back, and $4.99 that I could have used at Starbuck's. I haven't read the books, so this movie made no sense. Even if I had read the books, I still would have been disappointed. And where in the world was that one kid hiding his cake decorating kit? Really?!?!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|Even though the book was better, the movie was very entertaining.  I'm glad it was broken up into two movies, that book was huge but very action-packed.  I was sad to see it end.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|There are hours of entertainment on this game and not only does my 7yr old son love it (who we bought it for) but so does big sis, Dad and even Mom. Fun, no graphic violence, no half naked people so it's perfect for kids. It's easy to play so everyone can try, but it has so many levels and different games that you don't get bored. Good buy!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Just got this from the Amazon App Store. Very nice game, you have to think hard as the levels progress (and my head hurts). Cannot stop playing this thing....HELP!
B008602KQI|5.0|The video we purchased was excellent; we have seen it at the theater, but wanted to be able to show others who usually don't go to the movies. Came quickly, no flaws in the packaging.
B007TMON8M|5.0|Glad I caught this as the free app of the day. I was a big fan of the bridge building games, but at the time they were released, my phone was too slow to handle the real time physics.<br /><br />This game takes that concept to the next level.  Immediately like the scenarios, and the tools are really easy to use.  One of these reviews said something about asking for a credit card number?  I went into simple physics very apprehensive, but did not see anything like that.  Actually very clean interface, right into the building.  As for fake reviews,  mine is not, and I just recommend this game for anyone who likes to build stuff and then try it out.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I just saw the performance of \\"another part of me\\" from this dvd that was released for preview yesterday...so incredible!  No one could do it like Michael!  I'm not sure where the other reviewers are getting the one hour length from.  In the product description it says the length of the dvd is 135 minutes (two hours and 15 minutes).  So excited for this to be released!
B006XF5BTG|4.0|This is a great place to start your journey and even for the seasoned veterans.  Yes it is a touch repetitive but the principles are sound and clearly laid out.  Well written and packed full of useful information - I re-read it to keep me focused and love having it on the kindle version on my iPad.  Mike's website is a must as well ([...]).  Although one can't deny that he is selling books (a steal at the prices for the kindle version and that's the only products he offers by the way, no BS transformation packages that you see all over the net), he seems like the genuine deal - just trying to help out people looking to get fit.  He responds to blog posts and has responded to my emails/questions everytime.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Good book shocking written in a childlike fashion but what can you expect from someone who was not allowed to mature naturally,she is so brave!!
B008B8A9V8|4.0|I actually have a better cast on book than this but for a general all around knitter it's good.  I plan to put it in my prayer shawl ministry reference library.  It reads easily.  The pictures are clear and the spiral binding is an added plus.  You can also get it on kindle which is handy and I got that  version too.
B001B2CPH2|4.0|OK, Ghost might be more than a bit manipulative at points, but like a good Frank Capra film, you don't mind being manipulated by it--it's that good.  The storyline is pretty predictable but Whoopie Goldberg keeps it interesting when the film might otherwise lag.  But the love story is one of those that can make even the most cold hearted get misty-eyed at points.  AND, it's a pretty good ghost story.  One of the best films ever? No; but a fabulous film to watch in the comfort of your living room on a rainy evening, especially with somebody special.
B007RV5HKI|5.0|This is one of the funniest episodes of one of the funniest TV comedies ever. In it, Howard has the power to introduce Sheldon to Stephen Hawking, and thus basically owns Sheldon. 'Nuff said.
B008M34CSI|3.0|good movie nice action and decent storyline I found the premise of a jail in space orbiting above the earth interesting.
B008JIFJ4W|3.0|I have enjoyed the music and videos. Still don't much about them, but enjoy all their songs when I listen.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have been reading so much since I read the 50 Shades Trilogy and trying to find a book that fills the void.  While this one is definitely NOT a 50 Shades type book, it is an absolutely gut-wrenching beautiful love story.  Rarely does a book make me cry! I was up 1/2 the night and couldn't sleep because this book got under my skin.  I could totally relate with their relationship from my days in college.  However, the only downside to the book was that the epilogue was a little silly, but I could tell there was really no where else to go with the story.  It's a page-turner!  You can't put it down.
B008QDCZJ2|2.0|As a prelude to this review it must be known that I am and have been a steadfast and stalwart defender of Neil and Chris for most of my life. I am a lifelong fan and still consider them to be my favorite musical act. In my opinion they are without a doubt among the musical geniuses of our time, which makes their latest offering unfathomably perplexing and makes writing this review so painful.<br /><br />Having said that, Elysium is cold, soulless and dreadful. It's almost as if they folded over their usual biting cynicism and it became this recursive poison that spilled all over their usually sharp sense of taste. What we're left with is a bland insincere yawning stab at kludging together some leftover tracks.<br /><br />Much ado was made about working with producer Andrew Dawson, supposedly bringing a hip-hop edge to the proceedings. Well, that has been a disaster. Most of the tracks are flaccid pre-set sounding exercises in futility. Although some of the characteristic PSB sheen is there, the music is defined by a soft, turgid apologetic sound. I've heard demo-tracks on sound modules with more immediacy and grace.<br /><br />The first three tracks; Leaving, Invisible, and Winner are in part redeemable. They have that patented PSB sincerity, they live in that vast world full saudaude and possibilities that Neil is so expert in conjuring. But there is some ineffable element that has been excluded that fails to push them over the top. Mainly because they feel like echoes in exercises of previous efforts. To a neophyte that may not be obvious, but the comparisons are rich with allusions and as whole they fail to deliver the glorious cresting glory or the lush ennui of surrender of their antecedents.  They would be perfectly acceptable middle of the road tracks on a more filled out album like Nightlife or Yes, but as the high watermarks of this album they leave the whole effort a fetid swampy brackish mess.<br /><br />From there it goes downhill fast. 'Your Earlier Stuff' is ( I'm sure ) a comment on a frequent refrain, but simply comes across as snide and bitter. The sharp delightful commentary of 'Yesterday When I Was Mad' has devolved into a self indulgent sad sniping refrain completely lacking in grace or wit.<br /><br />Who was the engineer on 'A Face like That'? Muddy, Saturated, Narrow, Sharp. Should have checked it on the NS-10's No comment on the song itself.<br /><br />Breathing Space is a nice open ended track with some vague sentiments nothing to indict but also nothing to recommend.<br /><br />Ego music is an unholy amalgamation of Hit Music and Shameless phoned in from behind a veneer of self control. Shade-by-numbers. Someone needs to go back to work on that algorithm.<br /><br />Hold On is a hollow appeal from a dusty community theatre stage production of Jesus Christ superstar... and not in a good way.<br /><br />Give it a Go is the pumping chorus from the same production, sung as the cast does a 'train' chorus line while smiling garishly,  the lyrics lovingly crafted by the ambitious stage manager.<br /><br />Memory of the Future is almost there... clever concept, soaring movements, excellent arrangement, BUT. The plodding exhausted beat makes it fall on its face.  The production that so far has sat silently in the background trying it's best but not delivering has timidly stepped forward with it's awkward undulating grimace and foiled what could've been a standout track.<br /><br />Everything Means Something. Sing-songy plodding, dissonant and all that that implies.<br /><br />Requiem in Denim and Leopardskin. Finally a nearly perfect PSB track. Reminiscent of the mid-tempo swagger of Bilingual, this track delivers on all fronts. A heartfelt paen to a favorite aunt, replete with subtle references to people, places and themes that are entwined deep in the PSB DNA. It carries itself with the easy confidence of those who know, and gently expresses a respectfully playful view of thanatos with a firm conviction. A masterwork. Everything about this track, from the swaying calypso rhythms to the actual motorcycle redeems the boys in the end.<br /><br />I'm not sure how or why this album came about, I am disappointed in it as a whole, but do think that there are a few moments of brilliance. As someone who possesses every PSB releas this one will stay in its wrapping next to the others hoping that the next one will get ruined from being played too much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not a dull moment, worth reading, even if you already seen the movie.  If you have not seen the movie and plan on watching it, make sure you read this first, it will help you understand the movie a lot better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app works great on my kindle. I have not had a single glitch or problem since I downloaded it.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|Robin Hobb is an excellent writer. She has created an exciting world with real characters. One of my favorite series.
B008N1LL42|3.0|This movie was \\"so so\\".  It starts out very very slow with a lot of character setup that never really sets up the characters.  I mean you could have setup the cliched hot head, arrogant, military, jar head converted from loser scenario in about 30 seconds.  Why take 30 minutes? By the time they got into the actual plot which is never fully defined, or maybe it was and it was meant to be trivial and shallow, they had to rush through it so fast it was hard to keep up with all of what was going on.<br /><br />So a bit of a letdown, but the second half of the movie is entertaining.  So start the film with the sound up loud enough to hear it while your in the kitchen doing dishes or fixing dinner.  Then after your done with that, sit down and enjoy the ride.  Might be a better movie watching experience.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|The biggest complaint I have is the extremely high data/data usage. This is a big problem on some phones since that partition is tiny. This is a well known issue and boils down to laziness by the developer. Game speed can also vary a fair amount but its totally playable.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading all three books but was anxious to see how it would end.<br />Thought this book was a good ending to the series and had the usual twists and turns of the other two.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|read!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br />................................................................................. great app little expensive no smiles but worth it tons of people are asking me how do I do that<br />I search up photo editor told them the name and the apps pic and the were like sweeet so I vary<br />recommend this app..................................................................................................................oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br />read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it!  Couldn't wait to read book 2 & 3.  Loved Fifty Shades Darker and reading Fifty Shades Freed right now.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game. It's challenging, fun and interesting. It is even better than the last one. They manage to keep the same feelwhile still creating a fresh game.
B005NFW1JK|5.0|I love all the episodes. It really keeps you waiting to see whats next.  On my tip toes waiting for next season
B00122N0MU|5.0|I am not a die hard fan but I do enjoy Mark's music when I hear it. I own a few Dire Straits' albums and the album he made with Emmy Lou Harris.<br /> So this collection is perfect for me. It contains all his hits and a few more gems
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was slow getting into for me but really enjoyed it once it got going.  Will watch it many more times.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I really like how easy-to-use this Pinterest app is. I got it for my Kindle Fire and I love how I am able to pin and view my friends' pins at anytime.
B005I4JG80|5.0|As a 65 yr. old grandmother with seven grandchildren (oldest 16 and youngest 10 mo. old twins), I found this parent-friendly and child insightful book very interesting and thought-provoking.  Regarding your child (baby) as a person to be helped to discover themselves and be autonomous and yet live your own life as you should without living it through your children was refreshing to read.
B0086DB566|5.0|great film, Julia is great and Lily is awesome!! A true talent like her dad Phil Collins!! Very beautiful scenery and costumes make the film a joy to watch!!
B005S39YGU|4.0|Love love love this show. Happy to see it through my Blu-ray player on my HDTV, which I didn't have when the show began. Keeps me laughing.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Muy buena aplicación para manejar el ordenador si no estas en casa y quieres realizar alguna tarea en el ordenador como cerrar algun prograna que has dejado abierto,etc.
0525953728|5.0|Yesterday this book was delivered to my door and I read over 150 pages. This is not just an account of a Navy Seal going after Bin Laden--this is a book about a Navy Seal. I am so proud to know we have people in this country of Mark Owen's caliber. I pre-ordered this book the day I heard the government was trying to use their typical MO and \\"sue.\\" This is NOT about our thin-skinned president or classified information. This book is ALL about what we have protecting this country. I will finish this book tonight and rest better knowing there are Navy Seals out there. God bless Mark and his family.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great series... I have read it twice and plan to read it again.  This series is a page turner and I couldn't put it down especially the last book really got me hooked.  :)
B00846TRHY|5.0|I had never even heard about this film til Amazon suggested it during a browse. I was blown away! This is a must see! Great film!
B008EQIK90|5.0|One of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy dark humor then this is the movie for you.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|What can you say? John Wayne.....there aren't many movies with him in it that aren't great. They don't make many good westerns anymore so you have to stock up on the real good ones and this is certainly one of them.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|S. C. Holbrook says:<br />I completely concur with those who say this book has been a shameful debacle from idea to inception. I have the greatest respect for anyone intent on protecting those in need, anywhere in the world. What the SEALS and all of their brothers and sisters in all lines of security sign up for is way beyond my scope of ability. I am deeply grateful and let that be known whenever I connect with anyone who serves. What I DO NOT understand is this author's sudden egocentric greed, his desire for the spotlight. I feel he is disrespectful of the armed forces and the anonymity often required in their work. His pen (computer) has become a weapon of destruction used irrationally, without thought for his fellow SEALS. Despite the writing style, despite the breathtaking courage and incredibly smooth actions of Team 6, this author has put himself before his team-an action I would assume is worthy of court martial. Shame on you, and yes, shame on those who will profit from this.
0446547646|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks has come thru for us readers.  This book offers the reader a mix of emotions.  You will experience laughter and tears throughout the story.  Truly one of the best books I have read in quite some time
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool Omnibus 1-5 is an interesting, suspenseful story.  I enjoyed the characters and story line, however, the books seemed more like chapters.  I would have been very disappointed if I had bought the first book and it ended where I thought the chapter ended.  I do look forward to any new books to come out to continue the story, but I will be wary to buy unless there is more then one in the series, OR I some how know that it has more content than the first five books.(I buy through Kindle) Hope this helps!
0345803485|4.0|I picked up this book for the simple purpose of fun entertainment.  It delivered!  All the fuss about the repetition and unskilled writing is unnecessary.  Maybe it's not a literary masterpiece... but so what?  Looking past the sexual nature of the book, you find a beautiful love story.  Ok, so it's a fairy-tale story and they are just so perfect together and all that wonderful stuff, but it makes for a good escape from the real world each evening.  I am half-way through the second book and look forward to reading the third as well.  Not a waste of time in my opinion.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|A Song of Ice and Fire was very entertaining - I had a hard time putting the book down. I enjoyed the twist and turns the plot went, one minute thinking one of my favorite characters were safe, then they weren't, then they were in again.  Since I have invested so much time in the characters of the first three books, I'm still in question if I'll wait until the last books in the series are out, or get involved with the characters in the next two books.  Hope this helps.
B004J47BNM|4.0|This album has a variety of music on it.  Some songs are more rock, some are dubstep, and some are just electronic sounding (if that makes sense).  The album is pretty solid without any weak songs.
B0014EU5XI|5.0|Having no ZZ Top in my library, and having been a long-time fan, i have been waiting for a good deal on an MP3 collection of Z's best music ---and Rancho Texicano is it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Controversial or not...wow what an amazing read! A firsthand account of a \\"secret\\" operation that has seen conflicting accounts in the media and the beltway. This book sets the record straight. Brings another level of understanding and appreciation for the warriors who fight for our country. Thank you \\"Mark Owen\\" for your service and for setting the record straight.
B006LSZECO|3.0|loved the book until the abrupt ending which left me wanting more of a twist as opposed to the flat ending as written
B008IJTFYW|5.0|well I'm on vacation and I have an uncomfortable bed to sleep on. I just put this app on and it helps me feel like I'm at home in my real bed.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I'm not much of a science fiction fan, but the storyline was interesting. A lot of time was spent building up the characters, so it was slow in parts. But actually overall, this movie was pretty entertaining. It included action and romance, so could be a good date night movie.
B00338QENI|5.0|Having been raised in the south in the 60's this book is partly a reminder of how blacks were disciminated against.  But it is also a book about amazing scientific achievements made because of one woman.  Facinating....I'm sorry that this story is not more widely known and so glad I read it.  This book is on the United Methodist Women reading program.
030758836X|2.0|I can not recommend it: the story is good ... for the small book<br />I liked the humor, but I can predict from the beginning the end of the book
B00846TTDG|4.0|Overall I have to say this was a really good movie; strange really, because the acting was awful. The story, the action, everything was quite realistic, but the 2 main actors were so wooden. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with terrible acting that I've enjoyed so much. I would definitely recommend it.
B007LB2B3K|5.0|Great song, great to buy on Amazon compared to itunes as its easier to work with Amazon that it is with Itunes.
B00138CXJY|5.0|Got this when it first came out on record.  Holds up to test of time.  Brilliant poet/musician who helped define a generation.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What more can I say.  This is a very entertaining and highly addictive game.  It will keep you wanting to play more.  Challenging for sure.  Highly recommended!
B008602KQI|5.0|i hear this all the time...\\"there are no good movies these days...\\"<br />well, here is one of the very best movies i have ever seen!<br />i really cannot believe they were able to make such a good movie, especially after having read the books!<br />i RARELY say this about movies i have watched, based on books, which i have read!<br />thank you Amazon for having this available for us to purchase...and at such a reasonable price, as well!<br />laurie sydnor (a loyal amazon fan and customer)

0312641893|5.0|Since I first read Beauty by Robin McKinley, I have been enchanted by retellings.  Fairy tales have always held a special place in my heart and will always be a comfort read.  When I read about this book, my curiosity was piqued.  Unfortunately, I was not able to get my hands on it right away, so I have been pining over it.  After finishing a book for review, I decided to pick this book up.  With the loss of my husband's grandmother and another huge crisis we're dealing with, I needed something that would bring comfort.  And, of course, I return to my old love: fairy tales.<br /><br />Wow.  Just pure and simple, wow.  There are not enough words to describe the masterwork of this book.  It is simply a masterpiece and something that will stay with me for a long time.  While the characters were true to the original Cinderella story, I felt that Meyer did an amazing job making them her own and adding little twists.  For example, I never expected her fairy godmother!  Further, being a cyborg, I wondered how it would work with her stepmother, sisters, and father.  It was a brilliant idea that she was an orphan and adopted by her father.<br /><br />The characters in this book were rich!  I loved Iko!  Even though she was an android, I really liked how Meyer was able to turn her into something more.  It makes me wonder whether her personality chip was the only thing behind her uniqueness or she was growing and learning by being around Cinder.  I also felt that she made Prince Kai more approachable and human.  In the stories of Cinderella, the prince is always someone outside.  In this, Kai was a real person with real feelings.  I felt his pain when he was trying to decide how best to run his country. And Peony . . . She was a lovely, vibrant teenage girl.  It was hard not to have a fondness for her.<br /><br />The setting was as rich as the characters and the storytelling.  Meyer did a wonderful job trying to imagine what life would be like after nuclear war, devastation, and so on.  She also put a lot of thought into the technological side of things.  I liked how the palace, while fully into the here and now, still retained elements from the past.<br /><br />When I started this book, I had an idea of what the book might be, but I never really expected Cinderella and Anastasia.  That added another layer of depth to the book, and one I would have considered.  Even though it was hinted at throughout the book, I still found myself stifling a gasp when the truth finally came out!<br /><br />Cinder is nothing short of magical!  I wept for Cinder and her inability to cry, grieved with her, and found I needed to keep a box of tissues near by.  This book will always hold a place of honour on my bookshelves and will be recommended to others!nd so on.  She also put a lot of thought into the technological side of things.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|When I have put my kindle down for awhile and I want to watch a video I can check how much time is left to do almost everything.  What a great program for us daily intermittent users.  Useful and informative. I charge my kindle a couple of times a day so it is good to know when I'm close to the end of my battery .
B008602KQI|5.0|I didn't read the book but I found the movie to be thrilling with a great cinematic approach to storytelling. I didn't care too much for the 'shaky cam' in the beginning of the film. I understood what the director was going for but I thought it to be overdone. The writing was well done, laying out the story and maintaining the overlapping plots nicely. I think the film was cast very well and found the film incredibly engaging, often finding myself routing for the protagonist more so than ever. This was a great bonding experience for my wife and I as she fell in love with the books and couldn't wait to see it on the big screen. Thanks to 'Hunger Games' for making our date night awesome!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|When the doctor (talented Academy Award winner Rachel Weisz) puts Aaron Cross (equally-excellent 2-time Academy Award nominee Jeremy Renner) \\"under\\" in order to perform medical tests on him, she asks him to count backwards from 100.  Probably very few people realized that he said, \\"You are beautiful...ninety-nine...ninety-eight...ninety-seven....\\"  IN RUSSIAN.  When non-native speakers of a language have to \\"think arithmetic,\\" they almost always revert to their native language.  Hmm...  Perhaps there is more to Aaron Cross than meets the eye???
B003WGM40S|1.0|Watch this series if you want to be left depressed. Rated 5 star, now way. Loved Tess and hated everyone else except Tess's milkmaid friends.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is an awesome tower defense game. It satisfies my need for gem craft when I only have me phone.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Addicted to the first until I beat it.  Really nice game and well thought out graphics and overall theme.  Really worth a real buy on the app store
B006IMY5ZU|3.0|The movie was slow and not at all inspiring. I expected more. I just couldn't get into the behind the scenes action of owners and managers arguing.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Really cool app.  Shows 24 hour weather clock. It also gives information on earthquakes around the world, local weather alerts and advisories,
B002RSDW80|5.0|I love this movie. This was a gift for friends however not only does this movie inform us of Julia Childs start as a famous chef it also opens us to trhe importance of woemn in the work force no matter what career we pursue.Both Myrle Streep and Amy Adams are great.
B00845PV16|1.0|I love the first Ghost Rider. It was fairly true to the comic book and the story was good. When I heard about the second movie I was excited.<br /><br />  When I started watching Spirit of Vengeance I just couldn't believe they could mess up something so bad. While the story line was again good Nicholas Cage acted like a lunatic and was nothing like the Ghost Rider of the first movie or the comic book character. Also what happened to Gost Rider's biker outfit. Totally off the mark in every way. They just messed up any chance of a number three. This movie was not worth watching.
B007TMON8M|4.0|SimplePhysics is a physics based puzzle/builder game with an almost perfect difficulty curve - that WILL keep you motivated and playing for hours. Clearing each level (puzzle), revolves around your (cheaply made) creation surviving whatever test the game throws at you. The less money you spend to create whatever the level requires, the higher your star rating becomes.<br />Getting one star on all levels is very simple, and since the game has only eleven real levels... Well, it will take you about three to four hours (I'm being generous here).<br /><br />Since I downloaded the game, I already cleared all the provided levels with a one or two star rating (three stars on the first few puzzles).<br />Getting a three star rating really does require some very creative thinking, and I still can't quite figure out how to do this for most levels.<br /><br />Once you are done with the game, you can still play around in a pretty great physics based environment, with some level based surprises. I don't want to give too much away, because it really is quite fun. But you can basically mess around with your creations by blowing things up, pulling stuff apart, using slow motion, and a lot of other options. You can even zoom in and out, which is quite handy.<br />I actually spent a while just messing around on the \\"Staircase\\" level with a crash test dummy and slinky.<br /><br />This brings us to the game's excellent graphics. While most of your time will be spent in the (almost completely) blue \\"build\\" mode, or in the red and green \\"structure\\" view, when you do eventually swap to the \\"standard\\" view - the visuals will impress.<br /><br />While the game really is too short (unless you are going for a three star rating on all levels), it does have a lot of replayability by allowing you to solve each level in countless ways, and giving you a sandbox environment to toy around with.<br /><br />However, this app is not without its share of problems.<br /><br />My main issue with the gameis its pushy in game advertising.<br />Starting up SimplePhysics sometimes results in the following message: \\"I'm working on new games for physics minded people. Would you like me to send you an e-mail when I release a new game?\\"<br />Your choices are Yes and No. Selecting No clears the message for the time being, but for some reason does not disable it. I still had it pop up multiple times during my many play sessions. This needs to stop. No should mean NO.<br />There is another message, that actually appears during gameplay! It states: \\"Are you hungry for new physics & engineering puzzles? Check out my newest game, Dummy Defense! It has 57 levels of brain bending puzzles that only the smartest will conquer.\\", and just like with the previous message, declining it results in the darn thing coming back after a few games.<br />While not constant, these things are still annoying and bothersome in an otherwise good game.<br />------------ EDIT START HERE---------<br />The developer has informed me that this is a bug, and these things should only pop up once. Once that is fixed, my opinion of the game will be even higher.<br />------------ EDIT END HERE---------<br /><br />Another issue I have is the inclusion of network permissions. This is here just for the leaderboards and the ability to review this app, as well as purchase others from the developer. All of these options can be conveniently reached from the main menu.<br />While the game does also allow you to send your blueprints to a friend, this is done through a separate e-mail client and does not require the game to have full network permissions.<br /><br />Yet another concern is the fact that there are absolutely no sound or music effects in the game, at all. Nothing you do will make any noise. Eventually one gets used to the quite, but at least some sound would help out.<br /><br />My final problem with the game are all the fake five star reviews from single review posters. Developers need to learn that payingsomeone (or using a dummy account) for this purpose is not the best idea. These reviews are easy to spot and actually do more harm than good.<br /><br />To sum things up, I want to say that overall I am very pleased with this game. While short in itself, the sandbox feature adds quite a bit of replay value, and the price is fair.<br />Go ahead and download this as todays FAOTD, or buy it for the $.99 that Jundroo, LLC wants for it.
B008CP92ZO|4.0|Some really good laughs and some great dialogue amidst an overall fun, if somewhat predictable story. Do we always have to have evil developers threatening the poor hippies?

B002MQYOFW|5.0|i was so reluctant to read this book - but it was a great read.  I did not think i would like reading about teenagers fighting to the death - but it was surprisingly entertaining!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|i love this movie it is great movie about love in another country and jude law is so great in this movie one of the best
0425166805|5.0|I remember reading this book in college many years ago, when my teenager started coming in with all these school yard theories and strange facts I had to order this book and give it to him to read. I remember being taking with the Nasca Plain, the Pyramids etc. now that NatGeo has researched and explained these things I guess some of the mystery has gone out of it. Anyway if your teen comes home with all sorts of theories let them know it is nothing new and people have been trying to explain things for a long time. The Mayan calender anyone? I just wonder what explainations people will have for things like Mt Rushmore or whatever in the future. Anyway the book is still a fun read even if it is a bit dated.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|love this movie as well funny and at the end very touching about love just wonderful movie happy movie not depressing not boring i love this movie
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was so pleasantly surprised by this book. It was by far the best book (and really, 2 book series) that I have read in a long time. I was immediately drawn into Will and Lake's relationship and could not put this book down. I read Slammed in 24 hours, then Point of Retreat in another 24. Reading 2 books in 48 hours - WITH 2 kids at home, is not an easy accomplishment :) A+ !!
B005PZ857K|5.0|Best show on TV, gets better every season!  The writitng, actors, they are all awesome. It is smart writing, I love it!
B0088WGBC8|3.0|For these two actors to be in this movie it was not that great. But as far as quality of download goes it was perfect.
B003Y5HWJU|4.0|What's next after the Sopranos you ask? You have Boardwalk Empire. A series set in the early 1920s who's main character, portrayed by Steve Buscemi, is Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson.<br /><br />The Thompson character is based off a real life depiction of Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson, former sheriff turned into a powerful corrupt political boss of Atlantic City. His illegitimate affairs included control of the liquor business during Prohibition, as well as prostitution.<br /><br />Popular associates as depicted in the show included the likes of a young Alphonse Capone, young Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, and Arnold Rothstein (rumored fixer of the 1919 World Series).<br /><br />As far as the series, Terrence Winter does an awesome job with the writing of the show. Also, should be noted that Mark Wahlberg, Martin Scorcese, and Steve Buscemi are Executive Producers in some of the episodes. Portrayals by the cast such as Kelly McDonald (Margaret Schroeder), Michael Kenneth Williams (Chalky White, played Omar in \\"The Wire\\"), Michael Pitt (James \\"Jimmy\\" Darmody) was fantastic, and many more.<br /><br />This series centers on the political corruption side of the gangster world. Also, it displays the birth of the Italian, Jewish, and Irish mafia stories we love to hear about in our present-day.<br /><br />My dislikes about this film would be the physical appearances of the portrayed characters. I wasn't ammused to see Capone, Luciano, Johnny Torrio, and even Thompson look nothing like the original men. Those who are detailed picky on film biopics will dislike the facial comparisons, but the fails of the appearances are overshadowed by the well-written, smoothness of the tale. If you like gangster movies or shows, I consider this a must see!
B0088TG252|4.0|Great movie, I was engaged the entire time! Non- stop action and suspense, so exciting, I didn't know what was going to happen next, it's definitely worth watching!
B008AWBQGW|4.0|Rickwood Field, Birmingham, Alabama on July 4, 1975... it was my first concert. It was Lynyrd Skynyrd in all of their southern rock glory and the show was incredible. The Pronounced and Second Helping albums are still two of my all time favorites. This new CD is not that band but it still stands on it's own as some fine guitar driven southern rock. Of the new Skynyrd I enjoy Vicious Cycle a lot and this one as a close second. If you are new to Skynyrd give Pronounced, Second Helping, Street Survivors, and One More From the Road a listen.
B008VBYN80|5.0|I this a great game to play. I love to play it to pass the time!!!!!!!!! You should download it try it as well.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is amazing and can't wait for the sequels!  I can't believe the acting coming out of such young kids!
B004WE01YA|5.0|Got this one for my husband. I also had to buy the 3d version! It's amazing and worth the money! :) It's a total classic! Shipped a little slower but it's all good. lol :) Would recommend this to anyone!
B000U7SN8O|4.0|This anne frank themed album is as wonderful as everyone told me it would be. I finally got around to purchasing the album (after I gave up on the idea of buying it on record) at Amazon and I don't regret it. The haunting lyrics and eerie lilting tones combine into a beautiful performance reminiscent of awesome.
B008476HBM|5.0|I cna't believe that I hadn't read this before.  I really enjoyed it.  I will be reading more Jane Austin in the future.
B000FC11A6|5.0|One the best works of literary science fiction written in the last 20 years.  With a plot spanning > 60 years and flashing between well-written WWII intrigue/espionage and modern computer-geek dystopia, Stephenson delivers his best work since the classic \\"Snowcrash\\".  Who knew cryptography could be so entertaining?  Don't let the weight (900+ pages) turn you off, this is a fast paced novel that compels you forward, you won't be able to put it down.  5 stars are not enough.
0374532281|5.0|This book easily exceeded my expectations. Once I started it, I literally could not put it down. I read the entire thing in one sitting. The main character is extremely easy to like and to relate to. And the book is only made better by the supporting characters. Highly recommended.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I would recommend reading the book first before watching the movie.  The movie is great but there are still too many words and thoughts left out.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|While reading this book you have an underlying feeling and then when the book concludes you think WOW I almost figured it out<br />great read
B006LSZECO|2.0|Story line was very intriging but there was a bit of rambling in parts of the book.  If you want a sence of finality, this book is not for you.  The book did not end, it just stopped.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must confess, I have never, ever considered writing a review on Amazon. That being said, I was shocked to enjoy this series so much given that I happened to find it while browsing titles on my Kindle late one evening. I enjoyed this so much that I decided to write a review for the first time. It's not the best book I've ever read (it is most excellent however), but the originality was such that I had to write something to express my thorough satisfaction for such an entertaining book for a remarkable price.<br /><br />The Wool Series, (I've read 1-5) is a great science fiction story combining elements of intrigue, suspense, intricate plot, and enough wiggle room in said plot for the reader's imagination to run wild. I've read a plethora of science fiction, fantasy; you name it I've probably read it in those genres. I appreciate this series for it's creative approach; a thoroughly Orwellian society that was so well constructed and veiled that it takes the reader quite some time to ascertain that fact. The character development was spot on, the characters themselves quite relatable. Upon discovery of this fact, the reader is still left guessing at every turn.<br /><br />For the benefit of potential readers, I'd rather not focus on the details of the plot, rather the book itself, and I highly recommend this series. I will certainly investigate this author further.<br /><br />Intrigued indeed!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book for my college English class. Definitely a book I would have read regardless whether it was required or not. I've probably never felt like I've known a character of a book as well as Charlie.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Unable to sync my Samsung Galaxy s3 to my Kindle account, tried removing and reinstalling, still didnt work. If this app would sync with my Kindle account, I would give it 4 stars.
B005VPSEK2|5.0|This CD is really good! I don't usually listen to music that swears, so I am really glad that there is someone making good music without any profanity. I give it an A!
B005QMOZOO|5.0|Having always been a fan of Jane Austen, especially Pride and Prejudice, one imagines how the ongoing story would have played out.  PD James has done justice to this subject, everything has been covered that any fan of Pride and Prejudice would need.  Also the tongue in cheek references to her other fiction works was worked in beautifully.  I recommend this for all devotees of Pride and Prejudice.  Either way a good read.
B004QZ9P6K|5.0|Not only well written but most informative.  It was a surprise to read that a small country like Isreal could accomplish so much technically as well as in the medical field.  The book is written for even the most technically inefficient of which I am.  I especially appreciated the fact that the training received in the armed forces qualified the Isreali's to achieve so much.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was really good. The sex was important to set the tone for the other two books but it was a bit silly. Nobody in reality has \\"mind blowing\\" orgasms as often as Ana seems to.
1449314287|5.0|The 2nd edition provided clear an thorough guidance on all aspects of MySQL performance optimization and maintenance, allowing me to achieve significant gains in a very short time on a high-volume production system. The 3rd edition refines and expands upon every topic, providing up-to-date information on recent changes to MySQL and it's various forks. The new edition is well worth picking up, even if you have already read the 2nd edition cover-to-cover.
B00846REIS|3.0|If you loved the \\"Shades of Gray\\" books you will find many similarities. That being said it is still a very enjoyable read in that same genre, with steamy, tension filled romance and vigorous sex. For those like me who love the escape it was well worth the time. I look forward to the next additon due out soon.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is amazing, I am totally addicted to it! the only issue I have is it gets laggy sometimes, but I am not sure if its my phone or the game so five stars it is!!
1401322786|5.0|Albom's fingers on the keyboard turn out golden prose, whether a column or a book.  The Time Keeper is like a combination of precious metal.<br /><br />The story opens with Dor who lives four thousand years ago.  Albom's explanation of Dor's thought processes in figuring out numbers and time is pure gold.  God watched Dor while the world changed.  One day, in order to stop time, Dor climbs the Tower of Babel and is punished.<br /><br />The silver part of the novel is about a high-school girl named Sarah Lemon who is lonely and unloved.  She develops a crush on a classmate Ethan.  Sarah is eager for time to pass quickly before their first date.  Soon, though, her heart is broken, as happens to unpopular lonely high school girls.  Her life is tarnished.<br /><br />Our platinum character is Victor, the fourteenth richest man.  Money, however, cannot cure him when he has terminal kidney cancer.  However,  he has come up with an alternative use for his money.<br /><br />Dor, Sarah, Victor --- three very different, intertwined characters with different problems and needs and perspectives on Time.  Will they meet?  How, where, when?  How will they influence each other?  The answers to these questions are precious gems.<br /><br />This novel doesn't mention Eccelesiates 3, but it does tell us there is a time for everything: a time to be born, a time to die, a time to ..........  I tell you, it is time to read this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. it's seriously an addiction.  but I can't get the last two players. still definitely, recommend this game.:-)
B006LSZECO|1.0|Wasn't too thrilled with this book.  I skipped pages just so I can finish it quickly.  I would not recommend this book.

B007KZY1YY|4.0|Most unusual to see this type of thinking in a book. However, once started it was difficult to put it down. In many people's lives it may be natural to live in that way!
030758836X|2.0|I was so consumed with this book. I had recommended it to everyone! That is, until I finished it. SUCH a disappointing ending. NOTHING like how the rest of the book was written. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth about the author.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is fantastic, and gets better with repeated viewings. If you are into zombies, and/or British humor,  you can't go wrong this movie. I've been a fan of Simon Pegg for a long time, and this is probably the best movie he's ever done.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love it.  Love to explore and share whether its recipes or great ideas.  And being able to look back at them later on my boards.  Even future vacation spots.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is a great show, and I've recommended it to pretty much everyone that I know. The characters are warm, funny, and flawed in endearing ways. The comedy is delightful, often surprising, and great for families. The first season is definitely the best of the series.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I bought this device to listen to a large audio library on CD. I copied it to a thumb drive and it works great. I give this high ratings because of the signal strength.<br /><br />Tip: Just because you find a frequency that sounds dead, doesn't mean it's the best to use as I found many times a frequency that seems to have distant stations coming through from time to time with the FM transmitter turned off, might be better than a frequency that is almost silent. I also used this device in a two state area and found a couple of frequencies that worked best and the device made it simple to change while driving.<br /><br />The cons to this device (that I placed little weigh on in my rating) is the screen is hard to see. I think a bright LED would be better than an LCD. This also ties into the remote. If the remote was well laid out, the screen would be less significant. I think others agree the fast forward and skip isn't logically laid out to use while driving since you have to take your eye off the road to see your finger placement on the remote. This probably impacts me more since I am listing to chapters of a book and it's very frustrating to fast forward past something you already heard and made a mistake of skipping to the next chapter.<br /><br />All in all, I would say this is much better made than I expected and many more features than I expected. You can't go wrong with this one.
0393343405|3.0|Greenblatt is an engaging writer who can make a fairly mundane subject such as the discovery of an ancient manuscript into something that seems more interesting than it really is.  I loved his previous work, Will In the World, and expected more of the same here, especially after the Swerve won the Pulitzer.  But it doesn't live up to the Shakespeare book at all.  I think the Pulitzer committee gave its award for this book as a \\"makeup call\\" after failing to grant their award to Will.<br /><br />I think this book was overhyped too.  To claim that the finding of the manuscript by Lucretius made the world become modern is way overblown. Lucretius poem, On the Nature of Things, was a remarkably prescient document summarizing Epicurean philosophy, but hardly had the impact this book claims.  (I blame the publisher's marketing department rather than Greenblatt for the subtitle).  I will look forward to Greenblatt's next book and  hope it lives up to Will in the World rather than The Swerve.
B008602KQI|5.0|the movie is great and the actors make you believe the turmoil they live in.  The extra's tell the story behind the story - interesting.
B000V39KDO|5.0|300 is a awesome movie.Love the action scences.The special effects on this movie is awesome.Everything about the movie is awesome.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|I have always wanted to see the film which was based on Dennis Lehane's book.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the movie followed the sequence of events as described in the book.  Leonardo Dicaprio gives an outstanding performance of Teddy Daniels.  Also Ben Kingsley is great as Dr. Crawley.  The atmosphere and scenery are appropriately dark and ominous.  Also I enjoyed seeing Mark Ruffalo as Leonard Sheehan -- he was very convincing as Chuck Aule, Teddy's partner in solving the mystery of where and how did Rachel Solando escape from mental institution.  This is a roller coaster ride, taking you into dark and frightening realms, getting lost on an island with hurricane winds threatening to wipe out everything.  Your nerves will be shattered by the end of the movie.  It will boggle your mind as nobody is what he appears to be.  I was not surprised by the ending as I had read the book, but if you are not prepared for how it ends, it will leave you reeling and haunt your thoughts long after the end.  Martin Scorcesse is a master film maker and as always he delivers a superb film.  As a warning to parents, there is a great deal of violence and profanity.  Children younger than 18 should probably not see this one.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|I guess I wanted to see how the story ended, and if it had any redeeming features that I must have missed in the first 2 books. Nope - just a couple of hours wasted reading poorly written rubbish. I don't think I have ever worked out what the hype has been about
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give this book a zero I would. Someone recommended this book and I cannot finish it. I might try to finish because I paid for it. I just cannot see why this is a best seller. It is awful. It sucks. This is the worse book I have ever read. How did it make it on the best seller list and authors that deserve to be on the list did not make it. I just do not understand it. This book is sickening. I hated it and glad I did not buy part 2 and 3. How can there be 3 books on this crap. I hate it and a waste of money. I try to read it to see what the hype was about and I cannot find any good  thing to say about this book. Ugggg.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|Brilliant, different, full of intrigue, great cast, great effects, first class show.  Plot keeps you tied to your seat with expectation. Bit graphic in some places, but love the story, even the funky intro music.  Very entertaining, and fortunately, not trashy as so many great shows over time seem to turn into.  This show remains fantastic, exceptional.  It engages your imagination, and really does touch the fringe of the realm of what currently is and isn't possible with science experiment's today. Looking forward to the final Season 5, so thankful for a wonderful true science fiction show, and it will be missed when it's over.  Marvelous and gripping.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought the movie was excellent and kept very close to the book.  There were incidents that were left out of the movie but if you put everything into the movie it would be 6 hours long or longer.  I didn't think it hurt the movie to leave things out, but i probably would have picked different things to leave out.. or shorten some scenes so as to get some important scenes in that would have made other parts make more sense.  I loved it!

B006YJMYK0|3.0|GOOD:  It's the soundtrack to Jurassic Park, one of my favorites from composer John Williams.<br /><br />BAD:  I use very high-quality headphones when listening to my music and I can hear the compression in some of the tracks.  Those that were recorded at 192kb and higher sound excellent, but if they dip below that (and I believe these were encoded with a variable bitrate), I can hear the compression in the high notes of some of the pieces.  It detracts from an otherwise superb album.  Will most people hear this compression, no, but audiophiles may be a bit disappointed.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Audiophiles, if you really want this album, buy the CD and make your own mp3s.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is a very nice, quality headset. Personally I've gone through Four wired headsets in the past 2 years which is incredibly frustrating and this headset keeps me from damaging its wires, because it doesn't have any!<br /><br />The sound quality is quite nice, has a surround sound function that works pretty well to be honest.<br /><br />The mic is good quality, doesn't tend to pick up fan noises, you simply push up to mute, whats not to love?<br /><br />Headset works across my apartment, the keys on the side let you skip songs, increase volume, play pause. I Really like this headset, you should get one.
B008K3HRF0|4.0|I had to buy the lorax movie even though I wanted to rent it first to see if I would like it. The movie was not for rental at that time so I had to buy it because my kids and I wanted to really watch it.  I am happy though that I bought it because we enjoyed it very much.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|A Wanted Man has managed to put me into a dilemma. How do I rate this book? Should I give it a four star or a three star review? At first I went for four, but then I've changed my mind, since, well, this is Lee Child we're talking about and, like it or not, we expect better from him.<br /><br />No, I'm not saying that this is not a good book, it is; what I'm saying is that it could be much better. To start with it could be a bit, or rather more than a bit, shorter. There's just not enough juice in the story, to make it so long, and I think the author himself knew that, and that's why he started improvising, adding math statistics and... blinks into the equation. Then there are some overwritten scenes. And finally we have that one-man-army act that's really hard to believe even if you are a hardcore Jack Reacher fan.<br /><br />To the story now. It all begins when a car stops to give Reacher a ride in the dead of the night. There are two men and a woman in it, which of course, is not by itself something strange. What's strange though is the fact that even though the men seem to know each other well, the woman acts like she's a complete stranger, as if she doesn't belong there. And that, somehow, doesn't raise any alarms in Reacher's mind, though it does raise a couple of questions which he hurriedly brushes aside.<br /><br />The ride though will not prove as easy as he wanted it to be. For starters they encounter a couple of police roadblocks in the almost deserted highway leading away from Omaha, and then one of the men asks him to drive, something he's not too eager to do, since he's not the best of drivers.<br /><br />As the journey continues the mystery deepens, and as the background information accumulates, it starts to take form. Later rather than sooner Reacher realizes that there's something fishy going on. It's not only the men's disposition that makes him suspicious, but also the message, a kind of Morse-code-with-the-eyes that the woman, Karen, blinks to him from the back sit: M-Y-C-A-R.<br /><br />By the time he decides to take action though it's too late already. He's left behind at a motel reception, after an incident with one of the men, and now he's determined to right his wrongs and save the woman from whatever the two perps have in store for her. But to do that he needs help, which he receives from an unexpected source: a female agent of the FBI.<br /><br />Despite the fact that they are suspicious of each other, the two of them decide to work together for the hostage's sake, while trying at the same time to sort out, how it all began. In the meantime, the CIA and the State Department are trying to intervene with the case, and as the truth comes out bit by bit, we come to realize that there's more to the story than we thought. The finale arrives with a bang, but the slow-drawn events that led to it, take away some of the reading pleasure.im from the back sit: M-Y-C-A-R.<br /><br />By the time he decides to take action though it's too late already.

1439102430|4.0|In Bones Are Forever it all begins with the discovery of the corpses of three newborn, at different time periods, babies in an apartment in Montreal, Canada.<br /><br />Dr. Temperance Brennan is of course at the scene and what she sees really upsets her, something that doesn't happen quite so often, if at all. Tempe cannot help but wonder what was it that made the mother of these children kill them. Was she really a monster? She had to be. And she's on the loose.<br /><br />However, the case is not as simple as it looks. Amy Roberts, or Alma Rogers, or Annaliese Ruben, is not who she seems to be. The cops are certain she is a prostitute and they are close to the truth, but at the same time they couldn't be any farther from it, as Annaliese has a dark past, and more than one secrets.<br /><br />What's the most important thing now though is to find her, and that will not prove such an easy thing to do, since after she paid a visit to a hospital the previous night, she somehow managed to vanish into thin air.<br /><br />Brennan and her part-time partner and ex-lover Andrew Ryan, are determined to find her, but to do that they first have to find who she really is, where did she come from and if she has a place to return to. Thus in comes Sergeant Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Isaac Hasty, a man with whom Brennan had a fling in the past, and who works in Edmonton in Kare, a police division whose sole aim is to protect prostitutes from the predators.<br /><br />Hasty knows some of Annaliese's back story, but not all of it, and doesn't seem to get along with Ryan all that well. Is it because of Brennan, or did the latter provoke him somehow, with his inappropriately sarcastic mood? Or is it the other way around?<br /><br />Ryan doesn't seem to be himself these days, but Brennan just doesn't have the time to sit down and talks things out with him, since they have a scorching hot case to solve. And so begins a journey; a journey that will first lead them to Edmonton, where Annaliese has been spotted, and from there on to Yellowknife, a frozen city in the far north, her hometown.<br /><br />During it Brennan will meet some colorful characters, create a few enemies, reminiscence about the past and the death of her beloved brother Kevin, think about Katy, her stubborn and independent daughter, learn the history of the region, and come face to face with death time and again.<br /><br />In the end what started as an investigation for the wrongdoings of a woman, will develop into a journey into the psyches of some greedy people and their dark plans for wealth and power. And Brennan, who's a fact junky, will at some point come to realize that what things seem are not always what things are.<br /><br />There's a lot of pain in this story, and not too many light touches of humor, but it rolls along in a good pace, and even though the plot at some points seems to leak, the reader's interest remains high from the first page to the last.en spotted, and from there on to Yellowknife, a frozen city in the far north, her hometown.<br /><br />During it Brennan will meet some colorful characters, create a few enemies, reminiscence about the past and the death of her beloved brother Kevin, think about Katy, her stubborn and independent daughter, learn the history of the region, and come face to face with death time and again.<br /><br />In the end what started as an investigation for the wrongdoings of a woman, will develop into a journey into the psyches of some greedy people and their dark plans for wealth and power.

B004RCUJ9E|5.0|I downloaded this item to try and teach my four year old grandson about checkers. He learned quite quickly because the move options are clearly marked. Even his two year old brother seemed to understand the moving part. Now all they need is the strategy of the game, and that will come with practice.
B0086700CM|2.0|This game lags.  Way more than it should. It is okay kn the first couple times, then it's just plain ole' sucky.
B002PA8Q1S|3.0|Have any of you actually read American Psycho? I assume that the director of this film did not, because Christian Bale is so obviously wrong for the role of Patrick Bateman that I was cringing every time he opened his mouth. Don't get me wrong--I like Christian Bale. I think he's an incredible (and heartbreakingly attractive) actor, but his ability to portray tortured souls that he has become so well known for is not at all apparent in this film, which arguably features the most tortured soul (Patrick Bateman) of any of Bale's roles. Patrick Bateman is a sadistic, cruel, knee-buckling misogynist in the novel with a crippling self-conscious streak who tortures and kills his victims in such horrifying ways that I felt physically ill reading about them. This is not the same Patrick Bateman Bale's performance provides us with, however. Instead, we are introduced to a dashing young man who, although admittedly tortures women, has a cute enough smile and mild enough demeanor that we find ourselves almost siding with him, much in the way Showtime's Dexter cultivates viewer empathy. I admit that this softened version of Mr. Bateman does not necessarily distract from the film's message, but it drastically mutes the sinister undertone and character complexity that made Brett Easton Ellis's novel so infamous in the first place.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I was a late comer to this game, but once we installed it, it was an instant hit. Everyone in the house can and does play for hours on end.<br /><br />The limited levels and ads are a bit frustrating, but it was free. We ended up buying the paid version as well, once we had to reset the tablet for other reasons. Could have installed the free one, but it seemed like the time to pay up and support the developer.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|They rushed the story, screwed up just about every major point of the book, got rid of Molly and most of the makeup artists that helped Cinna, Woody acted way too sober to be Haymitch, the \\"girl on fire\\" dress wasn't impressive at all compared to how the book described it, I couldn't get a feel for any of the characters, and overall I felt like if I didn't read the books, I wouldn't have a clue what the hell the movie was about. After being let down by how the third book was written and seeing this movie, I'm under the impression that the author doesn't care about her audience because now she's making bank.

B001UU045A|5.0|This is one of those shows that once you see the first couple of episodes you will get hooked on it. This show kind of reminds me of Torchwood (BBC). I love all the characters plus the stories are great.<br />I just started watching this show 1 week ago and I'm already up to the middle of the 2nd season.<br /><br />If you love either Sci-Fi or any of the cop type crime shows you will definatly love this show.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game...except I was on level 82 or so and it all disappeared ...if you can figure out how to bring back my game, I'd love it more...
B007Z9QWVK|3.0|With the box office results from this movie I am convinced that people stayed away just because it was a Madonna film.  I think she may have gotten a bad break because, as a movie buff and a fan of period pieces I enjoyed the movie very much.  I thought that some of the advertisement for it could have much better, but the movie itself was interesting and watchable, and at least as good as many I have seen that got a much higher rating.  I give at least 3 stars and enjoyed the cinematography, the clothes, and some of the scenes were amazing ... one in particular I will not forget ... with the camera on Wallis,  watching a tear form and fall from her eye ... beautiful.
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Consistent as always. Jack White has produced another amazing album. Worth every penny. Matches his work with the white stripes an the raconteurs. Keep it coming Jack
B008EEB4TA|4.0|Of course all is well in the technical aspect. Full album and all. The album is much different than her previous work...a bit more \\"main-stream\\" than I'd like it to be but the lyrics still sound like her, for the most part. I don't think anyone would be too disappointed with her on this--she's experimenting. She's an artist. It's what they do. We just pray and hope it's nothing too radical-and this is not..so...Listen to it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I bought this game shortly before going to a convention to give my group something to do in line and it did not disappoint.  This is an easy to learn game that anyone can pick up in a few minutes, and it's small and portable enough that you can play it anywhere.  I'm no dice expert but they seem to be durable enough, they have been dropped from about 6 feet onto a hard concrete surface with no chips or dings that I have seen.  The only issue that I have with this game is the cardboard zombie tube that it comes with.  I would recommend replacing this with a bag instead so you can just draw dice out of it if you are standing and don't have a surface to roll the dice on.  This is by no means a dealbreaker though, I highly recommend this game and the expansion.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The acting is impeccable and this shows the slippery slide you have begun once you let your values be corrupted. I highly recommend this season but it is NOT for the squeamish.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Bought it on my Kindle and couldn't put it down. Story of tremendous courage,  determination and perseverance. Great read that I would highly recommend
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am such a big fan of Pinterest. I was so excited to see there was finally an app for it. I downloaded this on my Kindle Fire. I use it almost everyday and I love it. Works great !
B007JRU2UK|1.0|We never got to watch the movie as it was deleted from my Kindle before I could watch it.  There should be more than a 24 hour window!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great sci- fi book with details that take you below the depths of the earth into the Silo that would be the perfect home, except for the fact that independent thinking could get your clock cleaned in more ways than one.  It's a must read for those of us who like intrigue and the unexpected.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The film paralleled the book quite well with only slight modifications. I appreciated their effort to maintain the integrity of the book, which I enjoyed. The movie was well done!!

B008M34INW|4.0|Thought Gibson was at his best. Lots of action and a good 'shoot-em-up'. Never got bored with the movie. Started out with a bang and though the plot became a little predictable towards the end I had a good time watching it.
B005LAIGLE|5.0|In a word........awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />In a few words....this one keeps you sitting on the edge of your seat, action packed, I loved it.....loved the pace, loved the guns, loved the twists and turns, loved the sexy boy Mark Wahlberg......just loved everything......GREAT VIEWING!
B0060YIBLK|5.0|Lots of common sense tips.  Certainly useful for those having regular contact with external or internal customers.  Really boils down to use having two ears and one mouth.  This book provides practical advice on how to be a more effective listener.
B008602KQI|5.0|Loved the movie. I didn't read the book and was afraid that it was going to be one of those bloody epics like the titan movies but was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Woody Harrelson surprised me with an outstanding performance. As expected, Jennifer Lawrence showed that she is an extremely talented actress. She was outstanding as Ree in \\"Winter's Bone\\" and certainly equaled her performance as Katnis Everdeen. Expecting to see another Oscar Nomination here.<br /><br />Added 10/13/2012<br />After reading some of the poor reviews I decided to read the book and see what they are all complaining about. I agree that the book is much more detailed than the movie. It spends a lot of time explaining the past and goes into more detail during the games itself. I also agree that reading the book first will make the movie more understandable; however to cover all that detail in the movie would make it about 6 or more hours long. The movie follows the book with very few exceptions. The biggest one being how Katniss gets the mockingjay pin but it doesn't affect the story line at all. I totally disagree that the acting was poor. The characters are portrayed as weird in the movie because they are a perfect match to the characters in the book.<br />Even though i would recommend that you read the book first, whether you do or not doesn't change my 5 star rating. I bought the 3 book trilogy at Amazon at a very reasonable price and am in the process of reading volume 2 \\"Catching fire\\"
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love the game my son also love the game great time waste game kill lots of zombie. get the game
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I can not wait until the next book comes out! I thought it was just like Fifty Shades, only better without the heroine commenting \\"oh crap\\" all the time! It's a must read if you enjoyed the Fifty Shades books!
030758836X|1.0|I thought I was buying a mystery and/or thriller. It is neither. It is a book about two ridiculous people wrapped in an inane plot, a few witty lines and utter lack of any credibility.  It a tedious read with no redeeming features. I do not normally write book reviews but I found this book so bad and a waste of the money it cost to buy it. To repeat, do not buy this book.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This was a great read, and after having watched the movie it was great to read the book and compare the two.<br />I would certainly reccomend it for others to read.<br />Having the book available in an Ebook, is fantastic, no more bookmarks needed, or bent pages, it is so simple and easy to read.<br />If you haven't read the book, give it a go!
B004SSCWYC|3.0|I have to say that this episode is good, which is a nice break during a bad season.  I thought Olivia pulled off Bell's voice very well, but I do hope Bell finds another host soon.  I'm really not digging the story line this season, but this episode gave me hope that it might get better.  I don't know,maybe they need some new writers for fresh ideas.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After reading the hunger games series I was extremely excited to watch the film. But I must say, it was a decent attempt, but as usual the book is far better than the movie. I don't know if the production company thought showing children involved in the violence of the book would be upsetting to the Viewers or if they were shooting for a younger target audience like Harry potter, but the film lacks the edge of your seat feel that you get from the book. The moments of hopelessness, the pain, the transformation from human to beast of survival is not apparent in the movie. Like I said, a good attempt. Just lacking on some key elements in my opinion.
B004ZP37HE|3.0|it's a good thing this season ending is good, otherwise I doubt I'd even try to watch next season.  As it is, though, it was less boring than the other shows this season, and now I want to find out what's going to happen. But if season 4 is as boring as this one, I won't bother sloughing through it.  So here's hoping....
B00571F26Y|5.0|I lost over 12lbs in the first 3 weeks just by eliminated wheat products in my breakfast and lunch routines. I have not deprived myself at all. I had not been able to lose weight prior to that for almost 2 years. The issues and data are very compelling and it does not hurt to try it. Wheat is not completely gone from my diet but I'm working on it.
B00062PN6I|5.0|If you have a class to teach or a couple kids that need a pair, these are great. At under 10 USD each they have proven to be quite durable. Isolation leaves something to be desired but the fact that the contacts are gold plated and the cords aren't snapping is enough to get me to order them again.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is NOT like a box of chocolates, you always know what you are going to get! One great movie! This is a classic! I honestly have this on my \\"I could watch this movie everyday\\" list! BUY IT and LOVE IT!!!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I'd actually give it 4.5 stars or so, but since that's not an option and I feel it's underrated, I'm giving it 5.  For me it took a while to really draw me into the story, but once I got into the story, it was worth it.  So don't give up if it starts out slow.  You'll be glad you kept reading.  The third book also started out a bit slow for me, the entire trilogy is definitely worth the read. I barely put my Kindle down till I finished all 3 books.  I wish it wasn't over, but I thought the ending was very well written. And I pretty much never think that :)
B007FU1OH6|4.0|In similar vein to Shadow of the Wind, the story enthralls with a number of twists and turns and lucky escapes.  I think the unexpected death of the one handed gangster was a bit of an anti-climax and failed to maintain the tension of the moment of the missing money from the locker.  In general, a darn good yarn.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The story is ok so far. I wish the author would use words other than 'murmur' & 'mutter'. There's a lot of repetition which can be annoying at time. I found myself skipping some parts...
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love it, so easy to look at and pin to your boards. No problems, just be careful because you won't be able to put it down or look away!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The app seems to be cleanly and efficiently implemented with a very reasonable feature set.  I especially appreciate the time remaining by function information.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book!  I have no problem giving this book a 5 star rating.  It is well worth it.  I've also recently purchased the Ender #2 book, Speaker for the Dead, and can't wait to get started on it.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I read this book after reading Gone Girl.  Did not like this book nearly as well.  Seems Gillian Flynn has gotten better with experience in my opinion.  This book was too dark for me, although it did hold my interest for most of it.
B0038QGXHW|3.0|I have to admit that my review appears to be contrary to the popular view of this release by Keith Jarrett and Charlie Haden. I think I appreciate a different aesthetic when it comes to jazz, especially piano jazz, and most especially piano jazz by Keith Jarrett. In the liner notes of this CD, Jarrett says that \\"I wanted only the distilled essence of what we had, and it took some time to wean ourselves from going for hip solos or unevenly played tunes (even though they had wonderful things inside them.\\"<br /><br />My chief problem with this CD is that I am actually LOOKING for hip solos and for unevently played tunes with wonderful things inside them, because to me, that is the essence of jazz: taking chances and going for broke, NOT artificially restraining oneself in order to play ONLY the \\"essence\\" of the tune. The result of all too much restraint is boring, non-adventurous performances that don't stray far from the straight-ahead melody. If I just wanted to hear the melody and very slight departures from the melody, I would listen to non-jazz performances of them.<br /><br />There are simply very few sparks of genius or breathtaking melodic adventures here. For the most part, any competent journeyman jazz player could replicate these performances without breaking a sweat. Maybe I'm missing something here, but that's the way I feel.<br /><br />There are notable departures from this formula: Body and Soul is a gorgeous, sustained journey into reharmonization and near-recomposition, and I enjoy this performance immensely.<br /><br />Perhaps this release is most enjoyable late at night, when up-tempo, dizzying improvisations can come across as too much. This is romantic ear candy for late night listening. Enjoy it as such, and you won't be disappointed.

B004PGNB1K|5.0|Fantasy novels have become pretty rote for a number of year now.  The Wise Man's Fear (and it's predecessor) have been a true joy to discover and read.  Mr Rothfuss has a genuine talent for intrigue and storytelling.  I can hardly wait until the next installment of the series.

B008XG1X18|4.0|It has a lot to offer. I'm happy with this app. It gives me a lot of inspiration! I love this app!
B00845PV16|3.0|I found this movie to be a let down compared to the first ghost Rider movie. This 1 seems to be kind of thrown together with just punched in action instead of the firm solid storyline that the first offers. If you're looking for a way to kill a couple hours this is okay to watch. If you're looking for something to make you want more this 1 is not for you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book told you about the past lives of Anna & Christian and brought you to understand them more specially Christian and why he acts so cold and grey most of the time. In the end it turned out to be everything you had hoped that would happen. Like the other two books this was just as hard to put down because you got so caught up in the story. Its a must read and I just wished there would of been a 4th book to read. I give this book a 5 star.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A lot of great twists and turns, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned...especially a psychopath.  Very creepy ending.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This was a big hit, but I was shocked at how small it was.  For the money, I thought it would be bigger.  It was about the same size as the box.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was hooked from the beginning. Great story, riveting central character, everything anyone could ask for in a Fantasy novel. Try a sample on your e-reader, you won't be disappointed. Looking forward to the next book in this series.
B006ID01OS|5.0|This is a book is a solid investment for the time it takes to read.  Like all good work on strategy, you'll often say to yourself \\"of course\\" or \\"that's not news\\" because good strategic thought is good solid thinking.  I think the great value that this book offers the reader is the rapid dissemination of the author's content and then an immediate method to systematically apply it.  That is, she offers a 200 page guide for someone to immediately put into practice. You'll quickly be able to align your company's purpose with the disciplines' focused evaluation as to whether each is either in support of that purpose, or not.  And then ultimately, whether that core purpose/core value proposition is right, or not.  It would be hard to believe that the senior team of any organization would find the book, or its method, to be a waste of time - either in the creation stage of an enterprise or probably most broadly applicable, against a going concern.  You'll probably want it in printed form, on your shelf, as it will serve as a resource to be revisited.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|I wasnt expecting this to be that good since anything after the original gets bad but this one was pretty funny. I reccomend it if you like the American Pie movies
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Good, easy to read graphical representation of battery usage. A nice, functioning utility app is too often under-appreciated. Get it.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|An old soundtrack but still great start to finish it never gets old! Originally got this soundtrack as a gift but I left it in a cd player of a car that had been totaled. The days without my new moon were terrible. What I especially love is watching the movie and hearing all of the songs and knowing each and every one of them. Listening also reminds me of the movie and flashes me back to the certain points in the movie. Great CD!!

B004AOECUG|5.0|Legend has it that Martin Scorsese intended \\"Raging Bull\\" (1980) as the last movie he would ever make.<br /><br />Still reeling from the box-office disappointment of \\"New York, New York\\" (1977), recovering from his drug addictions and witnessing American cinema's transition from the 1970s New Hollywood period into the modern blockbuster era, Scorsese mustered all his energy, all his strength, all his cinematic knowledge to create a movie that was so raw, so uncompromising that any suggestion that the movie would achieve box-office glory was out of the question. \\"Raging Bull\\" was meant to be culmination of Martin Scorsese's undisputed talents as a filmmaker and his last attempt to be heard among American moviegoers. Thankfully, the latter was not the case as Scorsese continued to make more movies but \\"Raging Bull\\" undeniably stands as his magnum opus. Even though \\"Taxi Driver\\" and \\"GoodFellas\\" were more popular movies, it's safe to say no other Martin Scorsese movie (or few movies in general) was as powerful, devastating and hard to watch as \\"Raging Bull\\".<br /><br />Like many of the great gangster movies of the 30s-60s, \\"Raging Bull\\" depicts the rise and turbulent fall of a flawed hero but hero is used in a very loose sense here. The hero in \\"Raging Bull\\", middleweight boxer Jake La Motta, is a despicable, ignorant and antisocial brute whose overbearing machismo, violent behavior and sexual insecurity made him a menace inside and outside the ring. No one was safe from La Motta's wrath, not his opponents, his brother, his wife or even himself. \\"Raging Bull\\" unflinchingly depicts the spectacular fall of Jake La Motta as he goes from a dangerous success story in the ring to a miserable failure as a brother, husband and a man.<br /><br />Robert De Niro's Oscar-winning performance as La Motta is one of the greatest achievements in acting history: De Niro invests every raw emotion into his character, revealing La Motta to be as a self-destructive and insecure human being who sees violence as the answer to everything. Rather he tells his brother Joe to punch him for having \\"girly hands\\", tormenting his wife when he senses her cheating, beating up guys so that they're \\"not pretty anymore\\" or hitting the wall in self-hatred when he reaches the lowest moment of his life, De Niro ignites the screen with the fury of a raging boxer. It's easy to mock the fact that De Niro gained 30-50 pounds to play La Motta in his later years but it's no publicity stunt; the emotional and physical weight that De Niro bestows on his character reveals a raging bull that cannot be tamed.<br /><br />Besides De Niro, the other performances in \\"Raging Bull\\" are absolutely superlative including Cathy Moriarty as De Niro's wife Vicki and Joe Pesci as Jake's manager brother Joe. One of the most memorable scenes in \\"Raging Bull\\" is not the brutal boxing scenes but set in a living room where Jake suspiciously believes that Joe is having an affair with his wife Vicki. In the midst of verbal fisticuffs (\\"Did you f--- my wife?\\"), it is the way De Niro shows the inner twisting logic of his jealousy that speaks volumes.<br /><br />Besides the magnificent acting, the movie represents a cinematic peak for Scorsese and his crew. By shooting the film in black and white, Scorsese gave the picture a gritty, unrefined style that combined elements of film noir with the rawness of John Cassavetes movies; the Bronx has never looked hotter and more dangerous. Thelma Schoonmaker's editing and Michael Champman's cinematography are absolutely outstanding, particularly in the fights between Sugar Ray Robinson and La Motta where they make those scenes look savage and poetic through slow motion, off-kilter camera angles and rapid edits. To make the boxing scenes more grisly, the crew even made use of animal sound effects!<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull\\" was voted by several critics as the best movie of the 1980s. For once, the superlatives do not lie. \\"Raging Bull\\" is an encompassing masterpiece that does not date but grows through the passage of time. \\"GoodFellas\\", \\"Casino\\" and \\"The Departed\\" are outstanding movies but for my money, no one involved in this great movie (not even Scorsese) has done better work since. This movie is more than a classic; it's an imperishable work of art.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy at all costse that does not date but grows through the passage of time. \\"GoodFellas\\", \\"Casino\\" and \\"The Departed\\" are outstanding movies but for my money, no one involved in this great movie (not even Scorsese) has done better work since.

B000002U82|5.0|One of the most successful rock albums of all time, selling 50 million copies worldwide and staying on the Billboard 200 charts for an extraordinary 741 weeks between 1973 to 1988. But to judge \\"Dark Side\\" solely on its commercial success is to overlook the artistic merits that the album possesses. Time has done nothing but burnish the brilliance of Pink Floyd's magnum opus, their major breakthrough into the US mainstream and an album that has justly earned its place as one of the greatest rock albums ever made.<br /><br />Pink Floyd are a progressive rock band that even people that hate progressive rock bands love. It's easy to see why: many progressive rock bands like Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rush, Yes, Procol Harum and the Moody Blues made music that was too excessive for anyone's taste, creating records that were long-winded, pretentious and often mistaking bombast for majesty (And indeed, is there anything more bombastic than a band releasing three one-sided solo albums under its own name, as ELP did with \\"Works\\"?). Pink Floyd's music was long, meticulous and epic as well but it possessed a strong simple musicality that made Floyd's music a pleasure to listen to, even for fans that disdained space rock. It also helped that they had one of the greatest songwriters of all time in Roger Waters, the band's bassist. In short, they made meticulously detailed music that was filled with emotion, intellect and melody.<br /><br />\\"Dark Side\\", which was their eighth studio album, crystallizes that attitude more than anything. In all the nine songs of \\"Dark Side\\", Roger Waters, along with guitarist David Gilmour, keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason, evoked big, universal landscapes of human crises, governmental incompetence and mundane everyday living, tackling themes such as conflict, consumerism, passage of time, fear of death, madness and the follies of war. The concepts are simple enough but given the backdrop of atmospheric soundspaces, creative sound effects and elements of blues, jazz and art-rock thrown in for good measure, the album as a whole becomes transcendent.<br /><br />Each of the nine songs is a classic in itself but the best and appropriate way to enjoy the album is to listen to it from beginning to end, the way it was intended. It may seem like a chore but on an absorbing album like \\"Dark Side\\", such complaints hardly matter since the music is great. It is still a revelation to hear how the first side begins with the subtle sound collage of \\"Speak to Me\\" and then transiting into the leisurely paced sigh of \\"Breathe\\" before fading into the aural frenzy of \\"On the Run\\" and then into the neo-psychedelic rocker \\"Time\\" and finally the soulful piano-based instrumental \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", the latter featuring a chilling vocal performance by Claire Torry. Side two follows suit starting with the blues-rock classic \\"Money\\", then fading into the somber jazz-fused \\"Us and Them\\", the trippy psychedelia of \\"Any Colour You Like\\" and concluding with the double whopper in \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\". Some of these songs, particularly \\"Time\\", \\"Money\\" and \\"Us and Them\\" are classic singles but listening to the whole album is more essential since it achieves greater emotional resonance and lure listeners into a dark, haunting world of feeble human conditions.<br /><br />The production in \\"Dark Side\\" is just extraordinary. After all, there's a reason why \\"Dark Side\\" is regarded as one of the best-produced rock albums ever made. Check out \\"Money\\", which begins with the clattering of cash registers before one of the most recognizable basslines is played and the band goes into a blues frenzy featuring a great saxophone solo by Dick Parry and a rip-roaring guitar solo by David Gilmour. Similarly, \\"Time\\" begins with a long introductory passage of clocks chirming and alarms ringing, followed by a two-minute drum solo from Mason and then a neo-psychedelic workout containing Gilmour singing the verses and RichardWright singing the bridge about how time slips by. Each song possesses a strong identity that makes one distinctive from another and the combination of Waters' poetic lyrics and awesome production make this a gripping listen for even those that hate prog rock. That this album came out at a time before digital technology and Pro Tools became a norm makes it even more relevant today than it did back in '73.<br /><br />Pink Floyd was a band of great talent and ambition but it was also a band that had many naysayers. Many rock critics, particularly those in the late 1970s, slammed Pink Floyd as the apotheosis of stale, boring dinosaur rock music while praising punk rock albums like the Sex Pistols' \\"Never Mind the Bullocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\\", the Vibrators' \\"Pure Mania\\" and the Damned's \\"Damned Damned Damned\\". Oddly enough, though, it is THOSE albums - not \\"Dark Side\\" - which sound dated today.<br /><br />Such charges that Pink Floyd were a boring, dinosaur act are understandable in the light of the late 1980s when Floyd reformed and released four terrible albums (two studio, two live) that earned a lot of money but created the false impression that they were a glorified oldies band. But in the 1970s, Pink Floyd were one of the best and most intelligent rock bands of all time. Every album they made in the 70's - \\"Meddle\\", \\"Dark Side\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\", as well as underrated gems like \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" and the second side of \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" - were powerful parables of everyday life, told with fearsome intellect and crafted with melodic precision, atmospheric aura and emotional power. Their music is far more timeless and modern than Johnny Rotten whining about the state of England.<br /><br />It's been joked around that \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is best heard when you are under the influence of drugs such as acid and pills. Sorry, but such a feeble statement does this album a great disservice. I did not need to take drugs to recognize the greatness of \\"Dark Side\\". Even as sober, I knew I had witnessed something never heard before and probably never again in the nearby future. \\"Dark Side\\" is that lightning-in-the-bottle CD where four talented musicians got together and created an imperishable work of art that will endure, no matter how many musical changes occur, how many trends are set or how many decades have gone by.<br /><br />\\"Dark Side\\" deservedly earns its place as one of the all-time great rock albums. Simply put, if you don't have this album in your CD collection, don't bother to have one.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation to buy at all costs.Wright singing the bridge about how time slips by.

B008ASLK8A|5.0|I love these interpretations of this story line.  It is fast paced and keeps you thinking and anticipating the next twist of events.
B0068C9W44|5.0|I purchased this Rihanna album after hearing some of these tracks on Spotify. I don't follow much of the current pop music scene, but I love electronic dance tracks with decent lyrics. Although I wasn't a fan of her when she came out with \\"Umbrella,\\" I have definitely enjoyed her aggressive and energetic style on this album. It might not be for everyone, but I don't regret getting this when I was able to get it on sale for $5. For that price, it was a steal and I still enjoy hearing her songs since getting it about a month ago.
B0086DBE62|3.0|Was an entertaining take off on the tale, interesting acting, setting and effects.  Wouldn't watch with young children but makes for interesting discussions on comparing and contrasting of story versions for older children.
B005721W9O|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Several of my friends had been pestering me to watch it, and they were right. It is hilarious and engaging. I would rent it again.
B000000OF6|5.0|Good quality cd, with all the songs needed for a good library of Queen music.  Just add Inuendo CD, because is has songs that should have been on this greates hits version.  Can listen to this anytime.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|It's been years since I first read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I'm enjoying it all over again! It just gets better.
B000000OA6|5.0|Freddie saved his best for last.  He did a remarkable job even though he was ill.  Mr May, as usual, is superb on guitar.  This cd stays in my cd player.  If you like Queen, then owning this cd is a must.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this science fiction flick. There was not a dull moment and it kept me interested from the beginning to end.
B0085A9J18|3.0|A movie with over-the-top violence from Indonesia? Ironically, how did it pass Islamic censorship?<br />Fourteen medical specialists and four massage therapists were needed on location and sets. That says something about enthusiasm and/or foolishness on the actor's parts.<br />Anyway, the following is all that need be said (as is usual in these movies; some may have resurrected themselves to die more than once):<br />Drug lab guards - 21 dead.<br />Carrying Bowo fighters -  18 dead.<br />Hole drop attackers - 18 dead.<br />Tama victims - 5 dead.<br />Riot van attackers - perhaps 6 dead.<br />15th floor attackers - 5 dead.<br />Snipers - perhaps 2 dead.<br />AK47 attackers - 5 dead.<br />Machete gang - 5 dead.<br />Special forces - around 18 dead.<br />Mad dog's men - 3 dead.<br />Andi's men - 2 dead.<br />Spotters - perhaps 2 dead.<br /><br />Surprisingly there was \\"some\\" decent acting & cinematography. Script was partially creative and partially been there, done that. About half of the martial arts were decently believable and the other half were old Hong Kong B movies not-so-believable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it, so many great party &amp; craft ideas, plus some yummy recipes, etc.  I really love the DIY's for the home too. I really like having one place that holds all my recipes, DIY's, etc.
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the books, saw the movie, bought it from Amazon for my daughter as soon as it came out.  In the past 2 weeks, she has watched it at least 6 times.  It's so well done.  I can't wait for the sequel.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I like this game, but I wish it would have come with some kind of instructions that would help you to manuver your way around the mansion. I unlocked several clues by spending a lot of time trying to figure it out, and now I'm stuck and can't figure out where to go next. This game would be better if some instructions, a map, or some kind of help was added to it. Its a fun game, just kind of frustrating when you get stuck and spend a lot of time doing nothing but going in circles.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Saw the movie in the Theaters, twice.  Had to get a copy when they came out.  One of the bettwe dystopian future movies.  While for time and format, thy had to make changes, the movie stays very close to the storyline.  Cannot wait for book 2! (Which I will also snag a personal copy of - legally!)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was definitely a little more dramatic than what I had expected! I had heard the reviews on radio stations about this book, so I knew I had to read it. I sure was in for a surprise on the basis of content this book evolves around. Its a love story, but has a kinky twist to it that you might not have expected. I can't wait to read the next book!
B007JMW46U|4.0|The Kindle book downloaded quickly and the short stories are extremely good.  Like both the Kindle and inexpensive books available from Amazon.
B00171NZE4|5.0|Fantastic concert i mean graphics and camera angles and sound were awesome and this is worth the money and am glad i bought it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to use this site to put all the things I love together. It Is also great to be able to share with other people:-)
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I have been enjoying Jeaniene Frost Huntress series.One Foot in the grave has been my favorite book so far, I cannot put down her books.I love Cat and Bones characters in the series. I highly recommend her books, they are intersting and fun to read.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite LOTR Lego set so far, and she's thirteen. Not only does it have a good deal of mini-figures for play once the set is complete, but has freestanding weapon to boot. It certainly wasn't the most challenging set she has put together by far, but the catapult actually works and rolls, and there were plenty to figures to wage a battle with once it was completed. The castle stands easily, even on carpet. I would recommend this set for any LOTR fan, Lego collector, and anyone who enjoys interactive play, \\"big\\" kid and \\"little\\" kid alike.
B007KZY1YY|2.0|Can't understand what all the noise is about - not being a female it all appears very banale and vanilla -  a not very original story written as an excuse to write about the physical side of sex. The romantic side is very tame and ineffective. A limited storyline and a struggle to write about genuine, credible characters. Maybe of interest to females? Not going to bother with the other two in the trilogy. Or am I missing something? Anyway I now know what people are talking about and still wondering \\"Why\\"?
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The graphics are GORGEOUS! The rules are simple and the puzzles start out easy but get progressively harder, as it should be. This is a great strategy game! Nice job!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I stumbled across this band on Pandora Radio, and something about their sound just clicked with me.  I can not give this album enough stars, absolutely worth the purchase!
B006OOHYIC|1.0|boring. this game has nothing new. same old same old. why can't anyone make something new and exciting? glad I didn't pay for this.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest! But the app on kindle fire has issues pulling up sometimes. Otherwise I prefer the app over the web version.
B000IZ8DZQ|5.0|The original version of the Italian job is a fun ride.  Action, scenery, heart-stopping stunts!  What more could you ask for?  I loved it!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first half of the novel was believable and well written.  Somewhere in the middle it just seemed to fall apart and became too preposterous to believe or enjoy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Life many other reviewers, I really liked the first half of the book and was almost going to start telling other people about it.  Then, the two timelines in the story collide and it went inexplicably downhill from there. Such a waste. Very unsatisfying. A good idea but not fully thought through.
B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Sort of an unusual book in that you completely wander off into sci- fi fiction combined with a heartbreaking historic event.  A young woman at the time, the retelling of names, dates and places has sent me to Wikipedia to find out what happened<br />to some of the real life characters and to refresh my memory.  Mr. King tactfully allows for Oswald did it versus conspiracy theorists so no matter what you believe he doesn't force his opinion on you.  He really does capture the \\"flavor\\" of the era.<br /> I thought it was a swell read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game its a lot of fun. the music is wonderful and the puzzles can be challenging,  but not frustrating or impossible
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I love the movie and have watched several times since I got it. I have recommended to some of my friends.
B005DVJQHY|4.0|The Master Key System makes clear how to tap into the power of our subconscious mind. I love the fact that even though Charles Haanel wrote this book so long before I was born, it is still very appropriate for those of us that truly believe that we can have greater power of mind and utilize this  power to achieve our deepest desires. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to change their lives to become more positive,productive and understands the law of attraction. I also like that it is done as a lesson, reading one chapter until you feel that you have mastered it.
B008602KQI|4.0|The Hunger Games Movie was everything I expected,since I had read all the books and am looking forward to additional movies !!!!!!!!!!
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Long story short: did not like this movie, was boring, dragged on forever and not even violent. WHAT WAS THE BIG DEAL ABOUT THIS MOVIE?!!!.
B0013F1D02|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and a perfect fairy tale story. The cast was wonderful and well picked and it was just a fantastic movie. I have not read the book yet, however the movie as a movie is just splendid.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read several reviews before buying and reading the books. Many people said, once they started one of the books, they couldn't stop until they finished it. I've just finished book 3 and i can say that all the positive reviews are true. If you start reading one of the books, you won't stop until you finished it. Five stars for a really great series (beware of sleepless nights)!
B002GY77KO|4.0|It's another very good CD but other's of theirs are much more interesting. They still have their heavy sound, which they have on every CD, but the spark of the songs and their arrangements don't have all the attention grabbing potential of other works. Don't get me wrong, I still like it very much but not every song, as I would on a number of their other CD's. There are only 2 or so tracks that I like the most and the others I could give or take. But... that in no way means I don't love \\"Lamb of God\\"!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci has done it again!  Great read with lots of twists and turns that make it hard to put the book down.  Fast paced Baldacci excellence!!
B005QUQ99K|5.0|Son was dying to get this Lego set.  I was afraid he would get bored trying to put this together.  Well my son loves it, and has built on to his collection with other ninja legos.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Heard coworkers raving about book so I got it on my kindle . Loved the book ! Was an easy read & characters  kept my interest- lots of twists to story!
1451648537|5.0|My husband purchased this book and is slowly reading through it.  He finds it very interesting, at first, he had a hard time getting started.<br /><br />The book itself is in find condition.  I don't remember if it was new or as good as new.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was the 2nd in the series so I did not expect much but the plot only thickened with the lead character! Recommend to all who liked the first Hunger Games book.
B003JTHESA|3.0|THE FINAL FRONTIER is another MAIDEN album full of LONG LONG songs, eternal guitar solos, and really not one great moment at all...of course is MAIDEN, you can hear Bruce´s voice and some interesting melodies...but, really, since DANCE OF DEATH, i feel MAIDEN is way uninspired...as other reviewers type, they only do LONG EPIC songs now, and seems like all the riffs are from other musics on ther past...i´m not expecting another PIECE OF MIND or other POWERSLAVE, and i think nobody expect this anymore, but seems like MAIDEN don´t want hits or remarkable songs anymore, and prefer to stick with those long progressive METAL songs....well, THE FINAL FRONTIER is not a great one from IRON MAIDEN....
B003O86FMW|5.0|freakin awesome  could not put it down i finished it in six hours my favorite book of all time wish s.collins would write another…! mrs.collins if u read these please write another ur #1 fan Shaun d. McCormick
B0012GN260|3.0|Bruce debut is good...it´s similar to the style Bruce incorporate in the early 90´s, with less screams and a more raw voice...There´s some classics from his solo career as the title track, BORN IN 58 and SON OF A GUN...well, it reminds me something from NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING, so it´s not really a incredible album like BALLS TO PICASSO and ACCIDENT OF BIRTH...if you like IRON MAIDEN or the solo Bruce stuff, you will enjoy TATTOOED MILLIONARE!!!!!!

B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is extremely well developed. I like how you can choose the number of pieces and whether or not you want the pieces to be rotated. That makes it great for all skill levels. It's also great that you can leave a puzzle incomplete and come back to finish it at a later time. I would definitely reccommend this app to anyone who enjoys puzzles!
B0000AUHOH|5.0|My service was fantastic, SPECTACULOUS even. I don't know why star trek V got such horrible reveiws and has been criticized so badly. I had to watch it just once to see and understand what William Shatners dream was all about and it sends a MESSAGE to all the people out there looking for the all famous ansewer. All of gods teachings are all in who you are and what's in your heart. The selfishness of wanting to know if he's really out there is obscure to the point of insanity. I have believed this my whole life. This movie to me was outstanding in my opinion and I could see how it was frowned upon. But what people should realize is that star trek is all about MORALITY PLAYS, which our society is lacking tremendously. Thank you, Ihave been trying to get this movie for 14 years and no one had it but you. Thanks again. Please send this to the company that mailed this movie to me. I LOVE IT, I HAVE THE WHOLE COLLECTION NOW!!!! FINALLY.
B00642ZOIG|5.0|Always enjoyed Crichton's work and was excited to find out that Preston was completing this project.  As expected, it was a very entertaining book to read and I could not put it down.
B00846REIS|3.0|Well all I can say is I felt like I was waiting for more. This was one of the books everyone said to read after the 50Shades series. It doesnt compare though. The main characters werent very developed and felt like it was rushed. Im not sure if the next book will develop the characters better but Im hoping so. They arent characters you can or want to root for like in the 50Shades series. MY best advise is to read this without trying to compare the two or you will be disappointed. Also I didnt care for some of the language used, the best part of Christian is he doesnt have to talk NASTY, dirty yes but not nasty. The F word is used alot in both but not some of the other language. Its nice to read a sexy, erotic book with out icky words used to describe female body parts. I think there are better words in the english language that can be used to describe whats happening and parts of the body. This is suppose to be sexy and seductive.Im just waiting for the next book to come out hoping for more depth to the characters.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I bought this for EVERYONE on my team. We'll see if it makes a difference? Isn't that the essence of a review. I put a hundred of my personal money to spread the world.
B008GX2YQQ|5.0|I don't understand why some people are giving this album poor ratings. Just because it's not MPP? This is ANIMAL COLLECTIVE, folks. They're too creative to stay the same with every release. To me, this is just another AnCo masterpiece. I just got this yesterday and I've listened to it multiple times. I'm listening to it now as I write this review actually! Give it a chance. It may not stick the first time so let it wash over you a few times. It just may surprise you.
B007R12TNQ|4.0|As a veteran of frame by frane cartoon animation (think Yogi Bear or Popeye) I was impressed by the computer animation in this movie. It was so fast in spots I almost could not follow it. Loved the Munks and their adventure. Great Family film.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|A great value if you enjoy sherlock holmes.  This collection will give the reader many hours of interesting reading of the great mysteries about the great detective.  I highly recommend this collection.  You can't beat the price and having all the stories in one volume is very convenient.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game to kill boredom. gives me something to do when I'm just sitting around at home, also the graphics are really cute
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is one of the most ridiculous books I have read.  When I buy a book I have to finish it but I read 3 other books in between trying to finish this book.  Unfortunately I bought the 3 of them so it will be taking me a very long time to get to the second and third books.
B00322PK2G|5.0|Purchased for my 91 yr old Mom so she had a stylish watch she could read the numbers!  She's Thrilled!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I was curious about this book seriesand all the hype surrounding the movie. I purchased The Hunger Games and was pleasantly surpried and quite impressed with it.<br />It was interesting and easy to read. I was glad I read all three books in this series before I watched the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a great read!!! Once you start reading it and getting to know the characters you can't put it down. It's more than just a sex....it was a great story that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|iT WAS ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE, JUST NEEDED A LITTLE MORE \\"SHERLOCK\\" GOING ON!! tHE FIRST KEPT YOU MORE ON TRACK I THINK, THIS ONE KIND OF LEFT A PERSON GUESSING WHAT WAS COMING NEXT.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Absolutely love this app! It works amazing on my kindle fire! I've been waiting so long for it to come out on here
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I was looking forward to read this book, I like erotica stories and this style especially, but I definitely know better books. some phrases are repeated through all book and in some parties very often. Some part are really good, but the language is not good. The story has a good foundation, but the author could make it better. In some part, the story looks like romantic imaginations about D/s life, but the vanilla parts are vell written.<br />This is not a bad book, but you should expect breathtaking story about girl without experiences in rough life...
B006ATJXQW|2.0|I couldn't wait for the Kill Order to be released. That being said, I found it to be a huge disappointment. The main character, Mark, was weak and under developed. I loved the Maze Runner Trilogy and recommended it to my book club. Unfortunately, I didn't like this story or the ending. I had hoped for a little more background on Thomas too. Sorry, but I don't recommend this book. Waste of money.
B002OOG6RQ|3.0|I bought this album long time ago, but i forgot about my review.<br />Musically is nothing new, is the same sound as we know it.<br />The opening song ''Rammlied' is just another version of a song that i heard it on their debut album. ''ich tu dir weh' is saved by the chorus , which is really good, but the song itself is running out of...creativity. The third song ''waidmanns heil'' is the song that saves the album so far. Very aggressive . ''Haifisch'' reminds me of Depeche Mode and im talking about the synths. The one called simply ''B....'' is another great song , full of Till's screams and very heavy guitars. The ballad Fruhling in Paris is just a song and basically after this song is really nothing to say. The commercial sound of P...y a combination of metal and techno with a pornographic video was actually the first message about the album.<br />It's an album made by a great band,but is just an album. Very weak compared to their old ones and is really running of creativity and i think i need some different sounds from them.
B007ELN8Y8|4.0|I missed seeing the movie when it was released so rented it through Amazon Prime.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and the dog was precious.  It was a good story about a starlet falling in love with an older man who was a matinee idol in the silent movies, but failed to find success in the \\"talkies.\\"  She became a major star but never forgot the kindness he showed her when she was just beginning.  He would not accept her help when he lost all his possessions in an auction, because he was too proud.  Eventually, he accepted her love, found she had purchased all his possessions, formed a tap dance team, and apparently lived happily ever after.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I never thought one of my top 5 personal favorite movies of all time would involve romance and love.  Just to get an idea, three other movies that made my top 5 is \\"saving private ryan\\", \\"independence day\\", and \\"swingers\\".  Well, after my wife had me watch it with her, i watched it two more times and loved it.  It's witty, original and realistic.
0345522303|2.0|First, a suggestion to the author - Include a list of character names and descriptions of who they are in the back of the book. That would be really helpful for those of us who have not read the series in several years.<br /><br />At no point did I actually feel drawn into the story. I know what the story is about; political intrigue, a war, a hot summer and a strange plague. I know who ALL the main characters are. Do I care? No, not really. I didn't see much point in the political intrigue part. The conspirators didn't accomplish anything or even cause that much trouble. I think the plague could have been more sinister and more interesting if a little more effort had been put into it but everything is just way to obvious to the reader while the characters seem way too oblivious.<br /><br />Overall, the whole book left me feeling ... meh.
0525953728|1.0|Shame on him.  Shame on the publisher.  Shame on anyone who purchases this \\"book\\".  I fear that the concept of honor has been lost forever if things like this are published.  Certainly glad the mission was successfully accomplished.  Certainly disappointed to read the details, for it will only put the next SEAL team in that much more danger.  Surely they deserve better than this.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I bought a 17.5 inch Toshiba so most laptop backpacks simply aren't big enough. This one works. I've already shlepped through several airports with this and all my gear and was able to do so with ease. It has lots of compartments to sort and stash gear so you can find it when you need it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|My husband purchased this clock/alarm for my bedside table because the dual unit which we had on his bedside table was too much trouble to reach when I wanted to snooze and was hard to see when he was still in bed. The unit works as described and I like the fact that it doesn't have to be set which is sometimes an imperfect process. I'm happy with the purchase.
B004ZNACA6|4.0|I'm a huge PF fan and this is a great collection at a very fair price. 5 Stars on the content!<br /><br />With that being said, I'm disappointed in two things. First, I'm a bit bummed that the Box that contains the CD's wasn't better thought out. I'm fairly certain that the packaging was designed by stoners with the intent of playing a joke on other stoners. Dude, slide over and help me open the Floyd!<br /><br />Second, the Box Set was poorly packaged for shipment. It was placed in a shipping carton which was at least three times the size on the Box Set and there was only one small piece of packing material. This left the box set free to bounce around inside the shipping carton while in transit which resulted in severely mashing three corners of the box set. The CD's and literature were fine so I'm going to keep the order, but for $150 it would have been nice to receive the order in better physical condition.<br /><br />1 Star for the box design and damaged content as a result or poor shipping materials.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|simple, relaxing, Zen-inducing puzzler.  It starts slow but eventually builds to some pretty nifty, brain bending heights.  all the while soothing your troubled brain with soft muzak.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews on here but it was needless.  Put it on my Fire about a week ago.....have spent even more time on it than ever!  Does occasionally take a little longer to open and I have had to force close a few times but I have problems with some sites on my computor when it's  prime time.  Don't  let the bad reviews scare you.
B0031RS42K|4.0|Different from his other writes - a good read.<br />Easy to follow story line and characters involved.<br />Looking forward to something similar from author.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Not very interesting. Needs more charater development to get me interested in the book. The plot reminds me of twilght, and more boring.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|No question one of the best classic movies of all time. Steve McQueen at his best, just about as good as \\"The Great Escape\\". This movie has the best automobile chase scene of all times using the coolest car Ford ever made..<br /><br />Wonderful entertainment,<br /><br />LUCKSTER
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book catches you from the beginning, and keeps you wanting more! I'm halfway through the 2nd book and can't wait until the 3rd!!!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|another movie worthy of Liam. great thrill ride with even better twist at the end. i can relate to the plight of the characters.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Dont care how old you are.  You will love this movie.  Was a sceptic when all the commercial hype came out when it hit the<br />theatre.  By daughter convinced me to watch and now I'm a fan.  Its an extra treat in 3D.
B006B7LQ90|5.0|A must-read book for all marketer, it's not only a valuable mindset worth adopting when you design a marketing campaign, but also a thought for designing your own career.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Season 4 was very entertaining...made me very excited for season 5. Can't wait to see how it all works out. Well written and a great cast.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is the best 4 batteries!! it can give every thing. you need to know for your lifespan of your battery and what you can do and not do.
B0063B2BGG|5.0|Great quality & ease of use. Highly recommended! Had a billing error (my fault) and customer service was Awesome. I'll be ordering more Video on Demand.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is excellent, it picks up right where the first one left off. I'm already half way done with book 3. The whole series has been very well written.
B004SF30HI|5.0|This music is great, we all love it and have dance parties.  The kids and adults love the music, can't go wrong with THAT!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Wow. I paid for this app months ago, and now its FAOTD. It is an awesome game, but I'm so annoyed it is free now. I LOVE THJS GAME THOUGH IT IS EPIC ...
B007TMON8M|5.0|I got easily frustrated building wooden bridges, so I am glad to see new challenges with a game like this.  Seems to have more realistic implications with trying to build strength against wind in buildings and the likes.  This game actually make more sense to me than building bridges, so great job putting this out and I can't wait to be the best engineer in no time...haha :D
B006OCM0G0|1.0|teamlava games are a money pit. they have &quot;traps&quot; that will cost you all your hard earned gems. no safeguards on this game. no customer service at all. I spent 5 frustrating weeks trying to get my inventory list from where I was directed by teamlava. only got computer generated answer to wrong question then finally an email that this info wasn't available . major money pit.stay away
B005USZYDU|3.0|This was an ok story--I liked the Theodore Boone character, but the ending was so abrupt, it spoiled the whole thing for me.
B000HF6XPY|4.0|Very good classic remind me whent I was a kids.  I like this movie I don't get tired seen this movie
B001NLKT60|5.0|it keeps you wanting more. it is hard to put down. author has done a good job with this second book in the series looking forward to book 3.
B006LSZECO|4.0|....literally.  I can't read it without my heart rate going up and my stomach clenching.  A quick and gripping read!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you like fantasy/adventure stories a la LOTR than tiis is the book series 4 You! Plus the kindle version is very interactive and keeps track of what you have read!
B004H3WWU2|5.0|Pros<br />- Uber stylish<br />- Lots of pockets and places to put stuff<br />- Pockets on the shoulder straps for phones, iPods, etc<br />- Comfortable<br /><br />Cons<br />- It is a slim bag so it's not going to hold a ton of bulky stuff. If you carry a lot of electronics, chargers, camera, etc then this may not be the best bag.<br />- It can't stand up on it's own. I didn't think this would be a big deal at first (I saw it mentioned in a review) but having my bag flop around all over the place at work and class is REALLY annoying.<br /><br />With that said, I LOVE this bag. Pros far outweigh the cons.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I ordered this to watch on my kindle while traveling. Even on the sm screen it was great! I also loved that my husband could also watch it at home.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl is certainly a page-turner and is well-constructed (the author left no loose ends despite unique plot twists).  The story, however, is not one that stays with the reader for days or weeks after the last page is read. Another recent \\"murder mystery,\\" Defending Jacob, was much more memorable and thought-provoking, probably because the characters were considerably more likeable and the reader could connect with the emotions.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great read!  This is a rare case of the sequel actually fulfilling the high expectations one is left with after the first of the series.  The ending is a cliff-hanger of note though, so be warned.  This is going to make a great movie.
B007SSEBCU|5.0|Meryl Streep was phenomenal.<br />Her portrayal as the old woman looking back on her long career was so perfect and so realistic.<br />I especially liked her early romnantic years with her young husband.<br />The movie did not idealize her but told the truth about her neglect of her husband and children once she entered politics.<br /><br />Her acting as the old woman, her walk, her face, her interactions with her husband no one else could see were lovely.  I cried when he finally disappeared in light.<br /><br />The whole movie was very satisfyiing for me.  I would recommend it highly to anyone.
B004KKX80A|5.0|it was so awsome a got for my son's birthday.he was so happy when he got it he was scremin BIG BANG PEGISUS BIG BANG PEGISUS!<br />get i rocomed it!
B0070R40V6|4.0|The book Is Just right for its price; nothing mor&eacute; nothing less. I think its made pretty well, it doesnt semestre to bebe vera resitant, but it Is not aun expansiva product!
0525953728|5.0|I got this book yesterday and read it through cover to cover in about 8 hours. As a retired US Navy CPO, and having had security clearances; there is nothing in this book that would be considered as classified. DoD may argue some of the diagrams by the author of how events actually happened from his prospective as Team leader, but I dont believe that would  win in a court fight.<br />Clearly the Author expresses his belief that Civilian Government officials revealed more, and highly inaccurate information vice what he encountered on the Ground.<br /> I retired in 1983 and based on what was common knowledge both within DOD and from my further readings from civilian sources since 1983 anyone with a modicum of intelligence could or would know the information on Seal operations,training and capabilities.<br />Note he does not reveal anything about the special chopper used on the missions! Or identities of actual persons other that those previously revealed by the Govenrment and media outlets<br />Clearly because of his criticism of U.S. Officials and willingness to tell it like it happend causes some political embarassment to DOD and Elected officials. Everything that was highly classified was leaked by the Government in News flashes and media. Everyone including senior Military Leaders jumped on the information band wagon to show their knowledge etc.<br />Clearly the Author has indicated that his disallusionment with all the leaks and total inacuracies led to his effort to correct the record.<br />This is an excellent read that clearly tells an important story in our History as a country, and the accomplishments of our Military.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is one of ny favorite games. it is so addicting and easy to play with good graphics. a great game I recommend playing! awesome job dev.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it is an awesome product!! it was a great transaction!! it was a very quick and easy to download. i am ver satisfied
0345529057|5.0|An incredible, improbable, impossible, wildly imaginative work of fiction! Despite its faults it is so creative, so intricately woven with surprise plot twists that leave one shaking one's head in admiration for the author's creativity.<br />A must-read.<br /><br />David Levine, D.O., published poet and author of \\"Toubab: An American Doctor in West Africa\\".
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was very intense and enjoyable to watch.  Watched it with family and all enjoyed it. Kept everyone interesting in watching it from start to finish without any breaks.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|I watched this movie with 2 good girl friends of mine.  We honestly couldn't stop giggling throughout (some of it nervous, some just because and some, well, the dancing says it all). The opening part of the movie was probably the cheesiest; with the bus ride full of common folk and a chipmunk sounding, country girl crooning \\"Sister Christian\\". The movie abounds with 80's music. All you can pretty much sing along with because of the popularity of them.  Who doesn't know Foreigner, Journey, REO Speedwagon songs?<br />You've really got to watch it if you love 80's music.  There are some parts that a teen under 16 (IMO) shouldn't watch.  Not much flesh shown, but insinuations out of the wa-zoo. Could have done without a few other choice scenes (one involving Brand and Baldwin and the other with Cruise and Akerman).  Towards the end of the movie, the late 80's song scene throw-in was hil-a-ri-ous!!<br />Can't say I didn't enjoy the movie.  That's why I give it 4 stars.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Haven't finished it yet but it is just as good as the first two books in the series so far!!!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was my first Crouch book and I really enjoyed reading \\"Pines\\". I will definitely read other books by this author. My only disappointment was that it didn't continue a bit longer.
B000RJO578|5.0|Good parody of a cop movie. Had both my wife and I laughing at the references to other cop movies, funny one liners and over the top schtick.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Enjoyed reading about what goes on from the perspective of someone who was in the war; what he went through.  Very interesting since I had no idea.  I truly appreciate what he has done, and others like him, for our country.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is an engrossing and creative series, with unique characters that come alive for the reader and a rich dystopia that is pleasingly complex while avoiding that permeating, joyless bleakness that makes some books of this genre exhausting to read (i.e. Flowertown, which is good but just so grim to be immersed in).<br /><br />At the beginning, it feels to me like the prose is a little rough in a couple of places, or maybe like our author is trying a bit too hard. If you find this to be the case, stick with it. Mister Howey's writing evens out fairly early on, and much like George RR Martin, he soon develops a spare elegance to his writing that allows his brilliant world-building and gratifying characterization to flourish.<br /><br />(no spoilers coming--I promise)<br /><br />As I neared the conclusion of Wool 5, I found myself worrying that I would be dissatisfied with the ending.  It's so difficult to take the reader on a journey such as this and then end well. Luckily, our Mister Howey has a poet's sense of endings, and finishes each installment of Wool with just the right blend of resolution and ambiguity.<br /><br />I will eagerly await new work by Hugh Howey, whether he continues the Wool series or moves on to other projects!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It's not \\"hi literature\\" but a very interesting phenomenon for woman with an active sexual life and a good  reminder for man that seduction is everything.<br />Buy it and read it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|THIS IS A BIBLE TO GO.THIS MEAN'S ANY WHERE I GO WITH MY IPHONE, I HAVE A BIBLE.THIS IS COOL.
0525953728|5.0|D.C. is full of it if they say this guy talked out of school or talked negatively about the President.  He told the story as it played out.  Many props to this operator and those who served!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|*************may contain spoilers**************<br />I'm honestly not sure how I feel about this conclusion to the trilogy.  It's subtle, yet strong; clever, yet simple.  I love this book, I'm just not sure I like the way it ends...
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I went ahead and got the paid version after trying the free one. The story line on the quest is pretty juvenile but the game itself on all levels is beautiful and interesting. In the classic mode you can choose your tile design and background. I wish the music would change too. I have this game on my Kindle Fire which makes the tiles a decent size. Can't imagine it on a phone!
B007RFBLDG|2.0|This movie was so stupid I kept waiting for it to get to a good part but it never did!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Reading it as an adult is definitely a totally different experience then reading it as a young child.  It is almost like reading a totally new, yet still quite awesome edition.
0307730697|5.0|When my folks watched a TV interview of Adam Brown's family, they had not heard of Eric Blehm.  Now they own all of his books.  He came highly recommended to me and when I visited my parents, they handed me the book, Fearless.  And it took me only 2 late nights to finish it; I couldn't put it down!  Thank you Eric Blehm for telling it like it is and bravely sharing the life of one Navy Seal.  Adam Brown is a hero.  Read the book...you won't be able to put it down!  And then you'll want to read the rest of Eric Blehm's books...keep writing Eric!  ~ an avid Blehm Book addict...and a G. I. Jane!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I started reading the first book in the trilogy just to see what all the hype was about. I was hooked in no time and read thru all 3 books in about a week. I've already started reading them a second time!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I've always loved both of these stars but Meryl outdid herself this time. She BECAME Julia Child. The voice, the cadence, and mannerisms are absolutely perfect.
B00846TTDG|3.0|The movie was entertaining, but I did not like how they used \\"real navy seals\\" to make a unrealistic war movie that reminds you more of call of duty than \\"Apocalypse now\\". The ending was a slap in the face, and the script was predictable at best. Everyone I know loved it, and you might like it as well, but I would like to point out that if you care about realism, you may not like the inconsistencies.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Brad Pitt's incredibly funny performance and Melanie Laurent's terrific portrayal and beauty combined with a fantastic script make this one of the best films ever made. Highly recommended!!!
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|An example of why Disney needs Pixar. The movie was boring, and seemed to drag on forever. The plot was odd yet predictable. I disliked this movie from start to finish.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was wondering what all the hype was about. WOW!!!!! Very sexy.  After reading the first book I couldn't wait to get to this one.  I was not disappointed and I am enjoying the third book as well.  Thank you E.L. James
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great first entry of this trilogy and pretty good adaptation of the book.  Can't wait for the remaining 2 movies!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This is the second copy of this movie I have bought.  <3 it.....  I watch this at least once a week...  I sing the music all the time...
055358202X|1.0|Who said in the mystical distant land, they don't have All My Children & General Hospital series? I have had a feeling that the stories keep going on & on after reading book 2 and yes, book 3 has indeed confirmed my nagging feeling. But I tried to finish it to see if there is any closure on Book 4. Well, about 100 pages into book 4, I have to put down to search in internet to see if King Martin has some plans for other books. Yep, he did plan to have book 7. For now.<br /><br />Book 4 is a totally waste of time leading to another waste of time and then to another waste of time, to infinity if King Martin's health permits. The series should close around book 3 and at worse book 4. But King Martin keeps go on & on with his very \\"inventive\\" & petty plots and many plots really do insult reader intelligence. But I have to tip my hat as King Martin is the best in milking cows by stuffing his books with junks. See you at book 100.
B005QVCXM6|5.0|Packed full of good songs! The price was amazing! Love the mp3 so easy to take on the road. Swimming home is my fav!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is pure delight.  Exciting, compelling and surprising.<br /><br />I am a little past the middle and going strong.<br /><br />You need to read this.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am still reading it, but I can say it really keeps the pace with the previous titles. The narrative takes place at the same time frame as A Feast For Crows, only focusing on different characters. If you have read the other four books, you must pick this one as well.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book, read it in a matter of hours. Really enjoyed the characters and cannot wait for the third book in this series to come out!
B003PM5Y4M|1.0|The product itself was great and I would order more movies from this seller again.  As far as the movie itself, I wasted the 1.00 for the movie and the 2.98 in shipping.  I cant undo the star I put as a rating,  I wish I could put minus stars.  For the seller, I would put 5 stars, the movie, not so much.  I think If I had the choice between this movie and 2 hours of Barney, I would take Barney.  The only redeeming quality in this movie is Robert Downey Jr. and how he played a black guy, that was pretty funny. And the one scene where Less whats his name (Tom Cruises roll) when he made the key grip punch the director in the face, \\"really f'ing hard\\".<br />But, yeah... even if its free, it wasn't worth it.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I'm always looking for 'problem-solving' type games/exercises and this definitely fills that order.  They start out easy and progressively get more difficult.  Collecting the pearls in the fewest number of moves (in upper left in () will be the fewest moves possible) can be challenging enough and then as you get into more levels they have hazards to avoid = great game.  I play this on my Kindle Fire with no problems.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|Great flick, very entertaining and an interesting take on the classic tale.  Im guessing there will be a sequel if they made enough money off of this one that is.<br /><br />The back story here is much better than say, Lucas's lame attempt at the Star Wars series back story.
0062213423|5.0|My 13-year-old was absorbed in this book for two or three days. She read it cover to cover and seemed thrilled with all the info about her favorite group. I know she would recommend it!
030758836X|1.0|Remarkably superficial, characters never go beyond one dimensional stereotypes, arguably sexist and ultimately disappointing across the board. Like eating late night junk food, mildly enjoyable at first but you quickly come to regret that you did it and it seems more and more foolish the more you think about it.
B008A1NSTG|3.0|This was an enjoyable, if not memorable picture. The performances<br />were generally adequate, but forgettable. The story of the whales<br />and their sad predicament was what captured and held my attention.<br />The unfolding, or was it refolding, of the love story, and the boy<br />and his different generation grandfather, were pretty hackneyed and<br />unoriginal. So, an \\"OK\\", one-shot film.
0062124293|5.0|I love the book -- and it's going on my daughters' Compulsory Reading List -- but I love Moran even more. What a woman! She's a good 15+ years younger than I, so every time she started veering in a direction that made me think, \\"OK, here goes. This is where we diverge. She was born too late to GET IT\\"...she GETS IT. And not only does she totally Get It, she expresses it colorfully and right Out There. She even manages to used the Hebrew word *eruv* and get its meaning right, and she doesn't appear to have a Jewish background. But it's not just that I happen to agree with Moran on every topic herein; she's refreshing, and a feminist...and younger than I! And that's rare. I want to be this woman's friend. What I wouldn't give just to meet her for coffee!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was easy reading and had enough twists and turns to keep me interested.  As I read this I kept seeing it in my head as a movie - I don't know if there are plans for a movie, but it would be entertaining.  I also liked how the chapters alternated between Nick and Amy.  Light and entertaining - nothing heavy at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it. so fun! I love using it at night when going to sleep. it cures my boredom. works perfect!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|a fun and challenging game. the only reason that I cant give it 5 stars is that there is no challenge before resetting your progress.  I was making great progress until my 3 year old cleared my data.  Arrrgh!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it so much fun everyone should play this its so awesome.  my kids love it as well. they play it as much as I do. lol
034580404X|4.0|I'm an avid pencil enthusiast, I use them to draw, write, color, underline, etc. I even use them for tasks beyond their scope of purpose (don't ask). I always used to prefer the bold colors (they truly brighten up every writing and/or drawing)  but lately I started to appreciate the muted colors more; the Greys. So I've been searching for a long time to get my hands on some Grey colored pencils to no avail. Then suddenly, I stumbled upon this product; 50 shades of Grey. I couldn't believe my eyes. 50 pencils with a different color of Grey, packed in a beautiful box with a picture of a tie (although I never heard of a pencil manufacturer named  E L James, I just assumed it was some fancy European brand). I was happier than a little kid on Christmas morning. Of course, I ordered the product immediately, even paid extra for expedited shipping. You can imagine how disappointed I was when the shipment arrived. No pencils, just a book. Since I always try to see things from the bright side my disappointment changed to curiosity relatively fast. Maybe this book is about the author's experience with 50 different ,Grey colored, pencils, how it  changed his life and I can still enjoy all those Greys through the authors eyes.  Turns out the book has nothing to do at  all with pencils. It's some lady porn about a college student named Anastasia. The book is well written and have to admit quite exciting. I give it four out of five stars
B002QW7ALM|4.0|Wow, I really liked this movie.  I had no idea what it was going to be about and the first time I watched it I was very surprised.  It's dark and awful at times (but in a good way), and the plot twists and turns and keeps you guessing.  The cast does a great job and I found that I was biting my nails up until the very end.  Take a chance on this one!
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Funny and yet very insightful of our human nature . Everyone has issues in their life, learning to handle them is what life is all about.  Enjoyed it .
B003UBTX72|5.0|outlaw stuff,as weird as life gets.......loser who is crippled by life who turns it back on his passion only to win big time
B007Q476KU|2.0|We were disappointed in this movie.  Although it was beautifully filmed, it was corny and tedious to watch.  I do not recommend it.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|It was a book I realy enjoy reading, to see the everything from a 5 years old boy view--a boy there never have seen the \\"the outside\\" was a amazing read ... Thanks.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat.  Each chapter had me guessing what could have happened, but by the next chapter my ideas and thoughts had changed.  Great read....couldn't put it down!
B007LB2B3K|5.0|I love it. Lots of range, its sort of all over not at all what I thought it would be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this game its awsome my children love it too its a time killing machine with over 100 games that range fron easy to hard.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|on kindle fire it keep crashing without even getting to main menu  if you worked that out it would be nice but i gotta say 1 star
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book puts into perspective some of what our special forces do to prepare for our defense and protection. A good read. A must read.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Like the two before it, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and was eager to see how it ends.  I noticed whilst reading it i kept guessing how it was going to end and though satisfied once i finished the book, i found i was left wanting.  Regardless, if you've read the two before it, this is a must read.  For people wanting a good easy to read trilogy, this is it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game... its old school frkm the gsmes on the old computers but a classic! wish some would come up with skip-bo!
B008602KQI|5.0|Simple in many respects, but many a great concept is \\"simple.\\" Tells the tale of a girl caught up in a cruel means of punishment for her forebears audacity in having rebelled against a tyrannical central government and lost the war. Does this sound vaguely prophetic?<br /><br />Well done, interesting. Cannot wait for the sequels to this film.[[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games [2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy]]]
B0057MFA42|1.0|I was excited to see that Geffen finally released this but noticed that the bluray version has some very noticeable sync issues. During \\"Drain You\\" you can clearly tell that Kurt's strumming motion and Dave's drums don't match at all! What's worse is when they zoom in on Dave and the drum hits are WAY off from the audio. Do yourself a favor and buy the DVD, most bluray players do a pretty good job of upscaling anyway.
B000FA6720|5.0|Wonderful story, and easy to read. It has a lot more detail than the movie and you realize the movie followed the book closely.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved this incredibly written and moving story! There are so many sad but beautifully told events.  I loved the characters all around. Please read this important story.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Like the first book, i thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  A bit slow to start but a great finish and couldn't help but start the third book straight away.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had been playing Temple Run on my smart phone for a while and had decided to see if it was available for my Kindle Fire.  When I saw it was I had to get it.  It is a bit more challanging on a device that is bigger than a smart phone but just as fun and just as addicting!
B0088TG252|5.0|Any movie with Denzel is sure to be a winner but my man Denzel took this to a whole other level. This movie will not disappoint it has romance action suspense and when you think you know whats going to happen next you don't and that's the best part. Loved it!
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it first came out.  I had never heard of the books, just heard so many great reviews so I thought I'd better go see what everyone was raving about.  I was very impressed, and waited impatiently for the dvd's release date.  I received it several days ago, and now can't wait for movie number 2...and then, by the way, I purchased the 3 books from amazon for my kindle.  Now I'm ready for everything !!
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I've seen the film Psycho many times oveer the years and now I've purchased the Blue Ray version to watch with my teenager. Even though it is an older film it still holds the Hitchcock suspense and fear for the next generation of viewers.
B0049NMMJQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, though I don't watch it that often.  This movie really stands the test of time.  While it may not be as terrifying compared to the horror movies of today, which are so heavily supported by CGI, it seems so much more believable because of it's simplicity.  I can't say I could identify the specific added footage, but none of the scenes seemed to be wasted film or time.  Still a classic.
B006NXIDMU|5.0|I bought this book after watching the movie and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  As a result, i bought the other books too, Catching Fire and Mockingjay.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|sdf<br />this game remindss me of school only much better graphics of course.  I use up too much energy way too quick though
B007X15GRQ|2.0|I am one of those people who feel like Mark Whalberg made a great transition from raping/modeling and has become one of the most entertaining actors we have to date however; this movie was horrible at least for me. This movie was predictable, slow, boring i just saw this whole scene before and i am so glad i did not pay to see this in the movie theater as a person who hate's going to the dentist i would rather be in the dentist chair than to sit through this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book I could not put down. So many turns and surprises I had no idea what was next. Really a fast read. Crazy marriage and crazy characters , really quite shocking.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I used to love this game. Then I started finding the AI frustrating and inexplicable. Now I think I've come to a better understanding and I like the game again. I put the game away for a long time, but I've returned so that I can finish it and move on to the sequel.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Movie is great, its based on a true story. Shows how much our military does to help others as while keeping our country safe. definitely recommend buying this movie..
B004TI5N38|5.0|Zero Day by D B  is one on his better accomplishments.  Enjoyed the suspence and intrigue, I could not put aside because I had to follow thru what his characters were doing
B008XG1X18|1.0|Had trouble getting registered and getting email/password to be accepted. After seeing pictures posted by others I decided it was not worth the hastle.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I am not a Twillight follower my daughter is the one into the books and stuff i have watched them with her but i always fall to sleep. This one was different for me you never saw the story of a vampire impregnating a human it's never been done and to see the story unfold it just left me wanting more so i guess it's official i am official'y a twillight fan.
B008XG1X18|4.0|overall I really enjoy it. although it had caused my kindle fire to freeze up twice now. eh. I definitely recommend it.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I loved the movie John Carter and would love Disney to make a sequel to the movie.The reason why John Carter didnt do better was because of the poor name of the movie and the marketing for the movie really was horrible.Anybody that wants to try to get a sequel to John Carter made their is a facebook group called BacktoBarsoom thats trying to make it happen by gathering support for a John Carter sequel to be made.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I love the Outlander series of books! I was hooked when I started reading Outlander.  Claire and Jamie are such a passionate couple. Any book about Scotland or Ireland will attract my attention but the Outlander series not only attracted but had me hooked immediately. I am now reading Drums of Autumn and still can't wait to pick up my kindle and read more about their love story!
0143038095|5.0|This was the first book of Tan's I ever read, and it made me a fan forever after. It's a brilliant collection of interwoven stories, with a wonderful, economic, and elegant prose, that often says so much with so little (similar to some of Hermann Hesse's finest work). This has been one of my favorite books for many years and has a beautiful resonance that shines down through the years, revealing much about relationships and the distance that cultures create between those even in the same family. Heartfelt, wise, insightful, touching... there aren't enough lovely adjectives to describe it.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I'm going to keep this short.  This is the first Neil Gaiman book I've read because I apparently am a shame to the rest of the geek and nerd community.  If Gaiman made a distinct choice to make his main character very vague and blas&eacute; about everything so that the reader is sucked along, ignoring glaring alarms that something is not right, then excellent job there!  If you have a hard time with suspension of disbelief, this will be very difficult to push through.<br />Overall, liked the story, felt a little rushed.  Since I read Stardust after finishing this, I am realizing that this is common to his writing style.  He focuses a lot on the action and ignores characterization in the books I've read.<br />I find the book enjoyable and a good read.  That being said, with how much hype there is about Neil Gaiman in my geeky community, I was underwhelmed.
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I did not see any advertisements of this movie in the cinema's so when i was going through the Amazon catalog and saw the preview it peaked my interest. This movie had some great action scene's going for it and it had some good suspense moments going on i would recommend this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I wanted to find out what really happened. Gyllian Flynn is really knowledgable about human psychology! She has great insight into marriage. Really good read!
1439102430|3.0|having read all of Reichs books I must say she has fallen into the trap of formula writing.  You know early on she is going to have a dream that leaves her wondering how everything fits together, you also know near the end she will get caught by the bad guys and that one of her male \\"partners/lovers\\" will rescue her.  This one also had too many characters in and out of the story so by the time you find out who is the villain you have to stop and think now who was this guy.
B00866H7SS|3.0|Bared To You is a good book if you just want to read a story without giving it much thought. It is entertaining and you do get involved in there lives and want to know what happens next.<br /> But if you think about it too much you see a few holes in the story. It never really explains why she loves Gideon so much. All she talks about is his money and his looks. But then proclaims that these aren't at all important. So why does she love him?  Hopefully all will be answered in the next book! I am looking forward to see what happens to them in the future.
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie was really close to the book there were a few things missing, but the movie can stand on it's own.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book for any age. Well written and terrific plot line. Happy Reading and May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favor!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I am not one of those people who read the book so i did not know what to expect and what was worse was the look of the movie in the beginning but when i gave the move a good 10 min to talk to me i was on the edge of my seat the entire time i loved it and i hope you enjoy it as much as i did.
B00684J49U|5.0|My sister got me into this show during season 1 and been fan of it all 8 years but this past season wasnt all that great really the best one of season 8 was the Plane Crash.I just order this to Add to my Collection Of Grey's anatomy dvd i have all of them when the item arrives
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Well seasoned individual found the books geared toward juvenile audience entertaining and worth the time. Hopefully, the movie sequel will be as engaging as the initial movie.  Three generations viewed and enjoyed the movie together.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this game daily &amp; I love it.  Love it when I win &amp; it auto completes.  I have not had any problems with it on my Kindle Fire.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Loved it, signed up for next book as well, would recommend. A great read that is hard to put down.
B006YMLCYG|5.0|barney experiences that feeling of falling in love, being sure, and then that single moment where all the surety stops time itslef, and that feeling of failure seems to last forever.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Of course, our men and women of the military are the heroes in this story.<br />But, the insight into what goes into training and selection of the elite SEALs was terrific.<br />I literally could not put this book down and when it was finished, I wanted more.<br />My heart and gratitude go out to these amazing people who protect our way of life.
B002LVUKIS|5.0|If you've never played the Thief series, I can't even begin to tell you what you're missing.  This is one of the best written and executed collection of games there ever was.  These games rely on stealth and sneaking instead of hardened combat.  The voice acting is great, and the stories are very engaging.  The first game's \\"Haunted Cathedral\\" is one of the creepiest levels that I have ever played in a game, and the level design of the 2nd game is second to none.<br /><br />Having all 3 games together in one package is pure joy.  All of the patches are already installed automatically, and it comes with Thief Gold which has extra levels not originally included in the original release.  I've played all of them on Win 7 with no problems.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor - get it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|didn't care for all the killing of children but the story was ok....bizarre....should have stuck more with the books.  most of the actors did good job
B0081L37Z0|5.0|Very funny make sure kids are not around. I laughed through the whole movie. If you liked superbad you will love this movie
B0091XRL86|3.0|Very difficult to understand accents particularly in the beginning of the movie. A little advanced linguistically for a 5 year old. However, visually very good.
B005WQ34X2|5.0|paying homage to the slapstick humor of yesteryear, Robin & Barney set out to unvover the devious, deal-breaking secrets of Ted's new conquest!!
0634049011|4.0|Page 8 and 9 alone justify the price of the book.  Get through to page 30 or so and you've learned a helluva lot.  The first 6 chapters go quickly and you'll be tickled at your progress, assuming you knew nothing about the fretboard before.  At chapter 7 things begin to slow down as you apply the things you've already learned into unlocking the more complex challenge of figuring out major scale patterns across all six strings from one position.  Before this you had only done it along one string....easy-peasy.  From here on out you've got to have your thinking cap on .......and you're only on page 23.  But the thing is you've already learned a lot by page 23.  Certainly worth what you paid and you have a lot more meat on the bone (like 2/3's more of the book).  There are chapters like chapter 7 that might only be 3 pages long but will take a long time to figure out AND get under your fingers.  I think an argument for hybrid learning can be inserted here, because my feeling is that some sections of the workbook might stop the less-persisent in their tracks.  Trying to figure out those major scale patterns and patching them together up and down the fretboard could be one of those sections.  That ones a biggy.  Some Youtube videos might grease the learning wheels a bit, but that's just my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, the Fretboard Workbook is a really valuable book.  It helped me a lot and I recommend it without reservation.  I'd also recommend some good Youtube videos ( justinguitars dot com for example - and no, I've got no agenda in propping that guy).<br /><br />Regards
B00066VMC8|4.0|Really enjoy watching this music video! The grainy shots is a little different but the music is great! Lots of good shots of Meg and Jack and the performance is roaring with energy! Fun to watch!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Absolutely awesome book!!! I love the story and how detailed. I'm ready to read it again!! Hope there will be more books to come.
B00005N6KG|1.0|The title says it all!! I believe that you should consider buying these headphones only if  you have abnormal ears or you are an alien!  They don't stay on in place even for a minute!  I use these while running on treadmill, and they just won't stay on!!  The sound quality is great, no complaints at that end, however the design is the worst, that i've ever seen! I have never owned such uncomfortable headphones ever in my life! In my opinion, AMAZON should stop selling these or issue a full refund of the product!<br /><br />The product did arrive in a timely manner and properly packed, but I can't stand it!!  I waited for sometime to write a review, today, I couldn't stand using them.  Sony should reconsider designing such pathetic items and pull them off the market!!  In brief, save your money and don't even look into buying this, its a cheap product and deserves negative rating!!
B0088TG252|3.0|I like Denzel Washington but not in the role as he had in Safe House.  I do not really care for a movie like this but when it has Denzel in it I have to watch.  The movie was alright but I have seen better.
B0038P59A0|5.0|The movie is awesome, of course. I didn't have any issues with my purchase or the quality of the movie.
B0081KTI0E|3.0|Eh, it wasn't bad or good, it was eh.I would give it a three. The ending was good, not predictable like you'd think.
B008XG1X18|4.0|if it didn't crash all the time. Server is always busy or &quot;having trouble&quot;. So annoying because you have to close it and then try to find whatever it was you were looking at before it crashed.
1594135851|4.0|One of the best book trilogies I have read in a long time:-). I also bought all three books and sent them to my son for a birthday gift and he also loved this set.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I wasn't sure about this game at first. But am seriously addicted now. I have introduced it to all my family and everyone loves it! It is definetly a brain puzzle game!
B005P5TQPU|4.0|I love Supernatural. I always have. The cast and crew are amazing and the storylines are unbeatable. I do have to admit that season 7 was a bit disappointing. Still very enjoyable though.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is awesome to reinforce good problem solving skills! We recommend it for people of all ages. 2 thumbs up!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I find this to be a very useful free app that I frequent several times a day. Would recommend to others, it's a good way to know when recharging your fire is going to be necessary.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|Not Wahlberg's best movie but certainly worth renting.  It does relive the movie heist genre, and there are a couple of scenes that are over the top but knowing that it's still worth renting...
B008602KQI|4.0|Not what I expected at all, after all the hype I was waiting for more..but out was ok I guess..
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Got this game to kill some time while waiting for appointments. and it's. great. love it. it will keep me entertained for awhile and I can share it with my clients I escorted.
B00633W614|5.0|TAny of Jeffrey Archer's books keep me riveted.  I read every one from Kane and Abel to the present. I just enjoy his style of writing and the flow of his books.  They keep me very interested.
B008BM9L72|3.0|To be honest if you just want to read about sex this is the book for you, found it to be a bit too perfect with him being rich and handsome and her being beautiful and a virgin. Don't think I would fancy being controlled  the way he controlled her
B00846REIS|5.0|If all books were like this I would be an avid reader lol . Wasn't sure what to expect after reading the 50 shades trilogy , but I found this book to be a page turner , especially with those juicy intimate moments ;-).. thoroughly enjoyed the book . Can't wait for October 2nd for the next book.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|Agree w/ other reviews about Escape from NY or Die Hard.  It was a fun brainless action move w/ no massive plot or subplots.  Good guys fighting bad guys with Guy Pearce having some funny one liners.  Lots of guns, explosions and needless violence. Worth renting...
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Bought the whole album because it was a great deal and I was really liking the radio song. Best purchase in a long time!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Character development is non-existent in this attempt at literature. The whole theme of male dominance vs. female submission couched in graphic sexual encounters runs out of gas well before the end of the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This trilogy kept me interested. I was up to 1 and 2 in the morning reading. I would highly recommend this book, I think men should read it too.
B003R50FRI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I think it is a must-read for everybody.  Hard to believe that it is not actually his life, I think there is some poetic license in it somewhere.  On the top of my 'best reads' list.
B005LLX582|1.0|From the myriad unintelligible lines mumbled off screen beneath layers of ethereal music to the sulking, brooding, tortured onscreen characters who can't seem to think of a single thing to say but just crank up their best hopeless, depressed expressions to a 20 or 30 minute sequence spent floating through the cosmos, moving seemingly forward through time from creation perhaps but moving the plot (there's a plot?!) absolutely nowhere whatsoever, this film was the biggest waste of time I've come across since, well, since dinosaurs walked the earth. Oh yeah. Did I mention that there are dinosaurs here too? After about 15 or 20 minutes of floating plotlessly through space or time or the freakin' cosmos or whatever the heck it was, I turned it off. Since it was on DVR, just for fun, I went back to see how long that space/time continuum sequence actually lasted and it appeared to come in right around a half an hour. Really? A half an hour of THAT?! Seriously, it would have put even Carl Sagan to sleep! I honestly have no clue what they were thinking when they made this film. I don't get this movie. Call me a rube. Call me unsophisticated. Call me a lover only of all things Michael Bay (I'm not, but go ahead if you like) but I did not get this movie. Heck, I don't WANT to get this movie. I've never felt compelled to write a film review after bailing out on the film so early along but if I can save even one of you from wasting your time with this, it's worth it. And before anyone can chastise me for writing a review without having seen the entire film, let me pose you this question: If I was to write, say, a restaurant food review and I reviewed my meal poorly stating that the dish was awful and that I stopped eating it after only one bite because the meal tasted rotten and spoiled, would my review carry less weight simply because I didn't clean my plate?! I think not. Bad is bad no matter how much, or how little, you experience. I've got to go now. I'm going to go erase this movie from my DVR. With a chainsaw.is movie from my DVR. With a chainsaw.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a fantastic piece of literature for anyone out there who wants to write their own book and sell it on Amazon Kindle. The instructions are easy to understand and it barely takes 15 minutes to get through the book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love this game !! Love these kind of games !! It makes yoy think and use your brain. Challenging game. Anyone who likes puzzle games should try it.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|The movie was well done. I read the book and was glad that I did so I could understand it better.  Husband and friend did not like the movie.  They thought it was violent and sad.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie.  I love the twist on reality and how it reminds us of many things including the ever-true, but often not listened to lesson that life is short and each of our journeys are unique, yet forever connected.
0525953728|5.0|I'd rate this book a `10' if I could.  The writing is riveting.  When the author describes the raid into Osama's camp, my heart was pounding like I was there.  The book was fascinating and so good that I could not put it down...read it in one day.  The man who wrote this is a hero.  And the men he describes as his friends are heros.  Matt debunks most of what we have been told and sets the record straight. Thank God we have men like this willing to put their lives on the line for ordinary people like you and me.<br /><br />On the whole not a political book. I did feel frustration while waiting to see if Washington was going to approve the mission or not.  Although the White House is taking credit for the kill, it is clearly obvious that it is the CIA Analysts, numerous technicians and the Navy Seals who are the heros here who deserve ALL the credit.  One CIA analyst worked diligently for years tracking down leads to locate Osama.  Without her tenacity, this would not have been possible.<br /><br />What an amazing story and a terrific read.  So glad I bought this book.  So glad the TRUE story is now out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Someone suggested this book to me, and I'm very glad they did! I was hooked from the beginning, easily going along with the story then BAM! Surprise story line.... then just as I get used to this new turn in the story... BAM!  Surprise story line... again and again.  I could not put it down. Up until the very last chapter I quit trying to predict what would happen next, because I was always wrong.  Very good, well written book.  Thoroughly enjoyed it!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|my neice loves to play this, especially when she gives a \\"shot in the butt\\" of a animal and when she cleans the animal's teeth, she laughs and giggles.  it was worth the $1.99.  would like to see more animals and symtoms added
B0011Z76RS|5.0|I originally bought and listened to this in album many years ago and now, so many years later, I still remember every lyric and remember how awesome it is!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|On that miserable day in 1994 when MTV announced that Cobain was dead I thought I wouldn't hear anymore from Dave Grohl. And then a year later he put out Foo Fighters and I was smitten. But alas I am a metal head and that is where my heart lies. And then Wasting Light found my ears and I thought \\"Yes I love this!\\". Rope, Arlandia and every song here blazes. I have always followed the Foos  career but with this album I am all in. Phenominal.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a pleasant surprise as I was expecting it to be a downer.  It has some of the same futuristic tones as 1984 as an example.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Didn't care for the style nor content of book 2.  Felt disappointed in the second book compared to the first book, and don't intent to read number 3.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|its fun and addicting. hard to put down, and not too difficult. hope there are more levels to come, because at this rate I will be done within a couple days.
B0036T1RMM|5.0|Great multi-thread story in this film about life and the strange turns it sometimes takes, and the connections that exist between its characters.  A wonderful movie, a film buff's movie.  Can't wait for The Master.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|The book was every bit as good as the other Sword of Truth series I've read. Mr. Goodkind's carictures are crisp, detailed and vibrent. The action is very believible and well written.  His backgrounds and seenery are very realiistic. I like how each book has it's own storyline. Yet, the story flows into the next book so readily. I am now trying to read each one of his stories.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Though the second was my favorite, this was close to it. We learn more about Christian as he starts to heal and more about Anna too. A few nice plot twists to spice things up and she tied up a few long running themes. A nice surprise at the ending also gives us some insight into Christian.
B007T9FRFS|4.0|This book was a fast paced, good book. I was kept interested until the end.Kathy Reichs is an excellent writer.This book was  good ,but some of her other books are better.
B00866H7SS|3.0|I don't honestly know which came first but the comparisons are uncannily similar. Though distracting at first, (having read fifty previously), I couldn't help<br />liking this story. I was very forgiving to the brush over of character development and emotional attachment I was supposed to feel from the author (I found myself filling in the blanks quite regularly)but surprisingly the diamonds in this story shone, its bedrock too interesting to ignore.
0439023521|1.0|I did not know that Book II / Catching Fire (2009) and Book III / Mockingjay (2010) were not yet released in paperback editions.  Only The Hunger Games (2008) Book I has been released in paperback edition.  Amazon misleads the buyer by not stating Book II and III are published by a different publisher other than Scholastic and it comes in Large Print.  If you like Large Print then it might be worth you money, for myself I am returning all three books UPS and heading over to Barnes & Noble tonight and buying the all three books in hardcover editions.
B005651R24|5.0|This book was a great read.<br />Very honest, lots of twists and turns, laugh out loud moments, and a brilliant - if a little unlikely - ending.<br />However, a few times I did catch myself thinking that I really didn't have conversations or thoughts that were this in-depth when I was their age. Also, the lack of capitalization for one of the Wills began as unique, but quickly descended into thoroughly irritating.<br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book immensely and happily got lost among its pages.<br />I would definitely recommend this book.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|Rented this with low expectations.  My assumption was it would be a Jumpers type formulaic movie.  I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, its no inception but solid B Sci-fi.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is one of those apps that should come standard with each Kindle!  The ease of use is wonderful and convenient for young and old alike.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I agree with concerns about permissions .  The app itself is great.  The fact that I can have it on my Thunderbolt,  Kindle and computer makes it very convenient.  Syncs all three without problems.
B0086700CM|5.0|A fun game! Gets my adrenaline flowing quickly but I can step away at any time and come back later. Simple, yet brilliant!
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Just whenever I want a laugh I find an evanovich book. When is the next book. I have read every evanovich book and as I travel people ask me what I am reading.
B0052RCX0G|5.0|This is an excellent book based upon objects held by the British Museum.  The author has very skillfully analyzed the objects with a view toward understanding the cultures in which they were produced.  Modern dating capabilities for determining when the objects were produced shows much about the evolution of mankind.
1594744769|3.0|Waited anxiously for this book, being lured by the exotic cover that caught my attention. I finally got my hands on the book, and started reading with great passion, until...<br /><br />This book simply lost steam as it went along, and could not hold my interest after 1/3rd of the book was done. I was left wondering : Hey, what happened? Everything was chugging along well, I was captivated by this eerie story and creepy pictures, until the author just seemed to start making up bizarre events, based around the pictures that he had found. He somehow got these weird interesting pictures, and thought, Hmmmm what can I build around these? And a book was born!<br /><br />The story did not seem to gel together, and the end also was so abrupt, leaving way for the sequel. What a disappointment!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Very disappointing for the hype.  When the story teller is the key character, you pretty much know how things are going to turn out!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was very good it kept my interest it wasn't just about the sex parts it was about the character's. I normally don't read love story but this one was an awesome book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not puts this book down.  I literally read it faster than any book ever and was disappointed that I had reached the end. Thank goodness that it's a trilogy and as soon as I realized that fact I hit the Amazon Store button on my Kindle and ordered Fifty Shades Of Black. I would rate this book Hot !!!
B0047WJ11G|5.0|Inception is a great movie that is well-written with lots of action.  One that can be watched more than once!  Thought-provoking and great effects.  Acting superb by all.
B008220CHO|1.0|This movie was beyond terrible.  All it did was rip off scenes from the Exorcist series & the Emily Rose movie. (Which were both great)  The acting was awful and the silly music that played throughout the movie was absolutely hysterical.  I went into the movie theatre thinking that this would be at least watchable , but i was completley disappointed.  So a little girl gets possessed by a spirit living in an evil box.  Her dad does everything he can do to rid her of this being even telling the evil spirit to come into me (which is exactly what happened in the end of the Exorcist).  Throw in the bad writing and terrible acting & there you go...thats your movie.  What i would like to do is repossess my $15 that I wasted on going to see this piece of garbage.
B0055SWM08|5.0|These puzzles are a lot of fun.  Runs great on Samsung GS II.  Fun little time-waster.  The achievements are a nice touch.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|For years I have had trouble sleeping. This app is amazing. Have used it now for a week and just LOVE IT. I go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer and feel much more rested when I wake up. Thank You For helping me sleep. Laura.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|great movie I liked it better then the first would  recommend it to all who likes this tip of movie
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written. Great story and characters with. personalities. You find yourself trying top figure<br /> Out who is in love and who is just in lust. Steamy!!!!
B0065GC0BA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story. It was a tear-jerker without the saccharine after taste! It has put me in the mood for other books by Ms Moyes.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I have always liked Stephen King including the short story\\" Duel\\" , \\"Carrie\\" , \\"The Shining\\", \\"The Talisman\\", etc.  The Dark Tower series was also excellent.[[ASIN:1451627297 11/22/63: A Novel]]
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend a few weeks ago, however I put off reading it because I thought it was going to be all about flowers which did not interest me. One night last week when I could not sleep I decided to give it a try, and the next morning I was 3/4 of the way through the story and still going strong.  While there is, of course, talk about flowers, they are by no means the main character or focus of the story.  The flowers are the supporting cast, supporting the characters throughout their stories and lives.  I do not want to give anything away because I found this book to be such an enjoyable journey, and unpredictable.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love this movie! It's so sweet and heartfelt! It was supper easy to download and it didn't take long at all.
B003TSE8K8|5.0|My grandmother first read this to me when I was four years old. 24 years later I have read it again...and the Dahl magic is still there! He combines vivid images of childhood delights with a wicked sense of humour. Although targeted at younger readers, Dahl awakens the senses from ever adults youthful memories. A true classic which will be around for years to come.<br /><br />Join Charlie Bucket on his once-in-a-lifetime adventure. Get lost with him in Wonker's Chocolate Factory and meet the many colourful characters he encounters on his journey.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|And may the odds be forever in your favor!.... Chilling words if there ever were any  I'm the dystopia community of panem. I enjoyed hunger games so much I saw it twice! Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as katniss.
B005EGXTHG|2.0|Trilogy got worse the further along it progressed. First book was well crafted, I felt the second and third books struggled to capture the spark of the first.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome book. There's more to the story than just the obvious. It was very well written and kept me engaged.  Great idea to sell them as a trilogy for Kindle.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was almost an exact duplicate of the 50 Shades Trilogy.  No originality from the author.  About the only difference were the names.
B008602KQI|5.0|I recive the product before the time line which was very nice, and I have been watching it every day, I love it
B000FC13MM|5.0|this is an excellent fantasy at once adhering to the formula of rites of passage and growth which mark the best fantasy stories and which also explores an otherworld with freshness and panache.  highly recommended.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It actually keeps me busy. Nice mental challenge. I barley started the game but but the first 3 levels were fun to play.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|A minimum of 6 subplots that go nowhere.  80% of Hollywood films have 1 or 2 subplots that go nowhere.  Here, you get disappointed about every 10 minutes starting about the 30 minute point.  One pointless moment after another.  I guess that is what a secular Hollywood has become.  I go to very few movies and blew it going to this one.  I was close to walking out.  Don't see it, don't buy it.  Some really gruesome stuff anyway.
B008602KQI|4.0|I think they did a very good job making the book into a movie. You always loose some when you do so because some things don't translate easily.<br /><br />They did a good job of casting in my opinion. I would ignore any comments of \\"That was a bad choice for that role\\" or \\"That Char wasn't supposed to be (Black/Asian/Latino)\\"<br /><br />I have a friend who's first reaction was \\"They are supposed to be starving!\\" They did ignore the issue. They could have played it up better without spending to much time on it.<br /><br />Best Casting in the whole movie (IMHO) was Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. (Donald Southerland was second) But turn the man loose in the role. So many things that make Haymitch and Woody could have done well.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The first time I requested a refund.  The writing was atrocious and sophomoric.  How an author like this reaches the best seller list is beyond me.
B008BM9L72|3.0|The story line was good It was not particulary well written and after a while the sexual encounters where a bit boring. The characters where very likable and I missed them when I finished the read.I liked the ending
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app! Easy to underdstand and looks good. One of the best apps I have downloaded. highly. recommend. to all
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I chose this book because the reviews were good.  The first few pages were a tad confusing, but once I got past them I've hardly been able to put it down.  I definately recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great page turner.  I love the way the author went back and fourth with the different characters and that there was just the right amount of drama, action and romance
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Movie was action packed with a softer side of sadness, laughter, and joy. It hit every emotion and always keeping you interested in what will come next. The ending left you upset because you want to know how the story will end.<br />Shipping was fast and packaging was solid.
0525953728|5.0|Received the book this afternoon and just finished it - whew!<br /><br />I honestly believe this to be one of those books that tells it like it is; no Hollywood heroics, no fancy tech-speak - you hear the good and the bad as well as the quirky.<br /><br />From the pranks pulled during down-time to the fast paced descriptions of running gunfights with our enemies, you get a small peek into the real world of the Navy SEAL. These guys are no joke; they can turn up the heat and bring on the hurt - and the next day be back at home tending to their lawns, paying bills and changing diapers.<br /><br />If you have read any of the many books coming out of the experiences in Iraq or Afghanistan, you need to add this one to your collection as well.
1416550534|4.0|I'm pretty demanding and had already read \\"The Distant Hours\\" which although a good book, definitely did not live up to the hype. I hoped that \\"The House at Riverton\\" had been more closely scrutinized by the Publisher's editorial staff then Ms. Morton's subsequent books (something \\"Distant Hours\\" sorely needed). I find that editors seem to feel they can back off editing content on popular author's books - almost always a mistake.<br /><br />\\"The House on Riverton\\" kept me engaged. Her characters very interesting and her plot clear. I do feel the main character Grace was at times a bit of a twit. Her own \\"secret\\" (readers will probably figure this out quick) really didn't do much for the story. I thought there would be more drama attached to it, but other than Grace's personal revelation and a better understanding of Grace's mother - nothing is really done.<br /><br />Ms Morton's description of Grace's aging self in first person was done very well (especially at the end). Her slide from just aged to senility and the understanding her end is near was skillfully written.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book. If you loved \\"The Distant Hours\\" you won't be disappointed.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|I enjoy watching Mark Wahlberg but was disappointed at the amount of foul language.I can deal with some but it was way over the top and I just don't care to listen to it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have only played this game once. I downloaded it for my daughter and my husband is addicted she dont even get to play it much
B0018QQQK8|3.0|First, at all costs, avoid the movie. It does no justice to the book. The book isn't bad... I'd rate it 3.5, but that's only because I found some parts to drag on. I've only recently started reading Spark's books.  I did feel this book was a bit slow, but still overall enjoyable
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Hope this is the last one!  Got more and more tedious!  Does anything ever have a true conclusion?  This is the 5th book on the same thing with basically the same \\"people\\".  Time to end this saga.  Tired of it, & do NOT plan to read anymore.  In fact, I did not finish # 5! Enough already.
0553801473|1.0|I am so over these books.  I am almost positive that he wrote this without an outline, it wanders.  Martin is at best a mediocre talent and this book will completely cure your insomnia.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|The product was exactly as I expected it- the song is great, it works on my computer.  I Can't complain.
B005DD7JL2|4.0|I must say that I have seen several if not all of the video game made to movie attempts and this one was a welcome suprise!
B0068CARXY|5.0|This Rihanna album is awesome! Just about every song is good and one or two are only OK. Usually I only like a few songs on a CD so buy them individually , but I bought this because I like so many of the songs. Love Rihanna!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There wasn't a thing I didn't love about Fifty Shades Freed.  It was the perfect ending to the trilogy, but at the same time left me wanting more of their story (Christian's story...I really liked reading the book from his point of view).  Christian Grey is perfect and if he really exists, I'd definitely like to cross paths.<br /><br />I've actually read the book about three times and I think it is more than an erotic novel, but a great love story and a testament that love helps you overcome your demons.
B007P3TMW2|5.0|This film was difficult to watch at times, but the final scene was worth every moment of previous discomfort. Thomas Horn, a young actor who played the main role, delivered a stellar performance, with wisdom beyond his years about how to portray this part. Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock playing his parents, provided the framework for his story rather than being the main event they both do so well. Between the beginning and ending scenes, the story was a beautiful patchwork of moments, emotions, and people all connected by this one tragic event and a young boy's persistent quest to fulfill his father's last challenge. God is good, and brings about goodness from evil. Very uplifting.
B007VYQ9G2|5.0|When the filmmakers who brought the Disneynature feature film Chimpanzee to the movie screen, they may have expected some hazards (wait until you see the eye-popping bonus feature in which they're constantly tormented by bees), but they never expected a rare and amazing story to tell itself right before their cameras.<br /><br />A young chimp, named Oscar for the film, suffers a difficult loss and a astonishing gain. Sorry if that's too much of a spoiler, but that is only one of the experiences you will share in this, perhaps the most remarkable of the Disneynature film series. Tim Allen narrates with a fine blend of warmth, concern and humor as this chimpanzee troup lives through various challenges, searches for food and has fun -- like most families.<br /><br />The film is so engrossing, the 78 minutes seem to fly by. Generous bonus sequences that chronicle the creation of the film, though not as plentiful for DVD users, are almost as fascinating as the film itself. If you see this on Blu-ray, prepare for a breathtaking ride. Some of the scenes are so lush and painterly, they look as if they came from a classic Disney animated feature -- particularly a stunning long upward pan resembling a fantastic mulit-plane Disney sequence.<br /><br />Young children may be unnerved by some of the material, and there is a disclaimer about the bee sequence -- it's that intense.<br /><br />it's nice to be able to watch this from a comfy chair in a climate-controlled room and be grateful to the filmmakers for going to such extreme lengths to capture all of this for all of us to experience.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Para mi es la mejor pelicula que existio, el Bluray, super bueno y con muchos extras. Lo super recomiendo. La Calidad super buena y el audio increible.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I think I liked this season even more than the first. The zombies are more of a fact of life more easily taken care of, and now the real moral issues begin. Is is okay to abandon a little girl lost (and probably eaten) in the forest at the risk of losing everyone else? Should you have a baby during the zombie apocalypse? What would you do to protect the little bit of normality left to you? Kill dead people? Sacrifice others? Kill living people after your secret hideout? Lie to everyone around you? Or do you just have the right to \\"opt out\\"?<br /><br />And in this season when regulars die, you feel it a bit more since you've gotten to know them more. You think, 'oh we've survived so much', then WHAM zombie attack! Dead! I've never read the graphic novels, but during the ending moments when the scene pans out and you see where they have stopped for the night I gasped a little. Oh no. Season three is going to be bad. Very very bad....for the characters. For us, it will probably be a really good time. :)<br /><br />So, if you liked season one just for the zombie gore, you may not like season two as much. But, if you like to dig a little deeper, then this is the season for you.
B00005R23S|5.0|Bruce and the E Street Band give it their all - this is one of their best concert performances and a must see for fans both old and young!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus is a fascinating collection short stories about life in a post apocalyptic environment.  Locked underground in their \\"Silo\\" the survivors live in an engineered society designed to control their thoughts and actions until the above world is ready for re-colonization.  The author has created very interesting characters who challenge the status quo.  The book is well written and was hard to put down (except for the occasional tendency to be overly verbose in his descriptions).  In short, this is the best science fiction book I have read in quite a while and highly recommend it.  It also happens to be an excellent value!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books are by far the best that i have read, ever. If you like the hunger games series you will definitely love these. Book 1 is good and they only continue improving to book 5 which is amazing. Looking forward to more.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good basic solitaire app with many options for gameplay. grapics are good. to move a card you don't need to drag it; if you tap it it will move to the available spot (this makes gameplay easier). ads are annoying but generally not intrusive. would give 4.5 if i could.
B008602KQI|5.0|I saw the movie before I read the book, and it was an awesome movie. But when I read the book, I realized there is so much that we dont get to see in the movie. Much of it being Katniss' thoughts which play a big role in her character. A lot of missing important scenes, especially the fact that Peetah is near death at the end of the hunger games in the book but in the movie he is normal. He loses a leg in the book...that is something very important that comes to play in the next 2 books yet the movie writers left it out completely from the movie. Still, it was a good movie and I cannot wait for \\"Catching Fire\\" to come out.
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Nothing complicated in terms of action or plot, but the relationships were fascinating. Family relationships and how they develope and intertwine were beautifully portrayed.
B008602KQI|5.0|The Hunger Games movie followed the book beautifully and was compelling to watch. I'm definitely looking forward to the sequel next November. :)
B006CBSE86|5.0|I recently purchased this album after listening to a few tracks on youtube. I have long been a fan of Nightwish and I wholeheartedly recommend this album. It has a nice mix of conventional radio tracks, a few longer tracks in Nightwish style, and a couple of ballads that allow the lead singer to show off her talents.
B0086700CM|3.0|every one says that this game crashes are lags. Is that true? Should I still get it? Does any one have an answer for me?
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Helpful product that is easy to use & access via multiple platforms. I have Kindle Fire, a laptop and a cell phone that easily sync. Minor issues with duplicate dates showing when multiple accounts visible. Best calendar I have used by far...and I checked quite a lot.
B0088TG252|3.0|Movie: C-<br />Acting: B-<br />Plot: D<br />Overall: C<br /><br />Very weak plot. Storyline makes zero sense. If your going to make an unbelievable movie, add some super powers.
B001NLJ33K|5.0|This movie has everything for those of us who want action, adventure, great plots, good overcoming evil, and LOVE. I really enjoyed the thrills in speeding to Cuba in a boat, outwitting the bad guys, and forgiving a girl who went astray. Colin and Jamie were a great pair as Crockett and Tubbs, and good looking also.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but wish there was more to the ending. It ended too abruptly for me and I still want more!
B008602KQI|3.0|I'm the big fan of the original book. So even the movie was pretty good, i thought it was too PG-13
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book follows Book One and is as erotic as well as gives more of the story. With all the hype the story evolves the mystery of the story and sends one's interest directly to the third book. Our kindles make reading these books very portable and available in every situation without being recognized as what others might considered as a smutty book(not our label). We have read this trilogy more than once and have recomended it to friends. ;) :D
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Great scenery is the backdrop of this formulaic allegory of nature's revenge against the wanton, selfish destruction of our planet by humans. The characters and plot line are uber cliche, but well worth enduring to be treated<br />to an extremely satisfying conclusion of the tale.
0307951529|5.0|As a soon-to-be small business owner, I find this book to be filled with advice that I will actually use. Chris provides many tools within its pages, like one that gives you detailed steps on how to launch a new product or business. I need these kinds of things & before I read it, I didn't really know that I did. Plus, there's nothing better than words and people who give the message, too, that it's ALL possible, and here's how.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple calculator, does what I need to do. love it. hard to find an app that sticks to its intended use. this one does, and it does it well.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Awesome book. i would highly recommend to everyone. Very hard to put down once you start.<br />So if you want a great book to read. You must choose this one. 5 Stars!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is an excellent watch for adults and children over the age of 10 (with parental supervision).  There are some graphic scenes, but the storyline is exceptionally written!  My daughter had read the book prior to watching the movie and commented on how well the movie followed the book, with the exception to a few items left out of the movie.  Great movie!  We watch it again and again!
B008M34INW|4.0|funny and interesting. Good to watch on a Saturday night, some of the scenes were hilarious although others were on the edge of being too serious
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Hunger Games and the following two books give an excellent example for teens of a bad political situation and how revelutions start.  A little exaggerated, but still good.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|While there are a few songs that bog down the record (such as \\"Why am I the One\\"...not my favourite), \\"Some Nights\\" is enjoyable to listen to, and you'd have to be dead not to have caught \\"We are Young\\" on T.V. or the radio. \\"Some Nights\\" is, in my opinion, the best song of the album. I think that the use of autotune/synthesising helps rather than hinders, giving it a fuller and (dare I say it) epic sound. I'm definitely glad I bought it and will be listening to it on repeat for a long time.
B000FC146C|5.0|When I read this book years ago, I fell in love with the many dimensional characters.  I always felt as if I were part of the story, spanning the ages, loving and hurting along with these people.  I am revisiting The Thorn Birds to re-establish the bond I felt first time around. I don't remember what I paid for my Kindle version, but it just doesn't matter.  This is a beautiful read, you won't be sorry.
B008602KQI|5.0|Well, let me just say in my opinion about how well I think the movie has told the story I read in the book. AWESOME..WELL DONE!!<br />The movie did such a good job with Katniss and Peeta's feelings about actually \\"in the games\\" made me cry and \\" feel\\" right along with the actors!!  Kudos!!  After watching this dvd I went right back to reading the book..fantastic!!!<br />I thank you for bringing it on screen! It showed me just how lucky I am..we all are.. to live in the world we do live in, even with all the \\"stuff\\" that is going on, good and bad.  We are lucky..think about it for a minute, after watching this movie where would you be living???
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The three books were interesting.  I must confess that the only reason I purchased the trilogy was because of all the hype that it was getting.  There were some things in those books that I never heard of but it still was an interesting read and would recommend the books to friends.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|Great story,acting,and action! This movie jumps to life at the very beginning and doesn't stop until the end! Do not watch this one if you want something boring!!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I had played the free version for almost a year and still found it challinging. the full version has twice the catagories and more than four times the layouts. fabulous for 99 cents. Also never had an issue with freeze ups.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Not what I expected  , as  the only recommendation I had for the book was the fact that it had been the no 1 bestseller for weeks! It was an interesting read in that it showed how taste for books and bestsellers have changed over the years. The fact that it has been on the bestseller list for weeks tends to show the shift in readers mentality and outlook.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|The Best of American Horror Classics! Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi are Geniuses! Need more from these two! Can't wait for the remake..
B000TEVII0|5.0|Classic Celtic music sung the incredibly talented ladies of Celtic Woman. Songs in English and Gaelic, instrumentals, and an overall beautiful sound.
B008XG1X18|5.0|now I can enjoy my favorite time waster on my kindle fire too. sometimes it doesn't load for a minute though you just have to close it and reopen it.
B008602KQI|2.0|After reading the book (which I loved), the movie was not impressive. Had I not read the book first, I wouldn't have known what was going on or why.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic reading, easy story line to follow. I am into the third book and the continuation is great. I highly recommend this triology.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It was an excellent read. I just couldn't put the book down! It was different - I never guessed the twist in advance! I'm really looking forward to reading the next  2 books!
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Would highly recommend this book.  I wasn't sure when I first purchased it as I was worried it would be a fluffy romance, which it wasn't. I really enjoyed it and found it engaging.  The situation the characters are in is very complex and you really don't know what choices they are going to make until the very end.  I will be looking for other books by this author.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not sure what all the bad reviews are about I loved it. I could not put the book down, and can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. the story line, the charachters even the x rated scenes draw you in and make you become a part of the book. Yeah, a bit repetitive , I agree. some lines are exactly the same , but to me this didn't take away from the intensity of the book.
B008602KQI|5.0|A++++++++++++++++++++++++Excellent Movie, Saw it in the theatre and I had to own it. You will watch it over and over again. Lots of action and a great love story of survival.
B008602KQI|4.0|i read the book a couple years back and enjoyed it quite a bit so i was a little disappointed by the ending since they cut out a decent chunk of how the book finished. though if they make a sequel and continue it from the point they ended on i may need to get it
B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book is definitely not worthy of the scandal it's brought about in the States...it's as if no one in the US has ever read a romance novel, for crying out loud!!  Ok, this is a bit darker than your average romance novel, but nothing out of this world, really.  It is an entertaining read. Not going to win a literary award by any means, but it's nice, light reading with just the right amount of action, sex and psychology to keep you thoroughly entertained. I highly recommend this novel if the description here meets what you're looking for.
0425263908|3.0|Bared to You has been compared to 50 Shades of Grey for some obvious reasons. They both feature dysfunctional characters/abuse victims who buck their modus operandi and fall in love for the first time. Lots of sex ensues (but without the whips and gags in this book). In many ways this is a superior book. It is more polished and tightly crafted. On the other hand, the characters aren't as dynamic and I didn't find myself particularly interested in their story. The plot is not especially believable either, but I can suspend my disbelief for a good read, so that's not a problem. I may read the sequel, just not sure yet.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Great Movie Stands up to other Disney classics. Started out a little slow but by the end it was great.
B0086700CM|4.0|My daughter and I both love the game. It is super addictive fun. Watching her play is amazing... she really gets into it and sadly, I've been caught playing it for an hour at a time! It is sometimes laggy and fails to recognize a command, which is only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Get this game and the Brave version if you have kids who liked the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing! I read the entire trilogy in three and a half days- I could not put my kindle down.  I am hoping the author does a little bit more on the series and I can't wait for the movie to come out.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I rank it right up there with my favorite online game, Chips Revenge, as a fairly easy way to exercise my brain using logical thinking.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's so fluffy!!! This movie has cute characters and several funny moments throughout. Steve Carrell does a great job. The minions made the movie for me though.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Keeping this short but I definately recommend this album. Not it's not as heavy as some of their older stuff but still amazing. I love the new sound, can't say how many times I've listened to this cd as I've lost count. Great work from ITM!
B008602KQI|5.0|A very different kind of story. Stimulates the imagination. Very enjoyable. Am looking forward to the next episode. Will this be OUR future?
B00796E7CA|5.0|This book once again fills in more of the gaps left between The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings.  The section on Hurin was new at the time this book was written but has been filled in even more in The Children of Hurin.  The only dull part is the usual foreward where Christopher explains why he presented information in a certain format.  The forewards area always good to put me to sleep.  It was nice to read more about Numenor and Galadriel also.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|All I have to say is....... Heath Ledger.  There will never be another Joker like him.  The new Batman movie is almost as good.
B002GLSX8C|5.0|If you don't know Led Zeppelin, this is a wonderful introduction. If you're already a fan, this video has an amazing soundtrack featuring all of their best songs. Provides insight with behind-the-scenes and interviews about the rise of one of Rock history's greatest bands. I would watch it again.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|This video took me back to the 60s in full force.  Most of the pieces were excellent, well written and interesting.  The music, the mood, and the graphics were psychadelic.  The band members are aging gracefully and they really brought back the energy and fun from those days.
B003UBTX72|5.0|A NO HOLDS BARRED DOWN TO THE BONE ACCOUNT OF KEITH/STONES HISTORY THRU THE GOOD AND THE BAD PAST.VERY WELL WRITTEN!
B008602KQI|3.0|It was ok. I felt if you had not read the books you would be slightly lost. Books are always better then the movies.
B006PFC2FA|4.0|Great musical with a unique premise.  During an age of inocense when you still had sexual tension and not a stop watch.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Certainly a view of the Japanese sushi restaurant business not well-known to most people I know.  Very up-beat and inspirational though forecasting clouds.  The home-made feel of camera views and seemingly candid revelations, make for a fun story-telling experience.
0345803507|2.0|Loved the first book in this series; the 2nd book was ok; and this third book is just ridiculous and unrealistic.  I can barely get through it, and will finish only because once I've started a book I've got to see it through to the end.
B000L9EKL0|4.0|I've always found this movie to be great since the first time I saw it. Now I finally own it and it works great...although I still see no difference between blue ray and a regular DVD.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|movie touches on great social commentary and it pulls in key elements of original movie... provides great back story for the original film.<br />seller was very prompt with sending movie, greatly appreciated.
B008IZ72SW|5.0|I don't have cable, so I have been waiting a while to watch season 6. Best season so far well worth the wait!
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Really enjoyed this book. Good characters and a fun plot. End was just ok but it is worth your time.
B001N1TWZO|3.0|While Pearl Buck has been one of my favorite writers since I was young, this is not my fav of hers.  In fact, I understand why I had never before heard of it until I saw it on Amazon. Although the descriptions are good, the story is a bit mundane and definitely lacking. I hate to give any author I love a weak rating, but this is a \\"C\\" in my book.
0446572993|4.0|Balducci is an excellent storyteller and in this novel weaves a credible, thoughtful action filled tale.  A modern morality tale with the right balance of elements to remain enjoyable.
B007FU1OH6|5.0|absolutely loved it. as usual the author makes this book just as spellbinbing as the two before. cant wait for the next edition.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Intriguing, gripping, twisting, can't put it down book.  Uniquely written and with a perspective not often found.  Loved it! Not sure that I loved the ending, but it surely was a terrific book! With out giving too much away...it does make you think twice about the way society can lay judgement.
0061906220|4.0|I was introduced to this book by a ministerial candidate who received the book from her grandkids.  She shared it during her service talk.  It was fun, uplifting and so very simple that we not only laughed but got the significance of the message loud and clear.  I love my shoes (journey/experience) no matter what happens.  Pete the Cat is awesome!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Wow -- kind of hypnotic. Kind of irksome too, in a &quot;What the ... ??&quot; way. I didn't know that would go through there -- it doesn't LOOK like a loop. &quot;Hedgehog&quot; award, once you've impaled yourself on enough spikes -- Yeah, that's funny, guys.  Simple game, but challenging puzzles of moves -- &amp; endless re-plays.

0525953728|3.0|No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden by Mark Owen and Kevin Maurer<br /><br />Before I start with the formal review, let me state that my goal for all my reviews is to provide fellow readers with an honest assessment of the quality of the book. It has nothing to do with my feelings about whether the author should have written the book or not. I have the utmost respect and admiration for these young heroes. I am in awe of what they do and I thank them from the bottom of my heart for all the great sacrifices that they make for the sake of our country. The best to \\"Mark Owen\\" and the SEAL family. Now back to the review.<br /><br />\\"No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden\\" is the cautious firsthand SEAL's account of one of the most newsworthy missions ever. Ex-Navy Seal and member of elite SEAL Team Six \\"Mark Owen\\" provides the reader with a personal and firsthand account of what actually happened on the night of his most noteworthy mission and other interesting assignments that occurred during his career as a SEAL from 1998 to 2012. This 336-page book is composed of nineteen chapters but is in essence can be broken out into two halves: the first half, is about his training and his development as a SEAL and all his assignments not including the night that led to Bin Laden's death; the second half is strictly about the main mission and what turned out to be the most interesting part of this book. What hurts this otherwise fascinating and mesmerizing topic is the lack of details that most likely were kept out because of legal considerations. The quality of the book suffered as a result of it.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. As fascinating a topic as you will ever find.<br />2. Well-written and provides an inside look into the courageous world of a Navy SEAL at a very accessible level.<br />3. The author has a humble sense of honor that permeates the book.<br />4. What it takes to be a SEAL Team Six/DEVGRU member. The training, the mental toughness, the courage and the missions associated with such an elite team.<br />5. The brief history of SEAL Team Six.<br />6. The first half the book covers the author's training and those missions prior to the mission at Abbottabad. He goes into some details of the main missions he was involved with and the role he played for that assigned mission.<br />7. The weaponry, the gadgets...I wanted more!<br />8. Interesting look at collaboration between teams and outside resources.<br />9. At times, you feel you are right in the middle of the action. The author captures some of the adrenaline rush that happens during a mission and most importantly how the element of surprise and the unexpected plays out. \\"One of the key lessons learned early on in a SEAL's career was the ability to be comfortable being uncomfortable\\".<br />10. The mission to save the Maersk Alabama's captain Richard Phillips was a very interesting one and illustrates many of the variables involved with such a mission.<br />11. I enjoy SEAL jargon and all their running jokes. For instance \\"pax\\" are people,<br />12. Interesting though limited insight into the logistics involved with the missions.<br />13. The practical difficulties that SEALS encounter including having to deal with some restrictive policies. The failed missions or missions that did not meet their ultimate objectives...<br />14. The second half of the book, basically from chapter 9 on is where the book really takes off. This of course, deals with the mission to get Bin Laden or as referred to, UBL.<br />15. The inside scoop, from the pre-planning, the mission and the return home including a visit with the President. This is by far the best part of the book and the author succeeds in giving you a firsthand account on what really happened.<br />16. A brief history of the formation of Al Qaeda.<br />17. A surprise element (I won't spoil it) that ties the beginning of the book with the visit to meetthe President.<br />18. What happened to the author a year after the Bin Laden mission or Operation Neptune Spear if you must.<br />19. A confirming sources/Bibliography section.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No doubt about it, the author was restricted and perhaps in the bigger picture rightfully so but it obviously hurt the overall quality of the book. He goes to great pains to tell the reader that he has protected tactics, techniques and procedures and that if you are looking for secrets this is not your book.<br />2. A book intended for the masses as this was, merited an appendix that included pictures, specifications of all the weaponry and large assets. There is a brief photo insert but not enough to do the book justice. I understand some of its confidential but certainly there is enough unclassified information that could have been shared and would have added value to the book.<br />3. The second half of the book is vastly more interesting than the first half and saves this book from being generic.<br />4. Very little on family life and the obvious difficulties in being able to maintain a marriage. Once again, it may have something to do with protecting the identities.<br />5. I hate to say it but there are better books on this very topic. Look at my further suggestions for books on this and related topics.<br />6. There wasn't any major surprises in the book. Much of what was here I have either read or saw on the news.<br /><br />In summary, reservations aside I still enjoyed the book. The looming legal restrictions diluted what could have been a much better book and quite frankly there are much better books out there but there is something to be said for a personal account of what happened. It's my contention that the layperson will enjoy this book more than the more avid reader of this genre. Be that as it may, the fascinating firsthand account of the Abbottabad mission that ended Bin Laden's life is what makes this book worthwhile to read.<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:0307955575 Manhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden--from 9/11 to Abbottabad]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B001PO6APO Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden]]\\" by Peter L.

1576754227|5.0|I like this book a lot and it has helped me with my time management flaws. It is a very easy read - which I think is a great thing! If you have time management issues are you going to sit down and get through a 350 page book? (Just thought I would throw that in based on the few negative reviews on here).<br /><br />With this book you will get a bunch of simple strategies that you can into use right away. The thing that has helped me the most from this book is making lists based on my goals and prioritizing what I need to get done daily, weekly, monthly, and long-term.<br /><br />I appreciate the variety of tactics that Tracy has compiled in this short book. In all reality one is probably not going to be able to implement all 21 steps into his or her life. I read the entire book and found a handful that applied the most to my life and I have put them to use. This is truly a book that can be used and prove beneficial to those that need a boost in time management.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|------------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season\\"<br />(AMC, 2012)<br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />In its second season, the live-action adaptation of Robert Kirkman's \\"Walking Dead\\" moves from its emergence as a thrilling new show into a top-notch TV drama. Fans of the comicbook series that the show is based on simply have to let go of the original narrative - the television producers made a clear decision to depart from the strict confines of the print version. Many characters are the same, and the overall zombie-plague scenario remains, but there are many significant changes. And changes for the better, I'd have to say. The comics are great, but so is this show, and I think the move to have the TV show be its own thing is fine -- the scripts are great, the drama is riveting, and the cast are taking ownership of the characters, giving them their own voices. The show is still character-driven, more about the moral crucible of disaster and how each person deals with the tensions between communal effort and individual survival, but the horror, when we see it, is also pretty freaky and intense.<br /><br />All in all, AMC's \\"Walking Dead\\" is an unqualified success, with the second season much stronger than the first, and the third season a must-see as well. I can't wait. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|good controls and no annoying unnecessary screens. picks up where you left off. kudos to the developers for thinking things through. please make more games
0316066524|1.0|What the ~HECK~ is this book? It is called \\"INFINITE JETS\\" but there is not a single aircraft within, in fact the book is about people on land with drugs problems. THIS IS A BAIT AND SWITCH. I guess the ~JETS~ could be describing how the characters get \\"HIGH\\" but in my opinion this is just a cheap trick to sell this book to avid fans of AERONAUTICS such as myself.<br /><br />I collect books like \\"JANE'S\\" which show many jets and describe the jets so obviously a ~HEAVY TOME~ named \\"INFINITE JETS\\" should satisfy my jet needs for at least a few months. But no, no jets at all. Just tennis and complaining. The book contains many 'end-notes' but none of them are about jets either.<br /><br />This book is something like eight thousand pages and has no pictures at all. The author seems to think he is a ~BIG SMARTIE~ but he is not a prophet he seems like a dumb POTHEAD, and also he obviously knows NOTHING about jets.<br /><br />I would not recommend you purchase this book unless you hate jets. There are many other, better, books about jet planes and most of them are NOT named so misleadingly.<br /><br />Mr. Foster Wallace -- I want my money back.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Este libro es un tremendo aporte para todos los que hacen gimnasia con poco tiempo, que somos la mayoría, tiene la gran ventaja de ordena los ejercicios para que cada uno pueda darle la secuencia. ademas, y en mi opinión. es la mayor contribución, es que puedes usarlo como guia si tienes un Personal Trainner en un gimnasio. muchas veces los entrenadores personales siguen las mismas rutinas para casi todos sus alumnos; con el apoyo de este libro la orientacion será mas efectiva.<br /><br />es un libro recomendable para todos los que deseamos iniciar un programa serio de entrenamiento sin perdidas de tiempo, cada dolor muscular o articular sabemos que vale la pena y no es simplemente una lesion por un ejercicio mal hecho.<br /><br />un abrazo para todos los entusiatas del fitness.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the series. Excellent read. It was a good conclusion to the trilogy although I wish there was yet another book.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|If you like disaster movies like me, you might like this one.  It's not that realistic, but still pretty good.
B008MEM24S|1.0|Purchased product, but can't find where you sent it so cannot load it to my devise. Would really like to find the app to begin using it and truly give you a fine review.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I had forgotten how good and satisfying Ms Mitchell's music could sound. So many memories. Another treasure reclaimed. I believe that she could teach this and successive generations about subtlety in music. So fine.
0817439390|5.0|I bought this book because a photography blog had mentioned what a great read it was in terms of basic photography concepts.  I have always read manuals inside and out, and have used compact digital cameras extensively.  However when I have messed around with DSLR's, I never knew what to do with the aperature or shutter priority modes.  This book is a super easy read, and clearly conveys the concepts behind aperature, shutter speed and iso.  I would happily recommend this book to anybody who wants to learn about the basic photographic elements.  The only thing I wish there was more of an explanation on, is lenses.  He has added some sections on filters, flash and HDR, but I think a couple of pages on lenses (in addition to what he has) would be very welcome.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Recommended so highly by my students, I knew I had to read this book.  Now I see what they mean! The characters are so quirky and relatable; I couldn't help but fall in love with them even though from the start I knew they might not make it to the end.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I really love this game its entertaining but I really dislike the fact that you have to buy coins. Without coins you cant buy more characters...I wish the characters cost the same way the other products work,by the money you make in the cafe...the only way i could expand my employees is by buying coins to buy the character. Thats the only problem other than that its a cute game.
