1594484805|5.0|I was fascinated with Daniel's book about the brain. As a parent of 6 I am interested in how to help motivate my kids. This book poses theories I have long believed ... rewarding achievement leads to a lack of drive. A must read for teachers and parents especially of people under 10.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have every James Bond movie and this one is fantastic.  The action was unbelievable!!  I recommend it to everyone.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Cool relationships and psychology between characters. Only downside is that the glossary is hard to access and the price is a bit steep
B007HACDLK|5.0|Action from cover to cover with twist and turns that you do not expect. Makes you wonder how much of this is really happening.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|The game starts. You read the first two pages of the story then it send you back to the opening
B0019TYQ38|5.0|Emma Thompson was excellent. I watched the scene where she discovers Edward is not married, three times. I cried each time.<br />I really enjoyed Alan Rickman also, he is always a pleasure to watch in all of his movies.<br />The movie followed the book very closely and I was happy to find that so much of it was put into less than 2 and a half hours.
B005LAII62|5.0|Paranorman for me is one of the best animated movies of 2012. It tells the story of Norman, a seemingly norman boy with a very abnormal gift for seeing spirits of the dearly departed. As a result of his gift he is named as the towns freak and has become an outcast, but he soon learns that his gift for speaking to the dead could be the key to saving his town from the wrath of a vengeful spirit of the towns witch.<br /><br />Upon looking at the trailers you may think that it's only a kids movie, that is where you are wrong. This world is dark and while there are some comedic moments it is still a very creepy story. Another thing this movie does right is the character, they are all unique and colorful and not one annoyed me, which is extremely rare. If you're going to judge the movie based on the trailers don't, there are plot twists in this movie that you wouldn't see coming in the trailers and one of which near the climax had be crying, yes crying. The animation is also simply gorgeous, if you're looking to getting into stop motion animation this is the film to start with.<br /><br />What else can I say about this movie? It's fantastic. This movie isn't just for kids it's for adults as well and in all honesty it was really pushing that PG rating. With a great plot, great characters, unexpected twists, good humor, and gorgeous animation there is no way I can't recommend this movie to everyone. If your into ghost stories of any kind or just animation in general pick this movie up.

B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book to be good. I wish Dr. A would have answered the questions he asked while on the other side however. He is a Dr. And therefore he used a lot of medical terms I could not understand but in all the message was received that there is life after death.

B007H9B8FS|5.0|I've been a huge Garbage fan since the first album in 1995.  One of the things I've always loved about them is how their style changes from album to album - a bit grungey and punk-ey on the first one, to more electronica and pop-ey on the second one, to quirky and maybe a little preachy (in a good way) on the third one, to more \\"straight rock\\" on the fourth - but it always sounds like Garbage, and I've always loved it all.  I remember with Beautiful Garbage, it took a few listens for me to get into it, and then - BAM - I found myself completely rocking out to Cherry Lips and it was all over.  Now it's one of my favorite Garbage albums (right next to the other ones, heh).<br /><br />I've found the experience to be similar with this new one.  I do wish they'd led the album off with Blood For Poppies, I Hate Love, or The One - these three tracks just scream Garbage from the first few seconds, and they make this old Garbage fan's heart sing.  Instead they started with Automatic Systematic Habit, which I like but doesn't have the same \\"Garbage\\" feel.  I chalk it up to that style differentiation that I've always recognized in them and leave it at that, but after a 7-year hiatus I would've appreciated a stronger \\"Hello.\\"<br /><br />Setting aside my quibbles about the first track, I agree with one of the other reviewers who mentioned that they seem to return to a number of their previous styles in the different tracks here.  It's fun to listen and peg which album any individual track might've been initially \\"left off\\" from.  There are a few tracks that don't do it for me - the aforementioned first track, Battle In Me, and Sugar come immediately to mind - but by and large, this is well worth your time.  Perhaps most importantly, if you're a Garbage fan, I have great news:<br /><br />They're back.

0440244412|2.0|Terrible book, like others - I enjoyed the series very much but I started losing the love in the 4th book,  but this was horrible.<br />I skipped over alot and just don't care, I realized I hated the main characters now and wanted them all to just die.  we know Mac, yet this book goes on and on with her thoughts about herself, and its the same crud over and over just in a different room. but now she is the end all be all to herself and the world and I wasn't buying it, I liked her before and then just wanted her to drop dead.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I bought this case along with my Kindle Fire overall it's a nice case. I would only change one thing,when it's standing up it can easily pop out of the indent line used to make it stand. I would have put a larger lip on the end to prevent this from happening. The case is pretty much heavy duty and does what it needs to. When closed it is secure and the band is easy to move around when wanting to open
B001E75QGG|5.0|In case you people forget, the 1950's is perfect for an alien setting. Many things happened in the 1950s regarding aliens and people think the government covered it up. I think it was great to put that into the movie combined with the cold war.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter-in-law shared this app with me. She had already progressed to a fairly high level and I found the puzzles to be very challenging. I acquired a copy for my new Kindle Fire and have spent a lot of time working through the levels. I love this game because it gives my brain a good workout, lets me proceed at my own pace, and lets me make some progress in just a couple of minutes. The puzzles start out simple and small, and become larger, more colorful, and more difficult as you progress. I really feel that it made me a better thinker and problem solver.<br /><br />I'm currently using the free version but I'll definitely buy more levels in the near future.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was just fabulous. I bought it months ago but thought it would be too difficult to get through because of the content. I was wrong! It was so uplifting! I loved this book! You will too!!!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Superb acting, timing, excellent use of flashback sequences. Very tight script, nothing wasted or extraneous.<br /><br />Befitting Smiley's character, Gary Oldman's performance largely conveys his emotions through subtle changes in expression, making his few moments of greater reaction the more powerful. Of course these moments are never in view of the other characters in the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch also gives an memorable performance.<br /><br />The movie conveys the sadness and isolation of the characters without ever using these words.<br /><br />Not for those seeking explosions or superheros -- not that there's anything wrong with that.<br /><br />Repays a second viewing.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|great movie.. ONE OF THE MOST FUN SCARY HORROR FILMS OUT THERE.. . . . . . . . .
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Compared to today's violence, zombie, blood dripping movies, this movie may be mild.  Although showing the cutting of ones throat doesn't make it mild for me.  It says it's 'based on a true story'.  We have no way to know what that story is. Or what's true about this one. The movie tries to rationalize it by showing an alleged picture of the real characters at the end of the move.<br />I thought one scene was funny however, where they pour the moonshine into the gas tank and the truck runs!<br />Wouldn't watch it twice...
B007B5EDEG|4.0|Once I picked the book I could not put it down, I am now on my third book, it is a very gory book but that is the era.

0446580848|1.0|I read some reviews and they seemed that DeMille had risen again after the last two. I was mistaken. I am 3/4 of the way done and nothing, I repeat nothing has happened. One review said the last 100 pages were good. If I had not invested the time already, I would have quit. I have been reading about one sentence a paragraph and I haven't missed anything. I used to look forward to him writing a book, but now he won't even be on my list to check out.<br /><br />I like the wit of Corey but after maybe 50 pages that wore thin and annoying.<br /><br />If you haven't read it, don't. You will hate yourself for spending the money and time. I just don't know how so many people can give it a 5 star and say it is suspenseful and thrilling. I think DeMille has gone the way of Suart Woods and a few of Baldacci's. I am having a tough time finding an author that keeps on ticking.

0743496736|5.0|This was my first read of one of Jodi Picoults' books and I was pleasantly surprised.<br />It was a gripping read and had me forcing my eyes to stay open at night,  just get a little further in the story.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fact that she touched a subject that is so very pertinent in this Day-and-age - Bullying - and that we should open to our eyes and realize that most of our society is being bullied in one way or another, whether it be at school, in the home or the workplace.<br /><br />It should not be tolerated - full-stop.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book so much that I have already gotten Book number two (that I have at home) of hers' on to my currently-reading Bookshelf and look forward to seeing how the next of her books (Salem Falls) turns out.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|wont open on kindle. i have this on my iphone and i agree with above. too expensive to really play. plus rocks spawn way too much on open spaces. poneyville is an open place. we should have that decorating freedom. not to mention it keeps loosing facebook connection and im not getting gifts because of this i think.
B005EGXTL2|1.0|I know this is a young adult book, and I'm not a young adult, so I understand that I can't expect it to be a great work of fiction. But... I loved the first book, thought the second was ok. And some young adult fiction is really great (eg Phillip Pullman, Susan Cooper). However, this book was a real disappointment.<br />The majority of the book is a description of the horrors of war, but there is no emotion to the narrative, and really I couldn't care less when the major characters were tortured and killed. It was so bad that I read most of the middle of the book quickly, thinking that there would be a major twist in the story and either the good parts of the bad parts would turn out to be part of a delusion of Katniss's (set up by writing the book in the first person, and the tracker jacker venom idea). But no such luck.<br />I have read a lot of dystopian scifi and clearly it is a fantastic genre to get out a message to young people that conflict is often not black and white, but in the end this book just leaves me cold.<br />Should have stopped after the first book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series is proving to be much better than 50 Shades trilogy. Has more &#34;meat&#34; to the story. I love the characters; they aren't perfect people, so it makes it more realistic. Wish we didn't have to wait so long for the next book.

1451695187|5.0|Dr. Alexander's description of his visit to the afterlife is vivid and colorful.  It makes you almost imagine that you are there as well.  This NDE experience, like many others I have read, has many things in common.  What is most exciting from a clinical perspective, is this writer is in one of the highest regarded medical catagories.  As a neurosurgeon, who beyond this status that can reliable refute what he has written about how this is REAL.  The facts he presents about his medical situation and how each possibility for cause are eliminated, are truly the amazing thing in this book!  Let the medical world be on notice, it is real....and no, it's not all statistics.  Holly Klein MSW, LSCSW

It didn't convince me of a loving god, as it promised in its beginning, but this brilliant work gave me the kind of laughter that only comes after a tragedy--the kind you never want to need, and the only kind that has the power to lighten a heavy heart.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Every year I eagerly await the Christmas album offerings, and this year I was rewarded with this album.  Usually I will listen to a new Christmas album for part of that season and then ditch it to go back to my all time favorites - A Charlie Brown Christmas, James Taylor's Christmas album, etc. - however this album is so good I have been obsessively listening to it.  You just can't beat Rod's raspy voice, and he doesn't try to \\"fancy\\" up the songs - one of my pet peeves, he simply lets his voice and the instruments shine.

1592402038|4.0|Louis Menand wrote a highly negative review of Lynne Truss's Eats, Shoots & Leaves for The New Yorker in June of 2004. I noticed the same problems as the reviewer, but I did not get quite as frustrated by them. Truss has no real direction; however, her argument is supported as consistently as one could hope with such a noncommittal thesis. She supplies humorous, easy-to-understand examples as she attempts to show that there is a middle ground any \\"stickler\\" for grammar can reach with their fellow sticklers, whether they be prescriptivist or descriptivist.<br /><br />Truss knows her audience. We have picked up her book to find someone to commiserate with. We may not completely understand grammar, but we love and respect it, and we hate to see it misused. Each chapter is devoted to a type of punctuation mark. Truss writes adoringly of each one, as if they are the superheroes in an alphabet world. The apostrophe is needed to keep order and understanding in the universe. The comma clears up possible misinterpretations. Colons and semi-colons are graceful and full of artistic potential. Italics, dashes and exclamation marks demand your attention. The hyphen is a humble helper. And her concluding chapter laments the decline of proper punctuation and print culture.<br /><br />Menand, on the other hand, is a proper grammarian. He spends a significant chunk of his review pointing out the technical flaws of Truss's book. A major problem the reviewer had was with the book's inconsistency. He complains: \\"Where you most expect punctuation, it may not show up at all.\\" Then again, sometimes Truss would over-punctuate. She acknowledges her own inconsistencies within the book. She explains that \\"one shouldn't be too rigid about the Oxford comma,\\" and almost tauntingly tells us we should have spotted a (grammatically unnecessary, but stylistically justified) Oxford comma somewhere in her writing. For Truss, there is an exception to almost every rule, which does not really equate to being a stickler.<br /><br />Part of the reason Eats, Shoots & Leaves is kind of a mess is because its author does not do a very good job of organizing her argument to distinguish between technical and aesthetic grammar. Menand detects this snag as well: \\"Truss has got things mixed up because she has confused two aspects of writing.\\" A solution could have been to stick to the technical aspects of proper punctuation, then included a list of exceptions at the end. Her book would have been much more successful if she had explicitly set out to prove one, the other, or both separately. However, her exceptions to rules are scattered; lack sound support tying back into the thesis; and sometimes omit any further explanation or depth other than a simple, \\"That's the way it is.\\"<br /><br />As a journalist, Menand obviously advocates more for the technical uses of punctuation. He argues that it is not the job of punctuation to add beauty or personal expression to a piece of writing. He believes that punctuation's \\"role is semantic: to add precision and complexity to meaning. It increases the information potential of strings of words.\\" I would disagree with him on this and say that Truss does a wonderful job of explaining just how much personal or artistic meaning punctuation may add to a sentence. She expertly describes the way some famous writers command their writing using their own punctuation style. Her best examples of this are in the chapter entitled \\"Airs and Graces,\\" about the semicolon and colon. When we see these marks, we can feel anticipation for what is coming next. We crave more information and we know we are about the get it. The way she describes this relatable feeling is a delight to true grammar lovers.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fascinating thing I came away with from this book is one very powerful example of the power of punctuation to shape behavior and ideology. For instance, take the comma placement in the following biblical passage: \\"Verily, I say untothee, This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise.\\" Change the punctuation around a bit and this changes into evidence of Purgatory: \\"Verily I say unto thee this day, Thou shalt be with me in Paradise.\\" This is a strong example of how punctuation influences interpretation and, in this case, changes the course of human history! How Truss found so many interesting details in the obscure history of English punctuation is truly amazing. She really seems to have done her research. Each chapter contains succinct, relevant tidbits about the history and evolution of our language's punctuation marks.<br /><br />Menand hardly acknowledges the well-researched historical aspect of Truss's book, and then turns it around into a negative: \\"In earlier times punctuation did a lot more work than it does today, and some of the work involved adjusting the timing in sentences. But this is no longer the norm, and trying to punctuate in that spirit now only makes for ambiguity and annoyance.\\" Our writer just can't win with this guy. I would turn his argument around and say that there is some beauty in punctuating intuitively. Just as a lover of biological evolution would never pass up the opportunity to play around with the Dodo bird, why should a writer pass up the chance to be in touch with a relic of their beloved language? The one complaint I have about the history in this book is that Truss goes on and on about the picture she found of the first printed semicolon, yet she does not share this picture with her readers.<br /><br />Truss advocates standing up for proper grammar whenever we see it mishandled in the streets. Yet, she mishandles it in her book. She allows concessions for the artistic expression of writers, yet not for the layman (oh, except for the greengrocer). Why is it okay for an artist to use a comma slice, but then not okay for a lowly shopkeeper to add apostrophes where none should be? Perhaps she feels you must know the rules before you are allowed to break them. That implies you must be a prescriptivist stickler before gaining permission to be a descriptivist. And so, of course,  lowly shopkeepers do not have the right even to be descriptivist.<br /><br />There are certain instances in which this book is a let-down for true grammar aficionados. In one of the few footnotes, Truss tells us that the correct comma placement for the statement \\"He shot, himself, as a child\\" is as written, as opposed to \\"He shot himself as a child.\\" I was disappointed that she did not elaborate on why one is more grammatical than the other. Frankly, glazing over this explanation left me doubting whether or not she herself understood. On the other hand, Menand seems to be quite the prescriptivist, and must resent the fact that Truss admits she is no grammarian. It is unfortunate that this knowledgeable reviewer - or someone like him -  was not consulted to fix some of this book's embarrassing punctuation mistakes.<br /><br />Menand points out that the publishers \\"elected not to make any changes for the American edition, a typesetting convenience that makes the book virtually useless for American readers.\\" I noticed this problem as well. Truss does make mention of a few differences between British and American English, which only served to peak my interest on the topic of how our two languages have and will diverge. I would have liked for her to have elaborated a bit further for her American audience. For the most part I was left feeling I would have gotten more out of her book if I were British.<br /><br />That being said, there are some things Truss chose to include in her book that were not really necessary and could have been omitted to make room for expansion of other concepts. Specifically, she goes into what I'll refer to as \\"alternative\\" punctuation. So, for instance, she suggests that a potential replacement for the apostrophe (`) could be a tilde (~). She also tells us that some advocate for the return of compound punctuation, such as commaswith dashes (, --) and semicolons with dashes (;--). Disappointingly, she does not delve any further into how these types of punctuation would improve any of today's difficulties. If anything, they would just overcomplicate a system that is naturally heading in the direction of simplification.<br /><br />Truss's treatment of the double possessive problem left me dissatisfied. I expected her to give a more definitive opinion on writing one way or the other and not allowing an exception to this rule. If the goal is to make grammar more understandable and intuitive, why not simplify rules where we find intrinsic inconsistencies and confusion? So, for instance, to say \\"a friend of Sally's\\" would be the same as saying \\"a friend of hers.\\" Yet, it is not proper to do this for inanimate objects. \\"A fan of the book's\\" or \\"a fan of its\\" are not correct. This distinction between animate and inanimate seems trivial and unnecessary.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, this grammar book had me laughing out loud, yet that is one appreciable aspect of Truss's writing that Menand did not seem to understand. The reviewer's mistake is in taking Truss too seriously. The New Yorker, understandably, means serious business. But the author is your typical quirky British lady, a la Bridget Jones. At one point Truss describes how seeing an improperly placed apostrophe incites violence and anger in her. Of course, she only means to make her audience laugh and establish some pathos with fellow sticklers. Menand seems oblivious to the idea that maybe Truss is just writing a light-hearted, accessible piece for normal, everyday grammar fans.<br /><br />Readers of this book may not come away with an instant recallable knowledge of grammar rules. It would take years of practice reading and writing with constant attention to the rules Truss presented in order for any typical reader to approach the prescriptivist heights Menand has set for himself.

B0049VVE7Y|4.0|I bought the bluray based on the Black Friday sale and the high ratings that the show received. I am glad that I made the purchase.  I thoroughly enjoyed the series.<br /><br />The zombies makeup are extremely well done. There were definitely no corners cut here on the special effect budget. There is also an engaging storyline along the required shoot em ups that one expects from the genre. I can't wait to get season 2. Horror picture fans will not be disappointed and even the casual horror picture fans may find the series engaging. Very well done indeed.
B009YX02T8|5.0|I have all the other albums so I wanted to complete the set.  They do a great job of capturing the mood of the movie everytime. And after I saw the movie and the music placement, I loved it even more. The Twilight Saga soundtracks have opened me up to new songs and bands I may not have found otherwise:)

B00A8ECU24|3.0|When Gameloft released the MLP app, there were mixed reactions, especially after they confirmed it would be a Sims-like game. Sadly, the reactions are partially true.<br /><br />The good:<br />1. Graphics are amazing<br />2. a lot to work for in the game in terms of unlocking stuff.<br />3. many &quot;Brony&quot; shoutouts are made<br /><br />The bad:<br />Social connectivity is required to earn one form of currency<br />Somewhat laggy on KF<br />sound options are glitchy (such as mute)<br /><br />The ugly:<br /> the need for IAP's becomes excessive after only a couple hours of playing (level 11, about), which is.frustrating.<br /><br />overall: Worth getting if you like games such as the Sims, but will take a lllooonnnggg time if you want to finish playing free.

B0034G4P4O|4.0|Tintin was my favorite growing up, I am a Uber nerd when it comes to the Herge Universe, so it was with a bit of hesitation I went to see this movie, the movie took pieces of the stories I know so well and put it together to a action filled movie, and I liked it, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock they were all there.<br /><br />I do however warn you if you are a Tintin fan, this movie chops everything up for you but without ruining the fun, it does not follow the story completely but it is close enough, worth a watch.
B0086700CM|4.0|some people say you cant even beat the first level... have they not heard of an endless game? there are no levels! and some people say its boring because it repeats itself. its not an adventure game. its not supposed to be different. the reason its fun is because the longer you play, the faster it gets, the faster you need to think. and you know you're getting better when you go farther than before on the same course. some people say we just rate it 5 stars because its a popular game and we're happy its out. ive had this game for months and i still think its a good game. some people say the pictures dont work. they aren't pictures, they're wallpaper. kindles cant have wallpaper. some people say its laggy. turn off your device for 5-10 minutes and try again... if you dont like the game, dont play it. but who are you to give negatively exaggerated ratings? &quot;if you dont have anything nice to say, dont say anything at all.&quot; -bambi

B009YU6FJM|5.0|As a fan that found the album Diamond Eyes a return-to-form after the self-titled release and the somewhat experimental Saturday Night Wrist; Koi No Yokan does not fail to please. Serving as a near-culmination of all their sounds the Deftones have  developed across all their material, this album excels in all areas, Chino Moreno's vocals have never been more spot-on or in tune with the feel of each song, Sergio Vega proves a formidable alternative to the unfortunately injured Chi Cheng on bass, choosing to flow with his own style of rhythm rather than simply \\"standing in\\" for Cheng. Abe Cunningham locks in tight in his known solid and now somewhat flashier drumming than previous titles. However, as a guitarist, I have to commend Stephen Carpenter for the seamless integration of the eight-string guitar fully into the band's sound, creating lush, deep chords juxtaposed with higher melodies, incorporating the entire instrument rather than simply hammering away on the lowest four strings in the fashion of many of the 'Djent' style bands currently releasing music these days. With Diamond Eyes now seeming like Steph's first flirtation with the eight string, in Koi No Yokan he demonstrates a mastery of the extended range and a thoughtful restraint that give the album an unprecedented depth. High points include 'Swerve City'; 'Poltergeist'; and 'Goon Sqauad', and while these tracks stand out, I am hard pressed to fin a low point anywhere on this particular record.

B005DI65L2|5.0|Several of the reviews mention that this is not a veterinary textbook on animal behavior. This is true, but that is what is wonderful about it. It is a good blend of science and the author's personal experiences. I have read many books on animal behavior, and found many new nuggets of information that helps me understand my dogs better, and aids in developing training strategies.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Loving this so far, have read 4 books (kind of out of order)  The books have romance and humor and I like that.  Sometimes the romance can get a bit too graphic for my tastes (makes my eye brows raise) but this was seems tame after some I have read.  I am really enjoying the extra humor of Bones in these books.
B002MEW7YY|3.0|When premiered, this production was important enough to warrant a review in the New York Review of the Books, by the venerable Daniel Mendelsohn issuing the most powerful vituperation towards it, especially denouncing the director for the poor taste, complete lack of understanding of the historical background, artistic insensitivity and so on.  The pounding uproar of Mendelsohn's wrath was such that it remained in memory, as not every day an opera production causes a similarly furious reaction.<br /><br />Thus I was curious to see it when by chance I came across this DVD.  First of all, I found the production rather quite conservative and lavish, very much in the Met's tradition.  There are very few liberties taken, and for those who want to see a true re-invention of the opera story, just about any recent German-speaking lands (German, Austrian, Zurich) production shall suffice.  I found this Met production quite beautiful, although not particularly striking.  In any case, it is not aesthetically offensive; it rather leaves one indifferent.<br /><br />The good things are, however, only a handful - first of all, the primadonna - La Netrebko is a fierce Lucia, a tigress as she is.  The scene of the duet with her brother shows her at her best dramatically  - fiery eyes, imposing posture.  Her voice is glorious, her vocal powers and controls are in excellent shape.  With her grandiose presence, she looks pushed into a role of a hysteriac in the mad scene, where she entangles herself with the bloody bridal veil.  Netrebko never seems to lose herself, and here in Lucia she would probably be better if she were allowed to act with premeditation, like she was in Evelino Pido's Anna Bolena.  It is perhaps due to her too strong personality of a very sane, wise and reasonable individual that she could not be a believable Lucia, or the acting was not tailored to suit her true character.  Yet her performance here is noteworthy.<br /><br />Enrico (Marius Kwiecien) is vicious enough and sings convincingly.<br /><br />Edgardo (Piotr Beczala) has an unsteady entrance and throughout the performance does not sound  terribly thrilling.  It seems that he rehearsed the best his final aria \\"Tu che a Dio spiegasti l'ali\\" which he sings with a pleasant squillo.  However in this production he is not an Edgardo who will make you feel any despair or experience any strong emotions at all.  In this quality he matches Anna Netrebko in this performance.<br /><br />The truly disappointing and even scary impressions come from the musical director Marco Armiliato.  Many times, especially in the beginning with Piotr Beczala the singer and the orchestra seem to be playing a catching-up game - either Beczala is too early or the orchestra is too late.  It happens so often and so noticeably that one wonders how can a house with inexhaustible resource make such a poor musical delivery.<br /><br />The sextet \\"Chi mi frena in tal momento?\\" (Act II, track 28) deserves a deathly thumb-down.  It is truly a musical fiasco and should be an embarrassment for the conductor.  I did not find a photographer taking away or adding anything; for that matter, no decorative trick was of any value at the moment.  The bottom-line of any opera performance is music,  and musical integrity was seriously violated in this highlight of the opera.<br /><br />One side comment for this scene, when the Edgardo bullies Lucia and condemns her publicly, is that it must have inspired Verdi for his Alfredo doing the same to Traviata, also in Act II.  But of course, that was a much better behaved French story, with a different outcome, as compared to wild Scots.<br /><br />Back to this Lucia -  it is another case of a typical Met production: expensive, elaborate, star-participating (Netrebko), but somehow the end result leaves the listener and the viewer nonchalant.  The ghosts employed to enliven the performance were amusing; the most curious was Lucia's own ghost (played by well-powedered Netrebko)who looks inquisitively at her lover and then makes the final push of the fateful dagger into his body.  This innovation must be inspired by another classic - ballet Giselle, with Lucia playing a vindictive blood-thirsting Willis, taking the life of a treacherous lover.  Yet the story is not totally convincing again - a romantic heroine, like Giselle, is supposed to save her beloved from any harm; the tradition supported by later creatures like Gilda or Senta.  Perhaps the idea was to turn Lucia into Judith, who kills unworthy lovers - first her unappealing husband, then a cruel lover.<br /><br />On the second thought, however, the idea has some merit - it should require a special skill of a woman to kill a man like she kills her husband;  anyone knows that in reality it is quite impossible for a female to kill a male with a knife without suffering any harm; this means she really killed him instantly, making a perfect hit.  The method of killing is concealed.  What did she do to Arturo?  Maybe she had castrated him, and he bled to death... I am sure such an interpretation is awaiting us soon in Berlin or Vienna, but the Met again was too shy.<br /><br />Yet this final reincarnation of Lucia as a double castrating murderess explains why an ephebe like Daniel Mendelsohn was horrified with the production. But it seems that the public cheered the idea of Lucia on the path of becoming a successful serial killer, invincible now since she's a ghost.<br /><br />Therefore this production might not be as bland and dull as initially seems.  I give it generous three stars for interesting hints and twists, in the Edgar Allen Poe style.  After all, Edgar Allen Poe could be considered a worthy heir to Sir Walter Scott.  Maybe this production should have announced itself as Ligeia de Lammermoor, although Judith gives the action more assuredness, culminating with success.who looks inquisitively at her lover and then makes the final push of the fateful dagger into his body.

0307887448|1.0|I'm about half-way through this book and I may not even bother finishing it. I also grew up a nerd in the 80s and I know nearly every reference in this book. But I find it tedious, boring and poorly written. The characters are one-dimensional, the info-dumping is simply excessive and who does he think needs all that info-dumping anyway? Who does the author imagine his audience is? For those of us who are nerds and geeks, we need no explanation. I would have enjoyed discovering the references without having each one pointed out to me. And if he writes \\"80s style \\" one more time I'm going to scream. WE KNOW ITS 80s STYLE! Just describe whatever it is and we will figure it out for ourselves. Burnt orange carpeting? Check. Wood paneling? Check. Big hair. Sure. We get it. Yawn.<br /><br />Neal Stephenson and Felicia Day (yes, even their early stuff) are light years ahead of what's in here. Read Snowcrash or go watch \\"Do You Wanna Date my Avatar\\" or \\"I'm the One That's Cool\\" on YouTube.<br /><br />I am honestly surprised at how much good press this novel got. I cannot recommend that anybody read it.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|So I was very hesitant to purchase this DVD because of all the negative reviews stating that the song \\"The Love Is Gone\\" wasn't on the DVD.  I honestly don't write reviews but I wanted to set the record straight.  I'm currently watching the DVD myself and clicked on extended version and indeed the song is there.  I haven't watched the theater version yet which I guess is widescreen but I feel all this negative reviews about one song being missing from one viewing when you can find the song in the extended version is not necessary.  Lets just enjoy the film and remember the meaning of it.

In my opinion no one plays sad-unhappy better than her, very Kate Winslet-ish!<br /><br />I think this movie is brilliant, clever and very gently and tastefully explores the angst one feels when they are not sure how they are suppose to be in situations. I found the Margot character extremely relatable, her desire to have what she \\"thinks\\" it's suppose to be.. is in my opinion very believable. The scene where she asks over their anniversary dinner \\"isn't it weird we are sitting here and eating without saying a word to each other\\" I thought is classic....no long term couple can not relate!<br /><br />PS. The hipster touch in fashion, home decorations, neighbourhood, lifestyle was magnificent! Felt like I was at home in Williamsburg Brooklyn!

0316226424|5.0|This is my favorite novel of the Twilight series, and it contains all of the most highly-anticipated moments: the wedding, honeymoon sex, and Bella's transformation into a vampire at last, plus an impossible event that will change everything...<br /> (By the way, why do people write bad reviews of this novel? Didn't they already decide they didn't like it after one of the previous three books? Then why bother reading the last one?)<br /><br /> ***Spoilers follow***<br />All of the attention to little, realistic details made this book a fantastic read. I loved the ridiculous bullet-proof car Edward buys for Bella so she doesn't suddenly die before she can marry him and become a vampire, as well as the sweet description of the wedding's special moments. The author allows for Bella to really \\"say goodbye\\" to her parents since it may be the last time she sees them while she's still human. The honeymoon is no less than perfect (on a private island off of the coast of Brazil), and even though Edward accidentally bruises Bella in the bedroom, we can understand that it was obviously worth it! When Bella discovers she's pregnant, the whole plot takes on an abrupt urgency.<br />  The implications of her pregnancy are vast:<br />1) No one knows exactly what she'll be giving birth to...<br />2) The baby grows exceptionally fast and is strong enough to seriously hurt her...<br />3) No one expects her to survive the baby's delivery...<br />4) Edward wants an abortion in order to save Bella.<br />5) Bella wants to keep the baby.<br />6) And finally...let's not forget that any child vampire found by the Volturi vampire mafia is executed.<br /><br /> When they return home from the honeymoon, Bella slowly gets weaker. Jacob discovers her pregnancy and is naturally furious - it made sense to see him ready to kill Edward once and for all, and the tensions between Edward and Jacob are higher than ever. While Bella clings to life as her \\"vampire-hybrid\\" child grows, the author shifts into Jacob's point of view to capture the conflicts amongst the werewolves about whether they should allow Bella's \\"newborn monster\\" to live. The Indian tribe splits into two opposing parties: one led by Jacob to defend Bella until the end, and the other led by Sam, waiting to kill the expected vampire child. Jacob and two of his companions take shifts circling the perimeter of the Cullen's home, until finally, the deadly labor begins.<br /><br /> The scenes of the bloody delivery, Bella's death and resurrection as a vampire, and Jacob's \\"imprinting\\" on the new child do not disappoint. From the birth until the final showdown with the Volturi vampire clan, you'll be kept hoping that the new family can survive the incredible odds against them.<br />  -Joy Sydney Williams (author)o Jacob's point of view to capture the conflicts amongst the werewolves about whether they should allow Bella's \\"newborn monster\\" to live.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I would go out on a limb and say that there are probably not many other directors who divide the viewing public more than Terrance Malick. His films are an art form, but often they are so immersed in the art form that the viewers may lose the film before it's done. Which is a disservice. Especially since the best way to appreciate this film is by taking a step back and looking at the whole picture.<br /><br />First I must comment on the blu-ray visuals. Fantastic. This is one of those films that shines. There is even a series of scenes starting with the big bang and progressing through evolution and into the 'present'. The scene could have been very disastrous. But somehow Malick makes this work.<br /><br />Music is of utmost importance. There are many great tracks, but of note is the use of Smetana's Moldau. It fits the film perfectly. But the classical score is so well matched to each scene that I can't imagine watching this film without the score.<br /><br />If you view the events of this film as an abstract of eastern philosophy, then it makes much more sense. Malick is putting forward the belief that all life is interconnected (hence Tree of Life). The other influence is more along the Biblical sense (kind of countering the Eastern philosophy). The premise is \\"Why do we suffer?\\" and in fact this is spoken aloud in the film.<br /><br />The only two points that warrant me giving this a 98 out of 100: There is a scene where Chastain is floating around as if in a vortex - it was jarring and I felt the scene could have been better if she was skipping around in the forest maybe lighter than air? The other point was in the latter 3/4 part of the film. I think Malick drew out the scenes with the boys a little too much - I mentioned it to my partner (hey, I'm kind of wanting to move on past the boys' scenes) and then it changed right after that.<br /><br />Sean Penn isn't in the film very much, so it's a little odd to see him get second top billing along with Pitt, but I guess his name carries weight. Brad Pitt though is phenomenal and deserves much credit for his role. Even the kids are pretty fantastic. The acting is mostly subtle and there isn't a ton of dialogue, much to the style of Malick.<br /><br />I loved the film and count it among the best films in recent years. It is as close to perfection as I have seen lately. It does require one to suspend many preconceptions about film in general, but if one is able to set aside these notions and enjoy the film as a work of art as a whole, then the viewer will be rewarded.<br /><br />And I highly recommend the Blu-Ray, it looks great! (And take note of the digital copy, as with most, it has an expiration date).I guess his name carries weight. Brad Pitt though is phenomenal and deserves much credit for his role. Even the kids are pretty fantastic. The acting is mostly subtle and there isn't a ton of dialogue, much to the style of Malick.<br /><br />I loved the film and count it among the best films in recent years. It is as close to perfection as I have seen lately. It does require one to suspend many preconceptions about film in general, but if one is able to set aside these notions and enjoy the film as a work of art as a whole, then the viewer will be rewarded.<br /><br />And I highly recommend the Blu-Ray, it looks great! (And take note of the digital copy, as with most, it has an expiration date).
B0070Y46UY|5.0|From divinity to doubt, back to divinity, Life of Pi is a surely spiritual experience. If ten stars were an option it wouldn't suffice.
B000FC1RCI|2.0|This book was probably a big hit in its day but it seems pretty cheesy.  My son needed to read it for his 8th grade English class.  There are much better books out there.  I am not quite sure why they picked this book.  The word &#34;queer&#34; is used quite often which would give these students a very low grade (if they were writing a paper) for repeating the same word not to mention it made them laugh every time they read the word.  At first, it is hard to keep track of who each character is.  It didn't hold my interest. Many people enjoy this type of writing, but based on this book, I would not read another one of her books.  I understand it had a original title different from this.  I didn't appreciate that and maybe it was acceptable during its time but it doesn't sit well with me.  Google it if you want to learn more.  Instead of ten little soldiers it was ten little Indians which was changed from ten little (not a word I would repeat).
B005LAIHY0|4.0|After viewing \\"Prometheus,\\" I left the theater disappointed and confused, yet thoughtful.<br />I was thankful for the high budget visuals (the beautifully shot opening sequence on primeval Earth and the Orrery scene were fantastic) and the intent of the story to at least AIM for something more substantial than the usual sci-fi fare. But the movie is impaired by trying to be too many things to too broad an audience and I think that makes it somewhat unsatisfying for most people, to some degree.<br /><br />Check out the discarded parts of Dan O'Bannon's original script and artwork (1975?) of \\"Alien\\" for many of \\"Prometheus`\\" ideas, if you've got \\"Anthology\\"( Blu-ray) or \\"Quadrilogy\\"(DVD).  O'Bannon's script had the pyramid (or silo [from Geiger], also used in \\"AVP\\" on Earth), canisters (instead of eggs) and squid-like facehugger.  Eggs were generated by 'cocooning' (see the cut scenes from \\"Alien,\\" re-introduced in the Director's cut).  Cameron created a continuity issue with his introduction of the `queen' into the alien's lifecycle in \\"Alien 2.\\"  In \\"Alien 3,\\" Fincher modified the `chestburster' phase of the alien's lifecycle, adding the `Bambi-Burster' (it gestated in the same way as the \\"Deacon\\" for the last gratuitous shot used in \\"Prometheus\\").  In summary, much of what happens in \\"Prometheus\\" has gone on before and what's left is the story of the `Space Jockeys,' which I've wondered about since'79.  It answers some of those questions but I guess I've still got to wait for the inevitable sequel(s).  I just cross my fingers that Ridley will still be around to direct it. He's getting up there.<br /><br />The Blu-ray clears up much of the confusion. It seems that many people don't have access to the deleted scenes or features that answer many questions and spell out much of what was going on; either thru the two commentary tracks in the main film, or the text and audio commentary provided for every deleted scene, plus the supplemental bonus features.  It convincedme to upgrade my 3 star rating.  Without the BD content, I'm afraid I'd downgrade it.  Yeah, it should have been up there on the screen in the first place; but was cut to reduce running time, improve pacing, or maintain the mystery (aka create the need for a sequel or Director's cut). It might have been a much better 150 minute movie.  As is, it functions best as just a blockbuster set-up for \\"Prometheus 2.\\"<br /><br />Let's hope next time that Scott delivers.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Very interesting movie from start to finish. I see it got mixed reviews but I loved it! Vintage DiCaprio & Scorsese (sp?)

1616614609|5.0|This game is an excellent two player game. I do recommend watching a youtube video of how to play the game because the directions of how to play can be misinterpreted easily.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This isn't out yet, but the movie was amazing!  If you love classic Tim Burton - you'll love this film.  One of the best I've seen all year.  I don't see any regular DVD only version available though.  I do not use or want a 3D version of the film. I can't stand 3D.  Also check out \\"ParaNorman\\" and \\"Wreck It Ralph\\".  All three were tops this year!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game because you feel like your in a real carnival. my dad works at a carnival yay
B005721W9O|5.0|Great movie. It covers with wit so many of the odd aspects and plot points that trekie and casual space adventure fans have shared that you are bound to find hilarity at each turn, but especially as Quest moves into high gear in the second half. Too many misadventures to mention... but, a few: the beaming up of a weird creature; the hall of slamming things; the mother's reply to her teenage son who explains why he is heading out with so many fireworks.<br /><br />I am over 70, have seen this movie at least 3 or 4 times and it never fails to please.
B007EECSFA|4.0|The book was interesting and the plot developed well.  Characters were well presented and the ending was an unexpected surprise
B009329ZF2|3.0|I have to be honest. I wasn't expecting much from this movie. When I heard it was about aliens.... I figured it would be just another flop, but I went ahead and watched it anyway. I was pleasently surprised. I was decent. I'd watch it more than once.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I actually started watching this by accident one night after work and have to say, it's pretty darn good. I don't know what it is about this version as opposed to other reiterations, but this one is my favorite. Well acted, the characters are relatable and you feel for the characters. Watch it!
B006HTUZ1C|1.0|definitely not my favorite game. it is very awkward to play and not much fun at all. dont get it

0671646788|5.0|This book is a must read for business owners. It's a book that shows the value of positive thinking, without all the new age hogwash of the law of attraction. The author shows how a positive attitude can make a difference in your business, work, and life, as well as how to implement positive thinking into your day. Following his suggestions has helped my business and overall sense of well-being and this is a book I will read again and again because the lessons it offers provides new perspectives every time you read it. If you don't have this book, pick it up and read it as soon as possible. You'll see a difference in your life and business right away.
030759565X|2.0|I feel terrible writing this review, but i have to.  I was so looking forward to receiving the Smitten Kitchen cookbook.  I have made several recipes from the website and really enjoyed em, but the cookbook doesn't work for me... the recipes are somewhat odd and time consuming... this coming from an avid cook.  However, i am picky about my cookbooks because if i'm going to give up coveted shelf space in my kitchen the book needs to be amazing... Like Ina Garten amazing:) However, the author seems super sweet and writes lovely, but sorry to say... I'd pass on purchasing the cookbook... stick to her website.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|Amazon instant has made it possible for me to catch up on episodes I missed in this series at anytime. You don't know how valuable this is for me. I get to watch the Walking Dead when it is convenient for me. (that also means I can watch from my iPad with the lights on anywhere that won't terrify me!) I am enjoying the shows character progression. It is rich and authentic. When a character makes a descent into craziness, you believe it! Oh by the way, save yourself some heartache and don't fall in love with any of the characters: No one is safe! It is the zombie apocalypse after all.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Easy to learn. Most games are fast and fun. A few can be frustrating. Good variety. Point system to unlock new games my  only complaint as I had to replay many games to aquire enough to unlock new games. Overall I would recomend downloading thia app.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am an adult who enjoys YA reading. I enjoy this type of book because it is not confined to pre-set adult expectations about what reality can or should be.  It draws conclusions about what life would be like in a dystopian society and then allows you to live that experience through others. Very enjoyable read.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has more features and functions.  Plus, a satellite view with actual imagery.  I find that extremely helpful when wanting to know where the weather (storms) are located in comparison to where I am located.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I hate books that revolve around a deux a machine to resolve the stories plot. I wanted to finish this journey with these characters and I wasn't looking for a classic happy ending or all the loose ends to be tied. But let's just say, there was some interesting character development in this last installment. Perhaps you will agree with the character arcs, I just didn't.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Breathtaking as usual, G.R.R. Martin still uses its magic pen.  The reader is always  surprised with new jumps in the intrigue.  The Seven know  how will the sixth book end... I don't.
B0051QJ83S|5.0|There are so many gems on this CD. Judas, Bloody Mary, Marry the Night, to name but a few. Some of the songs do feel more experimental in nature, but I am okay with that. Overall, the entire package is a sold work and a great value for the number of hits it includes. A must have for your GAGA collection.
B005NFW0U0|3.0|I'm not sure that I'll be watching the next season.  The series is too much like a vampire soap opera.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Read this book after watching the film. I think it was pretty faithful to the source material. I read a later version that actually made me think this one was edited for content. Not much differences just slight one. Great read, it really immerses you in this dystopian future world.
B005PK553C|5.0|If you are a fan of creepy shows and like to be freaked out, this is a series for you!
B008M0NDOK|5.0|My 10 year old and 12 year old can't put it down. Excellent accessory for the iPad.<br />Highly recommend this for anyone who plays games on the iPad.
B008VBYN80|4.0|this has been entertaining so far. my biggest complaint is my son accidentally uninstalled my game and after spending all day on it, I couldn't get it back and had to start over. I was even logged in with a gameloft Acct. and facebook. I like that you actually get to battle people in this game makes it unique. a solid 4 stars.

B005R32L66|5.0|Internet based telephone calling is a basic need for someone like me that travels throughout the world. The outrageous cell charges to use my cell phone is a thing of the past. All I need is a WiFi connection. Virtually all hotels offer free WiFi plus there are lots of internet cafes so I can keep connected for little or no cost to me. Not only that I can do video calling.
B00284BMBM|5.0|Everything I expected and hoped for after hearing a few of their songs on youtube. I was happy to purchase all 3 of Daughtry's albums that were out at the time, and this fit into my CD collection well.

B000050FEN|5.0|Enjoy this movie very much. This DVD does a good job of presenting what went into it while keeping some mystery.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Downloaded this app to a tablet I bought my Grandson for Christmas. When I try to launch the app will act like its loading then go back to the home screen. May be a fun game if I could get it to work.
B0013BCWEW|5.0|This true crime story has always been a fascinating one and David Fincher does a great job presenting it here. My personal favorite of the features is commentary by James Ellroy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|the book starts of well but then gets disappointing as the story unfolds.Its messed up and a on tim easy read.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I loved these books. I read the trilogy while on a summer holiday and could barely put them down. The characters are all very interesting and well developed. The storyline takes exciting twists and turns. Overall a fun read for men and women.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It actually gets 5 stars for the challenge it gives to your skepticism and intellectual world...4.5 stars for the writing style.
B0086700CM|3.0|temple run is an ideal  motive to street surfer it is a fast paced game fun for all ages in a day I waist &frac34; of my battery life playing temple run I absoloutley adore it I'm a nine year -old and I can garuntee it's. fun for all ages.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|With Neesom and trailers I had seen for this movie, thought it would be another \\"Taken\\". BUT most happy to say that this ever so much better than Taken. Unknown actually has a plot, mystery and every time you think you have a handle on it, can explain it, it twists and turns again. Well paced. Recommend.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Ever since I downloaded this game my nephew has taken over my kindle. I have to put a time limit on him because I want to read my kindle fire hd.

B005EWDA9M|4.0|It probably makes sense to read the third volume before writing a review, but I felt the need to pen down my thoughts before I lose them in the interim. Anyway, whether out of sheer marketing considerations, or Murakami's (and his translators') conscious attempt to create a kind of cliffhanger before the third volume, the first two books are self-contained in the way they trace the trajectory of the paths of the two protagonists Aomame and Tengo, which come so close to colliding, but not just yet.<br /><br />At the heart of the story, \\"1Q84\\" stands for the alternate universe of 1984, and how it comes to being is seamlessly dealt with by the cool, clean narrative style of the author, so much so, that when the clues dropped throughout the story begin to fit the pattern of the world of 1Q84, the reader is lulled into accepting the logic of the switch - which speaks of Murakami's level of ease with the magic realism genre. Kudos must be given (again) to Jay Rubin for distilling the essence of Murakami's Japanese prose, so that the minute and methodical attention to seemingly mundane tasks like preparing a meal, or a song and its writer's background, is never seen as superfluous, but rather as essential to the world Murakami has created. Of course, there is also the attention to his characters that give a certain gravitas to them, for example, the way Aomame can disarrange her features into an alarmingly ugly scowl, and her uneven ears (and lopsided breasts - perhaps a part of the female anatomy that features prominently in the author's consciousness?), on an otherwise attractive if cold demeanor.<br /><br />Without giving the plot away too much, it is safe to peg this as a story about life imitating art, and the power of words in creating worlds which blurs fact and fiction. It is testament to the persuasiveness of Murakami's story that this reader finds himself wondering about the Little People and Air Chrysalises after putting the book down.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game.  I've seen lots of people play and I thought I would play to and prediction. was right amazing!
B007YOC4RW|4.0|Very good variety of blues-rock tunes, much of the music is more blues inspired rock than pure blues, but he can wail the blues, both with his vocals and, of course his guitar and proves once again he is one of the best guitarists around these days. Joe delivers solid blues on the Willie Dixon song, and interprets other legends; Robert Johnson and Howlin Wolf and mixes in some of his own compositions.  From the first notes of the organ on Dislocated Boy I was hooked, if you're a fan of Joe, you need this one for your collection.
B000VOC90Y|4.0|I always wanted to buy a branded backpack like Swisgear Wenger. No need to say about the quality of this product. Packing from amazon was very good and shipping was also fast compare to other ones.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|I bought this off amazon because we had acquired the Patrick and then later sponge bob beanie. So we bought Gary to complete the set. It looks just like the picture and was everything I expected.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This movie is not really that great for adults, but it is good for kids. My son loves it. He loves the aliens and his favorite alien is the speedy alien \\"dog\\" that befriends John Carter. I think it is good for kids because it is visually very beautiful to look at and my son does not mind weak writing and poor story. I think most people know what a bomb it was but it can be fun for children.
B004ZN9OTG|3.0|I had known of Atom Heart Mother for 30 years & think I had heard it once. It is a non-significant & sometimes silly album that Pink Floyd released in 1970.  The band had not left Barrett's influence completely (even though he had been out of the band for a few years already) with groovy, hippy-style songs like \\"If\\" & \\"Summer '68\\" reminiscent of Piper at the Gates of Dawn. These songs are woven in with experimental Psychedelic work that seems trite by today's standards. All in all, the band was working its way to Meddle, then Dark Side where they really discovered themselves.<br /><br />I wish there was another standard of rating other than 3/5 stars. It is certainly not required to own as far as classic albums go. It is very well recorded (the remastered version is impeccable) and there is no question of the musicianship, yet it does not fit in today's categories. I think we have out grown what it was tying to say.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|Great insight into adoption of children from another country and relationships of families and the customs  of people with  different backgrounds.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Great story.<br /><br />Great special effects.<br /><br />Timeless classic.<br /><br />Pounding Rock n Roll soundtrack highlighting &#34;Cry Little Sister&#34; as the theme song.<br /><br />If you are a fan of vampire lore... you have to have this one in your collection.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Kristen is not acting just showing facetime, the film is disconnected from the original story which is fine to some extent but their own storyline is not making sense. You can watch this and get some work than at the same time, not really worth paying attention for a long time. Definitely not worth for a movie night.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|This movie sucks!...  The first one was great.  The second one was okay.  I can just hear the writers....\\"What can we do for the 3rd iteration to milk more money out of the folks who liked the first 2 movies...I know, let's have Will Smith get stopped by red neck cops in New York State while he is driving a 1969 \\"Caddy-Lac\\" convertible and have him say that he plays ball for the \\"New York Darkies.\\"  What a laugh. I slay myself...now where is my money?<br /><br />This movie was nothing but a pay check for the actors and steady work for the union employees of the studio.  There is a reason it went striaght to Amazon Instant Video.<br /><br />Give it a rest Will...you ain't funny if the writers don't write something funny for you to say.  Throwing in race on such a pissant script is a substitute for talented writing.  It appears that if the minimun hourly wage writers don't have enough talent to write a proper script they always strive to get a laugh by having a young, high-speed black guy demonstrate his moral superiority by saying something cute to reflect how ignorant the White cops are.  Har har har!!!  What a laugh.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Action, action, and more action!  This film is equal to or maybe better than the original.  The stunts Tom Cruise pulls off are breathtaking, terrifying, edge of your seat awesome!  The visuals in this movie are just outstanding.  I am not an action film buff, but I used to watch the MI series as a kid, so I was willing to give this a try.  Since this was the 4th installment, I wasn't expecting much, but I was wonderfully surprised.  Kudos to the editor for making the scenes sharp and keeping the tension high.  I highly recommend MI4 Ghost Protocol, and I hope you enjoy it too!
1590171993|4.0|Stoner is a literary and tragic novel reminiscent of Thomas Hardy if Hardy had set his novels in the American mid-west of the early 20th century. William Stoner, born on a hard scrabble family farm in Missouri changes the direction of his life after being inspired by a literature professor at the University of Missouri. As his story unfolds all the things that he holds out initially as ideals both professionally and personally seem to conspire together to disappoint him. Career rivalries, loveless marriage, estranged child, exiled lover all impact his outer word but Stoner has a stoic quality that allows him to navigate these and other difficulties and as he ages and they mount he seemingly detaches himself from external circumstances. Early in the novel as a young student he forms what may be the most meaningful relationships of his life with two fellow students and these sustain him as the novel progresses. John Williams wrote brilliantly and the language and pace of the novel subtly draws the reader into this man's life in a most compelling way. Stoner will stay with you for some time. it is a deep and very moving read.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You will not find a show of this greatness on the major networks. Each show pulls you in and by the by the nail biting end leaves you wanting more. Although it has zombies, it is more about the story lines of the people dealing with what their world has become.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|App crashes during the initial story set up screen (on transition between the second and third screen). Graphics so far as I could see weren't great on the larger HD screen either.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|The fact that this a true movie and Michael Orr is now playing for my hometown team makes this doubly relevant. Sandra Bullock is very good in this movie, but the movie carries itself despite her star power. It's a great family movie.
B0068LYEHA|1.0|I bought this because I heard some good things about it.  But I just didn't get it.  I found it to be vulgar and unreadable.  Wish I would have gotten it from the library instead and saved myself some money.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Started out a little slow.  I should have keep a sheet of paper to identify the characters as the story progressed!

0061689246|5.0|Neil Gaiman is a great fantasy Author and I feel really comes to the fore with this book. I have to admit, he really won me over with this one as I was wan't a massive fan of [[ASIN:0694525499 American Gods]] - although the critics loved it! If you would like more whimsy and an entertaining read, then you should certainly try [[ASIN:0861404211 The First Discworld Novels: The Colour of Magic and The Light Fantastic]] by Terry Pratchett. If however you would like a great adventure but less of the funny then try [[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]] by the little known but excellent J. Alastair Nash.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Definitely get it, worth the expense for sure. Extended cord for distanted gameplay, quite the experience! Get it, you won't regret it.
0140386335|5.0|This book is often overlooked owing to the 1984 film, but you should try to read this whether or not you have seen it. It has everything you could ask for in and fantasy story and I only hope the author got the recognition he so deserves. However, I expect he got a earned a lot of money from the film - which was and is still great! If you like this or want to consider other classics then try [[ASIN:0345253485 The Lord of the Rings,]] (a great movie now), [[ASIN:B0052N0GQ8 The Hobbit]] (soon to be a great film - I hope!) or [[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]] whihc they should make into a film!
B00973902K|5.0|Dthis is just like the radio version.  Love to sing along and work while listening to the music.  Both thumbs up.
0060557818|5.0|I remember the TV series of this from when I was a lot younger. It does look dated now, but the book holds up to the test of time. Gaiman really captures the feel of London and how you can go unseen by it's many eyes. This is a notion he extends upon by creating a whole fantasy world that's unseen by the normal person unless they know the right place to look. Other Fantasy novels I've also enjoyed, although not linked and very different, are [[ASIN:0345459407 Perdido Street Station]] and [[ASIN:B009KVBC20 Into The Trees]].
B008FSCNTK|3.0|i have liked diana krall...her voice...and her approach to album selections from \\"peel me a grape\\"...i thought her new album to be an easy choice...but this is a different and difficult album...a new direction...it seems \\"old\\" beyond her ususal years...and the songs are all kind of from the same mold...moody...i guess i didn't know what a glad rag doll would or should be...
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 12 & 9 year old constantly play this game. I had to buy another Kindle because they fight over it to play this game. We would highly recommend it.
0316069434|5.0|I have read all Michael Connelly's books and I am not disappointed in this, his latest one.  Keeps you on edge throughout as he slowly, but solidly builds Harry's case.  The end was a bit over the top, but hey, write twenty-five books and make them all great you probably have to get a little weird so they don't all end the same :-).  I thoroughly enjoyed it and finished in in two nights.  I hope Harry has more cases - seems to have been set up for more and his half brother gets his Lincoln out again soon.  Keep writing Michael...you still have it.<br /><br />Incidentally,  I love reading on my new kindle paperwhite, with just enough juice to get through the whole book before recharging, I may never purchase a hard cover book again.
B005HSL626|5.0|Held my 9 year old's attention throughout an appointment I had. No more I'm bored, I:m bored while waiting at the dentist office...
B000W9DSVW|4.0|4 stars because I like the movies and because I bought them at a great discount. If you are looking for blue-ray quality, don't buy this set at full price. They are DVD quality.<br /><br />I had already seen Ocean's 11 and 12. I like them both. Ocean's 11 is enigmatic and just smooth. Ocean's 12 is similar but there's more emphasis on romance, so not quite the boy's club the first one was. Ocean's 13 was entertaining but it lacked the element of surprise. Still, as a fan, it was enjoyable. Also, all three movies showcase great music. I'll be looking for those tracks next.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me wanting more. I could not put it down. It is a real love story that makes you want to know what adventure Anastasia & Christian will take next. It allows you to escape from your everyday life for awhile and draws you into their life. It is erotic, passionate, romantic & maddening all at the same time.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|The acting is first  rate.  Having lived through this part of the 20th century, I can say it is very accurate in portraying the life of a woman in the business world and the role of the at home wife. Sometimes it is actually painful to watch. The characters continue to reveal complexities that are both intriguing and depressing.  Nobody is happy!  Worth sticking with just to appreciate how far we've all come.
145551389X|5.0|I absolutely love the book and the beautiful pictures inside. photographe who took the pictures is so very talented they are absolutely beautiful.  I love the quality of the book

B007HACDLK|5.0|A great page turner. First Vince Flynn book I have read. Took up a recommendation by Bill O'Reilly of The Factor. Have since bought two more in the Mitch Rapp series. Enjoy them all.
1419703692|5.0|I ordered this for a friend of mines who is a batman fanatic. He loves this book and the story that goes along with it.
B009GEPSDK|3.0|Its one of those movies where you expected it to be so good because Jessica and the storyline, but ended up a tad disappointed when I watched it.  For those interested that have a Netflix account, it became available on Netflix a couple of days after I watched this movie and was disappointed I had to pay full pop.
0316227706|5.0|Underwater Dogs is a fabulous photography book full of pictures of, yes you guessed it, underwater dogs! The photos range from cute to hilarious to downright absurd but one thing that is completely obvious its that these dogs are loving every minute of their photo shoots. I swear in most of the photos you can actually see the smiles on their faces.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that is perfect to flick through when you're having a bad day and you want something to cheer you up. It definitely has a place on my keeper shelf and I know it's one I'll be going back to time and time again. Our family dog when I was growing up loved nothing more than swimming, I just wish that we'd had the idea to invest in an underwater camera - Seth Casteel you are a genius. What I really want to know is if he is planning a second book called Underwater Cats because I'd pay a fortune for a copy of that one!<br /><br />Every single visitor to my house this week has picked this book up from the coffee table and laughed out loud while they flicked through it, even the ones who aren't particularly keen on dogs. Underwater Dogs is a perfect gift for any dog lover this Christmas and if my review hasn't convinced you that this is a book you need to have in your life then perhaps the pictures in the Amazon \\"look inside\\" feature will. Who could resist those cute (if slightly manic and occasionally terrifying!) faces? This really is a must read book!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I had been waiting so long to see this movie, and when I watched it, I was not disappointed.  Good cast, effects and it kept me interested.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is fun, but the use of it is?  so, so, so, so, so, so, get it if you want to wast your time.
B007V65R54|4.0|I bought it for the name, but the breath and sweep of this is amazing.  A few minor editing errors in the first part of the kindle version really irritated, but the writing is very well done.  I enjoyed this look at the offbeat statistics profession
B00A77II0U|4.0|the game was enjoyable. it was a little glitchy after the orphanage. i have no major complaints other than that.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|WOW, A MUST HAVE,  the best move iv seen in years,  it kept me on the edje of my seat for the hole move.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|After watching this movie i was, well... in love! Now poto (phantom of the opera) is all i can listen to. Sierra and Ramin completely stole my heart on this production, every time i watch it i fall in love all over again and melt from Andrew's music. I dont want to spoil anything but i would have given anything to watch the ending in person <3 THANKYOU ANDREW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004SBX112|2.0|Almost every app I've every bought from Amazon that also is on Play, never gets the updates when Play does. There is a new uplooksdate yet again today, 12-1-12 and yet still I still don't even have the Halloween update from 10-24-12.<br /><br />Unless a game is ONLY on Amazon, don't buy from it from here. Unless it is free app of the day of a paid app, spend your money in Play.<br /><br />I got Jetpack Joyride cause it was only in here, then 2 weeks later it appeared in Play also. Waiting when something seems exclusive here is probably your safest bet.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I very rarely read for pleasure and when I do, its usually nonfiction books about history or the military.  I spend a fair amount of time playing video games, mostly of a futuristic genre.  So, I thought a book about war in the future would be a good fit.  This is a great work of science fiction and a truly enjoyable read.  I don't want to provide details of the book as others have done, but I would like to address one complaint that I thought actually added to the story.  A few other reviewers expressed disappointment regarding the \\"wisecracking\\" during the dialogue.  I think readers may picture 75 year olds of TODAY, but this takes place far into the future.  I could see myself making similar jokes even when I turn 75 (28 now).  Maybe that's why I enjoyed the book so much as I could relate to the dialogue and interactions among friends.  I finished the book in about two weeks (a record for me) and I've already purchased another book by Mr. Scalzi.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Love it. Addictive. Bought 3 more as presents for the holidays. Sometimes the ball gets stuck and you think it won't move, but just bang it in the right directions and you'll get it free.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love how easy to use and all my pins are easy to get to. Also like better then on regular computer.
B000UBLPU8|4.0|I have been immersing myself in (mostly) solo piano for the past year.  I had to stop with this recording and listen multiple times - I probably haven't &#34;heard&#34; it yet.<br /><br />You can read more scholarly reviews elsewhere - I'm not the expert.<br /><br />But here is a high recommendation: a 30-something co-worker came  into my office while I was playing this and said, &#34;Wow, what is that?&#34;.  He got a copy (his first jazz recording) and is hooked.  In my book, 'nuff said.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham keeps you turning the pages.  I forgot how much I enjoyed his writing till I started reading The Racketeer.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It seemed it was written by a teenager or young adult. However, I am hoping the next book is better. Intriguing story.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I don't mind dumping 20 dollars on these films because ever since I seen Batman Begins in the theatre I have never missed a release for this Trilogy I can't rate one of the films higher than another they all are one big story to me getting my copy delivered on Tuesday money well spent.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My grandson who turned 3 this week loves WALL-E.  Unfortunately, he broke the DVD at my daughter's home.  I was very happy to be able to replace it via my purchase through Amazon.com.
B001CTGQBK|4.0|Great movie. A classic film . Great acting. Entertaining movie with great music. Will watch it again.<br />John travolta and Olivia are great
B004DLPXAO|5.0|this app has allowed me to purchase and read many books that I would have had to purchase and store.  I would recommend using this app.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|Like many other reviewers here, I just love listening to Leonard Cohen. He is a great story teller, a clever yet humble poet who captivates your imaginagion and provides for your own, personal interpretaion of his lyrics.<br /><br />Although a lot of people consider him to be 'depressing', I find him highly uplifting and his lyrics fascinating, with some down-to-earth yet sophisticated element to them.<br /><br />Not all of his songs are great - some are so-so, some are disappointing, some are quite good - for an artist who produced such an amount of work over a long period of time, that is expected. Yet, at his best he manages to produce lyrics which touch your heart and soul and stay with you. His best songs also change/evolve with you - you can discover new meanings, new contexts, fresh outlooks and emotions each and every time you listen to them. This what makes him so special and admirable.<br /><br />The Stranger Song, for example, can provoke different emotions and different interpretations for different people. It is a simple story at first, yet complex and full of ambiguity really. It contains a few stories within the one song.<br /><br />'Suzanne' and 'The Sisters of Mercy' have soothing properties, along with some very strong, ambigual lines which are almost hidden in between.<br /><br />For those who find LC's voice a bit too difficult to listen to, try listening to Jeniffer W who has an album with 'First we Take Manhattan', 'Joan of Arc', 'Famous Blue Raincoat' etc.
B007SGM084|5.0|Not at all what I was expecting based on feedback I heard about the book.  I thought it was tastefully written.
B008S80OU2|4.0|Thrilled to finally have a really extensive boxed collection of my favorite band of all time!Saw them for the first time in 1973 when they played two shows for a SDPD food drive. Admission was a can of food and Daddy Warbucks(who morphed into 'Angel') opened the show. Love this set but...It sounds like a 1/10 of a second of the opening notes of each cd's first song has been cut off. These cd's just don't sound right as they begin. I started listening to these guys 40 years ago. Somethin' ain't right with the way these were remastered. Anyone else notice this?
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Not terribly dissimilar from other behaviorist theory but relayed in a compelling series of anecdotal narratives that provided some thought provocation.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I watched this film because I like those survival/end of the world type flicks. Most of the films in the genre are kind of terrible, but I watch them sometimes just because I like that sort of thing. The Grey is strong for the type, for sure.<br /><br />Liam Neeson is awesome in this. His character is plausibly thoughtful, more because of his interpretation than the writing itself. I always liked Neeson, but his \\"tough guys\\" always seemed to be slightly undermined by some undercurrent of bookishness in his personality. In The Grey he found a credible balance that he usually misses, and that was fun to watch.<br /><br />It's absolutely true that some of the plot turns were nonsensical. The wolves didn't exactly act like wolves (more like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park). The people didn't exactly act like people (sure, I'll jump 50 feet across a canyon into a tree for no apparent reason). In the end though, they were both close enough. The film was pretty entertaining and much more thoughtful than I expected it to be.<br /><br />A little willing suspension of disbelief goes a long way.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It has function and form to convert my tablet to a highly effective e-reader.  I would recommend this app to anyone like myself who reads on the go and can sometimes be separated from my kindle
B009A9BEHU|5.0|I'm a big Coldplay fan and this DVD is everything I expected and more.<br /><br />The menu animations are the best I've seen so far. The mix of live performances and behind the scenes / interviews is great.<br /><br /> I wish they would have included more footage about the creation of all the graffiti painted instruments and the Mylo Xyloto concepts in general.<br /><br /> This DVD made me revive the magical experience that was being part of one of the Mylo Xyloto concerts. I still have my xylobands and I recommend turning them on when you watch this DVD. A must have for every Coldplayer.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am happy with the free app.  My granddaughter enjoys this game a great deal.  The advertising between levels is bothersome but to get the app for free it seems like a decent tradeoff
0375869026|5.0|Rj Palacio has literally raised the bar and written a book that will never be able to be topped.  She has done a public service writing this book. I am not exaggerating.<br /><br />I was choking by the time I got to the end trying to hold in a flow of tears as to not wake up the child and freak her out seeing my tears.<br /><br />I saw Twitter going nuts over this book for awhile. (#Wonderofwonder) and thought \\"hmm adding that to my list\\" Well then I forgot about it. Until it caught my eye in the store not long ago.<br /><br />I love this book.  Love love, can't stress it enough kind of love.<br /><br />Growing up being different and knowing a lot of others that were \\"different\\" I can honestly say that the author absolutely nailed it when she was writing this book.<br />Auggie is exactly how you would expect a child that's grown up with his health issues to be.<br /><br />I loved Auggie he was absolutely adorable.  I loved the way he really grew into himself through the year and how much he over came.<br /><br />I really just wanted to give him and his entire family a great big hug.<br /><br />Auggie was definitely my favourite character, but really they were all amazing.  Via seems like she could have her own book, there is just something about her.<br /><br />This book should be mandatory reading for all middle school students, not to mention the rest of the planet.<br /><br />Buy this book, in fact buy two and pass it on.  Trust me by the time your finished you will be glad you did.<br /><br />Definitely a non forgettable book, with a great cast of characters.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is much better than Little Piano.  The music choices are more varied and it really gives your eyes a good workout.  It actually sounds like you have been playing music for a long time.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This Blu-ray has a lot of great extras plus it comes with a DVD version of the movie!! Very glad I got it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'm a big fan of the series so obviously I was waiting anxiously for this book to come out.  I really thought Riordan did a good job of blending all the demigods together.  He went from having to write for 3 characters to 6 and he did so very well.  I won't give a detailed analysis of the book but if you liked the earlier books then you are going to enjoy this book.  Just like the previous books I can't wait for the next one to come out
B007STBUIW|5.0|Saw this movie in the theater when it came out and I can honestly say I love this version. The extras on the Blu-ray are worth getting alone. A must buy!!!!
B004SBBDB2|5.0|I bought this so I could play movies from my iPhone and iPad onto my tv.  It was very quick and easy.  The picture is pretty good too.  The only drawback is that it only plays video.  I don't get the back ground screen of my iphone on the tv when its plugged in.  Still a very reasonable price for what it does.  I'd make the purchase again
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Very faithful to the graphic novel,the voice acting is spot on plus all the great extras on the Blu-ray makes this a must have for any Batman fan. Can't wait for part 2!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|It really is that addictive.  I thought regular solitaire was fun, but this is so much better.  And with several decks of cards.
B000067QMD|5.0|Use these for breast milk storage in my Avent bottles. Saves me money because I don't have to buy as many breast milk storage bags. I wish I had the space and money to only use bottles because these don't leak and I have had no problem with them not sealing properly in the freezer.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson's best work to date.  Willis, Norton, Murray, McDormand, Swinton and Keitel...a great cast and a wonderful story!  Add this to your collection!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this on a lightening deal and boy was it worth it. My son watches this movie constantly and I had no trouble playing it in his almost ancient dvd player
B00914JWSW|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a friend who is a BIG fan.  She loved it and anything buy this artist is very good.
B0095T3H2U|2.0|Not a bad movie but better decisions about cutting the redundant pieces of the film. Actors worked well together but pushing it with the same humor and carrying storyline for so long. It is supposed to be a romantic comedy.
B0055SWM08|5.0|hey I usually don't make reviews but this is a good game take my word for it. there was this one guy who said it glitched out on his kindle fire but I have a kindle and it works great. over all it is a fun game and I would pay a buck for it.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Should expect more from the writing and editing. Acting is fine but so many loose ends and improper use of quality actors.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|I think I'm a smart person, but this app has so many screens and options, it took about an hour of fiddling around with it before it 'clicked' and all made sense.  Now I truly appreciate what it has to offer.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great book. Kept my interest the in tire time. Great writing and very realistic story plot. I've read at least 5 books from this author and this might be the best yet.

B008GJV2OA|5.0|This movie is absolutely a classic with so many great scenes and one-liners it will have you laughing throughout the film.<br /><br />The film script was somewhat based on the a cold war novel, the thriller &#34;Red Alert&#34; but while writing the script  Kubrick decided it must be a black comedy.<br /><br />Utterly brilliant film; deserves repeated viewings.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This sounds cliche, but you often do get what you pay for, and at the price this sells for, you can't really expect much. I still have this bag but stopped using it for carrying expensive gear after I was at a shoot one day and placed the bag at a slight angle. The side gave way and allowed one my lenses to roll out on the sidewalk. Fortunately, the lens wasn't damaged, but it was definitely a wake-up call for me. I realize I should have kept the bag completely zipped, but I don't feel the sides should be so weak either, especially for something that is potentially carrying thousands of dollars worth of gear. The bag is okay overall but the real problem are the sides, especially when unzipped. They are not reinforced or sturdy at all, so you are definitely taking some risks using it. If you compare this bag to others like a Lowepro or even a Tenba, there is a clear difference in how strong the side walls are. I still use this bag for audio equipment, but no longer use it for any expensive gear.
B002YCVWXQ|4.0|The humor is very dark, even more so than other Tarantino films so not everyone's cup of tea but for the rest of us this is a great film and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of his other work.<br /><br /> I especially like Christoph Waltz  and would love to see him in more films.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Especially enjoy her duet with Michael Crawford - the one and only Phantom!  Beautiful selection of songs to easy listening.
159420411X|5.0|Scientific method meets practical application and common sense. Something every 20 year year aspiring to use his mind for anything useful should read.<br />Great discussion of various fields of prediction... and insights as to what distinguishes them.<br />Very fun read. Not dense.<br />Not a cook book on short cuts to make predictions. You need to apply common sense and be insightful.... actually make predictions and learn from mistakes.<br />If you already are a good (poker player, investor, scientist) you are not likely to learn much that is new to apply to your field. But perhaps you are not as good as you think... and you will still be entertained by the various stories and by the cross field comparisons.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love playing Mahjongg since my husband's not that into board games.  At least I can play against the computer and keep my brain happy with a little challenge.  And it's very handy to have on my Kindle.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|I waited for this to go on sale ($4.99 on Blu ray) and than I bought it. I was not really pleased with the lack of story line or substance in the movie but the eye candy is well worth the cheap investment to add this title to your movie library. If great visuals and pretty ladies are all right for you I would say buy it.

1451650728|4.0|This was a an interesting, but at the same time difficult book to read.  The center portion was written thru the voice of Dr. Soong, Data's creator, who also created Lore, B-4 and Jeanine (if I remember the name correctly).<br />Dr. Soong's memory is a lot better than mine, because there were many references in the book I could not remember, in spite of reading the Typhon Pact and seeing the movie 'Nemesis.'  Dr. Soong seemed to get more relentless throughout the book, trying to preserve himself as an android, but continouslyseeking out his creations.  I was very fond of Data and the cover of the book was very appealing.  I did feel that Dr. Soong's ending was appropriate, but also thought that Data might be inheriting some data which might argue against his innocence and ability to work well with whatever his next goal might be. Frankly I was a little surprised he did not appropriate Spot, his cat, upon regaining his abilities.  I have bought book II of this series and look forward to whatever next transpires.<br />Linda Sheean
B005NJU8PA|3.0|First of all. I liked the book and I recommend it. It's fun and Tim Ferris shares some really great techniques and information. It took me about a week to read it and during that time I've made about ten of the recipes and they were good. Plus, I learned some great cooking 'tricks' which was what I was hoping to get from the book.<br /><br />Personally, I would have preferred that the book stuck to that. Here are some great cooking 'hacks' and a bunch of recipes that will impress your friends. It was all there, but it was surrounded by a bunch of stuff that I simply don't care about.<br /><br />Tea pairings? How to build a survival hut? Guns? A bunch of expensive kitchen gear and your hunting knife collection? Honestly, I could care less about that stuff in the context of this book. Still, I've got to give him credit.<br /><br />Back in 2003 when I wrote Rough Living: Tips and Tales of a Vagabond - this was sort of the book I was shooting for, but I wasn't writing it for people who are friends with Mark Zuckerberg or go to billionaire dinner parties in Silicon valley. That's why every publisher I went to said \\"We love it but you've written it for people without money and they don't buy books.\\" They were right. Later, after Katrina, I revised it to a free version with a bunch of hobo recipes in it and gave the book away as Rough Living: An Urban Survival Manual. In both cases, publishers told me I was writing for the wrong audience: people without money. Ferris figured out how to do it - he wrote a foodie recipe book with survival skills and some cool tricks and techniques.<br /><br />But the bragging and the expensive gear? That stuff kind of ruined the book for me. I've bought but haven't read the 4-Hour Body yet, but if it's filled with the same rich kid ingredients instead of simple, practical advice - I'm going to be disappointed by it.<br /><br />The thing is - and to his credit, Ferris touches on this in the conclusion of the book - you don't need to spend a dime on gear or equipment to be a good cook or have a nice day. My hat's off to Tim Ferris for getting this book written and finding an angle to sell it to publishers by aiming it straight at people with money - I just wish he'd focused more on the hobo stove and less on the micro-planer.<br /><br />Get the book. You'll enjoy it. Feel free to skip around - it's better that way.ime on gear or equipment to be a good cook or have a nice day.

0425263908|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!! It compared to 50 Shades of Grey and Gideon filled the void that Christian left. I can't wait to read the next book!
B001E45XT4|5.0|Very good product very good investment for my prodject. Im very happy i found and bought this item. Good item for my project makes me proud to have found this
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Everytime when the background color changes all my data erases. I had so many hooverboards a high score and many coins but now it is all tine. Besides that this is a fun game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A great book. A love story that's a little different, making it the best trilogy I've ever read.You won't want to put it down.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This is a great movie. Really gives you a great understanding of how the sport of body building became more popular and what Arnold has to do with it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|one of my all time favorite television series. even better now that they are begining to address issues that make the characters more believable.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have now published two ebooks and if I had known it was that easy I would have done it long ago. You living up to your name Amazon, you are amazing. Thankyou.
0810989956|1.0|I am a 5th grade teacher and have banned this book from my classroom.  I discovered that one of my male students was using this book to bully another boy in my classroom.  The interaction of this book only generated more bullying towards another child.  He shared his thoughts with other students during recess and therefore the child, who was being bullied, was dealing with a lot of unnecessary stress at the age of 10.  As an educator,I do not recommend this book unless parents periodically take a look inside to see what their child is writing and to take action if they discover that the use of the book has been to bully another child.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|My friends recommended that I read Game of Thrones based on our similar tastes in reading material. I was loaned the paperback version, and made it a couple chapters in before I put it down out of a combination of boredom and a general lack of interest in poorly written books.<br /><br />A few years later, I was convinced to give it another try by someone who had also hated the first few chapters, but said that it got better. I purchased the kindle version.<br /><br />It is far superior to the paperback.<br /><br />The complete lack of proof reading in the Kindle version means that people shout \\"Howl\\" instead of \\"How!\\" Some sentences are turned into haiku by completely random punctuation. You can agree with Eddard when he laments into the darkness that he is a Tool. You can stare in confusion at the word £he. You can ponder what word or words 'sunrise is a contraction of. You can read the book in a William Shatner voice thanks to randomly italicized and embolded words.<br /><br />Basically, you are rewarded for slogging through this mediocre erotica by these scattered typos. It becomes a fun game to reread a sentence several times trying on different punctuation and similar looking words until it makes sense. I'm proud to say I've satisfactorily solved most of these puzzles, though a few of them still have me stumped. Some of the more difficult ones use numbers instead of letters.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Kindle version of this book, as it makes reading a mediocre story with flat, lifeless characters talking about breaking fasts and playing the game of thrones all the time actually entertaining. One star for the story, one star for consistently hilarious lack of proof reading combine for a total pf 2 stars.<br /><br /> (The word \\"pf\\" courtesy of Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One, Kindle Edition)
B002QH2NUA|5.0|Bought this CD after seeing him live in Houston in November 2012. This is pretty much like his current show, changing out just a couple of songs; was a great evening for us, he surrounds himself with a great band, and this is almost like a souvenir of the concert we attended; just change the names of the cities. Am enjoying the CD's and the DVD tremendously!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent game!  Really engaging and FUN to play.  The story line was really good, and unfolded at a great pace!  One of the things I loved about the game is that you can make it as hard or easy as you like. If you get stuck, there's plenty of opportunity to get some help and clues!  In some cases, they'll just walk you through.  I highly recommend this game for hours of FUN!!!
1451613512|5.0|The hope is that a future edition of this book will record the true story of Bradley Manning since today's journalists seem unable or unwilling to do that.
B005NJU8PA|2.0|Lengthy introduction irrelevant to cooking and the author then used the book to put some ads on cooking materials and thats it...dont waste your money.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was really suspenseful and I loved how it never gets boring. I think it was the best one so far in the series and it completely fulfilled my expectations after I read all the rest of the books- they've all been so great! Anyone who has liked any books by Rick Riordan and has read the Percy Jackson series will LOVE this book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is funny but poignant! But uplifting and a great movie.<br />I have watched it several times.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|i dont get how the free version on google is updated already. but when i pay 3$ .for app. no update still after 4 days after other one. guess i wont be wasting anymore time or money on this series
B00081U7HC|5.0|My wife loves this movie so I got the anniversary edition. There are lots of editions out there, not too sure why, there isn't any difference between them as far as I can tell. Anyway, if you're looking at this you know what the movie is all about. i went with this edition because it was less expensive than all the other editions, but the movie is still the same. Honestly we've never been into the special features so i can't comment on those. The movie is good (my wife says).
B0057R5XRG|4.0|These are must own classics. My family is partial to part 3 though, as am I...it's better than the first two. I took off one star because of the picture quality. These are supposed to be blu rays, but the picture quality is DVD at best. Maybe it has not been remastered. My copy of the lost boys blu ray looked way better than this.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|the game is ok, but still has ads and always wants to link me to the angry birds website to buy a different version. i bought this version first so my kids didn't go clicking all over the place- happening anyway. Now I'm angry
B0024F13NC|4.0|The terrible songs, Rattlesnake Shake and Time For A Change, drag it down to 4 stars.  No metal song should contain horns.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|its amazon. Its an MP3 player. Oh shoot its a love child!!!!!! I like it plenty, when i hear a song on amazon I like I go and buy it from amazon so it keeps all my digital content localized and available on the cloud. plus amazon always has promos where you can get free music. i just got a $2 credit just for being a prime member!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was great fun! But I'm biased because I'm a Marvel fan. If you love Marvel movies Avengers needs to be included in your collection.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Was expecting something more creepy but this was still a fun little adventure creatively put together.  Probably more suited for a young adult though...my daughter should enjoy thoroughly.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Of all the recent Marvel Origin movies, Thor is definitely one of the most humorous. It was a pleasant surprise to see some of the best actors appear in a comic book themed film like this one.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|I did not enjoy this CD.  This CD represents several styles of music, but it did not work for me.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Iron Man 2 may not have the magic of Iron Man but it was still loads of fun and of course, Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal as Tony Stark!
B004YKSXYW|5.0|A highly enjoyable, anecdotal overview that affords the layman an effortless grand perspective. I'm glad that I found it and would recommend it to my friends.
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was three and I can't believe it's out on blu-ray! It may not be the greatest horror movie in the world but it sure is funny!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|What can you say about grease. It works ? This was nicely packed, easy to apply, and appears to be keeping the CPU nicely cool coupled with an liquid cooled fan.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Definitely the best Terminator of the franchise! I love the crisp quality of the blu-ray and the fact that it offers different versions of the film,
B004UC4HCG|5.0|This barebones unit is a perfect fit for the free version of VMWare ESXi 5.1. The max memory of 32GB and plenty of SATA and eSATA connections means you can stuff the unit with plenty of storage. One note, make sure you update the BIOS to the latest version from shuttle's website to take advantage of all the features this unit has to offer and improve stability. This is a fantastic system and my final build is fully loaded and works great. Highly Recommended.
B00275EGX8|5.0|I remember being at the edge of my seat when i first saw this movie. It is a great film!
B004EPZ03O|5.0|This movie was very well done, everyone that I know who has seen it has loved it. (15 yrs old +) The couple of younger kids I know who have seen it thought it was ok but they didn't really know the Muppets.
B000W10AEI|5.0|As a Potter fan I was happy to discover that the deleted scenes were included on the blu-ray. The movie starts immediately when you insert it to your player and if you press the menu button it will take you to the special features menu with the trailers, deleted scenes, languages etc.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is my Favorite movie of all time. Please excuse the title of this review, I couldn't help myself. lol.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The easier games are far too easy, but the latter ones can be very challenging. Love this when I'm sitting waiting at the docs office and need something to do. Only complaint is the last pack, which is the most challenging, is intended for tablets only, and too small to use on a phone without messing up as my fingers aren't small enough to drag the right lines, not run into others, etc. But overall, very fun, very addictive game, and perfect price.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I saw this movie with my boyfriend while it was in theaters, and I loved it so much I had to take my mom to watch it. It does have some questionable subject matter (ex. there are a few references to nudity) that make it somewhat inappropriate for the younger audiences. The basic theme is 'finding your own destiny', and the main character certainly breaks quite a few rules to do so. In the end though, she realizes what her mistakes were and is deeply sorry for them; which in turn makes her and her mother closer. Kinda sounds like my teenage years...
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Well done. Peter Dunklage (sp?) is awesome! There is sword play and word play, and dragons. What more could one want from a sci-fi fantasy show?
B001992NUQ|5.0|The book-to-movie translation of this title is by far the best rendition I have ever seen. Maybe besides the Harry Potter series, but even in those movies scenes from the books were left out.<br />Fight Club is really a piece of art, and the actors and directors did a great job.
030758836X|1.0|I was excited to get Gone Girl because it has been pretty highly ranked lately. When I first started the book, I wasn't convinced it was something I would love; I didn't find the writing to be very engaging, believable, or well-done. As you keep reading the book, though, you could get the impression that this approach is purposeful, I suppose, because of one of the plot twists. For that reason, and because there was a good bit of suspense even early on in the novel, I did keep reading it. Ultimately, I even read to the very last page, increasingly cursing myself for having gotten myself too far in to quit now. I'll admit, there are numerous plot-twists and surprises that kept me going back to the book. I kept hoping that many of the traits that I so disliked about the novel, and the writing, would be revealed to be elements of the plot themselves, even. Retrospectively, though, I've got little to recommend in this book. You may read to the end, but it won't be a satisfying, fully-realized reading, and, if you are anything like me, you'll wish you had used that time for something else.<br /><br />Overall, here are my complaints with this book:<br />1. The ending was terrible. It was a mishmash of cheap plot tricks, unlikely scenarios, and even more unlikely (and unlikable) character decisions. Yes, all the loose ends were tied up, but at what cost?<br />2. The characters were ridiculous. There was not a single character that wasn't contrived from a number of stereotypical flat representations we've seen a million times (usually these flat characters are reserved for minor roles; not in this text).<br />3. The plot never seemed very well thought-out. Frequently, when one problem got too big for the author to handle, there was a conveniently planned revelation that, no, the main character had already predicted this approach, and, two years earlier, had concocted a plan B, or C, or D, that itself was even more ludicrous than the original plot wrinkle had been.<br />4. The writing wasn't particularly good. Sometimes, even poorly constructed plots could be saved by really stellar, awe-inspiring prose. Not in this novel.<br /><br />Good luck!
B000056BAG|4.0|The vinyl is in perfect condition but the outer jacket of the album cover had a large bend in the upper right corner.
B000EHSVS2|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. As much or more then when I first saw it 42 years ago. I loved George C. Scott's performance in this role.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Amazing read!  Couldn't put it down for the last 1/4th of the book.  Great writing, imagery, and story.  Looking forward to reading the next book and any book from this awesome author!
B00683JLXA|3.0|Ive played this game on my phone so I installed it on the Kindle. I like the phone version better. Some of the levels are harder on the Kindle version.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|HOLLYWOOD never seems to surprise me lately, with using old run down actors for new actor roles. The action, dialogue, and written material was a waste of time. The movie became a skip to some action movie, real fast. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE. Can't say I didn't warn you!!!!
B0050KEVO6|3.0|I chose this game because I was searching for more games similar to the Alchemy Genetics game. I love Alchemy Genetics. This game is a little bit similar but you can only go so far before the game gets difficult. It's not as kid friendly as the Alchemy Genetics, which helps stimulate the children's problem solving and imaginative skills.
0446580848|1.0|I was a big DeMille fan but his latest book, The Panther, is a big bore. The story is super thin with no twists or interesting characters. John Cory has evolved into a caricture of his former self. A wise cracking, male chauvenist with few redeeming features. The rest of the cast are cardboard. It reads as if DeMille was \\"mailing it in\\" instead of seriously writing an adventure novel. Even if you liked his previous books, skip this one. Better luck next time.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|The message in this movie is powerful.  A must see for ALL fathers and a families.  It's a message that have been slowly losing ground in our society.  Please everyone buy.  I'm giving it as gifts to everyone i know this Christmas.
3822837849|5.0|A truely outstanding volume that  distinctly and  eloquently displays  the history of  photography and  indeed of  modern art  at the turn of the century, and  does this  while  shedding serious  light on the  work, mind, and the pathos  of Alred Stieglitz, a  man truely ahead of his time.<br /><br />I was expecting to find  a  few interesting works  from the pictorialist era, and beyond, but instead  i found a  book quite full to the brim with engaging and  brilliant photography that i found both mezmerizing and  totally inspiring.<br /><br />This era of  photography has been largely left behind, as  modernist \\"straight\\" photography  has  taken over even the most remote corners of the photographic art world, but despite what you may have  been taught, there  was  much to recomend for much of the best of  the  pictorialist movement as represented  by  Stieglitz in Camera Work.<br /><br />I can not  recomend this  book too highly for anyone with an enquireing mind  and an open heart about  photographic art, and  pictorialism in particular
B007Y6OZE0|4.0|I have been an Offspring fan for 13 years. I have all their albums, and they are my favorite band. With that being said, I just felt a little let down by this album. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of songs from this record that have been added to my list of their best songs, but I just felt that it couldn't compete to some of their earlier stuff. Of all their music, there are only 2 songs that I have detested so much as to actually delete them from my computer and iPod: \\"Demons (A Mexican Fiesta), and \\"OC Guns.\\" I'm kind of ashamed of that. I get the joke of OC Guns, but I just couldn't find anything enjoyable about it.<br />But, there are plenty of songs that made me happy to buy it, like The Future is Now, I Wanna Secret Family with You, Dirty Magic, All I have Left is You, Cruising California, and Slim Pickens. To be honest, \\"All I have Left is You\\" and \\"Fix You\\" are probably my two favorites of all. Songs like that, along with so many others,  make me proud to have stuck with these guys for so long, and they will keep me coming back until they stop making records.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I had to laugh when Ian Anderson commented in the liner notes that he was not really Christian pretty obvious. Still one of my favorites. Songs are well done and a good selection and a generally a fun album to listen to. I remember when it wasn't the thing to record Christmas albums. Now it seems all the recording artists do that. I'm happy to see that.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I like this show because it made the &#34;bad guy&#34; human. I could relate to him and empathize with him.
B0094M4O3O|5.0|You do not have a heart if this movies does not bring you to tears. It should be standard viewing fare for all folks and kids interested in the game of Football. I am not a Notre Dame fan by any means but this is a very compelling story based on true events. Highly recommended.....
B004TTHLBE|3.0|I have heard that this book was groundbreaking. I'm not sure about that but I found it to be interesting. Overall I liked the story but have found it to be largely forgettable.
B0081BU42O|4.0|Hard science fiction, with a touch of humor, in a richly realized universe. Just great. If you like science fiction definitely do yourself a favor and read Iain M. Banks and this Sonata.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I love this box set.  It is an amazing gift.  It includes all of the seasons and is very attractively put together.  This is a must have for all Sex and the City fans.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Crashed for me, too.  Hopefully they can fix it....looks like a fun game.  Just got the 8.9 Fire HD 4G LTE. Lovin' it!!!
B003VANOFY|2.0|For the longest time, I have been using corded headsets. For the most part, they have always been high enough quality for what I wanted to do. The one main drawback was that you had to remain near to your computer, and if you did need to go somewhere else, you had to tilt the person or persons on the other end that you were going AFK. Sometimes it is nice to be able to visit comfortable chair while chatting with friends, so I decided that I wanted to have a wireless headset. In the past, Logitech was always one of my first choices. I knew that Logitech made several different wireless headsets, but I did not know about the quality of the different models. After talking to several friends who own the Logitech G930, I received glowing testimonials. I also read through a ton of online reviews for the headset which were almost all positive as well. So, in the end I decided to go ahead and get the Logitech G930.<br /><br />Upon receiving the headset I was quite excited as expected, and got everything set up according to the instructions. Unfortunately, not but a day or two later I discovered some strange behavior. The headset was perfect in every respect but it would only charge if the headset's power was turned on. If you turn off the headset, or the headset timed out due to inactivity then charging would stop. I asked my friends (the ones that also own the Logitech G930) if they had the same problem - perhaps this is just how the headset worked? But no, they did not have the same problem. Everything else about headset was awesome and so I did not want to just get a refund or anything like that, so I contacted Logitech and they said that it was a hardware failure and to send it in for repair or replacement. I sent it in, and they sent me a brand-new headset - I was happy that it was not a refurbished replacement.<br /><br />After opening the box, the first thing that I noticed was that the microphone boom refused to stay in an upright position. The headset is built so that you can rotate the microphone boom up in order to automatically mute yourself then lower it and talk once again. Since the boom on the replacement refused to stay in the upright position, I was constantly un-muting myself accidentally. The battery didn't charge correctly unlike my first pair of this headset, and I initially thought that I could just ignore the loose boom, but unfortunately there was a more severe problem with this replacement. After letting the headset charge to full, only moments after unplugging the charging cable the headset would beep at me and a pop-up dialog would appear indicating that there was only an hour battery remaining. According to the specifications, and my previous headset, the Logitech G930 is supposed to last at least six hours - and from experience it was more like 8 to 10 hours on average. I tested charging a few more times, and the problem persisted so I contacted Logitech a second time. Logitech again told me that it was a hardware failure, and replaced it a second time.<br /><br />After receiving my third Logitech G930, I checked to be sure that none of the previous issues existed in the replacement which they thankfully did not. Sadly, they did have yet another problem. This third pair was working fine for approximately half a day and then out of the blue they started having a problem in which when you turn the power on there is a loud screeching static noise, after approximately 5 seconds of this noise the headset then automatically turns itself off. I tried several ways of fixing the issue, most common sense and other ideas which I found by doing Google searches for others who had the same problem. Nothing helped. At this point, I was unsure that returning it for a fourth headset would do any good at all, so instead I just decided to go ahead and get a refund. I am not sure which alternative to try, but if this is how Logitech's hardware is these days, as indicated by many reviews and cries for help from others who havehad problems, then I believe I'm going to avoid Logitech.<br /><br />Despite all of the problems which I had, in the small windows in which the headset was working properly I did note several things which I really enjoyed. I wish that I could have received a headset that worked properly the first time and continue to work properly over time like many of the five star reviewers here have had the pleasure of experiencing. I will say that Logitech's customer support was very accommodating and quick to respond, but they might need to look into their quality control department or something. Because the headset never worked 100% for me, I cannot give it a three star review, but despite the problems I did not hate the headset and am giving it two stars.<br /><br />This is an amazing headset as long as you can get one that works. Everything about the Logitech G930's features is top-notch and you are getting a very high-quality headset that is an insane bargain at its price. If I had gotten a working headset - even if I had to return the first few - then I would have certainly given this headset a four or five star review.had problems, then I believe I'm going to avoid Logitech.<br /><br />Despite all of the problems which I had, in the small windows in which the headset was working properly I did note several things which I really enjoyed.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|My family emigrated to Canada from the environment described in this book. I absolutely loved the character development and the easy mingling of fiction and fact. Only one character is one dimensional and he continues that way in book two. A terrific read and great insight into the complicated history of the day.
B000JIHP88|2.0|This mobile is absolute junk!  From day one the thing would stop spinning at times unless you tapped it to start again.  Now after two weeks the only thing it's good for is playing the music.  It doesn't spin at all now.  Very frustrating when your 3 month old is captured by it as she falls asleep and then it quits working.  So disappointed!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World continues the saga of the familes introduced in Volume 1. The characters mature and continue to develop. What's fascinating is the way Follett weaves personal events into the major political crises of the time. I could not put it down and read it in two days.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Although I live in EU I ordered this one from USA, because of the price difference. The box arrived today properly and safely packed with an special box that fits the set like a glove. 10/10 for Amazon for the package and Fast shipping, avoiding custom taxes since Amazon ships first to their owm facilities in Germany, and then without problems to any other EU country.  The box looks awesome and the vinyls I've played so far (Rubber Soul, Past Masters, etc) sounds fantastic, and have not experienced any of the problems suffered by other costumers.  I' ll update the review once I continue listening to the lp's... So far I'm more than happy and completely satisfied with the set.  ===================================================================================  UPDATE  ===================================================================================  I've played, look and hear carefully (most of them with headphones) all of the lp's inside the box. No major problems, only a very little insignificant warped one, and a noisy end (one second or so) in \\"I'll follow the sun\\", in Beatles for Sale album.  Completely pleased with the set. Sound fantastic & looks fantastic and no pressing issues.    For those claiming that the sound of these lp's it's bad (or not good enough) I paste here the lp by lp results of the reviews made by analogplanet.com, a web for die-hards vinyls (and beatles) fans that are reviewing the whole USA set, using top end incredible gear, comparing the sound with original UK pressings, and even japanese or german ones. They also, do not have any press issues so far.    In this moment the reviews of vinyls SOUND are like this:    Please Please - Not reviewed  With The Beatles - Not reviewed  A Hard's Day Night - 10/10  Beatles for Sale - 9/10  Help - Not reviewed  Rubber Soul - 5/10  Revolver - 9/10  Sgt Peppers - 10/10  Magical Mystery - 8/10  The beatles - 6/10  Yellow Submarine - Not Reviewed  Abbey Road - 8/10  Let It Be - 8/10  Past Masters - 10/10    The reviewer, a Beatle's expert himself, considers in some cases that some of the reissues, are better than the originals in some ways.  In my opinion, if you get a clean copy, without any issue this a 100/100 box set. I understand the dissapoinment of those receiving defective boxes but not for the sound of the vinyls that are really very very good.    ==================================================================================    UPDATE III - Complete Review by expert site Analog Planet: Set: 9/10 , Pressing: 90+/100    ==================================================================================  I paste here the review... very interesting and helpful I would say.    A woman walks into a butcher shop. She says \\"Can I see that chicken?\\" The butcher hands it to her. She smells it in front, she smells it in back, she smells it all over and then hands it back to the butcher saying \\"Mister, this chicken stinks!\\" The butcher replies \\"Lady, could you pass a test like that?\\"    No chicken could pass that lady's test.    My point is that I felt obliged to take this Beatles box apart and examine it more closely than was probably necessary and be as critical as necessary, from my perspective, which might not be the same as yours.    Had I done all of the listening and writing first, it would have been old news by now, so I chose to go album by album. Now let's put it all in perspective in terms of concept, presentation, sound quality and value.    Clearly the concept here was not to reissue the original albums as heard in 1963-1970. Were that the case, they would sound far closer to the originals than they do. Clearly they don't as I demonstrated to myself comparing a CD made from the Sgt. Peppers... master tape with the original Parlophone pressing. They sounded remarkably similar. Not so the reissued LP.    A reissue in the strictest sense would be as close as possible a reproduction of the original. It would be done in the analog domain and every attemptwould have been made to match the original LPs' EQ. Mistakes would not be corrected, the 'de-essing' would be done using the old school real time method as it's done when necessary today by the guys who cut from analog tape.    Mistakes--all of them--would be left in, including popped \\"p\\"s etc. just as did Kevin Gray's Nat King Cole reissues for Analogue Productions.    The goal here was to improve the originals without upsetting their essence. It was more a \\"re-imagining\\" of the Beatles catalog than a \\"reissuing.\\" The best way to do that, the producers felt, was to digitize at high resolution and use that as the starting point for the \\"restoration\\". There are those who argue that EMI insisted on attenuating bass on pop and rock records as a matter of sonic policy and that bass was rolled off on Beatle albums so why not restore it on the reissues?    Clearly there's more bass, in my opinion a lot more bass, throughout this reissue set. Sometimes it sounds welcome but at other times it sounds heavy-handed. Because forty and fifty years of playing these records have worn grooves in my mind as to what they should sound like? Or because the mastering engineers went overboard?    Without hearing the tapes I'll never know. How these reissues sound to you in that regard will depend upon your system's bass performance. Overall, a majority of the EQ choices produced improvements, but sometimes not. When mono mixes were substituted for \\"reprocessed for stereo ones\\", well no argument from me!    Clearly the engineers feel that digitizing analog at high sampling and bit rates is essentially transparent to the source or they might not have done it. And once they had the music captured at 192/24 bit they also felt down-converting it to 44.1/24 wouldn't diminish the sonic quality.    Here, I definitely differ with the producers! There's a definite loss of transparency and \\"believability\\" on these albums compared to the originals. There's a definite loss of image solidity and coherence compared to the originals. You can \\"see\\" each Beatle in the original pressing's sonic picture with great clarity and precision that you simply can't on the reissue, even when the EQ makes for a much more appealing tonal balance.    Not everyone cares about this stuff, just as some will find the Rhino Doors box cut from digital masters more than adequate while others upon hearing the double 45s issued AAA will never want to go back to the box so profound are the differences and is the listening experience.    Much of this box set sounds very good on the terms set by the mastering team. However, in my opinion both Abbey Road and The Beatles are serious sonic failures, particularly the former. If you don't think so, you've not heard a UK Apple original. In the cases of those two albums, particularly Abbey Road every attempt should have been made to duplicate the originals. Abbey Road was perfect: open, transparent, soaring. Now it's heavy and thick. It plods instead of soar.    I hope in the future someone can license that tape for an AAA reissue plated and pressed at one of the top pressing plants. The Beatles original pressing is a bit hard and perhaps lacking somewhat on bottom, but the sense of being in the room and \\"seeing\\" the performers in the studio on the other side of the microphone is palpable. Not so on the reissue.    Probably were the engineers responsible for the reissues to read this they'd think I'm plain nuts. I accept. This box wasn't aimed at purist audiophiles. It was aimed at Beatles fans. Most of them will think these the best sounding Beatles albums they've ever heard, especially if Capitol's were there only reference.    Speaking of pressing quality, overall I think Rainbo did an excellent job. If I had to rate them out of 100%, they'd get a 90+% from me.    While even the best pressing in my box was not as drop dead quiet as what RTI, QRP or Pallas is capable of, Rainbo's pressings were quiet with but a few minor fleeting defects. None of the aforementioned plants are capable of perfection either. My box was bought as yours was. It wasn't a \\"special\\" reviewer sample. I paid my monies and tooks my chances.    Imagine what a job it was to press so many records, collate them, package them and box them. it must have taken the better part of a year and filled Rainbo's plant to capacity with boxes, books and jackets--while they simultaneously pressed other projects. Yet the box I opened was physically perfect in every way. They get my applause.    My phone friend Guy Hayden at EMI who oversaw the project promised to send me an Optimal box to compare but I haven't seen it. Perhaps after reading how carefully I smelled that chicken he's decided I didn't deserve it. Or perhaps he forgot so I can't at this time tell you how the two boxes compare.    As for the book. I can't believe no one's commented on the book. It's spectacular. The presentation, the paper stock, the binding, every aspect of it makes it among the, if not the best book about The Beatles ever. It may not be the most comprehensive but it surely is the smartest in terms of concept and execution.    You get an album by album \\"history\\" giving you the most salient aspects of what was happening in The Beatles' lives, set against what happened in the studio all accompanied by the most sumptuous photo spreads. Really, the book alone is worth $75-$100. It's something I'll treasure whichever versions of the albums I choose to play. My only criticism is that it's heavy. My arms got tired!    Ironically, Mr. Hayden told me a few years ago that it was the book not the record production that kept delaying the box's release. It was worth the wait because the book is a 100% success. I wish as much attention had been lavished on the pressings and especially upon the jackets! In the ideal world they would be laminated \\"fold overs\\" like the originals. What that would have done to the cost I don't know but I imagine it would have hiked the box's cost by around$100 so I understand why it wasn't done.    The questions are: why was RTI not used at least for the plating? RTI plated the first five albums but apparently only a few plated lacquers ended up being used for production. Not even RTI's Don MacInnis was aware of that. And why was RTI not used to press the records (QRP didn't have the capacity and wasn't even up and running as the job was being contemplated)? Was it cost? RTI's inability to cope with the pressing demand? We'll never know but clearly Rainbo lived up to EMI's expectations if not ours, and if you got a few bad pressings hopefully replacements were made available.    Finally there's the issue of value. Considering that a clean original UK pressing of The Beatles will set you back almost the cost of this entire box (around $300), and this box gives you the entire collection including Past Masters, which otherwise doesn't exist, this box of 180g LPs plus super book has to rate as a very, very good value. Of course I still that like The Doors AAA reissues, at some point someone will offer EMI and Apple and the surviving Beatles and the estates of John and George enough money to entice them to let the tapes have another pass while lacquers are cut directly from them. At least for starters Abbey Road should be so produced.    Yes, I smelled the chicken, but unlike that lady at the butcher's, I paid for and took home the chicken and I'm sure glad I did! Despite my clucking, it's a pretty tasty meal! P.S.: I thank everyone for their thoughtful comments along the way. I learned a lot and that's one of the best parts about having this site!

B005PK553C|2.0|The story was interesting and I would liked it for that, but I don't care to watch people masturbating and having sex.  I wish they would have toned that aspect of it down a bit or left it out altogether as it was rather graphic.  Oh well, can't please everyone.

I learned so much about past and present societies through the eyes of a knowledgeable author. I knew almost nothing about the topics, places, laws, animals, etc contained in the book. As soon as I am finished with my MBA program, I am going to reread this book, and others by Jared Diamond.

B000BYA5G4|5.0|Lord of War plays like a documentary, but a fascinating one.  It tells the story of the rise of the international arms trade and the horrors it brings to the world.  Gun runner, Yuri Orlov (masterfully played by Nicolas Cage), narrates the film, which follows his dangerous career through riches to loss of soul.  The film's clincher is the revelation that individual arms dealers are a tiny part of the trade: the big guys in the business are the five governments on the UN security  council, number one being us (U.S., that is).
B001C1066E|4.0|The Gama-chan I got is different than in the display as expected since I've read other reviews on this product that said the same thing. I think I'll add onto the red material inside and remove a little stuffing to make more room for coins. Other than that, I like it very much!
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Although not totally realistic about living with our own and other's psychological vulnerabilities, this film captures the heartbreak and the frustration of those involved with a sense of humor that helps to heal the wounds any of us have from our personal experiences.  I loved it.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Slowly but surely I am getting all of the music to the Twilight Saga, even the music scores.  I do have Twilight, Breaking Dawn 1 and 2, and do must say that I am an older fan, 50 years, and can I say that I really do love all of the music, the upbeat, the romantic slow music and the in-between! And yes, I have a musical background, know what is good and what is not good, and not just because Robert Pattinson, who by the way, is an accomplished pianist and guitarist, is in the films! I also love Carter Burwell, love his composing and arranging of the orchstra. I loved how they wedded both BD 1&2 with Christina Perri with \\"A Thousand Years\\". So if anyone is wary about purchasing this album, don't be, enjoy, truly!
B0072HDP9M|5.0|After reading this marvelous book again, I want to say like Ninny Threadgoode that I might be here, but in my mind I am over at the Whistle Stop Cafe having a plate of fried green tomatoes. I would go on a road trip in a flash if I could just find the place...and Idgie, Ruth, Big George, Sipsey and the southern food. This is the thing with this book: it just pulls you in and although terrible things happen, the people with their love and friendship and loyalty make the world a safe haven, also for you, the reader.  So, this time around I am going to make the fried green tomatoes...I've got the recipe...it is there at the end of the book. I've always lost my hardcopy, probably lend it to someone. Now, I've got it as an e-book, so I read it again...in a few month's time. One of my all time favorites...

If you've yet to dive into the completely justified hysteria that surrounds &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; go ahead. Start with Season 1, episode 1. I'll wager dollars to doughnuts, you'll marathon your way through the seasons until you're like the rest of us: chomping at the bit, waiting for next summer's final eight episodes.

B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I've been a big Linkin Park fan since a little after \\"Hybrid Theory\\". To date, \\"Meteora\\" remains my favorite Linkin Park album. When I listened to \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" and \\"A Thousand Suns\\", I was a bit disappointed. It wasn't the Linkin Park I knew as they tried to go for the more \\"adult\\" sound. The problem with that is that they try to be more political. \\"Living Things\\" actually hearkens back to the \\"Meteora\\" days while still preserving their new sound. The result is something closer to party rock than anything LMFAO would ever do with more lyrical substance too. Linkin Park's lyrics are much sharper than before, especially in \\"Lies Greed Misery\\". Mike Shinoda's rapping reminds me so much of \\"Meteora\\", and the music sounds like a better version of \\"I Can Transform Ya\\" by Chris Brown.<br /><br />But it doesn't stop there. On the most poignant of songs, he actually does sing. And to be honest, these songs have to be the best on the album. The two songs are \\"Castle of Glass\\", which is so minimalist compared to Linkin Park's other songs yet so emotionally poignant, and \\"Roads Untraveled\\", possibly the most poetic song they've ever written and by far their best song to date. The lyrics and the music prove so beautiful and so powerful, and Chester and Mike compliment each other so well.<br /><br />Much of their other songs sound pretty similar to what they've done in the past. \\"Burn it Down\\" almost mirrors \\"What I've Done\\" and \\"New Divide\\". Needless to say, Linkin Park fans will enjoy this album as its truer to their roots without forsaking their new direction.<br /><br />If the album itself doesn't satisfy your tastes, definitely get these songs:<br />\\"Burn it Down\\"<br />\\"Lies Greed Misery\\"<br />\\"Castle of Glass\\"<br />\\"Roads Untraveled\\"<br />\\"Powerless\\"

B003XDUCIG|3.0|This is the perfect starting point for people willing to learn how to cook. There is an overview of what to do with the most common ingredients, and there are many recipes.<br /><br />The only point that really made me want to ask for my money back was the paranoid attitude of the writer with food safety. All the time the minimum cooking temperatures are repeated over and over, and there is absolutely no mention that some FDA guidelines are totally exagerated.<br /><br />Also, some tables on the kindle version don't work correctly, it's basically impossible to read some in a logical way. I recommend the physical version
B008RTE09S|2.0|I purchased the Blu Ray of this kooky movie.  The restoration is excellent with good sound quality and picture quality.  Unfortunately, the movie is of historical interest and is actually annoying after the first or second viewing.  The reason we want to watch this is the.... MUSIC.  It is great to watch the restored I am the Walrus or Your Mother Should Know. However, the original Magical Mystery Tour album/CD contains a second side of songs including Strawberry Fields Forever, Hello Goodbye, Penny Lane, Baby You're a Rich Man and All you need is love.  None of the videos for these songs are on this disc except a boring alternate video for Hello Goodbye.  For $25 bucks couldn't we get these extra videos with good sound and video quality?  Ridiculous.  And there is no booklet.

B0070Y46UY|3.0|1) Rating: 3 out of 5 Stars    2) Genre: Fantasy    3) Synopsis: Trapped on a lifeboat Pi not only needs to survive Mother Nature but the huge tiger that is trapped on there with him.    4) Feelings: I really hoped this was based on a true story but it isn't. I would describe this book as interesting more than good. The main problem with this story is lack of dialog. The problem is if you are trapped on a boat with a tiger, your dialog is going to be limited.    5) Final recommendation: I found it very interesting and it was certainly something I made time to read. I figure if you make time to read something it must be enjoyable. Will I go see the movie now I have read the book? Probably not. Although I am sure, I will rent it. Although I will recommend reading it vs. watching it.    Ryan James Burt  Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]

B007V65R54|5.0|We must not expect more precision than the subject matter admits.<br />Aristotle<br /><br />Not long after I embarked on the study of psychology, a vague feeling of dissatisfaction with the field began to take hold of me.  It took me a while before I realized why I felt this way, but eventually I came to understand that it was due to two factors:<br /><br />1. The limited ability of the discipline to capture the emotional truths of ordinary experience.<br /><br />2.  The high degree of uncertainty and lack of agreement about research findings.<br /><br />Perhaps I was asking too much of the discipline, too much at this time in its development.  However, in my lifetime, I really didn't see anything to indicate it was making much progress.  Quite to the contrary, all I could see was growing conflict between theoretical accounts, increasing neuro-physiologizing, and continuing contradictions between empirical investigations.<br /><br />I have come to believe that psychology will always have to be content with limitations on the generality of its findings.  They may hold for some people, some of the time, but one never can be sure on any given occasion if they apply to a particular individual in the situation at hand.<br /><br />Nate Silver in The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail But Some Don’t suggests I really need to change my way of thinking.  He very persuasively argues that we can never make the kind of objective predictions I am seeking, that we must learn to think probabilistically about them, and understand that there will always be a certain degree of uncertainty to any prediction.<br /><br />…we must think differently about our ideas—and how to test them. We must become more comfortable with probability and uncertainty. We must think more carefully about the assumptions and beliefs that we bring to a problem.<br /><br />Silver has written an important and extensively documented analysis of predictions made in wide range of subjects including the recent financial meltdown, elections (Silver correctly predicted the Obama’s electoral and popular vote in the last election on his 538 Blog at the Times.), baseball player performance, weather, earthquakes, disease epidemics, the stock market, global warming, terrorist attacks, etc. The notes alone consist of 55 pages of densely annotated citations.<br /><br />He also treats at some length how we can improve on the accuracy of the predictions we make.  The more eagerly we commit to scrutinizing and testing our theories, the more readily we accept that our knowledge of the world is uncertain, the more willingly we acknowledge that perfect prediction is impossible.<br /><br />Silver confronts head on the biases that influence many predictions.  Overconfidence is an especially frequent one, as is our fundamental ignorance of probability theory.  This prevents us from thinking in terms of the conditional probability of a future event.<br /><br />The virtue in thinking probabilistically is that you will force yourself to stop and smell the data—slow down, and consider the imperfections in your thinking. Over time, you should find that this makes your decision making better.<br /><br />But nowhere does Silver treat at any length the kinds of questions that psychologists pose, say, for example, how an individual will feel about a future stressful period in their life, the likelihood that they will change a long-held habit, or the nature of their social relationships, and cognitive processes.<br /><br />Whether or not his methodology can be usefully applied to such issues is an open question.  Regardless, whatever forms his analysis would take, it would inevitably be formulated in probabilistic terms and its value would depend on a certain willingness to accept a considerable degree of uncertainty.  Thus, we circle back to the basic concerns I expressed about psychology at the outset.<br /><br />No doubt Silver will remind us once again that we will inevitably be faced with epistemological uncertainty, especially when it comes to the very considerable difficulties of predicting human behavior.

0446402389|2.0|On reading the excited reviews, I expected something more elevated. Would be readers should realise that this isn't a literary novel. It's just pulp fiction written to the usual formulae and translated to a different setting. There is an excessive emphasis on the depersonalisation, stultification  and routine mutual betrayals apparently characteristic of life under a communist state. This makes the book a depressing and dreary read. In fact, the authentic books set in the same place and era reveal the strength and resilience of the human spirit even in such circumstances. The writing and expression in this book is pretty pedestrian and lacks flair or wit. Not as boring as Scandinavian novels but close.

B0061S0A64|5.0|Works on my Pandigital Supernova 8&quot; bargain tablet. If volume is a problem, use yor device's volume control and/or earbuds (or headphones, or external amp/speaker). Start simple and expriment with one change at a time. Use your menu button, go to &quot;More&quot; and then &quot;info&quot; to start. You need at least one generator (with plus sign: square for percussive beat, round for extended note) and one note (plain circle). Add notes, each a bit farther from the generator, and you have a scale. It's like visual art turned into music. There are sub-menus to experiment with to produce different sounds, kill the mystic echo effect, change the rythm, etc. A walkthrough or tutorial would be nice, maybe even more variaton of the sounds, but I still give it a hearty 4 stars.

B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|1Recommended for those who have some serious virtual music keyboard skills, a touch screen that handles more than two simultaneous touches. And a taste for more obscure Christmas music (or maybe they're familiar to Catholics or Europeans?) But there are some good popular songs, and if you want a challenge, this may be the one you want. For most/average Americans, however, I recommend looking for an easier Chistmas music keyboard app with more familiar songs.

He has a journey that becomes a legend.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie. It has action, drama, Sci-fi/adventure and comedy. There is also a great cast, and great special effects. This movie, in my opinion, is very underrated. I think everyone should see and enjoy this fun fantasy flick.

The only issue I had with this movie was the perverted and somewhat disturbing subject matter. It's just a movie, but it did make me feel a little weird seeing some of the stuff that went on. Overall, this movie is pretty entertaining. I don't think it's one that you'll watch multiple times. Maybe renting it before you buy it is the best idea.

B000T9OP7G|5.0|This series ties in perfectly with the original Terminator movies. I think it's better though. The acting is good, and the story is more involved. The story unfolds and gains momentum in a very good way. There are more characters introduced, and more dilemmas to overcome. The good and bad terminators are also pretty cool. This series has action, drama, and comedy. It's pretty stacked. I recommend it to just about anyone who enjoys a good action/drama.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This was an extremely exciting read and a realistic insight into the life in India..the black market etc..this book would not disappoint
B001TODCII|5.0|When his daughter is kidnapped in Paris, a former CIA spy sets out for Europe to save her. He learns that a sex slave trade group has taken her and he only has a short time to find her before she disappears forever. He uses his skills as an operative to save her and bring the bad guys to justice.<br /><br />This is an awesome movie. Liam Neeson is an awesome actor, and this is one of his best movies. The action and suspense is off the charts, and Liam Neeson's butt kicking skills reach unparalleled heights. This is one of the best action movies I've seen in a long time. If you liked the Bourne Identity, then you'll like Taken.
0345531965|5.0|I love the fact that John Grisham is free and open about his religious belief. He lived long enough, made a successful living writing good books, and is surely entitled to his freedom of religion. This is a story of redemption of a man who had it all yet now praying to die and attempting suicide by abusing substances known to all man kind. There is also his little lecture  regarding human rights of indigenous South American indians. One thing I hated was the hospital in Corumba. I realized how spoiled rotten I am by medical care, electricity, food, and running water compared to people in Pantanal. They live with very little and they are happy with that, such contradiction to our world where a store clerk die trampled by crowd on Black Friday. We have so much more yet still poorer it seems. Also Rachel's conviction and dedication made me examine my way of non existent Christian life. Over all,this book flew me out of my comfortable world  and made me think of all important things of my life. You should read it.
B000OVLBHG|5.0|Planet Klendathu is inhabited by giant bugs. These bugs are overrunning the galaxy. Earth has been attacked and many have died. The soldiers of the space forces are giving their all to fight the alien threat.<br /><br />This movie is great in so many ways. It has comedy, action, drama, and Sci-fi/adventure, as well as some satirical overtones about our society and military priorities. The TV commercials and the wimpy weapons that the infantrymen carry are very satirical. They stab at the control of the government over the masses through media, and make the loss of life on the ground seem meaningless. The technology to wage war without excessive casualties exists, but they send massive amounts of soldiers with lousy weapons in to save money. The acting is okay, but that's not important in this film. The nature of the story allows for a little slack in that regard. The special effects are pretty good and the action is off the charts. This film is awesome, and lots of fun. It's a must see in my opinion.
B0019IMVDG|5.0|I love this movie, saw it years ago and I just bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas.  It is a classic!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Well, it's got ponies in it, and it's a fun little timesink with resource allocation, infrastructure, and economic play, along with minigames.
0060837020|5.0|Amazon's description of the novel describes Esther as beautiful. She is not beautiful, not necessarily brilliant. She is plain with brown hair and brown eyes. As far as her brilliance, she was a big fish in a small pond at her college and when she reaches the big city she begins to see how insignificant she really is. I love this novel, it is by far one of my favorites. Part of the beauty of the novel is that Esther is not this gorgeous, perfect person. She is a normal person who catches a lucky break and spends the remainder of the novel trying to figure out how to repeat her luck; then dealing with it when that does not happen. She is a real character. She is all of us. There is no prince charming. She has to save herself.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I am looking foward to more levels...the only improvement would be the ability to save or continue where you left off instead of doing it all over again. Besides that..I can't complain!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game. Its full of never ending combinations of objects to find. The multiple layers of combinations then what to do with the &quot;cellections&quot; is an exciting adventure set in a wonderfully creepy old mansion.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|Its ok when you need to do something quick , it loads fast but doesnt do flash stuff very well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The only thing wrong with this complete series is that it fits on 4 DVD's.  I loved it.  I came late to the show when there was a marathon on TV, but once I watched it I was hooked.  It's sad that it was canceled after less than one complete year.  I'm glad there was a movie but bringing back the series also, is what I and all the other fans still want, 10 years later.  I'm surprised nobody would pick it up given the rabid and widespread fan support.
0547884591|5.0|This is the third book I've bought from Tim Ferris and what I can say is that he is definitely the best life hacker out there. If you want to live a mundane, 9-5 life, this book may not be for you... unless you are looking to escape that life. Tim teaches how to accelerate your learning and improve your memory through the instrument of teaching us, how to cook. I thoroughly enjoyed this highly readable tome on how to learn essential, inside tricks to improve my life and pursue my dreams and goals, and to live, as Tim puts it, the good life while learning how to cook!!!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This movie is very true to the (unfortunately short-lived) TV series, except that is 2 hours long and with better special effects.  It ties up many loose-ends that were left when the series was truncated and leaves a few that needed to be left untied.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Pretty good. It took a while to get into it. He spent too much time on prison conditions I thought. Once it got started it moved. I liked his other books better.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|The movie has a great cast. The first half of the movie is the best, the second half was just a little stale, but still good. To my surprise, this movie focuses more on wit and less on cussing for its humor.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|a great way to get AMC while Dish was boycotting that channel. Was available by the next morning , no problems
B007FIY3VW|4.0|Does all of the basic tasks for office docs without using up a lot of resources.  Very agile because it does not add features that are seldom used.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Love this tv show. So thrilled to get to see episodes from Season 3 before the season has even ended. Bought the HD version and it was beautiful on my new Kindle Fire. Just thrilled.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|They simply wrecked the Bond personality when they chose Craig to play the part. Craig tries to play the tough guy and it is just pathetic. Bond should have the personality of the previous actors that have played him such as class and that hint of humour.
B004X75RK4|3.0|I like Sandra Bullok but the movie is just OK. It is a movie easy to digest when you are not in the mood for something &#34;too serious&#34;.
B004HD61KE|1.0|I read my library's Kindle edition of this book.This was my first book from this author and the story was so ludicrous that no way could I get lost in it.I only hung in there to see if the author was really going to stick with the Mormon Proselytizing throughout the book,which he does,so is this author Mormon,and do all his books have such a plot?<br /><br />The book was also IMO excessively violent and I did not appreciate the 'F' bombs and other cursing,though scattered.<br /><br />Believe I will be looking for other authors for adventure books.
B008M721MS|5.0|so easy to use very friendly-get the bigger one-youll be glad you did  just a few dollars more  highly rec...
B003V9OCS8|5.0|A fabulous movie on the Eiger.  Normally I don't like movies with subtitles, but this one you almost forgot you were reading along.  It is spellbinding.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I got this for my son who was in Japan for a few years and enjoyed it there.  Now his daughter loves it!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|If nothing else, to the open-minded, the film is at its very least thought-provoking. Without going into what inevitably becomes one of science fiction's most successful franchises, Prometheus was a standalone production that sought to open the debate of the creation of man, without definitively explaining it. It firmly embraces all possibilities, giving validity many if not most scenarios.<br /><br />Honorable mention to Noomi Rapace as the passionate and spiritual (Shaw). A character who sought to flesh out the unanswered questions of creation her religion may have left to question. Michael Fassbender as the mission-minded (David) illustrated how only true talent can remove enough of the &#34;humanity&#34; in the character to make a believable non-living being.<br /><br />The film was beautiful in color, texture and detail. It truly encompassed how the most skilled artists and producers stretch the limits of modern technology. Filmmaking should always raise the bar of expectation in its approach to bridging reality with fantasy. The film is a visual butterfly, evolving into something more stunning to the eye as moments passed.<br /><br />As much as I liked the very concept of the film the scope of the entire endeavor seemed quite oversimplified in some ways. The thought of humans traveling that deep into space was quite grand. Not touching on very real possibilities of sickness, dementia and a host of physical and mental conditions that would have developed from the trip alone ignored reality to some extent. This is not even mentioning how much something like this would really cost.<br /><br />For Sci-Fi fans this one's a thinking person's gem. View it without the intentions of making it what you want it to be. Guns-blazing, alien-swarmed film this is not. But what it is a very cerebral exercise in &#34;What if?&#34;
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is by far one of the most interesting books i have ever read in my life.  Adam Brown's story is so deep.  And it really deserved to be told. It just goes to show you, that a person can come from some of the most darkest times in their life, to become whatever they desire.  With the right amount of willpower.
0062206281|3.0|This book is as good as his previous books but the reason for a lower rating is that the length of the book is not what this writer has done in the previous books about the same story.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Simple five star review, it's accurately at about 3000k, although I prefer my bulbs warmer it's as advertised. I hear no humming, but my lamp has no dimmer. The price was right, and since it's LED I expect it to last for years. The main reason I bought this was that while I like incandescent bulbs they're basically heat lamps, I can touch this one while on and it's barely warm. Not to mention it will pay for itself within a year. The only downside is it's not as bright as my 60 watt, but it's pretty close, and works great for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|At first I did not know minecraft was awsome. But when my brother played the demo I DOWNLODED IT IMIDIETLY trust me 6.99 is WORTH IT
0061906220|5.0|As another reviewer pointed out, the review uptop is very discouraging. As I read the initial story line, I was thinking it would be a great buy for my 4yr old who sometimes seems to get upset about very small things. This would be such a great way to illustrate that one should not get troubled by little problems that come on the way....but to keep moving.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I bought this app when it was the free app of the day.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this app. The story was good, the graphics were pretty, and the challenges were exactly that-- challenging. I have to admit I used the cheats, but mainly because the rooms, or 'screens' as they called it, were hard to find.<br /><br /> I finished in about an hour and a half, and would suggest 13 or older to play this app-- it may frustrate younger players.<br />Other than the ending and the above mentioned problems (rooms and the time it takes to find items) I loved this app. The ending was slightly disappointing, as we don't discover exactly *what* happens to the 'Lost City's or the civilians, if there were any left. But since this is a game, not a book, it's excusable. I loved this app, and I hope you do too.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I enjoyed the book and it kept my interest through out the entire book. At times it was very upsetting so be prepared...I had to put it down several times due to the subject matter of children being murdered.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just like his other books, this one takes you on a fast ride to excitement.  I didn't want to put the book down.
B009WJ2HDS|5.0|Great mood changes within this collection. I only discovered this artist by listing to NPR. It was a fascinating story and the music matced.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|After reading the previous book in this series, which wasn't fantastic, but it kept me interested enough to pick up Reflected in You.<br /><br />What a disappointment. I dislike reading books with characters who I would try to avoid in real life, and between Eve's neediness and Gideon's controlling nature, I found myself despising both of them.  To spoil, let me just say there were so many instances of red flags in this book that I wanted to stage an intervention for fictional characters....Gideon withholding Eva's orgasm to make her admit her anger, his telling her that she doesn't \\"follow orders\\" and the pies de resistance, finding out that he committed cold blooded murder, got away with it and she was grateful to him for doing it just sent me over the edge.  It was one appalling thing after another, and although I liked that Eva got some gumption up and had it out with Gideon's mother, that tiny bit of backbone fizzled when it came to his shenanigans.<br /><br />I will not be following any more of the Crossfire novels.  In fact, I just may try to return this book to the place where I purchased it.
B007N8RULO|5.0|it's a fun way to pass time while waiting for something.<br />works well with no problems so far. I recommend this game.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|I found this book to be full of interesting details about teaching and what is being taught.  The information about morals was very relevant to me.  I had an aha moment when the author discussed how the war on poverty has shifted to the present discussion of \\"if only our schools were doing their job our society would be all right.\\"  I feel that ideas in this book should be discussed and that more people should find ways to act upon them.
B00006JU7T|4.0|I came of age with this movie. Learned to trust myself being the only good guy (even &#34;saint&#34;) among the many bad guys. Pacino may be remembered by many as the cool-head, cold-blooded gangster of Godfather series, but as Serpico he remains my hero as the uncompromising, opera-loving, ballet-dancing, intellectual (also womanizer) who &#34;fixed&#34; the corrupt system.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I liked the game. I could use a guide to better understand some of the characters abilities.I may purchase one if the levels get too difficult.
B007RI56NY|5.0|another great album from train. enjoyed all the songs still listening to them now. if your a train fan then this album is definately a must have.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|Inspiring song with an equally inspiring voice.I'm glad people started recognizing him.I loved the way he tells the story in his song.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|Trial version for a week. Have to pay to use the app after that. I removed it right away. .
1609611543|5.0|For years I've been dealing with acid reflux on a daily baisis.  Several years ago I went on the atkins diet and noticed that it went away, but the diet was just too dificult to maintain.  I've mentioned to several doctors that bread products seem to make my acid reflux worse and they always brush me off and perscribe medications.  I was told by one doctor that once a heart burn sufferer always a heart burn sufferer and I would just have to take medications from now on.  I am a woman in my 50's and my weight just kept going up. I assumed it was due to hormones.  I had cut out the sugar as much as possible, I wasn't eating fried foods and was eating whole grain, and exercising 4 days a week but just couldn't get my weight under control.  After reading the book and going gluten free, my acid reflux is 90 percent better and my weight is down about 8 lbs and that's with no exercise.  I still have to take tums occasionally.  There is gluten in foods that you wouldn't think it's in, so I'm sure some gluten sneaks into my diet from time to time.  I was concerned about not getting enough fiber but I have found that when you cut out the wheat there is more room for fruits and vegetables which can actually have more fiber.  Most of the book talks about why wheat is bad and that can make for a boreing read, but what it has done for my acid reflux and weight,  not to mention how much better I feel, makes it worth reading. It also helps to understand why wheat does what it does.  It's easy to get into a habit of eating too many corn chips and gluten free snacks and that will slow down the weight loss.  If I stick with the way the book says to eat and start my exercise routine again I'm sure I can loose a few more pounds.  It will be interesting the next time I go to the Dr. to see if my cholesterol has gone down.  I give the book 5 stars because it worked for me.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I was very excited to see how the origins on the Alien franchise began. However, there were many questions raised than answered, but it did keep my interest. The movie is beautiful and I'm glad that it wasn't another generic monster movie.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is my first review. I'm not one for many words,but after watching this years ago when it was first released. And 3 or four times since. It is still one of my favorite feel good movies. I'd love to believe it wasn't just a movie.<br /><br />Very good.<br /><br />JG
B00A8ECU24|5.0|its Amazing very well thought out and awesome gameplay. I thought it was going to be a chessey game and boy did it prove me wrong
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I thought he would talk more about his experiences on the other side. That's the whole reason I bought the book. In the end what I learned from his total experience and how the medical world perceives such experiences proved to be just as valuable for me.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I thought this would have the standard \\"rain, waves, birds\\" sounds but the variety is really interesting. It also has a mix and match feature that is fun to play with
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is an unlimited source to links I would have never found otherwise.  I may be perusing the world of pincushions and then I'm off to electrical wall outlets that I never knew existed!  In other words, one may start out on one journey and end up going forty different routes to new experiences.  I highly recommend to all, if nothing else the visuals alone are wonder eye candy.
B007V5CF5K|1.0|Was going great, lot's of fun, THEN..... on of the objects you need is UNDER the menu tab! Can not proceed, game is stuck. If you have a Kindle HD, don't bother!
B007SGM084|1.0|I guess its true the whole world is going to HX in a handbasket.  This was not entertaining reading and I don't need this kind of stuff to stir up my relationships.  Waste of money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so fun and addicting!!...I love it. u should hit that buy button up there. the best part is that its free. who doesn't love free apps!?..BUY IT NOW!!! U KNOW U WANT TOO!! :) &lt;3 &lt;(-_-)&gt;
B002QBS9KE|5.0|Easy to assemble the medium fit good and felt the same as the original I like it very much. buy it
0345803485|1.0|This book is degrading to both men and women. Please think about what you have chosen to endorse by reading this book.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very cool app and i like that you have to unlock the games before being able to play them all it makes it more fun and want to continue playing this game.

B00A0NOF7G|3.0|This is a great little mystery for busy people.  I love the characters and it even has a little bit of romance thrown in. A great book to take to bed when you just want an easy read. Will be looking for the next book for sure.
0385344228|5.0|I loved this book!!  It takes a lot to get my attention from the very beginning and this book did it!  I am recommending this to my book club.  Loved it from beginning to end.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I watch very little television. This is one of the few shows worth watching. And it's about zombies! What more could you ask for? Well... there is that issue with zombie skulls being so thin....
0470449748|5.0|it's great!<br />great book and speed<br />I thought it will take long time on the way, but it's not. It's great and the book like totally new.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was an enjoyable book to read.  I was shocked to learn that the last orphanage of this type was closed as late as the 1990's.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my 5 yr old loves this game I'm typeing on her ipad her name is Hannah kole shes famous here in London her mum an dad are living in a 7 story mansion in school they cull her may but she is addicted too this game she will always play it. she havent aye in 1day alredy she is addicted to 3 stuff 1 direction this game and Christmas games!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down! This was a great story and I just want it to continue! Hoping there will be more chapters....
B0050CJNJ2|2.0|I love this CD but the 7th track does not work.  It plays part of the song but most of it is nothing.  This is one of the first items I am so unhappy about buying from Amazon. I thought I would be safer buying this CD from Amazon but I should have looked into the other sellers more closely.  I should send it back  but I have never had to do that with any other purchase, so that is a new experience. HATE SENDING THINGS BACK IN THE MAIL.  So buyer beware even if you order from Amazon, a name I thought I could trust.
B004NWHVVC|5.0|I can't believe I just found this album, but it's going to be on constant repeat for a long time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun and smooth to play needs more options to make it harder to play , why do I need to write so many words ?
B0071XO8RA|3.0|More than a little depressing but well written. If you enjoyed (?) Lord of the Flies, you might like this one.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Being a child of the 80's, I really enjoyed this book.  It brought back a lot of memories.  I read that it was Ernest Cline's first book, and it's a great first effort.  It does feel like it could use a little polish though, possibly more detailed/descriptive in some areas.  That said, I do believe I'd read other work from the author.<br /><br />[SPOILERS, but not too much information...]<br /><br />While it wouldn't be much of a book if he *didn't* reach his goal, it would have been nice if there was the occasional seed of doubt implanted that would make the reader say &#34;Wait... maybe he's NOT going to make it!&#34;  While the author did put Wade in some bad situations, I never really doubted that he would get himself out of them.  I would have enjoyed some more conflict in regards to the difficulties Wade faced (his incarceration, though planned, seemed all to easy to get out of, just as one example).
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If not exciting, I found this novel to be, as Grisham's often are both thought provoking and very well written.
0062127241|3.0|I am a huge Who fan and found this book to be disappointing.  I suppose I had an image of Townshend built up in my mind that was much more positive than the person in this book.<br /><br />The actual human being often seemed shallow, narcissistic, and callous.  The manner in which he treated his wife and children were appalling.  Throughout the book my overriding emotion was pity for Townshend's family.  I also felt sorry for Roger Daltrey, who appears to be the only sane person in the band.<br /><br />There is some interesting trivia for Who fans, but you have to dig for it.  Townshend seems much more preoccupied with his boats, houses, and affairs than anything to do with the band.  For the most part, he complains about the band being a burden.<br /><br />Overall it's not a bad book, I just wish Townshend had talked more about the band and the music versus his money, boats, houses and bimbos he slept with or chased after.
B0091REZMW|5.0|a lot of fun. some challenges are annoying because the give them at weird times and its had to gets jewels. but I still enjoy playing this game
1609611543|2.0|If one wishes to devote a major part of life to an exclusive diet, this might be the answer.  There are too many variables.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Once into the story I wanted to keep readong until the end. I'd like to read more by this author.
0307352145|4.0|It is wonderful to be recognized as worthy though not wordy.  Wanting to spend time alone is not the same as being depressed nor reclusive.  &#34;Quiet&#34; validates the other 50% of the world that choses to not always express every thought.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|Ian Flemming wrote this particular movie and it includes all the classic \\"Bond\\" elements.<br />Take a pretty girl, a car with gadgets, a Hero and Villains and mix with lots of action.  The<br />fantasy scenes were about the only way Flemming could deal with children being in peril without<br />being too dark about the subject. It's a wonderful romp and you should add it to your collection<br />just to make it complete. It's Bond, it's Disney AND just a little of Gilbert and Sullivan !<br />Don't miss it...
B008FSCNTK|2.0|Of course I understand what you tried to do: Make something different, go back in to jazz history: To Ragtime, Barrelhouse, Honky Tonk, Boogie Woogie and some basic Blues.<br />But the guys in those days were great piano players: Jelly Roll Morton, Earl Hines, Willie \\"The Lion\\" Smith, James Pete Johnson and sometimes great singers too: Thomas \\"Fats\\" Waller!<br />But your stride, boogie woogie and blues is too poor on this album.<br />These styles are difficult and can't be bought by using some upright Honky Tonk piano.<br />Why sings all the tracks?<br />Why go in to country & western?<br />Why not study these old, but great pianists from the past?<br />You had great teachers: Ray Brown, Jimmy Rowles and even the great Oscar Peterson learned you some tricks.<br />But to play like Mary Lou Williams, Meade Lux Lewis or Albert Ammons you got to learn how to play a great boogie woogie, great stride piano or basic blues.<br />If you had mixed singing tracks, with piano tracks, or even organ.<br />Had listened to those Red Hot Mama's and Betty Smith, you could have captured the sounds from the past much better.<br />Maybe you was, what you sing: \\"I'm a little mixed up.\\"<br />Of course we forgive you if you turn to jazz again, even forgive you those stupid \\"sexy\\" photo's, you really don't need that, Diana.<br />Please study those old piano players, those piano styles from the past.<br />Oscar Peterson did all that, and also studied all classic piano.<br />Of course you're no Oscar, but you can learn how to play a fine boogie woogie.<br />Listen also to those great singers/pianists like Fats Waller and Nat \\"King\\"Cole, who were great piano players too.<br />A new great album dedicated to the great and funny Fats Wallers is probably a great idea, since you already did one dedicated to Nat King Cole.<br />What fun it must be to do these great songs like \\"My very good friend the milkman\\", You'r not the only oyster in the stew\\",\\"Serenade for a wealthy lady\\"(instrumental),\\"All that meat and no potatous\\", \\"Your socks don't match\\", \\"The Jitterbug waltz\\", \\"Moppin'and Boppin'\\", \\"Your feet's too big\\" and of course \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\"!<br />This man was a genius, wrote hundred's of songs, and could play some mean piano!<br />So Diana, we still love you, you were a little mixed up.<br />Well that can happen, we are all are looking for your new album. (and maybe Fats is an idea?)<br /><br />Arnold van Kampen, Netherlands.<br />jazz historian, discographer, reviewer, radio host, writer, etc., etc..
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I really enjoy a good, CLEAN action movie.  Yeah, I know, lots of blood and guts.  But---the sex and disgusting language were missing.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|This was a very novel approach and really enjoyable.  The only down side was some of the &#34;modern&#34; values and language.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|These are very talented musicians.  Their remake of pop classics into string instrument versions are stunning.  This CD is a real treat for the ears.  Their rendition of Michael Jackson's &#34;Annie, are you okay?&#34; was even featured on Glee with Santana singing against a Warbler foe.  Absolutely fantastic!
B008JJM88Q|3.0|The concept of this game is brilliant. It was able to get any character I could possibly think of. Even the Bush from Adventure Time, which was unbelievable. However, after about two days, I started thinking of characters even more minor, to give Akinator a challenge. He couldn't get a few of them. The reason why I am disappointed is because when he can't figure out who the character is, he asks you ti type the name of the person. There is no submit button so typing the name into the box is utterly pointless, thus forcing you to skip that step. Refusing to enter the name of your person results in him winning the game, which I thought was unfair because he did not guess the person right and therefore should count as a loss. This issue might only exist the kindle fire, but a game this good should nevertheless work fine on any device. That was my main issue with this app. One other problem is that whenever  I try click the play button, even if there aren't any problems with the wifi, it says there are network problems, and will not let me play the game. Overall, I loved the game a lot initially, but after a while I discovered problems that made the game frustrating. Please make a kindle fire version, or fix the problems.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|I loved the whole sequence, I just got sad because the author died and I can't know Salander's future adventures.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|The best cop TV series ever. I do not like cops shows. The creator made the show resemble real life as much as possible. The DVDs come in a book as part of the collection. The book will not fit neatly in your DVD storage device like regular DVD cases.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|It is very good, I read it very fast and got curious about the next book. I'll definitely buy all the three books.

B00000612Q|4.0|Never A Dull Moment filtered in from the States looking like some long lost hand tinted postcard one may have acquired while walking the boards in Atlantic City on a hot July afternoon ... with the promise of fireworks in the evening.  And while I didn't have the overstuffed wing-chair in Vietnam, I did have a molded plastic one I'd lifted from the mess-tent, covered it with Army blankets topped off with a silk robe I purchased at the PX, and by a sheer act of unintended suggestion, found myself with a deep exhale, adopting the same repose of exhaustion as Mr. Stewart ... and we would be having fireworks this evening, like it or not, we had them every evening.<br /><br />The needle found the groove, and by the time \\"You Wear It Well\\" fanned out from my small speakers, I was wishing I were stoned.  By the time \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" ended ... I was ... leaving me liquid and loose.  I bowed at the waist, pretended to pick up a microphone from the floor, and like a freight train rolling down the tracks, I was belting out \\"Twistin' The Night Away,\\" as strobing flares signaled a lockdown of the base.  I loved this album, it was like Motown meets the U.K. meets rock n' roll, with songs about Italian girls, loss, heartache, and prayers, all topped with an iconic American classic to let you know that when nothing is going your way, and I mean nothing ... you can always get up and dance the night away.<br /><br />I'll admit to having a falling out with Mr. Stewart over the years, but he did give me Gasoline Alley along with Never A Dull Moment.  And if no one is listening, you might even catch me cuing up Atlantic Crossing, just to bathe in the memories of rock n' roll at its very best.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B004LSJCJM|3.0|There are some artist that forever have me banging my head against the wall, feeling that I should be down on my knees, raising a ceremonial guitar to the heavens in prayer, thanking the guitar gods that on the third day I was blessed with the sense of hearing ... instead of sitting here trying to figure out why I'm deleting half the tracks on this, the tenth outing in as many years from Joe Bonamassa.<br /><br />There are those who claim Dust Bowl is his strongest release to date, and while I can make that argument as well, that still leaves half the songs on the cutting room floor as far as I'm concerned ... though I will say that those remaining certainly are well worth your time.  This is probably one of the most cinematic albums I've ever heard from Joe, it's full of gritty visionary lyrics that counterbalance his slow driving blues, jangling guitars, and the accelerating Hammond, one that stands toe to toe with a kicking Slide, one that will remind you of what the southern States have brought to both rock n' roll and the blues.  And still I sit here, convinced that half the songs just don't work for me.<br /><br />The exceptions are \\"Dust Bowl,\\" which has been offered as a free download, and has been shaded with strat guitar tones layered to create a western soundtrack that's just crying to be used in the TV series \\"Justified,\\" and has been riding shotgun with me as I traveled through New Mexico.  \\"Tennessee Plates\\" is a roadhouse knockout sung by John Haitt, and is sure to have you downing that last shot before splintering the dance floor.  \\"Black Lung Heartache\\" is one of the best tracks on the album, a stoner's dream with lustful guitar solos that will leave you breathless. \\"Sweet Rowena\\" was penned and sung by Vince Gill who spars completely stolen signature B.B. King guitar licks with Joe, and rises to what sounds like a festive long lost Allman Brothers track.  And still, I sit here willing to dismiss the rest of the album.<br /><br />As with the afore mentioned B.B. King, Joe has finally reached that stage of his career where his personal signature moves shine through bright as the sun, and it's a true pleasure to hear him so effortlessly collaborating with other great musicians.  There's a feeling of satisfaction on Dust Bowl that comes from relentlessly touring and nonstop playing, where he finds a flawless groove and shows it off like a new penny.  His timing and phrasing are right on cue, he's no longer just an amazing guitar player, he's a musical force to be reckoned with, and in his relaxed manner, he seems very pleased to be doing just what he's doing ... and still, I sit here willing to toss out half the tracks on this great release for some reason that I may never figure out.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerentioned B.B.

B004HGBUVG|5.0|I don't have a problem with Lucinda William, though having said that, I can certainly see where others may.  I don't believe that fans would be as hard on her and her material had it come from self-destructive artists like Gram Parsons, or Townes Van Zandt ... after all, Lucinda's been as self-destructive as any of them, she's just managed to survive.  Her music is often raw, certainly deeply felt, and even at its worst, it's straight from the heart.  Lucinda's put out ten albums, that's a huge body of work, not to mention her songwriting credits on other's releases.  Even the great Bob Dylan only managed to put out four amazingly perfect albums, and they came out right in a row, a natural progression, before he felt that he'd lost his muse.  But I'm getting ahead of myself, with the point being that I've always edited the work of Lucinda Williams, taken the songs that rolled though my head like thunderstorms, memorized the ones that set my feet to dancing on the lonely open road, and cried over the ones that broke my heart.  No one says that I've gotta dig every song, sometimes just one song, the right one, is all that I need ... Lucinda Williams is that kind of artist.<br /><br />\\"Blessed\\" is an entirely different story, \\"Blessed,\\" as uncomfortable as the title is for me, certainly is [in that special way].  This is no doubt the most elegant sophisticated album she's brought to the table, full of alternative country images, ringing guitars, gentle blues, and one bone numbing shiver after another.  Much of that is in part due to Don Was, who has a knack for finding the essence [no pun intended],  and allowing it to flower with a richness unimagined ... though to her credit, I would contend that this is just how Lucinda heard it in her head.<br /><br />Sadly this is the album that is going to bring Lucinda William back into the fold, she's gonna be showered with praise, her catalog will be revisited, and \\"Blessed\\" will become the album to which all of her future releases are measured.  So, when the crowd thins out again, the lights dim, and I'm laying in bed on a hot summer night, beads of sweat lacing my hair, and \\"Soldier's Song\\" faintly floating from the speakers, I'll smile, happy that she's touched me this deeply.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslereases are measured.

0553582038|4.0|Most fans of fantasy have probably fantasized about living in their favorite fantasy world be it Middle-Earth or Narnia where you can talk to animals hang out with elves and ride on unicorns a world where if you are a good and just person no harm can come to you. Westoros is not one of those worlds it is a scary place where bad things happen to good people. I belive that is the appeal of this series for so many people this world is just so real and while it scares the hell out of me I enjoy spending time in it.<br />While I did enjoy this book, it is my least favorite of the series so far. At times I found it a bit slow and I was a little disappointed that some of the point of views from some of the characters wasn't there.<br />Now I understand that this book was too long and had to be divided into two seperate books and perhaps after I read \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" I might enjoy this book more. I got into this series late already five books were written so after reading the fourth book I could jump into the fifth book right away if I choose to, I would be going nuts if I had to wait a couple of years to read the next installment. That being said I will start the fifth book soon ( there are two other books that I would like to read first) but after that I guess I will join the Millions of fans that have to wait for part six, and while I dread having a long wait the anticipation will hopefully make the book that much better.<br />Now back to \\"A Feast For Crows\\" while not to many new characters are introduced that to me was a good thing since there are so many characters already, I found the ending to be very good it was great to see some characters finally get what the deserve.
B004L79VUI|5.0|Robbie Robertson is an odd sort of fellow, all but disappearing from the accepted music scene.  While his mates [and I use the term `mates' carefully because his fallout with his old band is the stuff of legend] were reshaping their careers on stage and in the studio, Robbie was content to work on soundtracks [Matin Scorsese], produced several artists [including Neil Diamond], has done a great deal of other music related work as a `Suite' for the industry, and released but a mere handful of solo albums in all these years, this being his fifth.  I have no idea how he became known as the voice of the band, other than the fact that one might say he was the `good looking' member, or that he was the front and center guitarist.  While he certainly was a fine guitarist, he sang but one song on the first Band album, and I don't believe that he sang at all on the second ... matter of fact, during the Last Waltz they actually turned his microphone off.<br /><br />The Band was a collective effort, everyone had talent, everyone contributed, but Robbie remembered what his old friend The Hawk had said, and that was to get those song writing credits.  I fully realize this is history, but it's important ... while the rest of The Band was more than happy to be touring, releasing an album, and generally succeeding at their craft, Robbie had an eye that was looking farther down the road, figuring that someone's name needed to be listed on the credits, and if no one else cared, he did.  And to that end, when some of his `mates' bottomed out, or could no longer carry on, he was happy to step in and purchase their share of The Band's material; rather than just reaching out as a friend and brother to lend a helping hand.  To this day, Levon is the only hold out, and has nothing to do with the man.<br /><br />\\"How To Become Clairvoyant\\" is the title of Robertson's new release, which is pretty funny when you think about it, because he's not, neither is the album, especially when the man who would like to think of himself as the voice and words of The Band, has the most success with an instrumental ... though with the likes of Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Trent Reznor, and Tom Morello, sitting behind the studio glass, if he couldn't come up with an least an instrumental, there's no reason on earth for him to strap on his spurs every morning.  Honestly, all Goldmine could manage to come up with was \\"A deeply personal collection of 12 tunes, bolstered by a historic collective.\\"  Rolling Stone manages to muster an off-beat tail that says nothing, perhaps because there's nothing to say, \\"When The Night Was Young, this pretty, wistful reminiscence finds the former Band man longing for the days hen he hung out with card sharks and grifters, and thought he could change the world.\\"<br /><br />William Faulkner once said that \\"the past is never dead, that in fact, it's not even past.\\"  To that, allow me to say that for Robbie Robertson, his past is truly over, all but two of his bandmates are dead, and what's going on here has nothing to do with those heady nights of blue haze and kitchen jams that stocked the fire, this is just Robertson capitalizing on a distant dream, without which, this record would be dismissed with the wave of a hand ... which is pretty much just what's happened.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Keslerwould like to think of himself as the voice and words of The Band, has the most success with an instrumental ... though with the likes of Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, Trent Reznor, and Tom Morello, sitting behind the studio glass, if he couldn't come up with an least an instrumental, there's no reason on earth for him to strap on his spurs every morning.

B009J2VQSK|3.0|Brubeck, Alabama Shakes and Rare Earth on one disc - Must work better on the screen<br /><br />At the time I'm posting this review I have not yet seen this film, so I'm basing my review on the CD alone. Like \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", \\"Dirty Dancing\\" and \\"Footloose\\", Director David O. Russell uses commercial recordings - new and old - to change the moods in the film. (This I garnered from a few reviews of the film.). while he uses excerpts of 24 different records in the film, this album includes 12 of them, plus the \\"Title Theme\\" and \\"Walking Home\\" by composer Danny Elfman. (There is a separate CD of Elfman's music score, which I haven't heard.).<br /><br />To say the music here is \\"eclectic\\" is an understatement. Two classic Dave Brubeck Quartet tracks (\\"Unsquare Dance\\" from the legendary \\"Time Out\\" album and \\"Maria\\") mash up with \\"Hey Big Brother\\" by the 60s psychadelic band Rare Earth and the Alabama Shakes' \\"Always Alright\\", Jessie J's title song and Les Paul and Mary Ford's 50s Hawaiian-influenced \\"Moon of Manakoora\\". Oh, did I forget to mention Bobby Pickett's 2-minute seasonal hit \\"Monster Mash\\", done here in a 3 ½ minute version by a group named CrabCorps?<br /><br />Maybe the album producers were hoping that Jessie J and Alt-J fans would discover Brubeck, Paul and Ford (I'm sure they already know Stevie Wonder, whose \\"My Cherie Amour\\" is among the tracks), but I doubt it. There's a 12 page booklet included, but - except for two pages with the music credits - it's just photos from the film.<br /><br />I like Elfman's two tracks (and I love Brubeck, but have those recordings - along with the Johnny Cash/Bob Dylan duet - on other albums) but the rest is just too varied for most listeners. Maybe the songs work on the screen as excerpts but they didn't work for me in one package.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00005JLO2|3.0|Starts off slow and lacks plot development, but gets interesting once the main character begins his desert journey.  Climax is good.  Post climax stinks.  Kate Hudson is awful as always.  Who decided she was hot?  Not me.  Fast forward over the slow parts at the beginning and you will see a decent movie.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I just got this movie, me and the kids really enjoy it. This movie shipped really fast, before promised delivery date. I got this on cyber Monday for 3.99 plus 2.95 shipping. I couldn't beat it, but it's well worth the 14.99 regular price. The story is cute. The colors are so bright. I have a 2 and 3 year old and it keeps their attention. They sing along with the songs. It's a cute movie with a good story line. I'd recommend this movie for anyone with kids.
0316069434|5.0|Have you ever read a book that you are enjoying and hate for it to end? I've had too many to count and when that happens I tend to slow down and read only a few chapters or pages a day knowing that the book I'm enjoying will end far too soon. Again, Michael Connelly has written another great mystery/thriller with Harry Bosch whose main purpose in life is to help bring justice for those who have died. His life is filled with unsolved cases and Bosch, who apparently only has FOUR more years in the LAPD in the unsolved case division knows that every case is important and is a part of his very existence.<br /><br />This time, Harry Bosch and his partner David Chu, have a case of a Danish woman who was found dead during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. What was she doing in the middle of those riots? A photojournalist from Europe dead with no real clues. Only a file full of notes and suspects. These are the cases that Harry Bosch thrives on and in this book he needs that \\"Black Box\\" to help him put together the clues to solve this case even if it's not politcally correct and even if his supervisor thinks Bosch abuses the system to solve cases. The case begins to pick up steam and Bosch begins to slowly put a puzzle together like no other LAPD detective.<br /><br />What I have loved about Connelly's books is that scenes are real. The characters are real. The moments in Bosch's life with his daughter seem real. The burden that Harry Bosch feels about those unsolved cases weighs on him and ties him down to spending his life trying to help bring peace to those who died and even to himself if he can find the killer(s). Harry Bosch has his flaws and they are evident and that is what makes him readable. He is one of us. He is a person bent on doing the right thing even if the politics and the bureuacracy try to prevent him from doing so.<br /><br />This is apparently Michael Connelly's 25th book. I can only hope that he has at least 25 more books in store for us for many years to come. Harry Bosch, Mickey Haller, Cassie Black (from the great \\"Void Moon\\" novel) and his other characters have stories to tell and I want to read those stories.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Connelly.

B002LFCPLO|4.0|Jim Carey did an excellent acting job without all the funny face smart cracking silly plots that where so prevelent in his other roles.  The intro scenes to the movie had me saying whaaat? Very stange and interesting story about a coupling that ran into trouble had intervention from a doctor and staff to wipe their minds clean from all memories of each other.  The story moves back and forth in the time they spent together and ended where it begsn.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The walking dead season one,two and the susspenful action packed to date third sesaon.This show without a doubt completly flips me,the nail biting episodes on season three is non stop.The ongoing struggles of rick's group surviving the best they can in a zombie world plagued against humans on their dark sides.The writing and direction and special effects make this truly magnificent for a tv show of this caliber.The only drawback is many characters we grow to love begin to die throughout the seasons which in turn introduces new characters.Gut wrenching and bold The Walking Dead takes us on a roller coaster ride into the unknown of despair and hope.This show deserves a season 4 and beyond for its honesty of ourselves in deperate need to keep our sanity intact.The Walking Dead is an intelligent horror tv show that is destined to be a future classic,I thank the entire cast,film crew,directors,and all asscociated in giving us perhaps may be one of the greatest tv shows ever made.......

I have read this book a number of times over the years and never get tired of the characters and the story.

0547884591|5.0|As I counted down the days until I received my book, I was fantasizing about the different learning goals I had in mind.  My intent was to read nothing more the the \\"Meta-Learning\\" section.  But as I started reading I realized this book is far more useful, and well written than I had imaged.
B008NEVPCC|2.0|It used to be that singers sounded better with lots of beats behind them, now, many of them seem to sound better acoustic, like Rita Ora. Rita Ora is killer with just an acoustic guitar backing her and little else. Cher gives me that same feeling. Her voice and style comes alive when singing acoustic, it's strange and yet you love it at the same time. Her more popular songs are good with heavy production, but the other songs turn to crap. Swagger Jagger is all-around horrible, as are many others. This simply does not seem like the same girl from X-Factor. Maybe she was fake on the show, or maybe she's fake now, but either way, something is off somewhere. I personally believe that she was \\"real\\" on the show, and is now taking on a less than authentic persona. She's talented, can't understand why the people behind her insist on the big-eyed-babydoll act. On the X-Factor, she was no big-eyed-babydoll. Look at her first audition, she was nervous and raw but so genuine. What you get now is a sort of manufactured-baby-voiced strangeness even in interviews. Perhaps on her second release they will do something less contrived? She reminds me a lot of the Barbie Girl singer Lene from Aqua, my mother used to love that group; they were quite gimmicky as well. I do so hope that Cher's unique talents are not wasted on gimmicks in the future, and that somebody will think again before smearing her face in caked on makeup in her videos and photo shoots.
B003V1WTMM|4.0|I almost gave up on this book mid-way. It started to really drag in the middle with what I thought was WAY too much detail about the intricacies of the lives and inner thoughts of the three sisters - Percy and Saffy in particular. I stuck with it, though, and I'm glad I did. There were several story lines going and they all wrapped up nicely - and in some cases surprisingly - in the end. Even though all the exhaustive detail was a bit much for me, I did feel like I truly understood the characters and their motivations. This a brilliant portrayal of a seriously dysfunctional and ultimately very sad family. Kate Morton is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading more of her work.

B001KVZ6HK|1.0|I heard many great reviews about this movie over the summer of 2012.  Decided to buy this and expected a fun evening enjoying a great action movie.. Boy.. was I wrong...<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that it's dumb action, not smart action.  You can make a smart action movie like the original Terminator or Captain America - the first Avenger... or you can create this junk.  Throwing together a bunch of mindless action scenes and hoping that people are overwhelmed.<br /><br />It boggles my mind how this movie did so well in box office.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|It's been years since I first saw Life of Pi in a library, and since then I've wanted badly to read it. The movie set me in motion: I just HAD to read the book before going to a theater.<br /><br />Well, it was worth the wait. What a ride!<br /><br />I expected many things in this book, but what really took me by surprise was that there's so much more than I imagined in its pages. One could think that the story only picks up after Pi sets sail and goes into the ocean, but no: the footing in the land is firm and the story never drops the ball. I laughed, I cried, I almost puked and felt a range of emotions that made me feel almost like a castaway in the middle of the Pacific when I was finished. There are so many things fantastic in Life of Pi, from his name to his mighty ordeal, that it's close to reading a dream, one that stays with you after you wake up. At some points the narrative is a little dull, but isn't the sea as calm and still as a mirror, sometimes?<br /><br />In my book of \\"last phrases\\" (the best finishing worlds in novels), this one is placed among the best. You finish the journey with a sense of satisfaction and a mind so blown away that you'll never be able to gather all the pieces again. Highly recommended: it made me think of the boat I'm riding in life (as we all are) and the animals riding with me.

They should just leave me alone.<br /><br />the prompts are so ubiquitous that when I turned my back this morning, my 3 year old managed to spend 8 dollars in short order.

B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Continuation of my most fave  TV series!  No more waiting for reruns that might run whenever.  Who needs SyFy anymore.
B007HACDLK|5.0|loved this book and the return of the peerless mitch rapp.  flynn developed rapp to his most interesting and multi faceted level yet. i am a huge fan of all flynns work but found myself renewed in my admiration of rapp and the intelligence field through flynns absorbing prose. so happy to see so many of the previous characters return in this novel...especially stan. keep thrilling us mr. flynn!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this game has almost exactly the same script as Minecraft. the textures are different, &agrave;nd they added a few things, but the rest of the script was the same. Do not buy the full version! it is illeagal for someone to try to make money off of this sort of program.
B000209ZAE|5.0|you ask me too much and  I' send my short opinion  very good and I like to werk with it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was sceptical about buying this game but. it paid off but there was one problem... how do you blow up the Tnt?
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  This bit of dark humor is the best thing I've read in months.  Would recommend it if you like your humor on the dry side.  But count you're going to stay up late reading it until you're done.

B005HJU7HA|4.0|Sherlock is still the best detective!  I like the different TV and movie versions, but the written word is still the best.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|watched it already. great movie, great shipping speed. if it would only get out of the case and put itself in my blu ray player.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|wonderfull Blu Ray Edition - in french too . . . . . . . . . . . .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|best game. I have played for a while 'although I think it should have more upgrades. '<br />I gave it five stars.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of the best holiday movies ever made. Great cast of actors. Its a family tradition to watch this during the holidays. I have a old VHS copy that is worn out, and a DVD. Now I have a Blue-ray copy. Can't wait to sit down with the family to watch it several times over the holiday. Last year I purchased the moose mugs to drink my eggnog in. When I decorate the house with lights my wife always says you would make Sparky proud.
0811875040|5.0|The reviews on this book are extremely mixed, and I was torn as to whether I should give the book a chance. I purchased it mid 2012, and I'm not sure which revision of it I have. I have had nothing but extreme success with the recipes in this book. I enjoy baking, and I enjoy recipes that are more detailed and extravagant than your everyday cookie or cake. Tartine was previously my go to book for special cakes, and Miette is now on the shelf right next to it. I love baking the smaller sized cakes. For all the work that goes into making them, it's nice to have an extra cake to put in the freezer for later (each cake recipe makes 2x 6'' cakes).<br />I have made the white cake, yellow cake, chocolate cake, buttercream frosting, and chocolate ganache. The chocolate cake is loved by everyone I make it for. I've made the chocolate chip cookies, brownies, and caramel. I have had some pretty big failures with other caramel recipes, and this recipe has worked perfectly on 3 different occasions for me.<br />If you like to bake and enjoy a few extra steps while doing it, buy this book. The only complaint I have is that the tone of this book is a little stuffy. I'm not an exact baker all the time, but the recipes have all turned out so well that I can overlook the persnickety tone.
B007X15GRQ|2.0|First off I LOVE Markie Mark !!!  He is a great actor but this one just did not do it for me and did not keep me engaged to sit through it :-(
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Compelling. Exciting. Well-acted. It sure doesn't hurt to have Morena baccarin on the show. Can't wait to see season 2.
B0046B4VXQ|5.0|Another one I wanted my kids to see...they told me at the end &#34;Mom that wasn't scary&#34;...although I screamed when the hand popped up...duhhh I knew it was coming but screamed anyways.....they got a laugh out of mom that night
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|does exactly what I need it to do.  great app.  big numbers and easy to read and use.  a calculator the size of your kindle.
B002LBU7BS|5.0|Never saw the movie yet BUT I love the soundtrack, through the trees is one of my favorite songs from this. A win win situation to where my daughter and I can both listen to it. I bought the downloaded version and synced to my Zune.....love it!
B007UXSPK2|3.0|It is a good movie to watch if you are alone and you need to something that distract you from your reality.  It is getting far away from the old MI TV series but this is the state of affairs of SPY movie, I guess.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Lost my interest 25 minutes into the film...boring and boring...sorry I wasted my money on this one. Even the kids got up from family movie night to do something else....:-(
B0090NNQX6|5.0|At first, I didn't care too much the CD because I was so used to his other songs from his first two CDs. They were very complex and beautifully written songs. I finally adjusted to his new style in this CD and now I love it all. In an interview, he described the Origin of Love as being simplified and not as layered as his past CDs. It's a perfect way to describe this CD. It's a bit more like modern pop though. If you liked Mika's style of pop in his previous CDs, it might also take a bit to enjoy the Origin of Love. At the end of the day, it's Mika. So if you love him as much as I do, you'll enjoy the CD.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|2 beautiful ladies and a handsome beau....made for a good family movie with some adventure and darkness. Cinematography very good with the aging process...very believable.
B003H8WSLQ|5.0|We all know there are a million indie bands out there. Some do the genre's hype justice and some just sound like every other band thats ever been popular. Foals \\"Total Life Forever\\" is one of those album's you find in the sea of indie music. The album start off perfectly with not one but 4 excellent top notch songs \\"blue blood\\",\\"Miami\\",\\"total life forever\\", and my favorite track \\"black gold\\".  Then we slow things down a bit with the epic, airy track \\"spanish sahara\\". Then kicks in a bit of a fun track \\"This orient\\". Probably my least favorite track on the album. \\"after glow\\" is next and it has a slow start but once it gets going its quite a great song.Then the album starts to simmer down a bit but in a beautiful way with \\"Alabaster\\",\\"2trees\\" and another one of my favorite tracks \\"what remains\\" which really ends the album perfectly. This album is really worth the money despite what a couple people have said on here.
B007SGM084|3.0|I read this trilogy because it seemed like the thing to do,  but I have no interest in seeing this on the big screen.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works well on my Kinle Fire HD and on the wifes Kindle 1st generation Fire<br />It wont let me win every time... :(
B001YB29HG|4.0|We absolutely fell in love with this movie on Netflix! For awhile, they took it off and we were heart broken! I am very excited to be gifting this to my boyfriend! We finally have a hard-copy!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|well i have to say is that its pretty cool for an app on the kindle fire and its just like angry birds but its the pigs turn to win so if I were you I would get it now
B008RYN44U|4.0|I don't really buy albums anymore but I love No Doubt, so I had to get it.  Me and my daughter love to sing their songs in the car.  I like their ska style.
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|As a mother I was appalled this movie was rated PG. It was a good movie (but should be rated PG13) I can't believe I let my 3 and 6 year old watch it!!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It dose all the tints I need it to do.even for a person like me  that is compely computer stuped I don't know what else to say.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Having read the whole trilogy just to see if there was any reason for the books to exist other than to titillate the reader, I found none.  The story is just an excuse for periodic sex episodes which are repetitive and hard to buy into.  A waste of time
0385523912|5.0|This book moved me to tears.  It strips away the propaganda and the lies and reveals the horror of the real lives of average North Koreans who have become the expendable servants of the brutal Communist regime which has enslaved them.<br /><br />Young children in school are forced to memorize the phrase, &#34;There is nothing to envy&#34; as they literally starve to death in their classrooms.  They have no food.  The money which could save them is lavished on the military and nuclear weapons. Those at the top, politically or militarily, thrive while untold numbers die.<br /><br />This book is harsh, but tells a necessary truth.  It is not fiction.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel was incredibly absorbing, and although you know how it is likely to turn out, there is enough suspense to keep you thoroughly absorbed
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very attractive presentation and works exactly as described.  I am using this on my new Kindle HD 8.9 and recommend it highly.
B006VA57CY|5.0|Amazing historical accuracy and room for education, beautiful costumes, great depth of characters- in another time but dealing with social issues that prevail today.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Best solitaire app out there! Runs smooth and allows the right options. Works the same consistently on Droid and iOS.
B00A5052YE|2.0|I don't know what is is about Alicia's vocals lately that have been not rubbing me the right way, but I've gotta say that I'm not loving or even liking this new album.  I'm really disappointed because I bought three hard copies, one for me and the other two as gifts for my sisters.  Not one of us has really gotten into this cd.  I will say that my baby sister adores Listen to Your Heart and plays it non-stop.  I can't really say that there's even one song that I'm crazy about; they just all seem ok.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I have a couple Invicta watches and these are Great time pieces that have a good weight to them and a classic look. All around Great watches.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I got minecraft and my brother on a kindle fire made this really cool level .I copied it .and when I went to play it .half of the house was there and suddenly<br />disapered. it took him 3 weeks to make! by the way this was on creative. can you fix this glitch please!!!!!!!!!!!
0345529057|5.0|I've not watched any of the HBO series yet, but have plenty of friend who like both the series and the books. I'm almost at the end of this set, and I can't even express how awesome it is! I never thought I'd be pulled into a Medieval story line, but I've been swayed by Mr. Martin! If you like epic stories, with lots of political intrigue, action and twists-and-turns, you'll love the Song of Ice and Fire series.
B000AAF1U4|4.0|Easily, one of the funniest Disney movies made. David Space and John Goodman’s acting in the movie was fantastic. I like Goodman as an actor and is one of the funniest.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I absolutely love putting puzzles together using this app!! One of the things that I appreciate is how the puzzle pieces are sorted for you. Recently, I discovered that if you click the middle button, you get to work with just the edge pieces. Once the edge is assembled, you click again and the rest of the pieces are there! I love the fact that the pieces are presented in the position they go into the puzzle. So much time is spent sorting puzzle pieces...it is a welcome relief to have it done for you! (There is a &quot;rotate pieces&quot; option if you prefer a challenge!) Another thing I love about this app is...no lost or missing pieces!! I have 3 cats...enough said! I can't think of a way that this app could be improved!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed every minute of this book.  From the descriptive writing to the twists and turns of the plot, I felt entertained and connected.<br /><br />I loved, loved, loved the way this book was written as it touched my every emotion.  I had a deep sense of the pain, sadness, joy, warmth and hopelessness of the characters.<br /><br />Definitely 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|3.99?  Are you kidding? Great price for a great movie any day!!  My classroom kids love this movie and will watch it during Dr. Suess week.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Well-done scenario that gave verisimilitude. Populated with some interesting characters. I don't expect the movie to be anything like the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Surprisingly good. For a hop on the band wagon book the masses have taste; this is not only a good read but also thought provoking. Reminds me of Ray Bradbury.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I recently started watching reruns of this show on TV & quickly got hooked so I bought this season 4 pk. The characters are so great & there is a real chemistry within the cast that makes this very funny show well worth watching. I love the idea of skinny packaging so you can get an entire season in 1 slim case. It's a real space saver.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I truly enjoy pinterest! I am totally addicted! BUT how come I cant ever buy anything because it is always sold out....I guess I will keep trying and trying. but I love all of the ideas I get from the site
0547569653|2.0|I admire Scott and his incredible running success. I'm a vegetarian and have run dozens of marathons and ultras up to 100 miles. I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't. The recipes are great, some of the stories are interesting and there's a few good quotables, but otherwise the book is sad, aimless, and hopeless. I appreciate that Scott is honest, lets his guard down, and shares his weaknesses, but in the end there's no hope, no redemption, no obvious joy.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This was a very good story. Never thought about how the idea of father time come about. This was a good story.I hope that it Chaim goes some desperate souls lofe
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I was looking forward to this app. But on my New Kindle Fire HD, it got through screen two on the initial narrative screens and died every time. I had reinstalled to no avail. Others reported the same issue. The authors have fixed most of the issues, the only problem is that when you ask for hints, the app hard waits and times out. If you tell it to wait, it always succeeds. Not a bad app, but not five stars. there is the one semi bug, and you have to save five stars for [[ASIN:B009MCRHH6 World of Goo]].
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I bought this movie because I never had a chance to watch it in the theaters and I really liked Ridley Scott's previous work. I came into this movie thinking that it would be similar to Alien because this film is set in the same fictional world, but after watching it I can say that not all Alien fans will be satisfied by Prometheus. Although this film really has no similarities to Alien it is still a great movie that really combines great cinematography, Special effects, and visuals. The acting was great especially on the part of Noomi Rapace, but I do think that Charlize Theron gave only an okay preformance. The story could have progressed more but I guess the next film may do that. Overall the movie is great, but again don't expect this to be like any of Scott's previous work.
0762439009|2.0|I have come to hold Jeff Bridges in high regards. He's done a fantastic job on several movies. I'm particularly happy with his performance in the remake of True Grit and his work in The Big Lewbowski as the title character \\"The Dude\\"<br /><br />I'll not talk about the movie other than saying its a great comedy. It stars Bridges and John Goodman as bowling partners with a delimma a to solve. Great music throughout the film.<br /><br />If you watch the move you'll learn the significance of what follows:<br />I have three Lewbowski t shirts. 1.  The Dude Abides 2. Mark it a Zero, You're in for a World of Pain, and finally 4. Calmer than you are.<br /><br />This kit has a nice coffee mug. I like the included mousepad which has the phrase \\"It Ties The Desk Together\\". The mousepad is a play on a reoccurring phrase in the move \\"The Rug Really Tied the Room Togther\\".<br /><br />IMPORTANT: THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE A COPY OF THE MOVIE.<br /><br />THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE A DVD COPY OF THE MOVIE<br /><br />If you liked any of the Cohnen brothers work you like this.<br /><br />In my honest opinion Bridges and Goodman engage in some of the most witty dialog in movie history. Goodman at his best.<br /><br />Julienne More, Phillip Semore Hoffman, and Stve Buscemi help bring it home. Buy it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What can be said for having the weather at your fingertips, 24/7? Now I know if I need an umbrella or not.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addicting it gets very tough but that keeps you engaged and it makes you want to keep on playing it. :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice to have a quiet, comforting game available at any time of the day. A relaxing game to play !!!!!!!!!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a well manufactured game, fun to play. Play time is just right, leaving you eager for the next game.
B0086HGW42|5.0|It's hard to believe this is a debut album! Because this guy is good! It's one of the few albums that I can listen to from start to finish, and then start it all over again. I never get tired of hearing him.<br /><br />I'd heard \\"A Team\\" on the radio several months ago and thought it was pretty good, but didn't give it much more thought than that. Then while I was browsing videos by other artists I liked, I noticed \\"Give Me Love\\" was recommended off to the side. I literally couldn't believe this music was coming from this boy's mouth!! Well, I'm a believer now!<br /><br />It's clear that Ed Sheeran has been making music for a long time, despite his young age. His style and lyrics are very unique, and yet he never fails to please the listener's ears. The sounds on the album range from folk to funk. From blues to indie. Even some hip hop! I gain more appreciation for his talent every time I listen to the album. Definitely a great purchase!<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|Hmmm Maybe it was just the way she kicked the chair so that it landed like that against the wall
B00A6PD8RQ|1.0|I give this NO stars!! I had to do 1 tho to submit my review(SADLY)Not for children! She's very disrespectful, tons of WITCHCRAFT which my children shall not see or participate. It's all scary--not really funny at all! Very serious and adult like! Horrified at Disneys idea of family and children with this movie! Such a shocker! my kids when we started watching cried and begged to turn off because it was so scary!! Would never have in my home or recommend to buy. What a disappointment and let down with Disney! Parets MUST watch first--PLEASE CONSIDER!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|One of the best heart felt movies around !! ca watch over and over again and the 3D is awesome!
B0042UEU8M|5.0|This is a great movie, good for the whole family, my daughter who is 9 years old enjoyed this movie very much.
0593070631|5.0|The product was in excellent shape and nothing was damaged in shipping. This is exactly what I ordered and I love it. It was delivered within the estimated time, although I personally wish there was a tracking number on my order. However the number does not effect my review or the quality of service I recieved.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|So much content for so little money! Things really are getting better for the consumer. I don't have a 3D tv, but I know I will someday, so why not get the big one.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Great characters and black comedy. The interwoven historical characters add to the comedy and could change history as we know it.
B005LAIHE0|2.0|This had the potential to be a good movie, but the reliance on quite a bit sophomoric, bathroom humor really brought it down.  There were long stretches that were just utterly boring.  Combine this with a predictable script, it was a big disappointment.  I had higher hopes from a movie with Jason Segel and Emily Blunt.
B009HEMW4W|2.0|I didn't have time to go see it in the theater so I was excited when it came up for purchase.  What a disappointment.  Gathered up the kids and the popcorn then fell asleep twice watching it.  Save your money for something else.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I love anything Rod Stewart does, but this album is wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone because it's not just for the holiday listening.
B000I8G5NA|3.0|Not as good as the first one, Laura Flynn makes a good bad girl but the plot's not as good.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I miss the Rush of old, but this is the best album they've put out in quite some time.  I'd say the best since Test For Echo.  There's some good, hard rocking on it.  Can't wait to see them again at Red Rocks.
B000KI6286|5.0|Great movie and renting and viewing was super easy. I will be renting movies here again for sure because the selection is nice
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun solitaire game to pass the time. I find that I open it to play a quick game &amp; don't want to stop!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It is a great page turner! John Grisham once again does not disappoint.  Interesting, intriguing, easy to read.  I enjoyed it.
B001FB55L2|4.0|A MEDIOCRE movie, with the exception of TOBEY MAGUIRE'S PERFORMANCE. He got that SINISTER, CRAZY look down PERFECTLY. I thought he was FABULOUS. Not enough to carry the movie, but I was genuinely surprised by how totally GREAT he was in this role. See it if you want. I gave this movie 4 stars based solely on MAGUIRE'S STELLAR performance.
0785163174|5.0|For the record, it has been years since the comic world has seen perfection. Avengers vs. X-Men is not perfect, nor was Justice, Kingdom Come, Final Crisis, Watchmen, Batman Year One, Hush, Civil War, Secret Invasion, Secret Wars, Crisis on Infinite Earths or the many other graphic novels that have given all of us many hours of enjoyment. What this story is, is a work of art, like the rest of the other titles I have mentioned, along with countless others that I have not. Some stories catch lightning in a bottle, others are rolling thunder, this one just happens to be rolling thunder. Enjoy it, or not, its your choice. This story and the creative team behind it have done an excellent job at constructing another classic that many of us will be able to enjoy for years to come. I am thankful for their efforts, I for one will enjoy reading this again.<br /><br />Amazon's price is fair along with the many other retailers on here.<br /><br />I dig it, and if you are a fan of Marvel events you will get something out of it. I can't wait to see where the fallout of this event takes Cyclops.<br /><br />So here are five stars, just to bump Avengers VS. X-Men's ratings!!!<br /><br />Peace, I'm out. BAMF!
B000ADWDF2|3.0|DEFINITELY a  Scandinavian (BROODING) film. The acting is good, but the movie just is not anything special. I would not recommend it. The American version was done in 2010. It's not an especially good movie, either--with the exception of Toby Maguires performance. It really surprised me. Very Good. Very Chilling.
0446580848|2.0|DeMille has worn out the John Corey character. The initial biting wit of this character in earlier novels has become simple insipidness and annoying banter that detracts from the storyline. While DeMille novels have usually been long, they were at least entertaining. Corey's non-stop banality in The Panther is so irritating that I have finished a Cussler novel in between and am starting a Connelly novel at the 70% mark of The Panther. I do this just to mitigate the aggravation of the Corey character (who I used to enjoy) and thus enable me to eventually finish the book. I do like DeMille, but I'm done with John Corey.<br /><br />Update: 12/13/12 - Finally finished this book. Previously said that I had to stop reading this and turn to a Cussler and a Connelly novel to lessen the aggravation of the John Corey character. In reality I read those two and added a Vince Flynn novel...then finished The Panther. There was some redemption by DeMille in the final chapters as the pace quickened (although the actual final scene between Corey and The Panther was superficial and idiotic; seemed like DeMille simply 'forced' the ending) which mitigated somewhat the annoyance of the character; however, if you bought this book, do yourself a favor and start around chapter 50. You'll save yourself some agita. Again, no more John Corey for me.
B009HEMW4W|4.0|nice ending while leaving it open for more in the series, one of the better alien movies out right now
B000FBJG04|5.0|Personal accounts are used at the perfect time.  I couldn't put this book down.  Recommended to all.  A must read!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this game.  It's fun,  challenging,  great graphics,  nice music and sound effects.  The only annoyance I've come across though is that when you want to back out of a screen,  your natural tendency is to hit the back button... Which boots you from the game.  The back button should undo your last move...  Not exit you from the game.  Other than that .. Awesome game!
1476719071|5.0|This book was so amazing. I don't think it could have been written any better. Terrific book Jamie, love the possessiveness.
0394818237|5.0|I love reading this book with my son almost as much as he does. Of course there is the basic story to read, but there are also so many more to create together with all the illustrations on each page.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|First saw a short clip of the DVD at a home electronics store as part of a Bose demo. Bought the CD and DVD together. Live outdoor performance in Chicago, excellent recording both audio and video. Really enjoy Jason Mraz's Beautiful Mess!!
B000T412OU|5.0|loved the action and it was pretty clean for a thriller rated R. There was suspense right up until the last 5 seconds!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really love reading these books but they always end when they get good.  Wish he would tie up some loose ends sometimes.  You can tell he use to write for Tv as he always ends with you wanting more.  Can't wait for the next one to come out
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Wow! This movie is a gem.  The King, his wife, the speech tutor and his wife, are all magnificent.  I loved the movie and I highly recommend the movie to everyone.The prince in waiting deserves to be king. He has all the traits of a leader and his father knows it.  There are issues from the past which affect him in his present.  I own this movie and I intend to re-watch it over and over again. I just wish I had friends who would enjoy such a movie. I need to join a movie clud so that I can discuss movies.  Please do rent or buy, you won't regret it.  I promise.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles have been moderately difficult,  not too much so. And I like that you can choose your piece number. So far I have not seen any of the issues others have encountered. I am on a a kindle fire.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I'm craving more from PTX. This is just too short. The arrangements are clever--something I expect from the group. And the harmonies are spot on.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Really easy to read, understand, and apply! Since I heard about this book and barefoot running that I moved to flat and thin shoes, which made my lower back pain disappear!<br /><br />Nice book, recomended 100%!!!!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My favorite scene is the one where he cusses his boss.  Classic!!<br /><br />Randy Quaid really steals the scenes in the Vacation movies.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|With the wave of films and books about Lincoln, I was curious about this movie and then saw that Robert Redford directed, so I knew it would be good. He's an excellent director. His movies always entertain and engage me -- they are thoughtful and beautiful and he gets wonderful performances out of excellent actors.<br />This was no disappointment. I had never heard of Mary Surrat and her fate as an accomplice in the assassination of Lincoln. It's a true story and the movie draws tight the tension between justice and expediency. Expediency wins. The film depicts how the powerful can bend justice and forsake it for what they consider a higher purpose, or, in this case, it's implied, for revenge.<br />This is a fact of life in any age. I think that's what Redford is saying -- it's in America's dna -- the forsaking of the principles of the Constitutional rights of individuals on the whim of the powerful in certain moments of history. James McAvoy is wonderful as the young lawyer who is at first ordered to defend Mary Suratt, and then embraces his job realizing the hazard and danger for all when the rights of one person are trampled.<br />Robin Wright is stoic and heroic as Mary Surratt, she nails the character ... beautiful performance.<br />Kevin Kline disappears into the character of Seward, giving a masterful performance as the secretary of state whose stated motive for railroading Mary is to preserve peace after the civil war and to keep southerners in their place, so to speak.<br />The cast shines, and the movie is true to period, very enjoyable, and, also, sad, compassionate, and --- warning, another spoiler -- McAvoy's character, after the farce of a \\"trial\\", left the law and became the first editor of the Washington Post...dedicated to truth as a newspaperman...a noble profession that I hope survives this age! There are many ironies at the end of this movie, ironies of history and of fate. Worth seeing for sure.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This like the others are very good to pass enjoyable time, reading about how things should get done today. The only slow part that I recall is when Mitch, blow the air tank and hurt his head. This lasted to long for me. Once I found out it was the Assassin, that was hired to hit Mitch, and he in turn help turn the table of that fight. That they would each earn a little more respect for each other. I know he was the one that killed Mitch's wife, and he let him live, for his wife, and girl. I had thought they would form some type of uneasy friendship. Who knows what the future holds on that. Overall I can't wait for the next one. Maybe about a young Mitch, again.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I feel a lot of movies these days lack substance. \\"Lawless\\" however is a great story and<br />the acting is above average. Tom Hardy really shines here as well does Guy Pierce. I<br />think the book \\"The Wettest Country\\" would probably be a great read because it seemed<br />there was a lot more information to this true story. The movie tied to deliver that information<br />through a quick montage. All in all \\"Lawless\\" was a really good movie and very entertaining.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Another winner by DeMille.  After a hiccup with Spencerville, I gave up for a bit , but he has come back to win me over.  John Corey's thoughts and comments had me laughing out loud once again.  I will  definitely recommend this to friends.  I thought Charm School and Gold Coast were a tad better than this, but he didn't disappoint with his combination of humor, plot, intensity and excitement.
B002M3SOXI|5.0|What's not to love with this series?  A funny and true version of middle school life told through the jaded view of a slacker, Greg Heffley.<br /><br />Will Greg's father ever despair of changing his sons?  Apparently not!  This third book has the oldest male Heffley encouraging his middle son to toughen up and play team sports-or else!  Well, the else turns out to be military school.  Greg, of course, resists all attempts at change and stays his adorable, hilarious, selfish self.  One of the funniest parts of the book occurs at the very beginning when Greg makes his own New Year's resolution to be more helpful.  So, he gives his mom advice about her junk food habits and growing waistline.  Gotta love him!<br /><br />These book are just so funny, even for me, an older woman.  I know they are targeted for middle school male reluctant readers but I love them, too!  I often have to fight over my own copies in my open classroom.  This is a really fast read and you can devour the entire book in about 90 minutes or so.  I can't wait to jump into the next one!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I have 39000 coins.  Have completed all puzzles and prize levels.  Wish there as update.  I keep playing though.  It does pass time.
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham does it again with this book. It's hard to put down & it's another great one. I enjoyed it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game!! Except it will not link to Facebook for some strange reason.. Keeps saying it is &quot;misconfigured&quot;, I don't know.. I am missing out on receiving extra credits because it's &quot;misconfigured!!&quot; Oh well??  :-D Four stars until I can get my extra credits..
1907563202|5.0|I bought this book specifically for the Nesting Doll set. I fell in love with the other patterns, too! First the book is divided by skill and difficulty, but that wouldn't deter anyone from making a cute design for a baby or your home. The shawl is especially lovely. Can't wait to make the nesting dolls!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I could not be happier with my purchase of the Plantronics Voyager Legend except when it comes to charging. The cable that came with headset is much smaller than previous models. This case provides me with a stylish case that functions as a charger as well. I simply keep the case charged and throw my headset inside when heading out the door. It charges the headset very quickly. I have seen this case as a bundled item with headset in some stores but it was well worth the extra $30 for me.
B0053O89JM|5.0|This is the last season of House and I wish it wasn't. I enjoy watching the DVD because there are no commercials and you can pause it when you want.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is very cute and simple enough for my girls to be able to play.  Coins can be earned faster than the other games that have similar formats.  One of the things that you can use is called &quot;bling&quot;.  These are very hard to earn, but you can purchase them if you have the money.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I honestly enjoyed the book.  I thought it was a different look at Spec Op Warriors.  I think the SEAL did the right thing coming forward and getting the stories of our Spec Op Warriors to the people who they protect......the price they pay.  The loss of time with family, the loss of memories most Americans take for granted.  The quiet professionals...that do what they do......never expecting a spotlight or parades.  The book is a great read.  I highly recommend it.  The ONLY problem I had with the book was at the end.  The President of the United States (POTUS) went before the world to announce the death of UBL.....the author had no problem with that.  Yet, I believe all Americans should have been upset with the comments about the op the POTUS made.  He announced to the world (and the very people these special men and women are and have been hunting in an attempt to stay off any future attacks) that we not only got the most wanted man in the world.....BUT....that we also collected a lot of Intel on site..!!!  Are you kidding?  How can this SEAL not mention that fact?  The POTUS basically told all those who were in the Intel items collected that we now know who and where you are......we have your email, phone number or address.......how many operations have been carried out based on that Intel?  I only ask because we all know President Obama is NOT shy about announcing his successes around the world when it comes to taking out bad guys.  However, we also know he will lie and do whatever it takes to cover up his failures, like Benghazi.  This book is a must read.  Like the SEAL mentioned, a book like this (or the one he read as a young boy) can change lives.  This book just might inspire another teen to join those \\"Quiet Professionals\\"......to join the ranks of a Special Operations Unit.  Hope this helped.  Merry Christmas and God less our troops still out there in harm's way and God Bless America!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I'm addicted to only one game but this one is not \\"it\\".  I do enjoy playing it occasionally.  One learns with just the one suit.  I'm at the level of 2 suits which is harder to win.  I've never attempted the 3 nor 4 suits so can look forward to trying them in the future.<br />One can use the \\"hints\\" part in the lower right corner for help.
B000068FXX|5.0|It's a different album to some of their more popular works (Crime of the Century is their best IMHO) but it's sill got that unmistakable Supertramp feel. One of the top ten in my list of great driving albums.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A good, solid, game, to be sure.  I don't know if this particular apt has all the different kinds of Solitaire games or not.  Never tho't about it before now so will have to take a \\"gander\\" some day.  I play it now'n'then.  I think the apt was free when I downloaded it.
B002VECM72|5.0|Got this for a gift, so I have no idea of the quality of the disc. Looks good as new, so I suspect it will be fine. Shipping was very prompt and well packaged.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I began my \\"addiction\\" to the game on the computer and then continued it on my Kindle Fire.  I really like this version as one can choose 4 different levels (4 varied colored dragons) that has 14 different levels (numbered boxes) and w/in each of the 14, the games change their tile patterns (I don't know how many times).<br /><br />A timed game, if you reach a certain time you get one star (sorry, I don't exactly know what the time limit is but remember seeing 6.\\"?\\" min.).<br />For the second star, again w/random tile pattern changes, you need to do it in about 5.\\"?\\" min.<br />To receive the 3rd star, you have to complete one of the tile pattern games in under 5 min. (4.\\"?\\")!!<br /><br />Some of the games I had to play over'n'over'n'over, again'n'again (for WEEKS!), when I begun to recognize some of the tile patterns which eventually helped me to reach the under 5 min. requirement.<br />Other levels were much easier & reached 3 stars fast.<br />One can change around w/in the whole game to pick levels.<br /><br />It is very challenging!  And can become somewhat addicting, however, I could quit anytime I got tired.  By simply clicking the \\"off\\" button on the Kindle Fire, it saved the game I quit & it was there the next time I turned my device \\"on\\".  I finally reached 3 stars on all levels, after approx. 6 mos. of playing it almost daily (several times a day).  Now looking for another MahJong game.<br /><br />I believe a novice needs to learn the simple MahJong game of matching pairs of tiles, to learn how to recognize the differences in the ones that look similar, before taking on this challenging game, as it could be frustrating for a beginner.<br /><br />This is THE LONGEST review I've even made of many, various, products I've procured from Amazon!  Guess what I love?  Ha-ha
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|it is the best game ever I love it. it is so adicting awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome. I love it
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I've heard others rave about Angry Birds so just \\"had\\" to have it.  Since it was free I downloaded it and played it for awhile.  It must be me as I don't see what about is the \\"fun\\"!  I AM addicted to MahJong so guess it's probably \\"different strokes for different folks\\", eh.  So I don't condemn nor condone getting this game.  'Tis strictly up to what you like.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This was delivered just as it was released...and it was such a joy to not have to go shopping in a store to get it. It arrived in good condition and Amazon was even good enough to adjust the price (without me asking) which apparently had gone down between the time I ordered it and when it was delivered. Great purchase!
B0002W19KQ|4.0|Enjoyed the movie but with so many French actors trying to speak in English,found it a bit annoying . Even John Malkovich is a fluent French speaker.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|It works for my 3 year old. The end. Yep. It really works for my 3 year old.  It really does.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Poorly made movie based more on soft porn than a real story to tell. Too many characters confuse the viewer and the actors are strictly 3rd rate.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Although I have never written a review for an album, I felt compelled to do so for My Head is An Animal. The only reason I bought this album is because it was on sale. I wasn't really expecting too much, but I am absolutely blown away by this band. There isn't a single filler song on the album; every song is great. I highly recommend this album to any lover of music.
B003D81NVQ|5.0|The writers of this series are excellent and take the viewer into the mind of a once gentle, somewhat cowardly yet brilliant chemistry teacher that as time goes on slowly undergoes metamorphosis into a cold blooded killer who will do anything to ascend his personal ladder of power.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Santa Clause Is Coming To Town really swings.  Nice arrangement.  Also a couple of tunes not usually heard.  Very Good.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|There was so much ballet in this movies, and I don't like ballet, that the main theme of insanity of the main actress was completely skimmed over until the last suicidal act. This film could have been great with much more focus on the main actress and her unbalanced mother. Portman is an average actress who can dance ballet but I never really connected with her as a terribly unbalanced, haunted young woman that was striving for perfection. The ending was to much on the theme of Romeo and Juliet without Romeo.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I am a Rod Stewart fan and I truly enjoy this Xmas tape.  I bought several for friends & neighbors
B007HGPBRC|4.0|This was a powerful read.  I took breaks along the way to think about his situation.  It gave me a new perspective. A view of terminal cancer from the other side.  Well thought out observations by Mr. Hitchens.  I see Cancer  differently now. Its a short book read it slow.Thank you, Christopher.
034580404X|3.0|Decided to order the trilogy based on all the hype from friends. Im not disappointed that's all I can say.
B001GD5ALO|4.0|Would have given 5 stars but I'm old school and miss the  sleeve, notes, pics, etc that used to come with a purchase. I guess some day I'll get over it for the ease of a download purchase. Maybe one day they'll add those files???? Maybe that would do it for us ???
B006MPK9SU|5.0|I am an unabashed Michael Connelly fan, having read (to the best of my knowledge) pretty much all of his books, at least those in the Harry Bosch series....Bosch, the ultimate anti-hero, a man with a conscience, he battles the LAPD bureacracy as much as he does the bad guys, and plenty of those bad guys are within that very same organisation...he struggles with relationships, and his very own past.... i'm not going into plot details here, this particular Bosch story covers a short period of time between the murder of a prominent civil rights lawyer and the resulting investigation, which Boschs' nemesis, Irvin Irving seems determined to hijack for political reasons....<br /><br /> I have Harry Bosch up there with my two other favourite characters, Lee Childs' &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; and John Connollys' &#34;Charlie 'Bird' Parker&#34;....all ruthless in the pursuit of meting out their own particular form of justice.. sometimes they get it all wrong, which makes them all the more human...
B001706I5I|4.0|One of our annual must see movies during the Christmas season.  Certainly not high brow or quite the same as the animated classic, but a fun movie nonetheless.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Can't seem to get my husband off it. Good thing it rains so much in Seattle, what else you gonna do?
B0097NGUJG|5.0|One of the best albums of the year, I would say. I stumbled upon a song and was immediately hooked.  After listening to the rest of the album, I can say with confidence and alt-j has done some marvelous things. Get this for a friend who is into indie rock or the hipster in your life. This kind of music isn't for everyone.
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I have read all of Michael Connellys books and they are the best books you and read from start to finish.....
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Whether you're a fan of the books, or simply looking for a great show, this is a must-watch.  Of course on Blu-ray, it's just that much better.  This set has some really fun special features to get you more drawn into the world of Westeros.  Waiting for season 2 to release...

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't read a book in a while before this and I really loved this book.  I read the entire series and I could hardly put them down.  I think I read all the books within a week.
B001KMB6YG|4.0|I love this movie.  If you watch this movie as an action-adventure movie, you will be disappointed.  However, if you watch it as a science-fiction movie with religious overtones, you will enjoy it.  I agree that I don't care for the ending.  However, just knowing that he lets go of the anger and bitterness is enough.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I hadn't read a book in a while before this and I really loved this book.  I read the entire series and I could hardly put them down.  I think I read all the books within a week.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Very enjoyable light jazz music - Paul actually has very fitting voice for the arrangements. If you are fan of the music style and Paul's you shouldn't miss adding this to your collection.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Fantastic singer.Every one of her hit LP is Great. She has great selection of music. I recommend this LP. Listen.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Was such a disappointing book that I felt like my time was stolen by spending it reading this book............not a thriller of past Grisham novels at all.  Kept reading this waiting for it to get better but it never did.........don't waste your time!!
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I've bought every Diana Krall album since she started out in the jazz world years ago, but was totally disappointed in this new album.  It seems she has decided to switch from jazz to a slow, dull country style with no good band accompaniment and all the songs just drag along.  The pick of songs was poor as was the production of all the songs on this album.  She should definitely go back to her old jazz style with a full orchestra backing her, and try up some better upbeat songs.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I have a hard time being entertained anymore but this movie finally got me going. I had to watch it several times just to make sure I didn't miss anything funny. Will is an excellent actor. I've enjoyed all three of these, best thing about the ending of three, there has got to be a forth.
B0045HCJR6|4.0|My grandkids watch this DVD over and over and over.  Now they sing and dance to these time honored songs and routines.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|If I feel like watching a smart film, it's always The Italian Job. What a cast! Mark Wahlberg gives a stellar performance, Edward Norton (always brilliant) is the best villain, and Seth Green makes me laugh every time I watch. They are the bad guys we want to win.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This is a fantastic game as far as puzzle adventures go. The graphics are beautiful, the puzzles are fun, and it's a bit challenging at times.<br /><br />The only reason this got a 4 out of 5 is because of playability. It took me about 3 hours to finish it. I really wish there would have been more to it, I could have played it for days.
B008U0FJF8|5.0|Creative and current, this CD by Manu Katche has a hint of the Modern Jazz Quartet of former years. I listen to it once and am ready to hear it again. He is brilliant.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I'm very happy with this app on my Kindle fire.  I find it well laid out and easy to use.<br /><br />I tend to use my Fire now to track tasks and sync with Google Tasks online rather than using my PC or laptops.
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|Great movie! Just seemed 2 fast forward a lot and keep you guessing Didn't get the part when Jack left the church with one shoe then is getting beaten while wearing 2 shoes then his brother gives his missing shoe back. Also a lot of parts in the movie in explained like it was quickly edited so they can release it could've been longer with more character story lines leaves it up to the viewer to decipher. But overall a great story Shia is a great actor and I would recommend this movie and give it 4 stars. Must see it on bluray for all the extras and deleted scenes if they have em :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game, lots of fun for whole family. almost like being at the fair. great prides. I would highly recommend this game for all ages.
B009APMNB0|1.0|Tried two different computers, kept getting xritedevice.dll missing. Really wish it worked. Downloaded latest software from their site but it is the same v 1.0 as on the CD so no help.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headphones are great.<br /><br />Pros<br /> I like that the mic mutes automatically when you raise it out of the way.<br /> I like the volume control on the left ear<br /> I like the spool that hold the charging wire<br /><br />Cons<br /> Its a pain in the arse to turn off.  Sometime I swear I have to hold the button for 5 seconds to get it to turn off<br /> The usb plug should either be reduced in length or made to flex... to easy to snap it off with a laptop.<br /> The power doesnt last very long.  Maybe 10 hours of use.  I expected 20-30.
1579129129|4.0|This hardcover is a beautiful collection of Nick Mann's photos of skulls that were prepared by a private collector, Alan Dudley. Dudley came to Winchester's attention after getting busted buying an illegal howler monkey skull. He pleaded guilty, did his service and paid his fine, and the implication is that he isn't normally one to slip up in this way. (Replicas of many species are readily available, by the way.) Dudley gets almost all of his skulls from zoos.<br /><br />Among this book's virtues are a plethora of bird, fish and reptile skulls. Photographs of mammal skulls are widely available as they are the taxonomic touchstone for mammals. The others, not so much. Partly they are less common because (I know from trying) fish and reptile skulls can be the very devil to prepare.<br /><br />Of special interest: a great assortment of hornbills, odd and fragile skulls of venomous snakes, wild pigs with their seemingly self-destructive curving tusks. Be sure to take a look at the domestic dog skulls and consider what we have done to the sturdy wolf.<br /><br />Most of the photos are by Nick Mann, who has done great work on other Workman Publishing science books as well, and most are excellent. The photos are interspersed with Winchester's wry text about skulls in art, history, human evolution, etc. These are interesting, written for a non-technical audience, but this is primarily a visual book and a beautiful addition to the natural history library.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|The iPhone great looking, beautifully designed.  This is the only cover I can find that let's the phone show, while still giving a bit of protection.
B000002QWD|5.0|I was just a kid when I learned to love this Christmas musical classic.  My dad had it on an LP, otherwise known as a 33 1/3 rpm vinyl disk or record.  When I left home and then had my own family, I too bought the vinyl album for the Christmas season and my kids.<br />Fast forward to today 2012.  I bought this CD for my daughter this year, who is married and has her own child now.  Good music never goes out of style and Christmas music as good as this is rare nowadays. I want my grandchildren to know of its timelessness also.
B0041D843M|5.0|I couldn't put this down.  It was very informative, readable, and showed how a good diet not only helps protect from cancer, but a host of other diseases.  Since I started eating a plant-based diet, I am amazed how much more stamina I have, how the aches and pains have subsided, how my skin problems have improved, and how the excess weight has just come off (35 lbs.) effortlessly.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|Perfect purchase for the month before the Neil Young concert I wnet to. All great songs. Good sampling of his popular stuff. Does not reflect his eclectic style or range of music, but has the songs everyone remembers most.

I don't know to use it and don't care to have a social page. u can't rotate buildings or move things so when u place it it is there.  they need to do an id type thing like the story games. I will remove game till it is fixed they can send an email to say its fixed.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I have not read the first three books, but enjoyed the TV series and could not wait for the next instalment so purchased this book.  I can see why this was translated into a TV series, this book is just fantastic.  Exceptionally well written, great characters with multiple story lines that intertwine, but you never no how the plot will evolve.  Completely unpredictable.  Also the book links very well to the TV series, so very easy to follow.  Can't wait to get the next book, but do not want the series to end.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|this is a cute game but again it is connected to facebook. I don't like to have to be forced to open facebook to be able to receive help from neighbors. I am removing the game. maybe I will try it again.

1612183956|4.0|I am new to this author - I've only read one other book of his before this one, which was \\"Run\\", and I really enjoyed that one as well. But this one I liked a bit more, actually, when I originally anticipated it to be the other way around.<br /><br />  I tend to give vague reviews on purpose just because as a writer myself I tend to get carried away sometimes and before I know it I'm spilling the beans, but just to give a little background on this book - A secret service agent suffers a near fatal car accident en route trying to locate two missing agents that disappeared in the little haven of Wayward Pines and he wakes up with a serious case of amnesia. Well, it turns out to be something far serious than that...<br /><br />  From that moment onward the lead character, Ethan Burke, is in the thick of it. Nothing around him is what it seems - not the townspeople nor the town itself. Adding to the mix, he can't find his ID or other possessions proving he is who he says he is and nobody seems to want to help him<br />contact his family or superiors on the outside.<br /><br />  The discoveries this man makes while trying to find a way out of this \\"paradise\\" would make any person insane. I won't give anything away, but this Ethan Burke is not one to take anything lying down and he was determined to get to the bottom of Wayward Pines if it killed him - and it nearly does when all is said in done.<br /><br />  In the end there is a twist I doubt any person could see coming. As I've said, this is my second book from this author and one thing I notice about Mr. Crouch is that he loves twists. So do any other avid fan of thrillers. This book was very psychological. So much so that when the cat was finally out of the bag, it had me thinking about the fate of humanity.<br /><br />  For a while I only read Mr. Stephen King exclusively before finally branching out to Mr. Dean Koontz (who's been around just as long), but I was looking for someone fresh and I am elated with Mr. Blake Crouch (come on, you know someone with a cool name like \\"Blake\\" has to be kick-ass.) I like how from first paragraph, the lead character was up shit's creek. You knew that from the first paragraph and onward. There were scenarios posed in this book I just wasn't sure how even a fictional character could get out of it. But Mr. Crouch not only got Ethan out of some very intense scenarios, he did so in surprisingly believable ways. It wasn't just someone trying to look for an opening so they would make sense.<br /><br />  And his descriptions of suffering...really, you are just in agony with the character. Both in this book and his other one, Run, he describes the character's suffering with such clarity that it made me glad to be sitting in my recliner in my warm home reading this as supposed to the people I was reading about.<br /><br />  I just purchased Thicker Than Blood, the complete Andrew Z. Thomas trilogy and I was hooked on the first book in the series just from the sample of it I read at the end Pines.<br /><br />  Mr. Crouch is a very phenomenal writer and I do believe he is my new favorite author. My only small beef might be with his comfort of using broken sentences. He did it frequently in Run as well and I guess that is just his writing style. Either way, I don't feel it takes away from the thrilling content of his novels, but it is a bit of a nuisance.

B007REV4YI|5.0|In general Bond movies tend to be action fun, some are campy and cheesy, some are more straight action. Bond is always suave, and the women always attractive. Those elements are still there, we have the action, a bit of camp (the Aston Martin has a glorious homage to campy days) and we have a surprisingly well crafted movie.<br /><br />Themes and motifs appear through out the movie and are called back to multiple times. Nothing is wasted, if you see something in the first half, it'll have relevance in the second half. The theme and motif of mirrors plays an important role with multiple illusions and distractions caused by reflections, and the fact that Mr Silver is himself a dark reflection of where Bond is and what he's going through.<br /><br />Old vs New and Human vs Technology permeate the movie as we see a film that joyously stands up for the old fashioned spy movies and spy work. One of the questions that's explicitly brought up is do we need human intelligence assets in a world where we can gain so much through technology? The movie, as one should expect, points out the value of having human operatives.<br /><br />Enjoy the movie, pay attention, and be surprised by a shockingly deep Bond flick.

1451695195|5.0|It is impossible to not believe in heaven after reading this book. My husband had big doubts whether this author was authentic when reading the first couple of chapters; however, when finished with the book, there was no doubt left in his mind that the author really experienced heaven. The author tried every conceivable method to disprove his experience and the reader is left with a warm heart and hope for a beautiful afterlife.
B009GGWX5E|3.0|While the claim is that this release is being released for the first time in US, the truth is the Tommy Bolin Archives released the full Japan concert back around 2000. Titled This Time Around, Live in Japan 1975, it was a 2 cd, 2 hour show from the infamous concert in which Bolin supposedly slept on his arm the wrong way (wink wink) a few nights before the show.  The band hadn't yet clicked on tour at this point and it shows. Songs like Burn, Smoke, Highway Star sound tiring, while the newer songs like Gettin' Tighter (while not on this release) You Keep on Moving, Lady Luck the band perform with enthusiasm.  The absolute highlight(s) of the show we're Tommy Bolin's Wild Dogs, and the song Drifter (not on this release) caught fire. This release is purely for the purist who want everything DP on CD to either match or replace their LP's. For those curious about the Tommy Bolin led Deep Purple live in concert, this release nor This Time Around will win you over. Check out Deep Purple In Concert (courtesy of King Biscuit) Long Beach 1976 for a fiery show. While most of the same material is performed, it's more excitably performed, and Tommy Bolin shows off his true guitar genius throughout.

B007REV4YI|1.0|Daniel Craig is my favorite Bond, the thing is the the storyline of this film is ridiculous. Seriously flawed storyline. Just to explain how plain stupid this film is I will simply describe the part that upset me the most. So after Bond comes back to MI6 he has to take tests to show that he is fit for field work. On the target test he fails the test badly, he rushes to the washroom and with a sharp item jabs his wound to find several metallic objects that he submits for tracking/testing. Keeping in mind that bond was gone for months to come back alive, we are expected to believe that these metal fragments were in his body the whole time. It gets more ridiculous from there because the fragments are tracked to only 3 people in the entire planet that use a special metal for custom made bullets. Three pictures pop up and Bond identifies the person they are after, the person is quickly identified as a \\"GHOST\\" someone they have absolutely no info on, but apparently they know the bullets he uses and have a great close up picture of him. So what do they do? They call in a favor from the CIA and that all it took to find where and when this guy will show up to get his next target and thats where the movie jumps to as bond finds his target. I wanted to walk out right there! Later in the film We discover SKYFALL is the mansion/area where bond is from and we find out about bonds past that quickly turns into BATMAN. Rich background, parents died when he was young, as an orphan M picked him for MI6, caretaker/butler was watching over the estate, tombstones with bonds' parents etc. He purposely leaves a method to be tracked down that only the villein can track down who is after M. So bond has a day or two to prepare and he sets traps and rigs the place up for the incoming battle. BUT! he keeps M (Old woman) with him and not transfer her to a secure location away from the danger! I don't know what else to say, just bad writing, and completely disappointing. At least the 70's we expected the story to be over the top and outrageous, this was just stupid.

B002QXI2M2|5.0|The Paris Opera Ballet is considered by many to presently be the world's finest company.  They recently performed in New York after a long absence, but friends who know I hate Pina Bausch wondered why I was going to see this ballet. My answer was that this glorious Gluck Opera is usually dreadfully static on the stage, and I was curious how it would look when danced. The evening was absolutely extraordinary.  Bausch seemed to have been reined in from his weird excesses by Gluck's lucid classical music.  The choreography provided passion to the simple libretto.  There are certainly finer vocal renditions of the opera, but as an overall experience they can't come close to glory of this deeply moving dance/opera.  Filming dance is always difficult,and Bausch's work loses a bit on film, but the dancers are exquisite.  This is truly a stunning achievement!!!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Anita Moorjani has such a unique story to share about her Near Death Experience (NDE). This book is captivating and I would highly recommend it. We are reading it for our book club and I can't wait to hear everyone's thoughts on it.
B001GXYBY6|5.0|Remember being a kid, plopped in front of the tv with your popcorn soggy in chocolate ice cream as you root for Speed and yell \\"boo\\" at the bad guys?  Remember feeling disappointed when Spritle didn't hit the candy jackpot or laughing hard enough to make the ice cream shoot out your nose every time Chim-chim did something crazy?  Those days are back with this hypercharged remake of the original anime classic.  Speed and all his pals are perfectly in character.  You'll get to find out what Pops Racer was doing before he got involved in racing.  You'll see for the first time what really makes Racer X so motivated to stay anonymous.  You'll even grit your teeth a little when that good for nothing Snake Oiler shows up.  This movie has not been cluttered with any sex, alcohol, drugs or whatever you'd rather keep your kids from seeing, so go ahead and play it for the whole family.  There is some violence, but it's tastefully done without making a bloody gore show out of it.  Best yet, it ties up a few loose ends left by the anime series.  You can't go wrong with this one.<br /><br />Haven't seen any Speed Racer at all?  No problem!  The plot line of this remake was very carefully scripted to ensure full audience comprehension without the need to go and look anything up in anime archives or make any phone calls to fifty year old otaku geeks.  It'll be just as good for new audiences forty years from now as it is today.  Good CGI special effects are included.

B007PF7MGS|4.0|For years, even before it was trendy, I was interested in the \\"paleo diet\\", which asserts that if we eat like our early ancestors did before the dawn of agriculture, we will be much healthier because our species evolved on the hunter gatherer lifestyle, not based on an agricultural lifestyle.<br /><br />In other words, homo sapiens have been surviving for 200,000 years predominantly on animals (meat, fish, fowl), fruit, nuts, and vegetables. We didn't evolve to consume milk throughout life (especially that of another species) or grains, or beans. One of the implicit arguments is that we didn't evolve to be consumers of starch, but the agricultural revolution starting around 10,000 years ago changed that, and the change has not been for the better. That is the premise of the paleo diet.<br /><br />Dr McDougall, unlike the vast majority of authors who have backed away from the stance that a low fat high carbohydrate diet is healthy for humans, sticks to his guns and provides a cogent counter-argument to the paleo premise. He claims that humans evolved on starch, and that all forms of animal tissue (protein, fat, cholesterol) degrade health. It's a bold stance in a world that has turned away from the low fat high carb diets that were popular in the 1980's.<br /><br />Dr McDougall claims that civilization was built on starch, and he's right. Without the cultivation of grains, beans, potatoes, etc., civilization as we know it would not exist. The hunter gather lifestyle cannot support the population density required to invent and build cities, roads, ocean vessels, steam engines, electricity, medicine, technology, etc. Without starch, paleo dieters wouldn't have even been born to discuss the evils of starch with each other on the internet.<br /><br />Now does he go too far with his argument that the low fat vegan diet is optimal for humans? I don't know. I don't think anyone knows for sure, but his belief stems from over 30 years of improving the health of his patients, some of who were thought to be beyond help by the medical establishment. I think he does a good job showing that, even though civilization was built on starch, once a culture gets affluent and starts adding higher and higher levels of animal products and vegetable oils, health degrades rapidly.<br /><br />I'm glad that I purchased this book, and would recommend it to open-minded health conscious friends, or anyone struggling with the diseases of western civilization (overweight, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer). I would also recommend it to paleo and low carb dieters who are concerned about recent research which sugests that levels of protein of over 1g/kg of body weight activates the mtor pathway, and increases cancer risk substantially. This research may also suggest that animal protein, with its higher levels of branched chain amino acids, may be worse than plant-based protein for this risk factor, but I'm not enough of an expert to discuss that (I'll just consider it and continue to try to understand the research for my own health).<br /><br />Has this book changed my eating habits? Yes. I'm experimenting with reducing meat and adding back starch. It seems that when I stop adding oils and reduce animal protein significantly, starch doesn't cause my body to store fat. I've been stuffing myself with rice, oatmeal, vegetables, and fruit, and I've lost 2 pounds in the first week (which I gained from Thanksgiving).<br /><br />Will it change my eating habits long term? I think so, but I'm taking it one day at a time for now.some of who were thought to be beyond help by the medical establishment.

B008G12ERC|3.0|Pretty simple: Madness, Animals, and Explorers are very good songs.  Supremacy has some badly sung parts, but when those parts are edited out, it's a good song.  There really isn't much else listenable on the album.  Definately a downgrade from the previous couple of albums.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Luckily for us, there's a growing variety of photo editing apps for the Kindle Fire and other Android devices available here. Some are quite good for basic tasks, and some just don't cut it, to put it frankly. There are freebies and paid apps, so sometimes it's difficult to pick a good one that will meet the needs of a photographer who is looking for a higher level editing tool.<br /><br />The [[ASIN:B007D2XSW0 PicShop]] photo editor is one of the good ones, especially with the newest 2.5.0 version, which fixed a few small but irritating bugs. At 17.5MB it's not exactly small, and it will take a little less than three minutes to download to your device, but once installed it's well worth the time and space. You then have a complete photo editing suite, with plenty of filters and effects from which to pick.<br /><br />You can read the specs here, which include the essential red-eye & blemish removal, image cropping, brightness & contrast, image sharpening & blurring, and a lot more. For this user, the social integration with Facebook and email have proven to be invaluable, though I have yet to try it with Twitter.<br /><br />The developer also offers the [[ASIN:B007FFZSE6 PicShop Lite]] app, a freebie that I first started with, then upgraded to this one. As far as photo editing apps go, as one who does a lot of on-the-fly editing of uploaded images, this app ranks up there with the more costly [[ASIN:B004OZK9VW PicSay Pro]], which offers slightly different functionalities. Both of these have proven to be among the best on the Kindle Fire or Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" for this user, but your experiences may be different depending on your Android device.<br /><br />Update 4/2/2013:<br /><br />Installed this 2.8.2 version on my Samsung Galaxy S III, and it is a good upgrade.

0307341550|5.0|I read this after reading Flynn's \\"Gone Girl,\\" which I consider the most polarizing novel I've ever read; you either really, really love it because you get why Flynn ended it the way she did, or you really, really hate it for the exact same reason. (Here are three words I said at the end: \\"What? [pause] What?! [pause] WHAT?!?\\")<br /><br />With this book, which is her debut novel, you're at least satisfied with how it resolves, even if it might seem just a smidge far-fetched. All the characters have problems in one form or another, and the main character, Camille Preaker, is physically and emotionally -- actually, a strong combination of the two -- disturbed. But throughout, I found myself caring for her and wanting her to rise above her situation.<br /><br />I'd give this a thumbs up, and would recommend it for those who read \\"Gone Girl\\" and who, while perhaps disappointed by the ending, found Flynn's style of narrative fascinating enough to give her another chance. I'm planning on reading \\"Dark Places,\\" too.

I could only move between two screens, but once I restarted the app that problem went away. Anyone who gave this game a one star review needs to start to develop apps and games on their own.

B00843TZJM|2.0|There are some true high points in this set and it is amazing that these guys are still doing it at all after all these years.  Individually, David and Graham's voices sound pretty good.  Stephen sounds like Stephen and has solid moments, but in general seems to lack the control to make his voice do what he wants.  I purchased this set because I wanted a memory of seeing CSN a couple of summers ago at the Greek Theatre in LA.  Bottom line, the musicianship is still there, but the harmonies are just not that strong.  There are rocking, beautiful and poignant moments, but the guys sometimes (vocally) sound almost lost and are often tentative.  I'm a two channel guy, so the lack of any multichannel mixes doesn't bother me.  I had to purchase the set from best Buy to get the Blu Ray with the 2-CD's of the show.  Lastly, while I understand that much of CSN's music is rooted in social change, Graham's commentary and a few of the more 'in your face' tunes wore thin for me before I'd even heard them once.  If you've seen CSN live, you know what you are getting with Graham, but to include some of these tunes at the expense of classics like like \\"Almost Cut My Hair\\" (a highlight of the Greek show) is unfortunate.  Otherwise, a solid 3 star set, but only for true fans and completists.

B0085A9HXS|4.0|Having been based in Indonesia, Evans wanted to bring Indonesian martial arts, known as pencak silat, into the world of cinema and he would do just that in 2009 working with actor and Pencak Silat expert Iko Uwais in the film \\"Merantau\\".<br /><br />The film would gain a lot of attention from audiences at South by Southwest (SXSW) in Texas and eventually win \\"Best Film Award\\" at Action Fest 2010.<br /><br />So, Evans and Uwais collaborated for an even bigger project known as \\"The Raid\\" (a.k.a. \\"The Raid: Redemption in the U.S.) in 2011.  Originally planning a large scale prison gang film, the film proved to be too complex and time consuming, but most importantly too expensive. So, a plan for creating a SWAT team taking on drugdealers became the main storyline that Evans would focus on.<br /><br />With a smaller budget, Evans worked about four months in finalizing the script, having translated from English to Indonesian and working with Iko Uwais and Yayan Ruhian in developing the choreography.  Actors that made up the SWAT team were sent to bootcamp military training with KOPASKA (the premier frogman and underwater demolition unity of the Indonesian Navy) and learned how to use the basics of weaponry, strategic attacks and defensive techniques.<br /><br />After the film was created, Sony Pictures Worldwide acquired the distribution rights and brought it Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park along with Joseph Trapanese (\\"Traitor, \\"Tron: Legacy\\" and \\"Tron: Uprising\\") to create the new musical score for  the film.<br /><br />Since the film's screening at various film festivals, \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" has received rave reviews as one of the best action films created not only in 2012 but also within the last decade.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  It's important to remember that the film was low budget and shot with a Panasonic AF100.  While the AF100 is a very good video camcorder optimized for HD video, one can't expect too much from this low budget film.  But with that being said, while the picture quality may not be the best for the videophile as it does have banding issues and because it is shot indoors most of the time with scenes with lighting to little lighting, it is what it is.  It's not a vibrant film but picture quality is good but not great!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition\\" is presented in Indonesian/Bahasa and English 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Portuguese, Spanish (Latin and Castilian) 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Once again, this film is low budget but on the good side, Sony did bring in Mike Shinoda to revamp the musical score (you have a choice of selecting the original or Shinoda's musical score), so the new digital music score does sound good through the front and surround channels.  The bad side is that for a film that does utilize a ton of gunfire, it would have been great to incorporate a more immersive soundscape and directional sounds with bullets whizzing from one end to the other.<br /><br />Gareth Evans is still a filmmaker playing multiple hats in the film as director and editor but I hope for his next film, he does take advantage of lossless audio and making it more immersive.  Granted, I understand this film is a low budget and because of that, the lossless soundtrack is good, but it could have been better.<br /><br />As for the acting, I prefer watching foreign language films in their own language but for those who hate reading subtitles, will be happy to know that this Blu-ray release does come with an English dub.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Portuguese, Spanish (Latin and Castilian).<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary by writer and director Gareth Evans.<br />  Behind the Scenes Video Blogs - (39:32) Featuring the following mini-features: Bootcamp, set location, camera and lighting, makeup and special effects, riot van, courtyard, hole drop, drug lab, Tama's office, machete gang and corridor, John vs. Mad Dog and post-production.<br />  An Evening with Gareth Evans, Mike Shinoda and Joe Trapanese - (40:40) Featuring Post-screening footage moderated by Hadrian Belove.

So, when I first heard about \\"The Raid: Redemption\\", I approached the film with interest because it incorporated the martial art style known as Pencak Silat, shot in Indonesia by a Welsh filmmaker and featured music by Linkin Park's Mike Shinoda.  So, it's an interesting approach as I was not familiar with Gareth Evans work and was wondering why a Welsh filmmaker was in Indonesia and how Mike Shinoda took part in the film.<br /><br />But I started watching \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" and realized this film was going to be violent, possibly bloody and there is going to be a lot of fighting and weapons.  And in some way, it reminded me of older '80s Shaw Bros. films such as \\"Hong Kong Godfather\\", where the small amount of people who represent the good, take on a large force which consists of the bad.  And for those who have watched enough martial arts films, there is a banality to these martial arts films but its all about execution.<br /><br />\\"The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition\\" is an exciting non-stop action film that just keeps coming at you.  Action scene after action scene, you're just captivated by this fatalistic suicide mission.  It's one thing to have 20 elite SWAT team members, but it's another thing to go against dozens of gangsters, drug users that live in the 15+ story apartment building.  You know the body count will be high but you are pulling for the rookie, Rama.  Rama represents the clean cut family man who happens to be a rookie of the SWAT team but also the more reserved member who can kick ass!<br /><br />The fight scenes showcasing pencak silat is amazing!  What I enjoyed about the approach of fighting choreography for this film is to not having these fight scenes perfectly choreographed.  Mistakes happen, there is no clear edge of who will win and as Iko Uwais who plays the main protagonist Rama was pretty cool in execution, actor Yayan Ruhian who plays the evil \\"Mad Dog\\" is amazing.  At first, I thought this was your typical skinny guy with a gun, but instead this guy was showcasing silat movement that is so slick and smooth, you start to realize that this is the guy who will be doing the butt kicking and are not sure any of the good guys including Rama have a chance againsthim.<br /><br />But the violent action scenes are intriguing at times, where one stab is not enough, some disable or kill their enemy, may it be an axe to the neck or repeated stabs to the heart, the fight scenes are violent but it fit the moment where these SWAT team people have to use what they can to survive.<br /><br />But there is an opposite to all this that made me scratch my head at times.  Where we see other SWAT team members using their knives or whatever they have to fight, Rama was one who chose to use his fists instead of the weapons that lie around the ground.  There were times where I was asking myself, is this guy ever going to pick up a weapon on the floor to fight back?  These guys are coming at you with machetes and there are police batons, machetes, guns laying around, is he going to fight back.<br /><br />Also, when the SWAT team are fighting, you would think that it would be beneficial to them to take the ammunition from fallen SWAT team officers, just in case.  But I had to remind myself that this is a popcorn action film, and not to think so seriously about character motivation or logic.  It's a popcorn action film meant to to be enjoyed for its action, not a film for one to  think too deeply about situations.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, there are over a 100 minutes of special features but I noticed that many of them involved Mike Shinoda, which was cool but it would have been cooler to have the Indonesian talent featured as well.  It would have been great to feature more interviews with Iko Iwais, Joe Taslim, Donny Alamsyah, Yayan Ruhian, Pierre Gruno, Ray Sahetapy and more.  As for the picture and audio quality, while I'm sure on DVD, this film would look and sound very good... on Blu-ray, it's not the most vibrant film and you do experience some banding issues.  And you tend to wish that there was much better sound editing to make this film much more immersive for the audiophiles who expect a lot from action-intense films.<br /><br />But when it comes to a martial arts film with non-stop action, I will admit that \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" is a pulse-pounding, exciting action film and I have to agree... it is one of the better action film that I have seen within the last decade and yes, this year.  Gareth Evans and crew were able to utilize what they had, with what small budget and equipment they had at the time and they succeeded in creating such a fantastic, kick ass, all-action film!<br /><br />Overall, if you love action films, \\"The Raid: Redemption - Unrated Edition\\" is a must-see!ke Shinoda.

Only to find out it is not compatable with my new kindle HD 8.9.<br /><br />why would an HD app not be compatable eith ab HD device? seems pretty dumb to me.<br /><br />So, if you were looking to have this on a kindle HD device. DON'T BOTHER!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy and it was well formatted for the kindle.  It's my wife's favorite books and I read it because she was going to drag me to the theater.  I'm glad I did. The third book is the best, which is rarely the case.
B009GENZKS|3.0|I put off watching this at first because I prefer the live action movies to featurettes.  When I finally sat down and watched this animated version I was truly impressed with the graphics, music, and story.  This is well worth viewing, not only if you are a fan of the game, Resident Evil movies, or Science Fiction/Horror in general.  Based on the movies and/or game, this feature follows intrepid US undercover agent and Umbrella agent in Russia dealing with the political turmoil escalating to a war between the government and a rebel faction.  When the use of Bio Organic Weapons (BOW)s - (Umbrella Monsters), is deemed acceptable, the war gets ugly.  What was the biggest surprise to me was the comedy, it had several \\"quotable\\" lines that I enjoyed.<br /><br />CA Luster

B007K8ILUQ|4.0|Stanley Kubrick, one of America's legendary filmmakers responsible for films such as \\"Paths of Glory\\" (1957), \\"Spartacus\\" (1960), \\"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" (1964), \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (1968), \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" (1971), \\"The Shining\\" (1980), \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" (1987), to name a few.<br /><br />But all filmmakers have their beginnings and for Stanley Kubrick, his first feature film would be the 1953 film \\"Fear and Desire\\".<br /><br />Having created two documentaries (\\"Day of the Fight\\", \\"Flying Padre: An RKO-Pathe Screenliner\\") in 1951 and employed at \\"LOOK\\" Magazine, Kubrick quite his job to create his first feature film.<br /><br />Using funds that were raised by his family and friends, Kubrick and a classmate from his old high school, Howard Sackler, would go on to create \\"Fear and Desire\\".<br /><br />While not a box office hit, the film captured the attention of film critics, who took notice of Kubrick's talent.<br /><br />But among the Kubrick films available, \\"Fear and Desire\\" has only been screened at very few places since it's release.  One of those screenings were at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. back in 1993.  The film also has not been released commercially and even was downplayed by Kubrick, when he was alive, calling the film a \\"bumbling amateur film exercise\\".<br /><br />But in 2010, Turner Classic Movies aired a restored print courtesy of the George Eastman House and now, Kino Lorber will be releasing the film on Blu-ray and DVD in October 2012.  The version of \\"Fear and Desire\\" presented was mastered in HD from archival 35mm elements newly restored by the Library of Congress.<br /><br />The Blu-ray and DVD release will also include \\"The Seafarers, a short film created in 1953, a film which Kubrick took on in behalf of the Seafarers International Union in order to raise money for his next film \\"Killer's Kiss\\" (1954).<br /><br />\\"Fear and Desire\\" revolves around four soldiers who have crash landed in enemy territory.<br /><br />Lt. Corby (portrayed by Kenneth Harp), Sgt. Mac (portrayed by Frank Silvera), Pvt. Fletcher (portrayed by Stephen Coit)  and Pvt. Sidney (portrayed by Paul Mazursky) are six miles away from where they should be and know they must cross a river in order to survive.<br /><br />So, the four led by Lt. Corby, must evade enemy forces and create a raft and during nighttime, try to escape.<br /><br />But while building the raft, they are afraid they may have been spotted by a plane flying above them, so the four leave the raft and try to see what is out there in the surrounding area.<br /><br />The group spots a cabin where two enemy soldiers are eating.  Seeing their weapons and food, the four knows they must take the soldiers out and so, they devise a plan and are able to kill the two soldiers including one enemy soldier returning to the cabin.<br /><br />But Pvt. Sidney begins to crack after he sees the dead mean staring at him.<br /><br />As the four begin to work on their raft and see what is ahead of them near the river, a woman is seen catching fish with other women in the river.  While going home, she hears a noise (made by the soldiers hiding behind a bush).  The soldiers take her, bind her and try to interrogate her, but she does not speak any English.  So, the three continue their reconnaissance and leave the unstable Pvt. Sidney to watch over her.<br /><br />But with Pvt. Sidney's mind becoming more unstable, can the soldiers trust him to watch the woman?<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Fear and Desire\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1, black and white) and features the rare George Eastman House print that is mastered in HD from archival 35 mm elements newly restored by the Library of Congress.  For the most part, picture quality for this film is very good considering its age.  I detected no film warping, excessive blurring or a lot of scratches.  There are nicks and dust that can be seen but by no means, doesit prevent you from enjoying the film.  Whites and grays were well-contrast, black levels were inky and dark.  Overall, picture quality of \\"Fear and Desire\\" on Blu-ray is not pristine but the film looks great!<br /><br />As for \\"The Seafarers\\", the film is presented in color but definitely looks its age.  While in HD, it does have that feeling of early '50s documentary shorts.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Fear and Desire\\" is presented in monaural LPCM 2.0.  I detected no major hissing or pops during my viewing of \\"Fear and Desire\\".  Audio was clear and dialogue can be heard clearly with no problems whatsoever.  It's important to remember that this low-budget film was shot without sound and dialogue and effects were added during post production.<br /><br />There are no subtitles included on this Blu-ray release.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Fear and Desire\\" comes with Kubrick's 1953 short \\"The Seafarers\\" which was preserved by the Museum of Modern Art.  The Seafarers is a industrial documentary promoting the Seafarers International Union.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Fear and Desire\\", the first film by Stanley Kubrick that he never wanted people to see.<br /><br />Who can blame Kubrick?  Having a remarkable list of films in his oeuvre, his first film was seen by him as amateurish and low-budget.  And as a filmmaker, one can easily criticize their earliest work and would rather have people remember the popular films that he's known for, not his first film that he created at 24.<br /><br />But for cinema fans, \\"Fear and Desire\\" is fascinating American cinema for the fact that it shows that Stanley Kubrick was a filmmaker and writer that was ahead of his time.<br /><br />\\"Fear and Desire\\" is cleverly written to poke at America's continuing involvement in war.  And while \\"Fear and Desire\\" is not about the United States but people of an unknown country, Kubrick tries to relate one's feeling towards war, the futility of the actions of government and like its title, our soldiers that are sent to fight in a war instead of live for their families, are in fear of their lives being taken and their desire to survive another day.<br /><br />For Kubrick's first film, the use of cinematography and clever editing worked to the film's efficacy.  From the facial expressions and the eyes of the soldiers, the sight of a dead person as he grasps the food to show signs of life until no movement can be seen.  Also, closeups showcasing the sight of death or insanity for a character to wide angle shots showcasing the river and the wilderness.  Kubrick's cinematography was amazing to see at his young age and once again, showing how he was ahead of his time.<br /><br />Also, intriguing was the use of two characters playing the enemy.  Actors Kenneth Harp who plays Lt. Corby also plays the enemy general and Stephen Coit plays Pvt. Fletcher and the enemy captain.<br /><br />Kubrick utilizes each character effectively.  From the young woman (portrayed by Virginia Leith) with fear on her face as the unstable Pvt. Sidney starts to go insane and rubs his face all over her.  While a seen between Kenneth Harp's two characters who encounter each other is quite a memorable sight.<br /><br />For the most part, Stanely Kubrick was able to craft an intelligent film that pokes on society during that era on war.  Something he focuses a lot decades later in his film \\"Full Metal Jacket\\".<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release of \\"Fear and Desire\\", the fact that many people were exposed to bootlegs, because the film was never released should be happy that the 35 mm elements was restored and that Kubrick fans finally get their wish for an official video release.  Not only is the film restored but the film looks great on Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for the inclusion of \\"The Seafarers\\", it's more of an industrial documentary promoting the Seafarers International Union but for Kubrick fans, the short gives people a chance to see how a young Kubrickwas able to pay the bill sand eventually finance his next film, and that was taking on these type of jobs to earn money.<br /><br />So, you get the 1953 film and his short made that same year in this one Blu-ray release!  Just to get this rare gem, restored and presented on Blu-ray is fantastic!<br /><br />Overall, while Stanley Kubrick has many films in his oeuvre that will be forever known and loved by cinema fans, \\"Fear and Desire\\" is the legendary filmmaker's first feature film that provides an insightful look at a young Kubrick at work and how his work was ahead for its time.  Highly recommended!nment and like its title, our soldiers that are sent to fight in a war instead of live for their families, are in fear of their lives being taken and their desire to survive another day.<br /><br />For Kubrick's first film, the use of cinematography and clever editing worked to the film's efficacy.

0307586901|5.0|There are projects for holidays throughout the year, including Father's day and the 4th of July...most craft books that I've seen forget about the summertime holidays. Each holiday has cute, simple things that will be easy for most kids to make with a little adult assistance and there are beautiful projects that are a bit more complicated, but the instructions are easy to follow. I especially like the projects for Mother's day, Father's day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. We made one of the Christmas crafts in my kindergarten - 2nd grade Sunday school class and the kids really liked it.<br />I will definitely be using this book all year long!

B0088X7YU0|4.0|In 1959, writer Robert A. Heinlen created the military science fiction novel known as \\"Starship Troopers\\".  Serialized in \\"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\\", \\"Starship Troopers\\" was a major inspiration to writers, filmmakers and video game creators.<br /><br />In America, the influence of Heinlen's novel was incorporated to James Cameron's \\"Aliens\\" and would inspire the creation of three live action films, most notably the Paul Verhoeven film which diverged from the original novel.<br /><br />While in Japan, \\"Starship Troopers\\" was a major influence to anime creators.  Yoshiyuki Tomino, known for creating the legendary mecha series \\"Mobile Suit Gundam\\" has cited the novel as an inspiration and in 1988, Sunrise and Bandai Visual created a 6-episode anime OVA series titled \\"Uchu no Senshi\\" (which translates to \\"Starship Troopers\\"), a series that was faithful to Heinlen's original novel.<br /><br />The original novel was focused on a young soldier from the Philippines named Juan \\"Johnnie\\" Rico and his adventures as part of the Mobile Infantry and his rise in his military career during a time when mankind is in war against an arachnoid specials known as \\"The Bugs\\".<br /><br />With its acknowledged major influence to Japanese science fiction, nearly 25-years-later since the \\"Uchuu no Senshi\\" animated OVA series, \\"Starship Troopers\\" once again goes back to Japan for a CG-animated film titled \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\".  But this collaboration was also with the United States.<br /><br />Directed by Shinji Aramaki (\\"Appleseed\\", \\"\\"Megazone 23 Part III\\", \\"Genesis Survivor Gaiarth\\", \\"Bubblegum Crisis\\") and a man known for his work on many of the Japan's popular mecha anime hits, Aramaki's direction is based on the written work of Edward Neumeier (who wrote the previous films in the series) and executive producer and actor Casper Van Dien (best known for playing Johnny Rico in the live action films).  The animation and motion capturing was done in Japan courtesy of SOLA Digital Arts.<br /><br />The CG animated film would feature the return of characters Johnny Rico, Carl Jenkins and Carmen Ibanez but following the adventures of the A-1 Team.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />Having watched a good number of CG animation from Japan, it's always great to see how technology has continued to get better and better with the models and textures since the release of Shinji Aramaki's previous effort on \\"Appleseed\\".  There was no doubt that \\"Appleseed\\" broke new ground for CG animation in Japan and for Aramaki, he continues to be a major legend in the industry because of his work on the greatest mecha anime series and to have him work on \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is fantastic, if you are an anime fan!<br /><br />With SOLA Digital Arts, Inc. working on the animation and that the company literally flew all American actors to Japan for motion capturing, I'm just amazed how far CG animation has come since \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\\", \\"Final Fantasy: Advent Children\\" to the \\"Appleseed\\" related films to this current animated film, \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\".<br /><br />Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio), the film looks absolutely amazing in HD.  The detail of the characters show skin pores, the movements are not as jerky as they were years ago.  Movements are smooth, emotions of characters are much more evident and natural and there is this less blank look on the faces of the characters.<br /><br />From the characters to the aliens, they are heavily detailed, especially with mechanical design.  Aramaki's experience is in mechanical design, so it helps to have him as the driving force and getting people to give their 100% in making the vehicles look amazing.<br /><br />I didn't notice any banding or artifacts or edge enhancement.  If anything, the picture quality for \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is fantastic on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />The lossless soundtrack is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Spanish, Thai and Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The soundtrack was very good, with good use of the surround channels as this is an action-packed film featuring explosions, gunshots, laser blasts that come up often throughout the film.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear through the center and front channels.  But I wish the soundtrack was much more immersive.  I was hoping more more LFE and directional effects but I really felt the lossless soundtrack could have been a lot better for this series, as I had high expectations for \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" to be immersive for its sheer number of action scenes.<br /><br />The soundtrack also comes with quite a few language dubs but for the English lossless soundtrack, you have well-known anime voice talents such as Luci Christian, David Matranga and Emily Neves involved.  But for those hoping Casper Van Dien or other talents from the previous films voicing their roles, this is not the case for \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\".<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Chinese (Mandarin/Simplified and Traditional), Indonesia/Bahasa, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Filmmaker Commentary - Featuring the Japanese audio commentary with director Shinji Aramaki and Ishizuka of Sony Pictures.<br />  Conceptual Art Gallery - Featuring a slideshow of concept art<br />  Deleted Scenes - (1:36) Featuring two deleted scenes: \\"I Don't Like Funerals\\" and \\"Marzijon Wormhole\\".<br />  Gag Reel - (3:24) English voice dubbing outtakes<br />  The Making of \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" - (1:19:59) Featuring the making of the CG animated film broken down to the following parts that can be viewed separately or together: \\"Genesis\\", \\"Archive\\", \\"Character Design\\", \\"Motion Capture\\", \\"Power Suits\\", \\"Bugs\\", \\"Ships\\", \\"Backgrounds\\", \\"Compositing\\" and \\"Music\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to stream the film to computers, tablets or smartphones and download to your computer.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is a film that visually, looks great and non-stop action that fans of the genres will enjoy.<br /><br />But the film felt like I was watching cut scenes for a first-person shooter.  A storyline that focused so much on the action that very little was left of the plot.  What it turns out to be is another banal storyline of humanity trying to survive against an alien infestation, another film like \\"Aliens\\", like \\"Predator\\" and wondering which characters would ultimately survive.<br /><br />But \\"Starship Troopers\\", especially for the films, have been stories that deviated from the original novels, anyone expecting a return to Robert A. Heinlein's work may be disappointed, while those who grew up watching the Edward Neumeier written films will probably enjoy \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" a lot.  Especially anime fans who are used to seeing these type of action films.<br /><br />I want to make it clear that I enjoyed \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\".  For one, I was not expecting a deep storyline but I did enjoy the visual aspect of the film but also its characters.  Granted, a well-written plot and giving more depth and attention to character development would have made this film much deeper, but \\"Starship Troopers\\" to many people who have never read the novel is about warfare, about action and a storyline that is filled with sex and violence and team bravado as humanity takes on the aliens that continue to threaten them.<br /><br />Like the live-action films, there is a lot of violence in \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" as no matter how efficient the armor of the soldiers are, the aliens are even deadlier as soldiers are constantly getting impaled and no matter how many bullets hits these aliens, they are relentless.<br /><br />As for the sex, director Shinji Aramaki discusses in the audio commentary of how there were questions by female staff of how much nudity was featured in first half-hour of the film.  Literally, the three female characters which consist of Captain Carmen Ibanez, Ice Blonde and Trig are seen nude in the film.  And while some viewers will roll their eyes of the amount of female nudity this film has to offer, sex and violence will no doubt be its strength to a core demographic who love first person shooter video games and films with intense action.  It's how it is and Shinji Aramaki and Japanese crew followed Edward Neumeier's script to incorporate as much sex and violence as possible.<br /><br />But another reason why I enjoyed this film was its CG animation.  I have watched many CG animated films come from Japan and the technology continues to get better and better and I'm just in awe of how beautiful these CG renderings are and how much work went to making this film looks visually stunning.<br /><br />And on Blu-ray, the film looks absolutely fantastic but I wish the lossless soundtrack would have complimented the amount of action as seen in the film.  This film has so much action, I wanted immersiveness.  I wanted to feel these explosions and hear the directional fire coming from my surround and rear surround channels and bullets zipping from left to right and vice versa.  And I admit that I was a bit disappointed that with amazing visuals, the lossless soundtrack was not stellar as it could have been.  But you do get a number of special features that made the film worth its while and once again, I did enjoy it.<br /><br />I know already that by the look of this film alone, \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" was not cheap.  Having this collaboration between the East and West working together is great but at the same time, there is no doubt that this film needs to make its money back, especially if there are talks of how successful this film does, more will be made.<br /><br />It would be great if more can be made as I surely enjoyed this film much better than the second and third installment of the \\"Starship Troopers\\" films.  It's pretty much a popcorn action film that will appeal to \\"Starship Troopers\\" fans and also those who want to see an all-action, violent CG animated film and throw in the titillating nudity as well!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is an exciting CG animated film collaboration between Japan and the United States featuring non-stop action, amazing visuals and a fast-paced storyline.  It may not be deep and it may not satisfy those who are familiar with the original novel but it's still an entertaining CG animated film that action fans will definitely want to check out!br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to stream the film to computers, tablets or smartphones and download to your computer.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" is a film that visually, looks great and non-stop action that fans of the genres will enjoy.<br /><br />But the film felt like I was watching cut scenes for a first-person shooter.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game my kids got me hooked on it now I am teaching them things they didn't know lol
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Best fantasy book I've read in forever.  I've read this and the second book in the series over 5 times each and cant wait for the third installment.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|This book is much better than it's follow up.  Just a really good book with a lot of great information.  Yes, a few of the business ultimately failed, but that's because they lost their mission
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its fun until you run out of coins and have to wait. but i still play it. I personally wont spend money to buy coins
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a very enjoyable adventure game. Challenging, but not too much. The  map is very helpful in finding your way around, though it does not necessarily tell you a particular puzzle location. In retrospect, had I made note of each puzzle's location number as given on the map, I could have saved myself some stumbling around. Navigation couldn't be simpler - just tap where you want to go, or tap the item you want to pick up. All in all, this is a fun game.
B008CJ0KEM|4.0|In 2010, the Canadian supernatural crime drama known as \\"Lost Girl\\" premiered on Showcase.  Created by Michelle Lovretta and produced by Prodigy Pictures and Shaw Media, the series would go on to air in other countries in 2011 but in the United States, people had the opportunity to see \\"Lost Girl\\" in January 2012 on the Syfy channel.<br /><br />And now the first two seasons of \\"Lost Girl\\" is available on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Lost Girl: Season One\\" is presented at 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The series is shot in digital and for the most part, the series looks very good on Blu-ray!  Some scenes may be a bit soft but overall, the series features great detail on character closeups and black levels are nice and deep.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Lost Girl: Season One\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  For a TV series, \\"Lost Girl\\" features crystal clear dialogue but during its more action-intense scenes, the series utilizes the surround channels but also LFE.  It's important to note that an entire episode is not immersive, as the majority of an episode is primarily dialogue.  But when those action sequences do take place, that is when things become more immersive and for the most part, \\"Lost Girl\\" and its lossless soundtrack is well-done!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Lost Girl: Season One\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Interview Clips - The following interviews are with Anna Silk (Bo), Kris Holden-Reid (Dyson), Ksenia Solo (Kenzi), Zoei Palmer (Lauren), Rick Howland (Trick), K.C. Collins (Hale), Michelle Lovretta (creator of \\"Lost Girl\\"), Jay Firestone (Executive Producer), Peter Monahan (Executive Producer), Anne Dixon (Costume Designer), David Greene (Director of Photography),, Ian Brock (Production Designer).  I wish the interviews were presented as straight through interviews, but they broken up interviews via segments which are not that long.<br />  Behind the Scenes - Featuring ten short behind-the-scenes clips.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />A very cool and sexy supernatural drama... you will be hooked!<br /><br />When \\"Lost Girl\\" first appeared on the SyFy channel, my first impressions was a modern take on \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" minus the Scooby gang!<br /><br />The concept of Fae's with different supernatural abilities living alongside humans and two different factions that are opposed to each other, is quite fascinating, if you are into supernatural dramas.  But what makes \\"Lost Girl\\" so cool is its characters.<br /><br />The character of Bo reminds me of Buffy, in the fact that she's beautiful, sexy and can fight!  But unlike Buffy, she is not human, she is a succubus.  But unlike other Fae, she chooses to side with humanity, not choosing one Fae side, she lives her life, the best she can.<br /><br />Actress Anna Silk exhibits a side that looks so gentle and pure but then later transforms into a vixen that can seduce.<br /><br />Add the character of Kenzi, the spunky, blunt sidekick who no doubt says what she wants and does what she wants, but yet having the approval and friendship of Bo. Actress Ksenia Solo is excellent for the role and the costume design of this character of having her in different wigs, with different looks but yet maintaining this dark yet spunky image, is very cool!<br /><br />These two characters are very fun to watch and then you add the man-wolf, Dyson into the mix and things get a bit exciting.<br /><br />Unlike other supernatural dramas on television, \\"Lost Girl\\" features profanity and is not afraid to be sexy without having to showcase nudity.  Sure you see a little T&A but its supernatural fan service and audiences who enjoy watching Bo will no doubt be thrilled.<br /><br />I use the comparison with Joss Whedon's \\"Angel\\" in terms of the investigative angle of the series.  Both Bo and Kenzi take on cases,which typically are related to Fae's, may it be homicide or abduction cases and more or less, we see the growth of Bo as a character trying to learn about herself and control her abilities (primarily, her thirst of feeding on a person).<br /><br />So, while the investigative cases plays a big part of the \\"Lost Girl\\" storyline, so does its theme of sexuality.<br /><br />Bo needs to feed and Dyson, a wolf-shifter, doesn't mind Bo making out with him or having sexual encounters just enough to feed her.<br /><br />And of course, it causes concern for Dyson as he knows he shouldn't be having any emotional connection to her because she has not pledged her allegiance to any Fae side.<br /><br />Then you have Lauren Lewis, the doctor and scientist who wants to help Bo carve her craving to feed.  But at the same time, there is a deep attraction between her and Bo.<br /><br />Suffice to say, Bo tends to be able to touch people and make them want to be with her.  Succubus abilities that need to be conquered when her body needs to feed and an ability she is trying to control.<br /><br />The first season of \\"Lost Girl\\" is quite entertaining and with only 13-episodes for the first season, by the season finale, all hell breaks loose and no doubt will set the pace for Bo in the second season.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Lost Girl\\" looks very good on Blu-ray and the lossless track is actually pretty good considering a lot of series are front-channel driven.  As for special features, it looks like there is a lot, but for some reason, each Q&A is separated as an individual interview feature.  I wish they just had the interviews with the option of \\"play all\\" versus of having to select each interview one by one, because some of them are just too short!  Better yet, why not one full interview with each cast or crew, instead of breaking up the interviews questions.  This also goes for the \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" which are short but no option to \\"play all\\".<br /><br />Other than that, \\"Lost Girl: Season One\\" was a lot of better than I expected and I'm looking forward to season 2.  Not all Canadian supernatural series do all that well in the U.S., \\"Blood Ties\\" while popular in Canada, fizzled in the U.S.  But I think it does help for \\"Lost Girl\\" that it is presented on the Syfy channel versus \\"Lifetime\\", the cable channel that \\"Blood Ties\\" was featured.<br /><br />But while there are similarities to shows such as \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" with \\"Lost Girl\\", it's a totally different series and because it is shown on cable, writers can utilize mature language and feature more sexuality which is part of the efficacy of \\"Lost Girl\\".<br /><br />A mature, sexy and action-packed supernatural series... \\"Lost Girl: Season One\\" is recommended!which typically are related to Fae's, may it be homicide or abduction cases and more or less, we see the growth of Bo as a character trying to learn about herself and control her abilities (primarily, her thirst of feeding on a person).<br /><br />So, while the investigative cases plays a big part of the \\"Lost Girl\\" storyline, so does its theme of sexuality.<br /><br />Bo needs to feed and Dyson, a wolf-shifter, doesn't mind Bo making out with him or having sexual encounters just enough to feed her.<br /><br />And of course, it causes concern for Dyson as he knows he shouldn't be having any emotional connection to her because she has not pledged her allegiance to any Fae side.<br /><br />Then you have Lauren Lewis, the doctor and scientist who wants to help Bo carve her craving to feed.

B005CKPQNE|5.0|One of the best shows on TV. Cant wait till the next episodes come out for season 5. Just watch the show and you'll see what Im talking about.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|First I have to say for my personal favorite Avenger, he should have been portrayed by Edward Norton in The Avengers as well. Nothing against Mark but once Edward played him, he and the original Bill are who I see when I think Hulk. My irrelevant comments out of the way, I have to say that this was a great movie and if you have a Blu Ray player / PS3 (I do) or a 3D capable TV (I Don't), this is the best way to watch this movie outside of a theater. On top of that , you look at the price for the set where you get a downloadable copy, DVD, Blu ray and 3D version and you just can't beat it! I highly recommend this product!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game for the brain. I would recommend<br />this game for all ages. Can not stop playing.

B004D9FLJE|5.0|I was wanting all the seasons of Glee. This was the first to buy really good at a pretty good price.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\", the award winning young adult novel by American television writer and novelist Suzanne Collins.<br /><br />Inspired by watching a competition on reality TV and the invasion of Iraq, the Greek myth of Theseus and Roman gladiator games, \\"The Hunger Games\\" received rave reviews in 2008 by film critics but also criticized for its similarity to Koushun Takami's 1999 novel \\"Battle Royale\\" and Stephen King's \\"The Running Man\\" and \\"The Long Walk\\".<br /><br />But despite its criticism, \\"The Hunger Games\\" did receive a number of awards and honors in 2008and would go on to receive a film adaptation courtesy of Lions Gate Entertainment and produced by Nina Jacobson's production Company Color Force. The film adaptation was done by Suzanne Collins with help from screenwriter Billy Ray (\\"Color of Night\\", \\"State of Play\\", \\"Flightplan\\") and also featured a collaboration with filmmaker Gary Ross (\\"Big\\", \\"Pleasantville\\", \\"Seabiscuit\\"). Ross would direct the film and would work with cinematographer Tom Stern (\\"Gran Torino\\", \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Mystic River\\") and feature music composed by James Newton Howard (\\"The Sixth Sense\\", \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"Unbreakable\\").<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" would star actress Jennifer Lawrence (\\"X-Men: First Class\\", \\"Winter's Bone\\", \\"Like Crazy\\"), Josh Hutcherson (\\"Bridge to Terabithia\\", \\"The Kids Are All Right\\", \\"American Splendor\\"), Woody Harrelson (\\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"Zombieland\\", \\"Natural Born Killers\\", \\"Cheers\\"), Donald Sutherland (\\"The Italian Job\\", \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", \\"Ordinary People\\"), Liam Hemsworth (\\"Last Song\\", \\"Knowing\\", \\"Triangle\\"), Elizabeth Banks (\\"Zack and Miri Make a Porno\\", \\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\\", \\"The Next Three Days\\"), Stanley Tucci (\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", \\"The Terminal\\", \\"The Lovely Bones\\"), Wes Bentley (\\"American Beauty\\", \\"The Four Feathers\\") and rock star Lenny Kravitz (\\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\\", \\"Previous\\", \\"Bad Boys II\\").<br /><br />The film which was budgeted at $78 million would become an enormous success in the box office, earning over $684 million surpassing \\"Eclipse\\" for the record of first-day advanced ticket sales and became the largest opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or holiday.  The film would receive favorable reviews from film critics, although similar to the novel, would be compared to its similarities with the Japanese film \\"Battle Royale\\".<br /><br />And now, \\"The Hunger Games\\" has been released on Blu-ray and DVD.  The 2-disc Blu-ray comes with a digital copy, while the 2-disc DVD also comes with a digital copy and the film will also be available On Demand.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 Widescreen Presentation).  Its important to note that the \\"The Hunger Games\\" was shot on film and not digitally.  Shot in North Carolina, there was artificial coloring used in order to make Katniss' area seem lush.  But its when the characters leave their district, we see how beautiful this film looks.  From the closeups of the characters, the detail in their costume design and even the use of visual effects throughout the film, the picture quality looked absolutely fantastic.<br /><br />During my viewing, especially in scenes with a lot of red, I saw no banding, I saw no artifacts nor did I see any problematic issues with this film.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" is crisp, vibrant and looks absolutely amazing on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 2.0 Dolby Digital Audio Optimized for Late-Night Listening, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio,  I have to say that the 7.1 lossless soundtrack is absolutely immersive.  I was amazed of how sound was utilized, may it be for the sound of a spacecraft flying above, canons being shot, the crowd screaming all around you.  This is an immersive soundtrack in which the surround channels are effectively used, especially LFE.  There is no doubt that audiophiles will enjoy this lossless soundtrack.  It's fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH or Spanish Subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  The World is Watching: Making the Hunger Games - (2:02:00) The making of \\"The Hunger Games\\" featuring an eight-part documentary: Countdown, Casting, Design, Arena Ready, On Location in Panem, Effects, Post-Production, May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favor<br />  Game Maker: Suzanne Collins and the Hunger Games Phenomenon - (14:05) David Levithan (publisher of Scholastic, Inc.), book reviewers and educators talk about \\"The Hunger Games\\" phenomenon.<br />  Letters from the Rose Garden - (9:08) Interview with director Gary Ross and Donald Sutherland.  Sutherland talks about taking part in \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br />  Controlling the Games - (5:50) Interviews with those involved with the visual effects and production design for \\"The Hunger Games\\".<br />  A Conversation with Gary Ross and Elvis Mitchell - (14:31) Film critic Elvis Mitchell interviews Gary Ross.<br />  Preparing for The Games: A Director's Process (Blu-ray Exclusive) - (3:00) Director Gary Ross talks about his shot list, planning the film and a storyboard/screenplay comparison.<br />  Propaganda Film - (1:34) The propaganda film shown to the districts (full, non-interrupted).<br />  Marketing Archive - Featuring the theatrical trailers (sneak peek, theatrical trailer, second trailer), poster and photo galleries.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" comes with a slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />OK, I admit it.  I was wrong.<br /><br />I was wrong to not to have interest in this film because of a few saying it was a \\"Battle Royale\\" knock off.<br /><br />I was wrong not to have watched this film because my wife loved it so much, she wanted to see it again (and this never happens).  She loved it so much, she read all the books and was enthusiastic enough to recommend a movie to me (which rarely happens).<br /><br />But when a movie does so well, receives its praise and also its controversial criticism, I figured that I needed to see what all the hype was all about.  See it for myself and decide.<br /><br />And after watching \\"The Hunger Games\\", I can tell you right now that I absolutely...loved it!<br /><br />Granted, I'm a sucker for underdog type films.  Humanity being oppressed and someone to stand up and fight back.  We see it so much with male action heroes but here we are with a film with a strong female character.  But most importantly, director Gary Ross was able to transform Suzanne Collins novel to the big screen.<br /><br />From the visual effects and production design, I immediately took notice to see how the children were dressed when they headed out to the lottery.  I took notice of the makeup of Effie Trinket, so different from others with her outlandish costume design but yet separating her from the people of the district.  From seeing how those selected to battle being part of the opening ceremonies to the viciousness of the battles that took place.  The storyline is so effective and you automatically pull for the underdog.<br /><br />And yes, there are similarities to \\"Battle Royale\\" and even \\"The Running Man\\", but that's not to say that \\"The Hunger Games\\" was inspired by these films, as Suzanne Collins was not.  The fact is that we live in a society where reality TV has now become prime time television.  People love to see the underdogs win.  People love to see television taking things up a notch in order to surprise viewers and not succumb to last year and previous year's banal circumstances.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games\\" is sleek in style but pays off in character portrayal.  First, let's talk about the visual style.<br /><br />Director Gary Ross was able to take Suzanne Collins but build upon its story through visual effects.  Letting people know that the Capitol is responsible for this faux arena.  They are able to manipulate the games through technology, to effectively communicate with their viewers who are pulling for their district, but also seeing how those in competition must win over sponsors.  The way things were paced and executed was wonderfully done and the costume design, makeup, set design made this sci-fi film believable and effective.<br /><br />But of course, you like any film or video game that can have a flashy presentation, it's characters are important.<br /><br />And that is where \\"The Hunger Games\\" wins over the viewer through its characters that are children fighting to survive.  Automatically, you get a good feeling of who is going to die.  When you see young kids, with no exceptional skills and are forced to fight but are in fear of being killed against older, much experienced teens, it's heartbreaking.<br /><br />All of these characters are vulnerable, but yet they fight for not themselves but their district, ensuring that their district can be fed for a year.  We see how the Capitol, especially through its President tries to manipulate the system, we see how the people of the districts are powerless and we see how these characters must put on a brave face and essentially market themselves to viewers in order to win over sponsors.<br /><br />Where \\"The Running Man\\" was more about action and \\"Battle Royale\\" was more interesting of seeing how many violent ways teens can be killed, \\"The Hunger Games\\" does feature violence but it's not the primary focus.<br /><br />It was important to have an actress that is not a perfect hero, a character that is vulnerable and this is where actress Jennifer Lawrence shined as Katniss Everdeen.  Yes, she has experience as tracker and a hunter but she is also a young woman who doesn't want to die.  Who wants to live for her family and be back for her sister.  And the way that Lawrence plays Katniss, is so convincing, so pure and just wonderful.  Yes, I am aware of the criticism of how the poor districts have people who must be thin and starving and that should reflect in the casting of its character.  But I've looked at it as her skills of a hunter allowed her and her family to eat.  Not everyone is a skilled hunter, she is.<br /><br />We have her fellow district mate, Peeta Mellark, who has no major fighting skills, aside from working in a bakery and throwing flour and also knowing how to paint himself in order to disguise himself, so he would not be caught.  But then you have this romantic angle, with Peeta who has had a long crush on Katniss.  And part of you is pulling for him to also survive.  Actor Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta has come a long way as a child star and now a teen actor and to see how this actor has grown so much since starring in \\"Little Manhattan\\" and \\"Bridge to Terabithia\\".<br /><br />Woody Harrelson was also great in playing the District 12 mentor, Haymitch Abernathy.  Thinking that his kids don't have a chance but then seeing Katniss' resilience and believing in her.  It was an interesting role to see Harrelson play but it turned out pretty good.<br /><br />And there are many more characters that are notable, talent who did a good job playing their characters.  Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, Amandla Stenberg to name a few.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and the lossless audio was fantastic.  I don't think videophiles or audiophiles have anything to complain about this film.  As for special features, you get a lengthy making of featurette but also plenty of other shorter special features included.  The Blu-ray release comes with two Blu-rays, one for the film and the other for the special features but also a digital copy via Ultraviolet is included.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Hunger Games\\" was a film that I didn't want to see because of its comparisons to \\"Battle Royale\\" but I realized that I was wrong to even think that way.  Not only is the film fantastic but while there are similarities to \\"Battle Royale\\" and \\"The Running Man\\", this film is much more effective in how the characters are portrayed.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing and well-cast for her role as Katniss and I will never understand why one would complain about young Black talents such as Amandla Stenberg playing  Rue or Dayo Okenyi playing Thresh.  It's unimaginable that people complained about it and refuse to see the movie because of it.  Unimaginable but also another lesson that even though society has changed a lot in the last 50 years, ignorance still exists.  While the character of Thresh had a small part in this film, the character of Rue and Amandla Stenberg played this character magnificently and felt the character of Rue and her interaction with Katniss was one of the most important, unforgettable scenes of the film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Hunger Games\\" was a film that was pulse-pounding, exciting and all-out entertaining!  Not only was it an effective sci-fi film but it's been a long while since I watched a new sci-fi film that made me excited for the upcoming sequels and yes, even making me want to read the books.  I enjoyed the film that much!<br /><br />And while I have no doubt that the Blu-ray and DVD release of \\"The Hunger Games\\" will be an amazing success for Lions Gate Entertainment, I'm also confident in highly recommending this Blu-ray release.  It's a must buy!l is responsible for this faux arena.  They are able to manipulate the games through technology, to effectively communicate with their viewers who are pulling for their district, but also seeing how those in competition must win over sponsors.  The way things were paced and executed was wonderfully done and the costume design, makeup, set design made this sci-fi film believable and effective.<br /><br />But of course, you like any film or video game that can have a flashy presentation, it's characters are important.<br /><br />And that is where \\"The Hunger Games\\" wins over the viewer through its characters that are children fighting to survive.

B007USWD0U|5.0|In cinema, there have been filmmakers in their own countries that were known to take on the bourgeois society and the wealthy with humor but also a message.  Rainer Werener Fassbinder of Germany was one such filmmaker known for being polemic in his approach to his films.<br /><br />But since Fassbinder's death in 1982, seven years later, a Finnish filmmaker named Aki Kaurism&auml;ki would capture the world's attention through his film \\"Leningrad Cowboys Go America\\".  People saw the beginning of a filmmaker with a lot of potential and sure enough, by 2002, Kaurism&auml;ki would write and direct the film \\"The Man Without a Past\\", as part of his Finland Trilogy (which included \\"Drifting Clouds\\" (1996) and \\"Lights in the Dusk\\" (2006), his comedy would be nominated for an Academy Award for \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\" (which he refused to attend the event because he didn't want to party in a nation in a current state of war) and would win the \\"FIPRESCI Prize\\" and \\"the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury (special mention\\" at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival.<br /><br />Kaurism&auml;ki also grew admiration for his protests, may it be against George W. Bush's foreign policy or a show of solidarity by not attending the 40th New York Film Festival because Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami was not given a US Visa in time for the festival.<br /><br />In 2011, Kaurism&auml;ki went to work on his second French film titled \\"Le Havre\\", the first since his 1992 film \\"La vie de boheme\\".  The film would star Andre Wilms (\\"Europa Europa\\", \\"La vie de boheme\\", \\"Monsieur Hire\\"), Kati Outinen (\\"The Man Without a Past\\", \\"The Match Factory Girl\\", \\"Drifting Clouds\\"), Jean-Pierre Darroussin (\\"Red Lights\\", \\"A Very Long Engagement\\", \\"Family Resemblances\\") and Blondin Miguel.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Le Havre - The Criterion Collection #619″ is a film presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1 aspect ratio).  The film looks absolutely magnificent on Blu-ray!<br /><br />From the beauty of the port city as seen through cinematographer Timo Salminen showcasing a saddened Issidra looking towards the ocean, to the detail of closeups of each character, the film features warm and cooler colors with the look of Le Havre looking amazing throughout the film.  Black levels are nice and deep and there is also a good amount of grain as well.<br /><br />Considering most cities tend to showcase the more industrial aspects of Le Havre, this film real showcases the details and beauty of the city thanks to the film's clarity in HD.<br /><br />I didn't notice any banding issues nor any artifact problems during my viewing of \\"Le Havre\\".  Overall, my feeling is that most cinema fans will enjoy the look of \\"Le Havre\\" on Blu-ray!  It's a beautiful film!<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the Blu-ray release was approved by director Aki Kaurism&auml;ki, the new high-definition digital transfer was created on an ARRISCAN film scanner from the 35 mm interpositive.  Minor scratches and dust were removed using Image Systems' Nucoda and Autodesk's Flame.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Le Havre - The Criterion Collection #619″ is primarily a dialogue-driven film with a pleasing musical soundtrack. Presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, while the dialogue is crystal clear, the film also utilizes the surround channels for ambiance.  So, the sounds of Le Havre, from children playing, people talking, you can hear it through the surround channels, so it adds to the beauty of \\"Le Havre\\" via audio and capturing the feel of being in the port city.<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the film features a fully digital 5.1 surround soundtrack.  The audio for this release was mastered at 24-bit from the original digital audio master files using Pro Tools HD.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Le Havre - The Criterion Collection #619\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Le Havre at Cannes - (45:02) The press conference for \\"Le Havre\\" featuring Aki Kaurism&auml;ki and the cast answering questions at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.<br />  Interview - (11:40) Featuring a live TV interview with Aki Kaurism&auml;ki  and a few of the cast members at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.<br />  Andre Wilms - (13:08) An exclusive interview with Andre Wilms and the Criterion Collection shot in April 2012.<br />  Kati Outinen - (48:08) Featuring an interview with actress Kati Outinen from the Finnish television show \\"Mansikkapaikka\\".<br />  Little Bob in Concert - (8:15) Featuring the full performances of Little Bob performing two songs at Le Havre in May 2010.<br />  Trailer  - (2:19) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Le Havre\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Le Havre - The Criterion Collection #619\\" comes with a 28-page booklet with the following essays \\"Always Be a Human\\" by Michael Sicinski, \\"A Place of Peace: Aki Kaurism&auml;ki discusses \\"Le Havre\\" with Peter Von Bagh.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Delightful, intelligent and dare I say, heartwarming film from Aki Kaurism&auml;ki!<br /><br />\\"Le Havre\\" is possibly unlike other Kaurism&auml;ki films, its not dark, nor is it polemic but its eccentric humor to go along with its focus on human relations is quite amazing.<br /><br />In these days of worrying about the economy, worrying about surviving, the protagonist Marcel is a man who works hard as a shoeshiner to make his living and provide for him and his wife.  No complaints whatsoever.<br /><br />His friends no he is fortunate to have a good wife in Arletty, but Arletty is sick and possibly not going to live that much longer.<br /><br />But where most films would focus on the emotional aspect of a man losing his wife or the sadness that is typically banal in films that exploring death of a loved one or how a couple is affected, this is not that type of film.<br /><br />Arletty when discussing her illness to her doctor, explains how no miracles exists to the people in her neighborhood.<br /><br />Perhaps there is a growing complacency among the people of Le Havre, living the same life, day in and day out.<br /><br />But for Marcel, that life is changed when he meets a young African boy named Idrissa.  We see Marcel and even his friends in the neighborhood getting a breath of new life as they try to hide and protect this young boy from being capture by police and the inspector.<br /><br />And while the film is not groundbreaking, nor is it too realistic (there are many positive things that people do to help the boy, too bad society not always react with this much positivity in helping a person to such extremes), the way the film is told, the hope and caring nature of what we see visually is what captivates you.  Longtime cinematographer for Kaurism&auml;ki, Timo Salminen and editor Timo Linnasalo, continues to bring beauty and natural rhythm to Kaurism&auml;ki's films.<br /><br />As for the performers, it's great to see talents such as Andre Wilms (reprising the role of an older Marcel, a character first featured in the 1992 film \\" La vie de boh&egrave;me\\").  Also, great to see Kati Outinen once again in a Kaurism&auml;ki films.  Despite not having a lot of scenes, Outinen's Arletty does play a pivotal role in the life of Marcel.  And also Jean-Pierre Darroussin does a great job in portraying the suspicious inspector!<br /><br />And fortunately the film doesn't call for young Blondin Miguel to have an emotional scene.  That is one thing that is Hollywood banality and that is to showcase an emotional scene with a child, but for the most part, this boy is trying his darnedest to be strong for Marcel.  And for this child actor, in his first major role, Blondin does a great job of playing a boy who is alone, lonely and has to put his faith into a group of people he doesn't know.<br /><br />It is a heartwarming storyline in some way, but it's about how these individuals will achieve helping him, while the police and the inspector are scouring all over Le Havre for him.  But its efficacy lies within Kaurism&auml;ki's storytelling and unexpectedness.  And it is great to see something original and not so banal.  I really enjoyed this film a lot!<br /><br />The Blu-ray release of \\"Le Hare\\" is gorgeous.  Kaurism&auml;ki shows no intention of working in digital and so, the film looks natural with its warm to cool colors throughout the film.  Lossless audio is appropriate with this film utilizing a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 French soundtrack with crystal clear dialogue and good use of surround for the film's ambiance.  And there is a good amount of special features included on this Blu-ray release as well!  In fact, I was very pleased by the inclusion of these special features (and thank goodness they are long and not short), which gives viewers an idea of Aki Kaurism&auml;ki's thought process of making the film but also the perspectives of both Andre Wilms and Kati Outinen who have the experience of working with him.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Le Havre\\" is a delightful, smart, happy ending type-of-film for Aki Kaurism&auml;ki.  A delightfully charming film that captures the good in people's hearts but yet done in a way that is not too cheesy or unnecessary.  It's a film with a non-preaching, positive message not about just helping people but to not get bog down with the negative things that occur in the world today.  Find acceptance and help others who need you.<br /><br />\\"Le Havre\\" is highly recommended!/>Perhaps there is a growing complacency among the people of Le Havre, living the same life, day in and day out.<br /><br />But for Marcel, that life is changed when he meets a young African boy named Idrissa.

141659521X|1.0|I have read all the Vince Flynn books. This one was sterling until the dog at the end. A more elegant solution could have been found. One that would have shown a unique side to our hero. That blew the whole thing for me. I have spent 40 years in government service and never saw anything like that.
B008JEJPSC|4.0|It began with an 1885 poem by James Whitcomb Riley and led to a 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray, \\"Little Orphan Annie\\" was a series that may have focused on a young orphan girl, but the storyline was geared for adults as it was political.<br /><br />But by 1930, when the storyline was made into a radio show and in 1977 when it was made into a Broadway musical, suffice to say, Annie became part of America's pop culture and known for songs such as \\"Tomorrow\\", \\"Maybe\\" and \\"It's the Hard-Knock Life\\".<br /><br />So, with the Broadway production of \\"Annie\\" coming to a close, in 1982, Columbia Pictures released \\"Annie\\" based on the Broadway musical.  Directed by actor/filmmaker John Huston (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\", \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\", \\"The African Queen\\"), the film would star an ensemble cast which included Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Geoffrey Holder, Edward Herrman and the film debut of Aileen Quinn.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1 aspect ratio).  While the film slightly has that aged '80s film look, outdoor scenes look vibrant, Annie's red dress to anything with bold colors tend to really pop.  And you can see the stubble of Albert Finney's bald head.  But for the most part, this is probably the best that anyone is going to see of \\"Annie\\".  I didn't notice any artifact problems or severe DNR.  There was a fine layer of grain and for the most part, the film does look on Blu-ray.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA, Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital, Italian LCRS Discrete Surround, French, German, Spanish Stereo.  The film is primarily a musical and features dialogue.  Because it's an older film, I expected it to be more of a front channel soundtrack and I was right.  The dialogue and music is crystal clear and with songs that feature bass, there is a good dynamic range when it comes to the musical soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Annie: 30th Anniversary - Sing-Along Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Sing-Along  - For those who want to sing-along to the film or a song, an exclusive for the Blu-ray is the sing-along (ala karaoke) for the musical scenes of the film.<br />  My Hollywood Adventure with Aileen Quinn - (12:04) Aileen Quinn reminisces of her time filming \\"Annie\\" and featuring video clips of behind-the-scenes of the making of the film and the promotion for \\"Annie\\".  Note: This is the same featurette for the 20th Anniversary of\\"Annie\\".<br />  Trailer and TV Spots - Featuring the theatrical trailer, the behind the scenes making of the theatrical trailer and three TV spots.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Back in the early '80s, \\"Annie\\" was one of the first films I watched on cable.  At the time, \\"Annie\\" was a big part of American culture thanks to the Broadway play and the music.<br /><br />While \\"Annie\\" may not be as well-known for younger audiences of today or even young adults of today, \\"Annie\\" was one of those feel-good, rags-to-riches story featuring memorable music and at the time, a commanding performance by wonderful talents such as Carol Burnett, Bernadette Peters but also from Albert Finney and Tim Curry.  But the film's true talents were young Aileen Quinn and the magnificent song and dance performances by Ann Reinking.<br /><br />The look and the feel of the film felt like New York during the 1920′s and the direction by filmmaker and actor John Huston was rather well-done.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, for those who want to sing along with the music or learn the lyrics, can easily do so with the exclusive \\"Sing-Along\\" feature.  And for those who don't own the previous\\"Annie\\" releases, will surely enjoy watching an older Aileen Quinn discussing her experience of working on the film and the various talents at the time.  As for video and audio quality, there is no doubt that this is the best version of \\"Annie\\" to date.  While I wish there was more use of the music for the surround channels, it's still crystal clear coming from the center and front channels.  While the picture quality didn't look too aged or feature heavily use of DNR.<br /><br />But what it comes down to is one's nostalgic memories of \\"Annie\\" or one wanting to watch a family friendly musical on Blu-ray.  I used this film as an actual introduction to musicals for my nine-year-old, but the concept of why characters were continually singing and dancing and not enough conversation made him a bit impatient.  But I suppose growing up and being exposed to live musicals, especially watching \\"The Carol Burnett Show\\" as a young child of the '70s, helped ease me to appreciating \\"Annie\\" a bit more.<br /><br />Overall, Annie\\" is a family film filled with memorable music, wonderful dance choreography with a talented ensemble cast.  But also featuring  a heartwarming rags-to-riches story that families can easily appreciate and enjoy.\\"Annie\\" releases, will surely enjoy watching an older Aileen Quinn discussing her experience of working on the film and the various talents at the time.

B0084IHVC0|4.0|\\"The Aristocats\\", one of Disney's cute, fun, classic animated films that will no doubt entertaining generation after generation.<br /><br />In 1970, the 20th Walt Disney Animated Classic was released in theaters.  The film, \\"The Aristocats\\", would be known as the last film project that Walt Disney approved before his death in 1966 and a film that would feature Disney's longtime legendary talent known as the  \\"Nine Old Men\\".<br /><br />Featuring talents such as Eva Gabor, singer Phil Harris and English actor Roddy Maude-Roxby, the film would be an enormous success that year. Budgeted at $4 million, \\"The Aristocats\\" would earn over $55 million in the box office.<br /><br />And now, the classic Disney animated film was released in HD for the first time on Blu-ray in August 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"The Aristocats\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1 aspect ratio).  This is one of the classic Disney films to feature Disney's legendary \\"Nine Old Men\\" and has a unique style as the characters look as they are hand drawn, as the outlines of the pencil strokes can be seen on the cats.<br /><br />The detailed and beautiful backgrounds also reflect a sketch style mostly evident indoors, but outdoors, it's Disney magic as the backgrounds look fantastic!  These outdoor animated scenes are where you can see most of the detail and the vibrancy of the film.  While the film does seem like an older animated film in presentation with its hint of softness, this is the best version of \\"The Aristocats\\" that I have seen so far.<br /><br />The picture quality is quite clean, there are no blemishes, artifacts or dust that I saw when I was watching the film.  Overall, I was impressed by how great this film looks on Blu-ray!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"The Aristocats\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. The film is primarily dialogue and music-driven and thus more center/front channel. Dialogue and lossless audio is crystal clear with a little use of the surround channels but there is use of LFE (as it can be heard a bit clearly during the train sequence). But overall, the lossless soundtrack is good and I hear no pops or any audio problems during my viewing of the film.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"The Aristocats\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  The Lost Open - (9:31) Richard Sherman talks about the deleted character Elvira and two deleted songs which are presented in this special feature.<br />  \\"Oui Oui Marie\\" Music Video - (1:53) A modernized remix featuring little cat, Marie's quotes.<br />  Classic Deleted Song: \\"She Never Felt Alone\\" - (7:56) A featurette on how the Sherman Brothers came up with \\"She Never Felt Alone\\".<br />  The Sherman Brothers: The Aristocats of Disney Songs - (4:20) A featurette on the Sherman Brothers and their collaboration with Disney.<br />  The Aristocats Scrapbook - A gallery of images from \\"The Aristocats\\".<br />  The Great Cat Family (Excerpt) - (12:51) An animated short on \\"The Great Cat Family\\".  Original air date on Sept. 19, 1956.<br />  Bonus Short: Bath Day - (6:39) An animated short featuring Figaro.<br />  Play Movie with On-Screen Lyrics - Ability to have a karaoke-style singalong during the film (for music segments only).<br />  Disney Song Selection - (10:44) Featuring the song selections for \\"The Aristocats\\", \\"Scales and Arpeggios\\", \\"Thomas O'Malley Cat\\", \\"Ev'rybody Wants to be a Cat\\".<br />  Disney Virtual Kitten - Adopt your own Virtual Kitty.  Featuring two mini games and your very own printable adoption license.<br />  The Aristocats Fun with Language Game - Play along and learn the names and sounds of a variety of musical instruments.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"The Aristocats\\" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of both films.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When I first watched \\"The Aristocats\\" as a child, I think anyone who watched it, just felt the cats were so cute, especially hearing little Marie talk and sing or seeing oldest kitten, Toulouse trying to be a tough kitten, while little Berlioz is shy.  But for the most part, it's a straightforward story about a cat and her kittens lost in the middle of nowhere, in the countryside outside of Paris.  And the hero, Thomas O'Malley willing to help Duchess and her kittens get back home.<br /><br />But during the process through their adventures of returning home, Thomas and Duchess fall in love and even the kittens start to take a liking towards Thomas, as if he was their father.<br /><br />\\"The Aristocats\\" is a fun, yet short animated film that families will love.  Granted, it is a little dark when you read that Edgard the Butler is trying to kill the cats, but the way it is presented in the film, it's more comical and there is no scenes that show any violence.  If anything, Egard is quite inept, so aside from the cats falling off the car and being stranded in the countryside, there are no scenes of any abuse that parents need to worry about.<br /><br />It's a safe, straightforward family film that a new generation of fans or the young at heart can enjoy.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the film looks absolutely wonderful in HD.  This is an older 1970 animated film and while there is a hint of softness which is appropriate for a film this old, the film also showcases a unique style to it.  From the heavy strokes outside of the characters and everything looking sketched but yet colorful and well-detailed when it comes to objects and scenery, \\"The Aristocats\\" looks great on Blu-ray and dialogue and music are crystal clear.  The Blu-ray release also features quite a few songs and featurette including a bonus animated short of \\"Bath Day\\".<br /><br />Also, included along with this Blu-ray release is a DVD version of the film, which is great for vacation time and parents wanting to keep their kids occupied at home or during a commute.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Aristocats\\" is an easily accessible film for children and it's not too long (at 78-minutes).

B0029ZA3H4|5.0|Great read for anyone looking for inspiration or trying to improve their business. Straight forward approach, well written. Good Purchase.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Rock of Ages is simply a lot of fun! Possibly it helps if you were a child in the 80s like me or were older to appreciate the music even more and just relive decent music again, and throw in the whole nostalgia factor too. I also can't imagine younger audiences who have embraced the TV show Glee and various karaoke style reality TV shows like no generation before with unknowns singing cover songs of classic songs won't love this too. There is no great detailed storyline in the plot, it's simply your basic girl who is a big fish in a small pond moves to the big city and bright lights where it isn't as simple to achieve her dreams as she thought. Nice city guy with similar dreams who's been working hard to make it himself and becomes interested in her, then throw in unethical evil type manager of big star whose let fame go to his head and doesn't want his cash cow put back on track no matter how it is obviously affecting that stars longevity.  Sure those story threads have been done time and time again but the actors in Rock of Ages do it again nicely.  Like with Glee and musicals turned into movies, yes you can tell they are lip syncing to studio recorded songs at times, maybe even more so than most in this one, but you've got to remember the original artists of the songs they are singing cover versions of, had obvious cheesy lip syncing going as well in the original song film clips so it is sort of paying homage to them in some way.  The actors do a pretty good job too (so much so that I bought the soundtrack), sure they might not do as good a job as the original artist in the 80s, and even sing the songs differently such as the way Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) sang Dead or Alive as a duet with Sherrie (Julianne Hough).  But I like that sort of thing, if you want it exactly the same you might as well just play the original artists and have them lip sync over that.<br /><br />I must admit I was hesitant that Tom Cruise could one pass as young enough to be an 80s lead singer in a rock band, but he does pull the look of an almost washed up rock star well.  I also had concerns if he and others such as Baldwin, Brand and Jones could sing at all let alone good enough to do the classic songs of Guns N Roses, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and others that I was a favourite of well.  But he/they all do a great job, as I said good enough that I bought the soundtrack. I mean on the DVD you have a special feature called Def Leppard: Live At The Premiere which is basically that band playing Pour Some Sugar on Me on the red carpet.  Cruise had way more enthusiasm than the ageing Joe Elliot with the intro Hugh! line to the song in fact the whole song was done better. Granted Def Leppard aren't in their prime anymore (and I was a big fan of these guys) but I think critics of Cruise's performance should watch Jaxx's performance of Pour Some Sugar on me back to back with the DVD extra before passing judgement.<br /><br />I had never heard of Julianne Hough or Diego Boneta who are the two main characters the plot revolves around but both did a great job in both singing and acting.  Julianne being smoking hot, as was the reporter and some characters didn't harm the whole enjoyment of watching factor either.<br /><br />Visit Florida tourism commercial was a bit out of place as an extra, would have preferred to see something else on the DVD but I guess maybe they sponsored or were in investor in the film or something.<br /><br />But definitely get this DVD, it's a lot of fun and a nice nostalgic trip for the two hours or so duration!ger in a rock band, but he does pull the look of an almost washed up rock star well.

B007MDB548|5.0|Whenever I review a Tinker Bell, I'm always amazed how each film gets better and better in overall animation and storytelling.  With the release of \\"Secret of the wings\\", this animated family film is touching, fun and and highly entertaining!<br /><br />Who is Tinker Bell?<br /><br />Tinker Bell, a fictional character that was developed back in 1904 by J.M. Barrie and later on in 1911 in the novel \\"Peter and Wendy\\" is best known for her appearance in the 1953 Walt Disney film \\"Peter Pan\\". The character is quite iconic for Disney, as she is quite literally the unofficial mascot for the Walt Disney Company and can be seen in many of their commercials and in 2008, the character received her first animated film which was direct-to-DVD and Blu-ray.<br /><br />After the success of the first \\"Tinker Bell\\" film in 2008, the whole gang returned for the second film titled \\"Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure\\" in 2009,  and in 2010, Tinker Bell returned once more in \\"Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue\\".  Now, the fourth film in the series is titled \\"Secret of the Wings\\" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD but also a Flitterific Fairies Double Pack which includes the Blu-ray+DVD+Digital Copy and a Blu-ray 3D.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Secret of the Wings\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1). First let me discuss the animation for this film and the Blu-ray version.  With each Tinker Bell-related film, I have talked about how each film gets better and better when it comes to the computer animation and overall rendering of the models and scenery.  There is more detail with each film and once again, \\"Secret of the Wings\\" looks vibrant and well-detailed with its colorful presentation.  On Blu-ray, the film is absolutely vibrant, sharp and the details are noticeable in HD.<br /><br />And I can continue to list so many positives from the plants, the clothing, the accessories and the beautiful backgrounds, the lush green grass, the water and ice effects, the trees and even the animals are well detailed with their hair effects. Also, the special effects via CG from the lighting effects utilizing the pixie dust and then my favorite, the animated facial expressions, is just definitely great to look at. Although not a big budget theatrical film, \\"Secret of the Wings\\" looks absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />But the biggest positive of \\"Secret of the Wings\\" is that the film was created with 3D in mind.  With the opening introduction of the film, you are greeted with objects that are coming right at you and immediately, you get to see how depth comes to play for this film.<br /><br />From birds or fairies flying towards you, the film also adds depth to show height to various areas of the village that seem as if they are standing apart.  The 3D for this film looks great and it really helps that the film was created with 3D in mind, as opposed to other Disney films that are more 3D depth-based and were not originally created in 3D.<br /><br />AUDIO:<br /><br />As for audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  While the film is crystal clear when it comes to the dialogue and music, there are some moments that do utilize the surround channels and effectively uses ambiance to bring the film to life.  While not as immersive as I would have liked, the lossless audio for \\"Secret of the Wings\\" is still crisp and clear that families will find overall audio to be pleasing.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack \\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Pixie Hollow Games Bonus Adventure - (22:34) In this short animated feature with the Disney Fairies, the fairies of Pixie Hollow take part in a Pixie Hollow Games competition.  But can anyone defeat the nine-consecutive Pixie Hollow Games champions, the Storm Fairies?<br />  \\"Great Divide\\" Music Video performedby the McClain Sisters - (3:03)<br />  \\"Dig Down Deeper\\" Music Video performed by Zendaya (from Pixie Hollow Games) - (3:08)<br />  Pixie Preview\\" Fright Light - (1:02) A short animated feature about a mouse being chased by a rat.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack\\" comes with a special lenticular slip cover case (different from the graphic that you see above plus a Blu-ray, DVD, Digital Copy and a Blu-ray 3D version of the film.  The DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 - Enhanced for 16×9 televisions.  Subtitles are in Englsh SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Secret of the Wings\\" is possibly the most touching Tinker Bell film I have seen thus far!  It's one thing to see Tinker Bell go on adventures and seeing her curiosity always leading her to good things but also bad things if she isn't careful.  The film does have important lessons for children, but the overall story makes for a very entertaining and touching family film.<br /><br />It's an interesting storyline because we are introduced to Tinker Bell's sister, Periwinkle.  And it's rather touching and even emotional because they come from different lands that fairies from both Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods are to never cross to each other's lands.  And for these two sisters who just met with each other, to be forbidden to each other is sad.<br /><br />But of course, this is a Tinker Bell film and she always tries to find a way.<br /><br />But possibly the most memorable scenes are when both try to enjoy each other's company by experiencing the fun and enjoyable things of their two lands.  What beauty can the ice bring?  And of course with Tinker Bell's home, the beauty of flowers, water and butterflies flying in the air.  But when Periwinkle collapses because of the lack of cold weather and ice in Pixie Hollow, it becomes a battle of time to get her to safety before she loses her wings.  And another major trouble hits both lands as the seasons change due to an accident.  And the lives of fairies of both lands become threatened.<br /><br />But as always, Tinker Bell always finds a way to get things fixed!<br /><br />\\"Secret of the Wings\\" will attract younger and older audiences with its friendly screenplay and beautiful animation and music. It's also a film that is very accessible for boys or girls because the cast of characters feature guys and girls as fairies.<br /><br />As for the voice acting, \\"Secret of the Wings\\" uses major talent for this fourth film and the voice acting was fantastic!  You have Timothy Dalton (\\"James Bond\\" films: \\"License to Kill\\", \\"The Living Daylights\\", \\"The Tourist\\") providing the voice of Lord Milori, Anjelica Huston (\\"The Addams Family\\", \\"50/50″, \\"The Royal Tennebaums\\") as Queen Clarion, Megan Hilty (\\"Smash\\", \\"The Maiden and the Princess\\") as Rosetta, Lucy Liu (\\"Charlie's Angels\\", \\"Kill Bill\\") as Silver Mist and Lucy Hale (\\"Pretty Little Liars\\", \\"Privileged\\") as Periwinkle.  And pretty much, all the voice talent from the three previous Tinker Bells films are back!  Including Mae Whitman as Tinker Bell, Raven-Symone as Iridessa and Jesse McCartney as Terence, to name a few.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack\\" is outstanding.  The film was created with 3D in mind and this film delivers when it comes to objects or animals coming right at you and also to show great amount of depth as the Fairies and birds fly around Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods.  And as the Blu-ray 3D is effective, the regular Blu-ray looks absolutely gorgeous.  Once again, the animation impressed me with its vibrant colors, sharpness and detail.  You can see the characters blushing, you can see the detail on the flowers to the trees.  Water and ice effects look fantastic!  If anything, I know I gushed about the third film back  in 2010, but \\"Secret of the Wings\\" for 2012 looks even more impressive!  And  the fact you get four versions ofthe film (Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Download) is a plus!<br /><br />And for special features, you get two videos, a very short Pixie Preview of \\"Fright Light\\" but you also get a 22-minute bonus animated adventure of \\"Pixie Hollow Games\\" featuring Tinker Bell and friends competing in various athletic games.<br /><br />As for parents who are wondering if this film is scary at all, there really are no scary parts in this film. It's pretty safe!  But of course as parents, you just want to remind the children that there are rules that grownups make, in order to protect people from getting hurt.  And that is a message that is continually driven throughout the film.  But also the importance of love and teamwork.<br /><br />Another magnificent animated film featuring one of Disney's most recognized iconic characters, \\"Secret of the Wings' is a touching fantasy/adventure animated family film at its best and a perfect film for the entire family. A film created with 3D in mind, \\"Secret of the Wings: Flitterific Fairies Double Pack\\" is perfect for those who want to experience the film in 3D, in HD on Blu-ray, DVD or via Digital Copy.

B005S9EJ14|5.0|Delightfully charming. A lot of faces I recognized, too. Excellent acting, good story line and I good finish. Over all a good time spent.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Some of the best fantasy books ever written! Could not stop reading. Hoping that it won't take as long for the next book in the series.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This whole trilogy was a complete waste of time and money. It was a very boring and predictable book (matter of fact, the characters were the same way), and I felt like the author really needed a thesaurus because she kept using the same phrases time and again. All three of the books are redundant. If you actually get through reading the first one and don't die from the tedious storyline, you'll already know exactly what the second two are like.
B00138J6VM|5.0|If you are an Aerosmith fan, this is a must for you to have in your collection. Classic Rock at it's finest.Possibly the group's greatest work.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the mitch rapp series and in order, it is good to get back to real time in the life of rapp. Some of these books are a little off the top, but this one brings back the stuff you want to read about rapp. I am not finished yet at about 75% on kindle fire, to this point it has some twist to the story which keeps it interesting. If your a rapp fan, you will enjoy this book.
B005LAII08|5.0|In the summer of 2012, Pixar Animation Studios released their latest computer-animated film titled \\"Brave\\".<br /><br />The summer blockbuster was written by award-winning writer Brenda Chapman (\\"Chicken Run\\", \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", \\"The Real Ghostbusters\\"), Mark Andrews (\\"John Carter\\", \\"Spider-Man\\"), Steve Purcell (creator of the adventure game series \\"Sam & Max\\") and Irene Mecchi (\\"The Lion King\\", \\"Hercules\\", \\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\") and co-directed by Mark Andrews, Brenda Chapman and Steve Purcell.<br /><br />The film would become Pixar's first fairy tale film and also feature a darker tone compared to previous Pixar animated films.  And as one would expected from a Pixar film, \\"Brave\\" which was budgeted around $185 million, went on to earn over $532 million in the box office.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is probably one of the most significant Disney/Pixar animated releases I have seen in terms of overall presentation and gorgeous picture quality.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:39:1) aspect ratio and as far as picture quality is concerned, everything about this film looks incredibly well-detailed.<br /><br />First, let's take a look at the Blu-ray 3D version.  For those who have the hardware to display 3D, this is one film that was created with 3D in mind.  From the way the animation utilizes depth for 3D is wonderful to see.  You actually can see the scale of the castle through 3D as it gives an impression the location is quite vast.  While there are scenes with the Elinor as the bear or Mor'du the demon bear cowering over a character with great monstrosity, you can see the scale of the bears.<br /><br />But for the most part, the 3D for this film is improved compared to past Disney 3D films.  Overall, depth gives us a sense of scale much more effective for the film on Blu-ray 3D.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, the Blu-ray of \\"Brave\\" is fantastic.<br /><br />From the food that King Fergus is eating to the emphasis on hair, from the strands of hair, unkept hair, beard hair, ear hair, you name it, there is a lot of detail when it comes to hair and hair physics in this film.  Also, the clothing are well=-detailed, the background scenery looks magnificent outdoors especially indoors.  The overall color is sharp, vibrant and black levels are nice and deep.<br /><br />There are so many things about this film that looks realistic and detailed, I was really impressed.  The overall picture quality is one of the best I have seen on Blu-ray and the film on Blu-ray looks amazing!<br /><br />As for the DVD, the DVD version is presented in 2:39:1, enhanced for 16×9 televisions.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />If you thought that \\"Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" was great for videophiles, audiophiles will also find a lot of satisfaction with the Blu-ray release.  Presented in Dolby TrueHD 7.1, this is one of the most immersive Disney Blu-ray releases I have heard for an animated film.  From the environmental ambiance of hearing the forest, the wind, the trees, the grass being fully integrated to the film and giving you the sense that Merida and family are out in the country, there is also great utilization of sound when Mor'Du approaches or when Ilinor growls in bear form.  There is also great utilization of sound when Merida is shooting her bow and arrow or when the men are fighting against the demon bear.<br /><br />The immersive soundtrack utilizes the surround channels may it be with sound effects or its beautiful musical soundtrack but also a good amount of LFE to make you feel those action scenes.  But the positive factor of this film is its immersiveness and making you feel that sound outdoors are coming from all over your soundscape.  \\"Brave\\" sounds absolutely fantastic in Blu-ray!<br /><br />As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English SDH, English Commentary 2.0 Dolby Digital, Spanish<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Brave:Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  La Luna - (6:57) A theatrical short about a young boy working with his father and grandfather.<br />  The Legend of Mor'Du - (6:51) What is the history about the demon bear known as Mor'Du.<br />  Behind the Scenes - (12:35) Featuring seven scenes in which the crew traveled to Scotland and embraced the scenery which was important for creating the look and feel of \\"Brave\\".<br />  Once Upon a Time - (7:47) Each scene may have had different perspectives and storytelling that had to be cut out.

But obviously it was a film that was used to test waters of what Pixar can accomplish outside of animated films that featured non-human characters, especially characters who were not young children and it was also a film that featured Pixar Animation Studios first female director.<br /><br />While a film like \\"Up\\" was a film about an elderly man's life who is changed thanks to a child, \\"Brave\\" is a film that was driven by co-director and co-writer Brenda Chapman and capturing the relationship between mother and daughter.  From Chapman's experience of traveling to Scotland and wanting to create a fairy tale in the tradition of Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm.<br /><br />I'm always open for something unique and different and what I enjoyed about this film is it's overall feel and how the film incorporated Scottish dialects and utilizing the right talent that fit the film.  Originally, Reese Witherspoon was to voice the character of Merida, but it worked to Pixar's benefit to have actress Kelly Macdonald play the lead character.  From the spoken dialogue to seeing a female character that is athletic, dominant but also free-spirited, you just don't see this kind of character in a Disney animated film.<br /><br />And speaking of acting, along with actress Kelly Macdonald, \\"Brave\\" also features wonderful voice acting from Bill Connolly, Emma Thompson, Julie Walters, Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd and Craig Ferguson.  The voice acting really made a big difference in the believability of this film.<br /><br />And it's important to mention that \\"Brave\\" is not a film that loses its cuteness in sake of creating something realistic.  While the film does focus on mother and daughter relationships, children will no doubt love the adorable and mischievous nature of Merida's triplet young brothers.  And also, for action purposes, you have Merida's father ready to jump into any fray to defend his family and people.<br /><br />The characters are fun, the scenery looks absolutely beautiful and overall animation is fantastic.  But will it work for children?  I think children will love it for its action.  I also feel that families will enjoy it for that family bonding storyline but also the nature of the story and the aspect of family.<br /><br />And for those who have wanted an animated film with a brave heroine, \\"Brave\\" is that kind of movie.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, \\"Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is wonderful!  Not only is this the best 3D animated film to come from Disney thus far, it's also a film that looks and sounds incredible on Blu-ray.  There is so much detail in the characters (especially the hair!) , clothing, backgrounds and scenery, I was impressed by seeing how fantastic \\"Brave\\" looks on Blu-ray.  It really was breathtaking just to watch this film and see how Pixar continues to improve after one hit film after the other.  As for special features, you get a lot of them included with this release that shows us how much work and research went into capturing Scottish culture and integrating it through the entire film.<br /><br />And with the holiday season coming up, \\"Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is also fantastic as you get the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and digital copy.<br /><br />A first for Pixar....first female director, the first fairy tale film and a film that focuses on a mother and daughter relationship.  But \\"Brave\\" is much more than that!  It's a film that is strong on storytelling, featuring wonderful acting but also, \\"Brave\\" is one of the most impressive Blu-ray releases I have ever seen and heard in my years of reviewing Blu-ray releases.<br /><br />\\"Brave: Ultimate Collector's Edition\\" is a must-own, must-buy Blu-ray release!

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Read the first three pages then try to put the book down.  I dare you!  This is a terrific sci fi story about a future totally unlike any you have imagined.  It's also a terrific adventure story with a group of lovable oddball characters.  I loved it.
B009LL4LMM|4.0|I just successfully killed 5 hours at work today getting all water drops on every level. Good for an afternoon of fun or to kill some time.
B009A882D0|5.0|All the songs and all the covers in one place - nice nostalgia trip! John Fogarty and his brother at their best.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Loved reading the original story after years of watching the various Hollywood interpretations. Good read for sitting around the Christmas Tree.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Attractive watch with a sturdy band. Must beg worn daily to keep wound - even with that, the watch consistently loses about 2 - 3 minutes per week - this was my only disappointment.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|It's a month of \\"Resident Evil\\" as the live action film \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" was just released in theaters nationwide and the video game \\"Resident Evil 6″ is slated for release on October 2, 2012.  So, why not add another CG film to the mix with the release of \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\", the second full-length motion capture CG animation feature based on CAPCOM's \\"Resident Evil\\" game series.<br /><br />While the film will be released in theaters in Japan in October 2012, the Blu-ray and DVD was released on Sept. 25, 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  And the first thing you will notice is how much more detailed the CG animation is with \\"Damnation\\" compared to the \\"Resident Evil: Degeneration\\" released back in 2008.  The motion capture is fantastic as the expressions and mannerisms of a character is well-captured.  But the detail of facial characteristics on Leon S. Kennedy's, Ada Wong and the President's face is remarkable.  There is a lot of detail that can be seen with the characters, as well as the monstrous beasts.  Overall, the CG for \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" looks fantastic in HD!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is presented in English, French and Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish, Thai 5.1 Dolby Digital.  For an action-intense film such as \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\", I was expecting an immersive soundtrack.  While the dialogue and sound effects did sound good, coming from the front channel, I was hoping to hear more LFE and the surround channels.  To have a more immersive soundtrack, because there is so much action.  The lossless soundtrack is good but I was expecting much more ambiance, good directional use of bullets being shot and explosions to be much more immersive.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Conceptual Art Gallery - Using your remote, you can cycle through the various art throughout the film. (a Blu-ray exclusive)<br />  Las Plagas: Organisms of War  - (6:59) A short feature about the parasites that can be used for biological warfare.<br />  The DNA of Damnation -  (30:05) Interviews with the Japanese creators of \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\".<br />  Gag Reel - (6:03) English voice dub outtakes.<br />  Resident Evil 6 Trailer - (3:54) The video game trailer for \\"Resident Evil 6″.<br />  Devil May Cry Trailer - (2:14) The video game trailer for the upcoming \\"Devil May Cry\\" game.<br />  Dragon's Dogma Trailer - (2:06) The video game trailer for Dragon's Dogma.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" comes with a UltraViolet redemption code.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Since the release of the first \\"Resident Evil\\" game for the Sony Playstation back in 1996, I have been a fan of the series purchasing the many games that have been released on various consoles, portable consoles and have also enjoyed the live-action films, despite the differences with the video game series.  As well, as enjoying the first CG film, \\"Resident Evil: Degeneration\\".<br /><br />With the release of \\"Resident Evil: Redemption\\" in theaters and the exciting trailer for \\"Resident Evil 6″ having been unveiled this past summer and wowing video gamers for its incredible detail and amount of characters being featured, when I found out that \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" was coming out, I was happy because it featured the reunion of Leon and Ada, two characters who were fantastic together in the hit video game \\"Resident Evil 4″.<br /><br />Watching \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" and seeing these two characters once again, I'm a little torn of how I feel for the CG animated film.  In one sense, I felt the CG animation, the motion capture effects and the detail of Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong in this film were fantastic.<br /><br />In fact, there are times where I felt this film was more \\"visual eye-candy\\" as it not only showcased the sexiness of Ada Wong's character but also showing us why she is an exciting character that can kick a lot of butt but also why she is also a dangerous character that can't be trusted.<br /><br />And of course, Leon is the ultimate hero but also becoming more of an unstoppable character in the \\"Resident Evil\\" series.  Awesome with weaponry, great at fighting and both he and Ada were popular characters that no doubt were showcased because people want to see more of them.<br /><br />In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if some of the details featured in \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" have some tie-in with \\"Resident Evil 6″ and seen with the trailer, Leon and possibly Ada have an important role in the upcoming game and it looks as if Leon is the protagonist once again.<br /><br />So, while CG animation and the action sequences were magnificent, the storyline was not as OK.  If anything, this CG animated film is pretty much a popcorn action film to showcase both Leon and Ada kicking butt.  Nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />I don' t think there was anything related to the story that captured my attention.  If anything, those moments to see Ada taking on the president in hand-to-hand combat was impressive, seeing Leon taking on these hulking monolith army was reminiscent of the older \\"Terminator\\" films.  And that is what impressed me the most about this film.  Primarily the action sequences, rather than the storyline which was forgettable and if it was to be important, the writing surely didn't make us care at all.<br /><br />The Blu-ray release showcases the amazing CG animation of this film.  Details on HD are impressive, especially the closeups.  The lossless soundtrack was not as great as I was hoping.  I was hoping for more immersiveness, because this film featured so much action.  But while dialogue and action were crystal clear from the front channels, I was hoping more noticeable uses of the surround and rear surround channels and LFE.  There are a few special features that were included and it was cool to hear from the Japanese creators of the challenges that went into making this film.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" will excite \\"Resident Evil\\" fans who loved seeing Leon and Ada kick butt in \\"Resident Evil 4″.  The two are reunited again and it's their action sequences that will no less excite fans who are eagerly awaiting the video game release of \\"Resident Evil 6″.  This is the best I have seen of Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong and I'm sure fans will appreciate that.  But as far as the story is concerned, those who have never played the \\"Resident Evil\\" games can easily watch this film without knowing the background of the video game series or knowledge of its characters.<br /><br />Exciting, action-packed and featuring fantastic CG animation and use of motion capture, \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is a popcorn action film that focuses a little too much on the action, while the storyline feels as if it is not important nor does it have any affect on the actual video game series storyline involving Umbrella.  But if you are a \\"Resident Evil 4″ fan and want to see Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong together again, then \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is for you!as more \\"visual eye-candy\\" as it not only showcased the sexiness of Ada Wong's character but also showing us why she is an exciting character that can kick a lot of butt but also why she is also a dangerous character that can't be trusted.<br /><br />And of course, Leon is the ultimate hero but also becoming more of an unstoppable character in the \\"Resident Evil\\" series.

B008BWFOVE|4.0|From Polish filmmaker/screenwriter Malgorzata Szumowska (\\"Stranger\\", \\"Happy Man\\") and co-writer Tine Byrckel comes a film about self-reflection in \\"Elles\\".<br /><br />Starring actress Juliette Binoche (\\"The English Patient\\", \\"Three Colors: Blue\\", \\"Cache\\") and young talents Anais Demoustier (\\"Therese Desqueyroux\\", \\"Last Winter\\") and Joanna Kulig (\\"The Woman in the Fifth\\"), \\"Elles\\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Kino Lorber.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Elles\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 anamorphic widescreen).  While watching this film, there was something beautiful about the Michael Englert's cinematography.  From scenes showcasing the women outside of their patio and you can see the buildings and scenery around them, for me it was the juxtaposition of beautiful images through Anne's home.  From her cooking food to wearing her silk pajamas, there was this look of beauty that was captured on camera.  Almost heavenly to describe the living conditions of Anne, vs. the more grimy nature of her going to some location where graffiti is spraypainted on walls and she can't bare the thought of using the bathroom in that facility.  But as beauty is captured in Anne's home, there's also a beautiful capturing of sex scenes that involve Charlotte.  They are subtle sex scenes but the way they were filmed was beautiful.  Composition was fantastic!<br /><br />I didn't detect any problems during my viewing of this film on Blu-ray but overall, a solid presentation.<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Elles\\" is presented in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with English subtitles.  The film is primarily front channel driven, dialogue was crystal clear and the music from the classical music channel also sounds great coming from the front channel.  There is good utilization of music from classical music to Swedish electro-pop.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"elles\\" comes with the following special feature:<br /><br />  Edited and Unedited Trailers - Featuring the original theatrical trailer (1:52) and the red band trailer (1:55)<br />  Stills Gallery - Featuring seven stills from the film.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />\\"Elles\\" is a fascinating film as it tries to show us another approach to why people take part in prostitution.  It is known that there are women putting themselves through college through erotic dancing and sex, but what makes \\"Elles\\" so different is that these women are not complaining about the work that they do or the men they have sex with.  They are mostly negative about the living conditions that they once came from.<br /><br />While Anne tries to probe into why the young women do what they do, there is no remorse for having sex with married men.  It's through these men that these young women feel they are in control, it is their freedom to do as they wish and if they want to make money through prostitution, then so be it.<br /><br />Charlotte and Alicja are just happy to have the money to live the way that they want. And while Anne is surprised by this, she finds herself wanting to be with them, interviewing them but also putting herself in their shoes of how life would be to live like them and be independent, sexually free and just enjoying life like the two young women are.  Meanwhile, these two women look at Anne and are envious because she is a person with status and living a life that they want.<br /><br />Charlotte tries to explain to Anne that she has no problems having sex with men but her past life of living poor is much worse than what she does to make a living.  She will never return to that life of being poor and for Charlotte, her questions for Anne is if she has a window in her bathroom.  Taking Anne by surprise, she starts to realize that these young women dream of having things that she never really took notice of.<br /><br />So, it's this journey of watching how Anne transforms herself from being a woman and journalist under deadline, always stressed out but seeing that these young women living a life of independent freedom, she admires that.  While her husband criticizes her to not talk about feminism during a dinner with his clients.<br /><br />Part of the efficacy of this film lies in the performance of Juliette Binoche.  Not only is she able to portray the role of Anne as natural but she is also an actress that can take small nuances and play with it and make us feel comfortable and that her character is natural.  One scene features the character of Anne eating with Alicja and Binoche just shows us a woman having fun, trying to chew but always laughing because she is drunk.  It's such a natural way of acting this scene out and goes to show how much of a talented, veteran actress she truly is.<br /><br />The other part of the film's efficacy is the cinematography by Michal Englert.  The film looks absolutely beautiful because of his composition and on Blu-ray, the film looks great. The scenes of Anne working at home and trying to tidy up to the sexual scenes of the film, the way it's presented in film looks great!<br /><br />I may need to warn people that this film does include many sexual scenes.  I know that there are people who complained about the use of sex in the film.  Personally, I thought it was integral to the film, which was showing how these women have no problem doing requests for these married men.  These men are not able to have their wives enact their fantasies, but these two women will make their fantasies come true.  I will say that I don't think I have ever seen a golden shower scene in a film before, so suffice to say, the film really goes out to show how far these two young women will go in their sexual exploits.<br /><br />But as far as the Blu-ray is concerned,  picture quality for the Blu-ray was very good, lossless audio was crystal clear and as for special features, there isn't really much included with the Blu-ray but trailers and a stills gallery.<br /><br />Sensual, natural and entertaining!  Overall, \\"Elles\\" is a film about life and self-discovery. It's also a film featuring a magnificent, realistic performance by actress Juliette Binoche.  And while it may not be the best film to star Juliette Binoche, it's definitely one of her best performances seen in a film!r deadline, always stressed out but seeing that these young women living a life of independent freedom, she admires that.

B000GBEWHA|5.0|First time I have ever watched this movie and it was awesome. I have always been a fan of musicals and romance movies.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|This movie sucked big time.Yes it was bloody and gory.But it was not scary or a movie that sticks with you.It was just disgusting without a point.Save your money!
B008HK3XU4|1.0|I ordered this at the same time I ordered my Kindle.  When they arrived I quickly tried to put the Kindle in the case.  The directions say it should snap in securely.  There is no securely to it.  The remaining gap in the case was about 1/2 inch along one side.  I thought I had ordered wrong.  I got out my packing slips for both products, but they both said 7 inch Kindle.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'll be returning the case.

B008Y1YKE4|4.0|In November  2011, the British/American 3D animated film \\"Arthur Christmas\\" was released in theaters.<br /><br />Produced by Aardman Animations and Sony Pictures Animation, the film was co-directed by Sarah Smith (\\"The Pirates! Band of Misfits\\", The League of Gentlemen\\", \\"The Awful Truth\\") and Bary Cook (director of \\"Mulan\\" and known for visual effects for Disney films such as \\"Aladdin\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"The Rescuers Down Under\\", \\"Tron\\") and a screenplay co-written by Smith and Peter Baynham (\\"Borat\\", \\"Bruno\\", \\"Hotel Transylvania\\").<br /><br />The animated film would feature voice talent from stars such as as James McAvoy (\\"X-Men: First Class\\", \\"Wanted\\", \\"The Last King of Scotland\\"), Hugh Laurie (\\"House, M.D.\\", \\"Stuart Little\\", \\"Monsters vs. Aliens\\"), Bill Nighy (\\"Love Actually\\", \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1″, \\"Hot Fuzz\\"), Jim Broadbent (\\"Moulin Rouge!\\", \\"Gangs of New York\\", \\"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\"), Imelda Staunton (\\"Vera Drake\\", \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", \\"Chicken Run\\"), Ashley Jensen (\\"Ugly Betty\\", \\"Gnomeo & Juliet\\", \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\"), Marc Wooton (\\"Frequently Asked Questions  About Time Travel\\", \\"Cyberdelic\\"), Laura Linney (\\"The Truman Show\\", \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Primal Fear\\"), Eva Longoria (\\"Desperate Housewives\\", \\"The Sentinel\\"), Joan Cusack (\\"Working Girl\\", \\"Say Anything\\", \\"Toy Story 2 & 3″), Michael Palin (\\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\", \\"Life of Brian\\", \\"The Meaning of Life\\") and many more.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Arthur's Christmas\\" is presented in 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen.  \\"Arthur's Christmas\\" is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital plus an English - Audio Description Track.<br /><br />If you want the best audio quality, I recommend the Blu-ray release.<br /><br />But overall, the CG animation for \\"Arthur Christmas\\" by Aardman Animations is pretty much the best animated film that I have seen from the studio.  Textures are well-detailed, everything from the characters to background scenery is amazingly well-detailed and well-animated.  If anything, I had a feeling that this film would look even more incredible on Blu-ray.<br /><br />And as for the audio quality for \\"Arthur Christmas\\" is well-done as there are quite a number of action-paced segments that utilize the surround channels effectively.  But if you are an audiophile, definitely go lossless as the Blu-ray release of \\"Arthur Christmas\\" will have a much better and possibly immersive soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Arthur's Christmas\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Un-wrapping Arthur Christmas - (13:27) Featuring interviews with the cast and crew of \\"Arthur Christmas\\".<br />  Progression Reels - (13:49) Featuring animators commentary and for the featured progression reels for \\"Arthur Christmas Unwrapped\\", \\"Arthur's Office\\", \\"Grandsanta\\", \\"Invasion\\", \\"Trelew\\".<br />  Elf Recruitment Video - (1:11) An animated video for elf recruitment (and a promotional for \\"Arthur Christmas\\").<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Arthur Christmas\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows you to download the film to your computer or select Apple and Android devices and also stream to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to animated films with a Christmas theme, a lot of films that tend to feature Santa often become banal.  Rehashed storylines with predictable endings.  But for Aardman Animations, they wanted to do something different when it comes to an animated Christmas film.<br /><br />Many children often ask how Santa is able to deliver so many presents to people all around the world and what writers Peter Baynham and Sarah Smith did was to answer just that.<br /><br />Unlike other Santa-related films, \\"Arthur Christmas\\" shows us that there is a line of Claus' members from grandsanta that people are familiar with, when it comes to the sleigh and reindeer.  But now a new generation of Claus that use modern technology that allows them to cover a large area of the world with speed and efficiency.  And how the elves have a big part to play in the wrapping and delivery of the items to various homes.<br /><br />But what if technology goes awry?  In this case, technology doesn't account for one single present and that means a child will be missing out on her Christmas gift?<br /><br />It's a pretty interesting concept to deal with different means of delivering children's presents to various people and how technology comes into play for a modern Christmas storyline.<br /><br />And because of its story, it's an accessible Christmas animated film for both children and adults.  Children will no doubt love watching clumsy Arthur or even the adorable Elves, while adults will understand the concept of Santa retiring, Mrs. Claus wanting her husband to be home and literally pass the torch to their children and of course, Santa having a hard time facing reality that it is probably time to let his children become the next Santa, while he starts his new life becoming more of a husband.<br /><br />It's no doubt a modern tale, mixed in with the classic \\"will Santa be able to deliver the presents in time\\" storyline.<br /><br />The animation from Aardman Animation and Sony Pictures animation was magnificent.  This is probably the best CG animated film to focus on Christmas and as the animation and the artwork for this film is very detailed and well-done, the voice acting with its talented cast also should be commended but having this British/American collaboration worked very well and was impressed by how things were executed in terms of animation, storyline, voice acting and direction.  I was impressed!<br /><br />As for the DVD, picture and audio quality on DVD is very good, but if you are an audio or videophile, I recommend the Blu-ray release of \\"Arthur Christmas\\".  The DVD also comes with a few special features and for the most part, \\"Arthur Christmas\\" is a solid holiday release!<br /><br />Overall, \\"Arthur Christmas\\" is an animated film that parents will no doubt want to buy for the children to watch over Christmas vacation.<br /><br />It does have a PG-rating mainly for mild rude humor but for the most part, there is nothing terrible, nothing violent that will frighten children.  Granted, there is a scene where Arthur, Grandsanta and Bryony accidentally land in the African jungle and are chased by animals of the wild and there are times where Arthur tends to get himself in a wee bit of trouble (ie. trying to fly with the reindeer) or one scene (which is probably the rude scene of the film), when Steve accidentally delivers a toy to the wrong child and tries to take it back from the child.  This is probably the extend of anything that an be seen as frightening for very young children.  But outside of that, \\"Arthur Christmas\\" is the perfect Christmas animated film being released on Blu-ray or DVD for the family this year!<br /><br />\\"Arthur Christmas\\" is a fun, adventurous and enjoyable Christmas animated film for the entire family!

0545265355|5.0|I started reading the 1st book and my 13 year old daughter swiped it and read it in just a couple of days.  This was the 1st book that she couldn't put down and she read it in a couple of days....same with the next two.  The books are so much better than the movie.  I highly recommend them.
B000UX6THK|5.0|This collection was everything I expected.  I got it as a gift for my wife who loved the series and now she can view it anytime she wants.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|ok it gets hard and sometimes u tat stuck one a level fir multiple days but its super fun and challenging
B001EN71CW|5.0|The Blu-ray itself plays well, and we have had no issues with it.  As for the series, we love it.  It's a quirky space western that combines the best parts of sci-fi with some great elements of old westerns.  The story is engaging, funny, and exciting.  I would recommend Firefly to people who like sci-fi standards like Star Trek.  This series will keep you interested and laughing with the banter that occurs between characters.  The banter is somewhat reminiscent of the the Whedon classic Buffy.  Overall, a really fun series to watch.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|First off- I never write reviews....not sure why, I just dont<br />I can't help but write about this album. I LOVE xtina in every way-and have hated the so called bad reviews of this and that about her over the past few yrs...seriously gimme a break, this girl is the real deal.<br />She lives life fully, with no shame, is a good person and one of the BEST artists ever in music. She can SING better than anyone, can dance, is beautiful and is an amazingly GOOD person.<br />This album shows ALL of that. Literally there is not ONE track that is not great....<br />Her voice transends..the lyrics are heartfelt and some super fun...and the beats can't get better<br />The ballets will make anyone have a good cry<br />This album has been playing on my stereo non stop, because right now it is exactly what I needed.<br />I can only imagine there are probably tons of people out there and are in a spot in there life that need a great album like this to lift them up<br />It does that- go get it, give it out as gifts and rock out...<br />thanks Xtina, I love you....we all do and like you already know being who you really are is all that counts in life.<br />long live pop music baby
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Back in 1962, filmmaker David Lean (known for directing films such as \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", \\"Doctor Zhivago\\", \\"A Passage to India\\", \\"Great Expectations\\", \\"Oliver Twist\\" and \\"Brief Encounter\\"), Lean would go on to direct a film that would be considered as \\"one of the greatest and most influential films\\" in the history of cinema according to film institutes and cinema poll.<br /><br />With the success of \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", both producer Sam Spiegel and David Lean decided to take on a film that would be based on the life of T.E. Lawrence.  The film is based on the writings of T.E. Lawrence and a screenplay was created by Robert Bolt (\\"A Man for All Seasons\\", \\"Doctor Zhivago\\") and Michael Wilson (\\"Planet of hte Apes\\", \\"5 Fingers\\", \\"The Sandpiper\\").<br /><br />Lawrence, who was an officer of the British Army was sent to the Middle East  in order to create an internal insurgency against the Ottoman Empire and is best known for convincing Arab leaders (Faisal and Abdullah) to support the British strategy and lead an assault on the Ottoman stronghold in Medina.  And lead to even more success in supporting Lawrence's dream of an independent Arabia.<br /><br />Throughout his life, Lawrence was a prolific writer's whose work including his most famous novel \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" was published and made famous in England.<br /><br />Posthumously, the officer has been honored and was featured on the list of BBC's \\"100 Greatest Gritons\\" poll.  T.E. Lawrence has been honored with a memorial plaque in Oxford Boys' High School, his Brough Superior SS100 motorcycle at the Imperial War Museum in London, a bronze bust is featured in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral along with the tombs of Britain's greatest military leaders, plaques are also featured at the homes he grew up as a child.<br /><br />But around the world, the greatest honor for T.E. Lawrence was David Leane's film \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" with the magnificent performance of actor Peter O'Toole as T.E. Lawrence.  Known for its cinematography (shot in Super Panavision 70 courtesy of Freddie Young), its dramatic score by Maurice Jarr and its visual style which influenced filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Martin Scorsese and Sam Peckinpah, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is constantly featured in the top 10 rating of the American Film Institute's \\"Greatest Films\\" and ranked #1 in 2008 for AFI's Top 10 for \\"Epic Film\\".<br /><br />In 1991, the film was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.  With its ten Academy Award nominations, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" would win seven Oscars for \\"Best Picture\\", \\"Best Director\\", \\"Best cinematography\\" and \\"Best Substantially Original Score\\" to name a few.  While in Britain, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" would receive five \\"British Academy Film Awards\\" nominations and would win four including \\"Best Film from Any Source\\", \\"Best British Film\\", \\"Best British Actor\\" and \\"Best British Screenplay\\".<br /><br />While the film has received quite a bit of editing to shorten its duration in the '60s and '70s, a 216-minute restored version was created in 1989 and a restored version (courtesy of Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese) was featured in the 2000 Limited Edition of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" on DVD.  While the film had several re-releases on DVD, a fully restored version of the film was released in 2008.<br /><br />With the 50th Anniversary of the film for 2012, Sony Pictures did a new 8K scan/4K intermediate digital restoration of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and will be released on Blu-ray on November 13th.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />The anticipation has been high for videophiles and cinema fans for the \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" Blu-ray release.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (2:20:1 Anamorphic Widescreen).  Rarely do you get to see films that receive a digital restoration that receives an 8K scan/4K intermediate digital restoration but in order to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", Sony Pictures Home Entertainment definitely went all out.<br /><br />Having owned various video releases of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" in the past, video have been soft, slight flickering of video and DNR was used.<br /><br />And here we are now with the new digital restoration of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and not only does the Blu-ray surpass the DVD in many levels, but the detail can be seen magnificently through this new restoration.  No sign of softness, no sign of DNR, no flickering of video, you ca see the textures in the clothing, the blue in Lawrence's eyes and yes, the use of makeup during that time of the '60s.  But suffice to say, there are no problems in video whatsoever.  The details and the overall look of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is beautiful.  Flesh tones are now natural instead of soft, black levels are nice and deep and the colors really pop when it comes to scenery, especially with Lawrence walking through the desert.<br /><br />Videophiles will no doubt be pleased by this 50th Anniversary Blu-ray release of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and French and Japanese 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Possibly the biggest difference that I personally noticed with the soundtrack is Maurice Jarr's musical score.  The music sounds absolutely fantastic via lossless.<br /><br />But for a film that displays quite a bit of action, from a stampede, to a war which includes quite a bit of machine gun shooting to the opening of the film featuring Lawrence speeding through the road with his motorcycle, the sound effects are much more noticeable through the surround channels.<br /><br />Also, there is quite a bit of ambiance featured throughout the film.  For example, in one scene, as Lawrence and his men hear bombs from the distance or the vehicles driving by, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" similar to its picture quality is absolutely delightful via lossless.  This is the best I have seen and heard of \\"Lawrence  of Arabia\\" and as videophiles would be pleased with the picture quality, audiophiles and cinema fans will be pleased by the lossless audio soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish and Thai.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Secrets of Arabia - A picture-in-graphics track delves onto the real life of T.E. Lawrence.<br />  Peter O'Toole Revisits Lawrence of Arabia - (21:07) Peter O'Toole talks about the people he worked with and the filmking of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br />  Making of Lawrence of Arabia - (1:01:29) The original making of featurette (originally featured in the 2000 limited edition DVD release) of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br />  A Conversation with Steven Spielberg - (8:49) Filmmaker Steven Spielberg talks about his first experience of watching \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" and his love for the film (originally featured in the 2000 limited edition DVD release).<br />  Maan Jordan: The Camels are Cast - (2:00) The casting of the camels used in \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" (originally featured in the 2000 limited edition DVD release).<br />  In Search of Lawrence - (5:00) A featurette that discusses the locations of where the film was shot (originally featured in the 2000 limited edition DVD release).<br />  Romance of Arabia - (4:37) Another featurette that discusses location but the beauty of Arabia and the cities nearby (originally featured in the 2000 limited edition DVD release).<br />  Wind, Sand and Star: The Making of a Classic - (4:32) The original 1970 featurette on the making of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br />  New York Premiere - (1:08) The original news reel footage for NYC premiere of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br />  Advertising campaigns - (4:51) The advertising campaign for \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" comes with a cardboard sleeve case and comes with an UtraViolet code with a redemption code to download the film onto a computer or to Apple and Android devices for streaming to computers, tablets or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to renown epics, David Lean's \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is one of the most amazing films ever created.  From its beautiful cinematography, its impressive and moving musical score and its powerful acting by Peter O'Toole, believe it or not, \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" was a major risk.<br /><br />Sure, David Lean and Sam Spiegel have had their success, especially with \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\" but a film shot in a desert, four hours long, for this film to work, it was going to have to be significant and well-balanced especially telling the story of T.E. Lawrence and why he is so respected in Britain.<br /><br />The storytelling would have go keep viewers captivated but the film rode on the shoulders of main actor Peter O'Toole.  Lawrence was not your typical action hero of the era, nor was he a man of gun ablazing.  He was a different man with a mindset that was meant to be good, honorable no matter how flamboyant of a person that he may be.<br /><br />I have watched this film a number of times, owned it in various formats and even for myself, having watched this film when I was younger until now, I felt at the time that when I first watched this film, he was a man with strong conviction but also a man of mystery.  Whether or not Lawrence was gay or what happened when he was held in prison and tortured, what is important is the journey of seeing this man being put into Cairo to assess one man but instead, ending up creating a revolution.<br /><br />The cinematography by Freddie Young (\\"Doctor Zhivago\\", \\"You Only Live Twice\\", \\"Battle of Britain\\") is vast, beautiful and amazing.  The shots of Lawrence in his robe walking through the desert is breathtaking.  But the music by Maurice Jarr (\\"Ghost\\", \\"Doctor Zhivago\\", \\"Dead Poets Society\\") is equally fantastic as it creates the mood before the film begins, but is rich, emotional and moving.<br /><br />And as costume design, scenery and everything pretty much comes to play in the efficacy of the film, the film is not too cerebral.  It's straight-to-the-point, easily accessible but yet manages to be complex thanks to its two parts, which portray different sides of the Lawrence.<br /><br />But watching this film, no matter how many times throughout my life I have seen it, I am moved, I am amazed and I am impressed by the work that went into the creation of this film.<br /><br />For any cinema fan, you can easily see how this film is a masterpiece by taking a character, that probably is not well-known outside of Britain and craft a story with a unique vision by filmmaker David Lean and given incredible life and once again, adding yet another masterpiece to the filmmakers oeuvre.<br /><br />David Lean is one of the few filmmakers of that era who has been able to make his films appreciated throughout the world because of his grand vision and big ideas that influenced many significant filmmakers today.  And to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of this fantastic film, suffice to say, its a no-brainer that this film is worth owning.<br /><br />Not many films get the 8K scan/4K intermediate digital restoration but it's great to see Sony take this classic film and give it the proper restoration, not only does this Blu-ray release feature the best looking and sounding version of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\", but it features the director's cut which is much longer that the 2000 Limited Edition DVD release (which was only 217 minutes long).  While the special features are the same as featured in the previous Limited Edition DVD release, the Blu-ray does include a new interview with Peter O'Toole plus a \\"Secrets of Arabia Picture-in-Graphics Track\\" (both are Blu-ray exclusives).<br /><br />Before anyone gets rid of their 2000 Limited Edition DVD release, it's important to note that the original DVD had \\"Archives of Arabia: Historic Photographs\\" which is not included on this Blu-ray, as well as the original interactive map and reproduction of the original 1962 souvenir booklet.  So, for collectors, you may want to hold on to that older limited edition DVD release.<br /><br />But it's impressive how far things have come with the release of this film, considering that over 20-years ago, the film could have been lost as the 1989 restoration duo Robert A. Harris and Jim Painten discovered the negatives crushed and in rusted cans.  Also, thanks to filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese for overseeing another restoration of the film and trying to bring the scenes that were cut and edited back together in order to bring back the original long version that moviegoers watched back in 1962.<br /><br />And in 2012, we have the full-length version and the best presentation of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" yet.  This is a magnificent release of the film and while I am aware of the debate by scholars of the historical accuracy of the film, the fact is that the film's screenplay was based on one man's writings and human nature has shown that there is a stretching of truth at times for well-known figures.<br /><br />But the fact is that \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is a unique undertaking and will continue to be seen as one of the grandest epic films created in cinema history.

Every time I comment on Ultra-Violet and how I am unhappy with it, I always get comments from people about how unfair my rating is, and that I should change it.<br /><br />I will continue to rate movies that come without an i-Tunes digital copy, but that come with an ultra-violet copy, with a low rating.  Ultra-violet is a terrible system for digital copies.  Living in a rural part of the country, I don't have access to data speeds that support streaming a movie every single time.  I fly on airplanes and want to watch my movies also.  And I don't want to use my mobile data to stream a movie I already bought.  Ultra-violet is a sham, and I bought one movie to try it with, and will never purchase another.<br /><br />With that being said, this movie is fantastic.  I will purchase the movie from the i-Tunes store and support my purchase with the format I approve of.  And while I would love to have a physical disc to play this movie with, I will not be purchasing the DVD's unless they include an i-Tunes copy.<br /><br />If you look at the ratings on this movie, 90% of the 1 star ratings are based on the ultra-violet copy.  Enough said.  Cya again on the next movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has been outstanding! I have enjoyed every season so far but WOW is Season 3 just leaps and bounds better than the first two. As one of the few that really enjoyed the slow pace of season 2, I am very happy to see that they can do very action heavy episodes and still keep me as interested in the characters lives outside of killing walkers as they did with the slower pace of last season. I also like the introduction of other groups of survivors into the story outside of the ones Rick and the group stumble on during their travels. It shows you just how different people's views can affect how they survive and even down to what they call them (I.E. Walkers/Biters). If you have not watched this season yet or are thinking of getting into the show this is the best time to start! The episodes are only getting better!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I definitely LOVE this movie. I see myself in almost every character. I had those years wondering who I am and who should I become just as Zach did. I had those moments when I was really selfish and blamed everyone around me on my own cowardliness. Now since I'm older I could understand and appreciate better Shaun's patience with his lover. And I believe that is the only way to go.<br /><br />The musics are great as well.
B0011Z32PS|5.0|enough said.these guys just shake the house when you crank it up. This album may be old but it is still rocking.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I am a big fan of &#34;Alien,&#34; and was expecting a similar type of movie, which is a horror movie in Space.  Unfortunately, &#34;Prometheus&#34; is another Sci-Fi movie with lots of special effects, love interest, and shallow plot; not scary at all.  Shame on you, Ridley Scott.
B0099114WO|4.0|In August 2012, a new comedy titled \\"Hope Springs\\" from David Frankel (director of \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"Marley and Me\\") was released in theaters.<br /><br />Written by Vanessa Taylor (\\"Alias\\", \\"Gideon's Crossing\\") and starring Meryl Streep (\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", \\"Doubt\\", \\"Adaptation\\"), Tommy Lee Jones (\\"No Country For Old Men\\", \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"Men in Black\\" films), Steve Carell (\\"The Office\\", \\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\\", \\"Crazy Stupid Love\\"), Jean Smart (\\"Designing Women\\", \\"Graden State\\"), Elisabeth Shue (\\"Back to the Future\\" films, \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\"), Ben Rappaport (\\"Outsourced\\", \\"The Brass Teapot\\") and Marin Ireland (\\"I Am Legend\\", \\"Revolutionary Road\\", \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\").<br /><br />Receiving positive reviews for the performances by Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell, \\"Hope Springs\\" did well in the box office (considering the summer blockbuster competition) as the film budgeted at $30 million would go on to earn over $104,000.  And now, \\"Hope Springs\\" will be released on DVD in December 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Hope Springs\\" is presented in 2:40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen and is presented in English and French 5.1 Dolby Digital and also presented with an English - Audio Description Track.  It is important to note that for those who want the best picture and audio quality, there is a Blu-ray release version available for \\"Hope Springs\\".  Picture and audio quality are good as expected on DVD.  Some scenes may be a bit dark at times but for the most part, the film does look good on DVD and the soundtrack is primarily dialogue and music-driven and audio primarily coming through the front and center channels.  But for a movie like \\"Hope Springs\\", PQ and AQ on DVD is good.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Hope Springs\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  Commentary with Director David Frankel - Featuring an informative audio commentary by director David Frankel.<br />  Gag-Reel - (5:07) Bloopers from \\"Hope Springs\\".<br />  Inside the Perfect Movie Marriage: Meryl Streep & Tommy Lee Jones - (3:53) Brief interview with Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones who talk about their characters and the film.<br />  Exploring the Scene - Alternate Takes Gallery - (17:48) Featuring four alternate takes: Motel Speech, Marital Gripes, First Time You Said It and Feld's Second Wife with optional introductions by director David Frankel.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Hope Springs\\" comes with an UltraViolet code which allows owners to download the film to their computer and select Apple and Android devices and have the ability to stream to computers, tables or smartphones.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />An enjoyable comedy with a storyline that should have been made long ago.<br /><br />\\"Hope Springs\\" is a storyline that many older adults can relate to. It's one thing to be in love and grow old with your partner, but how does one keep the passion strong and alive?<br /><br />I don't know how many couples I have known that are like the characters Arnold and Kaye.  Couples who are devoted with one another, but somehow intimacy has decreased a lot as the years go by.<br /><br />As I get older, I find it fascinating how conversation with my friends have changed when it comes to relationship topics when we were in our 20′s and then in our 30′s and now in our 40′s and some friends who are in their 50′s or 60′s.  There are many men and women who simply give up the intimacy and when I hear from guys who get all bummed out when they tell me they had not had any sexual intimacy with their wife in years, suffice to say, it's sad to hear that older couples just give up the intimacy or no longer into it.<br /><br />So, for years, I have always wondered when a film would be created on the subject.  We always see movies about the new couple who have children and lose intimacy but what about the older couples?<br /><br />Yes, I understand that Hollywood doesn't focus on older couples as much anymore.  When I really think about it, the films that have explored it took place back in the '90s with films such as \\"Father of the Bride 2″ which starred Steve Martin and his wife who is older but is expecting a baby, along with her daughter who is also about to give birth.<br /><br />But there aren't any films that tackle on intimacy.  And maybe it's because it's something that many Americans face when they get older and some may consider it a depressing topic because perhaps intimacy for many couples don't exist or are as not as strong when one gets older.<br /><br />That's why I really enjoyed \\"Hope Springs\\" and its message of how couples, no matter how great their marriage is, both need to try and become intimate.  It's one thing to hug and to hold but open communication about one's needs in a relationship, no matter what age you are, is important.<br /><br />And the performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep feel natural.  Arnold is a man who is uncomfortable discussing his sexual fantasies or problems with a doctor, while Kaye feels this is the only way she can get her husband to be intimate by bringing in professional help.  Meryl Streep is a wonderful actress and to see both she and Tommy Lee Jones having fun in the film, not only was it fun to watch but I found myself hoping that many other couples who have lost that spark, maybe will try to regain it with their loved one right after watching this film!  It's quite inspiring and definitely a film that just makes you feel good because it is a film about relationships but also hope despite the problems a married (or unmarried) couple may have despite the many decades they have been together.<br /><br />Along with Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep, the performance by Steve Carell was also rather fascinating.  No comedy role or weird facial gestures, Carell plays the straight up Dr. Feld and is intent in helping this couple achieve true intimacy.  It's possibly the most serious role I have seen Carell be part of and it's great to see him trying something different and not be the actual funny man of the film.<br /><br />As for the DVD, as mentioned in my review, while PQ and AQ are good on DVD, for those wanting the best picture quality and lossless audio, will definitely want to watch this film on Blu-ray.  Otherwise, the DVD does look and sounds good and also includes special features such as audio commentary, gag reel, interviews with Streep and Jones plus a featurette with alternate scenes.<br /><br />An enjoyable, fun, mature comedy for adults and \\"Hope Springs\\" is a film long overdue.  Also, a film featuring fantastic, believable and heartwarming performances by Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.

B005LAIHPE|5.0|I am not a movie critic but if you like SciFi you will enjoy this movie. It is like a combination of TopGun ( top Ship ),Alien and Transformers all in one movie. Any military movie fans or Navy fans will enjoy this flick too!
B008B3H4VQ|2.0|All the songs sound about the same. Wish they would go back to more rock sound. To much techno in their music now, too bad because I really liked their stuff when they first came out.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I enjoy mellow songs and they did a great job of doing so. It has a softness to it which I particularly love. I got into it through their hit song &#34;Little Talks,&#34; and purchased the album shortly afterwards. The music has a sense of gloominess and sadness to it. I think those who prefer that kind of music will enjoy them. Their style is different from the everyday R&B which is refreshing.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|From the creators of \\"Lost\\" and \\"Tron: Legacy\\" writers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz comes a new fantasy-drama television series known as \\"Once Upon a Time\\".<br /><br />Originally conceived before Kitsis and Horowitz were involved with \\"Lost\\", both men wanted to write a fairtytale and the exploration of other worlds. But with their work on \\"Lost\\", the writers had the opportunity to learn from the process, and while having some allusions to \\"Lost\\", the series also has allusions to well-known Disney films. But the goal for both writers was to take these characters that people are familiar with and to explore the character and get to learn more about them.  But most importantly, not retelling the exact same story as what people may be familiar with from the original fairy tale.<br /><br />With the 22-episode series debuting in October 2011 and a season finale in May of 2012, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" was the highest-rated TV drama for Adults 18-49 and was ABC's biggest debut in five years.  As well as being the highest rated non-sports program to air on Sunday nights.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1 aspect ratio).  The picture quality for this series is fantastic.  With its high production value, one expects a lot for this series and for an ABC drama series, one of the few that has been given a Blu-ray release.<br /><br />Closeups are very good, showing excellent detail from skin pores to the grime on people's faces.  The location shots are breathtaking, especially during the fairytale sequences and costume design also showcase excellent detail.  Skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and I didn't see any problems with banding, especially during the scenes which featured a lot of orange or red.<br /><br />Overall, picture quality for \\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete Season\\" was fantastic!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />\\"Once Upon a Time\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and English 2.0 Dolby Digital.  The series is crystal clear when it comes to dialogue and music.  While the series is center and front-channel driven, I did like how surround channels were used at times during the action sequences but primarily you hear the musical score through the surround channels.  I wished it was bit more immersive when it comes to its lossless soundtrack but the dialogue and music is crystal clear.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />\\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for \\"Piot\\" by co-creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz<br />  Once Upon a Time Orchestral Suite - (4:05) listen to the music of \\"Once Upon a Time\\".<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for \\"7:15 a.m.\\" with Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas.<br /><br />DISC 3:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary  - Featuring audio commentary for \\"Skin Deep\\" with actor Robert Carlyle and writer Jane Espenson.<br /><br />DISC 4:<br /><br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for \\"The Stable Boy\\" with co-creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz with actress Lana Parilla.<br /><br />DISC 5:<br /><br />  Once Upon a Time: Origins - Josh Dallas narrates the exploration of the origins of fairy tales \\"Snow White\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Rumplestiltskin\\".<br />  Fairy Tales in the Modern World - (20:27) Learn of what inspired the drama series \\"Once Upon a Time\\" and what fairy tales the cast and crew remember the most.<br />  Building Character - (7:20) Creation of new fairy tales and a look at the character of Emily.<br />  Welcome to Storybrooke - (6:46) A visit to Stevestown near Vancouver, the location of Storybrooke.<br />  The Story I Remember...Snow White - (4:29) How the cast remember \\"Snow White\\" and their interpretation and ideas of the fairy tale character.<br />  Fairest Bloopers of Them All - (2:20) Outtakes from \\"Once Upon a Time\\".<br />  Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for \\"A Land Without Magic\\" with co-creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and actress Jennifer Morrison.<br />  Deleted Scenes - (12:53) A total of nine deleted scenes.<br /><br />EASTER EGGS:<br /><br />  Swordfight Scene - (1:47) Press Down on Episodes on Disc 5 and you will see the making of the swordfight scene from \\"Pilot\\".<br />  Cars of \\"Once Upon a Time\\" - (1:06) The vehicles featured in \\"Once Upon a Time.

ABC's \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is a groundbreaking drama series on primetime television.<br /><br />High production value, writers that come from hit shows such as \\"LOST\\" and \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and utilizing fairy tale characters, the potential is pretty much unlimited of how far the writers can go.<br /><br />And what adds to the efficacy of the series is its talented ensemble cast, cinematography and overall direction.<br /><br />Let's begin with the storyline.  While \\"Once Upon a Time\\" has been compared to \\"LOST\\" because of its two timelines, \\"LOST\\" had its limitations as everyone was stuck on an island and writers could go only go so far with its ensemble cast.  With \\"Once Upon a Time\\", you're dealing with the small town of Storybrooke, many characters that can be introduced with each episode, characters that can have an impact on another character's modern and fairytale storyline.<br /><br />As a viewer, you root for the underdogs, which are Emma, the main protagonist and young Henry.  You are captivated by these two characters because Emma is strong, intelligent but she is also alone.  And to have her son that she gave up for adoption wanting her, needing her and accompanying her, it's rather touching.  But then you have this sci-fi side to the story of Henry trying to convince his mother that everyone in Storybrooke is under a curse and are unable to remember their previous life.<br /><br />And while the modern storyline focuses on Emma and Henry, getting a glimpse of the fairy tale storyline that surround Prince Charming, Snow White, Cinderella, Jiminy Cricket, the Huntsman, to name a few, we start to see a juxtaposition of the lives they lived and how things are going for them in today's modern time.<br /><br />The acting is magnificent.  Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas as Snow White and Prince Charming have wonderful chemistry and their scenes are quite demanding as they require a lot of action sequences, having them in many costumes and fighting evil anywhere in the forest or via greens creen (or not) near rocky cliffs.  The series also brings a new dynamic to these characters beyond what many of us have read or seen in a Disney film.  Snow White is more authoritative, a go-getter not this character that loves to sing and play with birds.  Her depiction in \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is fantastic, while Prince Charming is your banal swashbuckling hero but instead of being the driven-man, there is a storyline that revolves twins and one being killed, a moral dilemma which revolves around bloodline and commitment towards marriage and with so much story that goes into their fairytale and modern characters, Goodwin and Dallas have to deliver and they do!<br /><br />Then you have Lana Parrilla as Regina Mills/Evil Queen.  The actress is able to play the evil character wonderfully, with this scheming look on her face and evil grin.  Casting was on the mark for this character and instead of beingan older woman queen, the Evil Queen is given sex appeal and becomes one of the more interesting characters in the series.<br /><br />And Robert Carlyle, a man who is evil but also a mystery if he can be good or just a person that marches in the beat of his own drum and you don't know whether or not you can trust him.  His character of Rumpelstiltskin may seem a bit weak towards the beginning of the series but you begin to realize that this grimy imp is far from being weak, in fact, he may be the most powerful antagonist of the series but also an antagonist that can either aid the side of good and evil.  Or neither, but himself.  A character that you just don't know what he will do and constantly surprises the viewer by his actions.  Carlyle does an amazing job in playing this character, may it be the psychotic Rumpelstiltskin or the cool and calm Mr. Gold.<br /><br />Then we have Jennifer Morrison, your protagonist with a no-nonsense, strong Sarah Connor-type of attitude but deep inside, you see her character becoming more emotional as she starts to show her love for the son that she gave up.  I enjoy the character of Emma a lot and for the most part, it's going to be interesting to see how things continue in season 2 with how things were left in the season finale.<br /><br />The character performances in the series, especially with the supporting talent are well-done as well!<br /><br />Another big plus is the cinematography and location shots.  From the beautiful location of shooting in the forest for action sequences to shooting in Vancouver for Storybrooke, you get a combination of beautiful location shots along with small town America.  The fairytale storyline is what is most appealing because of its high production value, action sequences and costume design.<br /><br />And last but not least, the writing of this show is phenomenal.  I'm a big fan of Jane Espenson's work but to also have a few of the writers, especially series creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz of \\"LOST\\", another series that I enjoyed immensely is a major plus.  Both men had this vision prior to \\"Lost\\" and it's great to see this type of series on ABC.<br /><br />The writing is captivating, amazingly well-done and definitely a lot of potential for exploration of other characters which can be utilized whenever. But with the way that season 1 has ended, it will be interesting to see how things go for season 2.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality is amazing while lossless soundtrack was crystal clear when it came to dialogue and music, I was hoping for it to be a bit more immersive in utilizing the surround channels and LFE a bit more during the more action-driven scenes.  As for special features, you do get several audio commentary, featurettes including Easter eggs.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" has turned out to be a fantastic sci-fi drama series.  So many positives can be said of the show and at this point of time, there are no negative things I have to say about it.  Granted, this is the first season and hopefully things get better for season 2.<br /><br />Captivating, addictive and in my opinion, one of the best drama series on television at this time, \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is a unique, well-acted, well-written drama series that will win you over with its initial pilot episode to its thrilling season final.  It's that good!<br /><br />\\"Once Upon a Time: The Complete First Season\\" is highly recommended!ogs, which are Emma, the main protagonist and young Henry.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Can't get enough- this show is so creepy and alluring and the acting is incredible , Zachary Quinto might be the creepiest actor of 2012
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Plot and storyline well developed. Easy to read and easy to follow. Spouse has read most of the early King novels. I prefered 11/22/63.
B005QUQP76|1.0|just got this from amazon, paid for 2 day shipping to get it quickly.  looking and feeling it, it is a nice mouse.  i plugged it in and away i went.  to properly use the mouse you have to update the firmware and install the software.  I downloaded the software and firmware updates. installed the software. firmware wouldn't update.  kept trying,  no luck.  went online to find the problem.  turns out you can only update the firmware on a USB2.0 port, I got a new computer a few months ago and it only has USB3.0.<br /><br />plain aweful a company release something that uses older technology and no way to use new equiptment.  USB3.0 has been out for a while, get with the times.<br /><br />at worst, they should put a big label on the product saying it only uses USB2.0<br /><br />I will never buy from Corsair again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Pretty cool game. My 4 year old daughter really likes it. It gets a lot harder for her as it progresses but she still enjoys it, so do I.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This was my very first movie purchase from Amazon that only can be viewed from their library. I wanted to see if it was worth buying it online rather than purchasing the actual discs. I realized the sound of the movie is a bit shaky for me and I need subtitles in order to understand what the actors are saying. Once I turn up the volume to hear them, the explosions in the background become unbearably loud where I'll have to reduce the volume again. I seriously dislike having to worry about if the movie is disturbing others, which takes my focus away from the film, and not getting the full experience. I stopped buying movies online unless I can confirm that subtitles will be available for them.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a great game!  If you need to past the time then this is the game for you to play.  Fast and a lot of fun.
B000JCQCW4|5.0|This is the greatest movie a wayans has ever been in. However the pricing is not conducive to gaining more digital media customers. If I can buy the DVD for $5 at target, why can't I buy the digital copy for $4?  There's no physical media, so lets get the prices where they should be.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|Great book. This book is for those who don't simply follow the straight and narrow. It fills in a lot of blanks.
B007US9NA8|5.0|The names says all.  Its really a lovely book. As you go on reading it gives you a wonderful feeling.
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn is the best radio app out there. I can listen to local radio stations or artist specific stations i.e. Prince. A must have!!!
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I had never heard of this artist until I ran into him on Youtube while listening to 2 Steps from Hell. I honestly feel like many of the songs would fit very well into a movie where a lot of action is taking place or will be taking place. There are also a songs where it's a bit more mellow and sorrowful as well. I honestly believe the author did a great job of keeping a variety and entertaining me. I'm not exactly sure what kind of category he falls under, but if you like &#34;epic&#34; soundtracks then you may want to give him a go.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Everything that Vince Flynn has written has been awesome. This was not my favorite Mitch Rapp book, but it kept me up too late at night reading it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The godfather series of movies is perhaps one of the best movie and sequels ever. I paid probably $75 some years back for the DVD boxed set. So $13 for the same set on bluray a is fair for 3 movies. All bluray and digital media should be in that sweet spot of under $4/movie. Remember, a lot of us have paid 3 x before they're done. At the theater, for the DVD and again for the bluray.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's complete and thorough. I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. I'm about to check weather at home or anywhere I need it.
142314189X|5.0|First heard of this when my kid from school mentioned another classmate was reading this and had taken it out of the library.  I read the first few pages and it kept my interest so I ordered the entire series.  Story suspense and witt pretty similar to Harry Potter series.  Gone through first 3 books of the 5 book series, on my 4th now.  Delivery was super fast and secure packaging.  I would recommend downloading a preview this via ibook on the apple product which gives you like the first chapter plus of each book or through kindle on the amazon/android platform.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my daughter and i love to play this together.seems like young kids game but i still enjoying playing this game. love all the animals and goals.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I really hated this app. it was hands down the worse app I have ever downloaded. really glad I didn't buy it.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Mechanical Animals is a well-crafted album that I've been after for some time and finally I decided to buy it on Amazon. When I received my product, I noticed that the CD had a crack on the front case. I was upset that the product came like this because I'm collecting CD's and Manson is one of my favorite artists so I really like to maintain a mint condition. What made it worse was that it was the tour edition. The front case was blue so I couldn't simply swap it for another. I was pleased to know that I owned the tour copy, but I just wish it wasn't cracked.<br /><br />Back to reviewing the music, Manson's lyrics flow well with the melodies and are pretty inspirational and poetic. The beats to some of the more faster paced songs are just right to where you want to tap your foot and/or nod your head to the music. I also particularly liked the album artwork; Very creative and sci-fi. If you like Manson at all, you will buy this masterpiece. It's golden and very exotic. 5/5.
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|When its cheaper to buy the DVD and rip it, that's what many will do. Shouldbe four buck or less, but that's a movie company issue.
0670023329|5.0|This harrowing story reveals a life that is difficult to imagine. It is difficult to imagine the circumstances the author lived through. The book provides a background about North Korea's prison camps and and daily life. The story is detailed and provides a striking story. His luck in escaping from prison and crossed the border into China is revealing about North Korea's corruption. This is a story not to be missed. An excellent follow-up is One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Solzhenitsyn.

034580404X|5.0|I would definitely recommend it! I wasn't sure about it at first because of the BDSM, but everyone kept praising it so I had to try it! Sure glad I did because once I began to read it I couldn't put it down! It's not a raunchy sex book, it's a love story that teaches trust & commitment, and yes some interesting sex acts too but not hardcore or crude!  If you have an open mind this  is a love story which will gently teach you about BDSM as the main character learns herself, if you are a prude this book is not for you!
B003X7MCGW|5.0|Good deal on a classic rock album that one can listen to in any decade. I like that I can play this on my iphone.
B007N5YJWK|1.0|I am a recent fan of this film and (having watched the crappy transfer they have on Amazon Instant Video) I was delighted to see a Criterion edition - particularly for the special features included.<br /><br />Sadly, this page is incredibly misleading.<br /><br />I did not purchase the BluRay because I thought I was saving a few dollars. Fool me once, shame on you.<br /><br />Amazon should change the listing to make it very clear that the DVD is the same crappy (shaky, bad sound) transfer they have available for streaming. The intro / outro by Tony Curtis makes it even more painful.<br /><br />The \\"trailer\\" on the DVD is not even for the 39 Steps - it is for North by Northwest, which adds insult to injury.<br /><br />I am asking for a refund.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 52 years old, post-menopause and somewhat fit for my age; just getting flabby and losing muscle tone and gaining those extra inches around the tummy and waist.  I started 30 day shred 3 weeks ago.  I must admit; I haven't been really faithful to it as I should. I stayed on week one for 2 weeks just because it was so intense.  I couldn't get through the crawl push ups; killer.  Now I am doing week 2 and guess what?  Amazing things are happening!  I wake up in the morning with a zing! Not a struggle to sit up and get out of bed.  Running up a flight of stairs at the school I work at is much easier. I actually have more energy than the kids! What's more, I can already see a difference in my bod.  My chest and back feel more toned and my abs have an itty bitty 2 pack.  Yes!  This is a killer work out but it's only 30 minutes; perfect for those crunched for time. I love it because I don't have to pack up and go to the gym or fight traffic and stress out driving somewhere. Jillian is right there in my living room with me, kicking my butt and whipping me into shape. Let me tell you: this work out will NOT work if you don't push \\"PLAY\\" and get up out of your chair and do the exercises.  You have to move and \\"bring it\\"!  I am very pleased with my results so far and can't wait to get to week 3.  Love you hate you Jillian!!!!
B0057UA486|5.0|Very interesting Thackeray tale spanning 3 hours with fantastic scenery and sets that make this a great work indeed....the story takes many twists and turns with never a dull moment.... Definite Kubrick masterwork that looks excellent on blu-ray....purposely filmed a tad softly, this one doesn't have the crystal clarity one expects from a 1080P presentation, but it looks just fine--and the 5.1 sound is very good with decent separation and low end....well worth it for those who haven't seen it....great stuff....

B000209ZAE|4.0|I start my review with a challenge, based on the price, find a micro drill stand that beat this product. I love shopping for tools, I have been to a few corners of Asian markets I have not found one that matches the quality of this drill stand. It puts many bigger sized drill stand/press to shame.<br /><br />The level action is moderately smooth, the alloy cast body clamps the stainless column, it rubs the stainless column as it moves up and down. The assembly must be well lubricated for smooth action, this means grabbing the stainless column will leave your hands oily. If the stainless column is left ill maintained, it will start to wear. However, the design of the drill stand results in extra precision where drill runout is almost eliminated. I have used it to make deep holes with carbide drill bits and I have yet to break any.<br /><br />The level also has a positive feedback from the vibration of the drill bit. This results in more control. There's a drill depth stop which works very well. The alloy drill table is machined flat and beautifully finished. Additional holes can be tapped for vice attachment.<br /><br />One of the cons with this drill stand is that it doesn't drill in an angle, although the collar attachment allows for rotation, it only turns the tool. The drilling action is always 90 degree up and down. The column is fixed. A seperate angle vise must be fitted to drill in an angle. I wish there's an optional laser attachment where I can drill with less guess work. The collar attachment is not universal for all tools it only fits Proxxon tools.<br /><br />Overall this is a must have for making precision drilling. I am really glad that Proxxon produced this budget jewel. I wished all tools were made like this then we will have more time for work and less time fiddling with cheaply made tools.

I gets lots of complements. I wear an 8 to 8 1/2 W so I ordered size 9 and the fit great. I have had them about a month and they are super comfortable.
B008Y5OWMK|5.0|A long movie with complex characters and a slowly evolving plot. It shows the true immigrant spirit who came to this country seeking opportunity and wanting to solidify their communities with contrasting the early opportunistic and ever evolving greed of the already settled \\"Americans.\\" And yea, it is fiction.<br />An absolute excellent movie! I'm proud to slide the DVD into my 125+ Best Westerns of All Time Library!

1565117808|4.0|\\"It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names.\\"<br /><br />Pi Patel is a young man living with his parents in India, caring for their zoo. When he turns 16, his father decides to sell the zoo and the animals and move the family to Canada. They book a ride on a ship, but things go wrong when the ship goes down. Now Pi must survive on a lifeboat with a tiger, the animal his father taught him to fear the most.<br /><br />A good friend of mine gave me the audiobook. Several of my friends have told me this is a great book, a must read. I don't know WHY it took me so long to read \\"Life of Pi\\", but I finally rectified that problem. And my friends are right: this is a really good read!<br /><br />Probably one of my favorite points about this book is the character and voice of Pi Patel himself. Since, in many ways, this is very much a character novel, Pi is a very important part of the book. And I thought Martel wrote him beautifully. I liked reading about a Person of Color, instead of yet another American boy. I liked his Point of View: he was smart, intelligent, clever, not rude, arrogant, or obnoxious. He respected his parents; he respected other adults; he was worried about more than that girl's tail to chase. And Pi was resourceful. He never gave up, kept trying to survive, relied on faith and his wits to keep going.<br /><br />Technically, there aren't a whole lot of other characters. Pi's parents appear only in the first half; the tiger, I suppose, could be considered a character, but his actions were more to push Pi than to reveal something about himself. There is a second POV that seems to be about an interviewer, but again, the focus is (appropriately) on Pi, not the interviewer. But although there aren't many other characters, I thought they were well-done. The parents were PEOPLE, not stupid idiots, blissfully ignorant of their son (though Pi did throw them for a loop occasionally). Pi's teachers and classmates were PEOPLE. They were realistic and helped lend credibility to Pi's story.<br /><br />So what is Pi's story? I think that is one of the most intriguing things of the book. Pi is shipwrecked on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific ocean with a live tiger. His life on the boat is a series of trials - from finding water to rationing supplies to catching fish to keeping his spirits up enough to WANT to survive. There is another aspect of the story, one you learn at the very end, which gives an interesting twist to the story. I wasn't too surprised, as I had heard things about this book and kind expected it (it also reminded me of a few movies I've seen - what do you believe, a person's experience or what you see with your own eyes?). But that doesn't mean the twist was bad.<br /><br />Probably about the only thing that I didn't like was the amount of exposition into the animals of the zoo, the running of the zoo, some of the religious meanderings, and how long Pi's stay on the ocean was. They were interesting asides, but sometimes I felt it took too long to get to the meat of the story.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written, thoughtful novel about survival, about truth, and about hope. I smack myself mentally, wondering how I went so long without reading it. I definitely recommend checking it out, seeing if it is something that floats your boat.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*Pi's teachers and classmates were PEOPLE.

B003CSV7TK|5.0|Reminds me of home. Always watched on thanksgiving day after the Macy's Parade. Very disapointed that the &#34;Powers that be&#34; have not put it on TV. Now, I get to watch when ever I want.

B0086700CM|5.0|its so addicting! it teaches you how to play while you play and the goals are perfect! they're small enough so that they're not impossible, but big enough so that they're a challenge.
B009LUBA7M|4.0|His sound has definitely matured and developed!  If you're just looking for a repeat of his first album, this may not hit the spot for you.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I loved the series and them movie was awesome! The product came as described and was the cheapest price around!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|After the Bruno scene, it will keep loading his office for the HO scenes and will not change to the correct scene! If you reboot, you get a screwed up background instead. This worked fine on a non-Amazon tablet, regular Android, earlier in the year. I gave 3 stars because I like the game and there were no problems on the regular Android. But this is listed as available for my Amazon device so it should be working better!!

1575666286|3.0|It is a bit informative.  It is rather easy to read but doesn't contain enough information on the pros and cons of the therapy and how it could potentially impact a patient.

B004UXUUDA|4.0|There has been many films about the extermination of jews.  This is a good one.  It bring the story from a different angle: how does someone feel about benefitting from the misfortune of the jews that were exterminated.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I agree with allot of the reviews good and bad and I was stuck the first time seeing the film because I enjoyed the Jason Bourne trilogy so much (top ten action movies IMO) I do think they slowed the flow of the movie in attempting to connect it with the other films, time I think should have been used developing the main characters. Judging it on its own merits however makes it a damn good action thriller, Jeremy Renner slides into the Agent/Operator role naturally displaying the demeanor of a elite operator as much as the physical know how to back it up. I like that its not a clean cut, suave, smooth tongued James Bond film. Once I stopped comparing and connecting to the first 3 Bourne films. I got into it and time flew.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|*Warning: Spoilers*<br /><br />First, let me just go ahead and set aside the inconsistencies between the events of TDK and the setting of TDKR and simply review the movie itself. I thought that it started well. The beginning felt a bit slow at times but the events were relevant to the overall plot of the movie. It got better and better until the scene where Batman finally shows up on the bike, and then I thought \\"This movie is going to be epic!\\" Unfortunately, that was where it peaked. Following that scene, it slowly devolved into a weak and strung out film that wasn't really sure where it wanted to go; multiple scenes at the \\"courthouse\\", random shots of the bomb being driven around, an unnecessary side plot of special forces guys trying to infiltrate the city, Bruce trying over and over to get out of the pit, police officers eating food in the sewer, and why or when did Batman spend time drawing up the bat-symbol on the bridge when there was only hours left until the bomb exploded?<br /><br />I also felt bringing in the world at large was a mistake. Batman was always at its best when it was about Gotham's struggles, and the dynamic between Batman and the villains within that microcosm. Bringing in the military and special forces and all that cheapened the film and his role. It also seems like a nuclear bomb on the loose would be a problem that the country would take a little more seriously that \\"ok we'll block the roads and give you whatever you want and sneak in 3 (really? only 3?) special forces guys, and when that fails we'll hope that Batman sneaks back in and saves the city.\\" It just wasn't plausible. There's a couple different ways they could have easily kept the same story line without have to bring in outside players.<br /><br />All in all I thought it started down the right track, but drug on longer than needed and was a so-so finale to the Christian Bale Batman era.
B008GFI4KY|3.0|This is a fun record, with some enjoyable hooks and fun songs all around. There are no particularly weak points here, but it also lacks some of the peaks of their previous records. Still, if you think you might like it, you probably will. I recommend it.

This isn't an amazing review, because I'm short on time, but I HAD to get something in here (there are so few reviews!) ASAP. Buy this book. It's cheap, it's incredible, and you will love it.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|This is a great addition to my running playlist. I'm never sure if the lyrics are sincere, over the top, or sincerely over the top. A solid record either way.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It's an entertaining book that will keep you turning the pages for a few days. It starts out a bit slow, gains a lot of momentum, and disappoints in the end. The falling apart of the plot in the end is the main reason why I am only giving three stars.<br /><br />There are three main things that bothered me with this book:<br /><br />1: The author is obviously a jazz fan and thinks it is necessary to write about jazz repeatedly.<br />2: Bosch's eating habits reflect the American stereotype who eats nothing other than burgers, pizza, tacos, etc.<br />3: As I mentioned above, the book runs out of steam in the last few chapters.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: I have noticed that Connelly's books are fairly predictable in that the last few chapters involve violence, shooting, and a few dead bodies. After such an elaborate setup of the plot, it's a bit trivial how it all ends.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|I love the series. Characters, plot, sets, acting and filming is great. This is really a review of the DVDs. The extras are okay but limited: a &#34;making of&#34; short, a short about the real house, another about costumes. There are no commentary tracks. There are no introductions a la Masterpiece Theater: they are completely non-existent for season 1, and for season 2 you get Laura Linney saying who she is and that funding is made possible by viewers like you. That's it for the introduction. The subtitles are often inadequate -- they may pop up for only half a second or when something else is being said. There are no subtitles at all on the extras. Given that my local PBS does full-season marathons and that I have a DVR, I'm not sure that the DVD set was worth my money.

This is book 5 of the series: A song of Ice and fire, Dance with Dragons continues the story that Game of Thrones began.  Our whole family of 6 have been reading the series (I start them and then pass the books on when I am finished).  I actually had to buy this one on my Kindle in addition to having the hardback because my daughter was too impatient to wait for me to finish!  We are true die hard Song of Ice and Fire fans!

0316228532|5.0|J. K. Rowling proves herself a master of her craft in this novel.  With her characteristic razor sharp wit she shows us the thoughts, motives and inner monologues of a rather large array of characters.  Male, female, teenagers to grandparents, her characters are gradually developed in such a way that we understand (even if we dislike) the actions they take... or do not take.  In so doing, Rowling offers a brilliant and unflinching commentary on human nature as well as a compelling story of the profound effects humans have on one another, both positive and negative.<br /><br />By the time I came to the last 150 pages, I could not put the book down because I felt invested in the characters, the story and its outcome.  I would give The Casual Vacancy 6 stars if I could.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game does not repeat the same format repeatedly. Not a lot of &quot;commercials&quot; for a free app.  Very difficult to get three stars though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This movie is constant action always something to look forward to all the rest. Can not wait to see whats next.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|Very meaningful movie specially for long time married couples who are about to lose their interest in each other. This movie will show you how to improve your life style and become someone you never thought of!
B007EDYN36|4.0|wow, pretty sad story really. however I didn't put it down. Glad to know others see Paul Stanley the way I do, super ladylike.  I feel for Peter Criss though, to even be able to deal with a gene and Paul ganging up on you would be awful. He had the voice and songs outta the whole band.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|a really fun strategy game. i played against my significant other and we had a blast. i highly reccomend this game
B007REV4T8|1.0|Until Skyfall, Daniel Craig, as James Bond, was an inspired characterization. In the earlier two Craig/Bond movies we had a glimpse of the inner Bond, along with a manly grittiness which lent a degree of realism to the character.<br /><br />In Skyfall, Bond is barely recognizable as our hero. Indeed, his appearance is that of an aged alcoholic. He reeks of weakness and his incompetence is manifest. He undergoes testing to confirm his mastery of the tools of his trade--and fails utterly. He cannot even hit a man-size target with a handgun at 20-30 feet.<br /><br />The best that can be said of Skyfall is that the first half of the movie was reasonably interesting. The remainder was boring and unforgivably predictable.<br /><br />My girlfriend observed that it was as if the director loathed the James Bond character. Consistently, Craig/Bond was shown in the worst possible light: His clothes were ill-fitting and from a bygone age; he was weepy, unsure of himself, and a physical wreck. His visage was of one who had recently spent long masturbatory hours at a peep show.<br /><br />Finally, even in a Bond movie, it is an unacceptable assault on our credulity for our hero to be wounded by one round to the shoulder, another round to the body from a high velocity rifle, take an uncontrolled fall for a couple of hundred meters into water--and survive.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I would reccomend this movie to anyone.  Well writen with lots of action the next season should be better than the first.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|nowhere in the description did it explain that this required downloading the android app store for access.  I gave my son permission to buy it and next thing I knew I had no amazon app store.  I had to reset to factory settings because it installed as a system setting.  rediculous.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Wanted to watch this for awhile it was definitely worth it. Action gods and the little guy saves the day
B000OZ0N9E|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough for software architects designing applications that interact in any way with another outside system.  With today's movement towards cloud computing and always-online environments, that's practically everything.  Going further, when you consider that an application can coordinate its own interaction with internal subsystems using Enterprise Integration Patterns, this design philosophy truly applies everywhere.  Enterprise Integration Patterns take to the next level the same separation-of-concerns principles that [[ASIN:0201633612 Object-Oriented Design]] introduced, teaching us encapsulation of entire systems regardless of architecture.    This won't be the most in-depth review, but I'd encourage you to visit these two sites for a deeper exploration of the topic:  [...][...]    --  Apache's extensive Java reference implementation, including a nice Wiki with example use cases and creative recipes.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I have tried to read this but can't get interested but will try again soon. Anxious to try to give it another chance.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I listen to this CD when driving long distances thru bumper to bumper traffic, very soothing, Whe just has a way of calming my restless mind.
B0090SVDUO|5.0|The Doors Live At The Bowl '68 is simply incredible! I bought the 2LP 180g Vinyl Set and the sound is so warm and rich. The quality of the vinyl and packaging is very nice. This is perhaps one of the best Doors concerts ever and they did an excellent job putting this record together. Highly recommend!
B005PR44XC|5.0|I've read a few great books this year, including two other Michael Lewis books, but this was a brilliant read, one which I was sad to finish! A must read for all - financially minded or not!

B001C08RHA|1.0|cd wouldn't read half way through. wouldn't recommend. do not buy this. you have been warned. not sure what else to write
0345803485|1.0|I hated this story. The plot was so slow, and really how many young incrediably wealthy men are out there in the world searching for a plain 20 year old virgins. I dont underatnd the craze.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Read this book because several of my teenage students said it was good, and I wanted to see what they were reading.  Ended up liking the series myself.  Definitely for the younger audience, but good all the same.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was the first Jodi Picoult book I have read, a friend of mine recommended it.<br />I just have to say that I absolutely loved it. You get involved so deeply within all characters and I just loved it all.<br />I will definitely be reading more from this author for sure :)
B0086700CM|4.0|fun and addicting. I could play this game for hours. Altho I might end up throwing my kindle against a wall xD
B005IQZB14|5.0|Occasionally one begins reading a book that can't be put down whilst making one desperate for it never to end. This is such a book and well worthy of its NYC Times top rating.<br />As an occasional hiker in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado I vicariously walked each step of the way with Cheryl amazed at how she keep each day fresh and alive on what I know can, in part, be a. boring journey.<br />I am awed by her storytelling ability and amazed at her fortitude. I will be giving this book to several people for Christmas and beyond.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is purely a thinking man`s game.  You will find yourself thinking about how to conquer each hole and each level. It is easy to play with simple graphics. I do wish when a new challenge is offered, an explanation was offered. It is really an addictive game for this 48 year-old professional and for my 7 year-old son.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I guess I like this app.  I have played better apps but this one is ok.I also recommend pet shop story and pet hotel if you liked this app.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|I'll try to not go on a tangent about how very much I love Arctic Monkeys (this album included), but rather a small comparison: Suck It And See is a wonderful departure from the Arctic Monkeys' other albums whilst still capturing their divine essence and musical flavor.<br /><br />The quality of the CD itself was commendable and averagely clean. thank you & stay fresh
B005EXA8XC|5.0|This Blu-ray concert, Nirvana: Live at the Paramount, is an absolute keeper for any Nirvana fan!  It was recorded a month or so after the release of Nevermind--way before Nevermind's success got the better of Cobain and his live performances started to suffer.<br /><br />The video quality was better than I expected--especially since the concert was originally shot using 16mm film.  The grain from the film is noticeable, but definitely not objectionable.  The 16mm film may not take full advantage of the Blu-ray format, but the concert still has significantly more detail and resolution than a standard definition DVD.  The sound on my DTS enabled receiver was awesome!  Every portion of Grohl's drum kit (every cymbal hit), the vocals, and Kurt's guitar, was clear, clean, and punchy!!<br /><br />Note: If you've been reading the reviews for the Blu-ray version of this concert here on Amazon, you'll notice a LOT of people have been having problems with the video being out of sync with the audio.  My local retailer was aware of the problem and said he would offer me a store credit if it didn't play properly on my player.  For what it's worth, my copy played fine from start to finish (with no sync issues) on my older (2009) Samsung Blu-ray player (model BD-P1600).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app- esp. the cool colors and quick-glance feature. I've  installed it on both my phone and kindy. I recommend it to everyone.
B00979CS50|5.0|I love Neil and Crazy Horse and I love the new CD. Saw them in Boston and it was amazing. Psycedelic Pill is a must have for any Neil Horse fan. They sound better than ever! Thank You Neil Young and Crazy Horse!
B001DCQI9G|5.0|Wonderfully conducted by Karajad and played by the Berlin Philharmonic, this CD helped be come back to one of the great composers of all time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't decide whether I like the book version or the movie version better, but I really enjoyed both.  I am very much looking forward to the next two books!
B007HC3LHS|1.0|I ordered this book (by mistake) on my Kindle. I'm compulsive about finishing any book that I start. I've been working on this one for one month. Oh! In the meantime I've started two new books and finished another. Perhaps, I may be avoiding finishing this book. It is very descriptive of horrendous physical abuse and degradation of the main female character. I found it doing switch backs from a previous time period. I don't like that because it can be difficult to follow. This character has OCD and the plot is constantly taking the reader on a sure excape from her tormentor to only have it fail, resulting in increasing violent deplorable acts to this women.
0790729628|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and have watched it twice. Each time I pick out some details that I missed before. If you like scfi you will enjoy Blade Runner.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Quick Read.  Suspensful. Very topical. Mitch Rapp, the hero, in this series has a narrow escape. Many unexpected plot twists and turns.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|A different setting than the other novels in the series, it isn't focused on war and fighting, but containing the same themes of mystery and suspense.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|This app does exactly what I need. Now I can give back my Grandson's Sleep Sheep which will activate for 45 min maximum and set this for 8 hours or whatever is needed.

B009GESJH2|1.0|Messy, il-planned and poorly executed--otherwise spot on-the rug.  The Kid must have finally sobered up and forget how to rock,  what a waste of time!

B004EPYZSU|4.0|I first saw this one on DVD rental and liked it so I decided to get myself the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack. A strange idea cowboys and Indians in a western fighting together instead of against each other but it looks good on screen.<br />I was never completely clear on what the aliens wanted with the gold (even making the effort to steal the handful that Daniel Craig's (James Bond in an American western(?) character had just stolen) or just why a Riverboat was found upside down 100's of miles from a river but for check your brain fun and good looking action- this movie has it.<br />For such an odd mix up of ideas this is not a bad movie, give it a try.
B000059H98|5.0|It is a freaky, artistic, punk cult classic! gotta love it. (not for the little kids tho... little too violent)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is a good game but after a while it will turn my screen black. I don't mind it but sometimes it gets annoying. but other than that its a great game.  :)
034580404X|5.0|HAVE HEARD ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THESE BOOKS. I DECIDED TO GET ALL 3 AT ONCE SO WHEN I FINISHED ONE I COULD GO TO THE NEXT.  AM WAITING TILL AFTER THE NEW YEAR TO START READING THESE
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I think I've got all three movies on VHS and DVD, decided to get them in Blu ray format for the higher quality image. It's been some time since I've seen any of the stories, #1 might be best, but the dinosaurs are still some of the best you'll see on screen.<br />If you liked the movies on tape or DVD, go ahead and get the Blu-ray- the improved image should be a real treat for you as will the new extras.
B008NW67E0|5.0|its a CD what more can I Say, nothing really too much about this scenario, more words required... Love Mumford
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app does exactly what it says it does. It does not attempt to be anything more than it should be. It lets you organize a bookshelf with precisely as many notebooks you want it to have, add pages if you need more space in them, and back them up if and when you want to. It is the closest one can get to a physical notebook on a droid device, and in behaving as such it fulfills its role unobtrusively and with a simplistic flair that makes it likely to become the only notebook app one will need on their device.
B009NCM248|5.0|Love love love this CD. Cannot stop listening to it. The incredible talent of Corey Taylor & Jim Root continually amazes me. I could listen to Taciturn and Tired on a loop all day. Highly recommend this CD !
B00942S4OY|5.0|For all the ire Simon Cowell trends to attracts, there is no doubt that, like the legendary Clive Davis, he has a remarkable eye for spotting talent.  Such is the case with One Direction, a five member boy band who became notable after appearing on the X Factor.  Like Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and Chris Daughtery, One Direction proves that such shows as the X Factor, The Voice, and the original American Idol can generate successful careers and genuinuinly exciting musical acts.  Apparently he issued a challenge to One Direction to make an even better album for their follow up to the 2011 \\"Up All Night\\".  Challenge accepted.<br /><br />Not only did the One Direction take up Simon's challenge, they bested their previous work, turning in some great songwriting that was conducive to both their preppy image and the fact there is no single dominant personality in the band (at least musically; who knows about behind the scenes).<br /><br />The five members of One Direction (Harry Styles, 18; Liam Payne, 19; Louis Tomlinson, 20; Niall Horan, 19; and Zayn Malik, 19) are all under the age of twenty one.  While firmly a \\"boy band\\", One Direction is one of those rare bands that will appeal both to adults and their children due to their expert songcraft and simply infectious musical instincts.<br /><br />Rather than reshuffle the deck, \\"Take Me Home\\" further refines the band's sound and simply expands on the already existing template.  When the foundation is this good, you should just build upon it.  One Direction works so well as a unit, and wisely the band chose material that allows them to show off their talents as a band persay, not just some individuals. Although multiple producers helmed the album, unlike so many other projects, the album does not feel disjointed due to differeing production styles.  Although I disagree, some reviewers complained about Alanis's 2012 album \\"Havoc and Bright Lights\\" suffering from having two different producers.  Fortunately, there should be so such concerns with \\"Take Me Home\\".<br /><br />For those who loved their debut, fans and new listeners alike will find much to love with \\"Take Me Home\\".  The band deftly plays electro-pop, acoustic ballads, uptempo, high octane poppy numbers with fantastic hooks, and stunning instrumentation.  The album deals a lot with young love, whether it's the Romeo and Juliet dynamic of \\"They Don't Know About Us\\", a boy and girl mutually abandoned by their partners at a school dance on \\"C'Mon, C'Mon\\" who find solace in one another, finding your \\"soul mate\\" in \\"Last First Kiss\\", or the Beach Boys style (complete with gorgeous harmonizing) \\"Summer Love\\" that ends the track.<br /><br />They even get into folky territory with an R&B vibe with \\"Little Things\\" and \\"Over Again\\", which lends an intimacy simply not found in the more straight up pop/top 40 material.  These two tracks show there is more to One Direction than just disposable hit singles soon forgotten.<br /><br />Although some may cringe at this so called musical heresy, \\"Take Me Home\\" reminds me of some of both The Beatles' and The Beach Boys' early material.  Let me explain what I mean by that before you raise your spears and pitchforks.  Like so many of the early Beatles and Beach Boys songs, One Direction firmly writes about teenage angst and joy and life experiences commonly associated with youth, and often their subject material is far removed from the day to day life of so many listeners who are past adolescence.  However, the songwriting is remarkable, there's an overwhelming sense of levity and fun, and even on the heartbreaking songs, you can't help but get caught up in the whole affair, even if you hadn't been to a high school dance for years.<br /><br />Where One Direction goes from here is anyone's guess.  For my money, One Direction is far more interesting than other bands of similar ilk (such as NSYNC and the Back Street Boys from the 1990s, and the Jonas Brothers and Justin Bieber which are closer in age to One Direction).  Whatever happens, their first two albums are simply fantastic, and both are among those rare LPs that break past the teenage demographic this type of music is aimed at and have far broader appeal.<br /><br />Bravo Simon!  You've bottled lightening yet again!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|it really really really helps you sleep I can also stop being afraid of the dark plus I just love the noise
B0060FXDCG|5.0|A very basic package of movies. An excellent dealt if you are just wanting to run through the stories with not a lot of extras and features.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Not at all a sign syfi fan and was leery when we husband (then boyfriend) gave me this book to read.  But now, this story is one of my top five reads.  This author, as well as most of his other books, are just wonderful.  Because of this story I am more openminded when it comes to science fiction.
B008ELUEQC|3.0|Christmas albums are generally hit or miss affairs. So many different artists have turned in these Christmas projects, with generally mixed results. So how does Rod Stewart's first Christmas album hold up?<br /><br />Fairly well, actually, as far as Christmas records go. As far as Rod Stewart albums, yet another cover record. For those looking for a rather inoffensive, by the numbers Christmas album, you would do well to purchase this record.<br /><br />First off, I've never been a huge Stewart fan - I know the radio hits and have heard a few of his albums here and there. For those fans of \\"Maggie May\\", look elsewhere. You won't find that Stewart on this record. He's been MIA for years.<br /><br />And for good reason. Since 2002, Rod Stewart has \\"reinvented\\" himself as a rather indistinguishable cocktail lounge singer, covering the \\"Great Song American Songbook\\", which as of 2012 there are five volumes and a live album.  Stewart has also recorded a soul/Motown cover album and a rock cover album, for a total of SEVEN cover albums since 2002.  Naturally, the rock cover album is the closest to the Rod of old.  For a decade, Stewart has been coasting.<br /><br />Although not officially part of the \\"American Songbook\\" series, \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" is very much an unofficial companion to that ongoing series. The music is mellow, never straying very far from the traditional arrangements we've all heard so many times over. There are the prerequisite duets - Mary J. Blidge joins Stewart on \\"We Three Kings\\" and C Low Green makes an appearance on \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\". Even a Disney song shows up (\\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\"). Unfortunately, so does Michael Buble on the rather dismal \\"Winter Wonderland\\". Sorry, just not a Buble fan. However, all sins involving Buble are completely absolved with the stunning duet with Ella Fitzgerald on \\"What Are You Doing on New Year's Eve\\". This track alone is worth the price of admission and is easily the highlight of the entire record.<br /><br />In context of Stewart's career, the \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" is rather troubling for those fans of his older work. Stewart is transforming himself more into someone who would appear on the Laurence Welk Show than the Ed Sullivan Show, and this trajectory apparently goes on unabated. With someone who has been around as long as Stewart, you do have to reinvent yourself and continually search.<br /><br />Johnny Cash with Rick Rubin launched his \\"American Recordings\\" series in 1994, with the last installment appearing in 2011, nine years after Cash's death. The concept of these albums is similar to the \\"Great American Songbook\\" - Johnny Cash becomes an interpreter of a vast array of American standards. While there were hits and misses on these albums, overall, the American Recordings work wonderfully well - mostly because Cash was always a fantastic interpreter of other people's work. Likewise, Dylan issued two cover albums of old folk standards in the early 1990s; I believe he used those two albums to get back in touch with his own type of songwriting, and has since gone on to release a series of his most artistically viable music since the 1960s (the rather saccharine, yet wholly charming, \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" not withstanding).<br /><br />Dylan played the 2009 \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" with a straight a poker face as one can imagine. At least the vast, sweeping disconnect from the guttural, throat-wrenching voice Dylan now has with the material he was singing (complete with backup choirs and corny Christmas arrangements) made for some (perhaps unintentional) rather comedic, yet oddly effective, listening. However, with \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\", Stewart simply sounds like the lounge singer you hear on cruise ships. What's troubling is this is same Stewart we've been hearing for the last ten years.<br /><br />Unlike Cash and Dylan, Stewart shows no signs of really reconnecting to his past to really make something worthwhile. The closest we get to the old Stewart is the closing \\"Auld Lange Syne\\", with its acoustic guitar playing really coming alive.<br /><br />Now, although this review has had a rather negative slant, that's only because I am discussing \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" in terms of Stewart's career. Stewart has always been a phenomenal singer. \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" is a good enough record for what it is - a slow, mellow Christmas record with a few upbeat tempo songs thrown in here and there.<br /><br />Of course, Christmas albums are often not indicative of what the artists are doing normally in their careers anyway, so they can get away with a lot more than they may try on a regular release. Sure, Dylan did \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" in 2009, but that record is an anomaly. But for those waiting for Stewart to come out with a strong album of original material like he did in his heyday or at least a cover album that is marginally interesting, don't count on it.<br /><br />It's Christmas - artists should have fun; just go in expecting these type of albums are more detours than anything. With Stewart though, this project is just another uninteresting, bland, predictable \\"American Songbook\\" album in all but name.<br /><br />I'd be far more enthusiastic about \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\" had Rod's last ten years been different, holding a similar view of this record like I do with \\"Christmas in the Heart\\" (a fun diversion from an interesting later day, long overdue renaissance, but a diversion nonetheless). For what it is (standard, mellow, Christmas music), Rod does well. Hence, I am rating this three stars.<br /><br />But for those waiting for Stewart to ditch the lounge act and issue some great music on par with his heyday material, keep waiting.<br /><br />[These are the seven cover albums preceding \\"Merry Christmas, Baby\\":  \\"[[ASIN:B00006JL4J It Had to Be You... The Great American Songbook]]\\" (2002), \\"[[ASIN:B0000C9ZEX As Time Goes By...The Great American Songbook: Volume II]]\\" (2003), \\"[[ASIN:B0002X94Y8 Stardust... The Great American Songbook, Vol. III]]\\" (2004), \\"[[ASIN:B000B7HZXM Thanks For The Memory...The Great American Songbook IV]]\\" (2005), \\"[[ASIN:B000HEVYR2 Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time]]\\" (2006), \\"[[ASIN:B002SXM0LO Soulbook]]\\"(2009), and \\"[[ASIN:B003X5F4R8 Fly Me To The Moon...The Great American Songbook Volume V]]\\" 2010.]
B004529NKC|5.0|If you like dancing movies this is one for you my sons also love it thats why im giving it 5 stars.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I took this ebook on a very long flight and found it so entertaining that i could not put it down.  It would make a terrific movie.  the characters are memorable and well drawn.  Anyone who has had to sit through those insufferable tort lawyer's ads can appreciate the author's insights into this world.  The ending may be a bit far fetched but hey this is fiction.
B004MMEF30|5.0|I read this book every fall.  Sherlock Holmes mystery at it's best!  I give this book 5 stars because it is well written, evokes incredible images of the English country side and has a bit of romance.  Written in the 1800's, this book transports me to another place and another time...every fall.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is a great Cd it has a lot of great songs and for the price you wont regret it.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Good movie my son loves it. So i'm going to give it 5 stars if you love movies where people are dancing all over the place then its a good movie for you.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|What more can I say it Abraham Lincoln and he a Vampire Hunter.<br /><br />Movie was pretty good it more of a rent then a buy in my eyes.
B000I186FW|1.0|I left. The main character making V's over and over crushed me. I know this is a weak review; I just had to put in my one star on this one. I only hate one other action movie this much, which was Face Off with Nicholas Cage. He kept saying \\"Face Off\\" to make sure you got it. V for Vendetta? Are you sure? I was thinking it was an S. V? Really?  Can you repeat that again?  It was painful.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|Again, as with the first, portions of this book are hard to get through. There's a lot of unnecessary writing, I skipped whole paragraphs, and did a lot of skimming. The ending, though, will push me to read the next book, just so I can find out how it all ends.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Classic and works very good to be free gave it 5 stars. Now I can calculate my customers purchases up w/out having to find the one my son plays with. Definitely a satisfied lady.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Was a great movie all I can say alot of action like how the movie turn out cant wait for part 2
B00973DDN2|4.0|For the price that I paid, it is a good album. I am going to see the Killers in December, and I thought it would be nice to have the album before I go to the show. I like &#34;Hot Fuss&#34; better.
B00526ZKYS|3.0|Honestly, I only bought the book because I realized the setting was the town I live in, Portland, Maine, and I was intrigued to read a book with landmarks and settings that I could actually picture accurately, that I pass by every day. Overall, the book was ok. Not great, but it did leave me intrigued by what will happen next. The ending does have a cliff hanger, and I am, at least, somewhat interested in the characters enough to find out where this story goes.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Great series that everyone should try to own. It was well packaged and arrived really really fast! definitely recommend this product.

I have stopped playing all but Star Wars because I was so irritated at having to always replay and attempt to win my three stars back over and over again.<br /><br />From a very loyal Rovio fan please do something about this issue it is irritating as well as disheartening to us to have to redo all of our progress for the second, third, and maybe even the fourth time.  Thank you!
B008Y5OW20|5.0|There's two things you can say about Jeff Lynne: 1. Unlike his contemporaries, the man's vocals are as solid and steady as ever; 2. He knows his audience. This album plays up the sweet and melodic hooks of these (somewhat) standards with an ELO-esque twist. It's a feel-good album that could double as a soundtrack for your sunniest day. A job well done.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Confirmed what I already believed  Anyone  would have a hell va  time,  Trying to explain it, But to make a believer outta a Doctor now  thats  good

B004AHNIGM|5.0|The selection and presentation of this album is outstanding! If you're a blues fan, this is one you need in your collection. I will admit I was hesitant to buy this album but I am so glad that I did. I have listened to it many times and enjoy it each time. Every track is a jewel!

1476719071|4.0|I wanted to read this book because I had heard it was going into production to become a movie.<br />I absolutely could not put this book down!! It is not your 'typical' love story.<br /><br />The relationship between Abby and Travis is filled with ups and downs throughout the book. Travis is trully a 'bad boy' in this story.....but there is nothing 'typical' about him. Tatoos, club fighting, and his string of one night stands makes Travis quite interesting to readers. Abby - on the other hand - is a straight-laced college student. She is the opposite of what Travis portrays. The two begin their 'relationship' on a bet.<br /><br />You will be taken into the a world of college life, underage drinking, illegal fight clubs, and an obsessive relationship. While some may find the unhealthy aspect of the romance between Travis and Abby as a reason to dislike the book.....I found myself really engrossed in the story.
