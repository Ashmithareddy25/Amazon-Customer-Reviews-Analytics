B001DJLCRC|4.0|Breaking Bad has a very unique story line.  Very unusual.  Bryan Cranston is great at portraying Walter White.  I understand that the series could not go on for much longer, but I will miss it.
0440244412|5.0|I love these books. I have read them a couple of different times and they were just as good the second time around as they were the first. I love the as you read through the books you seeing the characters develop as individuals and in their relationships. I was enthralled with these books and was unable to put them down. I recommend them to anyone and everyone.
B00DXP7L88|4.0|There were some surprises in this final season.  I wasn't completely pleased with how it ended.  I will miss this series.
B00F1W1SS0|3.0|Disclaimer: I'm not an audio engineer.<br />Admission: The mix is terrible.<br /><br />I'm not sure what else to say.<br /><br />For some context, I happened upon the Blu-Ray at a local HMV. I was excited to get home at watch it. Of course, it's always fun to watch DT rip through their repertoire, but I felt like whoever mixed this album has a love affair with guitarists. I didn't purchase the Blu-Ray (with full DTS surround sound to boot) to only hear Petrucci, as much as I love him. Rudess and Myung are completely lost in the mix. At first I thought I had blown a speaker or that something was wrong with my system, but after fiddling with the settings for about an hour, I just gave up.<br /><br />Also, the camera work had to be organized by someone who was high on a serious dose of caffeine. That's all I'll say.<br /><br />Negatives aside, I still had fun watching it (although I doubt it will ever get a second viewing in my house). And the best part for me was the documentary. I love getting a bit of an inside-view into the lives of great musicians like these.<br /><br />However, I do find it a bit strange that, out of 3 hours of content on a concert Blu-Ray, the most fulfilling segment wasn't even a portion of the live show.<br /><br />Major disappointment.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I like the love story &#34;out of sync&#34; concept. Sandra Bullock & Keanu Reeves made a moving and believable film, which I've enjoyed watching again & again. Love worth having will be there, if you feel it's right & you're willing to wait for it.
B0070Z97LG|3.0|great actors, but direction, editing, story kind of sucked. this is the movie when daniel craig met and fell in love with rachel w who became his wife so that is interesting. if you are a daniel craig fan, go ahead and rent it. i love him.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I read one chapter in divergent and was hooked instantly! Al the books are amazing. I cried reading this last book. I felt the pain and I felt like I was there! I wish it kept going! I will read this series over an over again!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This GAME is VERY ADDICTING :-)  You CAN'T get enough :-)  I enjoy it very much.  You should try it :-)
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I didn't like the writing.  For such a dramatic ending It lacked a compelling story line.  I was dissappointed in the poor character development.  Not a great final book.
6305263248|2.0|This movie sucks.  Not sure why everyone says it is thrilling and action-packed.  De Niro is the only thing that saved this movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Moving, gripping story.<br />A story that will stay with me for a long time.<br />Characters were nicely developed.<br />Would have enjoyed reading more in the epilogue.<br />Recommend for readers 15 and older.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a good read.  Unfortunately, I read the book after I saw the movie.  Two completely different stories that they almost seem totally apart, so don't worry about one ruining the other.  Take your time with this one and don't be afraid tore-read some parts.  Would definitely recommend.
B008602KQI|5.0|it was an awesome movie I loved every minute of it, the scenery was beautiful, can't wait for the secret to come out. a must have for any collection.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This legal thriller drew me in from the first page.  I have always liked Grisham, and was pleased to go back to the wonderful character from his first book, Jake Brigance, and the small town in Mississippi.  The story was intense and suspenseful, and the climax was electrifying.  An altogether enjoyable read.  Since the book was set in the 1980s we could hear much more about Mr. Brigance, and I, for one, would love that.
B00001OH7O|5.0|I had this on vinyl when I was younger and it got played to death and back.<br /><br />When I got a CD player I bought the disc but never got round to listening. One day I was sitting in front of the hi-fi with my two year old on my lap and I spotted it in the rack, still in its shrink-wrap. I decided to load it and listen to a couple of tracks with my daughter.<br /><br />What, 40-odd minutes later the disc unloaded and I realized that even though I had a then-complete collection of Bowie, this recording was the only one I truly loved. Every track is a gem. No filler. This is Bowie ascending the wave of his creativity, before he &#34;found his voice&#34; and &#34;took a direction&#34;.  Here Bowie has shrugged off the missteps of his very early catalog and built upon the solid foundation that produced &#34;In Memory of a Free Festival&#34; and &#34;Space Oddity&#34;.<br /><br />The ultra-famous tracks here are &#34;Queen Bitch&#34;, &#34;Changes&#34; and &#34;Life on Mars&#34;, risen to iconic status in western culture in the forty plus years that have come and gone since Hunky Dory was recorded, but every track on this album shines from the delightful &#34;Kooks&#34; to the lyrically bewildering &#34;Bewlay Brothers&#34;.<br /><br />Highly Recommended
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great movie.  Found a way to blend several Marvel Characters into one story line.  I'm sure there will be more combo movies.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|New Kindle Fire owners have all had the same experience. You pull up the built in dictionary and search on a word beginning with a letter somewhere in the back of the alphabet only to see the bewilderingly stupid search mechanism start searching *every word in the dictionary* for any occurrence of your word - even when it is embedded inside a larger word!<br /><br />Bloody useless! Only a computer geek could have imagined in their soda and chips addled brain that a so-called &#34;grep&#34; on the entire dictionary contents would be of the slightest use to anyone in the real world. Computer programmers have a saying &#34;you can't grep paper&#34;. Here you see the natural corollary: You can grep electronic dictionaries but you almost never ever ever want to do so because the results are about as useful as a ham sandwich at a Jewish wedding.<br /><br />So what do you do? You download this app, which will allow you to look up words the way a dictionary is designed for you to do so.<br /><br />It has all manner of other functions - word of the day and so forth, but the basic function is the one the Kindle owner will find most welcome.<br /><br />It's just a shame that the Kindle didn't have a native app for accessing the in-built dictionary like a human being would want to.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This all  is amazing it helps me get up quickly in the morning. It helps me stay on a good steady beat for the MORNING
B000000OMB|3.0|That's the best I can say about the stuff on this recording.<br /><br />It sounds like &#34;Fly From Here&#34; in places which makes me think that Downes is a bit of a one trick pony for a pop superstar. I'm sure that is a dreadful calumny, and you have to consider the source, but I understand after hearing this album why an embittered Jon Anderson felt that the then-new Yes recording (Fly From Here) was &#34;dated&#34;. He'd heard much the same sound almost three decades before.<br /><br />I'm catching up on groups I missed the first time around (I was a busy boy in the early 80s and spent all the time I wasn't drinking and wenching driving and working), but in Asia's case I'm beginning to suspect I didn't remember them due to hysterical amnesia brought on by stadium-power meh. I eventually left the UK partly to escape the godsawful radio pop of the day.<br /><br />Dear lord I hope Oasis are a better archeological find for me.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Wow,  I was blown away by this CD.  Old songs with her own style is amazing.  Sound quality is perfect.  I can't believe that voice comes out of her after years of watching her on Shameless.  Everybody I play it for loves it.  Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|The Adobe Reader restores all the missing functionality that makes a Kindle Fire owner gnash their teeth when using the native pdf reader - bookmarks, links and  proper document search.<br /><br />Unfortunately it comes with it's own raft of issues.<br /><br />First and foremost, it is very much slower when rendering than the native Kindle reader. This is somewhat expected of course, but even when the document does not have links, bookmarks etc in it the rendering is noticeable (and annoyingly) slower.<br /><br />Second, the way of opening documents is crocked. There is a tiny dropdown widget in the upper left corner of the home screen that produces a menu of possible sources. This is hard to activate in many situations. Worse still, it defaults to \\"recent\\" rather than the more obvious \\"documents\\". There is nothing I've found that enables one to change this wretched behavior.<br /><br />Trivial? Not really, when it results in one being already irritated *before* having to muster patience for each page to render (eventually). Yes I want to re-open documents occasionally, but I could find them just as well in the alphabetized list of \\"documents\\" and I *can't* retrieve a new document without faffing about in an increasing state of annoyance each time the wrong menu ('Recent\\") opens instead of dropping down the list of options.<br /><br />And even *more* annoying is the default \\"full page display\\" that makes pages shrink to teenytiny size if one swivels the Kindle to landscape orientation, requiring a pinch-zoom and glacial re-render in order to read the text. Compare with the native Kindle reader that uses \\"page width\\" as the landscape default display mode - *much* more useful.<br /><br />I'm afraid that while the Acrobat app does do away with \\"slide and guess\\" navigation it adds in so many problems it is actually quicker to use a paper copy than try and use a pdf for anything but page-by-page reading.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This is one of the all time great funny movies.  If you ever watch &#34;Star Trek&#34; you will love this.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Wonderful story of true friendship. Excellent drama and suspense. Beautiful word usage. A true classic, that everyone should read. I read it twice!
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Classically romantic. Kind of a Cindarella story: it's the sweet, pretty, careful sister that the captain of the ship falls in love with.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book.  I usually read fantasy or sci-fi, but thought I'd give this a whirl.<br /><br />There is definitely a point where you can guess the ending, but there are a lot of surprises along the way.  I didn't expect to get into this book and enjoy it because of how it was portrayed.  However, it really is a good read, and I would recommend it.
B00BEF1AEK|2.0|A fun physics game where you get to blow stuff up by hurling rocks at it. Sadly no method to quit the game is apparent. Hit back a bunch of times and the menu just pops up and away over and over. None of the options are quit.
0439023521|5.0|Only read this book because I got bored one night and saw the movie for free on Amazon Instant Video. Loved the movie so much I read the book. Read the book in one day, bought the other one at Wal Mart and read it in one day, now I am reading the third one. These books are so good that I didn't even buy them off Amazon like I normally do I had to get them right away at wal mart.
B000J670ZI|5.0|Hepburn and Grant are absolutely hilarious in this movie. That's what slapstick comedy should be. Funniest movie I have seen in a long time.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Interesting adaptation of the novel. I saw the movie first and then read the book. Really helps if you read the book first and then watch the movie. The director made this movie to really be a visually entertaining. Some people say his incorporation of rap and modern music into the movie really killed the 20's theme but he was trying to show that jazz music then is what rap music is today. Leo's fake posh accent was really annoying though.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|This album...oh man this album is just amazing from start to finish. Every song on ARTPOP is infectious and I find myself singing along and dancing around like a crazy person when I'm listening to it.
B00ESB6GBY|4.0|Funny show Neil Patrick herest is the king and Jason Segal are what makes this show so great boom layered!!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Engaging and well written, this book kept me captivated.  The author weaves together stories from different cultures and walks of life.  Interesting analysis of what would happen after a zombie plague too. Formats well on kindle.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing book told right about a true American warrior. This is an amazing story about a true American hero. From one combat veteran to another ... Thank you Adam Brown. I wish I would have had a chance to meet you and learn from you. You are an inspiration in life and death.
0316247545|3.0|While this book is quite nicely made, there's no real need to purchase unless you're a collector or die-hard fan. There is a lot of neat information (the design phases of Nightmare Moon, for instance), but there's simply not enough for the casual fan to bother with it. The episode summaries feel out of place and serve as nothing more than padding for the page numbers to make this &#34;guide&#34; feel far more impressive than it is.<br /><br />More behind-the-scenes information to even out the fact that roughly half of this book is simply recounting episodes would have made this purchase feel more justified.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I really liked this game because it wasn't so easy you could beat it in a day. Lots of seek and find and mini games. I'm not sure if I understand the ending of the story, but I still would recommend it to others. I also liked the extra game play chapters. Make more games like this, please.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like it....can get up to the minute weather, plus radar, which is important in Dallas.  Haven't played with it much, yet, but so far it's a great service.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|SF  November 14, 2013<br />Growing up as a child...........I loved this movie.<br />Its musical, funny, & I loved it........I remember the fantastic Judy Garland as a star always, & Margaret O Brien, another great child star to me.  Stars of yesterday and always loved them.<br />I wanted to share this beautiful movie of long ago...............and show my family the enjoyable of this, and not today.<br />These people made you want to go to the movies and just sit back and have some fun, too.<br />My children and grandchildren enjoyed it.................of cause we have enjoyed this every time we watch it.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Great movie. The story line was compelling and the characters were very well cast.  Yeah theres some drug use and lots of scenes of the main character drinking or drunk but its shows the struggle that real life addicts go through day to day.  If you're a fan of intense movie sequences and a gripping story line then I recommend that you watch this movie. Denzel is brilliant in it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A real &#34;Gone with the Wind&#34; style story.  Couldn't stop turning the pages. Stayed up most nights until 2:00 am to finish
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like Castleville Legends way better then regular Castleville. It is way easier to level up in, as you don't have to rely on a lot of neighbours level up all the time. I also love that I can play this on my Kindle :).
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Well written, very interesting story of a young man and his travels across the United States ending in Alaska.  Loved the book.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|It would be a major understatement to claim that Tomorrow’s Harvest was a highly anticipated release. It seems that ever since the group’s last record in 2005, The Campfire Headphase, the internet would light up with annual gossip of their return, the frenzy spreading fast and wide only to dead-end in another discredited rumor. So it’s no wonder that this time around, when Warp used the incredibly clever marketing campaign of embedding cryptic codes via six distinct entities (like BBC Radio 1, NPR and Adult Swim), I took some time in confirming the announcement’s authenticity. So what’s the big deal about Boards of Canada, and at what point did the Scottish electronic music duo reach this near cultish following? And why did I, along with so many, listened to the premiere of the album via YouTube and then immediately preordered both, the CD and vinyl?<br /><br />The word is that the two brothers, Mike Sandison and Marcus Eouin, began slowly working on their fourth studio album following the release of The Campfire Headphase. And if it took them almost eight years to produce the follow-up, then it was the eight years worth waiting for. There are many things I can say about the album, but it all boils down to this: Tomorrow’s Harvest is a classic Boards Of Canada album that only Boards Of Canada could make. Recorded at BoC’s own studio, called Hexagon Sun (located in south-west of Edinburgh, Scotland), the duo seemed interested in escaping the urban environment, preferring to work in isolation away from evolving genres and latest growing fads. This is perhaps why the sound of Tomorrow’s Harvest is so timeless, yet imprinted with that one specific point in time when Towism, Hi Scores and Boc Maxima used to dominate my playlists.<br /><br />“The challenge with this record was crafting the tunes into a specific style and time period we want to reference. [...] In this case there’s a deliberate VHS video-nasty element throughout the record and to get there it wasn’t just a case of processing sounds through old media, which is a given with us anyway, but we even went to the extent of timing changes in the music and the composition of the pieces, in really specific ways to give an impression of something familiar from soundtrack work that was around 30 years ago.” – Mike Sandison [1]<br /><br />The sound is full of lush, rich and deep ambient textures, stretching and warping through downtempo rhythms, like an old cassette tape left in a hot car over a weekend. There are plenty of vintage analog synth sounds and lo-fi treatments with even more subliminal messages and hypnotic layered patterns which immediately bring back the nostalgia of that dear ‘ol Boards of Canada. The title of the album, by the way, is inspired by Deadly Harvest, a 1977 film on widespread crop failures in North America, but that’s as close as the music comes to being post-apocalyptic. What’s even more explicit is the newly confirmed fact that those who’ve tried to replicate the BoC sound have definitely failed, as this imaginary soundtrack to the dusty documentary on ghostly cities is still the strength within their work. And that’s what the brothers have been working on all these years.<br /><br />There is a lot more that I could say about this record. But as with many critically acclaimed albums I often wonder if I should even bother. It’s not like I feel a responsibility of proclaiming my new discovery to the world and letting you know that this is an album you must own – I’m sure that you already do. It’s not like I must produce a counted amount of words to keep my day job as a critic – I’m sure I’d never write a word. I guess for me, this coverage is more like a statement of an acknowledgment, that yes, I’ve had incredibly high hopes for Boards of Canada, and yes, it certainly delivered! And after more than a dozen plays, here’s to many more rotations to come!ere it wasn’t just a case of processing sounds through old media, which is a given with us anyway, but we even went to the extent of timing changes in the music and the composition of the pieces, in really specific ways to give an impression of something familiar from soundtrack work that was around 30 years ago.” – Mike Sandison [1]<br /><br />The sound is full of lush, rich and deep ambient textures, stretching and warping through downtempo rhythms, like an old cassette tape left in a hot car over a weekend.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy the series.  Great characters and very interesting story line.  I have become a great fan of British television and the BBC series'
B008ZVJE3A|5.0|Sadly, there are only 5 stars--it deserves an 11.<br /><br />This is an important movie to gain cultural intelligence--make sure your college-bound student sees it.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I was having fun with challenges then noticed on more than one occasion that after getting every thing  I needed to complete as one thing that everything I collected disappeared and then my time to complete was to close to ending to start again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is over fun and entertaining, as well as slightly addicting, haha. It has a lot to do as well a  many different levels that it can be played at. Great game!!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Such a great short story, so inspiring and fun to read.  I read it all the way through in a matter of hours.
B003U6BE8I|4.0|I did not actually watch it myself, but it is a fantastic movie because my grandchildren have been begging to see it, and I was exhausted, so I succumbed to renting this video.  I had them watch it on a TV in my bedroom while I took a nap. I set them up with grape juice (watered down and with ice) and a bowl of popcorn, and I was able to rest through the whole movie with no fighting and no rough housing.  I thought it was a kid's movie, but when I awoke from my nap, my husband was there fixated on the movie and enjoyed it.  I gave it 4 stars because I didn't actually see it, but it is perfect for a grandmother needing a nap.
B004IQ78HA|5.0|Amazing interpretation of the Louis Carrol classic. It is true to Disney idiom without losing sense of the original. Quite a feat.<br />I especially love Twiddledum and Twiddledee and the entire army of cards!<br />My two year old loved it too and that's saying something!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Were are back in Ford county with Jake. Business is ok but not actually good when he gets a case that will flood his office with more work than he can handel. I had a hard time putting it down.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|lots of action, and fun to watch. story lines changed from the original series, but we don't really want a complete copy of the original. That would be boring.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Another engrossing season of Downton Abbey.  The Blu-ray is clear, great quality.  It is always a treat to watch the un-edited versions, which are longer and flow better than the PBS series.  My only complaint is with the menu.  It is SIGNIFICANTLY louder than the episodes.  The discs have the &#34;play-all&#34; feature which is wonderful.
B005PK56TA|4.0|addictive to say the least, wondering if there is a link between the seasons??? I know there are different stories between seasons but after watching season 1 and viewing this current season one wonders where they are going with this....
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It is rare that you find a sequel that lives up to the hype or expectations of its fans.  This movie does.  If you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise, then this movie is a &#34;must-have&#34; for your collection.  You do not have to be a &#34;trekkie&#34; to enjoy this action packed adventure.  Cumberbatch was a great addition to Star Trek's already fantastic cast.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Implausible. It appeared to be a spoof at time. Terrible casting outside of Channing Tatum. Terrible directing, editing and writing.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Powerful movie that gives glimpse into the events after President Lincoln's assassination.  The performances are outstanding.  While it is suppose to be a fair assessment, you see that things lean toward a certain opinion.  It in no way compromises the story, you will walk away satisfied.
B004D1GZ2E|5.0|Beautiful voice! I don't agree with having certain songs only available in certain countries only. It's too random and unfair. However I'm appreciative that I was bake to get this import.
B00G32OMF8|2.0|Movie was depressing. It only had a few moments of laughter. It was not what I expected. Did not like it.
0385528787|5.0|Margaret Atwood has the type of mind that sees beyond corners.  By the time I finished the trilogy, I was sad to say goodbye to the MaddAddamites and the Crakes and even the pagoons.
B003B02PFO|5.0|This book was a fun escape about the craziness that the Holidays can become.  After I first read it I was a little bummed about the ending, but after the second reading for my book club this year I didn't mind.  Quick read, lots of laughs.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The writing was superb throughout and Zusak ended the story well. I highly recommend it to others, especially in these times.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The original, and still the best! All these years later and it's still some of the best television ever made.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Super fun game easy to learn and play, the concept is cute, the characters sent scary church thuggish Tzu this
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Dear,<br />The CD arrived within the deadline and it is in excellent conditions.<br />This product is not available in Brazilian market and once again Amazon is the best choice.<br />Thank you very much!
B0006VIE4C|5.0|I loved this story about a farm boy with the help of an old man and a smuggler trying<br />to save a princess from the Empire.  I loved Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han<br />Solo, Chewbacca, and Obi-Wan 'Ben' Kenobi.  It was classic good and evil, David<br />and Goliath story line.  The few scenes added in the special edition were cool to see,<br />but it should not have been tinkered with too much.  One of the best!  Must watch.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A wonderful legal thriller;I really loved this book - One of Grisham's best.  It held my interest until the very end.
B00BCX2F66|4.0|I like the build and texture of this case. It is pretty nice. It also adds almost no bulk to your phone and is very aesthetically pleasing. However, I miss the magnets that keep it closed like similar cases for other products. The kickstand feature is pretty nice but it looks like it could create a crease down the middle of the back of the case where it bends. I have only had it a few days so it's still too early to tell. The last thing I like that separates it from a few other cases is the slots for the speakers on the front. This allows you to make calls with the case closed, which decreases the possibility of getting the screen dirty.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|I love this CD~! I discovered (haha pun intended) Daft Punk when I was in middle school, because their music videos played on Toonami. I really love this CD and I'm so glad that I finally own it! I should have purchased it a lonnnnggg time ago, haha.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A change of pace for Grisham, but I found it fascinating.  I can just see Mathew McGonnahey in a sequel as Jake again.  Well worth reading
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is an interesting show, and we look forward to the next episode. I hate having to wait for the next season.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this app I use it a lot and do a lot with it so  and I love how easy it is to use  and you get to decorate it how awsome is that
B005D9MUWY|3.0|This app seems to be more responsive than the pre-installed Swype on my Android phone. I don't like the fact that it seems to play in the background and keeps track of the corrections and predictions it has made. Especially since most of those tally up to incorrect predictions leading me to have to backspace and correct them. The app also does not like to complete a typed web address, as it jumps to insert a space and auto capitalize every time I enter a period. While in normal typing this is desired, I do not appreciate it in web addresses. There is no in between, you just have that feature on or off, it doesn't learn from your repeated corrections. I have noticed that any fields which require keyboard tend to hang a bit, sometimes alot, when tapped. This has become annoying. I really want to like this app, but I believe I will have to uninstall and look for another one to fill its shoes.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|*ALLEGIANT SPOILERS*<br /><br />this book was the worst. it wasn't written well, and she separated tris (cringes) and tobias a lot.<br />i can't handle the ending. DAVID KILLS TRIS EVERYBODY AND HER MOM CAME AND UGH it was soooo sad. if i ever met veronica, I'd ask why she killed tris.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I love the game and have played through the easy setting and am fast working my way through the medium setting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This version has cum a long way. I love it it makesme cum. Playing my 2nd favorite game on the go is amazing
B00E7SFAAG|3.0|I'm simply no good at platform games. She moves way too fast for me to push her in the right direction. Graphics are phenomenal. I just wish there was a slower pace setting for slow minded people like me.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|All you have to do is match three or more candy it is boring for me but maybe you would like it.
B008EL25LE|5.0|A bit more difficult than the first, which makes it a nice challenge. The games are progressively more difficult without being impossible to achieve.
B00FPH6A70|4.0|Very intriguing. Kept me on the edge of my seat. One of the best movies I've seen in years that isn't a remake of a remake
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Quick play. Took a few days, but easy to come back to when you have been interrupted by real life. Nice diversion when waiting in a Dr's office or for the train to come.
B009JZPH32|1.0|This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen. So long and drawn out about a pointless story line. IMO
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This app pulls your google calendar information into a simple, easy to read, 7 days on one page (screen size) image. That's it. Don't expect any more. You cannot edit it, or link through from it, but if you need to take a look at your week at a glance, this app will take care of that for you.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|I have been a big Lady Gaga fan from the beginning.  But this album ARTPOP really opens up questions about her talent and value system.  She connects with reputed schlock artist Jeff Koons and puts out an album equal to his garbage &#34;art&#34;.  Full blown hype for this album and little monsters wanting to be faithful to Lady Gaga endorse what is crap.  Applause is passable and Gypsy (which should be called Gypsy Life) is very good.  I bought Gypsy which was produced by Red One who did Poker Face and Bad Romance.  Why wouldn't she do the whole album with him?  ARTPOP is unlistenable crap.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Beautiful cinematography. A great story. Reached across three generations for our tv night.What more could one ask for for family movie night?
B00D2ZF3GQ|4.0|I don't know why people are complaining about this movie.  I really liked it a lot.  Yes, it is not a \\"typical\\" Will Smith movie.  Will played a very serious father and leader.  He had learned not to show fear in order to kill the Ursa's who only can smell pheromones and not see the person they are to fight.  The relationship between father and son was mostly a military type relationship, \\"yes sir!\\" and so on.  Because the the limited time the father had with his son, he had taught him what he felt he needed to survive in this world. And these things helped his son and himself work to survive their ship crash when there was no one to immediately help them.<br /><br />I thought the scenery and effects were beautiful and the writing was superb.  It was a DIFFERENT movie for Will Smith and he carried it off beautifully.  Jaden is a young man and he did an excellent job.  What do people expect of a young person?  He is learning and getting better all of the time.  This movie did NOT suffer due to Jaden's inexperience in acting.  What do you suppose a young person like that would do in the situation he found himself in?  He was training to be a Ranger but was not accepted yet.  This shows he had much to learn and he wouldn't be some experienced person before his time.<br /><br />I am glad I ordered this movie - it sounded intriguing and I LIKED IT!<br /><br />Here are some details about the Blu-ray / DVD / UV copy set:<br />Case shows \\"Blu-ray + DVD\\" only.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game. Engaging with beautiful graphics. Took me several days to get through the puzzle, and I look forward to more. Worked both on the original Kindle Fire and my Android phone.
0615633951|5.0|The concept behind this book and plush toy is simple and effective.  The Bee Good Fairy watches your child from its cozy little jar and when your child portrays good behavior the Bee Good Fairy flies away for a while, comes back and leaves a reward in your child's shoe.<br /><br />Of course, it is you who leaves the gift, so you decide what constitutes good behavior and you reinforce it when you see it.  It is a fun way to reward your child for being good as he or she develops positive character traits that will benefit them for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />While the cost of the book and toy may at first seem high, it isn't if you consider what you get.  The author took great steps to assure the book is of the highest quality and that the very cute plush toy in its plastic jar home are fun and safe. The combination of the two makes for a unique gift.<br /><br />The Bee Good Fairy arrives in the Spring and that's when the fun starts.  The author encourages you to take the Good Bee Fairy on car rides,  to the playground and even to the classroom, where good behaviors can be observed. While the Bee Good Fairy is away, children can use the jar to collect fireflies. All in all this is a fun and educational book for any family.  I look forward to my grandchildren's next visit so we can put the Bee Good Fairy to work!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Worst book I have ever read! Why would an author do this? Made me wish I had never read the other two. I won't be going to see the movie. I love the drama, action and heart wrenching moments, but please don't end it that way for crying out loud! Miserable.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I love the movie. The only problem was there was a moment while watching it seemed to get stuck while in the player. I'm hoping it was just a little dust on the disc that cause the problem.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Wow!!!  Rarely do I get to see a movie that has me guessing all the way through!  Complex and interesting.  Just writing this review makes me want to watch it again!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Another really good Alien movie. A lot of people were confused about parts of this film & I will admit I was also. I looked up the Directors vision and after understanding what he was trying to convey I enjoyed it even more. stunningly beautiful to watch.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Interesting and entertaining.  Not the movie of the year.. but pretty good.  Well worth the rental price.  You won't turn it off.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a CGI classic for the ages. The Hulk was my favorite character in this movie. Visually stunning to watch.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I don't remember anything about this movie!  I watched it a month or so ago... so that pretty much spells it out.
B005LAIH54|3.0|Not as good as the original but watchable I guess. Updated effects is what I believe gives this 3 stars.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A part of US history most people don't even know exists while the book is a work of fiction the Orphan train unfortunately is not. A sad but clear look at how things really happened as our young country grew.
B0087DFIYA|5.0|Another Mel Gibson classic.  &#34;Get That Clown&#34; Very funny line. Whatever you think of Gibson the man CAN ACT. Somewhat in the vein of Payback with a little humor.
B0002HZ70O|2.0|It didnt look like a quality built kit you would expect for the price. It was difficult to assemble, needed a lot of gluing and not much wow factor. I thought the Tamiya ones were much better.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of Snow White. I have seen many others. I thought the actors were good. The special effects were good too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|True to her first novel, Suzanne Collins continues to develop the characters of Katniss and Peeta as their life becomes even more unstable and uncertain. Both characters are suffering from PTSD and the uncertainty of their relationship with The Capitol isn’t helping matters. In true form, Peeta tries to downplay the deceit of the last games with his charm while Katniss desperately tries to keep up.<br /><br />Another staple of YA novels? A love triangle. Gale and Katniss have been close since they were kids. Had either of them never been called to go into the Games, they would have inevitably ended up together. But the trauma Katniss and Peeta experienced together along with the rouse of romance they put on for The Capitol, is bringing them closer and leaving Gale as a third wheel.<br /><br />This book definitely gets 5 stars from me and I recommend it to anyone who doesn’t want The Hunger Games to end with Katniss and Peeta’s first victory.
B0085A9J18|5.0|If I could give this film more stars I would. Best action film in years. If you are into action & do not see this you are NUTS.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has managed to bring the story of &#34;The Stand&#34; and &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; together so well, you would not think that so many years had passed between them.  He brings his character's to life and the story just flows so effortlessly.  It is well worth ready and adding to your library.  I couldn't put it down.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  Excellent book.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Grisham used to produce top quality stories, this is another of his latest cookie cutter books.  No movie from this weak sister, hard to believe he once wrote The Firm and the Pelican Brief.  A weak book from either a lazy or burnt out author.
B00GHJ6BJW|1.0|blah. Uninteresting rerash of 80s and 90s techno pop. Billy Idol did better with CyberPunk. I really wish this album was more engaging.
B008EZVNO0|3.0|This more or less tells me it is time for Van to retire. It's OK, but not really worth buying.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent up to date story line.  Denzel Washington is so good in everything.  Doubt that the upside down plane could really happen in real life though.
0062080237|5.0|My favorite novel. It's an epic road trip across America where the old gods fight the new gods. I read this book once By ear and I never get tired of it.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I have not missed a 007 movie since the 1st one in the 60s!  Of course, Connery was the best James Bond.  &#34;Skyfall&#34; song by Adele is a favorite.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Awesome book! Ending was not what I expected!! Don't start reading this book if you need to be doing other things because you won't be able to put it down!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I just really did not care for the story - suffered through it and didn't finish watching.  Just not my thing.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Giant robots punching giant monsters?  What could be better.  Release your inner 9 year old!  If you ever liked Godzilla, you will love it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Wasn't sure I was going to like this book but kept reading and found myself really liking it. I will definitely check out others she has written
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Best part was Bruce Willis firing a machine gun from the bed of a speeding pickup.  Nobody looks cooler doing that.  The chick was hot too.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|It started out better than it ended. It was an average story that was too predictable. It was simply lack luster.
B007K8ILUQ|3.0|The Blu-Ray copy was beautifully done, but as Kubrick's first film it does show his inexperience. Still, as a first film it holods up against other director's first efforts. The seller's requirements were 5 stars.
B00BTWCM9K|5.0|fun to watch them. Brings me back to the 80's.  Michael stillcan reach the high notes. I hope they will stay together this time
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted.  But I cant seem to download the updates. The 'download' screen just keeps going round and round till I have to cancel it.  Help
006202406X|1.0|SPOILERS!!!<br />Thank the lord I got so bored not even halfway into this book that I began to investigate all the negative reviews from Divergent's diehard fans. I'll be completely up front, I read to escape from the meaningless tragedy in the world, not to invest myself in something that will leave me wishing I would have spent my time doing ANYTHING else than to feel this betrayed, and what a betrayal it is.<br /><br />I LOVED Divergent and Insurgent. Yes, it wasn't Shakespeare, the books had their faults (frustrating lack of growth on Tris' part in Insurgent, a few inconsistencies with names and facts that had to be corrected in the latest editions, etc.), but I don't usually reread books and I must have read them both five or six times. I could imagine the whole premise, I even had certain actors in my head that would have killed (no pun intended) in the movie. I've been waiting eagerly for Allegiant to come out for over a year. And even though Veronica Roth has at times come across a little arrogant in interviews about her books and her talent, sometimes you gotta take the bad with the good.<br /><br />Except the hopeless, torpedo ending completely wiped out any of the good of her first books, because you can't read any of it anymore without the insides of your eyelids being bloodied by the eventual truth of the ending.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />First, although I did appreciate the fact that many of the chapters in this book were supposed to be given from Tobias' point of view in the beginning, there were waaaay too many times where I had to look back to check whose story I was reading because they had exactly the same voice. Second, what the hell premise is this genetic damage business? If you're going to spend one or two chapters on expanding this outer, ruling world, then get on with it. Don't spend endless chapters detailing this bland, pathetic place where life is even more desolate than before, they get to curse, and Roth gets to dangle the idea of futuristic gay relationships still hidden from reality. Where have the editors gone?<br /><br />I always loved the Tris/Tobias relationship. Of course I did, because that's how Roth developed the series. No matter their disagreements or deception, they were always both brave and selfless enough to support and push each other in the most critical moments despite being so young. Both COMPLETELY STALLED in this book. It's funny, because I always felt they acted almost too &#34;adult&#34; in the many emotional parts of the first two books. Allegiant made me want to smack my head against the wall after listening to one too many bickering exchanges between any number of characters, main and otherwise. Worse still, Tris becomes a condescending tough b%$ch girlfriend and Tobias a puttering, helpless sack of emasculated dryer lint as they volley back and forth with rebellion, after rebellion, after rebellion.<br /><br />Still, they've never suffered in the physical chemistry department, so despite their ridiculous banter here, there, and everywhere, at least they finally get some in this book, chaste metaphors and all. Redemption? Nah.<br /><br />Roth basically wraps up this hot mess of a conflict after two books' worth of warring factions, maniacal political leaders, spousal/child abuse, death serums, mass murder, etc. with a couple of dull chapters where everyone just shrugs their shoulders and go &#34;hey, yeah, makes sense, you take over, cool.&#34;<br /><br />No people, I understand, people die. Parents, little children, innocents everywhere. The Hunger Games, Harry Potter, yes, yes, it happens. But there was at least method even in that madness. Purpose. But such notable characters die such ridiculous, almost indifferent deaths in this book...not even TOUCHING the GIANT, WORTHLESS event of Tris' demise. Everyone great dies (except Tobias and Christina). Everyone deplorable lives on happily without a real clue of their deeds (Evelyn, Peter, Caleb, David) or disappears without a trace (Marcus, Nita, various vapid and corrupted psychopaths, etc.). I was willing to accept the lame and lacking character development, the pointless outer world, at least for SOME redeeming end story. Readers, what Roth is basically saying is, &#34;I know you've all supported me, showered me with fame and praise and millions despite myself, but here's my giant middle finger, so suck on it because I'm going for the SHOCK VALUE.&#34;<br /><br />Lionsgate has said that &#34;there's no such thing as bad publicity&#34; and &#34;the ending won't affect the film series&#34;, but this movie will have to be SO amazing that us damaged readers will be forced to crawl back into this ruined relationship totally lacking in judgement just to be flogged once more not on the page, but in hi-def, IMAX, 3-D.<br /><br />Don't spend another dime or second of your time here people. The first book will act as a doorstop in a dank basement, the second wedged underneath the broken headboard in the guest bedroom to prevent needless squeaking, and the third I will donate as kindling to a homeless shelter's burn barrel.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The writing is amazing. You can not only see the scene laid out before you. You can smell, taste and hear the world Rothfuss has created. The best book series I have ever read.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Action packed.  Incredible graphics...on the edge of your seat action!  I love Sci-Fi and this fit the bill for sure
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game has been out for a while now, and it is probably one of the best games out there. Very challenging, you always want more, and by getting to the next level you get exactly that. Way to go with this game....
B00942Y35S|5.0|Inspiring story.  It isn't what you look like, but what you are inside that brings for the beauty of who you are.  Great life lesson!
B009ZQFSRA|2.0|Implausible story line with gaping holes in every scene. Only cameo appearances by Emily Watson (as if I cared, but to tout an actress that is in less than five minutes of film seems dishonest).
B00B5C0YOO|4.0|I had been looking for an app that backs up previous versions.  I had an app that I didn't like the changes and i was unable to go back to a previous version. Now I can have app backups to roll back to if the situation happens again
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I'll be buying every season on dvd or bluray. This show is beyond awesome. If you want more than George Romero's endless zombies eating people, here's a great show. Yes there's some zombies munching on people, but it's the backdrop to a more serious look at humanity and what becomes of us all when the world as we know it dies.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I enjoyed this book up until the tragedy. I know that the author doesn't owe the reader anything and it is her story to tell, but really?  I was first annoyed that it went back and forth from Tris and Tobias' point of views, but it had to be this way with so much going on. Definitely not as good as Divergent or Insurgent... Somewhat of a let down.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Greatest show on tv ever! Story is always captivating, characters are diverse and interesting, and seriously, who doesn't love zombies??
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Fun movie. We enjoy Jeff Bridges. I especially liked the shift in perspective from what others saw to what was &#34;real&#34;.  Seemed like a good series pilot.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Top notch show! So addictive and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Carrie Matheson is wreckless, impulsive, and will drive you crazy all the while making you desperately wanting to see her move forward. Life is not black and white. Homeland lives in the grey making it psychologically thrilling and always leaving you wanting more.
B007C1119O|5.0|Lark Rise to Candelford is beautifully filmed with true-to-life acting and wonderful story lines. I would happily suggest this to my friends<br />.
B001MM28JG|4.0|Fun! Perfect for anyone who loved Star Trek and all that -- and has a sense of humor about it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I read this book years ago and enjoyed it then, and after reading it for the second time I found I enjoyed it even more.  Follett is an excellent writer, I find myself totally engrossed in his story lines.  Eye of The Needle is an exciting, fast moving spy thriller and I highly recommend it, even for those who have read it years ago.
B002WN35DC|5.0|Un libro genial, que aunque parece escrito para ni&ntilde;os, realmente es como adulto que puedes disfrutarlo m&aacute;s. Es lectura obligada
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Just a really big disappointment. It's almost as if Veronica Roth got bored and threw something together to end it while trying not to be like everyone else. I don't know. The ending just really pissed me off.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|So good . The unmatched energy and chemistry is exposed on this CD. All the  7 hour days playing at the Cavern Club show that hard work pays off .  Probably one of the greatest live acts of all time besides being the best creative  band  ever.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A beautifully written, thought provoking, tear jerker of a book. I couldn't put it down. Terrific read start to finish
B008JFUNJQ|4.0|First thing, I read this book a few times over the years. It's a great book and once you strat, its one of those books thats hard to put down.<br /><br />2nd If you have not read the book, like some people I know. They really enjoy the movie enough. But personlly not in depths. Movie is very fast pace, easy enough to follow and again enjoy.<br /><br />3rd I only games this a 4 star. Movie should have been broken up into two movies or at longer time. We all know that no movie and book go long like two peas in a pod... Sad to say but true. I enjoy reading books that catches my mind but sadly depress from movie productioners make movies base from books but with lots of changes. For whatever reasons. Mostly money reasons. (my thoughts). The movie is just fast pace. It really leaves a lot to say about. Still, I get credit to the actors for playing there parts and rolls. Thank you!<br /><br />My last thoughts: I swear in back of my mind that this is the second movie of Enders game. I remmber reading this book in school english class 4th grade. After book was done. We watch the movie. Movie was like late 70s early 80s style. Actor was english.... Like I said, in back of my mind...
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A real page-turner! I could hardly put the book down. The characters were well-written and defined. True reflection of the culture of the south at that time.
B00846REIS|5.0|Great book.  I enjoyed the whole series and cannot wait for the 4th book.  I have never read any books from Sylvia Day but I will now.
B004P7CMUU|3.0|Two of the best actors in the world, great director, great soundtrack, but it didn't hold my attention.  I'll watch it again soon. Perhaps I'll feel differently about it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was so captivated by this book that I read it in less than a day. Can't wait to begin book three, and yet saddened at the same time knowing it will be the end.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book broke my heart. I don't want to give away any spoilers since it is still such a new release, but it was upsetting enough that I wouldn't even recommend the first two books of her series anymore.<br /><br />Firstly, I felt like the big twist on what Chicago and the factions were was just a slap in the face and lacked creativity. She also threw in a bunch of new characters Stephanie Meyer-style which was irritating.<br /><br />Secondly, the entire book became a thinly veiled allegory on equal rights, which fine, I support equal rights 100%, but why did this suddenly become about that.<br /><br />Thirdly, in a young adult fiction novel, the heroine should be able to have her happy ending - even if it is bittersweet ala' Suzanne Collins' Mockingjay or J.K. Rowling's Deathly Hallows - there was still an uplifting, hopeful end. Yes, you cried and grieved, but they both made the losses feel OK in the end. I feel like Roth just disregarded her fans and their love of the many characters and threw a Hail Mary to try and be shocking.<br /><br />She did shock me, made me angry, deeply disappointed me and I will probably never read anything she writes again.
B001P06GX4|5.0|The is a great game for our family. We play quite a few board games, and I like this one a lot. Our grandsons (7, 5, 2) play very well and the 2 year old can enjoy it. Highly recommended.
B00BSB2AE4|1.0|The worse book I have ever read. And I do this knowing she suffers from depression. Sorry. Stick to blogging
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan writes really well and researches in detail. Some of the detail is a tad heavy going but this book gave me such an education, particularly on the subjects of fermenting and microbial DNA!<br />A good read for anyone who loves good food and has an interest in nutrition.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Didn't love it I have to say. Struggled to get through it. There were a lot of plot holes where I was like okay I guess that works...whatever.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just LOVE this series!!!  Wasn't able to see the third season...but with Amazon Prime...Whalla!  I was able to stream it in HD for FREE!
B00AU9EKJS|3.0|This is a review of the AUDIOBOOK version of this work.<br /><br />If the narrator were anyone other than the author, and a best-selling author at that, this narration would be considered sub-standard. The author employs a limited range of vocal qualities, which fails to add much, if any, emotion or characterization to these short stories. The tone tends to sound mostly cynical and/or tired. This recording is simply a reading, and in no way is it a performance.<br /><br />The stories themselves are creative, but only one is edgy in any way.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I wish you could rate 1.000.000 stars. This game is so fun but hopefully things could take less time to breed but still this is a great game.
B0089LOG02|5.0|An interesting part of US history that not much is written about.  The author was quite skilled in the way she presented the story showing the way children were viewed then and now.  I am glad that I knew from the beginning that there was a happy ending or I don't think I could have continued reading how the orphans were treated.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|O my goodness... how long have we waited?  YES!  Crank it up.  Paint the town yellow and black.  No more hell to pay baby.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I accidentally broken three glasses while reacting to this book. why veronica roth why would you do this to us
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It works and it is easy. I was able to get it to run without any difficulty. It also has a way of regulating how bright you want it.
159514188X|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing!  I read it in literally 24 hours (between work, school, kids, social activities, etc).  It is easy to read so I can see how it is on the top 10 list for pivotal books for teenagers.  This book does not dwell on the &#34;suicide&#34; itself but how everyone's actions and spreading of rumors and bullying can affect other people and the importance of trust and hope and friendships.  Highly recommend for any parent to read and to gift to their teenage children.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|No spoilers here, Just going to say....if you are a fan of Pendergast, read this book! Quickly, before anyone else spoils it for you!
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Stryper has never failed to disappoint this Stryper fan with their latest musical offering No More Hell To Pay. Excellent Job. But; I do have to make a confession that the band members in Stryper might find either humorous or not... when Stryper was set to play at Devos Hall along with special guest artist Hurricane back on March 04, 1987... I had already bought the concert ticket here in Muskegon, Michigan at Believe In Music on Apple Avenue...I was working for Goodwill Industries for the Janitorial Crew and did not have enough time built up to take time off to go to the concert...so; I justified it by calling into work and telling my supervisor that I had the flu bug...kind of back-fired on me though.. did not get sick pay either...but I had a great time seeing Stryper. The second time I seen Stryper was on October 25, 1988 { In God We Trust Tour } along with White Lion at the L.C. Walker Arena in Muskegon, Michigan and by then I had enough time on the job built up; that I could take a personal day off and be able not to lie where I was going. I would like Stryper to come back to Muskegon, Michigan if it is possible.<br /><br />Sincerley;<br /><br />Timothy Allen Monroe
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Great album from start to finish.  I love almost every song!  Tracks to check out include Aura, G.U.Y., Manicure, Swine, and Mary Jane Holland!
B008ADUHKW|2.0|I just don't get it. I find these stories ordinary and written in an emotionless voice - I feel the same about Atwood so I guess I have a problem with the greats of Canadian literature.
B001BANK32|3.0|Sometimes it seems like the idea of a story is so scary, you can't even consider reading it. It builds up this fear, then one day you decide to chuck the fear and read it.<br /><br />That's how this was for me. The idea of it was so scary. The movie, the story, the tales told by others. \\"That movie is so scary, you'll have nightmares.\\"<br /><br />Now I've read it. It was creepy, sometimes a tad unsettling, but I won't be having any nightmares. I think it is time to watch the movie!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|THis is essentially Kerbin Space for the mobile device. It is fun, yet has a strong and enduring replay value. The developer continues to support the program with regular updates.
B004EF65QA|3.0|I think the story line is interesting. Before this I had not known that North and South of England had very different perceptions of each other around the time the Industrial Revolution turned some urban centers in the North into some sort of factory as opposed to the more genteel and rural South. Maybe? I tended to think of England as England. So I got educated, I guess. Other than Daniella Denby-Ashe's acting the others were pretty so so. Maybe it's 3.5 stars but not a 4. IMO.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is an awesome book. It was very well written and brought out empathetic feelings towards Vivian and Molly and their paths in life.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game.  Easy to play and simple instructions.  A fun way to relax!  I would recommend this to everyone.  Oh and it is free a nd that makes it even better.  :)
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|OMG!  This movie was adorable!  I could watch it 100 times :)  I watched this with my BF and he enjoyed it too.  A must for the Halloween season!
B00BU8QOII|5.0|instantly soared to the top of my list. Extremly well done, great movie that really makes you feel and sucks you in.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I chose this rating because I really enjoyed the series, it kept my interest and waiting for Season 4.  I loved it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Good but it could really do with mobile chrome browser support. Why Google haven't sorted this out yet is beyond me?
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Hey gals, looking for some fluff reading, here's your series. There are several books in the series, YA. Let me know if you are reading these books.
B004XZR63M|4.0|Great Book. Robert does not get carried away with analyzing any part of his plan, but he does present an interesting way of relearning to live one's financial life.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Short story but perfect for a little baby. I wanted to start reading for my baby and this was perfect
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Row did not disappoint. As soon as I started reading it I was immediately transformed back in time with Jake, Harry Rex, Lucian and Ozzie. I could not put it down until I finished it!
B000FC1MM8|3.0|Not my favorite Harry Bosch novel. It was good, but not great. The Bosch series definately gets better with each one.
B005U9RE1Y|5.0|A cult classic.  Bowie OWNS it as the Goblin King. The magic of Jim Henson married with the mystery and genius of Bowie is the perfect combo to make this film a wonderful romp.  It just never gets old!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I use Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and this is an awesome product for what I use it for.  It's comfortable to use and VERY easy to program and make changes to your profile on the fly.<br /><br />The only con I would say is this.  Sometimes the device's default logo loads on the screen when I boot up instead of the profiles.  I think it's because it isn't being recognized by Windows 7.  The solution that I found is that you go into the task manager and close all the programs running for the G13 and then I run the executable.  After this it boots up and works.
B000002U88|5.0|Classic Bob Seger tunes!  One of his best albums.  Not sure why Even Now didn't make the Best of CDs...should be on the list along with Roll Me Away.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|AMAZING & WONDERFUL & FANTASTIC & FABULOUS & EXQUISITE & EMOTION & HAPPINESS & SADNESS & EVERY GOOD THING !!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations I'm 12 and I would recommend this to everyone who has a Percy Jackson addiction
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad Candy Crush is finally available for the Kindle Fire! I just purchased it 2 days ago, but so far I haven't had any trouble with it. The only downside to this game is that it is so addicting! I'm glad you only get so many lives at a time or I wouldn't get anything else done!
B00ER23V1W|1.0|I can only assume that the buyers of this product have managed to divorce the score of the film from the film itself as watching the film I can only remember wishing with all my heart that someone would turn off the racket and we could experience the blessed silence that the patronising title sequence had promised us occurs only in space. Like the rest of the movie the Muzak was bad / probably the worse thing about the whole film. It makes me laugh that people have bought the album!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|David Eggers' latest is certainly no piece of &#34;literary&#34; fiction, but interesting enough on the dour ramifications of our &#34;always connected&#34; civilization.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|the book was great i could not put it down.<br />i became attached to the people in the book<br />i did not want the book to end
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The first book in the series was really good but each successive book became repetitive and even boring at times. None of the books could stand alone. They are continuations that could not be read without reading the previous book. One well-edited book would have been sufficient to tell the whole story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Grandchild loves these game, they actually help the youngest with hand and eye coordination. Earn Points, Fun and Great little game, great for car rides!!!
143911000X|5.0|Received in timely fashion and gave a copy to a couple of my bros. Thanks very much! It's good for some laughs- that's for sure!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addicting, frustrating, fun, aggravating, gotta watch the time or game can be all consuming.  Fun for ALL ages! ! !
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|So profound. I .will never look at Nature or civilization again the same. I will take my insights to all that I can. Worth the time and money.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Grandchild loves these game, they actually help the youngest with hand and eye coordination. Earn Points, Fun and Great little game, great for car rides!!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books of this series, but I hated this one.  The ending was horrible and useless.
B008K9UZY4|3.0|Grandchild love this game, I was not really impressed with it but then again I am not 6 and 9. a bit difficult for 8 and under.
B00992CF6W|5.0|good, has good features that appear in pc version. fun app can't wait for online servers to come out! keep up the good work!

B005DF2QMC|4.0|Really nice, when i bought it i thought it wouldn't work, but its working just find. The only thing i don't like is that it needs battery's.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Grandchild loves these game, they actually help the youngest with hand and eye coordination. Earn Points, Fun and Great little game, great for car rides!!!
0061733199|5.0|If your looking for a real survival book this is it. With the tatics and tips in this book , I feel like i am prepared to really live off the land. From basic shelter building and what plants are edible to what type of fire for cooking, boiling,smoking meats. This book has it all.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Grandchild loves these game, they actually help the youngest with hand and eye coordination. Earn Points, Fun and Great little game, great for car rides!!!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to an person that is a 1960s to 1990s junkie to read this book because it has tons of references to back then plus it's good for modern kids because it takes place in the future.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Grandchild loves these game, they actually help the youngest with hand and eye coordination. Earn Points, Fun and Great little game, great for car rides!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|This was an exciting movie.  A good adaptation of the book.  Costumes were excellent.  We are looking forward to seeing the sequel.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|saw this recently on a ship and it reminded me of seeing it ten years before, i'm not sure Wellesley is as it's portrayed even then but there are star turns from the supporting cast particularly DC's Marcia Gay Harden as a clingy etiquette teacher. I think Julia R may have earned her 25 million for this flick but for my money, i can't keep my eyes off Maggie Gyllenhaal as every mother's nightmare.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This is not your typical urban fantasy book, which is what I was expecting. This is a richly woven and complex story involving a variety of creatures - witches, vampires, demons -- and their politics. Throw in some time traveling and wonderful storytelling and it is reminiscent of Diana Gabaldon, but deeper and somehow darker. Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B00CL8D83U|2.0|definitely not their best work as Thursday seems the only memorable cut and even that, about as memorable as a Thursday, i think they've come to the conclusion they can put anything out and it's like ten years ago with &#34;I'm with Stupid,&#34; a cult classic, maybe not?
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|I read the synopsis of this book and was psyched about reading it.  Unfortunately, as I tried to do so, I found it to be one of the most boring and predictable books I read recently.  The characters were not engaging to me as a reader, and the plot just seemed to meander aimlessly for what seemed forever.
B007OAAK0O|3.0|funny how memory plays tricks on you so many years later, i remember this differently, with Miss Ross fighting with city officials to stay on stage in the rain, of her pulling a muscle dude on stage for the Michael Jackson penned &#34;Muscles&#34; and generally of her working her way into diva immortality, well, that part was totally true, no one thought of her the same after this. I think, however, it didn't age as well as she did, as it seems dated and maybe just as well, as time yields for no man, not even Miss Ross herself.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|This album is just amazing.  Gaga has outdone herself on this album.  Her voice is so powerful and amazing.  I would recommend that everyone should buy this album.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|thought it was the perfect gift for someone older or contemplating next move in life, it didn't lose much on a small screen like some movies do and it was good to have the project in hand for viewing whenever &#34;one&#34; wanted. I thought it was a good purchase.
B0091VYG86|5.0|It was pleasant to watch it, but I gave it 5 star just because I want u to see for you own how they make it seem that sinners are ok to be, one spoiled girl changed all. Oh wow!!
B00ET3VHZG|1.0|I downloaded this app. and as soon as I started to play I noticed that it was hard moving pieces, then my Kindle HD just cut off. When I restarted it  worked for a few seconds then cut off again, then I noticed that my device was getting really hot on the right side, that's when I deleted the app from my system. Would not recommend to anyone. Decided to continue to use my pc  for now until I can find one that will play on my kindle.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Great book, I read it on my week off in a couple of days throughly enjoyed it, will be looking to get more of her books.
B005PK1G76|5.0|It's less than $10. It's strong and hold different sizes of cups. Excellent value if compare with other major brand that may cost 2X more.
B00D2ZF24O|3.0|There is no Sci-fi storyline. It is nothing but a scared kid encountering one deadly scary creature after another. There is no story except the kid trying to prove to his overbearing militaristic father; he is not a coward. It is all based on his fathers failure to give him assurance & parental support. The kid has a permanent whiny expression & tone throughout the entire movie. This kid constantly whines about everything.<br /><br />I liked many of M Night's earlier movies. But remember Swartzenegger's &#34;Last Action Hero?&#34; You can't have a major star on the sidelines of a kid actor in any movie. It would go bad regardless of the theme & the kid ends up the target of the audience's anger at being cheated from seeing the star in action.<br /><br />Even when things are going good, Jaden is whining & wearing that crybaby expression until the very end. It seems to be the only expression he knows. I'll bet he also has it at home. He needs to find some non confrontational career but nothing with Customer support or critical systems where he would be under pressure. This kid cannot withstand pressure. Perhaps a job at HP or working on camera crews. But he does not have the Stamina or personality to be an actor. He may be able to act but he won't survive the politics of Hollywood without a driving personality. The parents need to back off the pressure on this kid. He can't take it. They might drive him to drugs if they don't back off. He doesn't have the stamina for acting. Fathers are very bad about overdriving sons. They should just provide positive support on what he is good at & stop pushing him to compete with his dad. This is a common problem with children of parents who are larger than life in their careers. Take it from our experience. He doesn't have his father's drive or capability IRL & it will end up badly if pushed.<br /><br />As for the lack of storyline, I really get tired of sci-fi movies with nothing but battles or scary creatures or aliens. I want a story with what events happened to cause those conditions; discoveries of ruins & survivors (not living in some dark caves) using ingenuity to survive in uplifting stories without constant creatures.<br /><br />Remember &#34;Robinson Crusoe on Mars?&#34; Despite the dumb title, it was very engrossing as to how he learned to overcome obstacles to survive. Remember the clues & final revelation of the original Planet of the Apes? That was sci-fi at its best.<br /><br />Stories about discovering a surviving underground society on Mars would also be a good story as long as someone doesn't turn it into a creature battle or Warring civilizations or vicious prometheus aliens or some sick irradiated society like they created on Beneath Planet of the Apes & Battle for&#34;.<br /><br />A deep thinking story on survival & society working together and positive alien societies would be nice. I'm sick of the violence with no story. I'm sick of violence & gore period. Also sick of dark, dank, grungy sets.<br /><br />&#34;Oblivion&#34; was a nice clean, technology sci-fi with a great storyline for a change. So was &#34;Moon&#34; although the deterioration of Sam was too gross & graphic. But otherwise a great change of pace. Go for uplifting or surprising stories of integrity & technology & survival without the other crap.story with what events happened to cause those conditions; discoveries of ruins & survivors (not living in some dark caves) using ingenuity to survive in uplifting stories without constant creatures.<br /><br />Remember &#34;Robinson Crusoe on Mars?&#34; Despite the dumb title, it was very engrossing as to how he learned to overcome obstacles to survive.

B0088W6LAK|5.0|Best show created!!!<br />This show was one of the best Sci-Fi shows around back then and probably the best ever.
B007V4LBLU|5.0|Great film.  Everyone went on to have a very successful career.  Original, funny, captivating, well developed characters. A must see.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Not sure if it is the age of the movie but the plot is a bit boring. The acting of some of the principals could have been better.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|It would have been a five star except for the length. Love Russell Crowe, loved the story. An interesting take on Robin Hood. Needed some cutting room work however.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It kept me on the edge of my seat. One of the best books I've ever read.  Great characters; Jake was a man I'd love to get to know.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Fun, Fast,  &amp; challenging game. Great for increasing your motor &amp; memory skills. multiple levels help test your capacity to learn more and at a faster pace . Great brain game.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book was about how the past plays a roll in your decisions about your future.  Emotional, romantic and a heartbreaker, are all words to describe this book
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This is a great show. Where they come up with these supernatural characters is hard to believe. The stars are great actors. This is a very entertaining show to watch. Even more enjoyable with out commercials.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I liked the app. It is simple and fun to use right before hunting season. This way I can hunt year round.
0316322407|5.0|This contained a lot more history then I thought was in it. But a good read. She is a remarkable young lady. God Bless her.
B0091THRCU|3.0|I enjoyed this case at first because it allowed me to protect my iPhone 5 while still enjoying its reduced thickness and its lightness while out of the case.  However, I eventually tired of having to take it out of the case every time I wanted to use the phone.  Also, I must've gotten a particle of some kind in the case at some point and now I have a streak on the front and back of my phone that I don't care for and that I can't really remove completely.
B001JRB16U|5.0|What's not to love. It's the original movie.  My girls watch it all the time.<br />I recommend for anyone who loves the classics.
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|This was the best movie I have scene since transformers 3.  This was a very action pack movie, and it was very emotional as well.  Often superman/Clark Kent is viewed as the all American golden boy, who had it easy especially when compared to many other superhero' s lives, not true. In this version of the story Clark suffers from being bullied as he is growing up and from being different, the biggest difference is the people closest to Clark are fully aware of everything he is going through and they are there fully supporting him and giving him what he needs emotionally to be healthy.  I loved Henry Cavill in the role of superman.  I loved the fact that he made superman more emotional just buy the expressive looks on his face, he was perfect in the role, dare I say it Henry was a better superman, than our much loved Christopher  reeve' s.  Another thing that made me love the movie was the fact that they smartened the character Lois lane up, remember when Clark Kent removed his glasses and ever a led himself to be both Clark Kent and superman in the 70's version with reeve's, well that scene used to tick me off, cause after all she was in loved with superman and she worked with Kent everyday, how could she not know, that's crazy. In this version Lois knew exactly who he was from the get go, and to me it improved the movie by leaps and bounds. What also improved the movie is the fact that this Loislain is more likeable because she isn't the annoying know it all like past Lois lanes.  We also got to see what motivated the villains in t his movie which is something we didn't get to see with the original General zod.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|It captures everything I loved about Superman from the comic books.  The movie shows the raw side of the hero.  It shows the struggle and the eventual realization of what he is destined to do on Earth.<br /><br />It is often thought that his character is perfectly clean cut in every way.  This movie gets back to the roots of the comic book story and shows the gritty, blunt force drama that goes with becoming and being the Man of Steel.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|it was good to read a story about a real American hero from this book you could tell he was a great man
B00FPH6M82|3.0|Only an average movie. Interesting concept and plot but doesn't develop into it's full potential. Jaden's character seems too young for the role.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Lone survivor is one of the most mind grabbing sagas of American patriotism and determination that I have ever read. This is a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone who wants to know more about the fighting spirit of our American heros in combat
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This is a great film! Love it, I only gave it 4 stars because the Blu Ray is a bit grainy and the actions scenes are very loud and the spoken parts are very low in volume, I have to adjust through the movie!!!
B00AEFXGIY|5.0|Wonderful Babel.<br />Excellent movie, great actors. Leaves you breathless and somewhat confused ( Babel). I thoroughly enjoyed it, but it may be a good idea to watch it twice.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|This book got me curious about the back story of the main character from the start. Not only was the current situation for Rose well developed the twists and turns that were her life were beautifully woven together. The characters in this book are well drawn and the story quite addictive, romance, crime and mystery rolled into a satisfying story- don't miss it
B003G4W49C|5.0|It's rare that I find a story that I can enjoy again and again, and Ender's Game is one of those rare gems, the only sad thing about this book is that none of the other books in the series have the same level of feeling for me, it's not that they aren't good books, but only Ender's Game seems to hit the really incredible emotional notes that seem to touch my heart just right.  I think it's that Ender's Game is the story of a boy who is relentlessly manipulated (albeit for a &#34;noble&#34; cause) and then has to deal with the burden of success in ways that would be hard for even more developed emotionally people.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Found all 3 J P movies in Blu-ray and at a great price and in a convenient and easy package.
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|I found the book different and facinating.  In several parts when I started getting bored there would be a dramatic change which would reignite my interest and I couldn't put it down.  Quite an interesting array of characters.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Gory but interesting plot. This is Not for the weak of heart or stomach. Great characters and scary interaction between them.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was not a good book. Horrible compared to the first two. I was way disappointed for a book that I waited over a year to come out.
B0033AI41G|5.0|Best movie ever! I love this movie… it is based on a true story, so that is always a good movie to watch! I highly recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|A great ending to the trilogy. Bold choices by the author impressed me. I will certainly be reading anything Ms. Roth publishes in the future!
B004NOH9LW|4.0|It had all of the elements of a good storyline.  And Matt Damon is a great actor.  The movie made me cry.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Very few APP can be used with this gadget. Please liberate the code in orden to be used for developers
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This was better than the first one. I thought it was a lot of fun.  If you're watching these hoping to see oscar performance, move along. If you love the over the top action flicks if the 80's and 90's; bingo. They even make fun of themselves and it's really funny to watch these guys. Except Van Damme, he seemed to take himself way to seriously. Other than that, it's a good time.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Came exactly on time and was wrapped in the plastic that all new movies comes it. Played very well and I am enjoying it to the fullest.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|After playing 10tons' tennis game, I had high expectations. Either of these games far out-performs Angry Birds any day of the week.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was very moving and artfully written. It clearly demonstrates the power of words. It is a deep book, that makes one think critically about the human race.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Fun game. Something to do to pass the time. Not to challenging. Shooting Zombies with a 104 mm gun is always fun!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's one of those games that you just have to pass each level no matter if you want to keep playing or not....sensitively addictive!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device worked very well for me. It currnetly has full Intenet acess though my Windows 8 laptop and the device specific app access through my Android tablet. There is very little noticable lag time.
B004XISI4A|3.0|Hi, Haven't finished this yet but I am finding Bran's story is getting a bit weird. Other than that I am enjoying it.
B008NC2DF2|5.0|If you are a fan of Swans, this album carries the juggernaut ever forward.  In terms of evolution, Swans is the opposite of AC/DC.<br /><br />Album of the year for me.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Great game really enjoying it and hope to see some updates soon, encourage you to buy, great purchase for your money
0064430170|2.0|I can't say I understand what so many like about this one.  My kids like it well enough, but it's one of those books that I keep saying &#34;why?&#34;  I'm skeptical of the non-sense.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Was a really good season. I really like the new characters and the 11th doctor and Amelie Pond and Rory.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the second book of this incredible series keeps you thinking; making parallels to our own world.  can't wait to see the movie and make comparisons
B0097K21YW|5.0|Ok this game is SOOOOOOOOOOO fun! I was addicted to it. You have to aim the dinosaurs fire at the city to burn down the buildings. It's really fun and it has a cute little dinosaur. U should get this game.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Excellent movie!!  So realistic in terror movies.  Acting was great.  Shows everyone deserves a second chance in life.  Should make more movies with Tatum and Foxe.
B00CAMGHA8|5.0|I like this adjustable mini tripod and very good for my small mini roko projector for my home theater  thank you so much.
B0002HZSE4|5.0|This is my all time favorite Schleich barn animal. It's the heaviest one we have - actually heavier and slightly bigger seeming than the Tinker Stallion. The colors are beautiful, prettier than the pictures even. A star in the barn.
B00GFOIUVQ|5.0|awsome game awsome but by the time you buy all the stuff you need you will be broke they give you a suit you need then after you buy the next world you have to buy the suit for it so you can pass the level iam not talking hard impassable you get half the way then its time to caugh up more money before you know it you bought a new release xbox game very cool but its about money money to contiune a level orther than that very cool just one flat rate for god sake
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Some parts were laugh-out-loud funny, other diary entries were tedious. Good book for light reading, sorry it won't be a movie.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|On the plus side it had a morally redemptive message, but the whole story could have been told with less distractions,msuch as nudity, unnecessary to the story.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|If you want a great language app, this is it! Worth the time I'm putting into it.  It's definitely a great refresher and learning tool for language.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i have it on my tablet, my phone and my laptop.  i am never anywhere without one of them.  stuck in a doctors office? whip out my kindle and i can read
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I didn't really have any expectations going into it but it really surpassed what I thought I was getting.  The plot was not what I thought it was going to be about but I found that it was still very good.  I was drawn into the characters and the acting was surpurb.  Definately glad I watched it.
B00DSTBMMU|3.0|Based on the single \\"Easy\\", you can easily be forgiven for wondering what the hype is about regarding Sheryl Crow's supposed 'reinvention' as a country artist.  Crow is a maddening artist, because despite her obvious talent and ability to make fine music, she's racked up a pile of some of the most irritating and insipid pop singles of the past 20 years, including \\"If It Makes You Happy\\", \\"Soak Up The Sun\\", and now the laughably banal and tossed-off \\"Easy\\" among them, songs that make it hard to even take her halfway seriously as an artist.<br /><br />I had read beforehand that \\"Easy\\" was essentially a deliberately dumbed-down cheap shot to get radio play and that it isn't an accurate representation of the album overall, and it turns out there is a certain truth in that.  \\"Easy\\" sounds pretty much exactly like what I'd expect from Crow, and doesn't give the slightest indicator of her having 'gone country'.  But after actually giving the entirety of \\"Feels Like Home\\", I'm now less cynical about the whole 'country' reinvention, because the country vibe is indeed felt, and quite credibly at that.<br /><br />There are some fine songs here.  When the energy level gets kicked up on the riffy opening track \\"Shotgun\\" and the swinging, harmonica-laced blues-rocker \\"Best Of Times\\", the record is downright enjoyable.  The album closer \\"Stay At Home Mother\\" is a standout track, a highly tuneful and surprisingly moving ballad.  \\"We Ought To Be Drinkin'\\", with a scaled-back arrangement that gets nicely embellished, is also well worth the effort.<br /><br />Still though, there are numerous forgettable tunes including the formulaic country weepfest \\"Waterproof Mascara\\",  the run-of-the-mill adult contemporary ballad \\"Homesick\\", the totally phoned in 'heart-it-a-zillion-times-before' \\"Callin' You When I'm Lonely\\", and the rote shuffle \\"Nobody's Business\\".<br /><br />It's kind of a shame the record doesn't consistently live up to the standard of its best tracks, but it's a lot better than \\"Easy\\" would lead you to believe, and if you enjoy staying on top of things in the country-pop world, there's definitely a clutch of tracks from \\"Feels Like Home\\" worth adding to your playlist.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|this book is well written and well worth the read.  the only downside is that you have to wait for the next book to come out now... grr!
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Good story filled with emotion . I would highly recommend this wonderful book. The characters are very real. The writing is rich with visual imagery .
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I had the free version of this.. It has video advertisements... So I downloaded this full version so I wouldn't have to watch the ads.  Doing so caused me to lose all of my saved data for the game.  I uninstalled the previous version before installing this one.  I thought others may like to know that.  The game itself is a great time killer...
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Fantastic effects, good acting, and fun to watch, but the my husband and I were pretty let down by the ending.  If you like your mystery stories to make sense at the reveal, I suspect you will be too.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I never thought I would have the least interest reading about a woman scientist in the 1800's who was studying mosses. That being said, I could not put this book down. The character development and the sweeping history of the Botanical Industry during that era was captivating. Elizabeth Gilbert has created a masterful work, a book that is now in my top 5 reads of all time. Don't miss reading this beautiful and awe-inspiring book!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Very cute movie and appropriate for adults and kids. My whole family enjoyed it. Funny and heart-felt. I can't think of anything else to say.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I would have gave it a 5 star if continuation was close to where I left off. Instead one has to start from the beginning of every try. Overall, great visuals and controlled.
B001TH16DI|5.0|The whole collection in one place from the original cast - great.  The odd number Trek's weren't nearly as good as the even numbered ones, but having the entire collection to choose from is fantastic.

B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Outstanding. Loved it. Gilbert has become a major writer with this book great story  and amazingly well written. Alma is a fascinating heroine.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The best book you will ever read<br />Except for Maybe numbers 2 and 3<br />Seriously 5 star worthy<br />Number 1 on the market
B001974DG0|5.0|Just read it!!! I don't want to say anything else b/c it's not necessary. Amazing book!! Do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK!!! <3<3<3
B000003N7F|5.0|Great Album! I was very pleased with this record and the shipping time. It is very relaxing and soothing, perfect for a night in with a glass of wine.
B000001DVD|5.0|Although it was produced by Mutt Lange (AC/DC fame) and sounds familiar with AC/DC, this album is raw hard rock and stands on its own.  All of the songs are good rock bangers (one ballad but still rocks) and they still sounded raw with a little production polish.  Let It Go, Another Hit and Run, High n Dry, You Got Me Runnin', Lady Strange and Mirror Mirror are all classics.  After Pyromania, Hysteria etc came out with all of the melodic layers of bs and fanfare,  I've come to appreciate this album even more.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am so sorry that Mr Flynn passed away so young.  I enjoyed all his books.  Mitch Rapp is a great character
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy playing this game on my iPhone and my kindle after a long day of work . It helps me to unwind amd relax!!

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|i loved it, very nice and touching movie. recommend it to all drinkers to watch it.dont drink and drive ( fly).
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My daughter (3) would never stop playing. She gets a kick out of &#34;doing hair&#34; and often spends a lot of her app time on this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted to this game.  I love it.  What more can I say, don't like that you make me put in more words than I want to say.
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|This is a great app and I have it on multiple devices. I love that I'm not locked into one language and I have loads of fun. One downfall is trying to memorize the special characters within some languages, but I think that falls on the keyboards. If I'm learning french, why not show me a french keyboard?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This has to be right up there with some of the best shows I have ever seen.  Absolutely love this series.  I hope it never ends.  Can't wait for Season 4.

B001QURIYO|5.0|The first track on this CD is what got me addicted to Trip-Hop, which progressed to Trance/Dance/EDM.  Bobby Gillespie was supposed to meet me at a show in NYC for an interview, found out later Customs wouldn't let him in.  The replacement band was The black Crows, so I was TOO disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It was extremely predictable. Wasn't as captivated as I was with the other two books. The story line wasn't as engaging, but I was curious as to where the author was going with the story. I was not thrilled with the ending, but it did make sense. Overall okay, but wish it was better.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|No wonder this is topping evry top Ten List in every catagory.  It's an amazing album by an amazing singer.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved the first two books in this trilogy and was so excited for Allegiant! Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the way this series ended (don't want to be a spoiler)

B007REV4T8|4.0|A very satisfying James Bond film. The part where M read Tennyson was especially effective, as was the delicious irony in that scene - &#34;how safe do you feel?&#34;<br /><br />The title song is great and sets the mood, even though the visuals are too dark. And too much sex and violence throughout the film. But this is James Bond so I knew what I was signing up for. Bardem did a great job of being a menacing, and just plain yucky, villain.<br /><br />Overall, the heroism in the film was inspiring.
B009LOJK1Q|1.0|Worst book ever. Made it up as he went along . . .this has turned me off Stephen King's books for a while.
B000H30B2C|5.0|Simply a visual and emotional spectacle. Jackson's Kong puts new life into a classic story of Beauty and the Beast.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Steinbeck tells this tale through the language and eyes of a family who farmed in Oklahoma. This family is forced to move from their beloved homestead due to a drought and The Depression.  It it a little difficult to read the broken English and slang expressions of the farmers at first but as the story moves along the reader feels empathy and sympathy for the people who have become migrant workers at the beck and call of others in order to survive.<br /><br />This author captures the heart and soul of this family who will do anything to save each other and keep their family together.  They experience much hardships and tragedies but show a resilience that is astounding to see how they make do with so little and yet show such compassion for others.<br /><br />This tale was written in 1939 but is still timely in its message of the meaning of love of family and survival of the fittest. It also conveys the differences of those who are affluent and those who are needy.  It is a very moving story that will stay with you for a very long time.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Well, what can I say. it works fine. I've had no trouble with it doing what it supposed to do. I've used it for over a year and no problems.

B00821OX98|5.0|Excellent series.  Cannot wait for the next season.  Fast moving with good character development.  Would have completely missed it if not for Amazon
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very well done modern take on the genius.  Good chemistry between Sherlock and Watson.  Format puts you in Sherlock's shoes and reveals his thought process, which is more entertaining than waiting for him to reveal it all to a dumbfounded Watson at the end as traditional renditions and books do.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|The item arrived on time and was just as expected. It played as expected and is a very good movie. I like this product and highly recommend the seller. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B008Y768XO|4.0|Excellent, very touching.  Loved how the dog was brought to the man and the bond they had.  I highly recommend it

B0036S4B6M|5.0|Well Done Book about current prison life for women. It is factual, interesting, important and shows such an enormous waste of human potential for both the prisoners and the guard staff. Literacy could be taught. Basic life management skills could be taught. Trades and money making activities could be taught. It is vital to turn this situation around and improve our prison system asap. I am glad Kerman brought it to our attention and consider her a leader in this situation. I am telling all my reading friends about this book and cause.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I see what she was doing in trying to be unpredictable with Tris and her choices but would've liked to have some decisions a little more fleshed out. Did like the alternating chapters between Tobias and Tris, although it was easier to follow bc I was listening to it on audio book. Did not like the ending though. I read these books for an escape, not reality.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|When a main character dies, it's a buzz kill. I didn't think that it was necessary and it wasn't a great way to end the trilogy.
B00C9PQ7EW|5.0|first one arrived damage but it was sorted out and the replacement arrived intact, enjoyed the record very much thank you
0985557834|5.0|it is the simplest to follow.  I love the illustrations.  I wish there were more examples using buckles.  Still it is fun to tie the different knots.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Laughed until I cried,  very funny read! Allie could be me as she relates her feelings and adventures. Whether in words or pictures, there is an unmistakable sense of self and humour. Loved it!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|It only took decades, numerous embarrassing miscues and one real gem of a film (Christopher Reeve's first Superman film) to figure out how to turn the iconic Superman character into a real movie star. Previous films dealt with more Silver age type adventures as the character of Superman became more and more like Clark Kent, instead of the reverse. Now we are presented with yet another version as another new-ish actor and a new hot director try to solve the long standing riddle of making a great Superman movie. In this case it appears they have. Man of Steel finally just shucks aside the humanity and admits that despite any protestations to the opposite, Kal El is a God. And he needs to fight other Gods. Like Zod. And when Gods do battle among mere mortals, humanity is swept aside in a terrible wave of carnage. And it is finally exciting because we are shown this is a film where there are terrible consequences to punching someone with the power of a thousand tons of TNT and driving them through multiple buildings. Buildings collapse and the people inside die, often falling like confetti to the streets below. It is at once both terrible and wonderful to behold. Finally the feeling of the danger and the speed inherit in the concept of a super powered slugfest is fully expressed with astounding visual and audio effects. The picture is top notch, the 7 channel sound is fully immersive and this is a movie you need in your Blu-ray player now. Can't wait for the sequel!
B00G32QIEG|3.0|The acting was great. the plot started off great but did not like the ending. the storyline was all over the place. I like the fact that it was a dark comedy.

1452126577|5.0|This is a really funny book!  The captions are so purrfect.  My husband actually is reading it now.  Some of those sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek remarks kind of sound like things he would say.  This one is a keeper!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|well written script, excellent actors, trailler, and well produce film. I enjoyed it very much. Top draw this movies will keep you at the edge of your seat and more.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I have watched this movie about 5 times now since I first bought it, and wish now that I had gone to see it in the theatre.  I saw the movie before I read the book, but enjoyed both of them thoroughly and can't decide on which is better.  Basically, they are both good and the movie is very true to the book in all the right ways.<br /><br />The Help is set in Jackson MS in the early 1960's, when most of the rich or up and coming white families had maids.  Skeeter (her nickname due to her height and thin build, one of many things that her mother despairs of in finding her a husband) just got back from college and gets a job writing a housekeeping column under another name.  Of course, she knows nothing about housekeeping, so goes to one of her friend's maids, Aibileen, for help.  She can't go to her own, because the maid she grew up with, who essentially raised her, has left and no one will tell her why.<br /><br />In attempting to get a job in NYC, Skeeter is encouraged by a big city editor, and decides to approach the maids to tell their stories and put them together in a book.  This is very risky business considering the climate of the time, where the least that might happen to them if they are found out is that they will lose their jobs.  We get to meet several of them, including the unfolding of Aibileen's story, Minny's story (the best of the lot and this actress deserved all the praise she got!), and more...plus the stories of the &#34;white ladies&#34; they work for such as the poor but hopeful Elizabeth, the &#34;white trash&#34; Celia who married the best looking man around, and the infamous Miss Hilly, who runs just about every social organization she can in the town of Jackson.  Don't worry...she gets what's coming to her with the &#34;Terrible Awful,&#34; a plot point that you will never forget.<br /><br />Beautifully told, with a great script and wonderful acting, I loved this movie...and ended up laughing and crying in equal measure.  The whole 1960's look of the homes and the clothing was also well done.  But the real winners of the movie were Aibileen and Minny, whose lives I was far more interested in than that of Miss Skeeter's.  I don't know how accurate some of the movie was to the time and the place, but it definitely highlights a moment in history when great changes were beginning, including the heartbreak and pain along the way.<br /><br />Highly highly recommended!
B00FOQRNPA|5.0|A must read for anyone who has any concern about their Heath and their future chance of mental health issues

B00E0SX118|5.0|This movie is fun for everyone. Excellent animation, great story line, very, very funny. I have watched it many times now, for the kids of course! :O)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Veronica Roth weaves a mesmerizing tale throughout the trilogy and leaves the reader nearly lost for words with the conclusion.  Well worth the time spent.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show has managed to keep you pulled into the story line. Some of the main characters have been killed,replaced with additional characters, not taking their place but with new unique spectrums of strengths and weaknesses of their own. Who knew zombies could be this interesting! Always love a cliff hanger.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have the first Kindle Fire, and this was my cover of choice.  It was worth waiting for! It even looks suitably loved and worn as I use it more!
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|Such a cool twist on the &#34;horror&#34; genre. We have shared it with all our friends and have seen it four times in the last year.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game!!!  Soo happy now on Kindle!!  Love all the different levels and rewards. A game I look forward to playing a long time. Will tell all my friends! Thanks so much!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really liked the first 2 books and was going to read the 3rd one regardless of all the negative reviews. I actually liked it, maybe because i started reading it with such low expectations. To me the level of writing was the same and the story flowed nicely. Of course expect for what happens in the end, it is sad but sort of fits the story.
0790731452|5.0|One of the greatest film masterpieces known to earthlings.  Almost as good as &#34;The Brother From Another Planet,&#34; only it's just funny as hell, not profound . . .
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This was a very well done end to the series. It was shocking and real. Heartbreaking, even. I liked it, but didn't love it. However, I'm not sure what I would have changed to make it better. It was almost as though it wrapped up a little too easy.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|I have trouble understanding why so many other reviewers didn't enjoy this show.  The band is in fine form, Morrison does a seamless and really eerie blend of four different songs, giving it a cinematic feel: (he goes from one of the most viscerally alarming performance of &#34;When the Music's Over&#34; into &#34;Break On Through&#34; to &#34;The Soft Parade&#34; to &#34;Crossroads&#34; without missing a beat).  His voice isn't what it always was, but this is a 1970 show, so that's sort of the deal for any regular listener.<br /><br />They are also having a great deal of fun, even making humorous light of the Miami incident when Morrison introduces Manzarek for a blues/organ version of &#34;Close To You&#34;.  He lets the audience know that they are in &#34;for a special treat&#34;, and immediately assume he's going to expose himself and cause ruckus.  &#34;No no, not that&#34;, he responds laconically.  &#34;The last time that happened, policeman were turning in their badges, grown men were weeping!&#34;  The band was probably a little nervous and he knew what he was doing, but it's still hilarious when you consider their situation at the time.<br /><br />I would recommend this for the casual fan or the archivist.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very good.  Couldn't stop reading it.  Had to find out who got the money.  Can't wait for the next book.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great story of fear and conquering fear excellent recommend it to everyone. Recommend it to anyone who is interested in a real-life  sci fi
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was hard to read because of the subject matter but I had to finish it because I loved the characters and cared deeply about them. I liked the story being told from Death's point of view - very original. It worked. And I liked reading something about how it was for some Germans during this time. A masterful book in my opinion.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book has a better plot and there is more happening.  Like the first book it leaves you hanging so book 3 is a must if you want to know what happens next.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was hard to put down! Read it in 2 days! Easy to get lost in Liane Moriarty's characters.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I found it tiring reading over and over again Ana was &#34;looking up through her lashes.&#34;  I didn't feel there was much of a plot and the writing wasn't what I expected.  The only reason I read book 2 was the last chapter leaves you hanging and I wanted to know what happens.  So if you read book 1 the other 2 books do have more of a plot and it does get better.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|A heart pounding read.  The nousphere and its all too real & fragile complexities is already upon us.<br />,Recommend not reading before bedtime.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book brings it all together but the ending was a repeat of book 1.  Putting all 3 books together it was a good trilogy.
B004NSULHM|5.0|This is an album that is only going to grow in fan appreciation over time. It took me several spins to get a handle on The King of Limbs -- even 2 1/2 years after its release, I still have a hard time wrapping my head around it sometimes. It is Radiohead's shortest, densest, most understated & most groove-driven record. I was pretty frustrated with it at first pass, especially given my love of the band's previous In Rainbows, which lives at the other end of their sonic spectrum. Whereas IR is one of the band's more traditional \\"rock band\\" efforts, TKOL sounds like it could've been assembled by one person's hand -- which isn't to suggest that it was. Whereas Thom Yorke's solo album and Atoms for Peace side project tilt firmly toward the \\"electronic\\" genre, the sound of this album (to my ears) is something more akin to \\"organic electronica,\\" perhaps in the vein of previous work from Four Tet or Caribou. To varying degrees, the songs here were initially assembled from live loops each member created alone, and then assembled in the studio. Obviously not every sound here is looped -- there's clearly some live playing here and there and Nigel Godrich's typical production treatment smooths over the songs in much the same fashion as their previous work. But the overall effect is one of rusty, warped, old vinyl samples stirring to life in separate rooms and assembling in an all-new way. Pointillist production abounds, and it really does take a close, focused listen to pick apart what's happening at all levels of the mix.<br /><br />As you can probably tell from that description, this is not music that calls attention to itself, and for that reason I think many fans and critics were disappointed upon first listen. But if you recognize that Radiohead is not always the most \\"immediate\\" of bands and you're willing to put in the effort, this has the potential to become an incredibly rewarding listen. I think in time it'll grow to be seen as one of the band's best efforts in an already impressive catalogue. This one just takes a little bit longer to sink in.

There is not one bad song on this album. God Bless Stryper.

1420934295|4.0|Very good reference for anatomy.  Artists should find this book helpful.  Fine detailed drawings of human anatomy with various views make this a good reference when trying to draw the figure.
B00G9QLP9Y|4.0|Very user friendly! Has just the maps that I was looking for. I like the ability to view maps on my Kindle HD.
B00GIY5OGC|5.0|awesome movie.  Amazon makes it easy to watch the movies you want billing straight from your amazon account. Love it.
B00ESY827C|4.0|This film is a dramatic yet great way to understand the Roaring Twenties. It could be useful for high school social studies teachers.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A reminder of Faulkner and his early penchant for multiple narrators, Flynn is top-shelf, dark and no one-hit novelist turning out diluted versions of their first and only great book(I put Amy Tan in this group-Joy Luck Club has not been neared).<br />I was blown away by Gone Girl and this book, with the multiple narrators, hits as also an original. This lady cannot write fast enough for me, I will start her Sharp Objects soon and only hope for more.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00GHJ1S2M|3.0|I became a fan of Lady Gaga during Born This Way. I loved every song on the album except Government Hooker (which is still an okay song, in my view). I loved some of her earlier stuff too (Bad Romance, Love Game, Speechless, Poker Face, Brown Eyes, Paparazzi, Just Dance, etc.) but I REALLY loved Born This Way.<br /><br />When I heard the first single \\"Applause,\\" I was a little disappointed, but it grew on me. Overall, I rate this album 3 out of 5 stars. The second part of the album is much stronger. Some of the lyrics are just too cheesy, forced, and cliched to get past. There are some really good beats, really good (the potential is there for some awesome mixes). I hesitate to use the word pretentious, but honestly, a lot of this album comes off as just that, especially when she is talking about sex and fashion. She talks about her *** being famous and being rich as ****. Some of the lyrics are cringe-worthy.<br /><br />My favorites are Dope and Gypsy.<br /><br />I REALLY like Artpop, Fashion, Do What You Want, Aura, Applause, and Mary Jane Holland. Venus, G.U.Y., Donatella, and Swine are really growing on me. But I think Jewels and Drugs, Manicure, and Sex Dreams are just AWFUL songs.<br /><br />(The MP3 album is $5.99 right now so it was worth purchasing.)<br /><br />The more I listen to it, the more I like it, but it's still not my favorite.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A very entertaining mystery with good writing as well. Definitely not the usual legal thriller, lots of twists and turns! I love a book that leaves me with a smile.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Warm message for 10-100 yr olds alike. Could have had a little less detail towards the end and still be a &#34;wonder&#34;ful read.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|Awesome coming of age movie. Funny, sad, and a great story.  The soundtrack is perfect! You will watch it again and again.
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I love the movies with action and all of the Fast and Furious movies have that.  I have completed the entire series and the movies are always good to re-watch.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has a great voice and this is a great CD.<br />I like all the songs and it puts me in a good mood.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|As usual, an exciting, intricate plot and good chemistry among the cast.  One definitely needs to pay close attention to fully appreciate the story line.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|It was awesome! I loved all the episodes. Fast delivery. Very satisfied with the purchase. Look forward to receiving my next order &#34; bones- season 9&#34;.
B009ZQJ0ME|1.0|No clear story line, no chemistry, poor acting.  Another example of today's directors leaning on special effects and CGI instead of talent to make a movie.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|This was an amazing man.  I didn't realize how awful the end of his life would be when I started the book and I was devastated when I got there, but his heroics were awesome.  He was for his 'boys' and didn't worry about himself.
B004YSDT52|4.0|I particularly liked the opening, where it lacks the fifth star, in my opinion, is because after the first 30 minutes it was almost predictable what only conclusive options would remain available in the end once the detective, Al Pacino's, partner was inadvertently gunned down.  However, all in all, it was a good movie worth watching.  Since I have been for 19 years an investigator who has written a book PURSUIT OF EXHIBIT 35 in the OJ Simpson Murder Trial and its Hidden Secrets, and a documentary SERPENTS RISING: An Independent Investigation of the OJ Simpson Murder Trial, I guess I've become jaundiced at viewing predictable conclusions.  I need my uncertainty just like my liquor, straight, and no chaser.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fantastic book! I absolutely loved reading it. If you like sci-fi you will love Ender's Game!! I would definitely recommend this book.
B0030FKUMA|5.0|I have many other editions of this oft-reissued title (Rock Machine, Disky, Festival, Snapper) and this Japanese reissue beats them all in terms of sound quality (not night and day better, but noticable improvements in bass and smoother high end).  Don't get this lp if you're Genesis fan, it's totally different to their later prog sounds. But if you like superbly crafted late 60's innovative pop songs this is a must. It compares somewhat to the experimental psych-pop of Family, Skip Bifferty, Tommorrow  and even early King Crimson but with its piano and 12 string acoustic guitar based arrangements, sounds like a 'progressive' Rubber Soul.  Just a great great album.<br />Now if someone could legitimately issue the mega-rare different mono mix of this lp, I could die happy :)
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Okay movie helped out by a great performance by Denzel Washington.  If you are a fan of Denzel this movie is a must watch.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|It's all just okay, not much of an interesting plot.  Average acting.  Average special effects. A good watch with the family - the kids liked it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Very large numbers and buttons. Easy for me to use ans see. Much better than the one on my computer. If you have bad eyesight or big fingers this is the app you want.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|I first &#34;met&#34; Malala on the 20/20 special a couple of months ago and knew I had to read her book.  What an amazing story.  Malala is one brave, determined young lady and will go far!  If you haven't read it, you should.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great version of the game. Lots of layouts to choose from and lots of screen options. I like the size of the tiles and they are ready to see'. I'd highly recommend this game.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Lots of fun. Having the comic inbetween is a nice break from one game after another. I also like the different tiles and setups.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Pretty good book- not particularly well-written- she holds back on a lot of the details of her relationships with fellow inmates- but it's nice to have context for the show.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great work of fiction based in the deep south! This is one of his best books in my opinion.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|The final installment of the divergent trilogy brings clarity to the story, tying up loose ends and showing how life goes on after tragedy while allowing it to be a catalyst for change.  Definitely not happily ever after but true to the characters.
B00EKR61FM|4.0|I bought this boxed set not from Amazon. It is $10 more expensive on here than at Wal-Mart or Best Buy, which both offer the Blu-Ray collection for $50. That's why Amazon gets 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, it's fantastic. I am loving all of the behind-the-scenes footage and the special features, and of course the quality is absolutely fabulous because they are Blu-Ray discs. Even on my CRT TV, it looks really nice. Highly recommend!
1600595871|5.0|So many ideas to choose from.  You can choose a variety of techniques to suit the type of book you are making.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|I  thoroughly enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond and he delivered again.  Javier Bardem as Silva was fantastic.  The cinematography was on point as were the locations used.  Saw this the first time during it's theatrical release and as you can see I'm enjoying it again on Amazon.  The streaming was seamless through Amazon's servers.  I will be catching more movies this week!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This is a weaker narrative than its predecessors. The previous stories have been leading to the great truth, of what may lie outside the city, only to have it all explained by the first act. What follows are a series of plot lines that only service to set up the purposefully inflammatory climax - let's be honest, that ending was created to elicit a forced poetic finale.  While the ending is not what many desired, what bothers me most are the forced mechanisms that bring the events to fruition.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|If it had a quit button, I would readily agree to give it an extra star. Not a bad concept, definitely a bit like a few Rovio games that I can think of.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|A modern science fiction masterpiece. I highly recommend it. You don't have to go on to read the many other books, it stands alone beautifully.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Fabulous! I love it! I almost purchased an HDMI cord to use with my Nook for like $45 when I stumbled across the Chromecast, quite by accident. No wires, you can stream from the tablet, phone OR laptop, you do NOT have to watch on the device whatever you are casting to the TV (you could play a game while casting Netflix or Youtube), AND it was $10 cheaper!! Apparently, a lot of improvements and developments are underway as well, so I can only expect things to get even better-BONUS!!<br /><br />Highly recommend!!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Excellent movie, lots of action and excitement. Feels more like a throwback to the old Sean Connery &#34;Bond&#34; films. Skyfall is the best of the Daniel Craig &#34;Bond&#34; films.
B00021HBGS|5.0|We bought this two years ago for my son and we still have them. They have survived nightly bath time and teething from two babies. Now that he is older, he likes naming and counting all of the vehicles.
B002QVZ71I|3.0|About how I thought it would be and okay but not great! Would you feel it was waste of your time? Just maybe if you had something else to do.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game and I even update  it but now every time I try to play it just kicks me  off. It says checking for updates (which I did already) and just returns back to my kindle home page. Please fix it I would really love to play again.
B005ZO6NRA|4.0|I really have mixed reviews about this movie, I love Jason playing Conan, an the action was good, but it was some of the story lines especially towards the end. It was kinda anticlimactic I kept waiting for the story to get bigger but it just kinda fizzled out. It could have ended so much better! It started so good an ended so bad. I might watch it again to see if I'm wrong or just to watch Jason... LOL
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book. When this came out my whole entire school wanted to buy it! Very funny addictive book, I have the whole<br />Entire series of this book so stop reading my review and buy it and READ IT!!!
B005PK56TA|3.0|Good effort to pay homage to the many devices employed by horror films made in the last 40 years or so.  From the creepy fleeting passage of a danger unseen by the protagonist (but seen by the viewer) to just plain good old fashioned gore, the creators of this show do a nice job...at the beginning.  But this sort of stuff is best consumed start-to-finish in an hour and a half, not in a 12-episode series.<br /><br />By the mid-point of the series, it ceases to be scary, maybe a little spooky, but your interest is still held by each episode's revelation of a new disturbing chapter in the house's history.  But it's starting to turn into a soap opera, as the mystery vanishes and the cast of characters in the house continues to grow.<br /><br />By the last few episodes, there's no scare left in the program, and you've pretty much got the whole thing figured out if you've thought about it much.  It's become pretty much 100% soap opera drama by this time.  I don't know how you could keep a single theme scary for 12 hours, but kudos for trying, I guess.  A satisfying series, I suppose.  The sex was a bit overdone.  The prudish in the audience will probably want to know why it's relevant to the story.  Aside from one or two bits that play into the story, it's just gratuitous.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|This was a great family movie, perfect for a 3 year old girl and a 6 year old boy. We all enjoyed it.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Loved it / hated it -- could not put it down!  Some passages so eloquent they will haunt me forever.
B0016K40KY|5.0|Its one of the Greatest films ever made...whats not to love??? The film was ahead of its time in screen plays, in development, directing, acting. Excellent story line and the movie flowed!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am not one to typically leave reviews but I had to for this book.<br /><br />I waited in anticipation for this book to come out, then  I waited for time where I could read this uninterrupted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a friend did not realize that I did not read this right away and blurted out the ending when I was only half way though the book.  I am thankful that she did.  I out the book down and walked away.  I will not pick it back up.<br /><br />I became emotionally invested in these characters and I feel like I was slapped in the face with betrayal.<br /><br />I will not read another book by this author again.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|real page turner, love all of John Grisham books and this is one of his best, i'm still reading it on my Kindle and can't wait to see the outcome
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has done it again. OUTSTANDING.  I hope this will be made into a movie like Time To Kill and with the same stars.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Bridget was written as exactly the same character as she was in Bridget Jones Diary.  Bridget was relatable as a 30's single girl, it was annoying that her character was not allowed to grow at all over the next 20 years.  The book is a regurgitation of the original story, with a pat and completely expected ending.
B00271DNP4|5.0|It is rare that a series can do such a great job of staying true to the books,  especially when the movies have a variety of directors.  Don't expect the movie to cover every detail of the book exactly as your imagination pictures,  but do expect it to hold as true as possible within a reasonable length if time. Well done!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This will raise hackles, since the story of Jesus as a human is supposed to (but does not) decide whether Jesus actually rose from the dead, went north, and then hobnobbed with the Apostles as reported in Acts.  One can go either way, given the political/ideological need for a resurrection and at the same time,eye- witness reports of the empty tomb by a couple of his supporters.  Also, were they actually devils cast out, or was the bible story a selected set of accounts of successful attempts at ancient psychotherapy?
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Not as exciting as season 1 but still intriguing. Characters are showing more of same. Would like a new twist.
B001BANK32|5.0|Read this again before Doctor Sleep was released.  I read it 30 years ago and was amazed at how much I remembered and also how much I'd forgotten.  Knowing how it ended did not distract from the elevated heartrate I experienced while reading one of King's best stories.  Personally, I place The Shining in my top 5 King novels. Classic American Lit at it's best.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Felt like this story was rushed compared to other two. Very slow moving and not at all what I personally wanted to see happen with the story, kind of anticlimactic .
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Donna Tartt is one of my favorite authors. It's twisty and slightly dark and full of perfectly chosen words. Read this book, then read &#34;The Secret History&#34; as well -her perspective is deep and piercing, love it!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|Of the 20 I checked out on line, of the 37 Flashlight apps that were there. This one gives the least amount of permissions to invade my privacy. Go to &#34;app manager&#34; and check it  out for yourself.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|It is a great original sci-fi adventure.  Smart and witty dialog, quirky characters, intriguing backstory, and a space story with overtones of the great old westerns make up this unique show.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Two options to get what you need, type the word or just speak it and it's fast. Something I use daily.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game! Best bingo game there is!! I have told many of my friends about this game and now they are playing it too!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It's like sitting with a good friend who just happens to be a plain spoken spiritual leader with all the time in the world for you.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|It was a good funny spoof of the Star Trek series.  I thought they did a good job of portraying it that way.
B008602KQI|5.0|Well done.  Had to see it without interruption because I did not want to miss anything.  Can't wait to see the latest movie.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite books. Having it on my kindle just makes it easier to read whenever I want.
B00138H28Q|5.0|Excellent album that any fan of the Velvet Underground would likely enjoy. It might be a bit downbeat for some, however I love it!!! God bless, you Lou! You created fantastic music!
B000HKYN74|2.0|I thought the changes they made following the first two seasons were terrible. It was so much better when they were explorers.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Of all the ridiculous scenarios that have been offered for our amusement, this movie is surely king of the hill.  I enjoy a decent suspension of reality if it smells possible, but taking over the White House!?  Just a simple question: why were the National Guardsmen not firing at the suvs chasing the presidential limo?  And just for kicks, how does a rocket propelled grenade destroy an M1A2 Abrams tank by hitting it in its toughest spot, the front?  A:  It would not.  Another inaccuracy:  the windows on the presidential limo do not roll down!  This was just another poor redux of Die Hard, and a spectacularly bad one at that!  It cheeses me that I will never see that 120mins of my life again!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I somehow missed this when it came out and saw it and didn't think the synopsis sounded all that great - going back to prevent Kennedy's death ... but I downloaded it anyway and once I started, I can't stop, I'm actually having to slow myself down to savor it more.  One of his best and I like all his books (other than Dark Tower).  I would recomend this even to non-King fans.  It is intersting on many levels.  I've been trying to catch him on mentioning things in the 60s that were not yet discovered.  One I think stands out is there is a young girl playing soccer in the street in Dallas in 1962.  I doubt this one.  But other than that, his attention to detail going back to the 60s is very good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The story is just extremely amazing. This continuation is no less interesting as the first book. Its a must read.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|Was kind of fun, but not something I kept on the system. If you can get it for free have fun, if not it is probably a pass.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Read this book.  It will definitely make you a better person.  Fantastically flawed characters, a story that rips your heart out but still makes you feel hopeful, such a good book.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Awesome game, truly nothing is more fun than killing people while riding a giant flying baby. The only downside of this game is that you will need to purchase the in app purchase of more levels pretty early in the game. I would have rather just paid the $2 up front, but I guess that is just a personal preference.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Well written, good story, unique.  Baldacci creates good characters, his books move well and have reasonable chapter lengths. Dialog between characters very good
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Fantastic story line.  Filmed like a movie.  Great plot line, keeps you salivating for more of this fantastic story.  Wonderful.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Would have gave it 5 stars but the game experiences lag on kindle fire 7&quot; 2nd gen.  My . Oldest son loves iron man and all the different suits you can build.  Hours of fun for the two of us!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Was like a good book, couldn't put it down.  Once me and my son started watching, we wound up staying up past midnight to finish an episode.  Not disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great continuation of the series!  Glad I can still stream with Amazon Prime and included in my membership!  Looking forward to Season 3!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Best TV watching ever. 5 Stars for sure.  Watched them almost consecutively for first three seasons.  Can't wait until the final season is out.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|I love this game a lot. It passes the time of playing more. It has good graphic and very talkative and funny.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I think John Grisham is awesome.  This is his best book yet!  Sat down to read and didn't get up til I was finished.
1451666179|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! I've been a reader of the blog for a few years now, and having the new stories in there alone made it worth the cost! But it's so nice to have a copy of all my favorites, like &#34;God of Cake&#34;, so even without the internet I can read them :)
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Well it took to short of time and my daughter love's long books so my daughter did not really like this book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large display and buttons.Tracks input.Very helpful on jobsite for figuring out linear and square footage totals for materials.Must use stylus whlie wearing gloves.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't normally take the time to write reviews, but I feel it's necessary for this book. I LOVED IT. I laughed, I cried, and all the while I kept wondering what would happen next (and I was always wrong haha). I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting a good read.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|Great game all the way. I just wish that you didn't have to wait for upgrades to install, and that there wasn't an energy core that you have to wait to replenish.
B004M66YSA|5.0|AWSOME BAND, FAST SHIPPING..THIS IS A BAND THAT SHOULD ON EVERYONES RADIO BUT THE MUSIC INDUSTRY PUSHED TRASH LIKE MILEY CYRESS AND GARBAGE LIKE LADY GAGA...OR JUSTIN BEBER. I WISH PEOPLE HAD MORE TASTE THAN TO KEEP SUPPORTING SUCH TRASH MUSIC, DONT GET ME STARTED WITH RAP.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I'm not sure what it is that this book is missing, but I found that my mind kept wandering while reading it. I do think that this story lacks the utter terror of an ultracreepy antagonist; the guy is your garden variety (at least in mystery books) serial killer. And then of course there are all of those pages that have to be devoted to filling in the new reader about the characters' pasts (yawn.) I didn't get any sense of knowing any of the victims or the other new characters; they were all pretty flat. There was nothing particularly interesting about the autopsy, although the PIT room did capture my imagination. This book seemed to spend a lot of its time meandering around inside Scarpetta's and Benton Wesley's heads. Even Marino seemed to revert to a two-dimensional character. This book just didn't compel me. Sorry, Ms. Cornwell. Still a fan, but this one just doesn't compare with some of the earlier Scarpetta novels.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always  John Grisham's stories keep you reading til the end.  Recommend this book makes for a good story to get to keep your attention.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I just love everything and everybody in this series. Don't know what I'll watch when it ends. Hope it never does.
B000Y179KO|5.0|Very nicely done and you can hear the sadness of the upcoming break-up in the music.  I would recommend it.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and I think it tells a great story of our complacency for our corrupt judicial system.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|I love it! Bridget is finally back! A great book.I read it all in one sitting. Now I am looking forward to the film!
B00G91Z8AQ|4.0|This is a good movie.  If you remove it from the baggage that comes along with the Super-man icon then the movie plays well.  If you like and expect all that baggage to be there then this movie may disappoint you.<br />The movie's only real short coming is the scene where his father (earth father) dies in the tornado.  That scene could have been cut out completely without effecting the story, and it would have made it a better movie.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Easy reading and a nice story! Predictable story line and a beginning but picked up pace and I enjoyed the book.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|Very interesting. Lots of great info, but one particularly interesting fact. A man made cave in mount bear in Amherst, just a 1/4 mild down the road from Hampshire College was going to be one of the 4 command sites for the entire United States if DC was destroyed in the early stages of a nuclear war. Cooper tells me that spot is now used for archives.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I love this movie and all the characters.  I am of the characters' age but my children and grandchildren also enjoyed it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the series it combines history, drama, a strong story line and great acting.  I highly recommend watching the entire series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not stop reading. this book.  I d9n't usually read science fiction but this was extremely engrossing.  If one reads Wool, Dust and Shift should always be read.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|Jason Isaacs once again proves himself to be one of Britain's most versatile performers. The series employs solid storylines and totally believable characters.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Good, but not nearly as good as the others in the series. Are you kidding me there is a minimum word limit to rate a product - shame on you Amazon.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is an eye opening book that just makes sense! Who would have guessed that the very item that you think is so healthy is making you fat, hypertensive and diabetic. If you have ever tried to lose weight and failed miserably, this book is the answer.
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|I enjoyed the historical novel aspect, but it is too long and too clever. The astrology sits on top without any discernible relationship to story or character development. Editing required for a few errors ( eg taking an evening stroll from Dunedin to Port Chalmers) and the odd anachronistic turn of phrase . All made it difficult to be involved in the story.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Loved it!  I like Ms. Tartt's style of writing.  I recommend both this book and The Little Friend.  Quite captivating.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book. Lots of goat-people (satyrs)and half-bloods. Don't know about gods? I wouldn't buy this book if that's your case. A real eBook treasure!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was truly one of the best books I have ever read. The plot twist on this book is very clever.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids absolutely love this game. It is worth the money to keep them interested. It is also versatile with all my android devices.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Jethro Tull is the King of Progressive Rock!  I have most of his music and I have been listening to him since the seventies.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good read. Quick and exciting.  Likable characters. Smooth sequel to a time to kill.  Had trouble putting the book down
B000YMM3CC|4.0|It was a good movie to watch. If you like love movies then watch this one. It was good to watch.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Sound quality is great, but the battery isn't fantastic.<br /><br />With the Logitech G700 mouse, when it's plugged in with USB, it actually sends data through the USB connection rather than the wireless one. I wish they implemented that with this product, because the sound drops every once in a while, especially if there's a lot of other stuff transmitting in the area. Not often enough to be a real issue, but it's still annoying.<br /><br />I've been using it for a few months, now, and they are still holding up very well and are quite comfortable even after long periods of use.
B009AMANBA|4.0|This is an historic masterpiece, in both the literal and cinematic sense.  Its recreation of the period is impeccable; as well as its portrayal of Lincoln's political grit - his common, down-home talent for frontier mud-wrestling - in order to realize the loftiest of ideals.  I do agree that the film is overly-long.  Spielberg self-consciously created an epic, and succumbed to the tempation of padding to justify said status.  A half hour of extraneous material could have been cut leaving a tighter (and just as epic) story.<br /><br />In making the film palatable to a post-civil rights audience of the 21st century, portions of the story were rendered rather unbelievable, such as the opening straightforward dialogue between black troopers and their commander-in-chief.  Missing, too, was the full scope of intrigue behind the Emancipation: to ward off British recognition of the Confederacy, and revive the flagging Union war effort that seemed headed for an armistice.  Lincoln firmly believed that a no-nonsense military and political victory over the Confederacy was necessary to reweld the Union.  And yet, the Proclamation freed not a single slave, as he knew to be the case.  It did not apply to those slave states which had not seceded; nor could it apply to those in rebellion, until after their surrender.  Such is why the Emancipation is celebrated on \\"Juneteenth,\\" for June 19, 1865.<br /><br />This sequence is lost in this film, which prefers a straightforward moral narrative elevating Lincoln to the god-like stature of his Memorial, and us left to ponder the ultimate cosmic goodness of the American Vision.  While the narrative is, instead, unabashed propaganda, it is good propaganda, and deserves credit for its artistic form and forgiveness for its historical license.
0316743003|5.0|A fascinating account of the creation of some of the coolest technology the world has ever seen.<br /><br />There are sections written by many different people- designers, pilots, test pilots - all have great stories to tell.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I don't like it, i can't understand what is doing. Can I return it? it talk all at on time, I don't know what to do with this game.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This well-researched film, made by Oliver Stone in 1991, portrays the attempts by Jim Garrison, New Orleans Attorney General, to break through the official government story of the death of John F Kennedy. For people who want to learn more, an excellent book that updates the research is JFK and the Unspeakable. Both are powerful and disturbing, and they bring to mind the more recent lies told to the American people about 9/11.
B00F91H666|4.0|I did enjoy this movie.  Not one of those that has to see Brad Pitt no matter what but I thought he was great.  One of the better zombie movies.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I discovered this game about three weeks ago and love it.  I have it on my Samsung Galaxy 3 and on my Kindle Fire HDX.  I must first say that I have had to uninstall and reinstall it on my Galaxy because only half of the graphics worked and the others were just silhouettes.  Now with the reinstall, the graphics are great.  However, it is very slow, as if it is in slow motion.  The candies drop and shift position at a snail's pace.<br /><br />Additionally, on my Kindle Fire HDX, it worked great for a week.  Today, I went to play it and it isn't responding.  It is just frozen.  Upon reboot, still the same.  I had to uninstall and reinstall which not only lost all of my completed levels but it is still not right .  It now is  not frozen but it takes about twenty to twenty-five seconds to respond to any moves.  And it is not keeping my levels, causing me to keep repeating the same completed level over and over.  Very frustrating.  I guess I can't play it anymore. Very disappointing.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I've been using this on my keychain for months now and it keeps working.  I am constantly swapping out cards and it takes a beating on my keychain, but still working.  The metal ring on the string broke off, but luckily I seen it and just tied the string on my keychain.  Can't beat it for the price.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Orders are always charged but not always delivered to the device.  Trying to process refunds is very difficult.  The game becomes buggy after level 55.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILER ALERT!! Super disappointed. It felt like the author was ready to be done with the series or that the author was going through something and it translated into her work. I realize that not every story has to end like a Jane Austen novel, but with some clever twisting she could have saved Tris. It was a bummer and I feel duped.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|The first two books were great. This one was slow and had a lazy end to what started as a great series.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|I really enjoy how the Thor character was adapted for the big screen. I admit I didn’t know much about this character prior to seeing him in the movies, but my impression was most elements about him were very magical in nature. In the movies they use the famous science fiction trope of magic simply being sufficiently advanced technology. I think this was a wise decision as it better connects this character to the rest of the Marvel universe which has a much more science fiction feel (the Iron Man suit, gamma radiation and the Hulk, etc.) Rather than being a God from the fantasy world of Asgard, he is really more of an alien from another dimension.  Likewise, his powers and those of his adversaries are really examples of high technology, which to us mere mortals of Earth seem like magic.<br /><br />Chris Hemsworth was a perfect choice for the casting of Thor. Not only does he perfectly fill out the role of muscled Viking warrior, but he does a great job of taking the character from arrogance, to humility, and finally to redemption. The supporting cast likewise did an excellent job. The humorous moments provided a nice balance to the action and turmoil, without ever feeling campy.<br /><br />The story itself wasn’t quite as compelling as the first Iron Man, but was still a solid origin story and does a good job of setting up a lot of elements for the later movies (including the Avengers movie).
B00AEBBA5E|5.0|I love this movie. Was delivered quickly and professionally. De Niro is an amazing person and I wish to meet him sometime in the near future so he cal yell at me.
B000KIPT30|5.0|My Mom Loved This!!!  I researched several (well, many) approaches to help solve my family's problem of finding an acceptable TV volume to please everyone.  Mom has experienced hearing loss and could not enjoy her TV shows with others in the room (or would drive them out with the TV remote volume control!)  I found a review for the HA400 Amp that detailed the components to build a simple amplifier that did not have the inherent issues of the [super expensive] all-in-one portable TV amplifiers advertised by the late-night telemarketers.  So for around $80 (including a pricey-but-worth-it stenographer's headset) I shipped the components to Mom and she assembled it herself. The whole family is HAPPY with the solution (and there are still three amp channels for others who might want to boost their individual volume with a headset!)  GREAT bang for the buck!  (BTW - the HA400 is high quality, has smooth working controls, and looks like it is built to last.)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is an awesome film. The fact that it came on such a futuristic &#34;diskette&#34; makes me joyous that the future is indeed upon us. Now if only I could get it to work in my VCR...
B004EKCNMA|2.0|Even though the special effects were great, they changed the storyline too much - much more darker, and violent than any other Christmas Carol.
B009XI7RF6|3.0|Game is OK.  Slightly challenging, beautiful graphics, nice music. Just very repetitive.  I played about three levels before I got bored.  I do think it's a great game for kids ages 7-10 but can be a fair time waster for an adult.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great series! I can hardly wait for the next season to start! After watching three seasons, the characters in the story become people you know and either love or hate. When one of them dies in the story I almost feel the loss personally. Season Three ends with an accident that appears to take the life of a character I like. Now I am having a hard time waiting to find out if this character really did die. I hope not, but then again --- it is just a story! Everyone I have talked to, that watches this series, raves about it!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love the story and the actors.  It seems to get better each show.  It keeps me on the edge of my seat without violence and also gets into politics which I find interesting (the behind the scenes) and the interesting happenings in the law firm.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I agree with the other critics who did not like it.  There was so much more the author could have done.  I got half way into the book and was bored.  I will never pre-order a book again.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|So good I hated to have it end!  Funny and poignant!  I wish I could write like this.  Love, Love.
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Everyone in the world needs to watch this!  Claire Danes is outstanding -- I've heard Temple Grandin speak and I don't think I could tell the two of them apart.
B00000DQSZ|4.0|great music brings me back to the days of old and the dvd works great if you remember the 80's music and want to get back into it then this one is for you.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Love this movie, love the actors, love getting any movie I want without having to search for it at the store.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I very much enjoyed this game.  Starts off easy and gets harder as you go.  Played it for hours without stopping.  A keeper.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Don't start watching this or you'll get hooked. I don't even like watching tv but I was glued to this show.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Actors are perfect for the roles they play in this series. Episodes are fast paced and seem to always have an interesting twist in the plot.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Denzel never ceases to amaze me.  An intense study of addiction.  For the &#34;functioning alcoholic&#34;, may we all wake up.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Highly recommend this book to all! It is life changing and the way Sheryl Sandburg writes is very relatable and understandable!
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|This album is horrible, I can't even believe how many positive reviews I am seeing. I HATE the first 9 songs on this album, they kinda remind me of songs Yoko Ono would sing. It sounds like she was strung out when she made these. The last 6 songs of the album I love. I wish I could give a better review but I'm just so shocked and letdown by this album, The Fame, Fame Monster and Born This Way were amazing, this is just a train wreck.
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Very nice diver's chrono.  Sharp looks, excellent function, fit and finish.  Exceptional watch for the price.  Nice item for a variety of different after market straps too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|After switching to Android with the Nexus 4 from the iPhone 4, one of the biggest things I missed was AirPlay and Apple TV. I think Google finally heard us after the failed Nexus Q experiment. This thing is about the size of a USB stick but has some incredible functionality which I think adds some advantages over Apple TV.<br /><br />It doesn't have as many apps as Apple TV, but what it does allow you to do is use your device after you've initiated streaming something. For example, I fire up Netflix/YouTube on my phone or tablet and then choose what I want to watch, send it to Chromecast, and it starts streaming from the cloud. This allows me to use my phone or tablet while my TV streams the content I chose. Another great feature is streaming a tab from Chrome on your PC or Mac. I can share out any tab I want to replicate it on my TV. While I share that tab, I can open more and work on those while the shared tab is still displayed. This works pretty well but can definitely depend on your wireless network. I've seen some stuttering and lag when displaying some content, especially while scrolling. Having said that, it's definitely a killer feature of the thing. I have this hooked up to my Samsung Plasma and when I hit stream to Chromecast on my phone, it automatically switches the input to the Chromecast and starts playing my video.<br /><br />Did I mention the price? You're getting a lot of the same functionality as other streaming devices in something this small for a fraction of the cost. If you're thinking about getting this, definitely pull the trigger. You won't be disappointed.
B00756GRUE|5.0|Beautiful watch.  Rugged and handsome at the same time.  Excellent quality build - best part is it never needs a battery.  You get quartz accuracy powered by a solar cell.  No need for a watch winder or a battery change - simple exposure to any form of light is more than enough to keep it powered up.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Keeps you wanting to read to the end. You can feel he tension in the trial & it keeps you guessing who is going to win. The ending is good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great drama. Good read.  Can't wait for the continuation book.<br />I wonder if the world might turn out like this.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Doctor Sleep was a great read. Vintage Stephen King. Always wanted to know what happened to the characters in the Shining.
B00439MV42|5.0|Love it. It is pretty good movie . My son enjoyed too. But. You need to watch 1 & 2 first.<br />Probably, some people had different opinion. LOVE IT.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|The casting is superb and their acting is a joy to watch especially Emma Thompson and Liam Niesen.  The story lines merge well and although it ends sweetly and is totally Hollywood styled, it continues to make my eyes water and lift my spirits.
B000SEH80I|5.0|The author is very well versed in physical and psychological abuse, and you can tell through the chapters that she's put a lot if thought into using this book to help others.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I am addicted to this show and the wonderful characters.  I am looking forward to January for the next installments.
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|Highly exciting and complex movie with many disconnected and randon scenes that required to be ordered and put together systematically in order to fully understand the whole puzzle! Intellectually stimulating!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Love it!  John Grisham is my favorite writer and he did not disappoint with this story.  I'm always anxious to read his books when they first come out.  His characters and stories are so engaging.  The stories are intense and full of twists and turns but written so that they flow and everyone can keep up with it.  I love that he doesn't feel the need to use the vulgar language to get the point across.<br /><br />Another great book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My husband and I started to watch this show and can not stop anymore. We watch 2 episodes every night. We like it a lot.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, John Grisham writes another great book.  Very entertaining, never disappointing.  He is my favorite writer and I don't remember ever being disappointing with any of his books, and I have read almost all of them.  His characters come alive in your imagination and are so engaging that you can not help falling into the story.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|Amazing! Fabulous! She's back-finally! The albums got the sound of all her old stuff including the retro synthetic sound from the nineties.
B007X4ECMI|5.0|Love this movie! It keeps you on the edge of your seat and has a good ending! : - D
B007IQX1G4|3.0|It was okay. Not great, but not bad either. It was entertaining. I kept waiting for a little more. see
B005KDWUFA|5.0|My wife rated this one as a 5 Star because she is really an IL DIVO fan. I thought they were pretty good but the older ladies like my wife just go ga-ga over these guys. Older ladies would love anything by these guys. A good buy
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is one of my favorit authors. This is an interesting storry. It has many suprising turns and presents difficult problems.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|This was the BEST performance of any concert I have ever seen. Anyone that sings can get on stage & belt it out but George Michaels performance was REALLY a performance especially with all the light effects that were just over the top. He put a lot of effort into each performance he did. I would recommend this DVD to anyone that either likes George Michael or any outstanding performance that is 5 Star indeed. A terrific purchase well worth the small expense for 3 hours of performing.
B00499QUK2|4.0|I love the modernization while still leaving the original themes of Doyle. Very well done.  The episodes are a bit long and drag just a bit but not enough to lose your attention.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|In truth you can't do much with it. Maybe that will improve down the road. I think it could be kinda nice for a hotel room. Able to watch youtube or netflix on the screen.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book more than a year ago and I can't force myself to finish it. I'm not even halfway through. Seems like a 12 year old with kinky unrealistic fantasy wrote it. I could write better essays when I was in 4th grade. Terrible writing! Never buying another book from this author again. WORST BOOK EVER!!! Lame characters, too. I'm not watching the movie either. Waste of my precious dollar!
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Very fun and happy movie. We all love the music. It's one of the few movies I can enjoy with my Granddaughter over and over again. We actually had to purchase this as a second purchase. We wore out the first disc!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham is his usual solid self, providing another fun, entertaining novel with \\"The Racketeer.\\" The rogue element of good guy firmly entrenched in Gray area is in full effect here. A richly detailed plot and a likable protagonist ensure this is another winner for Grisham fans while potentially drawing new admirers as well.
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|I deleted this game, as it was just a trial of some sort.  You have to pay for the real game I guess
B005WGIJGE|5.0|Great toy for us Lego Batman fans.  The seller sold it at a 'reasonable' price for a toy that is out-of-stock at the Lego company.  It also arrived very quickly.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I love it.  It's a great way to open and work on files.  Easy to use and although there are limited fonts, etc. it does keep all formatting from files that you've emailed to yourself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about that they have the Kindle version.  I enjoy playing it this way. Bigger screen than the my phone.
B006IGZWB2|4.0|The film gives an impactful message of courage and hope for those who are humble. And a very touching ending. When it was done we were silent in our house for the next 30 minutes as we did things, but were all thinking about the message.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The puzzles are fun because you can choose the number of pieces.  However I wish there were more free puzzles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I played this game when it first came out to the app store<br />I can play it all day every day for years
B000MD9UJC|4.0|I really like this kit. The only complaints I have (I'm picky) are the cheap-feeling tail button (which you don't need to use), and the fact that the head only screws on part-way due to the LED taking up more room than the standard bulb. Otherwise a very worthwhile upgrade to the trusty mini-maglite.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|This is a great alternative storage pouch for the 7\\" Kindle Fire HDX if you're turned off by the outrageous price of the [[ASIN:B00DR0B432 Amazon Kindle Fire HDX Standing Leather Origami Case]]. I think the quality is exceptional and I love that the fit is firm and tight, without any wiggle room. While in the pouch, feel free to be as careless as you want with your Kindle Fire because I doubt any normal drop or tumble would be able to damage the screen. It's very nice quality.<br /><br />I purchased the \\"lime\\" color because it was on discount - presumably because it is the least popular. I actually love the color though. It's a little darker in person and actually very stylish. Even if all the colors were the same price, I'd probably pick Lime anyway. Highly recommended.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|While I haven't received my Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal yet, I've watched several reviews on it, and there's nothing to dislike about this product. Just know what you have: it sharpens MOST knives, not all. If you have a knife with a fatter angle than the standard 20-22 degrees, it may not put a sharp edge on it. Otherwise, a very useful tool, especially to throw in a survival or camping kit.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|All of Phillippa Gregory's books make history come alive.  Getting to know the women behind the thrones has made me a &#34;history lover&#34;.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Totally hooked ! Never disappoints. Can't find to many more shows that can even compare to how good TWD is.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Don't know how Ms. Gregory manages to keep these stories so interesting.  Feel like I'm beginning<br />to actually &#34;know&#34; these women of England's history.  Think I've read them all so far ... and enjoyed each one.  Wish my education instructors could have made history as interesting.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Doesn't really stream anything except utube, thought it would stream video from apple products, but it doesn't.<br />Not for me I'll stick with Apple TV.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Really enjoy this movie. The music is sweet and seeing Ryan Gosling is a bonus....I mean.......Manly stuff....driving fast cars and such. But Yeah great movie!
B00821OX98|5.0|It was an action series that I can get into.Graphics where great and all the actors and actresses whers great.I hope it come back.
B00942Y35S|5.0|Stories about loving yourself, flaws and all, are always a hit with me! Teenage girls, especially, could benefit from watching this movie!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Only works on small tvs, like a 19 inch too bad they don't tell you that in the description Too bad for me now I am out the money
B000GOU4M4|5.0|Classic...Was funny then and is just as funny now!  One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time!  If you haven't seen it, you're missin out.
B00CEF014E|5.0|This mystery thriller Solstice by Damion Stevenson, is fast paced from start to finish. To see Dana, depressed and willing to stay in the psych. center just because she was used to it after a couple of weeks, go from passive easy going youth into a terrifying experience, and come out a woman capable of protecting herself and someone else - at any cost - was a good experience. I recommend this book to anyone who likes thrillers, mysteries, or reading about people with enough nerve to overcome the unthinkable.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I'm 40 years old now and I still enjoy this movie! My wife and my two sons all love it, too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE IT, KEEP ME HAPPY ON DOCTOR APPT WAITING ROOM!!! IT KEEP MY MIND OFF NEGATIVE THINGS, STRESS KEP ME SMILING
B005544TRQ|5.0|THis is great TV drama with just the right hit of comedy.  I love all of the characters which give this show a great sense of entertainment.
B003Z49LYO|2.0|It was a very bleak view of this poor girl's life. If it had been something like The Bucaneers it wouldn't have been so bad but everything bad that could possibly happen to her does happen. I appreciate the alternate, and likely more realistic, less romanticized view of the time period but I would have liked ONE thing to go right in her life.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|The Bond of Bond's is Daniel Craig and I always knew M was a woman.  This story has it all.  The acting is so fine and the plot is rich.  007 fans everywhere have to love this piece of James Bond history.
B004VFOT4I|2.0|I like the movie.  Amazon streaming is what I didn't like about it.  The stream locked up half way through and never came back.  I was charged anyway.
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I think I was expecting so much more from this author and this book.  I found it incredibly redundant in the last half....pages pages were spent saying the very same thing - over and over and over again.  But I did walk away from it with one very compelling idea...so it wasn't a waste of my time.
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|Fast shipping! My kiddo really digs his music on the radio. Clean version is more age appropriate, but she doesnt like it quite as well.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|This album is  s***. No, it is beyond s*** to describe how horrible this album is. It sounds like she just through a bunch of lyrics on a bunch of premade tracks. There was no talent here what so ever. She even had the nerve to rip-off Bowie's voice. Don't send it straight to Hollywood, send her and her CD straight to the trash bin
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This app is a good way to learn how to play a piano and to have fun playing cool songs. Is I was to get a piano app, it would be this app Pianist HD Finger Tap Piano
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This is not a &#34;fluff&#34; book. There is no other way this story could end with such a damaged society.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I cannot say enough about this game. I just now got the opportunity to download it myself. I used to bug my little brothers about playing it, but now I don't have to. Anyway, this game is amazing.  The levels are challenging, the customization is awesome, and the soundtrack is the coolest! As I said, I used to bug my little brothers about playing this on their Kindles. However, my words don't do this game justice, so I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
B005UG542S|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. Glad it is on Amazon. Will definitely watch again. Wish it was on prime though
B00BAXFECK|5.0|What a wonderful book. I really couldn't put it down. So wonderful to learn so much about art while living the tragic life of a young man's struggles to understand the meaning of life and death and all that living requires. The loss of a beloved mother so young really changes the course of ones life. This book was beautifully written and very thought provoking.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive.  Don't start if you don't have time to play...it will make you late for any plans you have.
B00866H7SS|5.0|Read all three in the series, all are totally unputdownable books! (Is that a word?) Sylvia has a wonderful storytelling style, which keeps you captivated, and wanting more. I've enjoyed the Crossfire series much more than the Fifty Shades series, simply because the characters are all so well etched, and Eva is a strong, assertive woman who we can relate to. Waiting for book 4! Get it out already!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Awesome best app ever it is so helpful i can help u with everything. I have used it with homework i love this app. If u need help with with math ir anything . This is the app to do it. It has helped me alot. And it is FREE
B007KZY1YY|4.0|Loved the writing style, characterization, chemistry between Ana and Christian. But Ana could grow a spine! And Christian could treat her better, all the time, not just when it suits him. But all in all, a great read. I've read all three books in the trilogy, and hope E L takes their story further!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game can't put it down. Play it everyday some times all day. Grandson likes it also. He gets mad when I won't let him play.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great book disapointed by the ending. Her writing was fabulous.  All 3 books flowed well. Loved how Allegiant change perspectives.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great app i love how the horses are so realistic and how its very easy to get to the next level<br /> :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I still love my Google Chromecast and i want to know when will recibed an actualization of the app. Thanks
0062107313|2.0|What a slog!  Nearly 600 pages of plodding writing with unlikeable characters.  As a former Amy Tan fan, I was looking forward to this book, but I had to force myself through the pages.  Tan tells the stories of a mother and daughter in Shanghai at the beginning of the last century.  Unfortunately, the great majority of the book (400 pages) is the story of the less interesting (and more unlikeable) daughter.  I kept on reading only to get to the mother's story.  Tan excels at mini-stories, fables, and backstories of minor characters.  Whenever she launches into one of these, the writing is compelling.  Unfortunately, these mini-stories are few and far between.  I kept feeling that I had read a superior version of this book, and I realized that it was &#34;Memoirs of a Geisha&#34;.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Loving The Good Wife. I was looking for a series to watch in place of the TV wasteland offerings. It is well written, compelling and a good cast! I am enjoying the teasing I get from current TV promos for the show. Looking forward to seeing how things develop.
0884271536|5.0|What the great consultants can do that others cannot is provide a perspective that makes application and understanding simpler -- not more complicated. Goldratt's writing style, since my first exposure to his work in &#34;The Goal&#34; is of a remarkably clear-thinking view that is delivered in the form of very readable novels. We have all heard of &#34;bottlenecks&#34; and all have a clear idea of what that means -- but Goldratt made a science of the study of bottlenecks in our professional lives. As he expanded his views of the implications of bottlenecks we could find ourselves managing differently. As an example, we have all experienced the &#34;all-hands&#34; speech that explained we were behind in our work and we all needed to work harder to get back on track. What Goldratt taught us is that there is only one bottleneck at any given time, and that is the point that should receive focused management attention, not everyone in the organization. In a manufacturing facility, speeding everyone up means making excess inventory that cannot be used until the bottleneck catches up. It's a small thing with very relevant implications for managers.
B008JFUR10|5.0|This is a special-effects-fest!  The storyline is decent on this movie (sort of a Godzilla-esque story with better effects), but the real stars of the movie are the CG effects.  If you like massive creature, massive robots, and lots of epic-scale combat, this is the movie for you.  However, if you are expecting scientific plausibility, you are going to be disappointed.  This movie is big, action-packed and fun, but it is what it is, so relax and enjoy the flick!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|I am a Denzel Washington fan.  His performance in this movie is evidence of his acting capabilities.  Although I didn't like him very much, I could see the wounded person inside.  He was able to show that side of the character.
B001KL0WJW|4.0|It might be easy to dismiss this as a campy piece of 80s kitsch (though that itself is not at all a damning description), but it is such an amazing, realized vision of an urban fantasy, it remains as intriguing and incredible today as it must have been received at its release.  Even the most critical viewer will have to admit the influence that this film had on pop culture since, from early hip-hop style to Michael Jackson's videos for &#34;Beat It&#34; and &#34;Bad,&#34; any number of U.S. comics and Japanese manga and video games (including Rockstar's own 2006 console game interpretation of the film) to dystopian fictions depicting future tribal warlords.  Impressive mileage for a style-driven piece with as much in common with gay porn magazines as it does with Grandmaster Flash's Afro-futurism.  Can you dig it?
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The stories are really creative and draw you in along with characters that are very interesting.  I can't wait to start Season 2 and find out what else is going to happen.
B000HL09MG|1.0|Hated this one<br />Terrible<br />Poorly connected<br />To much skin not enough context<br />Avoid this movie as long as possible..skip it
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Liked this book so much more than the 4th in the series, which mostly seemed like people wandering around the countryside.  Perhaps because my favorite characters were featured more?  One could almost skip the 4th and move right on to this, without missing much.  Great story and can't wait for the next book to come out.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I'm not sure how they keep making fun and exciting Iron Man movies, but they do.  Robert Downey, Jr. is the perfect actor to play Tony Stark.  He is just arrogant and snarky enough, but he still has an inate like-ability that carries the character and gives one the feeling that he really doesn't think he's as awesome as he pretends he does.  And, of course, the special-effects in these movies is flawless.  It's hard to believe, but this movie has me looking forward to another Avengers, and an Iron Man four!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Makes a great case for why &#34;conventional wisdom&#34; on obesity is dead wrong, and killing millions of people every year. Definitely worth a read.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I have an eight month old baby who still gets up every three hours to nurse. Because I also suffered insomnia during my pregnancy, I have not had a full night of uninterrupted sleep since before last Christmas. Needless to say, in my life, sleep is precious. This book is so freaking good, I traded a whole night's sleep to savor it.<br /><br />I read the first few chapters about a week ago, and then life got away from me. Last night when I got up to feed my son the first of his many nocturnal snacks (the feeding I call &#34;elevensies&#34;), I picked up where I'd left off... and then I couldn't stop. The baby went back to sleep. I did not. I finished reading a little after 3:00 AM. Two hours after that, when O got up for his third and final feeding of the night, I was still awake, processing this beautiful book, still blown away by what I'd read.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is the story of two sixteen-year-olds who fall in love while riding the school bus. It's set in Omaha, Nebraska in 1986. Eleanor is a chubby redhead who dresses like a freak, not so much because of her own quirky fashion sense, but because her family doesn't have any money. She has a terrible home life: she the oldest of five children sharing a single bedroom in a tiny house, where there's never anything to eat but beans, no privacy, and all the kids and their mom walk on egg shells, trying not to set off their violent, abusive, alcoholic stepfather. As if life at home were not bad enough, she's also subject to relentless bullying at school. Park is good looking, popular, and from a much more stable home, but as the only Asian kid at school, he feels like an outsider, too. They fall in love over comic books and mix tapes.<br /><br />There were so many things I loved about this book. Much as I hate to say it, often in books where the hero is portrayed as gorgeous and the heroine is, well, not, it can be hard to see what he sees in her. Most books employing this trope solve that problem by either giving the heroine a makeover or by portraying her as having a warped self-image, so that the reader understands she's a lot more attractive than she thinks she is. On the one hand, the heroine is unattractive but she's fixable, or on the other, she's not unattractive, but she's too dumb or damaged to realize it. Both options have always struck me as annoying and antifeminist. Eleanor & Park doesn't take either path. Eleanor doesn't conform to traditional standards of beauty, and she dresses &#34;like a sad hobo clown.&#34; Park's mom gives her a makeover, but neither she nor Park thinks it makes her look any better than she does in her own, unpainted skin.<br /><br />Park loves her anyway, and Rainbow Rowell tells the story well enough that it isn't at all a mystery why. Park says she reads poetry &#34;like it was a living thing. Like something she was letting out. You couldn't look away from her as long as she was talking.&#34; (p. 38) He thinks holding her hand is &#34;like holding a butterfly. Or a heartbeat. Like holding something complete, and completely alive.&#34; (p. 71) He notes: &#34;Eleanor was right: She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn't supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel something.&#34; (p. 164) Quite simply, Eleanor gives Park All The Feels.<br /><br />I love the intensity of their relationship. I read another review that compared it to Insta-love, but I disagree. First, they don't fall in love instantly. For the first several months of their acquaintance, they don't even talk to each other. Park worries about what associating with the weird New Girl will do to his popularity. Eleanor thinks of him as &#34;that stupid Asian kid.&#34; But when they do fall in love, they fall hard. I remember back twenty years to my own high school romance, and I fell just as hard, just as fast, without nearly as much need to be rescued from my loneliness as either Eleanor or Park have. Such is the nature of teenage love, I suspect.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the book is that their relationship is a bit one-sided. -Not in level of attraction or depth of feeling or reliance on the other -- in all of these things, they are well matched -- but Eleanor doesn't seem to give quite as much to the relationship. She doesn't have nearly as much faith in Park and in their future as Park has, and while I totally understand why--(her own mother gave her away for a year for arguing with her stepfather, so of course she might have trust issues)--it made me sad. Park rescues Eleanor in an obvious, literal sense, and she is grateful, but I don't think Eleanor realized that she rescued Park just as much,  or that he might need her just as much, for less obvious reasons. Consequently, the ending really disappointed me, even though it felt organic to the story and believable and true, and maybe even necessary.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about the book is that their relationship is a bit one-sided. -Not in level of attraction or depth of feeling or reliance on the other -- in all of these things, they are well matched -- but Eleanor doesn't seem to give quite as much to the relationship.

B00ENXBUR2|2.0|Save yourself some money. Get this version instead:<br />[[ASIN:B00DYEN5QU Steel Blu ray UltraViolet Combo Pack]]<br /><br />I paid an extra $20 for a cheap collector tin (which is so poorly rendered,  I wouldn't display) and an acrylic stand that shattered when I attempted assembly. Deeply disappointing. Pretty much done with buying Warner product. Between Ultraviolet and crap collector editions, I'm done.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Amazon includes the first two seasons and then your hooked.... Enough to pay for season three?<br />Not so far, yet.
B00BN1QV0S|5.0|What a singular freshness, what an electrifying verve, what an unbelievable colourfulmess! Abbado is undoubtedly one of the best conductors alive. Enjoy these crisp, tangible Deutsche Grammophon recordings.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|Watchable and suspenseful, but I didn't really feel invested in the characters.  This movie covers a lot of ground in a short time, so the character development is a bit lacking.  Walking dead movies really need characters that you can relate to in order to really build suspense and give the feeling of desperation the genre needs to make the viewer feel the emotions of the characters.  The problem may lie in the scope of the story - too much to tell in too-short a time.  I think Brad Pitt is a good actor, but maybe not the right one for this movie.  In my opinion he is not really easy to relate to emotionally.  Still worth watching, but not as great as it could have been.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Best game I've bought in a long time. My only complaint is I wish they offered better hints or partial solutions so you don't to just give up if you can't figure it out. Well designed with attractive graphics.
1451666179|4.0|I've been following Allie's blog for years. I waited through her long, long hiatus while she was coping with depression, and I was thrilled when she came back and announced she was publishing a book. I preordered this months ago, and it did not disappoint. It's perfect.<br /><br />&#34;If it's so perfect, why only four stars?&#34; you ask.<br /><br />Well, because I'm a selfish, petty person. Intellectually, I love that Allie is so open about her battle with depression. I know there are thousands of people out there who suffer from (or live with or love someone who suffers from) depression, and these people will be educated, uplifted, and comforted by her story. I know that her comics about her struggles are easily the most important stuff she's ever written. I just don't find them as entertaining as her older stuff. That's my fault, not hers.
0452282152|3.0|This is an enjoyable story, but the author has missed the point of the painting: that a woman with no hair can be beautiful.  If you look closely at the painting you can see she has no eyelashes, no eyebrows, and there is no bulk under her head scarves.  She probably has alopecia areata.<br />Another beautiful lady with alopecia areata, Angelica Galindez, recently entered the Miss Philippines Earth beauty contest.  When she applied for the pageant she sent in a photo of herself in a wig.  But she got the organizers' approval to compete without the wig, completely bald.  And she won.  (Cf. The Week, November 15, 2013.)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was terrible.  It felt, throughout the entire book, as if a different author had written this as opposed to the first two books in the trilogy.  The writing was amateur, the storyline convoluted, her understanding of basic biology and genetics laughable, and it had a disappointing end to what could have been a wonderful story (though my disappointment is not what other's are angry about - it's more the lack of a &#34;conclusion&#34; that bothers me).  Because the final book is so terrible, I am not only refusing to recommend it to people, I'm contacting those that I had recommended the first two books to and letting them know not to bother.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Too many character to identify and follow.  A lot of lawyer babble which just served as filler  As always a surprise ending.
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|The critics gave this movie a lot of grief, but it is a really great movie!  Plenty of action and excitement, good acting, suspense.  Also very good special effects.  I don't know why the critics always give Will Smith so much grief - he makes fun movies and his acting is always great.  See this movie!
B000ZINGIK|5.0|Roy Kan vocals on Twisted Mind is enough to make the CD a must own. Decent song and the best vocalist in metal on track 1 was enough to see me on this. Enjoyed whole CD but bought it for Roy Khan.
B003G4W49C|4.0|The book is better than the movie but isn't that the way it always stands.  Because the book was originally written as a novelette in1975 and revised as a novel in 1985 the future is a little dated but so right on it's amazing.  The book brings out the actual turmoil that Ender is going through.  In fact it makes all of the children more human.  When you realize that they range in age from 6 years to 12-14 it breaks your heart that there is not a childhood for them.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|A GOOD READ<br />Grisham at his storytelling best - plot twists, drama, character development, a VERY good read. Especially on the beach.
B00EI2Y4MQ|5.0|PanecalST Plus by Appsys is a great general calculator application that can calculate while checking formulas.  The calculator can also recall recent calculations.  I would definitely recommend this calculator application.
B0056TYT66|5.0|I just needed the extra SATA port, and have it hooked up to a slower HDD for media playback.  My drive won't get anywhere near the spec-speeds, so didn't even test them.  I dropped it in, connected a drive with the (1) included SATA cable, turned on the pc, and it just worked - plug and play.  IF there was a driver update (win7 x64 pro) required, it happened during first boot before I even thought to look.  The drive was visible & usable immediately.<br /><br />The only slightly odd thing is that the drive connected to this card showed up as &#34;drive 0&#34; in disk management - ahead of the drives connected to the SATA ports driven off the Z87 chipset in my mobo.<br /><br />I wanted a (1) reliable, (2) easy, (3) cheap solution to have &#34;too many&#34; drives inside my pc.  Five stars for (2) and (3).  It's only been 48 hours, so the jury is still out on (1), but I expect it to do great.  This is Oct 2013.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Great idea, sleek design. Unfortunatelly, just a couple of apps support it. Phone/Tablet - miniscule support, can't even see my picasa web photos. And local media, of course....  For now it's still hard to justify even at a $35 price tag, as there are many other ways to watch YouTube and Netflix. And it's very easy to loose control of Netflix, actually.  Hoped for more features/apps when i was buying...
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Think the story went on about two chapters too long. The final two chapters really didn't add anything to the story or leave enough of a cliff hanger for me to want another book. At some point let us imagine what happens next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting and fun. Sometimes, however, very frustrating. Play it all the time, that is, when I have some free time!
B00902S0IS|4.0|One of the golden years classics. I watched this movie the first time as a kid and still watch it from time to time.
140006922X|5.0|Historical writing at its very best.  This is a wonderful book. It is simultaneously entertaining, interesting and educational.  A must read for anybody interested in religious history
B00555X8OA|5.0|An extremely well written book that is worth reading for those who deal in any aspect of mediation, facilitation, Ombuds or human resources as it provides an excellent theoretical basis for many aspects of these communications.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved the book much better than the movie. Much better detail and an easy read. Can't wait to read the rest of the series
B007F0IXD4|5.0|Very good book to read for Halloween book club. Although it is a young reader's book - good for adults.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so fantastic. It tells you how to play the game when you first start, and it's excellent for when you have nothing to do.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|It's just a fun movie to watch. There are several 'big name' stars in it doing a less serious movie poking fun at scifi movies and TV series.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great book to end it all on.  Must admit I was getting tired of waiting for the next book.  Good book for whisper sync
B00C8S9VKM|3.0|&#34;One Summer&#34; contains very interesting information and insight about our country and its history that have significant meaning even in today's world.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the good stuff is interspersed with laundry list like historical facts that are hard to read.  Found myself skipping over these parts to get back to the story.
B002ZG9968|5.0|Very good movie!  If you like lighthearted romantic comedies, you'll enjoy it!  Some reviewers didn't care for it, but if you liked Jennifer Lopez's earlier romantic comedies, you'll like this one.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very much looking forward to this third book. I was rather disappointed. It seemed as though it was written by a completely different author. There were some parts I liked. I can see why some choices were made but I don't think they were executed well. Example: this book is written from two different character's perspectives. While I liked the idea, I found that the characters didn't each have a distinctive voice. If I put the book down mid chapter, I'd come back to it and would often be confused as to whose perspective I was reading. The arc of the climax was off too. It seemed to platue a lot and I found myself wondering &#34;wait, that was the big conflict?&#34;  I also think some characters had their story poorly ended. Some characters who deserved their story end &#34;with a bang&#34; rather went out &#34;with a whisper&#34;. If this had been the 1st or 2nd book in the series rather than the 3rd, I probably would not have read the rest of the series.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It was a lame wrap up of every character Sookie had ever mer. People were coming out of the wood work for a pointless cameo. Just because it's the last book doesn't mean we care what happened to every character.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|While I don't use it everyday, I do fine it very useful.  I also have an Apple TV.  It is comparable (minus the iTunes content and HBO Go).  But for $35, you really can't go wrong with this.  Using a phone or tablet as the remote is nice too.  The clever way it plugs in to the back of your TV's HDMI port and with a USB cable that also plugs into the back of your TV is genius; it is invisible.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|It was amazing to give and i love the movie anyway. So worth the money and it got to me the very next day!
B00DU74U74|3.0|I did like the movie , but of course I thought it would be hard for them to  make the book into a movie . I guess they did the best they can . I would def recommend watching it when you get a chance . I watched it on the plane and it kept me interested
B005NQ94KS|3.0|I was disappointed in it..  It's an interesting concept--showing the same day over the years in the lives of these two people--but it wasn't done well.  It moves so quickly that there's scant time to truly develop the characters or their relationship.
1603427244|5.0|I'll start by saying that I've been knitting for 2 and a half years now. I've made scarves, hats, &#34;gauntlets&#34;, throws, and now I'm up to sweaters and multi-piece patterns. Consistently, my greatest frustration has been with my edges, since they seem to roll, or not stretch correctly, or be too stretchy. So, I got this book to have a guide for when to use which technique(s) for casting on and binding off.<br /><br />I flipped through this book upon receiving it, and was immediately impressed with the sequential photos of the techniques. Within a few hours, I had grabbed a crochet hook and started a new cast-on technique for a scarf I was making. I found the instructions relatively easy to follow (I use the continental technique and am left-hand dominant, if that helps), and was extremely pleased with my initial attempt at following the instructions.<br /><br />Other &#34;likes&#34; - the size is somewhat smaller, so it can sit on the arm of my couch or my lap as I work the project; and it's spiral bound, so it lays flat and stays on the page I need.<br /><br />I'm very glad I have this book as a reference in my hobby room, and consider it an excellent choice.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|Exciting kids movie! Something is constantly happening! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|The characters are engaging and the storyline makes you eager to turn to the next  page.  The strength the main character develops throughout the novel provides the reader with an uplifting feeling by the conclusion.
B0027MJU00|1.0|I have not read this yet.  It is our Book Club selection for this month.  I ordered this book in before our Library  I have read other books by this author and look forward to reading this selection in the next week.
B00EHMG358|4.0|I love the Pendergast series and &#34;White Fire&#34; is another wonderful addition to it.<br /><br />The book revolves more around Pendergast's protégé, Corrie Swanson as she heads to an upper class ski resort in Colorado to work on her thesis. Her goal is to prove or disprove the story of miners killed by a man-eating grizzly when the town was a silver mining oasis. In the meantime there is a especially evil serial arsonist burning down million dollar homes and someone has targeted Corrie for investigating these deaths and wants to put a stop to her meddling. And did I mention it all ties into Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and a story told to him by Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />From an interesting beginning to a thrilling conclusion I feel you will enjoy this modern day Holmes & Watson.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Keeps me entertained... I don't like that the harder levels do not provide more lives... Takes too long to move forward
B0080CL0HM|2.0|The acting was good, but the animalistic nature of Pattinson in this movie was quite distasteful. It just felt as though the whole movie had been glazed with a sexual and greedy garbage juice.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The storyline kept me entranced.  Loved the Australian connection.  The time line confused me at first but finally I got the hang of it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I dont like being stuck for months on one level but im also not going to pay to get thru a level when i dont have the money.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Love this a lot.  All of the books in this series held me in rapt attention.  Loved the Characters.  I was saddened to learn that Mr. Larsson has passed away.  He was a great character builder and his plot kept me going.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I've been pondering how to write this review after finishing Allegiant several days ago. I was a big fan of the previous two books and like so many other reviewers I counted the days until the release...but I really messed up and read a spoiler I hadn't intended to read, so I read the book knowing the ending. At first I was shocked, HATED the idea of the outcome, but I was able to read the book with a different perspective. I concentrated more on plot and character development, looking more closely to clues as to why Ms. Roth chose this ending. And, people, it is her RIGHT as the author to do so. I wanted to join in and hate it and bash it like so many others but I find I really can't. So much of what made Tris tick was pleasing her parents and family. Family ties was a huge theme throughout the book, even with Tobias, Tori, Christina, Uriah....Time and time again Tris would &#34;hear&#34; her parents' advice in her head. Saving Caleb was the ultimate selfless expression of her love for him, her obligation...<br />I suspect Veronica Roth wanted to be remembered as the author who did NOT present us with a total happy ending..like Stephenie Myers did in Breaking Dawn, like Suzanne Collins did in Mocking Jay, like JK Rowling did with Harry Potter. But I feel like the shock ending only created the much needed drama that the mostly blah story line did not do. I sense she wanted to deliver a message to her YA audience about the hard knocks life presents you. But I also feel we readers could have been led to believe we had lost Tris, only to have her rehab out of sight and reappear....because we need those happy endings in our lives somewhere - what better place than in our dystopian/ fantasy series?<br />So I  and so many others won't have that comfortable feeling a happy ending brings. It was still a good read
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is great because if you want to know the exact amount you have left, it will tell you percentage wise. I have used this app many times on the road so it can tell me how long I have before I need to have it plugged in. It was free so why not try it and see if it works for you!
B001QOGYFO|4.0|Pretty good. Not quite what I was expecting in terms of the plot, as I think it could have been better. But definitely a solid movie. Worth watching.
B004IPPINW|1.0|The conclusion was so obvious from so early that one only kept reading in the vain hope that one was wrong!
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|It was fantastic. I am a HUGE Wizard of OZ fan and when this came out I thought it would be a remake but it wasn't. It is how OZ became OZ. After seeing this I wouldn't be upset if they did a remake of the Wizard of OZ as long as you have the same characters.
B000P12LWY|4.0|The Tudors have a fascination for me.  Henry and all  of his wives come to life before my eyes.<br /><br /> It is nice to see the actors and the places as it may have been.  The costumes are great as are the scenes.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham's Sycamore Row is like many of Grisham's early works, great. Best book he has written is a long time.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Loved it at the movies so when the price was right, I bought it.  Angelina was truly believable in this role.  I've watched this movie over and over again. If ever a movie needed a sequel, this one is it.  You go girl with your bad self.
B000PMFTCC|5.0|THE ARTISTS IN THIS DVD WERE THE VERY BEST OF THEIR TIME, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU READ ABOUT THEIR HISTORY, PAVAROTTI WAS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER, SHERRILL MILNES WAS A FARMER, AND NOW THEY ROSE TO THEIR PERSONAL BEST, AND THE BEST IN THE WORLD! GOD BLESS THEIR AMAZING SOULS!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much that I cant even take my eyes off of it so how do y'all like it because I love it
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I watched this movie with my parents when I was just a kid.  I still remember sitting on the couch with them and feeling the Holiday warmth.  This movie is wonderful.  Full of sentimentality and belief.  I love it and would recommend it to anyone who loves Christmas.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I love this.  This book held my interest to the very end.  His character development was excellent and the plot thickened.  IF I love a book, I select various actors to portray the people in the book in my own mind.  This one had Michael Douglas as the main man with a young Angelina Jolie as our Heroine.  Various other actors were added such as Michael Caine, Peter O'Toole, Merle Streep to name just a few.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|This album is a great addition to any Arctic Monkeys collection! All of the songs are good. All of them.
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|I cannot rate this app because it does not download properly. I have tried several avenues on my device, so it must be the app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game omg!!!!! sick graphics. the game is very easy to play the controls are easy. I really recomend it. really fun
0738711500|5.0|The images on the cards are stunning! I have had this deck for almost three years, and even after expanding my deck collection, this is still my favorite. The book gives detailed descriptions of each card meaning, making very easy for those experiencing Tarot for the first time.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great Series for entertainment - Availability on Amazon to these type of series makes the purchase of the Prime membership a very wise choice.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I loved the entire series.  Well written, well thought out.  The characters came alive for me.  Sorry to learn that<br />Mr. Larsson passed away after this was written.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game dunno why i waited so long to try it all my pals play it so get alot of x tra lives its good by me
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love this show! It is about so much more than zombies. Seeing how people act and adapt during the end of life as we know it has always intrigued me. No disappointments.
0316204366|1.0|Caveat: I am only 11% through but so far I find it a waste of time and disappointing. I loved Outliers. This feels like somewhat of a rehash... It's as if Gladwell's editor pressed him to release \\"something\\" new.<br />Buy with caution.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was like this book belonged to a different series. It was disjointed. Very disappointing end to the series and its ending was so abrupt.
B00EJOCB4G|4.0|My grandson is obsessed with anything Minecraft and Legos. He's loved and built Legos since he was three,  Because he is so precocious it is difficult to keep him occupied. The combination of Minecraft and Lego was just what he wanted. Now we need MORE of them. His friends (8-10 people) have &#34;played&#34; and collected for years. They have everything that was made. They are always looking on Amazon for the latest. Christmas will be achallenge because they have everything (including t shirts). Please keep me advised of all the recent and upcoming releases. Good job Amazon!
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I cannot find this in my Kindle.  I read this book and enjoyed it tremendously.  I will be checking the Cloud to determine if it is there.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great could not put it down love it as all ways his books re just to good to put down. Can,t wait for the next one.
B001O6W9QC|4.0|Classic comedy.  Robert Downey, Jr. at his best.  Hollywood satire at its finest.  Was well worth the second and third viewing.
B00CATSONE|3.0|The actual story about Tesla is well written and interesting.  However the beginning and end of the book are a bit too preachy for my tastes.  One saving grace is that this book is short.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|They don't make them like that anymore. Timeless, great entertainment .  The Mustang chase is the best, worth watching just for that.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Emeinem brings it!!! Awesome album! Only song that takes some getting used to is Berzerk, but he flows on all the songs and has really set the bar high with this album.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|I love this slicing game, even in the arcades. It is a lot of fun to try to get as high a score as possible swiping groups of fruits while avoiding bombs. This is the game touchscreens were made for! All the kids and adults in the family enjoy playing it.<br /><br />However, recently, it has been asking to connect to the internet. I'm not sure why. If we turn on the Wi-Fi, there is no issue. We are not logging in to any Facebook account, neither are we playing against anyone online. There are challenge levels, but we really don't care about them. However, those may be the reason for the internet connection. If so, I hope the developer removes the requirement that they be active. I prefer to play offline.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|While Diana writing story is emmaculate I think that each book in this series after outlander has not been as good.<br />I skipped quite a few sections because it just wasn't adding anything to my reading experience.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|I've read a lot of self-help books. I read them and move on without action. This book is different. Darren tells it straight when needed, adds stories to deliver his message. The book is easy to read but hard &#34;to do&#34; with his action steps.<br />You need to read this book...only if you want your dreams to turn into reality.
1451695195|5.0|This book is amazing!  I have bought this book for all of my family and friends.  It brought much peace and new belief in Heaven to those who had turned away from their faith. It brings much hope and wisdom in this confused and lost world we live in.  Enjoy!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Disappointing in every way possible. Roth talks about serums and how tris is immune and makes such a big deal about it and it never gets resolved
160059672X|5.0|I love Sherry Serafini's books.  She writes beautiful detail instructions with step by step diagrams and pictures.  I will buy every book this author writes.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|I like the twist on the &#34;Angry Birds&#34; type of game. I admit I was first expecting to get to see 1, 2, or 3 stars, but working toward completing the territory is a good challenge. I have read other reviews stating there are achievements in levels 2 and beyond, but I haven't gotten there yet.<br /><br /> I like trying to defeat the enemy with only one boulder, but at least to me, this isn't easy. Maybe with practice, it will seem that way. The really good news is that it is challenging, but not impossible. If you don't get it perfect by using only one boulder, you can still go on to the next stage. There do not seem to be any negatives to using more than one boulder.<br /><br />The graphics are cute animations, except for the fact the king is spending the entire game swinging his tongue. My boys found this hilarious. I didn't really care one way or another. However, take a look at the pics to decide for yourself if you find it offensive for your own kids.<br /><br />I also appreciate the lack of intrusive permissions. App developers need to know we want more games like this.<br /><br />The only real problem is that I didn't find an EXIT button. If it is in the game, it is well hidden, or at least, not intuitive. I had to use the Android button to exit on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Sycamore Row is in keeping with Grisham's knowledge of the legal professions excesses. He continues to explore segregation and discrimination of the post Civil War era. It may be overdone at bit too much, however.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Would rather just purchase game &amp; play the whole thing. Seems like a nickel &amp; dime you to death scheme.
B005DWBO0K|5.0|This is truly a classic.  To see how early filmmakers generated genuine thrills and apprehension without gore or CGI is a very worthwhile experience.  On top of that, it was done without any spoken dialogue.  A very different perspective on film making, when compared to today!  In many ways, it can be argued that this is the movie that created the entire horror genre.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It made me angry, and I hated the ending. It made me feel like reading the books was a waste.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Everything fit. I was worried that it was too small but it took the Sony 70-400 lens even extended, plus two other smaller lenses and the other odds and ends I wanted it to take. It is compact and looks and feels tough. Its inside can be configured in many different ways to accomodate different contents.
B00AWBNNAG|5.0|My son who is a huge Lego builder just loves it! Page by page building instructions. A must for any Lego-aholic!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am addicted to this game. I play it all the time. I play it on my kindle, phone and computer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Yes there are mistakes, yes she says oh my and holy crap too much, yes the English twang is everywhere but come on greatest love story, greatest banter, email exchanges are genius, and E L James was a true originator. She took a Contemporary Romance novel to new heights
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I can't say how much my granddaughter loves this movie, it was in great shape and very well used over and over.
0590259385|5.0|my twins love this book - has a great rhythm. its also easy on parents to read but also not get sick of (too quickly)
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|I first heard of Gillian Flynn from &#34;The Book Club&#34; TV show in Australia, I downloaded a sample of &#34;Dark Places&#34; and after reading it I bought all of her books! This is dark novel that you can't put down, the plot and characters are thoroughly engaging, especially the main character Libby Day. Flynn has been criticised for writing such unlikeable, dysfunctional women but it's refreshing too read a novel where men aren't the sole protagonists. This is an absorbing, well written novel that deserves to be read more than once.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|What can I say......it's Breaking Bad and I am sorry it's gone, but this is a great way to remember this great show!
B00E9A656K|3.0|shud b ezier 2 get diff cars<br />I'm not paying for it<br />u should just b able to use diff cars for free
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This was a disappointing conclusion. The plot seemed jumbled, certain details didn't make sense, and Tris's death was weak. I don't have a problem with her dying, but her death needed to be for a good reason. I feel like it was thrown in there for no other reason than shock factor.
B001XV3LSS|3.0|A lot of movie stars are in this one but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I truly enjoy candy crush.  I spend hours and hours playing.  Have to make myself put it away.  My Facebook friends help me with lives and extra moves.
B0069HCYWA|3.0|I've always been fascinated by Richard Branson and have always wanted to read this, expecting a fascinating insight into a global entrepreneur. The most rewarding aspects of the book for me were his drive from such an early age, his natural business acumen and his fearlessness in all aspects of his life. Where the book suffers the most for me was the laborious conflict between Virgin Airlines and British Airways. It's interesting from the point of view of the underhand tricks of a huge company like BA, but it takes up too much space and seems to go on and on. Even the numerous accounts of Richard Branson's ballooning attempts all pale into one after a while. I found getting to the end of this book more and more laborious.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing! Could not put it down! Lots if unexpected twists and turns. Humour as well as suspence was a plus. A MUST read!
B001EC2IT4|4.0|I remember loving this movie when I was a young kid. It's still great today! I wish there were more movies done in the creative Beetlejuice universe.
1442362537|5.0|Collector of Stephen King's book on tape or CD's.  Did not have this one in my collections.  Hand to have it.  It was here within the week that I ordered it.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|This isn't as versatile as the iOS version. Doesn't have the sync ability like the iOS version, and there are better office products for Android.
0316322407|5.0|I felt it gave me a really good inside view of her life and struggles as a young woman growing up in a male dominated society.  I liked the amount of detail and I felt the author really captured her personality and spirit.  I would love to hear her speak in person.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This is one of the most original books I've ever read! The characters warrant little sympathy but are utterly compelling. I never guessed at the twists and turns that it takes and I loved the surprises. Gillian Flynn is my new favourite author and I hope the movie adaption of &#34;Gone Girl&#34; does this justice.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|If you loved the book, you'll love the movie. Great interpretation of the book. Spot on characters, beautiful special effects. So looking forward to next installment.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|This was not Denzel's best movie.  Started out well then became too predictable.  Good action scenes at beginning of movie.  HD quality was good.
B003Y5H53S|2.0|This was a strange movie for me.  I love animation, but this was different and the characters were strange.  I did not like the story either.  I gave it away, it was not one for my movie collection.
B00DHHWY9I|1.0|Horrible remake. And how many times do they need to make this movie over and over again? HORRIBLE REMAKE!! ZERO STARS
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Well I have a kindle already but I wanted a larger screen for reading my e books from kindle. I love the one click shopping it's great!!!
B005NACYQU|4.0|I've attempted two previous books by Neil Gaiman but never finished them, mainly because the narrative didn't engage me. I decided to buy this because of the anniversary edition and the reviews submitted which were all celebratory. Having finished it I can honestly say this is one of the best books I've read! It is highly original, the characters are genuinely absorbing, especially the main character Shadow who you root for from his first introduction. While the premise of ancient gods in modern America could have been surreal and fantastical, they are so integrated into the present that the novel plays more thriller than mythology. Neil Gaiman has created a masterpiece that deserves classic status.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As usual, this was just what I expected...so many twists and turns which add to the complexity of the plot and the WHY of its outcome. I did feel that some details were left unfinished.
B00BSW29OE|5.0|This is a book that I had read years ago.  We recently had the opportunity to visit Hiroshima so I reread the book before I went.  It is the story of the first use of atomic weapons on a civilian population.  The story is told through the eyes of six survivors.  The horrors that Hiroshima faced that day are beyond imagination.  The people knew that they were being targeted for regular bombing, but on that day only one plane flew overhead.  The people who saw it were surprised.  They thought it was a weather plane and then the bomb went off.  People in the center of the drop-site were vaporized.  People farther out suffered terrible burns and injuries.  The bomb was capricious with some of the survivors, killing someone who was sitting next to them, while leaving them alive.  It totally decimated the city of Hiroshima.  It is an amazing story of the horrors of war and the courage of the human spirit.  Hiroshima today is a city dedicated to peace and nuclear disarmament.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in history or the human story.  It is not a long book, but it will stay with you a long time.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|WOW, not what I expected at all.  I thought this movie would be tired, but what a surprise.  It was great and had so much of everything in it, from story line, action, fictional characters, love story and a very surprising ending.  This movie was and is great, it's in my movie collection to watch over and over again.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|Getting on the PCT for all the wrong reasons is how I would categorize this book. The author obviously had a lot of personal issues and seems to have embarked on this momentous hike on a whim.  Some things should be considered sacred . Her constant obsession with men, relationships and narrations about demented thoughts are so much in contrast with PCT is about- purity, calmness of mind and an incredibly beautiful experience.<br />2 stars only for PCT part.
0307454568|5.0|The Girl who kicked the hornet's nest is the grand finale of Stieg Larsson's trilogy. Till the very last word, it captures our interest giving the right amount of explanations at the right time, without being repetitive or leaving the readers outside of the story. We feel happy for having the drama coming to an end, but also sad for ourselves, readers, now orphans of the author's talented thrillers.
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|Disappointing.  Not nearly as good as the first two books. Also sad that she had to kill off Mark Darcy.  Totally unnecessary
B00FB6FOEU|4.0|Joan Jett, has always been someone who walks it like she talks it, and doesn't care hat anyone thinks. This album is no exception. Unvarnished is a good solid hard rocking effort, and stands up with anything else she has done. If you like Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, you'll like this one. My daughter recently discovered these guys, fell in love with them, and she is only 11. If this is your first time getting into her, take the plunge.
1451683405|5.0|Great little book. I have shared it with friends who think they have &#34;free will&#34; whatever that really is. After reading it they understand they really do not have &#34;free will&#34; and no such thing exists.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham is always such a good read.  Couldn't put it down and can't wait for his next book to come out.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Being a Zac Brown Band fan, I knew I couldn't go wrong buying this CD. It has several favorites in it. I like having it in CD format AND on my Kindle Fire!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is quite fun. It is a good level of difficultly so that you neither feel bored nor too frustrated.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Absolutely fell in love with this book, cannot wait for the third book to be released! Great book for any reader!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Just recently tried it for the first time. It is a good way for me to release stress. Play it a lot while hubby watches sports.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|For those who want something different please buy this movie. Original and a movie that actually makes you think.5 star rating.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|It was ok. Scarry enough, I guess. The plot was similar to other movies I've  seen before. If you like thrillers...this is a decent one.
B000X1T7MS|5.0|It allows a comparison of the tenets of Islam and Christianity, and shows the innate evil of the Koran, which has no consistent source or origin, other than the maneuverings of an evil man in the 700's.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show! Love it! I especially enjoy watching all two seasons back to back. Sad that season 3 is not available for free.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book was alright, nothing amazing.<br />I did like the supporting characters, Millard, Horace, etc.  But the two main characters weren't captivating enough for me.<br />I also got lost in the explanation of the time loops and how they worked.  But I did like the concept.<br />Although, I think that there a lot of issues that Jacob has to face in the present day and it seems like he's hiding out in the past.<br />Unfortunately, when I finished the book I didn't seem to care what ended up happening to them, so I will not be reading the next book in the series,
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Great book. Mostly practical advice. I would definitely recommend reading it to anyone who wants to live a richer life in general.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Either Walking dead or Hell on wheels IMO are the best shows on TV. I got rid of cable and will use services like this to get the shows I want.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Interesting and oddly compelling. Very satisfying to read. Gilbert regularly slapped away my hand that reached for a predictable resolution.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|Another good book, too many twists but still a good read. David has a knack for keeping you waiting fir the next turn of the page
B005LJK3AC|3.0|Charlie Day is pretty much the only thing that made this watchable for me.  I love Jason Bateman(via Arrested Development) but he seems wrongly used in this film.  Nothing surprising about the film. If you like humor thats meant to make you uncomfortable, this may be a good film for you.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Don't want to spoil it for you, but I want to explain why this album really spits some hot truth.<br /><br />It has quite a strange arc, flying out the gate with the mariachi-robot-Wizard of Oz ode \\"Aura\\" that asks -- threatens -- you to take a peek behind the curtain of the Gaga experience.<br /><br />Then it spends the majority of the album showing you more curtains.<br /><br />Lady Gaga takes two gambits. The first is defining \\"Artpop\\" as any work where a creator pours themselves into the piece, then shapes it into a pop object that a wide audience can understand immediately. The Greek statuary thing is kind of a distraction, but then again, maybe not. The Greek gods were just human beings projecting their deepest fantasies onto an unfathomable frontier so they could wrap their minds around it. That sounds a lot like the basis for pop culture.<br /><br />The other gambit is to make the woman behind the curtain an anticlimax, which is to say, she's pretty much what you thought she was all along: an entertainer who likes singing and wearing wigs to make you dream and be happy.<br /><br />ARTPOP moves through sex, anger, contradiction, joy, laughter, terror, and beauty. Even it's shallowest, that reality check inches ever closer to sock your face into the final leg of the album.<br /><br />\\"Dope\\" is a good song, but it becomes great because of its placement. Just like in real life, your best days come after you master that very grown-up magic trick of liberating yourself from your worst impulses by embracing them. Drug addiction doesn't count, and yet, the sun really begins to shine only after you hit bottom.<br /><br />So where does that leave you? The answer isn't easy; we're all working on one. That's why I give this album 5 stars.<br /><br />Chock full of hooks. (\\"Venus\\" has an absolute thunderstorm of a chorus.) In an odd way, a perfect album for the holidays. Can't wait to go home and sip hot chocolate with the fam with ARTPOP pounding on the sound system.<br/><br />Best taken in as an unbroken, 1-hour ride. Each song gains its identity by the song that comes before and after it.<br /><br />10/10
B000QQRXF8|5.0|Great album.  Classic Buddy Guy.  Kind of short, but worth the discount price easily.  Great guitar album for inspiring players.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not as good as the first two books in the series. Felt like the book was written in a rush and so hated the ending!
B000FBJGKO|4.0|Very satisfying. Told with modesty, subtlety and care. Very immersing without sensationalism. Writing was careful allowing you oly the perspective of the first person narrator in all her isolation. Very moving.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie with the new Bond showing what he can do. Not as good as Casino Royal but still better then the one after that.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Star Trek continuity issues aside, this film is excellent.  Super entertaining and Cumberbatch steals the show.  I appreciate what they were trying to do resurrecting the Kahn story line, but it probably would have been better as a new character line. If you like action, adventure, people arguing in space, and lens flare this is the film for you.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Loved every minute  of it, I wanted it to keep going on and on and on. Not disappointing in the least.
B00ECUARO8|1.0|Worst movie I have ever seen Matthew McConaghey in. Very dull and unrealistic. I was very disappointed. I almost turned the movie off. I would definitely not reccomend this to anyone.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! You won't be able to put it down. Amazing from start to finish!
B005LLSZNM|3.0|the season ending was disappointing after the teaser that big change in SOA leadership was coming. I may feel differently in Season 5 but the plot has become more than a bit redundant.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|I gave Fangirl 4.5 Stars<br /><br />I picked up a copy of Fangirl while it was on sale. I'm so glad I did. It's worth the full price, if you're a fangirl like I am. Over the years, I've obsessed about fictional characters from television shows. I could count all of my obsessions, but the point is, I could easily connect with the characters. Even though Wren and Cather aren't exactly like me, I could see myself in them. Especially in Cather. Starting her freshman year of college, it brought back so many memories. It was when I ventured into writing fan fiction online with friends. It was a fun time, it was nice to reminisce about it.<br /><br />I also found it easy to fall in love with so many characters in Fangirl. There is something about Levi that just makes him irresistible. For awhile I didn't know if she would choose Nick or what would become of him. There were so many scenes that weren't just believable but real. Things that easily happen to shy girls, the ones that tend to write fan fiction and have lives devoted to television shows or in this case books. It's easy to relate if you've ever experienced the fangirl feeling towards a fictional character. If you're ever written fan fiction, you know the feeling.<br /><br />So why 4.5 stars? I wanted to give it 5 stars and if I'd have connected with the fictional book she'd created as well as the fictional fan fiction (confusing much?) maybe I would have. Let's just say, Simon Snow didn't really do it for me. About 70 percent through the story, I started skipping the fan fiction chapters. I just didn't care about them. I know I should have kept reading but I didn't feel like it hurt the story by just skipping over.<br /><br />Truth is, it really doesn't matter. I loved the book. I'd recommend it to anyone that knows and has experienced a fandom (from television, books, movies, it doesn't matter). If you're into contemporary novels and romance you'll probably like it too.<br /><br />Oh and I lived in Omaha for a year and a half after college. I've been to Lincoln. Again with the reminiscing. I just - I really really liked Fangirl.ar and a half after college. I've been to Lincoln. Again with the reminiscing. I just - I really really liked Fangirl.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This is the most under rated and misunderstood movie of all time. It is complex, full of messages and themes that demand the viewers full attention for 3 hours. It is an emotional ride that builds to the end where all six stories come together. I've watched this movie more than 40 times now, and Cloud Atlas is my all time favorite. It is the only movie that I can watch more than once a year, and even though I've nearly memorized the dialog, it continues to tear me to shreds emotionally.<br /><br />If you are a hard core Christian, you may find it less interesting as it definitely has a Buddhist take on the universe, although Buddhism is never mentioned. The extra's on the blue ray make it worth it.<br /><br />Be forewarned, it has elements of slavery, a violent whipping, murder and attempted poisoning, gay love, cloning, prison, mass industrialized slaughter, cannibalism, suicide, and death, and yet is about none of those things. It is the journey of a single soul as it moves through six individual lives spanning 500 years. Life, Death, Rebirth.<br /><br />&#34;Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness we birth our future.&#34;  Sonmi 451<br /><br />The dialog reveals a philosophy you can base a life around. If I had only one movie to take with me for all time, Cloud Atlas is it.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|us Zombie movie, what else is there to say?? Just wished i would have got it on sale but still awsome
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The story developed well in the beginning.  However, the ending felt rushed and lost the intrigue that it opened with.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|An excellent film, at least if you can get over the constant lens flares. A surprisingly great sequel with the obligatory references to the original series.
1449410243|5.0|if you've ever had a cat, this book is hilarious.  the poster inside is of &#34;how to tell if your cat....&#34; which is the funniest part to me.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD ITS SO GREAT . I HAAVE BEEN WAN'TING TO GET IT AND FINALLY HAVE . ITS A GREAT PIECE BY HIM. YOU WON'T BE DIS COURAGED AT ALL.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|The book was great, but the film just barely followed the theme and lost most of the interesting ideas and drama, replacing drama with scenes meant to frighten the audience.
B007N85POS|5.0|This game has been the most fun. I have a hard time putting my kindle away for the night. It's great for kids or Adults. I'm a Grandmother! Good to read how to play the game before you start so you can learn how each bird has powers.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The final chapter is such a surprise.  Who would have thought that the one missing character you know absolutely nothing about would enlighten the reader and put closure on a dead mans life
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Can't stop listening to it! Its just a great and fun listen all around. Was strangely elated when I heard the reference to Sun Ra (the opening line of the song no less) on track two, Venus...there is something a bit Sun Ra ish about the way Gaga pronounces Jupiter on that one too. Track one, Aura, feels like Gaga by way of the Residents also, but that could just be my ears reading a smell not meant to be tasted.
B0052QXAEK|5.0|Good story and great acting! It keeps your interest. Has a lot of action. Keeps you guessing. Keeps you anxious for more.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT CD ITS NOT NOISY ITS QUITE MUSIC PEACEFUL MUSIC. NICE TO LISTEN TO. YOU WONT BE LET DOWN IF YOU ORDER IT. I THINK YOU WILL LOVE IT AS MUCH AS MY FRIEND & I DO.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Roth made a choice to kill the main character. I am not a huge fan of how she ended the book. I feel like she could of had a much better outcome<br />If she wouldn't have killed tris. That's just my opinion. Very well written but terrible ending to such a great story line.
B003B02OOG|5.0|One of the best books of short stories I have ever read! Grisham at his best! The stories were interesting, some were humorous, some quite touching. I couldn't put it down, as I eagerly went from one incredible story to the next. The only problem with this book is I didn't want it to end!
0810994739|3.0|Bummer that even though it was used it was marked in great condition like new condition, but it has writing in it. Guess it won't be a Christmas gift after all. Unless its for the boy whose name is written in it.
B004GJYRA0|5.0|Looooove iiiiiiiit. This movie has everything going for it. The parts were played SO well and I could watch it every other day if I had time. Highly recommend this movie.
B005PK553C|5.0|Absolutely loved it! America horror story is my favorate tv series of all time! I missed a few episodes of season 2 I can't wait until is available to watch on prime for free!
B007M45PMU|5.0|This cd is another one thats also a great cd that i love to listen to. Its piecefull music not load & noisy. I think anyone ordering it won' tbe disapointed. i think they will enjoy it as much as i do.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I read the book prior to watching the movie. The book gave a very different outlook on what most zombie material is about. I thought that was interesting but this movie was just a cookie cutter zombie movie. Good but not great.
0451232852|5.0|Ken Follett so very eloquently has the ability to integrate fictional characters within a true historical setting and makes it so intriguing it's hard to put down. Can't wait to read books two and three.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|It is an easy and quick read, which was nice but not one of the nine experiments worked for me.  I did like the feeling of hope it gave me, so that is why I gave it a 3 instead of something lower.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is a great story I found it hard to put down once u started it. I am going back n reading the shining now a great author and always well written stories. Thanks Stephen ur . Appreciated
B003G4W49C|5.0|This updated edition is well written and moves along quickly. A good read for Sci Fi fans especially before the movie comes out.
B008NW67E0|5.0|MUMFORD & SONS IS ALSO AGREAT BAND I LOVE THERE MUSIC ITS ALSO PEACEFUL NOT NOISY. I THINK IF YOU ORDER IT YOU WON'T BE LET DOWN.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Nothing can top 'Salem's Lot\\" but Doctor Sleep reads like the old Stephen King; fear, fantasy, a good moral and lessons to be learned from children. And, as always, evil for it's own sake.<br /><br />Stephen, don't write fast, write good!<br /><br />B J Salge<br />SF
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|Daughter loves it. Has her younger siblings dancing to it...funny to watch. And why do I have to add more words to submit review?
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Abrams and crew know how to blend humor, tension, and dramatic integrity into a thoroughly unique story, and the deeply rooted science-fiction base in Fringe proves their creative usage of sources. We might just have another LOST on our hands, if it keeps up the chaotic, mentally explosive energy from the finale.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was expecting this book to be so much better. It was a disappointment and I am sad I wasted money.
B0058W74UY|1.0|Tried this multiple times and it simply does not work. I was very disappointed. So much for Flash on the Kindle.
B006O5YIMQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, it'll make you appeticate your family and what you have. It's got hard times and good times
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Just bought, downloaded, and now reading my first selection from Amazon Kindle on my android phone (Galaxy S4). It's great to have it all in one place. The other books have transferred too. &#34;Purchase&#34; the Free app and you're ready to read. Love it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story, as is usual from John Grisham. Lawyer from earlier book A Time To Kill concerning a controversial will settlement.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Overall nice action movie but definitely not the best 007 movie i watch. There are bettet 007 movies out there
1446249182|5.0|If statistics and the thought of SPSS ever scared you- try this book! The author is fantastic, and will even provide a giggle or two along the way.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I always loved it on Facebook but there were a lot of issues so I had to quit playing it. I am so glad I tried it with my kindle because this format I have not had an issue with so far. It's a bit different but still a lot of fun. Thank you. Only one thing I would change. I would like to be able to see the people on my friends list who play castleville or actually play games. People who don't play games do not like getting random invites. I have recommended already to my close friends I know play games. Love this game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The way the stories and characters are intertwined is impressive. The time travel between the past and present are well balanced. Loved reading it!
B00FN811SY|5.0|Thanks for the most clear & understandable bible translation and reference to learn the truth from the Bible. Very easy to use and operates properly
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Where would I been without my Kindle plug!  The original cord became frayed and this has restored my reading pleasure.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not as interesting as the first two with a surprise twist at the end that made.me wish I had never read the series.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies! Just had to watch it for Halloween. I would definitely recommend it.
B00B5HQL50|4.0|Typical Bond ride. Great action, good nostalgia, unlikely bad guy doing unlikely things to MI6. Very unpredictable ending, doesn't fail to entertain.
1435107683|5.0|Have always loved this book.  Had it for my children and now my grandchildren.  Cute, sweet, funny and for small people - seems to totally engross them as they seem to really like &#34;Owl&#34; and identify with a lot of what 'He&#34; goes through.<br /><br />My 7 year old grand daughter now reads &#34;Owl&#34; to me in the evening. Too cute.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|underlying theme of human intel vs machines.  move makes it clear  no toys no gadets just action and acting back to basic bond
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Continuing the Divergent chronicle, this book is any easy read and the characters keep you turning the pages to see how they will meet each situation.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|Quite amazing! The whole interweaving of mystery with history, particularly of the gold mining/collecting and surrounding details, is an excellent vehicle for the story, which itself is quite absorbing. I only wish it had gone further and let me know what happened to her fascinating characters further down the road. Enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|A generic fantasy of an overly innocent women in modern society, with European fanciful sounding names and repeated predictable diction. Equivalent to an hbo sex story in creativity
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great Movie.  I think Danial Craig is the best bond so far and I have always been a huge Sean Connery fan but Craig is so much more athletic and realistic than the rest I just enjoy what he has done with Bond.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|The book is very descriptive and vivid. It feels as if you were in the story itself. If you are into these type of books, then it will definitely run your imagination run wild.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I bought this cd cause I wanted too annoy my kids mom she doesn't like the new lead singer, but I am not like that especially since I am AC/DC fan. It turned into a great buy for me.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At first I was baffled by the writing style, but by the second chapter I was hooked.  An intriguing look at Nazi Germany
6304806418|5.0|I am not a Madonna fan, but in this musical she gives a great performance.  This proves she CAN sing without screaming!
B009MFHFP2|5.0|It's great! Ben Harper is my favorite and there are some awesome versions of some familiar songs on this album.
B008Q1T1IW|5.0|Fantastic movie!  I watched it than made my wife and daughter watch it with me because I enjoyed it so much.  They both loved it also.  My daughter went and bought the sound track to it she liked it so much.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Honestly? I think Lady Gaga's last album &#34;Born This Way&#34; was played like crazy in clubs worldwide...but her and everyone affiliated with the last album didn't know that was going to happen. This CD; ARTPOP is just as busy as the cover! It sounds like she went into this album with the INTENTIONS of having any random song pulled and played in a club. Idk...just the hype definitely outshines the actual music. Don't get me wrong I like Lady Gaga and some rights that she endorses...but, seriously, if you were as unique as you portray to be the music would also be more original. It sounds like what you would expect to hear in the club scene and overall a mess.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I heard this cd when it first came out it just took me forever to get it. It rocks and I love that it has extra songs on it.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Another game that wont let you stop and then start again.Was this made for a kindle? Maybe I just need a 3year.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Matthew McConaughey tears up the screen.  And he even manages to be sexy as low life &#34;bad boy.&#34;  The young actors were good as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you love sci fi, have not seen Firefly, and are looking for something with fresh concepts check this out. It's a combination of high tech, the wild west, and emotional drama all rolled into one. Kaylee is one of my favorite characters ever. After you've watched the show watch the movie Serenity, the watch it again. Serenity was much more action packed and aggressive (which I didn't like but a lot of people do), and it fills in a lot of the missing pieces allowing you to watch the series again with new perspective. You could watch Serenity first but I found it helpful to get to know the characters through the series first.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Such a fun album to listen to. My husband has been addicted to it over the past few weeks even since we saw Capital Cities live. If you have the chance to see them live, do it! They are excellent!
B004UID2LC|1.0|Product did not function as indicated in the description.  I was unable to download any videos from the internet.  Unless there is some secret to making it work, it was beyond my ability to get it to do what I wanted it to do.
B004A2V3K0|4.0|I listened to this band all threw my senior year in high school mostly at the dances. Reminds me of better times.lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very challenging but good when i succeed at one level and go on to another. can be fun challenging friends too
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book is not faithful to the characters, and Tris's death is pointless and unnecessary. The split POV is not well done at all, as the voices of Tris and Four are written so similar, which is a shame since the Four mini-books are generally very well written and true to Four. What a shame. I regret reading the series now.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Firefly was the best Sci Fi I have ever seen. I appreciated Serenity as a filler to give closure but didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the series. Considering the amount of info they had to pack into that movie to make it work for people who hadn't seen the series it was very well done, but I'm not much much of an &#34;action&#34; fan. I liked the humanity of Firefly and that was missing in the movie. The characters had so much depth to them and were so real. *Firefly Spoilers* In Firefly Mal has his harsh moments but you also see his tender side. In Serenity all you see is his harsh side. Book and Inara are practically slashed, and you don't get to see any of that hostility to friendship Firefly developed between them. Simon is practically a Rambo in the movie instead of his nurturing sensitive inhibited self that contrasts so much with Kaylees outgoing personality but very very slowly brought them together. If I had seen Serenity on its own I would not have enjoyed it. The movie also missed a lot of the culture that was woven into the series. If you love action packed movies you'll like this whether you've seen Firefly or not but I really think that in order to enjoy the movie to its fullest you have to see Firefly first.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I'd like to start by saying that I agree with most of the 1-2 star ratings that I've read on here and that I got the book on Audible and listened to it.<br /><br />WARNING, SPOILERS:<br /><br />I was quite anxious regarding the release of Allegiant since the first two books in the series were pretty good. About halfway through I realized that this installment wasn't nearly as interesting or involved as the previous two. Actually, to me it seemed like a completely different series. They're outside of the walls dealing with YET ANOTHER \\"villain\\" - the Bureau. Honestly, you get to a point in a series like this where there are just too many people/entities you're sort of supposed to hate. We've gone from Jeanine to Evelyn to the Bureau. Not to mention all the recurring side characters like Marcus, Peter and Eric, etc.<br /><br />Moving on, much has been said about the ending; deservedly so. I wasn't overly sad that Tris died as she wasn't really one of my favorite characters. What strikes me as odd, no...horrible...is that the entire series has been from her perspective until the final book. It makes absolutely zero sense to kill off your narrator. I'm unable to comprehend how Veronica Roth thought this was an appropriate ending. Honestly, it would have made more sense to kill off Four (which would have definitely evoked a higher emotional response from me anyways.) Instead of taking the easy way out, Four could've been killed in a conflict between Evelyn and Marcus thus causing them to come to a cease-fire (also more appropriate than Evelyn instantly agreeing to lay down arms.) Then you wouldn't have to kill off your main narrator. My point being that there was no point in killing Tris, especially since she survived the death serum.<br /><br />This book feels like a poor man's version of The Hunger Games. Roth tried to kill off characters to make a point, instead it seems like she made a point to alienate her readers. This book was a wholly unsatisfying ending to a perfectly decent young adult series. I think I speak for plenty of people when I say this:<br /><br />Ms. Roth and Harper Collins Publishing,<br /><br />I give you permission to pretend this version of Allegiant didn't happen and re-write the book. Please and thank you!<br /><br />Regards,<br />An Unsatisfied Reader
B008602KQI|5.0|Any movie that can get children actually thinking about being active in the outdoors and making them think about how good they really have it, rates highly with me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|my son plays this game all the time and can't get enough. i enjoy playing it as well lol. if your child is a despicable me fan, this game is a must have.
B009WUBERW|2.0|Not worth the time spent on it.  it was all the old guys who acted like they were on a trip together somewhere but were being filmed.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|On reflection, this novel was a love story. I still enjoyed the Stephen King style and strong characters.<br />The setting of the JFK era made for great reading.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a little confusing at first but I like the show me buttons. also the way the city functions is amazing. its a very good game. my five year old plays it with. me all the time
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, once you pick it up you will not be able to put it down.  I was captivated from the first page fell into each character and found self feeling as though I was right there with them on this journey.  I cannot wait to see what happens next in the movement.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|What a great cd.  I use it in my classroom to educate this younger generation to quality music.  I am glad my fifth grade students are being appreciative of all forms of music.
B006R6ZP6U|3.0|Not as bad as the reviews it got. Yes, it is a little confusing and all over the place, but not too disappointing.  The movie would have been worse if not for the efforts of Damon and Ledger.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't like games that you have to pay to play more of.  I would like to just keep on playing instead of having to wait when I run out of lives.  But I do enjoy this game.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Liane Moriarty's characters came to life on the page!  The women's stories were compelling and how they all connected together was so interesting.  I couldn't put the book down and as soon as I finished it, I bought WHAT ALICE FORGOT, another book by Liane Moriarty.
B00D2JDNQ4|3.0|Superbly written, eloquently written but convoluted and about 20 characters, each given an incredibly indepth psychological assessment and I frequently lost the plot because so much was written about what wasn't really important.  Would the book have been a lesser book had the author left out the description of a landscape painting in one of the character's office.  Minute detail that didn't really move the story along.  I don't like short stories, I much prefer a book with a lot to say but this book said a lot more than I felt was necessary even tho the writing was succinct and well worded.  I have to say it was a good book but I can't say I will recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect app.  I've used this quite a bit while being laid up from foot surgery.  I've had no problems with this app. and have enjoyed having something to keep me occupied.
0061537969|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. The artful way the story is narrated from the perspective of a pet dog is wonderful. This book stirs every emotion and is inspirational.
B0010T0OCY|3.0|Dark City is a pretty dark movie. I typically really like this type of movie, but this one got so dark that the happy ending, wasn't.
B00FJMK9VE|5.0|Stryper has still got it!  After how many years?  This album is so heavy and full of awesomeness.  Guitar solos galore, the lead singer's trademark high pitched yell, amazing drums, just fantastic overall.  I highly recommend this CD for anyone who wants to jam to something that is meaningful and amazing!
B003GXJ072|5.0|I really don't know what to say that hasn't already been said except the movie is even better @ 1080p and surround sound cranked with the lights off.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|How can you not love Downton Abbey?  Great characters, acting, story, residences and on top of all that - Maggie Smith.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very additive.  You can still feel the challenge even if stuck for days.  Fun to see friends progress too.  Would be nice to have a chat window.
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|Great movie.  Good story and wonderful acting.  Grabs you and holds your attention from the beginning to the end.  Heart felt.
B002KS1IJC|2.0|Sorry, I like James Caviezel, but this movie was boring and trite.  I felt like I was watching something written and directed by a 13 year old.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Once more Gillian Flynn writes a tight story about a family , telling each person's side of what happened leading up to the event. A very dark story with lots of dark places that people go. Great read!
B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|The game seemed interesting, but it was not working well on my Kindle. The game would keep exiting out of itself or completely freezing up my Kindle. It also takes up a LOT of your storage space.
B004YD1KTO|4.0|Interesting concept the way the story was developed.  Lupton is a good writer and this book is different and well done.
B005JABN8Y|5.0|because the model kit was delivered on time and parts of the model kit are exactly like the picture, except for some small details that can be improved if the person want to paint. thx.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|the movie is wonderful and the quality of the images were really good!<br />I hope to find more italian movies like this in the future.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I 'm not sure why this movie is getting all the bad reviews.  No this will never be a classic, an Oscar winner or considered &#34;The Best Movie Ever&#34;. I doubt it was ever meant to be. It is just a good, mindless entertainment. I'm not a huge fan of Jeff Bridges, but he was very entertaining in this movie.  Well done by a guy who is a rough neck from the old west who in actuality is a Hottie by those who see him. What's not funny about that? I can understand why this movie won't be for everyone (what movie is). I had some pretty good laughs out of it and what more could you ask for a movie that was never meant to be a box office smash.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books and have to rate this as one of his finest.  Could hardly put it down.
B00ES3X9Q2|4.0|This is a well done edition of a classic story.  I bought this version because it said it was illustrated.  I looked at it on two Kindles, an iPhone Kindle app, and my PC though and there are no illustrations other than the cover art.  So if the pictures are important to you, keep in mind that this edition takes a pretty liberal view of what it means to be &#34;illustrated.&#34;  Otherwise, it seemed to be well edited and I enjoyed reading it to my children.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel was a hot mess. He kept me on the edge of seat. I could not predict what he would do next.
B0042XA2U4|4.0|This is a really nice book, with some interesting ideas. I really enjoyed reading it and never wanted to put it down! Ending was slightly disappointing though.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I love sci-fi flicks and this is no exception--especially since it is set in the Alien/Aliens universe.  There were some plot-holes, and lack of depth to the story.  What saved the movie were the fact that it was well made, and the cast delivery.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham has brought back to life the characters from &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; and has created a fascinating and complex scenario for Jake Brigham to work his way through.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Great book and cant put it down. I would recommend reading the Percy Jackson series first though. I had to keep reading this series
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|This is a hard product for me to rate.  The bottle cutter itself is sturdy and well designed.  In implementation though I cannot get a clean break.  I get a clean line around about 90% or so of the bottles but then there is always a crack or other anomaly in the last half inch or so.  I think it is time to try again.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|it was amazing because It didn't freeze and had no glitches it was awesome and I love hunting that game is awesome
B003VANOFY|4.0|Would have given a 5 until usb broke in my hand last week but on bright side was able to purchase a replacement from Amazon.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Denzel Washington is superb, and so is John Goodman.  Although this is based on a true story, I never recall reading about it.  Well worth your time!
007174889X|5.0|I would highly recommend these to anyone who is going to be going into primary care, be it doctor or nurse.  These books are very thorough and I have used them extensively for case studies and for information about various diseases.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Although the writing was uneven at times, the story had me hooked from the very beginning. Of course there's the main question for the reader, did Jacob commit the murder? But then what makes the book excellent is that the reader has to figure out whether or not the other characters surrounding Jacob think he did it. And the result is probably not what you'd expect.
0142410314|4.0|My kids enjoyed it.  I still like the Gene Wilder movie better.  It was very hard for me to read the Oompa Loompa songs in the book because I kept trying to force them into the tune of the songs from the movie.
B00881VLCE|3.0|YEA PUZZLES  I like puzzles so this is great and the different levels is even better. I do hope they get the stalling and shifting fixed because that is annoying on any game.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|This game is a lot like Mario Brothers! Lot's of levels and hrs. of fun. My kids really enjoy playing this game.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Good series!! Last book had a lot of info in beginning. Took awhile to get into. But overall lots of action as always!!
0061537969|1.0|I know that I will be one of a tiny minority who hated this book & would have given it a minus star-rating if the system allowed, but here's my two-pence worth anyway! Had it not been for the fact that this was chosen by my book club, I would not have bothered to read beyond the first couple of pages.The plot is so utterly predictable that it positively clunks. None of the characters are fully developed and the author failed to engage my sympathy for any of them in any way. The dying dog-as-narrator became steadily more maudlin while the cod-philosophy and mini-lectures on the ins and outs of motor-racing became increasingly patronising in tone. The whole saga of family-relationships could have come straight from one of those dreadful American made-for-tv films shown on afternoon TV & best avoided even if you are stuck at home with a bad dose of 'flu. Garth Stein seems to have hit on a money-spinning formula which clearly tugs on the heart-strings of a wide-range of readers and good luck to him. Readers wishing to avoid sentimental codswallop are advised not to bother with this book. I wish I hadn't wasted precious time on it!
B00CO52NLI|2.0|My daughter likes it but keeps asking me to buy &#34;add ons&#34; like a horse or a dog. They should be able to earn these through play, not by me having to pay .99 here and there to make the game run smoothly.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Great read!!  Was over my head at times, but Dr. Perlmutter did a great job saying, &#34;what that means is...&#34;
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Excellent series!  A writer who breaks the rules of plot development... It makes for an unpredictable story line you will enjoy!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what I need it to do. I love the big screen and buttons. Very handy and it's a quick start up.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Very good Bond Film. Not quite as good as Casino Royale, but Javier Bardem as the villain gives an excellent performance and Daniel Craig puts up another excellent performance as Bond. Would recommend to any action fans.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Didn't see that one coming.  This one has a very good ending.  How he handled the situation was classic John Grisham.  Glad to visit with Jakes old friends also.
0451169514|5.0|excellent book! it really does gives you another perspective of the universe. came with one of the corners a bit folded but great
B001K3ENEA|4.0|I've actually owned two pairs of these things, and I have to say that in both periods of ownership, I've been excellent times with it. Comfy, loud, and very serviceable for the price. Unfortunately, on the second go 'round, I noticed that when 'natural' sounds go up against louder ones, the natural sounds lose every time, and get washed away in the noise. If you mostly listen to computer-created fare, this won't be as much of an issue, but if your kind of music mixes the two, it won't as pleasant an experience for you. Overall for the price, you're getting pretty good quality cans. I'd strongly recommend saving up for something a bit higher up the food chain, though. These are a long term investment, and you want to able to enjoy it in as many settings and as frequently as possible
B00FN811SY|1.0|Please add the app.  Would love to use it to study.  Works great on my iPhone & I love my Kindle but may have to change if it doesn't work.
B004SBULWE|5.0|Great! Easy to kill all the apps that are still open and taking up memory and space which allows my Kindle to run faster.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Very creepy, decent story. CGI effects are a little off, other than that, a good horror film. Excellent acting as well.
B005UG53NS|5.0|I am a BIG Harry Potter fan and have watched the movies with my grandsons more times than I can count. Just could not wait for the last in the series to be released and I was not disappointed. We as fans have followed Harry Potter for 10 years and feel that we know their characters on a personal level. I want to cry every time I watch this and realize that there will be &#34;no more&#34;.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Very well done. A bit Limey but well done. Loved the special effects and the true nature of the story.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|Just another generic &#34;reboot&#34;.  It would be nice if Hollywood would throw this kind of money behind an original idea.  The eye candy is worth a rental, I guess.
B0039USJMY|4.0|I ordered this movie for my dad, and he loves it.  He watches it quite frequently, in fact, and the music is great.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thought this was very historically accurate. It was a good picture of what orphan train children experienced. I enjoyed the story; it was fiction but based on a real story.  I thought the ending could have been happier, but that's how real life is,
B00EKWTLUO|1.0|Disclaimer: I did not watch the movie or listened to the entire soundttrack. And I'm an extremely discriminating music listener! But based on the samples I listened from Amazon this does not look like a four/five star work.<br /><br />Com'on....it sounds too simplistic guys! The kind you sit in front of a computer and mix in few minutes/hours. This does not deserve 4/5 stars. And for the tracks that sound a little complex you proably heard them a 100 times from the likes of John Wiliams/Hans Zimmer/Jame Howard etc. Nothing ground breaking guys! When you work on movie like Pacific Rim you need a little originality, a little bit of creativity and a little bit desire to give something new!! I haven't seen any of that in this album samples. And I don't have any desire to spend 10 bucks to try out the full sound tracks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book! From start to finish the banter between the two main characters is very well written! You go E L James!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|Boring story about a family fight over a will....Not his best work. Had to force myself to finish it and the ending was very predictable.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|It's an enjoyable movie with heart and fun. Rachel plays it so well. The studio just needed to get their marketing better.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|This movie version obviously doesn't match the book, which is much better, but I still like it.  If you can let go of the book plot, and watch the movie on its own merit, it's not that bad.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|It's pretty cool. Has some good sounds and some annoying ones. You just have to play with it to find out which ones are soothing to you
B000AGTPUU|5.0|The polar express movie is a hit with every age group.  My grandkids love it.  It has alot of adventures.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Lotta good music here. Lots of different styles. I think recovery  most the album was good. But this about half or a little more then half. But this album has a lot of songs so it breaks even I think.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great novel by John Grisham.  Once you start reading it you don't want to put it down.  You can almost visualize what his characters look like.  He is one of the best authors.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I love John Grisham so much and have read every book he has written but this is not his best work.  My love for him is getting this review three stars but it probably only deserves two.  It's old characters with nothing new to say.  Bad things happened in the south before civil rights but this story is not exciting or intense.  I think Grisham is more interested in politics than story telling at this time in his life.
B0060D3BWK|4.0|A babysitter introduced me to this years ago (early 2000s?) and it's been my own personal Halloween tradition ever since.  All the more special because I ONLY watch it on Halloween--or All Hallow's Eve...
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved the first two books of the series. Did not like this one. It seamed like it had no purpose.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Installed this app on my Kindle Fire and it messed it up. It kept freezing up and made other apps perform slowly.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|I enjoy this music way too much. Then again violins are awesome. Who can argue with violins and electronic or whatever this is called.
B00BEF1AEK|4.0|Similar reviews as the rest. Great game, simple and easy to use and learn. Music and fx not annoying. No intrusive permissions. I don't like to having to force close it though. A quit button would be nice, but its not the end of the world for it not to be there...
B0014GVCI8|5.0|Darling movie!  Smart, funny, touching.  Great acting.  Surprising as well.  Not smarmy!  Good story line with excellent dialogue.  I will watch it again.
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent show. Brings all the stories I grew up reading into the modern day. I discovered this by liking Cumberbatch in Star Trek and looking for other things that he did. I think Cumberbatch might be even better in this series.
B00G8YJWG0|5.0|At last, all the buildup of tension from 5 seasons of this series comes to a head, bursts open & explodes, careening alliances, relationships and loyalties all over the place. Things will never again be the same, and everything that we've come to know & rely on is up in the air.<br /><br />Alicia officially unites the knot---at work, and is set free. And that big moral Gordian knot she has inside her becomes looser, not due to her embracing a true moral code, but because she does the opposite and is now  driven by the most base motives, impulses exceeding those of even Will. The Good Wife becomes The Devil in a Red Dress.<br /><br />This is  truly the Edge-Of-Your-Seat TV watching!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Completing the full circle from start to now, this movie was fun and suspenseful at the same time, just like the entire Star Trek series..
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|Like the extended versions of the Lord of the Rings films, this edition adds back in footage which was deleted primarily to make the theatrical film shorter. But whereas each of the LOTR extended versions were 40 minutes to an hour longer than their theatrical counterparts, the extended edition lengthens The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey by only about 15 minutes. I’ll speculate this is because the relatively late decision to make the Hobbit into three rather than two movies meant there was less “leftover” material.<br /><br />I don’t like that there apparently isn’t a version which has both the Blue Ray and DVD extended editions together and so you have to choose one or the other. I also don’t like that unlike the LOTR extended editions, this set doesn’t include a chart telling you which scenes were added or extended.<br /><br />The only documentary included in this set is called “New Zealand: The Home of Middle Earth.” It’s basically a six-and-a-half minute travel promotion which shows how various places on the island nation were turned into parts of Tolkien’s Middle Earth. It includes an animated map and has various members of  the cast talking about the appeal of the country’s spectacular scenery. It’s actually entertaining, but it’s short.<br /><br />The best I can tell, the few totally new scenes added in this extended edition are mostly located at the start of each of the two disks the movie has been divided into for this set, although they’ve all been added to this presentation of the film in sequence of the story  rather than as a separate menu of “added scenes.” This means you have to watch the whole film to see the new stuff, but it also means you see it in context.<br /><br />Towards the beginning of the disk one, there’s a brief new scene where a very young Bilbo meets Gandalf. After the scene where adult Bilbo encounters Gandalf outside his front door, there’s a short new scene where Bilbo goes into Hobbiton to buythe fish which Dwalin the dwarf eventually eats at Bilbo’s table. At the beginning of disk two, there’s four short new scenes all set in the elves’ city of  Rivendell. In the first, Bilbo is enjoying a view of the waterfalls from a veranda and Lord Elrond comes along and has this little conversation with him. The two share a moment of humor and depart, but it’s nice because the theatrical version didn’t have these two interacting on a one-on-one basis at all. Then there’s a wordless scene where Bilbo wanders into the hall where the shards of Isuldur’s famous sword are kept and he sees a painting depicting Sauron wielding the one ring. Then Elrond and his assistant come upon the dwarves frolicking in a Rivendell fountain. There’s also a new scene where Bilbo and Thorin overhear Elrond talking to Gandalf about the history of mental illness in Thorin’s family.<br /><br />The rest of the new material consists of extended versions of scenes already in the theatrical version. In the early scene which sets up the backstory the dwarve’s city of Erebor and the surrounding human town of Dale, the extended edition shows a little more how the dwarves and Wood Elf King Thranduil came to be at odds, and slightly  more of the destruction of Dale by the dragon Smaug (although it really doesn’t show any more of that character). In the scene where Gandalf meets with Suramon, Elrond, and Galadrial, there’s an extra bit of conversation where they reference the rings of power and the one ring and Suramon expresses his belief that it was washed into the sea and will remain lost forever. Also in Rivendell, but towards the end of disk one, the scene where the dwarves are eating dinner hosted by the elves is extended with new footage where Bofur interrupts the elves’ harp and flute music to jump onto the table and sing a bawdy pub song and the scene ends with a food fight, much to the elves’ dismay. When the dwarves are captured and taken to Goblintown, this sequence is extended by an additional song by the Great Goblin and a little more conversation with the dwarves. There may be a few extra seconds added elsewhere, but these are the ones I noticed.<br /><br />A long debate could probably be had over how much the new material really enhances the film.  After all, it really doesn’t change anything or add significantly to the plot. But for me, Peter Jackson’s version of Middle Earth is a place I love to visit and any chance to linger a little longer is welcome, especially when the added footage melds relatively seamlessly with what was in the theatrical version. In my opinion, if you only want to own one version of this film, this would be the one to have.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Great  story and I especially liked the ending; it showed responsibility. I always enjoy Denzel Washington's prformances as well.  He s a good actor.
B008JFUS0U|4.0|- Loki (facing judgment from Odin the Allfather re his war crimes): \\"I really don't see what the fuss is about.\\"<br /><br />The heart of this film beats neither to the great romance between the Earth woman and the Odinson nor to a dark elf's vengeance that has seethed the span of the life of the universe. See THOR: THE DARK WORLD for the otherworldly grandeur and the larger-than-life characters and heroes fighting off an extinction-level threat and for the occasional drops of humor. But it'll impress on you soon enough that what anchors the narrative is the robust, complex, love-hate interplay between Thor and his step-brother Loki.<br /><br />You've probably learned your lesson from when you ducked out early the last time, but do stay for the two post-credit stingers.<br /><br />Maybe you should know that, every five thousand years, there is the Convergence, an event of mere minutes in which the Nine Realms are perfectly aligned. Maybe you react to that cosmic reveal in zen-like manner; you could be like that Buddhist who went up to the hot dog vendor and said, \\"Make me one with everything.\\" Or you could react like Malekith, him what bears an almighty grudge against the universe and so seeks its undoing. Good cess to you and me and the Buddhist with the hot dog, the dread dark elf was stymied millennia ago, his ancient weapon of choice, the Aether, destroyed. Or so it was thought the Aether was destroyed.<br /><br />Ain't it just like a dude? For two years Jane Foster has abided, waiting for her Asgardian to return like he said he would. Blame the trickster god, Loki, for Thor's big delay. Loki's misdeeds - specifically, those concerning the destruction of the Bifrost Bridge - have bred chaos in the Nine Realms. When not in New York smiting invading not-Skrulls, Thor's been preoccupied with restoring order across the Nine Realms. Still, Odin the Allfather has noted his son's confused heart. Odin tries to steer Thor's attention towards the beautiful and fierce Lady Sif. I'm down with that. I'm on Team Sif. We the movie-going audience could've used more of her and more of the Warriors Three. And maybe less of that pantsless astrophysicist (no, it's not Jane).<br /><br />By the way, it's nice to see \\"Chuck Bartowski\\" get himself another gig.<br /><br />Jane Porter, astrophysicist (with pants on), plays a critical role. She's in fact at the very core of the plot, which I guess is a fortuitous thing because, else, why have Thor come to Earth at all? I'll just say that, as the story opens, she's still in deep mopes about her missing thunder god when she hears word of a \\"stable gravitational anomaly\\" in London. Off she goes to investigate, catalyst to the plot and this time laden with more spunk.<br /><br />For those wishing that Thor would explore more of the Nine Realms and more of his relationship with his fellow Asgardians (including Loki), done and done (and done). Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston have done wonders to promote sibling rivalry. I feel like starting a feud with my brother myself, that dirtbag. Hiddleston is again remarkable. His performance full of layers. From having viewed the trailers, it's understood that there's a big bad out there bigger and badder than Loki. But don't dismiss this god of mischief, don't sell short his craving to rule and his towering rage and just how plain sneaky he is. He's the best kind of villain, compelling, intelligent, someone you can't help but like and maybe even root for. That charismatic deceiver.<br /><br />For the comic book reader there's a grip of gratification. I swear that giant rock monster that Thor faces in fleeting single combat is of the same alien species he tangled with in his debut in JOURNEY INTO MYSTERY #83 (1962). Malekith, of course, is an old foe, as is Kurse. Somewhere, Walt Simonson has got to have this wee smile. Maybe he's waiting for the Frog of Thunder arc to be adapted to cinema.<br /><br />Is it better than the first film? I dunno. Certainly the mythology is richer. I think THOR: THE DARK WORLD is worth paying to see (even the 3D doesn't suck), never mind that the narrative beats won't club you over the head with the originality stick and that the Asgardian dialogue comes off like Shakespeare in his cups. Never mind that Eccleston's Malekith inspires jaded shrugs more than invested hisses. And that we're once more subjected to that familiar ego stroke wherein humanity - or, in this case, Earth - turns out to be the focal point of the universe. Nngh. Well, what matters is that it's a visually arresting movie. The CG and the practical set pieces wonderfully evoke the glorious spectacle of Asgard and the ashen desolation of the dark elves' world of Svartalfheim. When I Mapquested the route from my house to Svartalfheim, the thing said the distance was two trillion miles. I don't have that kind of gas. Anyway, the movie does well in rounding out certain corners in the Thor universe. It's got this terrific fish-out-of-water element, only it's not Thor this time who's out of his element. It's a cast that represents. Hemsworth is comfy and commanding in the thunder god's burly skin. And while Natalie Portman improves on her performance from the first film - because she's given more to do here - I still think Thor is dumb as hammers for ignoring Sif. I just couldn't take my eyes off Jaimie Alexander. Rene Russo doesn't have a lot of camera time, but she shines when onscreen and demonstrates that Frigga, the gentle Asgardian Queen, can flip instantly into a complete badass warrior woman. In that one fighty fight she was in, I kept expecting to see Riggs and Murtaugh in the background cheering her on.<br /><br />And, if nothing else, I pull for these Thor movies because of my little niece's adorable interpretation of the name of Thor's mystical hammer, Mj&ouml;lnir. She calls it \\"Meow Meow.\\" Awww.<br /><br />Lastly, someone give Stan Lee his shoe back.logy is richer.

B00499NHLC|5.0|Excellent show. Brings all the stories I grew up reading into the modern day. I discovered this by liking Cumberbatch in Star Trek and looking for other things that he did. I think Cumberbatch might be even better in this series.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I found the series, as a whole, very engaging. Unlike most shows on the area, the plot twist literally are from &#34;left field&#34; so you never know what is going to happen next,
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have watched the Star Trek series since it started in 1966 and to see this line of events come full circle back to the original series with James T. Kirk ( William Shatner) in the seat for the Enterprise for its 5 year mission, was very fulfilling.  I am that old to have seen the first show and now to see the movie that brings me up to the start is absolutely amazing for me and other trekkies that have watched at the beginning.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Incredible program for reading, researching, and understanding Jehovah God's words of truth.  Modern language, footnotes, glossary, appendix, and five additional Bible Versions make this program the perfect addition to any mobile device.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great  Very interesting and informative. Navy seals are the best.  Glad I decided to read this book and account of the historic raid
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Good movie, not as great and the first in the series.  Thought the specials section in the movie that shows how they filmed a lot of the difficult scenes was well worth the price of the video
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My kids love playing this game. The have nothing but good words to say about candy crush saga. they love it
B003TSEEDY|3.0|NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS<br /><br />Call me sheltered, but sex, drugs, and (alternative) rock and roll was not quite what I expected when I chose this book, mostly because of the title (which I thought was rather clever) and the (teen) genre as I thought it might be an appropriate read for my high school freshman. Written in first person narrative style in letters-to-an-anonymous-reader format, 15-year-old Charlie’s story, which starts in August 1991 and continues for about a year, begins with news of a friend’s suicide. If that had not been enough bad news (as we had just learned the news of the suicide death of a 15-year-old acquaintance) to not recommend it to my 14-year-old, the plethora of mature-themed content would have been. The blurb on the back cover states, “It is the story of what it’s like to grow up in high school,” I’d have to add a few qualifiers. I’d say it’s the story of what it could be like to grow up in high school if your life is very depressing and sad. Step-sibling pot smokers Patrick and Sam befriend Charlie. He develops a crush on Sam (in the “unrequited love” segment of the story). Instead of kissing her, she tries to help him get a girl (he handles this badly), and he allows Patrick, who is gay, to kiss him after his still-in-the-closet high school football star secret love interest rejects him. Although the pair do seem to truly want to be his friend, they do other things that seem stupid, like feeding him pot-laced brownies. Although I love a bleak book as much as any other gal, I could not get past the constant barrage of sad stuff, including: suicide, extreme discipline (a father slaps his child in the face), bullying, teen sex, rape, alcohol and drug use, domestic abuse, abortion and the denouement about the aunt. Maybe if I’d had a more rotten high school experience, I could have enjoyed it? Best of the book: Charlie’s mix tapes and books read list. Better: The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, and His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman.r, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, and His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|jerry! this a great line up- the 1980 jgb, with ozzie ahlers, is wonderful. ahlers brings such a unique sound to jerry band. hot show.
B004AUFVU0|5.0|It's a great film, great acting and though it was made in 1960 it still seems fresh.  Some things, of course, are a reflection of the mores of the time, but it's fun to look back and remember how things used to be and how much we have changed.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|awful story awful ending. plot made no sense at all. Brad pitt was good as expected but waste of time
B00C74SHRK|5.0|Donna Tartt is like some new delightful contemporary Dickens to me. Her writing is clear and golden and so very gorgeous that towards the end of the novel I felt like the happiest reader in the world, having finally found what I was looking for for so long.
B0089XH38M|2.0|It works ok, I hope I never need to use it to locate my phone though. Just not sure if that option would be there. I don't really understand what the advantage it is to stop apps from running if they start running every time I wake my phone.
B0073B587E|5.0|The guitar is everything advertised and performs flawlessly.  It is fun to play (I am not a musician or guitar player) and entertain family and friends.  Whoever dreamed up this fun toy and designed it is brilliant and probably a lot of fun too.  Wish I could meet him.  Already I have recommended it to friends.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|jerry! wonderful show.  the two songs with bela are great. gdf! definitely worth having in your collection. Great jerry- lots of fun
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Ms. Collins holds and keeps your interest in the happenings and characters to the very end of her trilogy. I never knew what was going to occur next holding me hostage to the last page. I highly recommend her books.
B0047E9TRA|3.0|Older movie that I wanted a copy of. Worth seeing again. Remains me how mean people can bi to people that are not the same as them.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I was very skeptical of this show at first. Thought it was just a bunch of rednecks. But the story line keeps twisting and changing unexpectedly. It's fantastic.
B005ISQ7JM|2.0|Not much here that I think has value if HTML5 is of interest.  There are other books that offer working knowledge that are far more useful.<br /><br />It was free so I gave it 2 stars.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|The main character for this book is about five times too good at everything except keeping his mouth shut.<br /><br />The scene descriptions and world building are nice, but there's no sense that the author is in control of how over the top his protagonist has become.<br /><br />Three bridges too far:<br />1. The main character is not only the most skilled at all the various things in his youth, he's also the most tortured, regretful, depressed person around in his old age (of thirty-something!).<br /><br />2. The culture that doesn't understand where babies come from.  But is perfect in every other way (other than xenophobia, I guess).<br /><br />3. Manic pixie dream girl turned up to 11.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|finally an official release of one of the great grateful dead shows! one of my personal favorite dark stars! legendary show! stoked
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Makes it easy to get to my page on my Android tablet without having to go back to my desktop.
006202406X|5.0|Great read! All of her books have been great! I am now passing it around to all my students in my English IV class.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Josh Gorban is an amazing talent. I saw him in concert recently at the St Petersburg Times forum. Not only can he sing, he plays multiple instruments. His voice is exquisite.<br /><br />This album captures his essence .The songs have you swaying in tempo. Needless to say the man is a great talent and this album is a must own for all his fans..
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I already had a prior version in my virtual Kindle library.  I got this one for updated material.  It is free and it does contain useful information.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, the eBook edition falls into one of the traps suggested to be avoided.  This trap is to make sure you check and verify your book before submitting.  I think the other unsettling thing about this latest version is I was never certain that I had gotten to the end of this eBook.<br /><br />Seems that there is an extra page at the very end, that can be seen at about 95-99% that duplicates the last few lines of the last page  --  At least in my copy!<br /><br />If you are planning to publish a Kindle book this is the document to get.  There is no reason not to get it even if a book is not in your near future -- IT's FREE!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game can challenge you from easy to difficult, makes you think.  Enjoy it very much, makes time go very fast.
B000UZPIAW|4.0|I enjoyed the book immensely, but... after reading the hygiene issues associated with his addiction, it kind of made me wonder how in the world he ever managed to have any women at all though; yuck.  LOL<br /><br />There are other surprising things in there as well.  The Rock-n-Roll lifestyle we all expect, but some of this stuff, no, not at all. :)<br /><br />It took a lot of guts to publish something like that, and I think this book can be very beneficial to others.  Good job Nikki Sixx.<br /><br />You can also tell how intelligent the man is even through &#34;those times&#34; when these diaries were written; and the book is put together very well with much humor.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I'm having trouble getting it to work on my Android device. It was initially working OK, but then it started having this launch problem -- the spinning wheel -- that never ends! Working on a fix for it. Hope it works.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|wow...all I can say is wow, but I have to write 10 more words so I say you must read!!!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was disappointed at this book. I felt the author rushed to finish the series. The other two books were amazing so after reading this book, it was disappointing. I felt like the big build up reveal wasn't as sweeping under the rug fabulous that the author builded it up to be. Sorry, wasn't a fan.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|The best story ever told.  Remember how much you mean to everyone who comes into your life.  I have watched this movie every year since I was young and never tire of the beautiful story.  It gives me hope.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well if you have read the first and second books well you will love this because it wraps it all up in a twisted violent ending that settles down and lets you and our characters live on
B007SGM084|2.0|The book was poorly written, and some of the storylines the author added in were so outlandish it was almost comical.<br /><br />I do not recommend it.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I don't need to use a word processing app often, but this one seems to be OK for a freebee!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|tom was on his a game here with a great supporting cast and a top notch story with twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not as good as the first two. Didn't like the voice of the Tobias chapters. It took awhile for me to get into this book. Felt like the writing was different.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Nice program for people who like to think.  Some of the pictures are real easy but others leave you scratching your head.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Fun at first, but I'm at a level where friends have to help you unlock more levels, or you have to pay to unlock it? Been stuck here for a couple weeks, not impressed!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was like the &#34;real&#34; Stephen King returned.  I had always loved his books but then for a while they just got weird.  So &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is a lot more like &#34;The Shining&#34;, &#34;Salem's Lot&#34;...that generation of King books.  I truly enjoyed the story and it scared me in a way only a King book can scare.  There are parts toward the end that I had to focus on because I thought maybe I had missed something.  I think this one takes a bit of imagination on the reader's part because of the mind games everyone plays.  But not to give the story away, if you are a King fan, it is a must read.  I would love to see it as a movie as long as they don't ruin it as Hollywood seems to do with the best of them.<br /><br />It is a lengthy book but I couldn't put it down.  Totally worth the time!  I was kind of sorry when I was finished.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|This is just the right size for little hands. It was purchased for my 3 year old granddaughter and she just loves it.
B008PZZFHA|5.0|this movie is a all time classic with great songs that will stay with me forever and a lot of social commentary that's still relevant today .  I love the show and will forever may it never end
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Great addictive fun game!! MY SISTER HAS ME HOOKED AND NOW WE BOTH CAN'T STOP PLAYING!!!  Lol However it does freeze a lot
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|it was just an okay movie, could of been great though. a good start for jaden smith. will smith was very good.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this novel. Great great GREAT!  I'm reading it again because it was so good.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Definitely worth seeing, Denzel is amazing in this movie.  You never know if to cheer or boo his character. Must see
B00007KWHG|5.0|Just what the title says... The very best !  Love this cd. It starts from his earlier songs to his most recent. Great clarity.
B00G32TD98|5.0|this movie was one of the scariest movies I've seen . the warren's are the real deal knowing this came from them makes it that much more unnerving
B004H4XLR4|3.0|Fun toy BUT the tail fin breaks too easily and is hard to repair. I glued it back a couple of times but it is not really repairable.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|very good, lots of action and realistic. Good performance by brad pitt and his co-stars. i liked it a lot.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a great book. I haven't actually read the shining yet so if you haven't, don't let that stop you from reading this one.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Best hunting game ever for kindle and android phones. Great graphics and cool guns definitely worth the download im impressed
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I loved this series and waited excitedly for this book to come out.  I stared reading it but it didn't have me on the edge of my seat like the other two books. I feel like it was just like when movies start to run out of time and hurry to wrap up the ending.  It's is written like the other two books but kept switching points of view. I understand that there were different parts if the story that needed to be told but it took me out if the story a lot. I'm also not a fan of the ending but that's just my opinion. Read the book if you want to find out how the story ends.
B0091VYG86|4.0|the hd  playback was great and it's just a great movie with a outstanding cast. also a lot of tricky special effect's taking in to account that this was before digital cameras
006202406X|4.0|Certainly this was a very dark book.  I found it very compelling and very real, and many readers will probably dislike it for this reason.  This book is very much about humanity - the whole series has been, but this one more so.  It has less plot than the other two books, and is very much about who we are as humans.  There is also a lot of science fiction in this one, more so than the first two books.  This can be tough to enjoy for a non-sci fi audience.  I would have liked to have seen a little more happiness, but I can still appreciate the realness of the book.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Not Jacksons best film, but still a great work in and of itself.  It is &#34;Kiddish&#34; in that there isn't enough gore, vulgarity, or realism, and there is perhaps too much comic relief for me to call it &#34;Jacksonian&#34; however the movie does do a great job in portraying a great story.  The special effects are notable, and it gives a different appreciation to Tolkiens world than the book. Overall I say definitely see it, its not disappointing, yet don't go expecting the epic drama that LOTR was.  Its a childrens tale.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a very awesome play a bit slow but still very great it has all my favorite ponys plus more.
B008GWP2GG|3.0|The movie wasnt too bad. Watched it in the movies when it first came out. Did not like the ending
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Had to wait a while before I wrote my review because the ending made me angry but overall it was a good conclusion and not your cookie cutter trilogy ending and doesn't mislead you into hoping for more
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Finally came to amazon yay. Love it wish u got more lives but what are friends for.....  need more lives. Need more friends lol.
B00664AM5C|5.0|As a nurse, I find parts of this film very realistic and I screen it in class for my students to remind them why infection control is so important in medicine. As entertainment, this movie is pretty gripping, with story lines and characters you can really care about.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|Such a powerful movie!! So heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. I was fighting back tears, I was consumed by the story.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the game is so much fun and it is really addicting but it glitches a lot on my kindle fire.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|This app is amazing. I did not believe you could get this quality from a free app. It does everything it was said to do. It is like opening Microsoft on a computer. Same format and foundations. No complaints and beyond impressed.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Not Grisham's best. Fairly predictable. The reader gets a sense of the generally mundane pracice of law as it heats up for a special case. Good because he is always good.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love this game. I think it's awesome. Game play is excellent and addictive. I can't stop playing this bubble bursting game!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I was on vacation when this book was delivered to my Kindle and I dove right in with eager anticipation. I was able to finish in two days. Of the three books in the series, I would rank this as second best. The story moved along better than the second book, although was still a bit slow in a  few places. I did think the genetic link was a bit contrived but otherwise this book was worth the read - especially if you have already read the other two books.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I really feel that this book was rushed to be published. I felt that the story lines were not deleloped enough. With more time I think she could have written a better story.  It really didn't grip me like the first two books. I though this book was a disappointing ending to what started as a great trillogy.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Fun movie with lots of laughs.  Reminds me of my relationship with my son who is also a salesman.  Casting was great; the people fit their roles.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|A good, fun, adventure for the younger Miyazaki fans out there in the world. Even being an adult I do find myself smiling and laughing from some scenes...Guess I am still a kid in a way haha.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|It works and gives temperature and current weather but not much more.  There are much better weather apps.  Doesn't give forecast well or show where storms are and weather warnings or advisories.  Weather bunny is much better and it is very simple.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|The Polar Express movie and book are both fantastic!! It truly draws you in and keeps your attention! Makes you feel like a kid again!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|That said... it is a fun and challenging game - if annoying at times.  Easy to learn, hard to master.  The bright and colorful candies make for a pleasing view as you try and meet that level's goal and move on.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|I just downloaded the app of the day version. Installed it and could not put it down the first 30min of playing it.  No points or stars to rack up just get thru the level. I love it.  Takes skill and timing to get past each level great game works well on Motorola Xoom.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|The acting, interaction between actors and the difficulties of living with bipolar disorder is well portrayed in this film.  Hopefully it will help people understand the mood swings and other behaviors that accompany this disorder.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Cute graphics, plays great on kindle and is addicting ....a must have! I definitely recommend! Get it! Get it! It plays better on my kindle than on fb
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This was an excellent movie with a great plot. Truly original, definitely worth seeing. This is one of the better movies that I've seen in a while.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok this is the best game on my kindle fire hd and I got some good games.Right when I got this game I thought it would be like tempo run ,but no this is a lot better than tempo run,  and all running games .One there is awesome characters you start of a spraying a train when a cop comes over and tries to get you I am not going to tell you anymore ,because you need to play it yourself and you should get it .ps it is free$$$$$$ please subscribe
B005LAIGPU|3.0|This is a drama with some sci-fi elements. I was under the impression that this was a sci-fi movie with some drama, I was disappointed.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Disjointed plot linking scenes of excessive violence. Highly unlikely decisions by heroes creating desperate scenarios. Contrived elder discrimination.<br /><br />Highest caliber acting. Great chase scenes and good special effects for those who fancy them. Outstanding opening and closing.
B002VECM6S|5.0|One of my favorite movies!  The story is encouraging and shows how intervention in a young person's life can change him forever.  It's well done and appears to honestly relate the story of the people involved.  Well cast and acted.
B002S0OBN2|5.0|I love this musical, its a very good cd. Ramin and Sierra sound wonderful together. I enjoyed listening to it.
B00F8OUBXE|4.0|Return Cd from this metal band that broke up for a few years. All the songs pretty much have their signature sound that we all are familiar with. Metal at its best,weight of the world is probably my favorite Cd but this one is still good.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I love this book. This is the third time I've read it.  Frank McCourt captures the life of the poor Irish Catholics and tells the story through the eyes of an innocent child (himself growing up).  It is heartbreaking and refreshing and amusing all at the same time.
B0084TWN9K|1.0|Do I have to give it any stars?  I hated this book and found it depressing.  If I didn't have to finish it for my book club, I would have put it down after the first 75 + pages.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|One of the best syfi series ever made. Season 2 is where they hit their stride and it continues for another 8 seasons.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|it's a great book, but you have to hang on as you read it, because it gets complicated a bit, but all is good, as long as you stay with the Book...it has some great insights for couples, I do use this for my pre-marriage and marriage counseling when needed. I strongly recommend anyone to read this.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It contains a simple set of experiments that reflect our attitude and awareness about our own reality. We are the captains of our destiny. We are the architects of our life.<br />Great!
006202406X|5.0|I just finished Allegiant and I loved every twist and every turn. I'm not sure why everyone is rating this so low, Divergent and Insurgent were definitely laying the groundwork for an ending that was not going to be sunshine and roses. I would definitely recommend this series.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|The reason for giving this book 5stars is because you get lost in what your reading I think it is a great book for kids
1250006341|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and the person who got it loved it.  I have never seen the book, but that doesn't matter in this case.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As in The Kite Runner, Hosseini takes us to Afghanistan; Americans of Afghan heritage also figure into the tale which spans 3 generations.  It's a wonderful story about a society that I knew almost nothing about, and beautifully told.  No magical realism here, which I appreciate.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good read. It started off slow but eventually picked up and I was eager to pick back up where I left off every time. The story line was intriguing; switching between past and present. A book worth sharing.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Excellent fun. Challenging. Hope to see more levels soon. Would recommend this for any age group. Great geaphics. For a simple game too
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Good relation price-functionality. Easy to use and automatically sync with Google, if you take some time to work the settings. You can create alerts &amp; deadlines, however I miss the assign to option.<br />It would be a top app should it synced with outlook. Not there yet.
140006922X|5.0|The book got me to thinking about some of the issues he investigated. It is well written and goes into great detail an all aspects of Jesus' life.
B005721W9O|2.0|Just not a very good movie. Glad I rented it instead of buying it. I loved Tim Allen in Home Improvement, but not in this movie.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was and is a great story. I loved the way he brought the plot around to a full circle.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|interesting people and places. exciting pace. somewhat difficult to beleive. great escape reading. agent pendergast is always a very capable underdog.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Okay so I started Ender's Game because my friends encouraged me to start it. I was barely half-way through the first page and I was hooked. The story is never dry, and you find yourself wrapped up in little Ender's emotions. It's heartbreaking and uplifting all at the same time. I would recommend this to anybody.
B001BEK8E2|5.0|I saw this movie at age 6 and was totally mesmerized although I didn't understand it.<br /> I still find it to be the best move I have ever seen. It's actually about WWI through the eyes of the Japanese. What caused it? How were they bought down so low? How did Japan com to total ruin?<br />In every way possible, the movie is pure perfection: dialogue, photography, acting, the ancient setting and the absolute Buddhist simplicity. It has a sense of eternity that fits nowhere but everywhere.<br />  The story is clear at first; but as it  slowly sinks in it is no longer clear. Ultimately it is a horrible tragedy made bearable only by the baby they want to protect at the end in the bombed-out temple. It's not at all happy; but it is some reason to hope in the future.<br />The Japanese, by the way, are great film makers; too bad westerners are not aware of it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|An extremely raw reality of cancer...at times it hit a little too close to home and I had to put the book down and mentally prepare myself to read on, but I think that's the point of the book. It dives into some pretty heavy philosophical thinking about death, life, and even just trying to get by as a teenager. I thought it was beautifully written and easy to read but did not really like all the sarcastic back and forth between the main characters, at times I thought their tone was arrogant and even though it brought some comedic relief to the intense plot it seemed very obvious that an adult was writing the dialogue and it was not the voice a teenager. Overall though I think this book is a great read even though I am still haunted by the reality of it.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Dude is Capt America, c'mon Stan Lee the icon of comics has done it again. Looking forward to seeing the next installment.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|WAITING FOR CANDY CRUSH TO COME OUT ON THE KINDLE WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT.  I JUST WISH I WAS BETTER AT IT.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Another Amazon App Store App for Smartphones, but not Kindle Fire HD, which and its sister App Battery Doctor do not have the ability to display in landscape mode, ... just portrait mode.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|Bought this about a year ago and still having excellent luck for vocal and guitar recording. Haven't taken it out to the garage yet to try to mike up the drums, so I can't comment on other musical instruments yet. The biggest problem I've had is that the &#34;power on&#34; LED is so bright that it hurts my eyes. This was easily remedied with a piece of black e-tape.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Extremely well written and from the point of view of an extraordinary narrator. It gives you a glimpse into a world often seen through the eyes of an adult, but this time the main character is a little girl growing up in a world consumed with hate... and yet still hopes for compassion and love. This is a book that deeply changes you. Amazing.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Chris Hemsworth really brought this movie to life I like all kinds of movie and one of the big one's is Sy-Fyi
B00BSBR9N6|2.0|Not engaging.  I didnt feel any connection to the characters....not a book for those looking for a good story.  No connection made.
B0097PW7H8|3.0|Another Amazon App Store App for Smartphones, but not Kindle Fire HD, which and its sister App Clean Master do not have the ability to display in landscape mode, ... just portrait mode.
B00B19DW0E|3.0|Good old classic 80s style movie, escape from L.A. 2 better but this is a musty watch if your a fan of snake.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!!! Candy Crush has shown us kindle fire users some love! Lol I love candy crush and be advised it is addictive smh but who cares right? Lol enjoy!
B005LAIGP0|5.0|Daniel Radcliffe really brings this movie to life. It is strang and scary all in one movie and I like that.
0316228583|5.0|Yes, it does have 30 characters and it is 500 pages long, but the complexity of the human situations are what make it so good.  Although it takes place in England, it could be a small town in any western country with a view of class conflict, child abuse, adoption, marraige, love relationships, and small town petty politics.  Well worth every page!
B00B5HQL50|4.0|It was OK.  I'm still not a huge fan of Daniel Craig as Bond, but the movie was still entertaining.
B00ELOOYZI|4.0|This app works well and is very addictive. it is a great way to kill hours of time whether you want to or not.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|It was good, but it dragged. There were times I think I went to do something and chose to not pause watching it. Just let it play. Love watching Ryan Reynolds. Disappointed with bridges.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|I love how you just get all cought up in the missing patient that and it is scary and I like that some times. Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job in this movie.
0061914177|5.0|Great book. Highley recommended to anyone entrepreneurial. Gives you insights on social media marketing techniques that really work from a proven success
B00FEHXISA|4.0|Exciting and a very interesting plot twist. Nicely acted, especially by Gwyneth Paltrow, although Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was a bit over the top. All supporting cast did well. Too much happening in the heavy action scenes, especially towards the end of the movie to be able to follow what happens to who at all times. Worth watching for a bit of movie magic though.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Everyone should read this book… often.  It is life changing and yet so simple.  I have given many as gifts and I keep mine handy all the time.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It was constantly moving. It got a little slow at the end and expected a different ending or better ending.
B00F1RR3Y8|1.0|It does not work!!!! Loaded with ads!!!! Do not waste your time! I wish I had not downloaded this app
B0018TLRTK|4.0|Really enjoyed this cd. It brought back memories  when I lisitened to this it. Was good memories...Some songs have such great insite, at least to me..
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|my kids love it. watched it so many times i can't count since i bought it. i have even watched it a few times and find it very funny and entertaining.
