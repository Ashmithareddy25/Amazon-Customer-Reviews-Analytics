1781162646|4.0|Hard Case Crime with a Stephen King twist.  I'll be looking for more of these from him.  Great read with a touch of romance.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just got to say this piece solved most of my streaming problems! Got to get some more for my other sets!
1476727651|5.0|All I can say is, King reigns supreme!!! Dr. Sleep met all of my expectations.  I read The Shining years ago and I'm glad I did, but I don't think it's a must before reading Dr. Sleep.  It stands on it's own.  Mr. King knows how to keep his readers reading.  Thinking I could read for an hour before bed....next thing I know it's 2 AM!!  Loved it, loved it, loved it.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  If you are looking to better develop a reasoned critique of the financial system as it relates to the sale of mortgages and mortgage backed securities in the years leading up to the 2008 US financial crisis, this is a great resource.  The author presents a detailed look at several individuals whose diligent research allowed them to foresee the growing bubble in the mortgage market.  If you are looking to better develop a defense of the banking industry this is a good book as well because it allows the reader to identify the key arguments proffered against unregulated securities trading.<br /><br />It took me a while to read this book because I found myself stopping to perform Google-searches to learn more about the key players in the book - I guess one critique of the book is that the author could have provided better biographies.<br /><br />I read this book free of charge through the Amazon Prime Lending Library - it is unclear to me if the publisher, author, or Amazon makes the decision to include a book in the lending library, but I am grateful to whoever made the decision and thankful to Amazon for developing a system that provides the opportunity to easily and cheaply read these books.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I really liked this movie. It's not scary as some of the others out there, but it has some nice plot twists to it. It moves along too and is not stalled like some of the B rated movies of Zombies.Brad Pitt does a decent job of being this father that has to take care of his family and worry about how to solve the crisis that is before him.
B00G32OER4|4.0|A horror film without the cheese! (well not as much as most) This film is very loosely based off a true story and it is greatly exaggerated but for a horror film it is very professionaly made and worth the watch for horror fans!
B005LAII4E|3.0|It was an okay movie, but i found the first one more interesting. I couldn't get into this movie.Even with the rock playing in it. But if your a fan of the joe sage then you should like this one too.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|This isnt typically my kind of film but it was fun! I was turned off when I first watched the trailer for this and saw it was basically a 'Godzilla' type film. Despite that this film is done in a way which works even with that concept.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  I Was so disappointed when it wasn't avlb. For kindle, but when it was it was like christmas
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I wish I had paid attention to the name of the person that helped me.He was very helpful and I had my order within days.The cord works very well.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|after Stallones Judge Dredd.left me with fear when i found out that they made a new dredd film ,two things Dredd has never done is one joked around and second took his helment off .. great movie
B00640UICA|5.0|I recommend this game it is very entertaining. There are a few challenges in the game but definitely worth<br />getting.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|nice and easy read, enjoyable.  Keep writing!!<br />its hard to find a book these days without trashy language. Good story!!
B003IDMUVI|4.0|I love Grisham's stories and this one does not fail to hold your interest. I was completely absorbed whilst on holiday.<br />It is always satisfying to read stories about big insurance companies being tackled for their devious contracts. I thoroughly recommend this book.
6305841861|5.0|I know I'm going to be in the minority here, and will probably be excoriated for it by the other fans, but I think this is even superior to &#34;Army of Darkness.&#34;  I think it perfectly straddles the line between the grueling horror of the original &#34;Evil Dead&#34; and the flat-out slapstick of the sequel, crafting probably the best experience of the bunch.  I really, really enjoyed this and it's very high on the list of my favorite horror movies.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|24 hour rentals are just not enough. I fell asleep last night watching and couldn't find time till tonight (honey do day) to finish watching bit guess what...the time ran out. At least with a $1.25 R@dbox rental I can keep the video 3 days for the same price. No wonder people pirate movies. Streaming with time limits is for the birds. At least let us finish before timing out. It can be that hard to negotiate with the studios. You have the upper hand!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I pick this ratings because I found the book to be very good and even thou it went back and forth from the past to the present it was not hard to follow the story.
1401929281|5.0|Love the practicality and application of what I had perceived as a complex scientific subject.  I originally thought DNA was way out of my understanding level.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. The jewelry is beautiful. Can't wait for next season. It's time for Edith to shine.  Let's find her a foreign prince!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My son loves this game and I like the levels.<br />Keeps it interesting, hope they will keep making this type of game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and frustrating but I cannot stop playing it!! It releases stress while creating its own!! Love it!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|This game has great graphics. It was challenging enough to keep me going for days. I can't wait to play another from the designers.
1781162646|4.0|Let's get this out of the way right now. I love reading Stephen King books. I have read some of his best...It, The Stand, Needful Things, Salem's Lot and some of his not so great...Bag of Bones, Lisey's Story, Dreamcatcher, as well as several short story books. While I enjoy reading his books, part of my problem is that I do not have the time to sink into a 800-1000 page book at this point in my life. So when I saw Joyland and its relatively short length, I knew I could get through it in no time and with a business trip upcoming it was perfect for the plane ride that was forthcoming.<br /><br />So what did I find? I found a great summer read with a solid mystery at its core. In addition it was a great tale of love lost and adulthood found.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|one of my top 5 movies of all time. great story and great acting by alec guiness. William holden & Suzuki hiakawa.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Your traditional zombie story focuses on a ragtag bunch of survivors who come together in a single American urban wasteland, then spend most of the plot trying to reach a particular sanctuary goal - usually Alaska or an island. What about the rest of the world? In most zombie fiction, the rest of the world is addressed in a few throwaway lines like &#34;I hope the Russkies are getting it just as bad&#34; or &#34;That's when Brazil dropped a nuke.&#34;<br /><br />If you've ever really wondered how the broader world and all of its working components would handle a zombie invasion - because obviously, some countries and people would be better suited than others - then World War Z is for you. Max Brooks uses a series of oral interviews with survivors from around the world to weave a tapestry that's broader, richer, and more satisfying than anything else in the genre I've read or seen. He's been compared to Studs Terkel, and I see a lot of &#34;Working&#34; in this book. And Brooks deserves credit for creating fully believable, realistic, well thought-out vignettes and an overall story arc from the most unbelievable, unrealistic premise imaginable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so addicting and fun you will never won't stop playing this game take my advice an  millions of others get minion rush you won't regret it .
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I lost my previous copy of this movie so I came on here and chose to buy this one! Love it, happy with my purchase.
B005HF0BIE|5.0|Excellent, acting I am loving this series. The whole show is well planned out and really lets you understand what was going on during that time period.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Fantastic original story line. Easy read but with enough going on to keep up interest. Great book for that next holiday.
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|i love to paint and draw to her music playing in the background. I also have her on when Im cleaning my house. My kids love her too.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|Dream Theater has scored with another thickly layered, feast of musical gymnastics!<br />Although they have not broken any diversely new ground, evverything on this disk is a joy to hear, and their wide range of talent shines through!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game as I'm sure anyone who has it would know. Those who don't need to get it, oh and you should know it is a addiction
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Good Story of Comradeship with a love story twist thrown in for good measure. CGI battle scenes were alright - not great.<br />Enjoyable for a weekend escapade. Just dont expect too much from the film. Plot is a bit thin but story is well told.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I just love this series. I am now done with this series and I will just say.......I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|Free means free, not free till you get to a certain level then buy points, It has been deleted now!
0762451319|4.0|I got this for my girlfriend, who si really into these books.  The necklace is cool but the other stuff is kind of a waste of time.  It just sits on her desk.  But, the necklace rocks. And she looks good in it!
B0094K1K8I|3.0|Although it was made like an amateur video, and I nearly turned away several times; it kept pulling me back in. By the end I enjoyed it and it left quite an impression on me. All in all it was worth watching.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Oh WOW was this book an unexpected shot of hilarious genius!  When an egotistical, self absorbed player goes through women and discards them at the speed of light and finally falls in love, his pursuit is complicated by his sense of entitlement and major competitive nature, all told in the male point of view. Brilliant and wonderfully written, there are so many &#34;laugh out loud&#34; moments in this book I could not put it down. Will I ever forget his teaching his 4 yr old Neice that &#34;Prince Charming is a douchebag who's only holding Cinderella back.&#34; Or if she goes into real estate when she grows up and can buy the castle herself.<br />  If you loved &#34;Wallbanger&#34; and &#34;Crazy Little Thing&#34; then you will go completely bug nuts for this.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have an Apple TV but was hoping the Chromecase would allow me to mirror my Chrome browser to the TV.  Although this is advertised as a Beta feature, it is completely unusable.  The audio on the TV is fine but the video is out of sync and freezes frequently.  I have tried this with multiple computers on multiple wi-fi networks and it still causes problems.<br /><br />Although it will not be used at home, I plan on keeping this device.  It will be useful for Netflix while traveling and is more portable than the Apple TV.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book had 14,000 \\"fairly good\\" reviews so I bought it...now I wish I could get my money back.<br />Only buy it if you want to waste your money and if you have nothing better to do with your time. Also there is absolutely no ending...what's up with that!<br />I guess I better stop counting on people knowing good literature because this clearly isn't!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Harvey and Mike are great characters.  I love the quick dialog and bromance.  Currently watching season 3. :)<br />Highly recommend.
1250038820|5.0|I have been a Mid-West girl all my life so it is very interesting to see other lifestyles pictured in this book.  The photos are fabulous and the stories are intriguing - a mix of fun, fascinating, poignant, heartwarming.  I love this book!
B004KPQK2S|5.0|I love watching this movies!  It is a wholesome family movie that is inspiring, courageous  and full of the type of faith we often forget!!
0545101417|5.0|This book was by far the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed the story much better than the first. Exceeded my expectations!
B00014X8KO|5.0|This is a set of three different short anime films. The brilliance behind the highly lauded Akira (Katsuhiro Otomo) manages a deep, humorous, scary, exciting, and cerebral experience in this set of very special films. I highly recommend this to any anime enthusiast out there.<br />Note: Films run consecutively so as to create a seamless experience.<br />Great stuff!
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|.. because just a look at a magnificent animal like a killer whale with his beautiful dorsal fin collapsed, prisoner and forced to live his whole like going back and forth in a swimming pool instead of roaming the immensity of the ocean should immediately convince you how immoral, inhumane, mindlessly cruel is to torture these animals for your amusement and for the speculation and interest of the park owners.<br />If you are unable to understand this basic point, you are a m0r0n,  and I am sorry for you.<br />But there's still hope.. maybe even if you're such a m0r0n watching this movie can help in &#34;correcting your behavior&#34; ...<br />Or feel free to keep embracing &#34;the american way&#34;, &#34;money justifies everything&#34;....
B00003CX5P|5.0|As the title and rating in this review might suggest, I am a huge fan of Star Wars. I wouldn't say anything negative about it even if in all my years of rerunning this movie I had ever actually found anything of some merit to criticize. Star Wars is super SIDEWAYS!
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Good movie. Regarding love and law school romance and bromance and crushes and a little unrealistic but enough to get 4 stars
B008AK8FHM|5.0|As much as we hear these days that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of one person, Dr Alexander's experience shows that on the day that you die it is only you and your choices as an individual that really count!!
0061733199|5.0|Just spend10 minutes with this book and you will learn several things that could save your life one day. A must have.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent period piece.  The series continues to impress me with its flow of time.  Words change, manners change, subtle differences that would take place over a period of time are picked up by the actors and placed in their performance.  Never forced and always natural to the character they play.
B00CAGCVZE|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my dad. He used it for about a month and then it stopped working. He treated it with care and only used it when he went jogging. We had to RMA this product. Luckily, Transcend offers lifetime warranties on their products. I just wish I hadn't had to use it. I had to send this for repair/replacement as well as another product of theirs.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Was a pretty awesome movie visually, the story line was a bit lame but I was pleased and ok with paying the money to rent it.
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|At the moment I haven't sat all the way through this bluray release. I love the movie and I have seen several different releases of it and the others within the Trilogy. I am aware that there are a few different cuts floating around and from what I have read this is one of the better ones. Once I have the time to sit down and review this bluray release I will update this review. As of right now my three stars is really just to show that I like the movie. Depending on this cut and master of it... it could go down or up.  Edit: I should have come back a long time ago to raise this up. This was a great cut and it was well mastered. The movie is badass as always. I was reminded of this because of the new series on Starz &#34;Ash vs Evil Dead&#34;.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is amazing!!! It is like using a real gun and the graphics are good. This app is worth your money.
B003K16P3M|5.0|One of the best written YA books in this genre, comparing to City of Bones, Twilight and similar YA science- fantasy.  Character development is solid and story line endearing.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|I first heard  parts of this Yo-Yo Ma cd on Pandora. I listened for it almost daily. Then, it struck me: why not just buy the cd? I did and am hearing even more of his versions of Ennio Morricone's music. Fantastic!  Lovely.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT WATCH..KEPT ME INTERESTED FROM BEGINNING TO END..<br />I THINK YOU WOULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE IF U LIKE EXCITEMENT
B008JFUNNM|5.0|I want you to close your eyes (not really, because then you couldn't read this) and imagine something for a moment.  A weathered Bruce Willis sips his coffee while chatting up a group of young, muscle bound actors as they stare out at the open sea.  Just as calm is setting in over the group, Willis sounds the alarms because there are pirates approaching.  Next, we see Will Smith stagger into view as he wields a gun and tries his hardest to win an Oscar by talking with an uneven accent.  He demands money, and lots of it, and next thing you know there is an all-out war as these seaman tear off their shirts, exposing their pulsating chest muscles, and race throughout the ship, taking out pirates left and right.  Willis, who appeared old and weathered on the outset, turns out to be in better shape than he's ever been in his life and the finale centers on a meticulously choreographed fight sequence between him and Will Smith where he spews some one-liners and winds up single handedly rewriting history.<br /><br />I shudder at the thought of what this movie would have turn into, had someone like Michael Bay directed it.<br /><br />Thankfully, we don't really have to think much about that, since Michael Bay did NOT direct this.  Paul Greengrass did, and while Greengrass has had his fair-share of directing action films (those Bourne sequels), he's done so with grit and class, and he's also managed to formulate some really interesting `adult' films (`United 93' still makes a serious impact on me).  He's smart, and he understands that creating tension does not have to revolve around the obvious.<br /><br />`Captain Phillips' snuck up on me.  I was walking into this with some intrigue but little expectation.  The reviews were strong, but I hadn't really read any of them.  I only knew of their status through word of mouth.  My biggest hesitation drew from the fact that Tom Hanks is an actor I just don't get.  He's attained this reputation in the industry as one of the greatest actors to ever live, and yet I've been largely underwhelmed by his career.  I consider his two Oscar wins to be two of the worst in the history of the Oscars, and I just, as a whole, don't find him very compelling.  That isn't to say that I've never liked him, for I have on occasion (his ease and naturalness in `That Thing You Do' was a great moment for him), but overall I just don't care for him.  So, to hear that this is his career best didn't mean much to me; at the time.<br /><br />Now that I've seen the film I have to say that I'm speechless as to the power he brings to EVERY moment of this performance, and those final twenty minutes are some of the best acting I've ever seen put to film, by anyone.<br /><br />The film tells the true story of Richard Phillips, the captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, a US cargo ship sailing to bring supplies to Africa.  While passing through Somalia waters they are hijacked by Somali pirates.  The danger of pirates had become a real thing over the past few months, and it was something that Captain Phillips was aware of and cautious about, but it wasn't anything any of them were really prepared for (it had never happened to an American ship before).  Just when it seemed like they had avoided the worst, one persistent pirate by the name of Muse winds up getting aboard the ship, and from there things take a drastic turn.<br /><br />I have to admit that I was really unaware of a lot of this story.  I remember when it happened, but I don't remember the details and so some of the shifts in this film and the plot details took me by surprise, in a good way.  For over two hours, this film had me trying desperately to breathe.  By the end, I was literally shaking in my seat.  The intensity level of this film is hard for me to describe, but I told my wife when we left (who was sobbing by the end of the film) that I had never felt like that while watching a movie.  It isn't the same feeling of intensity when watching a scary film or an average adventure epic.  There was such brutal honesty to each frame that the heightened empathy felt for Captain Phillips was something I almost couldn't bare up under.  Watching his plight felt almost too real, too authentic.<br /><br />His emotional breakdown (\\"Can you see this?\\") is choking me up right now, just thinking about it.<br /><br />This has already been a great year for film, and `Captain Phillips' is up there at the top.  It fuses genres together with precision yet an ease that makes the whole thing feel genuine, never forced.  The action is there, but the intensity of the film transcends that aspect and really lives and breathes in the moments (and large segments) where the action is non-existent.  The dedicated performances by the entire cast, but more notably by Hanks and Abdi, really bring an earnest authenticity to this film.  I said to my wife when we left the theater that I had NEVER seen fear so honestly depicted on film than while watching Tom Hanks react to the pirate intruders.  Greengrass's decision to keep the American cast from meeting the African actors before filming began was a smart choice, for it added an authenticity you can't fake.<br /><br />Another thing I really appreciated about this film, and something that I think should be noted, is that the treatment of the pirates was very astute.  Muse, while terrifying, has an actual arc (however subtle it may be) and helps create a well-rounded portrayal of the truth.  While their actions are never condoned, you can sense a personal desperation, and when Phillips pleads with visible anger (\\"You're not just a fisherman!\\") you can sense a backstory that holds Muse to his profession and his course of action.  Like he said, he's gone too far now.<br /><br />This has become the biggest surprise of my `film year' so far, and I'm ecstatic at how excellent this film really is.  Technically perfect, with a pitch perfect cast and a resounding finale that will lift your spirits but never in a heavy handed way (such devastating honesty), this is a film you CANNOT MISS!e adventure epic.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Pretty much anything you can put in a Chrome browser you can show on you TV. You can upload Powerpoint slides and documents to Google Drive and present material wirelessly which is nice for business applications. I've tested it and it works well on PC, Mac, iPads, iPhones, and Android devices.<br /><br />A few improvements needed:<br />1. My laptops get rather hot when broadcasting (tried on both a macbook and toshiba running windows 7, same results), yet my phone and ipad do not seem to be affected at all when broadcasting from them.<br />2. Broadcasting from tablets and mobile devices is limited to Play Store, Netflix, and Youtube. Add some browser support for these as well. Add support for Amazon Prime Video, Pandora, and iHeart Radio at least.<br />3. Sometimes the sound gets unsynced slightly and I have to stop and restart the broadcast to get it synced again.<br /><br />Over all it's a good product. A few improvements could make it a great product. Definitely worth $35.
6305558167|4.0|I'm not entirely familiar with the story of King Arthur.  I know it in passing, and I know some of the more familiar details, but overall I was really in for a shock when watching `Excalibur'.  I was left confused on the outset and actually had to Google the film's plot breakdown in order to understand where this was going.  That said, once I got the gist of things, it was smooth sailing (sort of).<br /><br />For me, the story told here and the way that John Boorman tells it, visually, is fascinating.  The twisted tale of Arthur's kingship and the conspirators to the throne (most notably Morgana) is enchanting and brutal, but there are some things amiss here that really take the film down a peg for me, most notably the horrific performance by Nigel Terry.  There is no reason to believe that this awkward young man would ever make a good king, and while Terry shifts his performance somewhat as the film progresses, it becomes blatantly obvious that the best scenes in the film are the ones that he is not in.<br /><br />Still, the film is gorgeous to look at, while still maintaining this earthy grit.  Helen Mirren is the clear best-in-show here, commanding her over the top persona (something that Nicol Williamson struggled with, despite the praise his performance has garnered) and delivering a performance that sends shivers.<br /><br />If you are familiar with the material, I hear that this is the best version out there.  It is flawed (even those who really admire it say so) but it was worth watching.  I just hate that the central performance is so awkward and distracting.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Read this book its the truth and reconciliation. George RR Martin is a creep in a good way. Also theres dragons.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|The story has a lot of twists and turns which I like and the characters are well developed.  Very macabre.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I enjoy that the Chromecast is so small. Compared to Roku and AppleTV. Granted, they can do more stuff but all I really needed was something that can let me stream Netflix on my TV. It's easy to unplug and bring to a friend's house too. I also like that I can control it from my iPhone.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Disney did a good job of following the book story.  The special effects just keep getting better.  Heros to like and villains to hate.  A good script combo.
0345529057|4.0|No complaints about the story at all, its even better than the show (which is how it always works when it comes to the book). The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because the font is too small!!!! I don't have any vision problems when it comes to near sight and I can read the font fine, but after about 20 pages my eyes hurt and I have a headache. I actually bought a magnifying glass to read these books.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Special effects were totally awesome.  Story line kept you guessing all the way through.  It was well worth the purchase.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This is another plot building episode. I am excited to see the next few and get to the point. Hurry up and watch
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun and challenging. Simple and addictive. Hours of play, love the modes, and best of all it's free. Definitely worth a try.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Well done very engaging! Author always on track never  disappoints a fast paced read. I recommend it as an excellent<br />Book.
B00G32TD98|4.0|It's not a bad movie, it's interesting because it is suppose to be a true. story. It has some scary moments, and some gotcha scenes. It also is a typical horror story with typical scenes and story lines. it's all been done before time and time again. What kept my interest is knowing this was suppose to be true.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a lot of fun!  It doesn't take long to play and the layouts are different each time, so there's always a new challenge.  Warning, though: it can be addictive!

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the game because it has a nice thing to go to it and have a nice thing to play!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The symbolism of life never forgotten, the guilt to the second  generation, the loving  forgiveness  of true christian belief, and the persistence  of an honest legal system in spite of money motivated lawyers with a truly great ending.  a great read with a honest hard working judge who knows equally of a history of southern injustice .
0345531957|5.0|Great book.  Perfect new condition.  John Grisham as his normal BEST!  If you like John Grisham, you're gonna love this one!
B00EUUJID6|5.0|She is already an Il Volo fan.  Last time I was that excited about an album, it was Pink Floyd The Wall.
0385537131|5.0|John Grisham is never a disappointment.  You will want to sit right down and start reading this book and will have a hard time getting back.  May cry when over.  It's that good!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Theres just something so artistic about it, alot of people get bored with all the singing in it and turn it off before even getting halfway through, I've noticed; but if you keep watching it gets really good. Pretty gory though I wouldnt recommend having your children sit through this one with you though. The musical part of it can really attract their attention, but it is def. not a movie for the innocent minded.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I read all the entire ERB Martian series books as a teenager, I couldn't put them down and they swept me away and so I became a Science Fiction fan.  Then when I heard there was going to be a movie, FINALLY, I was pretty excited. And what a movie it is!!  If you like adventure movies that are entertaining and family friendly, along the lines of  &#34;The Mummy&#34; or the first &#34;Pirates of the Caribbean&#34; then this movie is the same sort.  You can watch it over and over.  I didn't see the reviews before going to see it at the theater, so I was very shocked & surprised that it was not well received.  That's the way it goes - everyone's tastes can be different, but give this movie a try.  I think you might be pleasantly surprised and definitely entertained.  If Disney is listening, I am hoping for more John Carter, watch and become a fan too!
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|but it was still a fantastic movie. Matter fact, I hope they finish up the whole oz series.  favorite character - def. the lil china doll. :)
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I see there are a lot of bad reviews for this book. But I absolutely loved the ending to this series.  No one ever said that there HAD to be happy endings full of rainbows and butterflies. She captured every emotion in this final book.  I loved this series and sad that its now over.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my 12 year old son.<br /><br />We both related to each of the roles played by the actors.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I was captivated by this novel. Somehow all the detail did not become tedious but an adventure I thoroughly enjoyed. I sobbed, I laughed out loud and I rejoiced throughout this work, literally. I loved it and would highly recommend it especially to anyone who loves botany. I will likely read it again as I do with my favorites.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY! !!!..  So excited candy crush is on kindle.  Love this game. Thank you! The graphics are awesome. I love my kindle so much more.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book kept me staying up way too late reading!  Very good.  A bit like 50 Shades, but with a good storyline.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|As Zombie movies go, this one is ok.  Maybe a B-.  A lot of action, a lot of noise, a lot of in-your-face zombies.  Typical of such movies; not much plot, sappy lines, and a stupid ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have played this on FB and really enjoyed it so I was so happy to see that I can get it on my Kindle Fire now.. I can play against my friends when we are traveling and its fun, it makes the time go faster. It's a fun game because it keeps my interest..
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|For everyone who loved I and II I am sure you were so excited about III.  Nothing I can say will make you not rent this movie, but be prepared to be disappointed.  Some spots are very funny, but really a B movie this time.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show is so well written. The story was not at all predictable, and caught me by surprise several times. The acting is great as well.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I purchased 3 of these and only realized too late that they are 9 pin plugs.  My monitors do not use 9 pin, so I just threw away my money.  My fault I guess.
1594136742|5.0|I love accounts of personal and physical struggle occuring at same time.  Ms. Strayed opens up and tells more than we need to know, but insuring a great read.
B004JMY312|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid and even though I'm grown now, I still watch it whenever I catch it on TV.<br /><br />Even my nieces and nephews watch it and laugh. It's one of those great, family-oriented Halloween classics that everyone should add to their watch list be they young or old.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My girlfriend showed me this and I was thrilled, thank you Amazon. I will be putting it to much practice over a long period of time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A vintage Stephen King novel. This one rates right along with &#34;The Stand&#34;, &#34;The Shining&#34;' &#34;Tommyknockers&#34; and others. I could not put it down.
B00E9ZFIMM|5.0|I actually just got it so from what I can see it should meet all my note needs, Thank you for having it available.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I rated these books 5 stars each because I couldn't put the books down. Fortunately I have a Kindle so I didn't have to wait for the next book to arrive. I would recommend these books to all women but I don't think it's for men. The movie will be known as a &#34;chick flick.&#34;
B00FPH51LQ|2.0|Just terrible. It feels as though the entire film was completed in one take. I normally like the Bridges and Reynolds. Surprised they went in for this.
B003IHWLL8|4.0|Coming away from &#34;Gravity&#34; I felt I wanted more Clooney in my life so I decided to watch &#34;The Men Who Stare at Goats&#34;. Although the film is labeled &#34;dark humour&#34; it's nowhere near as dark as &#34;Hesher&#34; and, considering I was in the mood for something lighter, it fit the bill. A little bit of desert adventure, mix in a helping of Star Wars terminology, and blend with some high-profile actors = a solid rental.
B00G8YZ48K|5.0|I am really loving this Season so far.  I feel like the actors and actresses are doing a great job I really feel like I am watching something that really happened and is happening so I know they are doing a great job with makeup and characters.  An emotional ride with Zombies!!!  Love it!  Keep it coming!
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|a twist on an old plot. acting average.somewhat light on giving the background that led to the factions left behind
6305949980|5.0|What I can I add that the entire interwebs or you yourself haven't already thought or said? It's a classic for a reason: It's good.
B00E0SX118|4.0|The Croods is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. My 6 year old son and my husband and I all enjoyed it. I gave it a 4 star rating just because I do have a couple other favorites in front of it, but overall a great movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Serious hide and seek game.  Many different hide and seek areas. Didn't have to keep going back and forth to the different areas from beginning to end.
0307887448|4.0|Fun book. Was picked for a book club and I was 100% not wanting to read it, but it was easy to get into, easy to read, and enjoyable
B00DI5DPE2|1.0|when Technology turn Art in Garbage, sounds...thin...weak... and flat....horrible!!!,  I lik'd have my money back !!!, Mobile Fidelity doesn't delivery what they promises......
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|I had to stop. This game was consuming all my time. would  not suggest it for working people. took up too much time and you never know how may more levels there are.
B006S01GH2|5.0|Great comedy.  Great characters.  Story kept you guessing as to what was going on.  And a taste of living in France for the average guy or girl.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is fun. It is worth the  $6. You can build any thing you want.<br />You should buy this game it's amazing.
B005PK56TA|1.0|I only got through the pilot.  I like scary, but I found some things (baby body parts in jars) to be just gross not scary.  Also, I do not have an appreciation for drawn out, overly graphic, or disturbing sexual scenes.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I suppose if you are 15-25 or a deprived older woman this will suit your desire for sexual adventure. My friends tended to love it, including some women in their 80s! I found it a yawner.
B00EPFEY44|3.0|I have every concert Andrea Bocelli has put on DVD.  However, I found that this one short changed people because songs were cut out from the original concert.  If you notice during the concert, all of a sudden his clothes are different and yet there was no break where he left the stage.  On PBS he sang a duet with his fiancé in this concert.  His voice is his wonderful usual sound, but only 43 minutes for a concert seemed like I was short changed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game my kids and I both love it. Highly recommended and totally addictive. And definitely worth it since it's free.
006202406X|3.0|I found this book incredibly disappointing. Most of the book plot just doesn't ring true, and the writing is dull and uninspired. Surprisingly I didn't hate the ending. It's the only part where I felt her writing was at the same level as the rest of the series, where real emotion was shown - and while it wasn't the ending I wanted, I think the ending felt real.  Now, how they got to the ending... the book just LACKED. I can't identify what exactly was lacking, but I felt through most of it that this was NOT the story Roth had in mind when she was writing book one. I wish there was still a chance for that story to be told...
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is top notch compared to the rest of the search and find games that I've played. Graphics are cool, color schemes are amazing and the plot is fascinating. I'm enjoying it so far, and highly recommending it for those who love a good hidden objects game. This one makes you think.
B0050VJ29Y|5.0|This is a great collaborative album, especially if you love the music of Ennio Morricone! This album has the feel of a spaghetti western's soundtrack, with a lot of creativity and talent packed in. I highly recommend this!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Began painfully slow and then began to pick up momentum only to fall with a truly awful ending. Stop reading 3/4 of the way through!
B00EP22QKG|5.0|I got the album and wasn't expecting much,didn't have my hopes up. Joan Jett deliveres in spades.I Rode in my car the whole week listening to every song. The first 4 are tops, after that the others will have to be listened to later in life when I rediscover the album again in my car. :)P Some of the music hints at the influence of Blondie.But thats ok,cause it is only a small hint and not taken advantage of.I was hoping for her to be more punkish,but all in all great album.
1416955070|5.0|Came in perfect condition and arrived quickly.  My daughter loves the book! I intend to buy the entire series as she finishes reading them.
B004LPLU4K|4.0|We often read a book together as a family and then have movie night to watch the film.  There were 2 or 3 versions to choose from available on-line, but the 1993 version we chose lived up to expectations.  We thoroughly enjoyed the film!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun.  Doesn't work quite right on my Toshiba thrive but still fun.  Beware of lots of in ap purchases.  And you have to wait to play more if you lose too many times.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I wonder what is going to happen to Percy in the next book. I hope that he is part of that other great prophecy.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is fun but the in-app purchasing spoils it. If I refuse to buy,  the game shuts down for 20 minutes to entice me to pay money so I can keep playing.  I refuse to get taken in by that so I may delete the game.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|A lot of the financial jargon in this book was over my head or not that interesting to me. However I expected it and was able to enjoy the saga of Jordan Belfort. Some aspects of his drug use seem almost too far fetched to be true. I do look forward to the movie.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The characters are compelling and well acted and I've enjoyed the episodes.  My only disappointment is that the overall logic of the episode does not survive close scrutiny.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this follow-up to The<br />shining even better than the The Shining. I'm hoping for a sequel.I love the Character of Abra and I think she would be an interesting adult to explore.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|It is what it is, if you want to go funny fall asleep to the tick tockery.  They all know.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Perhaps because I have seen my grandson through cancer, this book was especially heart wrenching. It was poignant, but not overtly manipulative.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|I was hoping for a movie as good as Iron Man or Transformers but this movie didn't have a good plot in my opinion, but it had awesome graphics!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing the game but don't like being stuck on one number for a month or longer, I wish it were a little easier getting pass these hard ones
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Perfect Game! Much better than the first and is one of the best games on Android. I fully recommend it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it ..been waiting for this !! This is a awesome game ..I think I'm addicted to candy crush ..awsome...love love love
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A true work out for you brain. Excellent and challenging. Does have clues when stumped so don't be scared to try. Very intoxicating.
0061950726|5.0|I read this for our book club, and can't wait for the discussion!  I loved how the two time periods were woven together. I had heard of the train before, but didn't realize it went on for 75 years and over 200,000 children rode it. Quite a history lesson!
B007REV4YI|5.0|The best of the new Bonds, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Also serves to introduce new characters for up-coming films.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|This game has been alot more challenging than some of the others I have played. I love the scenes and the intro to the game. The artistry is very intriguing. I would recommend it for a free play but am waitng for the other shoe to drop(Price).
B000002P2W|4.0|By Numbers is by far the most underrated The Who album out there.  They were in excellent form during this period.
0937381888|5.0|Great book for all levels of brewer. I will use this book frequently to reference back to on  my brew days
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|This game has so many colors that seems to stimulate the brain!  A lot of fun!  I would recommend this game!
B00G24KKAS|5.0|I love it and I hope everyone else does too! Better than waiting a year to see it on netflix.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Good for killing any productivity! I gave it 3 stars only because it killed a few deadlines for me :)
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|This season was hilarious! It's a bitter sweet season because it is the second to last but you know so much will be revealed next season. I can't wait to meet the mother and see how she'll fit in with the group.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I think it's ridiculous that you need friends help to play this game. I could only get so far in the game and then could jot continue unless I paid for it or asked friends off facebook to help me. I hate this feature in the game and therefore find it very annoying.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time you got an app for kindle!! Now I just need it comparable with my cell phone!! Easy instructions. Easy to play.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have a old LCD tv and did not have any way to connect my Samsung Note 2 with the TV. At the price point, Google Chromecast is a boon. Easy to set up and can connect to the TV's USB port for power - no dangling cables.<br />Upside - Online content or content from Google playstore can be played directly on the large screen TV. Basically, I don't need to buy a TV with internet connectivity anymore.<br />Downside - Does not have apps that plays content / media directly from the phone. Cannot replicate the screen on the TV, so you cannot play games on the large screen. I hope Google addresses both these items soon.<br />At the price point, I don't see why anyone will go for an apple TV.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I have enjoyed the wealth of strong characters in this show. There is a depth to most of them, not just caricatured good guys or bad guys.
B000FC1192|5.0|It has been years since I've had the time to sit for hour after hour and enjoy a good book. I read this book in one sitting and loved it. It is about a girl who walks through a door into am alternate realm based off her own world. But it is creepier and with her \\"other mother\\" who has buttons for eyes and wants to keep Coraline as her own button-eyed daughter and will do anything to keep her on this side of the door.<br />This book has a magical feel to it and yet is equally haunting as well. It could easily give me nightmares, but yet I find myself in awe. The language is simple, as though you are going back in time, thinking like a child.<br />It is geniously written, really, with each word precisely placed and nothing wasted.<br />You must read \\"Coraline.\\"
1594745692|5.0|I love everything about this deck.  The feel of the cards and the box is so smooth.  The artwork is fun and insightful.  The description book is thorough and concise with a bit of comic relief.  It is my favorite deck by far.
B004U8ZH8S|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, I had never seen it before but its a good family fun movie. I recommend it.
145210655X|5.0|If you're a fan and you are raising a padawan, this is a must. It is a hardcover and the pages are quality. It can survive a spill or two but I still hate to spill anything on it. Take a peek into it's page preview and judge for yourself but it seriously is funny. The author takes everyday dad experiences and puts a SW twist. Only a SW fan/dad would really appreciate this! Love it!
B008UX8G5A|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was so fascinating and detailed and very well written.  It is always so difficult to read these types of books because you get lost in the &#34;family tree&#34; of the royal families and the court but this book has a way of keeping you clear on who is who throughout the entire book.  MUST READ!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|One of my favorite all-time productions for quality on all levels. I particularly enjoy the performances and sets. A fair and faithful adaption of Jane Austen's novel.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Helps to make my Kindle more versatile.  Easy to use.  Haven't had any other product of this type to compare it to, it's a standard, basic calculator.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I truly enjoyed this piece.  It reminds me of an adult version of The Giver, a childhood favorite.  It was a page turner through the very end!  (And a great value as well)
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book is much better the second time around. The first time I read it I thought it was a waste of time & money, but the second time you realize the characters development is played out very nicely in this underrated book.
0060589280|5.0|This is a great book on love and navigating all that is not love to get to the final prize. And of course, about understanding sexuality.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I did not finish the book.  It got a little boring.  Some parts were good, and then there were the others that was not so good.
1476727651|5.0|I really enjoyed Stephen King's latest - Dr. Sleep, which is somewhat of a sequel to The Shining. The book holds your interest to the point where you don't want to put it down, and has, perhaps, one of the best villains of all his novels. I highly recommend the book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Love the books. Second time to read them.  It does have a good story to it.  There is too much sex, not believeable.
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Great mob movie. Well written and acted Ray Liotta at his best. Robert DeNiro rocks. JOE Pesci, so I amuse you bit on of the best of all time
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am on the third book now.  I have enjoyed the story.  I skip a lot of the &#34;Play Room&#34; writings. I have read the three books twice, once when it first came out, and now again since I heard they were making a movie.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|The Last Ship by Sting may be prophetic. It is definitely different from his previous works, and requires somebody talented in reviewing music for a fair appraisal. As Sting explains, the emphasis is on the shipyard workers in the town where he was raised. This two disc set is a break from the traditional works the British introduced here for publication during the latter half of the previous century, and I love listening to all of that. Working as a common laborer all my life, we had our favorite bawdy lyrics, and some new ones may exist here within this collection of British stories of ships and sailing. One word of caution, these discs are using newer technology, and they twisted up my Windows 7 player requiring the use of a paper clip to release the intense mechanical binding within. Have never had that happen before. A newer player provided with my Windows 8 laptop plays these disks completely and entirely free of any problems.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Play all the time........clear fast easy does not crash so far love passing the time. Candy crush.  Is great
B00821OX98|5.0|I loved it, just wish there were more of it on Amazon prime, I am ready for another season to be posted so i can watch more, since I don't have cable or sat.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read all his books and this one is another page turner. Happy to see some of the characters from A Time to Kill return for another appearance.
B00136Q2KW|5.0|Love it l wouldn't shop anywhere else to get my music. Awesome place to shop l would tell anyone there is no better place
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been avoiding this game until my daughter made me play it. so much fun! you will not regret it is more than the clasic connect three game. they definately designed this game to keep our interest
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I can't stop playing. Great variety and goals to attain. I wish mire was awarded for winning a bingo. But otherwise,I love everything about this app.
B0000844I8|5.0|Stargate is very good.I was lucky to see it in the theatre. With the plot keeping my interest, I can reccommend this film whole heartedly. You can tell why this became such a successful series.
B00E0SX118|4.0|We saw this movie first in the theater & found it worth owning. My children ages 2-17 loved it. Even dad liked it. That makes it a hit in my book.
B004INNRFK|5.0|David Foster always gives a spectacular show with such a variety of artists as well as the music of a true genius.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Thanks to the ones that put this together!  A sincere thank you for all the time and hard work put in to make this possible.
B00ESF285S|5.0|Such a nice book... a timeless classic for all those finishing an important period of their lives and beginning a more important one.
0375851569|5.0|Wonderful first collection of Dr. Seuss's books.  Love that they come in a little &#34;jacket box&#34; keeps them all together. My great grandson loves to listen while we read to him. so happy I bought them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works well. I have not had the opportunity to use it much yet, but it it good for the money.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|Katy Perry rules!<br /><br />Her first two albums were so awesome, especially \\"Teenage Dream\\", but \\"Prism\\" is even better.<br /><br />I bought this album twice because I pre-ordered it on Amazon but then I had to get the special deluxe package from her website so I could get the purple eye of the tiger jacket.<br /><br />I love \\"Roar\\" so much.  It's one of the best songs ever.<br /><br />The rest of the album is amazing too though.<br /><br />Dark Horse, This Is How We Do, and International Smile are three of the most addictive songs ever.<br /><br />A lot of her work on her has a really European sound and reminds me of some of Sophie Ellis-Bextor's best songs.  I feel like Katy Perry is kind of like the American Sophie Ellis-Bextor.  They are two of the most glamorous, talented, and totally awesome women ever.<br /><br />I think the one star reviews of this album are totally mean and unwarranted, and also just unfair.<br /><br />I wish I could make the katy haters disappear.  Like in that episode of the Twilight Zone when that kid has psychic powers and he can wish people away into the corn fields.  If I was that kid I would totally wish all katy haters away so that they no longer existed.<br /><br />Besides the other songs I mentioned I think \\"This Moment\\" is amazing.  I've only heard this album about forty times already so I'm sure the more I listen to it the more I will get into some of the other songs.<br /><br />It's really hard to get past \\"This Is How We Do\\" because I will end up repeating it like fifty times and not have time to get to the rest of the album.<br /><br />OMG.  I LOVE Katy Perry.  How is it possible for somebody to be this amazing?  It's insane.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Basic and  easy to use. I recommend this  app for all users , young and old. Try it and you will find it very  useful.
B00CJGP116|4.0|I don't know much Spanish but I do enjoy this album.  It is energizing and seems like a come back.
B004L03B3S|5.0|very touching beautifully acted love storymade me cry I will watch it over and over again...love happens sometimes unexpectedly true love
B00F2362IE|1.0|It took a couple of days to get this game to download.  My daughter started playing and the app kicked her out and now my Kindle is frozen.  = (
B0064MGU98|5.0|I watched all four seasons in one week. Terrible name but amazing show. Much better than any other legal procedural on TV
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game keeps my 4 year old entertained, I haven't played the app myself but see that she collects points(coins) and unlocks new levels.  She loves animals and this game seems harmless.
B00881VLCE|5.0|My Grandmother use to by me crossword puzzles when I was a little girl. Although her puzzles were much larger. They still remind me of her.
B006H3MJ7G|4.0|I like the remake of the song &#34;Stand by Me&#34;.  This is a nice CD, I am familiar with the artists music.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret merged the lives of three different families into a unique interplay based on choices made.  Liane Moriarty sets a solid pace throughout the book to keep the reader engaged.  It also defined how our lives and the people we know and love are not always what they seem.  The twist and turns in the story exposes the reader to the fragility of relationships and that the outcomes are not always what we expect.  The prologue was especially poignant in giving the reader a glimpse into what might have happened if events had been different.  A very good read.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I play this both on FB and on my Android phone - it's THAT addictive! My only complaint is the amount of lives you get, which is 5...then when you expend those lives, you have so wait SOOOO long for your lives to refill, unless you have friends to send you free lives. ALSO, you only get to sample some of the in-game boosts and unless you're willing to spend money on this game, it's kind of a downer for your game and you can be stuck on a level for MONTHS!<br /><br />One improvement could be letting the player EARN game boosters - the amount of points we earn per level can be used to PURCHASE more boosters, just like in Jewel Match (another favourite game of mine). I understand that the developers want to keep things challenging, but there are apparently over 300 levels (I'm currently stuck on level 147!). Getting to that high a level is challenge enough!<br /><br />Overall, an awesome game. I mean, if I have it on BOTH my computer AND my phone, it's GOT to be good!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Buy time? Lots of fun, pass the time. BUT what's with the buying feature? Wait and buying is annoying. Sheesh
1439153663|1.0|I can't understand why the author would write a book with so much tragedy and despair. I realize that we live in a world where this kind off suffering takes place, but so many horrific tragic things happening to one girl? one family? It was too much and it was unbearable to read not only because of the tragic events but because of the stupid people who didn't act upon it. They remained ignorant and helpless by choice. The choice not to communicate their feelings or reach out for help from each other was not consistent with what the author communicated were the dynamics of this slave family who loved and sacrificed so much for each other. The secrets that were kept hurt more in the end--it ruined any chance for any of these characters true happiness. Yes, that's correct, not one character is this book gets a happy ending. All characters endure one or more of the following tragedies. Rape, molestation, death of a loved one, abuse, drugs, violence, incest, starvation,loneliness, mental illness, neglect and the list goes on and on.<br /><br />Orphaned, sent to live be raised by slaves, \\"Vinny\\" experiences some horrible things. And up until the very last page of the book is left alone, and suffering from her past.<br /><br />Belle's story was ridiculous to me. Why would her father keep her identity as his daughter secret? Instead he would rather his wife and son believe she was his \\"whore\\"? Hmmm that makes no sense at all. Everyone who knows keeps the Cap'n secret until the very end when they tell Marshall to keep him from hurting his half sister. Why now? There was plenty of hurt going on way before the secret finally came out and way too late I might add hence the more depressing drama of this book. Belle, also doesn't get her choice of man to Love. That's okay though because Ben, Belle's love interest has a girl he can jump the broom with have sex with raise children with all at the same time of still loving Belle. Belle finally relents to letting Ben have sex with her when ever he wants at the same time  keeping his wife Lucy pregnant and happy as well. Belle is raped by her half brother has his child and is almost killed by him when their son shoots and kills him with a shot gun. I kind of feel for Marshall this boy whos father never had time for him, and didn't protect him from being molested and hurt by his tutor. A mother who didn't acknowledge him and blamed him for his sisters death. He had the likes of a mean cruel man Rankin befriend him to further educate him in the ways a man should beat and abuse women, get drunk and hate. He really was a messed up character.<br /><br />Marshall the son of the Cap'n is eleven and gets molested and beaten by the tutor his father has employed so that Marshall will man-up and be accountable. Hmmm..ok. well, the slaves of the plantation notice something going on with the tutor and Marshall and try to intervene, but the Cap'n doesn't want to hear it and the slaves are afraid they will be sold so they keep their mouth shut all the while he's being repeatedly molested.<br /><br />The author didn't really create any love or intimacy with her characters. They were dull and flat feeling. Mama Mae and Papa were the most feeling and loving of the bunch and there was Will who was a good guy, but again none of these characters were passionate about anything enough to do something. Will loved Lavinia? Really? How did that come about? And if he did why not fight for her? Did he love Belle too? But didn't act upon it only because he couldn't? Not explained well enough. And Belle and Ben where is the love story? There is no real build up of any of these relationships at all. Marshall kept sleeping with Beattie is that because he had actual feelings for her or was he just following in his father's foot steps and having affairs with slaves. Did Marshall ever care about Livinia? Or was he incapable of Love because of his messed up childhood and as a result of being molested? Again no real story development of the characters. Just a story of where the author tried to cram in as amny depressing, shocking, disturbing tragic events to make the reader want to scream out in frustration for wasting four hours of reading it.<br /><br />Can not recommend this book unless you are a sadist and get off on feeling others suffering and pain, if you do you will love this book.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read - period. Told from the point of view of an anguished mother whose son has recently committed a horrendous crime, it explores the often taboo questions associated with parenthood, and motherhood specifically. Can a child be &#34;born bad&#34; or are their personalities and deeds a sum of nurture rather than nature? While not an easy read, especially for a parent, it will make you question everything you know about love and family. This is a book I will be thinking of for years.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I missed some of the dialog because there was no closed captioning.  The story was interesting and the actors did a great job.
B00EF460ME|2.0|i expected more from this app. i need more maybe i should invest in some better headphones. but for the price i guess it ok.
B00DQAM5LI|4.0|This is a very good CD by A7X.It comes out of the gate strong and it would've gotten a 5 star rating but the last 2 songs bring it down a star.This Means War is a song that will remind you of Metallica and Coming Home is a great tune.This CD is definitely worth buying !
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My five year old granddaughter loves this game. She is only at my home one or two days a week but is stuck on this when she is here and worries about her pets when not here so nana has to take care of them for her (and I really don't mind)
1616550414|5.0|This is as awesome as you would want. A must purchase for any Zelda fan. The artwork throughout is amazing
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Get Pet Saga now and make my world complete! I hope you continue to get more King games! I love my Kindle Fire
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Great movie. Not my favorite one of the series, but still very funny and had a lot of kick ass action.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|the dolls are much like the TV series, their faces and their wardrobe. moreover, the material they are made is highly resistant.<br />my daughter seemed fabulous
B00005O3VC|5.0|I thought I had the wrong movie at first but it was just another extra that I didn't know about.  The bonus items are fantastic.  The color is much, much better and the sound is alot better this time around.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Much fun. Would do again soon.  Try it and see if you like her antics. It was fun to watch with my sweetheart.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|It was a great book, kept me interested up to the end.  Will read more of Susan's books very soon.
B0081336FO|5.0|Love the casting, the witty dialogue, the actors/acting, the plots! Always kept me guessing. The best Sherlock and Dr, Watson ever
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Great product for what it does, which isn't much.  I was aware of that when I bought it, but I thought I would be able to use it with the Google Chrome browser on my iOS or Android tablets.  However, when I try to install the Chrome Cast Extension I get a message that neither of these operating systems is supported.  I can understand why they may not be in a hurry to support Apple devices, but they apparently don't yet support their own devices either.  At this point it doesn't appear to do anything that my ROKU doesn't do.  Have I missed something?
B002QVZ71I|3.0|I hate Tom Hanks, but he is a good actor and this show is interesting, if highly unprobable. Some of the lines have become part of our national culture.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie with my family. It has a good message and is very funny throughout. Can't wait to see the sequel.
B005LLSZNM|3.0|This series makes me cringe, the violence and idea of glorifying &#34;bad guys&#34;--yet the acting and plots are intriguing enough, I keep coming back for more. This show is definitely not your &#34;same old-same old&#34;
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|The truly complete version of the film, with the previously missing scenes restored.<br /><br />Robert Duvall is amazing as Col. Kilgore, the commander that you new would make it though without a scratch.<br /><br />An amazing pre-computer effect film that grips you and never lets go.
B000QRIGLC|3.0|This book brought tears to my eyes. I did not know how intense the training was to become a seal and what they went trough.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My friend referred this book to me and was trying to explain that Death was the narrator. I was confused but after the first few pages I was hooked and it clearly falls into one of my favorites ever  category
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Remember that game that your mom loved in the 90s? Well, this is exactly like that game, except they expect you to pay real money for power ups, progressing levels and even to fail more than any levels 5 within 20 minutes.<br />Total BS of a game.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|To be fair I am not a huge fan of Grisham. I find his books to be shallow, with one dimensional characters that I just don't care about. This book follows the same formula as all of his others. You have the poor innocent, down trodden person who is rescued from the evil conservative by a pure minded liberal democrat atty. The only character with any depth or complexity, happens to be dead. The rest are just card board cut outs. Snore.<br /><br />Grisham's books use to be interesting. A Time to Kill was a great read, as was the Pelican Brief. Sycamore Row is just another retelling of the same old story, but the names have been changed to put money in the writer's bank account.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Its always like seeing my brother again when I start reading a new SK novel. Safe and snug wherever I am, ( I travel with my job)his voice almost genetically (?s) familar, I' m ready to let him take me<br />Somewhere twisted but curiously like home. Comming home to Danny this time..  I loved the book. And I<br />  Loved the end. The only thing I had trouble with, and it could have been me, was I had trouble FEELIN the true and their malice as well as I usually can.  I suspect it was me. HAIL TO THE KING! LUV YA STEPHEN!
B004TJ1H3C|1.0|Got to the last disk in the final season and it doesn't even play. Skips and freezes the whole way through. Disk has big scratches
B00DICGK24|4.0|I heard it was good, but never saw it.  I really like the movie. I never really knew much about Bobby Fischer until now.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another thoroughly enjoyable story. She makes it so interesting you can't put it down. I hope there will be many more.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I loved the movie.  It was funny, filled with suspense, sad, encouraging.  You felt yourself rooting for the guy to be saved! Great scenery.
0307730700|4.0|This is a great biography of a simple person made a hero. Adam Brown was, for all those who knew him, going to burn himself out with a life style of drugs and bad living. But when he made up his mind to be a Seal, and once he married a woman who stood by him, he was able to achieve great things. He also had a strong faith in God and knew life did not end when he died.<br />  Adam gave life all he had. He was a great father,great husband,and a great Seal. I would recommend this biography for people who want to know what a hero looks like.<br />[[ASIN:0307730700 Fearless: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown]]
B00ENYKBD0|4.0|Insightful but Hollywood dramatized.<br />A Beautiful Mind is a must see for psychology students majoring in clinical and abnormal psychology. A true story, however employing excessive application of morbid irises, this move reveals the suffering of those afflicted with schizophrenia.<br />I give it a 4 because of the excess application of behaviors which covered the near full spectrum of symptoms - not realistic.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I purchased this book during a work transition, and it was just what I needed at the time  He is a good writer, and, though I don't agree with some of his ideas, he helped me refine my new self-employment strategy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed this book. It was original and heartfelt. Takes on a journey into the human Psyche through the eyes of a dog.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So fun and always mAking me strategize! Love playing this game. Keep up the awesomeness!!!!  How many more levels do you have?
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It's an amazing book, and difficult to set aside once you begin reading!  Yes, it is proof of heaven and then some!
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was different, definitely entertaining, and I am now watching the series on Netflix.  It is really great and funny.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|Alan did a great job bringing Gabriela and Jim to life. The dialogue and character interaction was so detailed, I could \\"see\\" the scene unfold in my mind. This mature story is a quick and enjoyable read.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is almost perfect but they should add more energy at the beginning of the game and through out the game for more gameplay.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome game five stars. so much fun. cant get enough. will tell all. I love this game. I have to play before I go to bed.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Fantastic read!  This is a book that I could read over and over.  Highly recommend The Heroin Diaries.  I read it in less than two weeks with a full time job, family, and going to college.  Totally worth it!
B007EC27QM|5.0|I rated this a five star because of the ease of use. The Large keys for older folks are great.

1608871827|5.0|I was tired of waiting for Barns and Noble to get in their new shipment of the art book, so I took matters into my own hands and bought it here. I got the book for a cheaper price and the free shipment was great! This is the first movie I ever wanted to buy an art book for and I love it!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|One of the funnest and best shows!  My wife and I have really enjoyed this show.  Can't wait for season 4!
B00EAI9CSY|5.0|This movie was well written, with amazing actors. I loved how it wasn't your typical vampire movie that we have all seen before.
0385351399|5.0|If you're an internet addict or immersed in the world of social media, you'll struggle to put this down. Eggers has done it again.<br /><br />Hashtag loved it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|good movie keeps you alert,like the action,plus all my favorite super heroes, the hulk was awesome I'd watch it again.
B000055YG6|5.0|The casting and acting in this movie are brilliant.  It won five academy awards including Best Picture.  It centers around the superficial outward appearance of beauty and success radiated by an American family of three and the sharply contrasting reality of its inner workings.  An impression left for the viewer's imagination includes the idea that the family once was beautiful and successful, but that the mental state of all three has declined through boredom and other factors to its present dismal state.  The father is Lester (Kevin Spacey) who seems to have lost his moral compass and has adopted the philosophy that nothing really matters.  His wife Carolyn projects the image of being in control of her life, but realizes the warmth in her marriage is gone and she's becoming desperate for meaning.  The daughter is Jane (Thora Birch) whose self esteem is disappearing and believes she's unattractive.  Jane falls in love with neighbor Ricky  (Wes Bently) who sells drugs and wants a career in the movie industry.  Ricky is regularly beaten to a pulp by his super-macho ex-marine father Colonel Fitts (Chris Cooper).  Lester falls in love with one of Jane's high school girlfriends, tries to seduce her in his own home and approaches the ultimate success when she panics and triggers a joint freeze-out.  Rick gets sick of his regular beatings and leaves home, taking Jane with him.  Lester is numb from his own experiences when neighbor Colonel Fitts has a meltdown and wanders over to Lester begging for tenderness, hugging and possibly a more intimate relationship.  The movie is loaded with light and dark humor along with significant bursts of total degradation.  Viewers who love dark humor will adore this movie.  Those who wince at the sight of degradation might do well by forgetting it.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Great movie been watching it since i was a kid,I'll watch it over and over.Just a classic a lot of very good actors
B00F0XATY4|5.0|Just buy this and listen, it's the Band at the top of their game. Great mix, wonderful songs. As perfect as a document of The Band could ever be.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was one of the best books I read all year! I loved it right from the start and couldn't put it down!
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|As per my 11 year old son:<br /><br />I like how you can play on the &#34;pork side&#34;.  This means that the pigs are in the slingshot.  The birds were always in the slingshot, so it is cool to try something new.  I like the boss battles where the boss pig or bird fights the others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A friend recommended me this game, due to my love of horses. I've played some pretty boring horse games, but this one doesn't fall into that category. It doesn't rely on a pay-to-win format, and is pretty easy to pick up. I would highly suggest this to anyone looking for a good game.
B007A6XLDU|5.0|I decided to try this app because I needed to take notes on my Kindle Fire HD instead of investing in a different tablet. This did the trick.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is awesome and addicting. I just wish we didn't run out of lives so fast. It's so much fun!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed reading Gone Girl. I am a fan of stories that put you on an emotional roller coaster. First you think one character was guilty, then you read on and you change your mind as the story unfolds. It keeps you in suspense. The only thing I didn't like was that I thought it ended abruptly. Maybe that was an opening for a sequel?
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Despite it being on Netflix currently, I liked having it on DVD.  The 3rd season definitely adds more to the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's such a fun, addictive I mean I'm playing all the time!! Also everyone on my Facebook can't get enough of Candy Crush!!
B00FXEL00W|5.0|What lesbian has never dealt with loving a best friend or, worse, loving someone who just couldn't come out? The Gravity Between Us is a charming romance capable of endearing it's readers to the characters as well as addressing several problems homosexuals face on the contemporary world. I recommend this quick read to any lesbian romance lovers out there and hope to see more of Zimmer's work in the near future.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|I choose this rating because I see first hand everyday what the authors are talking about. I deal with workers who don't have the skills to do the basic job they been hired for, and don't want to change. They scared of the change. They know they can't keep up, nor do they desire, or want too. At the same time, in order to be globally competitive, we have to change, that is the bottom line. The few are making the change because they are tried of having to do the work of others.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I read this in school when I was young and I remember liking it.  I decided to read it again as an adult and I like it even more now.  This is an absolutely outstanding book for anyone, young/old, male/female it doesn't matter.
B00AEFXQ9S|4.0|Bought for my dad because he really liked the movie and theory of the plot. Over all a good movie I'd say.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Great seller.  Received very quickly and on time.  I use to watch this with my grandson who now has a son of his own.  So I bought this for his son .  Now I get to watch it again with my great-grandson.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Good moral movie I'd say teaches family values as well which is really good. All around great heart felt family movie.
0345530578|5.0|Once I finished the novel I wanted it to keep going. John Grisham's books always come through in grabbing my attention. This one didn't disappoint.
B006G3JPWO|5.0|Awesome movie! Really enjoyed it.  Appropriate for kids! Great Halloween movie... Gets you in the mood to trick or treat!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have probably read every novel ever written by Stephen King. Some I dearly loved and others left me disappointed. I recall enjoying &#34;The Shining&#34; many years ago so I took a chance on King's latest novel and I am happy to report that I was not disappointed. &#34;Doctor. Sleep&#34; is King at his finest. Dan Torrence and Abra are well developed characters. We are given plenty of background on them and really come to care about what happens to them and their friends.The side story about Dan's struggle with alcoholism and the help he gets from his friends in the Alcoholics Anonymous program was detailed enough to make me think that King has intimate knowledge of this disease and the AA program. The &#34;monsters&#34; in this book are very different from any we've met before. They are vampire like creatures who thrive on the essence derived from torturing and killing special children, like Danny and Abra, who shine. But when these monsters are not feasting on the essence of these special children they live like any other group of retired RV dwellers. They even seem to actually love each other and think that they are somehow entitled to thrive at the expense of the children. Rose the Hat is one of King's most terrifying protagonists. I have often found myself feeling a desire to find out more about some of King's characters. I have wanted to look them back up after a number of years to find out whatever happened to them.In &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; King let me follow little Danny Torrence into his adulthood. He brought back some of the characters from &#34;The Shining&#34; and he introduced new characters as well. He even managed to throw in some monsters for whom we could even feel a little compassion.
0525950079|5.0|I had never read any of Ken's books until i read Pillars and World without end (both are amazing books) World without end takes the reader on a journey back in time to Kingsbridge in medieval England, i have read many books over the years of a similar subject matter (my favorite time in history to read) and i can honestly say this book and the first one (Pillars) were by far the best i have read. few books have immersed me as these have. some people here have commented about the use of language used in the book not being accurate to the middle ages and that is true, but if he had used the common language of the time it would have made reading this book very difficult for most readers (including myself) being historical FICTION i had no problem with this and am sure that this was intended by Follett., i am not a reviewer or critic, just a fan and i would highly recommend both of these books by Follett.
0688014291|5.0|Easy and quick to read only took my 2 hours loved the concept and great for wanting to become a manager book.

B005804NCI|5.0|Japanese version in SACD format.  Includes Silver Springs track by Stevie Nicks that was not included on the original Rumours.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It has been a long time since I picked up a Scarpetta novel. This one was entertaining though if you didn't know the characters out may have been a slightly confusing read. Fast paced, complicated and always entertaining to read from the viewpoint inside Dr. Scarpetta's head.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great a sad ending but good otherwise. it was very moving and the story actually had a meaning. So great altogether
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very challenging!!  I really enjoy playing this game with my daughter.  Great bonding time.  Keep them coming!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Pure entertainment!  Grishom can squeeze more curves and fast balls into a novel than a reader can handle. A I didn't put this one down until the end!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to play on my kindle. I am so happy that it's finally available.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I truly loved this book although parts of it were very sad.  The perspective on dying by teenagers with cancer was so enlightening.  How they felt not only about themselves, but also their parents, friends, and each other was spot on.  There was also parts of the book that made me laugh out loud.  All in all, it was very well written and I highly recommend it.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|I didn't even read the book but there's somethingy called the berg?just saying something weird might happen in dis book
B009CCBCU4|4.0|This might be a good series for younger readers, especially since the main characters are teens. The history seems valid, and all of the characters are pretty believable.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Great and fast arrival time great condition wish they would come out with a true box set one of the best horror films of all time
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|seek and find, great time waster!  only wish last longer during play time.  if you like a game that has you chekjnv in daily this game is for you!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I've never been disappointed by an episode. I recommend this to all with good taste and enjoyment of English history.
B004V43ZQC|4.0|I've really enjoyed it so far. It bounces around quite a bit but each chapter sucks you back in within a couple of paragraphs!
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|This is a great movie. Russel Crowe is fantastic in it. This is definitely one of my favorite movies, even though if you don't like blood and gore it probably is not for you. There are some intense scenes that could distrube some people. But the story line is great and the characters are well develop. If you are looking for a good action/drama movie this is perfect, but it is not in any means historically accurate.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|I like the diet. I know many, many people from various websites that have used this to lose a lot of weight and keep it off.  I have also been following this for a few weeks now, and find it very easy to follow.  I plan to follow for many more months to come.  I buy into the &#34;science&#34; behind intermittent fasting and reasoning for the way this diet is structured.<br /><br />My problem is that there was about 1/3 of this book's length worth of good material, and so they brought in another writer to &#34;fluff&#34; it up a great deal and add SOOOO many pages of recipes that I felt were completely useless.  Maybe they are not useless to others or to you, and that's fine.<br /><br />But anyway, I like the diet, really enjoyed about 1/3 of this book, but in absolutely no way is this book required to do this diet, unlike many others.<br /><br />Quite simply, as others have stated, eat 600 calories (if a man) twice per week, not-back to back, and eat reasonably normal the other five days.  Rinse, repeat, and watch weight slowly come off and the after-effects of teaching yourself real moderation on those two days actually carry over into the rest of your weekly diet, quietly and easily.
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|The movie streamed perfectly to my computer with no mess ups, but the actual movie was just okay. I would not pay money to actually buy or rent this movie again. I don't think it was worth it.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|I bought two of these for my kids. The are to big, the kindle does not fit well and they dont stay closed, My kids just ended up taking them off..Wasted my money.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|I was really disappointed when I tried to talk to Ben. He wouldent repeat anything i said and when I mixed the test tubes all of the times I mixed the 2, all the same things happened and I got really bored. HATE IT!!!!!!!!!
1451695195|4.0|It is een very interesting book that keeps you reading, it is good written.<br />You get to like the author because he is so honest.<br />What I don'nt like is that the commerce has gotten a grip on him, that 's<br />the reason I hold a little back in my rating.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I really loved this product especially the price!! I had these movies on VHS but needed them on DVD so I upgraded.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|This is good -- the man does amazing research -- but I liked His earlier book, The Outliers, a bit better!!
B00F880BWG|5.0|If you haven't seen this you are definitely missing a great series. I highly recommend that you start from the beginning and watch all the episodes, the stories are that good.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|Great read.  It felt like I got a backstage pass into the wonderful, animated, crazy world of chefs.  I also liked the conversational tone of the writing, and I learnt some interesting things that should definitely improve my restaurant experience in the future - why to never order steak well done, and the best days to order seafood at a restaurant.  I will definitely be reading more from Anthony Bourdain.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have been playing mahjong for years and this operates better than any... i love all the graphics and speed of this game as well... give it a try, you won't be disappointed...enjoy!
B00G32VYDG|1.0|Mary Louise Parker is almost hot enough to just look at her for the whole movie and say, wow what a good movie. However, she was not enough to make this a good movie. Skip it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Ms. Roth had a lot of opportunity with this book. But because of her huge readership, she had a lot of power and responsibility too. She needed to write a good story. I don't mean \\"write a happy story.\\" I mean write a good story as in one with a coherent plotline, robust characters, and emotional tension. These are simply the qualities that readers trust to get from Ms. Roth based on the first two novels, and it is in this point that Ms. Roth completely fails with Allegiant. We can see this from the many negative reviews: If you're going to kill off a main character, it had better make sense and not strike thousands of readers as arbitrary. If you're going to write in two voices (and sacrifice the ability to deeply understand one character's psyche), make sure that the voices are different enough that readers don't get confused. If you're going to create a power hungry character in Evelyn, don't make her transition at the end seem like it's a senseless and unbelievable 180-degree turn. Allegiant has none of the memorable and multi-dimensional characters that were introduced in books 1 and 2 (Nita is far less developed than Al or Johanna). The tension from the training fights and simulation attack in Divergent, as well as the tension in the attack on Erudite headquarters in Insurgent, are replaced by bumbling revolutions and counterrevolutions that do nothing more than alienate and confuse the reader into wondering \\"why do I care?\\" And on top of all this sloppy mess is the ending, written as if its aim is to shock this blustering treatise on eugenics into being a captivating novel.<br /><br />In his Nobel Prize speech William Faulkner said, \\"the poet's, the writer's, duty is to...help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.\\" Yes, Faulkner is probably not often cited in a YA novel review, but his words certainly resonate here. An author has a prerogative to tell a story, but also has a responsibility to help the reader care about the story. A good writer knows that you do this by making the story relatable and believable. Whether you're writing Nobel prize literature or a good YA story, you have to bring out basic human values like bravery or empathy in an authentic and relatable way. Readers need to say, \\"Even though I'm really different from the character, I understand why he/she did that because I can imagine what he/she feels like.\\" We know from the first two novels that Ms. Roth can write this way, but something is off in Allegiant because for all of its lip-service to bravery and self-sacrifice, it uses 500+ pages of fluff and still the Christ ending doesn't feel authentic, relatable or true to hundreds of reviewers.<br /><br />Let's talk a little more about that ending; my opinion about it is a little more personal. Author John Green recently tweeted that he wants \\"stories to show me a bigger world than the one I know.\\" And I completely agree. One of the things that annoyed me about this ending, however, was that it didn't show me a bigger world than what I know; it showed me what I already know. In real life I've lost people I love. I know how difficult it is to keep going, and so reading the end of this book felt like looking at a reflection. I don't need a book to remind me of the reality I live in every day. I need a book that shows \\"what's possible,\\" instead of \\"what's actual.\\" A \\"bigger world,\\" to me, implies hope. Hope that there could be a world in which senseless loss is not the norm. In which children don't have to deal with losing family, losing friends, losing hope like they do every day in the real world. Harvey Milk once ended a speech with the words, \\"you've got to give them hope.\\" I know that he was talking about a much more significant topic than a YA novel, but his words still fit. For me, and for the many real people who live with much more loss, destruction, war, and tragedy than I, we could use a little hope.<br /><br />All in all, this book is not worth the reader's time and emotional investment, and the experience of reading it completely threatens the value of the first two installments. So many reviewers say that this trilogy is not worth reading. But no one should finish a trilogy and think, \\"I wish I hadn't started the trilogy.\\" When the reader trusts an author enough to start a trilogy, it is the author's responsibility to finish that trilogy well. I wish we could go back in time and have the Ms. Roth who wrote the first two books rewrite the third book. That Ms. Roth understood how to write a good story and how to connect the reader to the story. I think that if she wrote this book using the same integrity with which she wrote the first two, hundreds of negative reviewers and I could feel enjoyment, satisfaction and contentment instead of disappointment, bitterness and regret.

B00FPH6A70|1.0|OK...If this movie is \\"Based\\" on a true story then here's what I believe REALLY went down.  This Mr. Warren fellow was a regular guy who happened to luck up and marry a girl whom he had been deeply in love with, a woman who was WAY out of his league physically...she also happened to be bat-s*** crazy.  So he does what any man would do in his situation, to please the crazy and keep the gravy train going in the bedroom, he went along with, and fed into her feminine delusions.<br /><br />She claims that she's \\"SEEING\\" ghosts and spirits and she's talking to dead people, and he, like a goof in love is just tagging along, enabling her obvious mental illness, even going as far as to become a self-proclaimed demonologist (WTF!!!).<br /><br />Why does it seem that when it comes to crazy stuff like this...believing in ghosts and spirits and demons and astrology and psychics, that females seem to always be in the center of it.  It's the most annoying thing in the world to me to hear a female talk this nonsensical, juvenile, psycho babble...maybe it's their period medicine, I don't know, but I know that it's extremely annoying...please ladies keep your psychotic delusions to yourselves.<br /><br />As far as movies go...I feel like I've seen this movie a thousand times already and it was an incredible waste of time.

B00C8S9VKM|5.0|It is hard to believe that so much could have happened during the summer of 1927.  Bryson has researched not just the main characters in this saga, but all of the events leading up to this summer, with the lives of many of the characters intersecting with the main characters.  As Bryson is prone to do, his research leads in many different directions, but his writing provides a clear picture of the culture at that time.  There were many surprises to me.<br /><br />If you aren't already an avid reader of Bill Bryson's books, pick any and you will be.
B00F031WB8|4.0|My review of Hear My Train A Comin<br /><br />First off, the showing I went to happened to also be attended by the director Bob Smeaton! Kind of cool! We got to ask him questions about the doc after it was over. Nice guy and very frank about the challenges of editing a doc like this one with so many voices and pieces of footage to choose from and showcase.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine job. Keep in mind that for us \\"Jimi heads\\" we've seen the vast majority of the footage that's out there in one form or another. The two or three biggest \\"new Jimi visuals\\" included in the doc are Miami (obviously) and we get nearly a complete performance of Foxy Lady. We also get snippets of Tax Free and plenty of footage of the Miami crowd. But given this is a documentary, you're going to have to wait for the \\"Extras\\" in order to really enjoy all of the new footage, including Isle of Fehrman, which is briefly shown in the doc when Jimi performs Spanish Castle Magic (with the audience tape the family released as the audio for the cut). We also get, for what was for me anyways, some previously unseen footage of Jimi performing in a full blue velvet get-up. I forget which concert this was taken from.<br /><br />The majority of the people interviewed in the doc have since passed on. Noel, Mitch, Chas, Paul Caruso, Buddy Miles, and a few more. Surprise, Faye Pridgeon is still around, so is Billy Cox (thank goodness), Linda Keith, but we still don't get any updated interview with Eric Barrett, unfortunately. Bob Smeaton mentioned that Eric didn't like how he was quoted in the original Jimi Hendrix biopic back in '73 and hence has never allowed himself to be interviewed on camera about Jimi since. Also, Leon chose not to be interviewed for this doc.<br /><br />Linda Keith summed up Jimi's two passions in his life: music and women! Won't debate it.<br /><br />I will mention, however, that towards the conclusion of the doc there is some beautiful guitar playing. And guess what it is? It's from One Rainy Wish and I guess Eddie Kramer or whomever it was made available Jimi's guitar from this gorgeous composition without the drums or any other instruments. When you hear it, it's like heaven! Just exquisite. I'd love to hear One Rainy Wish in its entirety without drums or bass. Just Jimi's soulful strumming. Maybe one day the family will release some additional outtakes of Axis and include Jimi's guitar parts from this tune without the added bass and drums.<br /><br />The doc runs close to two hours. The rest of the footage we've seen before. Bob relies heavily on the Dick Cavett interview. A good dose of Berkeley, Monterey, but barely any Newport! Some of the most gorgeous, exquisite blues playing EVER caught of Jimi performing live and Bob doesn't use ANY OF IT! (there's a second or two from the stage but it doesn't count in my book) Sacrilegious! Maybe the family is still waiting to release this stuff on something else. Or maybe it's on the Extras. I don't know. But it's footage that captures what for me is what makes Jimi the greatest R&B electric guitarist of all time. Whenever someone asks me, I just say, go watch Newport!<br /><br />It would have been super if Bob had bothered to get permission to include more footage from Maui. We get In From The Storm at the conclusion of the doc but man, we know there's much more, including Dolly Dagger and the instrumental that follows it. This is footage crying to be seen by the public at large, in particular, to show the more intricate and softer side of Jimi's playing.<br /><br />Also, the doc fibs when it's mentioned why Jimi got out of the Army. We know now that it wasn't a \\"broken ankle\\" that got Jimi his discharge. But that's minor. Also, there's zero mention of LSD, pot, drugs, etc....Bob told us that because there was no recorded interviews with Jimi about his taking any drugs he decided not to include any footage with other people who knew Jimi that mentioned his drug use. Fair enough. But I thinkLSD is an important drug (PERIOD) and LSD was an influence on Jimi when it came to some of his greatest compositions, including 1983. I seem to recall that there is a recorded interview with Jimi where he does discuss LSD (I could be mistaken).<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good production and we have to keep in mind that there are always new Jimi fans to initiate and many should find this doc a real delight.<br /><br />I can't WAIT to see the extras!!! This is what all Jimi heads are salivating the most about. More Miami, more Isle of Fehrman, more New York '70, yeah!LSD is an important drug (PERIOD) and LSD was an influence on Jimi when it came to some of his greatest compositions, including 1983.

B00FJ30OD6|5.0|the lead character has always been a tad on the goody two shoes side.  this was especially the way we found her in season 1, the political wife whose husband was using prostitutes.  so she had to go back to work as the lawyer she used to be. (the elliott spitz couple most closely resemble this situation) what i really like about season 5 is that the lead is at last allowed to be as assertive, aggressive and in your face as every other lawyer in this show. specifically, she goes ahead and does what the season closed with last year, that she and Cary were going to start their own firm. they are also planning on taking a lot of key clients with them. This is really good stuff and everyone gets very down and dirty.  unfortunately, michale j. fox left this show to go shoot his own show.  that is too bad.  i have seen his new show and this one was a much better vehicle for him. finally, if one thought alicia and peter had quite the meltdown couple wise, wait until you catch will's meltdown this season.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00G24KKAS|4.0|update to original review: i just saw the last episode and came back to my review and knocked it down a star. there is no getting around that the new person in charge of the series made a big mistake in deciding to take a big deviation from the comic book.  the comic book has lasted a decade because its author knows his characters really well. Thus his concept of governor was as a one shot limited villain. there was no need to go on and on with him as a depraved leader. unfortunately, that is what the new series creative director decided to do.  after three episodes of wallowing in the character of the governor, i was ready to scream.  the uk actor had done a nice job until he was overutilized to this extent.  i knew that the creative director for series three was let go for artistic differences with AMC but how could AMC have been so stupid as to think it could milk the governor to this extent?  i can only surmise that it got greedy and wanted to make more money out of the governor subplot. my eatlier review was before i saw three back to back episodes of wallowing in the character of the governor.  i had to come back and amend the review.  the series comes back in february and unfortunately, the same series director is in charge.  my original review reflects our starting out gloriously but i now have my doubts.  AMC was incredibly stupid to fire the guy in charge of making series three. he was perfect. at this point i only knocked it down one star. come february's return, it may lose another one...or two.<br /><br />my original review follows and it was way, way too optimistic.<br /><br />this began as a comic book by robert kirkwood and we are now up to the 115th issue.  the comic is also great.  right from the beginning of the tv show, there were some differences between the comic and show.  the biggest of these is that Darryl, one of the favorite characters on the show, did not exist in the comics.  Nor did his brother. I think everyone agrees this was a marvelous addition to the tv show. in season four though, we take a huge deviation from the comic series.  this deviation is keeping them at the prison and then having a second wave of illness, the flu, turn people into zombies as well. in the comic, they are gone from the prison after the whole story arc of the governor. they are en route to somewhere else and there is no flu. so keeping them at the prison and introducing this flu like disease to invade their ranks is a huge turn into a story line which simply does not exist in the comic. having said all of this, i don't think this deviation is hurting the show in the slightest. all of these new developments are making for great weekly viewing. one other difference going on is that the comic kills off different people from the tv show.  the biggest deviation which occurred there was the comic has a character as Rick's love interest who was killed off in last season of the tv show!<br /><br />i frankly have always hated the zombie concept. yet i couldn't believe how good this show and comic were.  nor could i believe how good Max Brooks' novel was, WORLD WAR Z. I think that what makes these work is that they are more about human beings going on against overwhelming, catastrophic odds. they manage to form a community, pick a leader, try and make a future for themselves and mankind.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B001QB5S3G|5.0|This movie is so well done and such a thought provoker on so many levels. I really recommend it for everyone.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I had seen periodic episodes of this series on network TV and it always seemed like a good show. So when I saw the entire series was available for FREE with Amazon Prime, I began watching the series from the beginning. I've been on a marathon watching spree for a couple weeks and have made it through the first three seasons. I'm hooked!<br /><br />The series is well-written, the casting is perfect and the acting performances are believable and cohesive. The storyline covers the personal and professional life of Alicia Florrick, the wife of the former state attorney. Her husband is caught in a political scandal revealing numerous sexual affairs and allegations of corruption in his office. He is imprisoned and Alicia finds herself back in the workplace after 13 years away raising her children. She is hired into the firm by a college acquaintance, Will Gardner. The two have had a history of attraction for each other but focus on their professional work. The series presents numerous legal cases and hurdles handled by the firm all while the backstory of politics (both governmental and office) and romances play out between the characters. The show also injects small bits of humor throughout without compromising the integrity of the drama. I particularly like the show's portrayals of quirky justices. The storyline is fantastic and always has me pining for the next episode. And I hear that the show only gets better from here..
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The book was well written its just not my favorite time period. I rate it low so my recommendations pull historical novel from different eras in European history.

B0036S4B6M|2.0|I wanted to like this book because I thoroughly enjoyed the NetFlix series. After reading the book, however, all I was left with is the feeling that Piper Kerman learned nothing from her time in prison and is a self-centered, overly indulged white female with a sense of superiority and entitlement over her fellow inmates. Over and over again, she brings up that while she did indeed serve her 1 year sentence, she was probably the coolest inmate at Danbury FCI, she was educated at Smith, she's white & blonde and in her \\"humble\\" opinion, pretty. She does pay lip service to the injustices of the federal justice system and that she's \\"sorry\\" that her actions may have resulted in someone else's harm... but the reader still gets the feeling that Kerman thought she was above it all, then & now. If you're purchasing the book because you think it's just like the TV show, think again... and don't waste your time or money.

B000I8ERVC|2.0|I found this movie to be very slow and boring.  I'm not sure what the point of it really was.  Hopper was stoned or drunk all the time, and Fonda seemed like he was about to have a breakthrough sometimes, but it never really made it.<br />HATED the ending.  Sure it did happen and can still happen but that doesn't mean I have to like it.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|nice to know i can never scratch or lose this movie, suggest this form of purchase for those always traveling.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It is quite good.  Many characters and it moves from one group of characters to the next.  You have to work to keep up with each story, which is a challenge I like.  The characters were very interesting.  The plot ended up to be a little far-fetched at the end, but I liked the writing and the stories challenges.
0307730700|5.0|This is a well-written story about a tremendous young man who gave the ultimate sacrifice serving God, family, and country.  Most books about Navy SEALs spend several chapters discussing the rigors of BUD/S training, but Blehm glossed over this (we all know it's hard!) to get to the real point, which is that Adam Brown was an amazing man who dug himself out of a deep hole with the help of God and his loving family, then served his country in an exemplary way.  He was a devoted family man who did what he thought was right.  I think every man over the age of 13 should read this book!
B0026IUXME|4.0|I'm not sure why, but the playback quality of this digital movie was really poor. I did not rent it in HD, but nor do I ever, and this is by far the worst quality movie I've ever streamed. It looked like I was watching a bootlegged copy.

B00BB22GQM|5.0|I enjoy the slowed down pace of this album as compared to there first two.  The lyrics are still catchy and music is still very good but it seems more mellow than the bands previous endeavors.
B005LAIIMG|3.0|The zombie makeup was good.  The scene where the zombies all stack up against the wall and then flow over the wall had a pretty good creep factor.  But mostly I felt like I was watching a lukewarm rehash of the much better Walking Dead. Not anything like the book which was pretty neat to listen to.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love the premise of this storyline.  Two cities that are close to each other with those from wealth and the tenants to the Squire and landlord.  It revolves around the postoffice where Dorcas is mistress and cousin to one of the tenants in Lark Rise.  Candleford is where the postoffice is located and as a favor to her cousin, Dorcas takes on Laura Timmons, the eldest daughter.  Twists and turns revolve around the love interest between Dorcas and Timothy the Squire (who is married to some else).  Then there is William, the starch, stern religous man who is a mail carrier and Zilla the house maid (who looks older then dirt and is set in her ways as well).  Much fun, romance and underlying polotics take you and a fun-filled journey in Lark Rise to Candleford.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|Great show!!! Can watch it again, again, again, again, again, again and again. Never will get tried of the Moderen Family tribe
B004GJDQT8|4.0|If you are a user of the amazon store you will find everything you need plus guidelines on how tho make the best of the icon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Lovely writing with language that is a pleasure to read.  Flynn easily toys with readers, deftly adjusting the book's tone from moment to moment with subtle and unexpected touches.  Every new page feels like a clue to &#34;what's really going on&#34; in the mystery, and each disclosure makes you revise your expectations about what will come next - only to reverse those expectations completely a few chapters later.  Several major twists make the plot pop; these twists seem impossible at first, but Flynn shows you how they were not only possible but in fact inescapable.  Flynn also takes the opportunity for some farce about how sensational and judgmental the public/media reaction to suspected domestic homicide cases can be, including a Nancy Grace-like character. You will burn through this compelling book and marvel at the craftsmanship that went into its writing.<br /><br />However, for me the story was rather distressing, which is why I only gave 4 stars.  The dead-on portrait of an unraveling relationship was hard to read, as were the seriously messed-up motivations and dynamic of the main characters.  I prefer to read a book that reinvigorates me; this book was draining.  Granted, I don't normally read thrillers so perhaps this sort of story just isn't for me.  It also bothered me that Nick and Amy's voices felt very similar - they had very different things to say, but said them with nearly the same syntax.<br /><br />Still, I would recommend this book if you are looking for a dark, lovely, masterfully crafted novel.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I have this game on my Pc...  I like solitaire and card games so this is the perfect game if you like these type of games. it is very entertaining.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|This series just keeps on pleasing. If it were the true ending like it was suppose to be then it would've been a good ending. I really liked the &#34;Explosive&#34; finale.
B00FWLSOOG|1.0|If I had the option to give this movie a 0 star rating, I wouldn't.  I would give it a single star for the battle scenes.  However, the story, character development, and, well, movie overall was a horrid waste of money and time.
B003274QH6|5.0|I've watched this series from beginning to end. Obviously this is where it begins. The only show that kept me wondering from start to finish of every episode what was going to happen next. It was completely unpredictable, and most of the time something opposite, but just as satisfying would happen. I'm glad to own this. Not to mention that watching the behind the scenes stuff is really good too.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked how it ended, how she really turned his whole life around, Can't wait for the Movies to be made.
B004SUDPXW|5.0|Another good season. I've already seen it before I had it, but it's great to own. The ending is very suspenseful.
B00D6DVSAE|4.0|I have been enjoying listening to this recording at work.  Sting is still a gifted songwriter and I love how he really paints the picture of his childhood experiences through the music.  Only four stars because I would personally have enjoyed a few more upbeat selections; many of the tracks are pretty mellow.  The songs are still great, but I do enjoy tapping my foot to the faster selections!
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Second season of this is just as great as the first. With the introduction of more characters. This season really kept me on edge.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is really cool luv the graphics and also the new robots and new paint jobs of all the robots!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I'm addicted... excellent graphics and effects, makes you think, fun, exciting... just finished the first chapter and excited to start the next!
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I am pregnant with my first child and work with children so I found this very interesting and entertaining.  The differences culturally in child rearing as well as the universal similarities in child develpment was captivating.  Anyone that loves babies and children will enjoy it :)
B006JD48NM|5.0|I bought the movie for my husband and he really enjoyed it. It was worth the price I paid.<br />Thanks for the entertainment.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I am recovering from \\"The Book Thief\\"...one of the most \\"haunting\\" books ever written (in my opinion).  If you never read another book you must read \\"The Book Thief\\".  Although the writing style took some getting used to, I found it fascinating and the authors story telling prowess truly inspiring.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just as much fun on the Kindle as on face book, I definitely would recommend it for all ages to play.
B00E9P959O|5.0|This remix was well worth the wait. Every song finally gets its due. If you liked the remixes of &#34;One Little Victory&#34; and &#34;Earthshine&#34; in the Rush Retrospective set, you will love this!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Total Blast!!! This game is great fun, try it and you won't stop.  Challenge your friends and see who can go further
B000CNFC76|5.0|An excellent chain of golf history.  At times altered for some reason., Great characters of not too familiar faces. Excellent Movie bp
B00BAXFDLM|5.0|An engaging and well written read. The main character had a great view of the world that slowly built up the book's universe without resorting to exposition.
B009GEYX5E|2.0|I love film and instant cameras, and I appreciate imperfections and some of the special editions that come along with that... I am not someone who was disappointed these were the awesome quality that comes out of my dSLR.  I was just disappointed in how ridiculously much the pictures sucked.  Out of a pack I had maybe two that turned out moderately decent, which for the price is not acceptable.<br /><br />If you want to have fun with an instant camera splurge on a Instax 210, the cheaper film will make up for the initial price pretty quick and you'll consistently get good quality shots.
0553386697|5.0|The Whole Brain Child is full of insightful information.  I used in in my Early Childhood class and have used it to help others understand my daughter.  Easy read and very helpful.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|Hated to see it end. It was fabulous. Too bad they couldn't make another series it would be great.. Loved Jack, very sensual!!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|really enjoyed the book and often wondered what became of Danny. this was very believable with the struggles he faced in trying to turn off or deaden his mind as he matured. liked the story but found the climatic ending a little rushed. all in all, well worth reading and recommended to all who loved the shining and if u haven't, maybe this book will lead you too
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy this anywhere and anytime. Plays easily, like the extras,  the scores and auto complete. You will too,  have fun.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|additive.  just wish had more life's ...so hard to wait. the time until I can start playing again. I even play when charging my kindle because I am so hooked
B005HJU7HA|5.0|..  At last, I now can enjoy all of Sherlock Holmes work! (or most of his detective work.) Sir Doyle's writing will always be available for future generations to read.
B00G32VYDG|1.0|Hard to tell which was more poorly executed the plot or the acting. To be fair the plot was too terrible for proper execution.
B005LAIH2M|1.0|First I have to admit didn't watch the entire movie.  Couldn't do it.  The story is awful and acting is pretty much as bad.  Save your time this movie might be an OK B-movie, nothing more.  Not worth the time to watch.
B0055B7K7A|4.0|Great story and message. Enjoy with the whole family in movie night. I have watched it for my Gerontology class and it's a family favorite
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|Heard so many bad reviews on this movie.  Thought I'd keep an open mind. It's OK but not much better.  Storyline is weak.  Will Smith great acting.  But got to say his son got the job because of daddy.  Should have done some smaller roles before going to such a main stream movie.  Very predictable movie.
B00DQBWLSO|1.0|I'll admit, I'm a new John Mayer fan.  The only CD I owned before buying this was 'Battle Studies' which I LOVE.  But I know some of his other well-known hits from other albums, so I was hoping for just more great music.  This did not deliver for me.  It had a country sound to it, but not a good country sound.  There were no memorable tracks on it at all, none you'd want to sing along with.  I did not care for this and am mad I didn't take my $12 and spend it on two of his older albums instead.  I will be taking this CD to the used CD store.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|Adults and children both will love this movie.  Very funny and good story.  Voices are perfect for each character.  Animation is done wonderful.  Defiantly worth a watch.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|I never write reviews, although I really should. This book was so wonderful that I want to share it with the whole world. If you want a heart-warming novel that will put a smile on your face, this is the book for you.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I have this game on my ipod and it works great. But it wont even run on my kindle fire.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It made me cry so hard. It's the true meaning of don't judge a book by its cover. Aggie earned that award. Cuttos to Aggie.
B008RKKUZ0|4.0|Sticks fairly well to the original series. Subtle humor that makes you have to focus on the dialogue fairly closely.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been hearing about this game for some time now and couldn't for the life of me figure out why it was such a popular game then I finally looked it up and realized I had it confused with another game. So I decided to give it a try and now I am addicted to it as well and so is my daughter! This is a great strategy game for the brain. LOTS OF FUN &amp; HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Amazing cd cher never disappoints, a mix of dance and love songs great, buy it.buy it buy it buy it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Its okay but it only have 10 floor then next you need to rate first to play the next level .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Too much fun! It's  such a great challenge fot your brian. You know you should stop but just one more try. :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I really don't know why there are people crying about having to pay for stuff. You don't have to. I never wanted to be sucked into this game but started playing  in June. I'm in the 300s already. I like it because it's a challenge. It's tempting to pay for extras but more fun to just keep playing til you pass it. I actually like that you can connect to fb and get and give lives to friends. The anticipation of waiting  for live  so you can play again makes it that much more fun!
B00E66QPCG|5.0|To be honest I've only been using this strategy during October 2013. I usually like to test it out 3 months before writing a review, but so far it has been amazing. Now I've been a day trader for years and have spent thousands of dollars in courses, but this has by far WoWed me the most in recent years. I don't know how easy this book will be for beginners, but when I read it, I understood it immediately. I really mean this, a beginner might need to make some minor adjustments along the way. I just adapted some of my old rules to this Bollinger and Pivot line strategy and I was off to the races. Amazing ROI thus far.<br /><br />By the way it's the first strategy with Bollinger Bands I truly understand.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about this strategy, is the range. This is more of a personal thing. The range keeps me stuck in front of the computer until I make my trade. Hey but if it keeps on working like it been during this month, I won't consider it an issue at all.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Still my favorite book since I read it when I was a child. Good preparation for the movie. Can't wait.
B009WHD144|5.0|This is a great movie that my wife and I have watched several times.  We first watched it on iTunes and liked it so much we purchased the DVD in order to share with friends.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Great quality, no complaints, awesome flick. Exactly what I expected and showed up right on time. Will be buying from them in the future.
0802473156|5.0|In today's society with everyone going in multiple directions, this is an important read for every couple.  Regardless whether you are just dating or have been married for 30 years.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|This collection of Sherlock Holmes stories was fantastic. The amount of story you get for $0.99 is incredible. I've thought about reading this for a long time, but it wasn't until I stumbled across this affordable package that I finally did. There were some errors in the text, which has been pointed out by other reviewers, but they didn't negatively affect my enjoyment at all.
B000077VR3|5.0|Great quality, no complaints, awesome flick. Exactly what I expected and showed up right on time. Will be buying from them in the future.
0316255580|5.0|Great point of view for dog lovers. My 10-year-old son has read this book over and over.<br />This book is highly recommended.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I personally liked the by hunger games better. I liked how they ended the book. I'm excited to read the next book
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I really like it very much.only issue is sometimes it stops working.and flickers.not sure why but that's my only complaint.
B00FFHG6KQ|2.0|Granted I'm not much of a gamer but this is really hard to play...maybe I should go back to donky-kong!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Love this entire album.  Beth and Joe are a team made in heaven!<br />Chocolate Jesus is where it's at!  LOVE!!!
B00EBF303Y|4.0|I was thoroughly engrossed in this book while I read it, but must admit to disappointment at the ending.  The fact that the book had a female civilian police sergeant to play opposite the male military investigator who was the lead character seemed way too predictable.  Haven't I read that type of relationship in about a thousand books already?  I liked the investigations of the multiple murders, but didn't enjoy it when Baldacci added a \\"terrorism\\" aspect to the investigation.  Baldacci has done better.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Incredible music by Beth and Joe.  A perfect coupling of great talent!<br />Highly recommended for loves of blues, incredible singing and brilliant lyrics!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Movie was weak, but nice eye-candy on a big screen.  If I had been the producer I would have gone with cheaper talent since the characters don't receive any development anyway.
B00008973A|2.0|The music and orchestration are excellent, but basically the show consists of ONE memorable tune: The aptly-named &#34;One&#34;.<br />Aside from the choreography (which is good), this movie must have set a record for low-budget.<br />We are kept wondering when the &#34;introduction&#34; will end and the storyline will begin.<br />It may serve at least one good purpose: Any girl considering a career as a Broadway dancer should watch this show; she will be permanently dissuaded from wasting her time!<br />Michael Douglas does a fairly good job as a despicable and totally heartless producer, who seems to take pleasure in shattering dreams.<br />Prediction: You will watch this movie ONCE (if you make it thru to the end), and then give it away.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Loved the first two books in this series and re-read them several times.  I couldn't wait for Allegiant to arrive.<br /><br />I was baffled by the total change of format.  She bounced between Tris and Four alternating each chapter.  I found the characters that I already knew stagnant and the new ones under developed.  To make matters worse the way the story line disposed of people I learned to love for no apparent reason I could see took any joy of this read away from me.  I own it but I probably will not read it again.  Wish I hadn't read it the first time so I could remember the people lost to me the way they were at the end of Divergent.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I would recommend this mouse to anyone with any kind of wrist pain when working at the computer. I love how you have 5 different buttons and you can make each one do a different function to your liking or even extra options when you click two buttons at once. The buttons are very sensitive, so just a light tap of the finger is all you need. And my wrist hasn't been bothering me at all while using this mouse.
1444737112|5.0|This is a book every cat lover who is interested in the human condition should read! My outlook on daily survival was changed.
006202406X|1.0|I for one am not \\"bashing the book\\" because of what happened to the Tris character - frankly, by the end of this train wreck of a book, I could not have cared less. The writing is on the level of a first grade primer - \\"See Spot. See Spot run\\". Seriously, it was laughably juvenile. I couldn't keep track of the characters, or the \\"plot\\", such as it was; I can't even critique the plot, because I have no idea what it was. I quit trying at the halfway mark, read the last few pages, then tossed it aside forever with relief.  Just plain bad, bad, bad. A real shame, too, because I really liked Divergent and recommended it to many people.  I was so-so on book two, but hoped she would redeem the trilogy with a great wrap-up; unfortunately, that did not happen.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|would have liked to seen more of the other characters too! We have already had a movie with just one smith in it for the duration of the film, even if he is a cutie!
B00881VLCE|4.0|This game is not a bad game although after a while it gets BORING!!! if you want fun an exciting  get candy crush it isn't the top free app for nothing
B001AIY58O|5.0|Come On ! Stallone, Snipes&#60; I wish they would come together today and make another one. Oh Yeah, there would have to be one hack of a writer to make that happen. This is one of the great ones.
1250037751|2.0|Are you looking for a plot that constantly moves forward through deus ex machina with stereotypical characters that lack any depth? Well, you can find that in Mr. Penumbra's 24-hour bookstore.<br /><br />To be fair, the story gets off to a good start. It begins as the story of a man, a victim of the recession's high unemployment rate, forced to take a job he otherwise would have never considered. In this new job, he finds himself immersed in the middle of a mystery. This keeps you interested for few pages. But it soon devolves into a nonsensical tale about a motley crew of San Francisco residents stomping and sweeping their way through plot holes as they try to solve the puzzle. The answer to everything is Google. But the author must think the readers are either naive or technologically illiterate. Google is presented as an all-powerful and kindhearted company. And the technological power \\"Googlers\\" wield is unrealistic and over-the-top.<br /><br />And if you think that what the story lacks in substance is made up in style, think again. It doesn't take long to realize the author has a narrow number of literary devices in his repertoire. The story is plagued with limited and repetitive structures and vocabulary. Just try and count how many times characters \\"raise an eyebrow\\". That seems to be their default reaction to everything. I guess that's what happens when you forget to develop your characters and end up relying on descriptions of irrelevant physiological reactions to construct dialogues and paint a picture in the reader's mind.<br /><br />If you need to kill some time and you're looking for an entertaining 'beach read', you may find this book satisfying. Just be aware it doesn't offer much, if any, literary value.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Oh how I love this movie! I love the music, I love the costumes, and I love Decaprio. I actually can't count how many times I have seen it.
B005FPT51K|1.0|This product looks great on paper (or on the website), however the degree of difficulty is very high for a consumer device, especially one geared towards newborn parents, who are probably sleep deprived.<br /><br />It is labeled 'iBaby', implying that it is designed to work in the iPhone\iPad ecosystem, but it requires a Windows PC for setup?  Makes no sense from a design standpoint.<br /><br />I was in computer peripheral device support for several years and have a good understanding of IP networks, wireless access protocols, etc., and I could not get it to work.  In the end I discovered the wireless was non-functional, it would only stay connected via Ethernet cable, so I returned the unit.<br /><br />The product could be great, but the setup, documentation, and quality all need much improvement.
B00G32QIEG|5.0|Still laughing at some of the punchlines from this movie, and it has been a couple of days since ive seen it!

006202406X|2.0|I am furious.  this series blows, and thanks for an ending that makes me want to shoot myself! I am so mad I almost threw the book through a window. Really this is a YA book, do you want to traumatize every teen who reads it? I'm not traumatized just livid.....I am so very sorry I even started this series, reading the final book makes me never!!!!! want to ever!!!! see the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />****EDITED***WANT TO KNOW HOW I REALLY FEEL???? READ MY REVIEW ON GOOD READS****************
B004CMBZJC|3.0|Ok story, visuals are lacking as well as any concreat caricters or a underlying story. Not recommended for those looking for enthrawling entertainment
B00DJXSKWU|1.0|The screen flips over repeatedly during the game on my kindle fire HD. If that gets fixed it could be a good game, but right now trying to play it almost impossible.
B002UWH8P6|4.0|This is a unique take on many themes throughout the sci-fi genre with good character development some interesting plot surprises.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I could hardly put it down as i WANTED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT.  When I finished the book I wanted the story to continue with the rest of the characters.  I told family and friends what I had read.  I immersed myself in the book.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|One of favorite ever. Remind me of the old Japanese comic &#34;the stranger&#34;. &#34;In case I don't see you. Good afternoon, good evening and good night.&#34;
B00BD99JMW|1.0|*Spoilers contained*<br />I got on board the Divergent train (get it?) a bit late, but I was excited because this meant I didn't have to wait long for the last installment of the trilogy, which I pre-ordered. Though not always a fan of Tris, in the first two books, I though Veronica Roth (VR) did a good job of creating a believable dystopian society and that she raised excellent questions regarding the nature of man and what kind of solutions might exist. I recommended the series to all my fellow readers. As I got into the third book, I wondered exactly how VR could possibly wrap everything up in just one last book. The expansion that occurred could have paved the way for a much longer exploration, but I was happy to think that at least Tris and Four would get their closure (and myself by extension)- and boy did they! Now, I'm not saying there must be unrealistic happily-ever-afters in dystopian settings, and I didn't expect this given the number of characters that were killed off in the first two installments. However, I DO expect in a YOUNG ADULT trilogy that if a couple's relationship is a main thrust of the story, they will at least get some kind of \\"together forever\\" as in the Hunger Games finale.<br /><br />I was so blindsided by Tris' end that I skimmed over the final 10% of the book still thinking she would have to come back somehow! Again, not my cup of tea, but if an author wants to do a stand-alone book with a tragic end for the lovers, I'm okay with that; but, to drag out the story for three books and THEN kill the protagonist (after conveniently inserting a second POV to facilitate this narrative) is completely ridiculous! I agree with the reviewer who stated the author broke the cardinal rule of romance (though I would insert YA trilogy as a more accurate category) as well as the trust of the reader. The fact that VR managed to get a movie deal BEFORE completing a trilogy is quite the accomplishment, but I for one, now have zero desire to relive the experiences of a girl who will soon be dead. What's the point? I have a feeling most audiences will agree and I will be surprised if the other books end up on the big screen. VR has lost me as reader. I will never again trust her to provide my fictional escape where I expect an outcome that is different from real life! Additionally, I found it ludicrous that the competent, well-respected Four is basically emasculated and becomes incapable of making a sound decision for a good portion of the book. What?!?!  And he is the one who lives?? Oh yes, along with a great majority of other secondary and/or non-admirable characters about whom I don't give a damn. The trilogy has gone from being my recommendation of choice to a never-to-be-revisited waste of time that I will be sure to decry at every opportunity.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|It's a ok movie for a friday night but won't which again.. Basicallly no plot, but special effects are amazing.
193700788X|5.0|It was a good ending to the series. My only complaint is I feel there were to many loose ends being tied up to quickly in the last few chapters.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This was at least a 4 star app before the changes.  This version is unpleasant to look at and a battery hog.  I am considering removing it. I really do not want to go to the pull down menu and find it running!!!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Okay, at least Anastasia is showing herself to be more than just a sex object. There is a little vengeance going on which makes the storyline more interesting than just sex.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Highly recommend! Very thought provoking and the end.....What a great way to tie things together. I did however guess the secret very early but then realized that wasnt the plot of the book really so much as the way choices we make affect so may others. It made you question your own moral compass and challenge what you believe to be right and just.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grabbed me from the start,<br /><br />When I finally found out what Sycamore<br />Row was I was horrified.  The final disposition of the case was justified. Now on to my next Grisham.

0765357151|5.0|I read a lot of unusual books and this was a very good book. Only the first half of the book is &#34;I am Legend&#34; the remainder is supernatural short stories. They are all pretty good many of them have similar storylines to the first story in the book.<br /><br />Good price. No problems.
B001ZG4J00|5.0|we watched the documentary \\"searching for sugarman\\" and told are friends about it, they also were intrigued by the story and felt compelled to by the music. I would compare him to Bob Dylan. Watch the story of Rodriguez, it is hard to believe that he was never heard of in the U.S. but became a huge hit in the U.K. even without his knowledge! The story just keeps getting better.  His music has a lot of soul to it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I enjoy playing this hidden object game.  I do not like the fact that I can only play about 15 minutes before the game runs out of energy.  If you play it often enough you can earn more energy and hints without spending money. If you are not careful this game could end up costing a small fortune.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|Bought this for my 3 year old son so we can watch it any and everywhere. He watches atleast twice a week.
B00F91H666|1.0|Very hard to review when you make an order on the 24th. and the notice say the video expired on the 23rd.?<br />Never got to watch the movie, so I give it and Amazon: One Star because there is no Zero Star!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the best John Grisham book I've read since his early days. A fun read!! Would love more like this one.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|just a fun movie to watch and if you like mysteries and cliff hangers then you will enjoy this movie
B005HSL626|5.0|My son enjoys this more than I do. He likes hitting the bombs even though he knows you are not suppose to hit them.  He likes seeing the screen flashing.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|I read several of the lower ratings, and the most common theme seems to be 'this isn't bluegrass' or 'Alan Jackson is not a bluegrass singer'.  I will not be so high-handed as to say what is and what is not bluegrass, but after listening to this CD - and thoroughly enjoying it - I found such reviews to be pretentious, misguided, and, well...irritating.<br /><br />All bluegrass does not fit into a single mold and it does not all have to sound like Ricky Skaggs, or like Bill Monroe from the 1940's (although I love that music too).  I am hearing master musicians play acoustic guitar, fiddle, mandolin, banjo, dobro, and I am hearing some harmonious singing.  These people that say this isn't bluegrass are simply wrong and needlessly judgmental.  Regarding Alan Jackson's voice, maybe it does not have that pure high lonesome sound, but no less so than Tony Rice or Lester Flatt (as two examples), and do you want to discount their picking & singing as not bluegrass?  If you do not like Alan Jackson's singing voice, then maybe you should stay away, but I think it is pompous to say he cannot sing bluegrass just because he does not hit any soprano notes.  I believe that there are some bluegrass snobs who have a problem with a \\"country\\" singer releasing a bluegrass album, but this is every bit bluegrass as many of the traditional bluegrass bands releasing music on traditional bluegrass labels.<br /><br />I don't listen to much \\"country\\" music coming out of Nashville these days, but Alan Jackson is one performer that I do enjoy. I have always loved bluegrass and old-time country, so this CD seemed like it was worth a shot.  I am glad I took the shot, because this is terrific music.  It is a good value as well with 14 tracks and over an hour of playing time.  Enough said.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy this game so much that I play it on my cell phone, my computer and my kindle fire. My family truly enjoys the game too
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This should be required  on every high school  reading list! Getting to tune in to your own thoughts and assessing those thoughts ethically and morally.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This book was recommended by a man (I'm a woman) so I was dubious, however I loved this book.  It was absolutely delightful.  I have it on my kindle so I'm not sure how long it is but it is  fairly long.  Even putting it down and picking it up later I was still completely aware of what was happening.  Fascinating to jump back and forth from then to now throughout the book.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done it again. Taken  documented historical facts and and proven how this great nation was built on individual strength, determination and sacrifice. Commitment to hard work and investing in what you believe in in America. Hooray for distinguishing success through hard work, sacrifice and saving. Setting goals and achieving success. A tool for all ages!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book had me captured from the first page. The characters were believable and they tugged at the heart all the way through.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great price especially for a multi-tv household like mine. Now I can watch netflix in the bedroom, stream hulu in the livingroom for guests and still use my phone/tablet for whatever else I need at the moment. All for half the price of a non-mobile Apple TV!
B00BXI0IHS|3.0|While I did enjoy most of this book, I found it too long and a tad boring with the first three parts more engaging than the final one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun just wished there were more than 5 games to play at one time,  easy way to waste time............
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|I downloaded the game during a trip to Florida where I had two layovers on the way there and back, with no wi-fi.  Game operates great, and doesn't load my kindle down with junk software or apps, and I am not being solicited via email for other &#34;offers&#34;.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|This album is really amazing. Laura Mvula has an amazing soulful sound that is both soothing and excites you in the melodies. Her rich sounds and soulful ballads are a breath of deep refreshing air!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It can be very addictive, if you are not careful.  I enjoy Tetris, but now I love this game.  So if you want some challenging fun,  try Candy Crush Saga.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|I'm just sayin', another love ballad made for forever love. My husband and I did our first dance to So High. We will be dancing at the renewal to All of Me. This is a beautiful cohesive album.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Marriages today need all the help they can get and this book is a wonderful help and a  must read for success.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|so far works great, on a Mac Air. Worth the minimal cost, normally a USB 3.0 hub costs 3X as much in a retail store.
0066620996|5.0|This is a great product, put to good use and I really enjoy it. I am so happy with this purchase.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it fun it keeps you thinking and you can race against your friends the  only flaw about it is that......it makes me crave chocolate thank God Halloween is Thursday or I am going to go insane but the game is insanely awesome get it
0060516402|5.0|This is a great product, put to good use and I really enjoy it. I am so happy with this purchase.
B00E9E4EC8|3.0|I love Alan Jackson, but not a Bluegrass singer. Enjoyed it but not something I would play over and over aganin
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I bought the CD, and the digital download that came with the purchase allowed me to get the songs to my husband a lot faster.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Not sure what the difference between the paid and the free version but I enjoyed this game! Try the free version first.
B000VDUWMC|3.0|My 3 stars are due to the repetition of the argument ad nauseum.  More food = more stuff.  Repeat.  So I highly recommend the first third of the book.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|If you like Miyazaki's movies, you will like this one.<br /><br />I've been very impressed with the relationships in Miyazaki's movies as he seems to understand the difference between love and physical affection, and all of the relationships in his older movies have been about real love, not infatuation and lust like we see in about every other movie and song for the last 40 years.<br /><br />It seems Miyazaki decided to join the cultural deception a little in this movie.<br /><br />It's not a big deal, the movie is cute, but I don't think they needed to say at the end of the movie that little kids need to be kissing to show love for each other.  Then they top that off with the ending song with lyrics like &#34;maybe I might love you so hold me close&#34; and chanting &#34;Kiss and hug! Kiss and hug&#34;<br /><br />Call me old fashioned if you want, but I hope you're not surprised at the alarming number of kids at school having babies when movies are teaching them to be dating before they are even in school.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A whole lot of fun. Use your math skills and you will figure it out.  Start with the smaller puzzles and work your way up.
B00005JLEU|5.0|So much depth, so culturally rich. I've done a lot of research about this movie and still don't understand a lot of the cultural references, but it's still so interesting to watch!<br /><br />And as many of Miyasaki's shows include, the animation is top notch. No short-cutting, close attention to detail, and they include scenes that most animators would just leave out because they are too much work. This movie deserves it's high rating!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Veronica Roth saves her best for last. Allegiant was everything I was hoping it would be after a long wait in between the second and third book in the Divergent trilogy. Roth wraps up the trilogy nicely. This is a book that makes you think and reflect on the world we live in and reflect on yourself. If you haven't started reading the Divergent trilogy, start today!
1616614609|5.0|The guys that taught it to us the first time had the rules all wrong, but we thought it was fun so we bought the game ourselves.<br /><br />Turns out the game was 100% better with the correct rules!  :)<br /><br />We love the different rules for each player, and how you can customize your deck to keep each other paying attention.<br /><br />My wife plays as the runner and I play as the Corporation.  Honestly, I usually loose, but still it's a lot of fun.  The games usually only take about 40 minutes to play so it's just right for a quick game after putting the kids to bed.
B00846REIS|3.0|I don't like it as much as I liked Fifty Shades. Every author writes differently. This book was supposed to be the most recommended book after Fifty Shades of Grey. So I gave it a chance. I can't seem to get into the book. I read like one chapter and won't pick it up again for another 2 weeks.<br /><br />I heard the second book was better. So I don't know. Use your own judgement.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Of course, The Hunger Games was my favorite of the three books but I'm glad that I read all of them.  It kept my interest but I was hoping that the ending would be different than it was.  Everybody has their own opinion of how they would like a book to end but this wasn't my choice.
B00C7607BC|5.0|Great copy of the movie! I was so excited to receive it! The quality is of the film is great, but I have only watched the DVD version thus far.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My three year old likes to collect the coins. It's one of those games u spend ten minutes on once a day. Not much to do on it yet it's addicting.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|Michael Keaton is great in this flick. A fun film with a lighter look at death. Watch it now! Cheers!
031623480X|5.0|This is a compelling book that will cause you to stop and re-evaluate your eating habits and how you are ultimately impacting the here and now as well as your long-term health and longevity.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn and Mitch Rapp don't disappoint. A cracking spec ops and clandestine action thriller.  Finished it in two days and three plane rides!
B005R32L66|4.0|I have used Skype on my desktop for years. Great system. I have not had much time to use the Cell Phone version as yet but if ti works like the deshtop version it should be very good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so cool I think u should buy it u can even change the mod to others things
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Jodi Picoult never fails to draw me in with sympathetic characters in morally challenging situations that keep me thinking...then surprise me at the end. In addition to teen suicide, this one addresses other timely topics including the pressure for perfection some teenagers put on themselves or perceive from their parents.
B0041D843M|5.0|As the title says: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted...<br />The book keeps it scientific correct and even without statistical knowledge, you can follow it very easy
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not as well written as the first two in the trilogy. The book seemed rushed and the plot/characters simplified to finish the book. Huge disappointment
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|We are reading this book for our book group...I wasn't looking forward to reading about someone hiking.  But it was so much more than that.  I truly enjoyed this book from start to finish.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|An instant classic that little kids today will enjoy watching again and again for the rest of their lives, just as geezers still thrill to the original Lost in Space, Star Trek and all manner of alien imaginings on film throughout history.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is chock-full of clich&eacute; dialogue, tired stereotypes and mixed-up technology eras, but it does not take away one whit of the point, which is monsters and the heroes who pummel them into submission.  Photography, graphics and sound were a feast for the senses.  My favorite characters are always nerdy geniuses, and Pacific Rim does not disappoint by choosing the best two actors possible to play the goofy, adorable and insane scientists.<br /><br />Pacific Rim made me laugh, roll my eyes, even shed a tear or two and ultimately left me admiring in awe.  No nudity or profanity, so this is a monster show for all.
006202406X|1.0|The series was good up until the ending.  I will no longer recommend this book to anyone.  It was too devastating and too dramatic for a young adult book. It left me depressed and angry.  I wouldn't read it unless you like a tragedy.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|this movie is a classic and i loved it as a child as does my daughter now.  i just bought this one for my niece for her birthday.  i recommend the purchase and shipping was quick.
B00ENTDDGW|4.0|I want 2 player. Not just one. I think this make the app be much more entertaining since I have a kindle with a large screen
B0034JKZ86|5.0|i bought this movie for my daughter a while back and this one was purchased for my niece.  i think its a very cute movie and enjoyed watching it myself.  i recommend the purchase.  quick shipping also.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I used to read Stephen King books as fast as they were published but, his last four books were not my favorites.<br />This is Stephen King at his best!<br />Doctor Sleep kept me from sleeping until I finished it!
B00A83075M|5.0|this was purchased for my niece.  i bought the blue ray/dvd combo.  my kids LOVE this movie and will watch it over and over.  shipping was quick.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|It was great my daughter really enjoyed getting the DVD, to watch her favorite series. The price was great also. Thank you.
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|This film showed a different view of Liberace than the one I was used to. I expected to see him in the T.V. shows with the bubbles. Instead I watched him at the end of his life. Michael Douglas and Matt Damon both gave realistic and outstanding performances. Before I watched the film, I saw Liberace the way I remembered him. I didn't think anyone could play him without spoiling my own memory of him but Douglas' performance pulled me right away. He and Damon exebited the seamy side of Liberace's life gently in a way that allowed me to feel the love that was real between them.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|Sudoku crashes as soon as the puzzle is finished. That's frustrating. Also frustrating,  the cubes sometimes cover each other in the adding trainer. The are the two I've used the most. I hope that the others are less buggy. The ideas behind the challenges are fine, the execution is not well done.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|It's good expert on math  And it don't know really how to tell the difference between  3'14 and 2<br />4 ans all
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I absolutely love this series. It is, by far, the best book series ever. If you hadn't read this book yet, do read it. It's a exciting, wonderful, addicting book series and I guarantee those of you who love adventures and romance will indeed fall in love with this series.
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|I am sure she will love it since it is one of the top 15 gifts for this year's  season.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Was bittersweet. I enjoy the fact that Nicholas Sparks can write a good romance without having to go into sexual detail.  Also, enjoy he has a respect for marriage.
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|On first listen I didn't like it. On second listen I'm just not sure. I expected something else from Macca, a concept album full of deep songs. Instead, here is a collection of pop tunes. Thing is that the collection does not always work. In most cases the songs are sort of weak, in others, the production kills whatever could have been. \\"Save Us\\" (2stars) and \\"Everybody Out There\\" (2stars) are very weak concert-designed rockers, too obvious, absolutely irrelevant and forgettable. Alligator 4stars) is better, although not significant. On My Way to Work (3.5stars) is growing on me, although not melodic, has something in it. Queenie Eye (2stars) uhhh, not good, not a great song and too loud. Early Days (5stars) is excellent. I like everything, specially the cracked voice. New is ok (3.5stars). Appreciate (3.5 stars) is another good song, but nothing exceptional. Hosanna (2stars) is weak where Early Days is strong, it just hasn't anything exceptional. I Can Bet (4stars) is sort of funky, I like this one a lot although I wouldn't compare it to his best Wings songs. Looking At Her (4.5stars) is quite good, not a hit by any means, but it goes places. Road (3.5) stars is good but I feel Paul has written this before. Turned Out (3.5 stars) is just ok, sounds a bit like rehash. Get Me Out Of Here(5stars) is great, it is easy not to fail with the blues, but it's not that easy to do it well and here Macca places his actual singing voice and mood where it belongs. Hidden track \\"Scared\\" (3.5stars) has good lyrics but the melody seems not to be well defined. Paul tried not to play it safe but missed in most cases, his producers don't know what to do with him, they can't tell him if a song is not good enough, it seems that they only take the job cuz it's Macca, but bring nothing into it, save for contemporary touches and noises and gadgets. I hope his next album has HIS band in it 100%, and he takes time to write serious music, because, at least, his lyrics are way better now. Allin all it is 3.5 stars for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got this app because of the title and the ratings. These games are fun and easy to learn! Yes there are some games that arent good, but i can tell you right now, there are a few. I love this app.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Confusing to read because the stories went back and forth, etc.  However, it was a fascinating read and what one will do to protect family.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|we have greatly enjoyed the characters and the writing in this series. the zombies are a little graphic however, most people in this day and age are probably not bothered by the gore.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book was very thought provoking and gave you both sides of the argument on assisted suicide.  It was about family, love, courage and acceptance.  I can't stop thinking about this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Somebody help I need rehab that's all I have to say... love this game....  I hear the candy crush music and I'm not even playing the game...
B000QRIGLC|4.0|The language could have been cleaned up and the book would be appropriate for younger readers.  This book makes it very clear who and what are our Navy SEALS and the sacrifice thy go through to protect this great country of America.  I am pleases this story was allowed to be told in such detail.  It is a story that Americans need to read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|CSI meets Outer Limits whilst travelling the Twilight Zone. A fine company of players have had my disbelief suspended from the very beginning. Special effects are seamlessly blended. Story content has clues and surprises.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I have never seen the original series but really enjoyed this one. I do know that the character Rose Buck was in the original
B009GEEMLY|5.0|For anyone who loves the comic book heroes, this movie was awesome. Agreat blend of the Marvel superheroes rolled into one great movie!
B0058UXHHK|3.0|This was a fast paced read but a little to many farfetched situations.  It was okay, can't make up my mind whether to read the rest of the books in the series.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I have heard for a large part of my life that sugar is bad but maybe not too bad, carbs are good, no wait, they're bad.... The health information changes all the time it seems. But the Hartwigs do a fantastic job of breaking things down on the physiological level, i.e. tell you how it all works. Knowledge is power and this book will empower you to change your life, if you are willing.
0307352153|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  It has more research information than I expected.  It helped me understand my own personality and how to work with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought this game was awesome. You get to update it to a new city every month or so. Great graphics and I also like how you can change the outfits of the characters.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|The book (not the movie), &#34;The Shining&#34;, was the narrative of a struggling alcoholic writer's failure to stay sober while caretaking an old, isolated hotel, during winter, and his degeneration into homicidal madness when he picks up the drink again. All of King's books have a sly bow to the philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous, as does Dr Sleep, and then some. In Dr Sleep, Stephen King brilliantly manages a creepy story with aplomb, while, at the same time, carries the AA message in no uncertain terms, without being preacy about it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A very simple device, it was easy to set up and get running. My wife who is not particularly tech savvy was able to figure out how to stream Netflix from her phone to the TV using the Chromecast with absolutely no directions from me, which made me happy.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I wish it had 5 GHz networking since I live in an apartment with a lot of 2.4 GHz wireless networks, but I have not had any issues with streaming performance over 2.4 GHz yet. I've had it for about a month now and it has been working great. Sometimes takes a while to start playing, but once it starts I have never had it buffer or stutter on playback.<br /><br />For the low price I am very pleased. Stop thinking about it and just buy one.
B000P0J0G0|2.0|I have to confess that Eng. (esp. the British one) is not my first lingual. If you are native British, you may think different. The second thing I have to confess is I was 3-4 years old when A Bit of Fry and Laurie was first broadcast. That the sitcom was a sketch comedy depicting the hilarious stuff in first to mid 80s Britain is, I finally find, a bit out of context of my understanding. There are many conversations, which I know it is supposed to make me laugh like crazy, sadly I cannot laugh as planned.<br /><br />Unlike Blackadder, which was making fun of history, A Bit of Fry and Laurie was about contemporary, which makes it frozen at a particular time and space frame, and we may have to let it stay there.<br /><br />But their act and responses were good!!!!! which I can by no means find in actors of our time, in 21 century.
0321399536|5.0|I was first introduced to Longman Cultural editions in college, and now, as a postgrad, I can only read classics in good conscious, if I am reading a Longman. The content is so rich and depending on your energy-level, provides a \\"manageable\\" or \\"extensive\\" context to frame the work. How can one really \\"read\\" a piece of the canon, without knowledge of the historical and cultural climate of the author's environment? Oh right! He or she really can't.  What I really like about these editions is that very little previous knowledge is assumed; instead, you are guided by a Virgil, in this case, Susan Wolfson, through a story that, at first, might seem too dense or too dated to be interesting: ie. \\"hell.\\" But, Frankenstein with a Longman guide is far from a trip through the underworld--although the creature's descriptions of loneliness would make for a fitting version of hell on earth. Overall, I found this to be my favorite version of Frankenstein by a mile. It was my third time through the book (two previous reads, both with Norton editions). The added bonus of footnotes that are interesting rather than irritating, along with essays that cast a light on the creation and time of the writing, made the story come to life with the brilliance of a bolt of lightening. 5 stars!
B005LQ6UE8|4.0|Claimed as a non fiction work, significant doubts have been raised as to its plausibility.  Whether fact or fiction, it is a great yarn.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|It's a good movie. I think they caught a lot of the key details from the book in order to do a good enough job, but like most books-turned-movies, it misses a lot of what really draws you into the Hunger Games story. I think the thing that really made the books so enjoyable was all of Katniss' inner-monologue. They cut out all of that in the movie to save time. We don't get to really feel her desperation and struggle as much in the films and that took a lot out of it for me personally. Unfortunately, I imagine the 2nd and 3rd will be similar.<br /><br />I have to give it a good rating though because evaluating it seperate from the book, it really is a good movie.<br /><br />If you've never read the books and have no intention of doing so, I recommend it for sure. It's a solid movie with good action, susprense, and drama.<br /><br />If you've read the book and want to see how the movie compares? Meeeeehhhh....might want to steer clear. That's a personal decision though. :)
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|By now we all know the drill about this app. This particular version still has a few kinks to solve. Especially those pesty hurricanes. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say this game is rigged so you lose. Every time I have a good move the hurricane just so happens to land in that specific spot...every single time! I don't know about you, but coincidences only go so far. The striped candy have been acting up in the mobile version. Sometimes if there is a hurricane in that row it won't do anything at all or clear the line.<br />Other than that you have your classic and addicting Candy Crush, a game I haven't managed to put down even after several empty threats after weeks of being stuck and one level.<br />Work on those glitches, people!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the many story lines going on simultaneously in this series. Each episode ended in a way that I could hardly wait for the next one. There are many good characters in the story to love and a few bad ones to hate. I don't know how authentically the British aristocracy is portrayed, but it is pretty fascinating to me as a late 20th century American. I do admit to occasionally having some trouble understanding some of the dialog, but the more I watch the more I get accustomed to it. The series is beautifully filmed in HD and the acting is superb. In all, a great series!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this app. I am famous for getting bored quickly and this has held my attention for weeks and I'm still very interested.<br />It's very easy to learn a new language with this app, and I have tried so many others I had pretty much given up. What I like the most is the fact that there are no ads or stupid things to buy or upgrade. You do have lives, but they are there more as an incentive than anything else. If you lose all your &#34;hearts&#34; or lives, you can still keep going. No begging friends for lives! How rare is that now a days!<br />Good job, Duolingo!
B004132HZS|5.0|Too much nudity - unnecessary. NOT FOR  KIDS. Sherlock talks too fast. EXCELLENT modernization of the classics. If Sherlock were living today, this is how his cases would play out. DVD works well and delivery on time.
0739337270|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book the first time I read it. I thought how great it would be for my sophomore World Literature class. And then, surprize! it was on the list for the new Common Core Standards! We got enough copies for a class set and my students LOVED it. Death as a narrator is intriguing for them and they really were able to relate to Liesel, the main character.<br />I would recommend this book to any teacher. There are not a ton of lesson plans out there for it, but sometimes you just have to read and discuss good literature, so that's what we did.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I wanted something to play that I didn't need to think about and this fit the bill. Not a fan of all the pop up ads.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|I think this was a great purchase, I like the price, I would recommend this product to everyone who likes this.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|Like so many things in this day and age<br />They act like it is free, but once they start to get you hooked you pay pay pay
B00COCY67A|5.0|I think this was a great purchase, I like the price, I would recommend this product to everyone who likes this.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I read this entire series in book form, and when I watched one episode after reading, I was very disappointed. I had in my head my own vision of what everyone looked like. However, I waited a few years and came back to watch True Blood, and I had forgotten what MY characters looked like. Thus, I enjoyed watching the entire season and went on to purchase Season 2 also. I will be purchasing Season 3 next. I am used to the characters, and I like watching episode after episode, one right after the other! (Of course, I don't get any house work completed, but eventually I will!)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun and I like that there is different places where minions can run they are really funny
B0000E6I1J|4.0|Greta for listening in the car and cuzin to Hana and thinking of George and what he left for the world. Bummer they left off &#34;Lead Horse to Water&#34;  BS there was not enough space on Disc, it was $$$.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It is so addicting. Once you pick it up, you will never want to put it down.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This DVD reeks with the love felt for a very human man with all his heartfelt lyrics. Excellent performances by all. The closing of &#34;see you in my dreams&#34; puts it all in perspective.
B00FN811SY|5.0|God's word in an application like this is the easiest way to fullfill ones spiritual needs. Easy, fast, convenient, Truly magnificent!!
B00F91SCXC|1.0|What a waste of my time. Couldn't finish watching it, it's so bad. Can't believe Brad Pitt signed on for this turkey . The producers should have left this one in the can.
B000IY06CK|5.0|It is a excellent sacd, supreme sonics and closed to perfection! You into the concert hall! The violin is alive....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game by yourself or playing against friends. Levels are challenging. Only wish you could store extra lives that friends send to you.
B00915G6SU|5.0|Ca,nt wait for season 9 to come out Thank you,this show is one of my favourites ,and buying it from you was cheaper then buying in store or walmart
B002DQLGHU|4.0|I just started reading this series with my 9 year old daughter.  Since she is now old enough to enjoy the series without being afraid, we will do our best to read them straight through this school year.  We both are enjoying the 1st book and hate to put it down.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Good app, but a little confusing to set up. If you use different time, you have to disable 24-hour time. To do this, go to your Kindle Option Menu (in the home bar) and tap settings. This is done in the app. UN-check the 24-hour time. Good app, though.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun but need more lives without having to pay or connect to Facebook.  I like all of the challenging levels, and the story is cute.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have LEDs that haven´t connection to Intenet, but now with my Chromecast I can surf by Internet, use Youtube and Netflix. I´m very happy with this buy. The buy and delivery was very simply. Thanks!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Very  fun. It  is awesome. you will like it. Most fun I have ever had. It has amazing graphics. Five stars definitely
B005R8DNDG|5.0|Very good story, historical fiction in France's early 19th century, love, adventure. I loved it and would strongly advise it !
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Just like everyone else reviewing this TV show, I agree that it is amazing storytelling. The characters are compelling and believable, the story lines are gripping and jaw dropping. It is easy to get sucked into the story and really FEEL for the characters, especially Walt.<br /><br />Doesn't hesitate to buy each season..unless you are waiting for the boxed set.
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|I think this was Amy's finest collection - before the fame, drugs and alcohol messed her up. It's a shame that such a great talent was wasted and her life so short.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|good<br /> i like it you need it, it makes tap more easier ,it is free ,faster and it looks nice
B005PK56TA|5.0|I kept hearing friends talk about it so I decided to finally check it out and I'm glad I did. I  love it!!!  It's just the right amount of suspense and anticipation.  Can't wait to watch the next season!
B007PVHMCG|3.0|...and of course we all know that Lego toys are way overpriced for what you get.  A box of pieces that make a mess.  I do not know why we purchase Lego junk!!!  The very little Lego can do is give you a plastic covered box to keep the pieces in...come on $50 to this???
006202406X|4.0|I know people are unhappy about the ending. And I know people are unhappy with the split narration.<br /><br />But it's not about what the reader wants. It's about what the author knows. She created these characters and this world.<br /><br />Did I love it as much as I loved the first two? No. But it resolves it the way she wanted to resolve it, and I accept that. I was disappointed I didn't have time to sit and read it all in one sitting.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was discouraged when I first started reading this book because of all the harsh comments. Yet, I was really enjoying it! I thought this book was well written and kept me reading. Quite frankly it was everything I had hoped and more. This book was a very good farewell to the series, though I am sad to see it go. I strongly encourage Divergent fans to read this last novel. I will remain a strong Veronica Roth fan. I know I will be attending The Divergent movie and I hope others will too.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|I absolutely love this concert - some of the best live concert footage ever. I am sooooooo glad that Kamelot made this DVD before Khan left. His will always be for me the best front man/lead singer of any metal or rock band. His stage presence was amazing. Kamelot is still a great band when Khan retired it was a great loss for the music world!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have been a big fan of Kings books.. however I have felt let down in his past books.  Loved the earlier books so scary.  Dr Sleep is a great story.  King is back.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|We are now 1.5- 2 years and millions of dead people into this event and  the characters have learned nothing (notice how they still point there guns at each other, like they know they are props) CARS ARE NOT RUNNING ANYMORE!! My real issue is that they are not moving around like they did in season one, thank you.
B00G32OER4|5.0|My wife and I love watching horror movies, and this one was great! Probably not the scariest we've seen, but plenty of jumps. The plot is not terribly difficult to predict, but it still remains interesting. Not a gory movie, just good frights.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This book was nothing I thought it would be.  The interview-like narrative was confusing and led to a disjointed, sometimes downright boring story.
1250030951|2.0|Full disclosure: DNF at pg 133 (30%)<br /><br />It's not you, it's me.<br /><br />Meh. That pretty much sums up my overall feeling about this book. I'm just bored.<br /><br />The writing is good, the characters are developed, the external plot is non-existent and I forced myself to read each and every one of those pages.<br /><br />In truth the book is all about Cath's journey - While Cath is much more extreme than I ever was, I understood her. She's very introverted to the point where social interaction literally gives her anxiety and she chooses to be almost a hermit to avoid it; she prefers living and interacting in a fictional world to the real one, and she's incredibly giving to those she loves - even if they don't always appreciate it.<br /><br />But nothing happens. At all. Cath goes from one encounter to the next, and I felt like I was told more about each one than shown anything. Additionally, I didn't love the fanfic portions that were written - I found myself skimming them and they took me out of the story every single time. And with Simon Snow obviously being a stand-in for Harry Potter, I'm not sure about the weird and random HP reference in the book. It doesn't make logical sense how there can be both of them in this world, and I figured where Simon Snow existed Harry Potter wouldn't - so that kind of threw me too.<br /><br />I wanted to love this, I really did.
1593275080|5.0|I liked it so much, I ordered another as a gift.  It may count that my son's work is featured in the book!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. I would recommend this to other people. However, I would make a better tutorial for when you start.
B00E9ZFIMM|4.0|Notepad Pro allows you to put your thoughts down when location, pen and paper are unavailable. While giving you easy access when you do find the time..
0061950726|5.0|Beautifully written, sad but most likely based on fact.  The only thing I could not buy is when the woman gave her baby away.  I would think that someone with such holes in her heart, would welcome the huge space in that heart that a baby would provide.
0156421178|4.0|Shortly after General Franco decided to overthrow the legitimate Spanish government, Orwell decided to travel to Spain to get some inspiration and new ideas to write articles about. However, not long after arriving, he joined the Republican militias to fight against the Fascists for the noble cause of saving Democracy in Spain.<br /><br />As Orwell himself admits this work is not supposed to be a complete point of view on the Spanish Civil War. But rather it presents a counter-attack against the Soviet propaganda against POUM and against every organization that was aligned with the Soviet regime.  Strangely enough, not a lot is being said about the Fascists. Orwell primarily focuses on the inner struggles between the various organizations on the Republican side.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part for me was Orwell's firsthand account (the Spanish Civil War version of \\"Goodbye to All That\\") of the daily routine and the actual fighting.  Orwell doesn't try to portray the fighting as glamorous. As a matter of fact, it was a complete bore for most of the time. I think Orwell's honest account of the fighting is brave and revealing, especially when considering that he doesn't try to paint himself as a heroic figure, although many will argue that joining a foreign army to fight Fascism and save Democracy in Spain is not a trivial matter, but an heroic pursuit.
B009V0TV6O|5.0|Versatile (more than tick-tock, tick-tock), Rhythmic way to keep count of your music. Also makes a great focus tool for relaxation/meditation.
B0044BIZXU|1.0|Do not be fooled by the great price I could not play these movies due to having the wrong region code.
B0038AUYJ6|4.0|I do not wish to review books and will switch to ibooks if amazon forces me to do so now
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I found the subject matter intriguing--who hasn't wondered about life behind bars? The author admits her guilt in a drug trafficking charge, although she has long since forsaken the activity.  Even with the advantages of financial backing, family support, and a very high profile lawyer, Piper Kerman is sentenced to 15 months in Danbury low security federal prison. Piper recounts her prison experience in all its gruesome, sometimes pathetically funny, often touching detail.  But the account became increasingly irritating as the author's whiney tone became more pervasive.  While at the Danbury, the author was not incarcerated in a cell behind bars. Prison roommates occupy \\"cubicles\\" in dorms, have birthday parties, going away parties, do each other's hair and nails, watch television and movies, and have opportunities to learn skills and move around the campus through participation in prison jobs. Piper works out her time in ways that build her mental and physical capabilities and she develops authentic relationships with other prisoners. At the same time, she chafes at the restrictions and regulations now forced upon her, viewing them as both unnecessary and unwarranted.  For example, she rails bitterly when her supervisor won't break the rules and allow her to visit her grandmother or attend her funeral when her death occurs during the author's incarceration.  Hello??  Is your prison sentence inconveniencing you? (Note: minimum security inmates are allowed leave for parents' or children's deaths, and sometimes siblings as well). On the other hand, the author puts her insider's view to good use in exposing the inequities and abuses that appear to abound in the nation's prison system.  She also offers an extensive list of resources on her website to help correct the detrimental practices and effects of the current U.S. prison system.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|what a series. wish i had it in bluray. i am watching it now. i can't get enough of it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book is intriguing and relatable with a lot of details. I was just kinda disappointed it didn't love up to all the hype people talked it up to be.  For being a &#34;dirty&#34; book, it wasn't all that dirty to begin with but overall a pretty good book.  Good enough to keep someone like me to keep reading, and that's that I always disliked reading... Totally recommendable on my end, but probably more along the line as for female readers though.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Well, this is the latest album from Madonna and it sounds really good. With an incredible introduction, I know from the beginning that this is going to be an excellent album.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|can't wait for season 4. The sets, costumes, script, acting are all top notch. why aren't US productions this good?
6305428042|5.0|This movie is funny, what more is there to say.  I love all the witches and story just keeps on rolling.  Especially like &#34;McKee/NCIS&#34; in the role of the cat, Binks.  I watch this movie year round for a good laugh...8-9 year olds will love this movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A beautiful puzzle mystery that has amazing sensory input.  It offers a decent challenge and an intriguing storyline.  I am thoroughly enjoying it!  The only issue I've had is the long loading time. The Icon displayed during loading should pulse or rotate to indicate that it's working and not locked up.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great little game! Can drive you crazy.especially when it takes sometimes multiple tries to break through a level...but it is fun and addictive and makes you strategize!!
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These meet so many of my kitchen needs - able to be used with non-stick or regular pots and pans, durable and effective to use, easy to store and find what you need quickly due to colored handles, and I LOVE the ridge that allows the utensils to be set aside without touching the counter/stovetop.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|Loved the first two Hangover movies. Must be this one the viewers were supposed to be messed up on drugs. Don't watch it if you liked the others becuase this one isn't even in the same ballpark.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|This series is the most enjoyable series and thanks to Amazon to bring the chance to view it once again. The video quality is very good to watch.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|I bought these for a night ride we did.  My daughter loved them.  I plan to leave them on my bike for the winter since I ride to work a lot and I think they will help with visibility.  Besides they are just super cool.<br /><br />What I liked about the product is that is seems that the whole circuit board was dipped in some sort of protective plastic coating.<br /><br />I just hope they aren't stolen of my bike.  It would be nice if there was some way to easily remove from your bike or to lock it more permanently to your bike than zip ties.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The book was well written and the plot kept moving. I liked how the historical perspective was written onto the plot.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|very good. I am going to use this space to post my concerns about book spammers.  I'd like to see Amazon adopt a zero tolerance policy just like Smashwords.  thanks.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|Marketed as a country album, I've been a Sheryl Crow fan since &#34;Tuesday Night&#34;. I enjoyed &#34;Easy&#34; and yet the other songs stand out. A good feel and also good to ear witness her music growth.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book was disappointing for me because I never actually connected with the plot, and after the ending of Insurgent I wanted more. It just felt like watching all those conspiracy movies again, a big cover up. Tris was once again responsible for a revolution, big news right, but I didn’t like her POV, it felt strained to me, just like her relationship with Tobias, it felt like a lie and the only thing they could do together was make up.<br /><br />Tobias was a big zero on this story, because as always he doesn’t trust Tris, with the true and with doing the right thing. He always wants to have the last word and be right because mostly he wants to show in his parents face that he can do it. So he did mistakes, lots of those and in the end he sound like a winning baby, crying over nothing.<br /><br />I was a little dubious about this book, mostly because of the dual POV and I was right, it’s wasnt perfect for me and I wish to go back and never read it. Some people may like, but there were way to many mistakes and the characters practically lost their personalities, it felt like a Tris and Tobias book, when we all know this world is more than that.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|so i just like it like it very much like i like how yooooooouuuuuuuuu have to upgrade your very cool vehicle
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I like movies that make you think AND feel!  This is a good one - not an action-packed, thriller, just a good ol' watch with the family kind of movie.  I had, however, forgotten about a couple of scenes that I had to have my 11 year old cover his eyes for.  ;-)
B00FI7XBIS|4.0|Nice little puzzle game with cute graphics. Killing the princesses would not have been necessary and cost a star. The V could have just enjoyed a meal and let go...
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Cann't down load it from Google to my Samsung. Keeps flashing past the username and password. Guess I will need to go to ATT.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|This book was great! It was entertaining, honest and witty. I would read another book by Tina Fey if she write one
159562015X|5.0|It's important to understand the basic skills and interests that a new team member brings to a team. We map each team member on a spreadsheet and then gain a basic understanding of the team skill sets. Our goal is to develop well balanced teams and StrengthsFinder is a great way to do it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed THE SHINING will love finding out what happens to little Danny &#34;Doc&#34; Torrance.  As usual Mr. King gives us well crafted  characters in a wonderful story that has enough surprises and action to keep you wanting more.  Even if you didn't read THE SHINING you will enjoy DR. SLEEP, but why not read them both!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and so decided to read the book.<br />Even though I knew the story from the movie the book just added so much more.<br />It was great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is one of many apps I have been waiting for the Amazon store to get.  I hate that I can't use google apps on my kindle. Hopefully, there will be more cool apps coming to Amazon store.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE this game, and I am so excited that it is now available for Kindle! It is the perfect game for the busy person who needs a distraction every once in a while. Entertaining, fun, and easy to learn and use. Thank you Amazon!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A must read! Every American should read this. The most amazing book I've ever read. This was a awesome story that must be heard.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|So any MJ fan would love it! This was a present for my wife on her birthday and she is an MJ fanatic. She was missing this one and one other from her CD collection. Very fast delivery and arrived in perfect condition!
B005544V6A|4.0|Not your usual lawyer show. It's fun, takes a different twist. Very entertaining. I enjoy seeing someone who has the skill but not the education get a chance.

B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|I don't care what reviewers say, this was everything I expect from Bridget (humour, mistakes, romance) with maybe even a bit more soul :) LOVED it! Will definitely read again!
B00F91H666|1.0|Well, the tall wall will not save you (should look at massive fences around Hollywood stars' mansions), but Brad Pitt will.
006202406X|1.0|To Ms. Veronica Ross: \\"I was rooting for you... we were all rooting for you...HOW DARE YOU!!!\\"<br /><br />Now a moment of silence for all who join me in picking up the pieces from, what can only be described as, an emotionally-exhausting and mentally infuriating finale.<br /><br />Perhaps like many of you, I now sit under a blanket mourning the loss of 56 hours of reading, 2 months of waiting, 5 (now, embarrassingly-confident) recommendations, and a story which held the potential to be the best series I've ever read.If you'd have told me a few days ago that Ms. Roth would have blew the whole series in one long-winded, entirely repetitive book I wouldn't have believed it... but here we are.<br /><br />I'll be perfectly honest- for a majority of the series, it was the spicy romance and sexual tension that kept me eagerly flipping the pages. In Divergent and Insurgent, Tobias was strong, sexy, mysterious.  But as soon as I began to read the first pages of chapter 4 (and effectively realized after a few rereadings) that it was written from Tobias' POV... (to quote a Ms. Roth over-used line) - I tasted bile.  I did not want to be inside Tobias's head.  For me, nearly instantly, this revolutionary-poised, swoonworthy lead man turned into a whiny, jealous mama's boy.  For me Ms. Roth killed off the alluring, wonderful Tobias Eaton before the story really even started.<br /><br />For the rest of story, up until the ridiculous ending, nothing all that revolutionary happened.<br /><br />As for killing off Tris, it was a pathetic attempt at shock-value.  It wasn't all that shocking after all the foreshadowing, and it DIDN'T ADD ANY VALUE to the story.  So the city got to keep their precious little memories, but every character Roth made me care about up until then ended up worse off for the whole trauma: Christina lost her only two friends, Caleb lost his chance at redemption, and Tobias obviously lost everything (including his damn mind) except for his off-and-on-again, crazymother.<br /><br />This story was unsettling, and not in a good way.  It felt like a confusing break up where, just a few days ago, you had so much love and hope, and today all you are left with is a (boring and repetitive) dear john note.<br /><br />This will be the last Roth book I will ever read.  Fool me once....
0385743564|5.0|If you are looking for a quick read this is the book.  Brandon Sanderson is very well known for his detail and depth in his stories and somehow he accomplishes it in a smaller than normal book.  I thought from the beginning I knew how this was going to end but I was very wrong.  I do not consider myself a fantasy or sci-fi fan but I am a Brandon Sanderson fan and I am looking forward to the next installment along with all his other works.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it but I lost interest in chapter 2 and then I did it like it so that is it
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Not only is the acting above the norm, it's actually underacted for a change, and the personalities of the main characters thoroughly believable, but this story grabs from the first shots.  Incredible photography of surfers as a background to the main story doesn't overpower your interest in this relationship between a younger, compassionate surfer dude, and a slightly more mature one. It's a movie you'll want to watch over and over as you are enfolded in the struggles many young gays have aligning their needs with family obligations, but still wanting to break away. Cliches are absent, which is refreshing and the intimate scenes are just that, intimate, and tasteful; this is not a sex film. Buy it and watch often.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game! So happy it is finally on the Kindle! Now I can play it all the time! :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally!  i have waited for a long time and finally candy crush is available for the kindle!  everything seems to be grat and i love the fact that i can play while not having internet access and it will update.my facebook progress when i do have a connection!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad Candy Crush Saga has finally came to Kindle Fire. If you like puzzle games, this one is great.
B00G24KKAS|5.0|2 bucks can't beat that better then my old 100 cable bill. Ricks a farmer haha yeh rite. Soo are the pigs gonna be Zombies too? Zombie pig and zombie corn? I don't like the relationship bs too many love storys going on, its funny how quickly all these new characters die, you can tell who's gonna die

B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|It is the best get It now don't waste your time just get it. The LeBron James mode is awesome.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I loved this book!  It's a quick read, although it gets pretty deep sometimes, but the principles are easy to understand, and they will change your perspective. Highly recommended.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app doesn't let me download it. And I think this app is berg stupid but if it was fixed than I would get it
B0084ANCBC|1.0|It was not my favorite book, for it was very, very, very boring and uninteresting to me but maybe not for other people.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It kept me reading it all day. I think I liked it better than the new movie Oz The Great and Powerful. Overall it was a good book.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Can't put it down and my son loves it!!I thought that it might be cheesy like a lot of others but actually impressed!!
B000002VMD|3.0|Sure, I like the first six songs on the Soundtrack.  Whitney's voice, phrasing, emotional content is incomparable.  That said, especially when looking back from 2013 (the date of this review), I hear all the studio gimmickry, including false echo on her voice, the relentless use of cheesy synths, and the whole saccharine over-orchestrated approach to each song.  Gosh, I wish I could hear Whitney unaltered in an acoustic setting.  I also can't say much about the last six songs -- they don't add much to the experience.
B000UUF69A|4.0|My children love the TMNT story and though the movie is slightly dated the characters are quite enjoyable. The story is engaging and was enjoyed by all.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book kinda ruined my life. You're better off ending with insurgent..... I wish I didn't read this fricking book.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|There's something very refreshing and inspirational about a young artist with a very broad knowledge of old music and music history in general. It's a testament to the singer's eclectic taste, creative ambitions and great passion for his or hers chosen profession - a depth and driving force beyond mere chart positions and lucrative commerciality. Maxwell and Alicia Keys belong in this category. And so does Janelle Mon&aacute;e (as indicated by the gorgeous late `70s/early `80s retro album cover). In the charming liner notes to the 27-year-old singer's second album, The Electric Lady, she lists the artists that inspired each song - and listening to these songs even more influences are revealed by way of various little details and musical ideas.<br /><br />Regardless of all of Mon&aacute;e's many artistic influences, she's very much a unique, skillful and intelligent artist in her own right, and The Electric Lady is an ambitious, accomplished work of art, the most gratifying R&B-flavored album since Alicia Keys' The Diary Of Alicia Keys.<br /><br />volt-and-volume.com
B00BY9GQHM|3.0|The plot is interesting, but a little darker than I had anticipated. I chose this particular game because it made no references to ghosts, zombies,mummies, and other such creatures. So far, none have appeared to possess my Kindle. But I'm not  finished with the game yet.I'd recommend this to friends but add the following cautions.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are so dark, even with the brightness adjusted to the highest setting that it was impossible for me to distinguish some of the items.<br /><br />When I accidentally tapped on these a couple of times they disappeared so quickly that I wasn't able to see them or where they had been hidden.<br />Some of the items are so low in the picture that you can't see them because the list covers them.<br /><br />Other than these minor flaws it really is a pretty good game!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like that kind of game. I have gotten to a level that is different and the directions don't tell enough about what my objective is. Enjoy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just got this app on my kindle fire hd and love it! Highly recommend. I've had no problems with it and find the game slightly addicting.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Haven't finished it yet, but I like it... It's pretty graphic with the sex scenes. Because of this I don't think it's very appropriate for kids, but I don't have them so I'm not to worried about it :)
B00ERP55NQ|5.0|great to have this on kindle too --very easy to use just as the same on<br />the big pc  clear view
B00127RAJY|5.0|Some days I have more time than others and it's nice to have a quick 20-minute workout. Like how you can break it up and switch it up.<br />DVD arrived quicker than anticipated. No problems to report.
B00F91G5BS|5.0|I didn't have great expectations as I didn't hear great things about the movie from anyone. However I enjoyed every bit, even though it was creepy.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|The Circle is a great read!  It kept me engaged from the start.  You will not be disappointed and I would highly recommend the novel
0140557741|5.0|I use this &#34;book&#34; as a communication activity during my teambuilding events. I cut the book up into individual pages, laminated each page, and then hand out all of the pages in random order to a group of 10 to 20 participants. Then the group must silently move around and put the book back in order, from page 1 to the end, without putting the pages down on the ground or on a table. This non-verbal communication game forces participants to go through all of the steps in coordinating a project as a team, without the distraction of speaking to one another. Awesome!
B008Y1NY14|1.0|The kindle book is free so I can't complain too much. However, the book does not show any code. It's free so many people I am sure will be tempted to download it (I sadly did), but if you do know that even if you work minimum wage, your time is more valuable than this book.

B005544TRQ|3.0|While the premise, twisty plots, and pretty faces make this show addictive, the writers are guilty of unrealistic and inconsistent characters who often seem like little more than vehicles for bending the plot to a preconceived end.  There's also some pretty egregious &#34;Molly Sueing&#34; especially in the case of the sanctimonious Harvey Specter. Is anyone really buying this moral crusader's effortless climb to the top of Manhattan's most prestigious law firm?<br /><br />Still the show has a certain charm and even with some copious eye rolling I watched my way through the 3rd season.

B007R21JJK|4.0|performance is really good. It is pushing an i5 3570K cpu with a HD 7870 gpu. Stable and smooth.<br />The bios interface is interesting though. Simple with detailed settings for overclocking. I haven't started over clocking yet, so can't give any comments on it.<br />Board doesn't get super hot. I have a decent air cooling system in place.<br /><br />My problems though is that, even though there are 6 ports in the back there is no Creative control panel compatibility (or equivalent) (like from my previous board). so trying to configure my 5.1 speaker set up is a pain and my programs/games dont seem to work with the 5.1 here. Still researching up on how to get over this.
B00DOQK2OG|4.0|After listening, totally enjoying (and reviewing) Mr. Blackmore's last studio CD \\"Stranger in Us All,\\" with Rainbow before disappearing into the 16th century, I was really jazzed upon hearing about this live concert from the tour following the release of said album. I must divide this review into 2 parts. Disc 1 is so-so. The mixing is erratic. The drums, bass, and keyboard are virtually non-existent unless they are soloing. Which means vocalist Doogie White - who isn't that strong to begin with - comes out way too full. Blackmore's sound is excellent. Disc 2 is much better, although it becomes VERY apparent that this CD has been released to feature RB, and not the band. The entire mix and sound of the live set is.....off? Granted, I was not there, so this may be an accurate reflection of the sound that evening in Germany. But, this was simply not engineered with the skill it required. However, the highlights on disc 2 make this worth purchasing, if you get if for a good price. The group (well, Blackmore) blazes thru terrific renditions of \\"Ariel,\\" \\"Perfect Strangers,\\" \\"Hall of the Mountain King,\\" and an outstanding send-up of \\"Burn.\\" Which for me was a nice treat, because while I LOVE the seething guitar riff, I find David Coverdale's vocals a huge irritant. So this is a mixed bag. The good stuff is very good, but you may spend much of your listening with your ear tilted to one side, wondering \\"why does that sound like that?\\" Just so you know.
B00FF8OKJE|4.0|I love the game it's none stop fun but then there will be updates that will lock  you out of the game and I will go to games to see if it's there but it won't be then I wait for hours or days for the update to finish or show up please fix. Also you guys should add other games.

0156027321|5.0|What a ride! This such a good read that, after you finish reading, you'll feel it ended much too soon. Even the most hard core realist will quickly be swept up and charmed by this improbable tale of courage and ingenuity. This book was so well written that the journey became my own personal odyssey. What took place in my mind's eye, was such an enthralling experience that I did not want to see the movie — certain that it would be a disappointment.
B005LAIGF0|4.0|Best seen in the extended version, which still leaves unanswered questions.  Anna Paquin is completely compelling as the teenage daughter, not afraid to be unlikable.  Jeannie Berlin is a clone of her mother Elaine May and gives a brilliantly lowkey intense performance.  Alison Janney is marvelous in a brief but pivotal role.  Mark Garofalo and Matt Damon take their apparently amoral character sketches and make them alive. Jean Reno, ever the fascinating outsider, is great as always (but one of my unanswered questions:  \\"Why would he choose Riverside?\\" - you'll see).  I know I saw a work of genius, but I found myself a bit mystified and perhaps dissatisfied.
B001I8BY80|5.0|That is right this is a novel about the history of philosophy. It was written by Norwegian professor Jostein Gaarder. Gaarder Now writes other novels and has a large following. I personally found it fun to read and intriguing.<br /><br />Some readers may think the ending is a little strange however it fits the story perfectly. This novel is used as an introduction point to philosophy. So it would not be appropriate for those that already have a background in philosophy to dismiss this as sophomoric. Everyone has to start somewhere. If you are already a philosopher then it is still an interesting novel with an interesting twist.<br /><br />Receiving a mysterious letter in the mail, Sophie Amundson is about to embark on a mysterious journey that is mosty correspondents and may become mutch more.

B008JFUO72|5.0|was a very good movie. would watch it again. bought it for my son that loves these types of movies.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I am bothered by the fact I am even reviewing or analyzing the film in any way.<br /><br />If I taught film I'd show this every semester and have the students rip it to shreds over and over, backdated to the begining of time.<br /><br />In the future we can't mask our smell and defeat blind aliens. This film lost me at hello. We use hand to hand combat to defeat Starship Trooper aliens? This film robbed Avatar which robbed everything. Plants would die if they froze every night? This film robbed the Batman and Robin utility belt/jumping the shark concept and took it to a new low.<br /><br />I think to even mention this film or approach it in any rational way only adds to the likelihood that someone might think is has some merit. It has zero merit and it's all rooted in the bad writing.<br /><br />This film is AWFUL. One of the worst in a long time.<br /><br />I'm not wasting too many words on this.<br /><br />After Earth with Will Smith and his son was one of the most awful films I've seen in a long time. The idea of a science fiction film with a father and son stranded on a hostile world is a great idea. It's gold in 2013, especially with the current level of filmmaking sophistication and special effects at any writers & directors disposal. You'd have to be 4 years old to mess up such a simply great idea and even then a 4 year old would likely do much better.<br /><br />Somehow M Night Shyamalan managed to implode this up beyond all wildest imagination. It was so bad I'm almost considering the possibility that he might just be intentionally thumbing his nose at Hollywood in some ironic way. I can't imagine any other reason this film could be cobbled together so poorly and with such little regard for logic, common sense, and science.<br /><br />All the film needed to do was have the two wake up on the hostile world and survive danger. If they wanted the plot point of the military father who finally comes to appreciate his son as a person, not a cadet, they could have added that in too. Just staying alive till help arrived could have been enough. And steer clear of Avatar type scenarios so you are not being redundant within recent film history. Almost any 2 people 2-3 days locked in a hotel room would have yielded a decent story. Any hack screenwriter could have then produced something of minor merit.<br /><br />This film is so far from mediocre and buried beneath 40 miles of waste that it is incredible it even exists.<br /><br />Then they add these insane plot points like a super futuristic ship crashes and only has 2 distress beacons that don't auto fire. No signal is sent out before, or during the crash?<br /><br />This film plays out like an old episode of batman where they have exactly what they need in their medical-pack.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Fascinating and well-plotted. I tend to be afraid to try low-cost books, but this was a great series. I'm glad I got the bundle, though, because the cliff hanger endings would have been really tense.

055358894X|5.0|The simplest pitch for The Lies of Locke Lamora would be Thieves World Venice. Fantasy often borrows heavily from history, and LLL is no exception. I'd place the  era as roughly 17th century. The book is set entirely in the fictional city of Camorr. It's got canals, bridges, Italian names, a Duke (Doge), nobles, masks, and pretty much all the trappings of the real Venince. It's also got sorcerers, alchemy, and giant towers built of indestructible Elderglass.<br /><br />Like the brilliant Perdido Street Station, LLL features the city as character. This outing isn't quite as purely imaginative, but also isn't nearly as weird, and  far more approachable. I'm a big Venice fan anyway, and so I very much enjoyed the feel. There is a nice balance struck here between atmosphere and pacing. LLL is a fast book with a lot of flavor. The underworld and the city proper are both excellently realized. I particularly enjoyed the glimpses into a  well developed religion. Camorr is a city of 13 gods, and as such borrows more religious spirit from antiquity, but at the same time Lynch colors it with an extremely Renaissance/Baroque feel.<br /><br />The novel is fairly focused. No Game of Thrones, LLL concentrates on a single hero and a few of his friends. It's written in a slightly bizarre third person omniscient, without a heavy distinct narrator, but feels free to flit around between time and characters (even if it hovers 90% on our protagonist, Locke). Interludes discussing historical aspects of the city or flashing back to (mostly) relevant childhood events in the lives of our heroes are frequent. While these stray from the spine of the story, they are entertaining and add depth. There is some slight of hand played with the chronology. Occasionally some action is undercut with the preparations for the same action in a way which is a little confusing.<br /><br />At the prose level, Lynch is a good writer, with some style and flair. He does a nice job dotting the text with certain archaic words that lend flavor, but all the while keeping the text modern and lively. And he has a knack for deft and humorous descriptions. At the same time, there is a hint of anachronism. LLL isn't a Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell with pitch perfect historical tone -- but it is also much faster paced and transparent to the reader.<br /><br />The action of LLL is part heist, part swashbuckling adventure, part orphan tale. Like a Venitian Ocean's Eleven, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Oliver Twist all rolled into one. The tone is quippy and cavalier, but also contains a dose of nastiness and torture (night that I mind). The dialog is full of zingers -- many hit, some miss. And often it sounds oddly modern. The plot is easy enough to follow but has a certain byzantine quality -- and more than its share of deus ex machina -- but essentially it all works. The action is fast, furious, and easy to follow. A dizzying mix, but one that works well.<br /><br />I pounded through the second half (at 752 pages, hardly a novella) in one sitting. Flaws aside, it's fun and ambitious without being overwrought in scope. All in all, The Lies of Locke Lamora was no chore, instead a genuine pleasure, and certainly the best fantasy I've read this year!<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimedrchaic words that lend flavor, but all the while keeping the text modern and lively.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|I know there is a lot of great buzz about Gravity, but I have to chime in and agree. This is just a wonderful film. It's not deepest hour and a half of cinema to ever hit the silver screen, but as a Science Fiction film, spectacle, thriller, and all around emotional experience -- it's first rate.<br /><br />Let me also say that I've been an Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n fan for some time. I loved his version of Great Expectations. Y Tu Mam&aacute; Tambi&eacute;n is extremely touching. And Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (a bit of a deviation for him) is the most personal and thoughtful of that octolagy. Cuar&oacute;n knows how to combine intimacy with visual panache and Gravity is not only directed by him, but co-written, and produced by him as well.<br /><br />The premise here is simple. Something goes wrong in space. Sandra Bullock tries to survive. The nothingness between worlds is both beautiful and scary. This is the most hostile environment mankind has ventured to. Maybe being pressurized on a really deep dive is about as bad, but at least there, up is up and down is down.<br /><br />This is a gorgeous film. Everyone says so, and they're right. The 3D is subtle and intense. The panning and spinning shots are dizzying on purpose. I didn't even see it in Imax (just on a normal big Real 3D setup). In Imax it must be really intense. The visuals are generally seamless. The shots have a nice artistry to them, as one expects from Cuar&oacute;n.<br /><br />It's also, for all its big scope, a very intimate and personal film. Bullock carries it, and carry it she must as she's in every scene and there is only one other actor (George Clooney) -- and he's gone after the 25% mark. This is her film, and that same plucky charisma she displayed in Demolition Man, Speed, and whenever she picked a decent script over the 20 years since is there in  force. I'm not sure I totally believe her as a loner doctor, but she had me at \\"hello.\\" You feel for her, for her character, and for the awesome magnificence of the circumstances in which she finds herself. There is just enough backstory  to sell the emotional depth. When she manages to get inside the International Space Station (after nearly being punctured, battered, and suffocated), she curls into a little zero G ball. It works.<br /><br />The music is also very good, adding to the grandeur and scope . Just as effective is the consistent and utter lack of any sound that wouldn't be conveyed through vacuum. The shuttle and space station are destroyed silently. Hatches bang open without a sound. Jets release gas soundlessly. Like that moment in Saving Private Ryan where the artillery blast knocks out Tom Hank's ears, the effect is even more dramatic that the usual cacophony.<br /><br />Gravity`s pacing is relentless. As each hopeful goal is neared, some new catastrophe intervenes, keeping possible salvation just out of reach. This is accomplished with a deft mix of understandable mistakes and by the sheer array of force deployed against our heroine. But for all that, this is a movie without any villains. The one secondary character borders on saintly. It's a classic \\"man against nature\\" thriller, and the scope of nature's ability to kill here is truly frightening. When you depend a thin layer of archaic and marginal 1960s tech for every ounce of survival, things like 300 degree temperature swings and small bits of metal traveling 20,000 miles an hour are formidable foes.<br /><br />Let's sidestep for a second and talk about the Science Fiction. Gravity doesn't assume any future tech. It's set right now, or perhaps even 2011 as we haven't launched a space shuttle since then. The events are improbable, and even a few are probably unsurvivable, but the film doesn't go out of its way to be unrealistic or gratuitous. If I had to choose things to disbelieve, I can: Some of that huge debris storm would likely have hit Sandra (fatally). The sheer amount of physical punishment (being whacked around) would be pretty tough to take. Sandra manages to do a lot of things that are probably very difficult, very quickly. The 3 hours shown would be unimaginably exhausting. Her ISS Soyuz capsule was traveling pretty fast as she passed the Chinese station, and there is no friction in space, so I'm not sure the thrust in a single half-used fire hydrant would be sufficient to match velocity with the station. Or that she had the talent to fly with it. The early reentry of said station would probably be catastrophic as well. But this is all unimportant. Movies require suspension of disbelief, and this film doesn't demand such unreasonably.<br /><br />Gravity does everything a film should do. It provides character and drama. Shock and spectacle. Thrills and tears. Enough said.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dreamndra manages to do a lot of things that are probably very difficult, very quickly.

B004P1JDJO|5.0|I've read 37 books so far this year and this is my favorite. Drive is full of solid research about motivation that is almost entirely ignored in educational and organizational practice today. It's applications are broad and deep. There are many take-home messages and the writing style is enjoyable. You won't be disappointed with this book and I recommend it to almost anyone in any sphere of life.
B0047VSW30|4.0|That this movie got made at all is fairly amazing -- and in a totally different way and polar opposite from the vacuous crap oft spewing out of Hollywood (Hansel & Gretel I'm looking at you!).<br /><br />Agora is set during the tumultuous decades at the end of the 4th and early 5th century AD. It centers around the riots in the Egyptian city of Alexandria between various sects and factions. Between government and mob. Between pragmatists and fundamentalists. Sound familiar? It should. The same sort of thing is occurring today, 1600 years later. The period in the film, known as late antiquity, is an important one, because the order of the modern word was forged in these fires. Yet, most people, including a fair sprinkling of my Ivy League friends, know almost nothing about it. The average American would be lucky to know this is the same Alexandria that hosted the affairs of Cleopatra -- over 400 years earlier. They might not distinguish these sandal wearers from the spear toting Spartans of 300 -- but that battle occurred 900 years before this one! The ancient world is not one moment, but a vast progression of political and social evolution -- all informing our own world.<br /><br />Back to 400 AD and Alexandria. The city was a peculiar and important experiment. Founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC on the shores of the Mediterranean at the Nile delta, it was one of the most cosmopolitan in the world, being the poster child for the very idea of Hellenism and the its questioning and philosophic spirit. Perfect, no, but this is the city that housed the Great Library (which desired to obtain a copy of every work written by man) and taught and nurtured 700 years worth of scholars of all faiths. The Hebrew bible was translated here from Aramaic into Greek.<br /><br />Agora is not a perfect movie by any stretch, but it does an impressive job of bringing to life the grandeur, sadness, and dust of this ancient place. With superb costumes and by combining grand and detailed sets with judicious CG / Model aerial shots it's one of the best looking depictions of the ancient world I've  seen. It also does a great job with the substance, if not the detail of the history. The central figure is the female philosopher Hypatia, about whom relatively little is known. Her scientific role is a bit extrapolated, but the political situation is fairly faithful. In just a couple of decades Christianity goes from being a minor (and illegal) cult to the one and only state religion of the aging Roman Empire. It is at the hands of men like Saint Cyril of Alexandria (the villain of the film) that established the theological/political principle of religious intolerance that poisons our world today.<br /><br />Prior to this, men of all nations did their fair (and more) share of killing, usually over political and economic objectives. But in the polyglot world of antiquity, variation of belief was usually taken as a given, separate and outside the world of pragmatic gain (which generally took precedence).<br /><br />People constantly ask me (knowing I'm a Roman history buff) \\"how did Rome fall?\\" Well, when you watch how Cyril maneuvers the liberal Imperial Prefect Orestes you find one of the answers to this complex question. This moment, which appears roughly fairly faithful to historical sources , is about as brilliant a bit of political manipulation as the world has ever witnessed. Cyril, preaching from his pulpit, reads to assembled politicians from the bible, outlining his fundamentalist agenda, and then segueing into a question of faith, forces his opponents -- in front of the mob -- to kneel and declare their faith to the book (held aloft by him!). But what are they kneeling to? The power of God or the ambition of man?<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dreamd sets with judicious CG / Model aerial shots it's one of the best looking depictions of the ancient world I've  seen.

B004MPI5SS|1.0|I understand why this movie was under Horror because no other genre fits it but the description left out one key element to the movie...A very savage gang rape scene which in essence took up 2/3 of the movie and her revenge took up 1/3. I wish they mentioned the mentioned scene because it would have saved me $3.99. Not worth my time or money for a family movie night.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />Hitchcock (2012) is a story that centers around the period of time that Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma were working on the horror mega classic Psycho (1960) and the concern and negativity surrounding the whole idea and ultimately its making.  The cast is high caliber.  Anthony Hopkins plays Alfred Hitchcock.  He does an excellent job playing Hitchcock.  Helen Mirren plays Hitch's wife Alma.  She too does an excellent job.  Other cast members include Scarlett Johansson as Janet Leigh, Jessica Biel as Vera Miles, James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins, and Ralph Macchio as Joseph Stefano.  Scarlett Johansson is pretty much a carbon copy of Janet Leigh in this movie.  A dead ringer.  Jessica Biel is a dead ringer for Vera Miles, as is James D'Arcy as Anthony Perkins.  The acting by all involved is excellent.<br /><br />The Blu Ray's picture and sound quality are top notch.<br /><br />This movie is excellent, better than I expected.  It's great to see a movie made that centers around the greatest director of all time (in my opinion), Alfred Hitchcock.  Psycho was a huge hit, controversial, and groundbreaking for its time.  This movie delves into the behind the scenes drama that took place while getting this movie made.  For those of you not familiar with his work, check out some of his movies.  Start with Psycho, then maybe Vertigo (1958), The Birds (1963), North By Northwest (1959), Rear Window (1954), Strangers On A Train (1951), Rebecca (1940), Shadow Of A Doubt (1943), and Notorious (1946).<br /><br />I highly recommend Hitchcock.
B00B4VXQC8|5.0|This band is by far the most influential of our times and with the last tour Because We Can, Jon Bon Jovi demonstrates that he is an innate leader of this band and his music.Worth buying it
B00DJYK7PW|5.0|Not much more to be said about this album. If this is the new 'fusion,' we're in for quite a ride!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I read this without having read any other books in the series and it was an amazing stand alone! Can't wait to go back as start from the beginning of the series
B001GJOL22|5.0|Always nice to see a band that actually seems to like to play together.  Snakes and Arrows is full of interesting tunes which the band really flesh out.  Not to be missed by the fan and a good entry point for people who were wondering how Rush became 'cool' :-)
B000BZISTE|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time.  Most people remember the TV show, but the movie truly outdoes it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my third time reading this book and so after this I am gonna finish the rest of the series for a third time. Every time I read this it feels like I am reading it for the first time. THIS BOOK NEVER GETS OLD!!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Worried that I wouldn't be able to match the cord I accidently vacuumed.  Amazon does a great job with keeping me up with my Kindle Fire.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|am so glad finally released for the kindle please real well havent had<br />any problems with it as of yet
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|After reading reports I decided to take the chance and go straight to the Pro version. And I truly am amazed at the result.  I have been experiencing a problem where pages would slow to fully open and all too often fail to open completely.  I couldn't understand what was wrong. I now do. Too much much crap was running in the background. After using the Smart RAM Booster Pro app I am now seeing pages snap open.  In fact I am seeing them displayed even before the progress bar fully reaches its end. This app was worth every penny and then some.  Ten stars!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is a very convenient gadget, I don't have to always turn on my Netflix box,  When using my laptop I can cast from one tab and work with other multiple tabs, so I am no longer restricted to just watching, the ability to multi-task is awesome.  Casting does not work fully with some sites, perhaps future software updates will rectify that.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I actually enjoyed the first book. Great sex and an incredible experience, with the only way a relationship like this should end.  A marriage and children with this man is a recipe for disaster.  The second book was kind of fun to read but really she needs to walk away from this abusive, controlling man.
B005LAIHHC|4.0|Bluray is very Good.<br /><br />DVD : picture is very bad...<br /><br />Digital Copy: only available for us customers...<br /><br />Excellent Unrated Version.
B004EPYZXK|1.0|Thank goodness there is a fast forward button on the remote. One of the worst movies I have ever experienced.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I took me a while to connect and care about all the characters. But as the book progressed I became more enthralled with the sins of the parents and the sad affect they have on children. It was a good read, well done.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|A story of kids being friends in their early years, and remaining friends through bad times and through the good.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I've played adventure games since the days of Space Quest and King's Quest.  This one ranks right up there with those classics.  Right mix of challenge without being impossible. The voice acting could be better but what do you expect for 3 bucks?
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Not the typical role for Matthew.  His friendship he started with the boys was genuine.  A movie that has heart!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|fantastic. best kindle game i ve played. big improvement from dungeon hunter 3. i highly recommend this game. ok i need more words
B003JUGQ38|5.0|I love it because there is no limit to the situations that can happen. It gives you a lot of what if scenarios that could possibly happen
0345529057|3.0|in good shape upon arrival, given as gift so hope he enjoys them. that's all to say about this one sorry.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|My Husband loved all these books Season one though season eight<br />would recommend them to anyone who likes to read, Thanks
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Loved this book! Super fun and unexpected for a rom com. Love the voice of Emma. Beautifully done. She's a hilarious character and the supporting characters were well developed and endearingly quirky too.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|You just can't get the fun you got out of the first one.  This is ok.  But the first is still the best.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I invested hours into reading these books and for it to end this way makes me furious I understand why she wrote it that way but I believe the readers deserved a better ending
B0063M22QO|4.0|I think it's a good learning tool for my young Grandkids.<br />They are enjoying it.  It's fun for them and for me to watch them.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|These are some classic movies transferred to blu-ray and they are very nice.  The only worry I had was that the picture and sound might suffer from 2 movies on each disc.  The only movie by itself is the first film and wow, what difference.  The sound also sounds very nice.  It's also in a slim type case that takes up very little space on the shelf.
B009PMB3CI|5.0|I gave this game a 5 star but if I could I would give it a billion! So much fun it's like  having a pet and a friend it's so cute! I &lt;3 my Dalmatian
B00CATONCA|5.0|a show like the walking dead is going to keep releasing these special editions so that the fans will buy the hom version.  this s a replica of the governor's tank with the floating heads in it and it's made by the awesome McFarlane toys so you know the detailing is spot on.  as seen in the picture this tank lights up, can store the case fro the blu-rays and even fill it with water.  it has definitely raised the bar on cool special editions.  try to pick this up if you can
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|My grandson and I love to play this game on our computer, now we love to play it on my Kindle too!
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|this is easily the scariest movie I've ever seen.  it will not disappoint you and the hype around it is legit.  t has a good story and it;s actually based on real people/experiences.  it comes with the blu-ray, dvd, and the UV digital copy.  even the cover is a little freaky.  get this before Halloween is over and scare the life out of yourself!
B009NF54ZE|4.0|Very enjoyable with a nice variety of puzzles and challenges. Similar to Pirates 1. I did miss the dramatic voices in Vampireville by the same company but generally very good.
B006RXSM9A|5.0|I'm a song and dance freak, with a music major. I'm also a Chicago freak--lived either in city or not more than 14 miles outside for 53 years. It's &#34;My Kind of Town&#34;. This production was awesome due to the amazingly powerful performances by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zellweger--who'd a thunk they were song and dance dynamos? While I always love what sexy Richard Gere does, IMO he didn't deliver like the girls did. Now put Hugh Jackman in there and it's a trifecta!! And this was based upon a true story. Love Chicago's 'colorful' past, to say the least, and love all local shots, and the down-to-earth grittiness of it's residents. It's also the &#34;City With the Big Shoulders&#34;--people from all over the world have said that 'Chicago and Chicagoans are friendly and helpful and it's one of the most beautiful metropolises in the world. There's nothing that can't be accomplished in Chicago--like re-routing 8 lanes of Lake Shore Drive around the museums to create a museum campus. The movie has all the glitz and glamor with just enough murder and sleaze to make it an outstanding flick.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|Game animations make it more interesting to play. I enjoy this version , but the expert level is too easy and paying for each new season is not worth it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy crush is supper fun never boring love it. It has very good graphics love the colors and movements of the fruit.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|This is a beautiful CD and my all time favorite from Deva Premal. I love every single and I never get tired of listening to it whether I am teaching yoga or listening while driving to work., a must have!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Saw it in the theater.  Price of the Blue ray DVD  had dropped enough for me to add this to my collection.  It is a crowd pleaser if you have a big screen high def  TV.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Use this on my phone (Galaxy S3) and tablet (Galaxy Tab 2 10.1) and prior to that on a Xoom with no issues. Great app!
B0042TV4IW|3.0|I LOVE ENGLISH DRAMA BUT FIND THAT THIS IS AN INTERESTING DRAMA BUT DOES NOT HOLD THE CHARM OR THE DEPTH OF THE USUAL -- SUCH AS DOWNTON ABBEY OR CALL THE MIDWIVES.  I FIND IT RATHER HARD TO FOLLOW THE PLOT AT TIMES.  I WILL MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO WATCH BUT AM NOT TOTALLY DRAWN TO IT....
B005LAIIN0|4.0|a good movie . better than expected. I am not a brad pitt fan, and I believe someone else could have played his part, but he did a good job.
B004X4R49Y|1.0|WE WERE UNABLE TO GET THIS MOVIE TO STREAM ON OUR COMPUTER USING EITHER SAFARI OR CHROME. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON AMAZON!
B005KQVDH8|4.0|blu ray is clearly an upgrade. have enjoyed this movie for years and was happy to get it for a good price on blu. if you haven't seen it yet get it it is good for the whole family.
B008K7WCJM|2.0|This album seems to me like the same old thing wrapped up in a new bow. If like me, you've relegated those early Sonic Youth cd's to the bottom of your cd pile, you might want to skip this one. There was nothing wrong with the music necessarily, just not the vibe I'm on currently.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game.  its fun to play with my grandchildren. they love the whole ice age action.  i do too
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|I was pretty excited to see this movie but now that I've seen it, it definitely won't be added to my physical DVD collection.  I think they could've done much more with it than they did and I came up somewhat disappointed in it.  As always watch for yourself if you're a mech/sci fi lover and tell me what you think.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Some of the levels are to hard to win. I was stuck on level 70 for a long time. Sometimes I just don't feel like playing it anymore!
B00G32OER4|4.0|There are not a lot of movies that scare me anymore. Most are cheesy and you see stuff coming from a mile away...not The Conjuring!  Truly scary!
B008Y2X78S|5.0|great series! Finally getting caught up first two season! Im addicted! i miss the Sapranos...this surely has been a great replacement! Love the fiction with non fiction history!<br /><br />This
B0014VPFTA|1.0|&#34;Gravity,&#34; &#34;Say,&#34; &#34;Vultures,&#34; &#34;Bold as  love,&#34; &#34;Slow Dancing in a Burning Room,&#34; and of course &#34;Waiting On The World To Change,&#34; are all on this album.  &#34;Waiting on the world to change&#34; is as philanthropic as MJ's charitable efforts.
B00E3QJ7ZG|4.0|One of my favourite Clint Eastwood westerns  it's Classic atmospheric Thriller in the Western genre,  very errie film with a touch of the Supernatural like a Ghost story in the west  that's how i see the film  well written script, well actored and well Directed  if you want the plot of the film go to wikipedia.com  this review is about the difference between the DVD release and this new blu-ray release    i have the DVD release from 2002 which has an average widescreen transfer in Dolby digital sound only   but hardly no extras at all  the special features are Production notes and Theatrical trailer that's it.    Now Universal has re-issued this film as a 40th Anniversary edition blu-ray  well i expect a 40th Anniversary edition to have all new extras like a Documentary or featurette.  this new Blu-ray release has no new special features at all, just a Theatrical trailer  so i took a risk and bought it for $11 on amazon.com  cause on the back cover it says the movie has been restored and remastered    so when i got it i watch the film a bit just to check out the quality  the new blu-ray transfer for the picture quality is beautiful i must say  i was stunned and amazed on how Good it looks in 2:35:1 widescreen  much much better clearer picture quality than the 2002 dvd release  Universal really did make the effort to clean up the picture quality for sure  not much Grain on this blu-ray  plus the Audio quality has been boosted up for sure, a new 5.1 master audio mix  much better than the Dolby Digital sound from the dvd  it's tragic that Universal didn't make the effort with the special features at all  they cleaned up the picture quality for sure but didn't bother giving new special features     which is very disapointing and pathetic i'm a big fan of this film  what's the point advertising this new blu-ray as a 40th Anniversary edition when you get no new extras  there should be at least a new interview with Clint Eastwood or an Audio commentary   for fans like myself this new blu-ray is only Good to Upgrade from your dvd release  cause as i said the blu-ray transfer does look stunning and amazing, not much Grain at all  and the sound quality is boosted to 5.1 master audio    if you have the old dvd release, scrap it  time to upgrade to this new blu-ray release worth paying $11 for it off amazon  but Universal shouldn't have advertised it as 40th anniversary edition cause it isn't in my opinion  there are no new special features, so fans like myself should not be misleaded  but the blu-ray transfer is excellent thou  i gave this blu-ray 4 stars based on the new picture quality transfer
B0089LOG02|5.0|This really shows how life comes full circle. Great characters, how afraid these kids must have been. I never knew this existed.  A good read and I learned at the same time. I am involved in helping Arizona kids in foster care especially those who don't have a family or are aging out of care. Unfortunately there are still many kids without homes today
B009NX1YT6|4.0|excellent kids enjoyed the old school moves from Travolta and John... Laughed and enjoyed the music to the movie!!! Buy it
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I really loved Divergent and Insurgent kept the series going for me. This book started out okay but once they got on the outside it just lost the tone of the series for me. It seems like it focused too much on Tris and Tobias fighting and making up and then rushed through the action, the parts that actual added to the story. Aside from the annoying back and forth between Know-it-all Tris and Stubborn-little-boy Tobias, you had the conflict of the situation in Chicago and then the new GP vs GD conflict. Neither of which really had a satisfying resolution.  I mean Tris died to do the memory wipe but David as still in charge after that and what everyone was just magically living together in perfect GP/GD harmony? I was disappointed that Tris died but I was more disappointed that she didn't die for a good enough reason. If Amar could get Tobias and Christina could get into the city so easily and inoculate certain people against the memory serum why didn't they just do that. And it seems like Nita and Matthew could have figured out long ago to use the memory serum on everyone. Nita had planned to use the death serum, Matthew was against that why wouldn't he have suggested the memory serum as a compromise. And if David was so suspicious of Tris hanging out with GD people why would he make her part of his council? She came into the compound with her GD brother, best friend and boyfriend, she lived in the dorm with the same GD people the entire time and in the end her give away was she was spending too much time with GD people?  And then Tobias is able to end the entire conflict with the factionless by appealing to Evelyn's motherly side. A mother who abandoned him, used him, spent most of her life planning this rebellion and just went okay I will give up? And all the factionless who had been spit on their whole lives just went okay cool you have your son back let just forgive and forget. And the same thing with Marcus he starts to disagree with the compromise Evelyn sets up and the Joanna is just like no and he backs down. She threatens that she will expose him for refusing peaceful terms but why should that matter? I mean why didn't everyone reject him when they found out about his abuse and Tobias.  It doesn't even make sense that Joanna would have accepted him as a leader for the Allegiant in the first place. It felt like it was all forced for the end when Tobias has to \\"choose between his parents.\\" And then Marcus just disappears. And I didn't really feel clear on the whole experiment. So when there was a large population of Divergent they were supposed to come out and do what exactly? If they are trying to keep them in a controlled area until future generations are genetically repaired why leave so many GD on the outside, just to discriminate against them. The GP supposedly hated them and punished them to harshly while the GP got away with stuff. But when Tobias tried to help the rebels get ahold of the death serum they didn't really do anything to him. I didn't care for both perspectives. After the first two books it really messed with the flow of the series. Now I see the whole point was so Tris could be killed but it didn't feel like a natural progression of the series and aside from mentioning each others names it was easy to forget which person you were reading. Tobias's perspective didn't add to the story it distracted from it.  It felt like you were getting half a story from him and half a story from her, but since they were both doing such different things all the time you were never getting the full story. This whole book felt incomplete and forced. The resolutions weren't satisfying nor did they make sense for the series as a whole. The book was called Allegiant and so was the group that wanted factions back but the book didn't really have anything to with that. I would have called it Tangent because she started out telling the Divergent story but then got caught up in this other thing with genetic testing, and it gotconvoluted like she lost a clear vision for the story.  The characters felt like pawns, like Roth had forgotten the passion with which she built these strong characters in the first two books. She was just having them do whatever she wanted whether it was fitting to their character or not. If you are going to kill such a strong character like Tris then the death should feel impactful and meaningful, hers did not. Peter could have died long ago, he didn't need to be in this book. Who cares if he gets to start over and try to be a good person? So if you want to know what happens to the Chi town gang check it out at your library or borrow it from someone but don't spend your money. It isn't worth it. I don't even feel like it was worth the time I spent reading it.
B001BANK32|4.0|The book is def a mind thriller. Reading it in church is not a good idea though.  It has some parts that could have been tightened up but the book in whole is excellent.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love playing Candy Crush.  It is so addictive you can't stop.  I may try for weeks on end to try to get past one section but I keep trying,  It's like I can't let it beat me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down. I also was completely unable to guess what was coming. it was creepy, sad , exhilarating and hopeful all at once. I wanted a more straightforward ending, for good to triumph over evil. So I was somewhat discouraged. But there is more to this story.
B007FXLWKW|4.0|It a great movie! Our daughter watches it over and over! She tells us she wants to watch &#34;wabbit&#34;! Lol.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the diy ideas and the creativeness. This site brings out the Martha Stewart in me. From painting to baking this site has it all.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|this game sucksI hate it I don't like it at all sorry king.com it ducks I hate it terribull. iams
B00DW1WR14|3.0|I thought they could've put out a better product since it's been years since their last release.  In my opinion, it has one great song (Sirens) and three good songs (Getaway, Lightning Bolt & Future Days)- the rest is very average, some better than others.  It's probably my own fault for being disappointed- as I figured it would be a great cd.  If I had to do it over, I would just buy the single: Sirens.  That's why they call it art- the members of the band are probably very proud of it.  Just didn't live up to my expectations, which were high.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addictive and now i can play on my kindle and save my battery on my phone!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|The CGI in this film was top notch. The acting was good and story line somewhat original. This is not for children under 13. Too graphic in some scenes. I enjoyed watching this film but will not be adding it to my collection.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I loved the first two books in this trilogy...enjoyed rereading them in preparation for Allegiant.  Calling this book a disappointment is a gross understatement.  Did Roth really write this book?  Where were her editors?  Tris and Tobias were barely recognizable as the characters I met and loved in Divergent and Insurgent.  Action(for a 549 page book) was scarce.  Tris' and Tobias' attraction to each other and their relationship was like a sidebar without the passion and urgency of the other books.  Roth portrayed Tobias as a whiney little kid...where did that come from, for heaven's sake???  The explanations for the \\"experiments\\" seemed contrived with lots of loopholes.  The plot seemed rushed, even though it was a very long book.<br /><br />\\"SPOILER ALERT\\"  DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK.<br /><br />How could Roth kill off Tris?  It made no sense except that she did it for shock value.  Her loyal readers deserved better than this.  Now,I can't reread the series because I know Tris dies. I was looking forward to the movies, but I will not go to see them now.  Yes, I know that the author can do whatever she likes with her characters, but I can certainly choose not to read her books. She killed off several favorite characters, wasn't that enough.  I am so disappointed.  I enjoy reading good books several times and now I won't with this series, nor will I read anything else written by Veronica Roth.  She deals with betrayals in her books and I feel like she betrayed her readers.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I loved the series, but the ending was slightly disappointing. Hence the 3 stars. Would recommend though because i could not set down these books once i started the series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Oh what fun and very addicting once you get starting playing this game you don't want to stop a wonderful game
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I had read 'Kite Runner' last year and that is when i fell in love with this Author and his tales of friendship, love, hope. This book is no different. Two stories of women living in Afghanistan in the middle of war, they are brought together, and something happens that changes both of their lives. Highly recommend this, will bring tears of sadness, then joy to your eyes.
B009GEDP26|5.0|My wife and I are great fans of the show...  Amazon Prime made it very easy to stream the show.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I cant want for more apps and websites to officially support this!<br /><br />it works great, I use it to watch ABC.com shows since I can never be home to watch them live. it streams webpages &#34;good enough&#34; but would be amazing if websites like ABC, NBC, and FOX would officially support this device.<br /><br />I love that it can stream my entire computer including the desktop to the TV.<br /><br />I don't have a USB port on my TV only a service port that Google says not to use. but the power cord works just fine!
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|this movie is trying to be MIB but it does fall short. with that said I like it. its has it's funny parts, it's a new look on the after life; moreover it is not a slow movie.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Loving the game and totally worth the five star with the multiplayer being so smooth.No problems with this game. Definitely a recommended on my list
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|love the show! love the acting! LOVE harvey specter!!! full of drama and character. well developed plots and clever humor,
B004EPZ07U|3.0|This movie gets a lot of criticism mostly about its story and visuals (which I think I read were rushed into post-production?). And while its fine to criticize a movie it is also \\"ok\\" to enjoy one, even with flaws. Ryan Reynolds does a marvelous job bringing the beloved character to the big screen and despite its poor box office earnings and visual issues/script issues I think it is a shame they will most definitely reboot the character with another actor. Having said that, its worth a watch.<br /><br />Note: The extended edition doesn't make the movie really any better, or worse. So don't feel you must have it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book!  It is back to basics and classic Stephen King!  I had a hard time putting it down to go to work, or sleep, or the bathroom!  Outstanding!
B0083SBJXS|3.0|The Avengers, good but not great. The hype, buzz, whatever you'd like to call it worked and made The Avengers one of the most successful films of all time. Did it deserve it? Not in my opinion, no. Overall the action was fantastic but as usual Whedon is praised with uneven dialogue that is beloved by many, but not myself. As a director though he is fantastic. I do recommend this film however even with its uneven dialogue and I must admit I thought Captain America's suit was a tad terrible I am glad its a bit improved in \\"Winter Soldier\\" (judging by the trailer).<br /><br />3 out of 5 stars.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|A far easier book to get across the social and economic changes that preceded World War I, than any I have read in the past, which all seemed to repeat the ideas of the perpetrators, rather than the facts on the ground, and the utter stupidity of going to war over an assa sskination
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Cruise delivers yet another Science Fiction masterpiece! However this time, its his best. Oblivion centers around a mop up crew awaiting to go \\"home\\" when Jack Harper (Cruise) begins to unravel the truth. I highly recommend this film it is arguably the best science fiction film of the year only behind (Gravity). A must watch for Cruise or Science Fiction fans.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Wonderful read - couldn't put the book down.  Helped me to understand what goes on when someone is diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|The best Marvel film (from the studio) to date! This film was so visually stunning and well acted that I can't help but say \\"thank you!\\" to the director. The film really shocked me when I first saw it in theaters thinking \\"how can they make Thor into a movie?\\". Well they did, successfully. I highly recommend this film to anyone fan or not. I am awaiting Thor : The Dark World with open arms, :).<br /><br />4.5/5 stars.
B008HK3QII|5.0|Amazon hasn't updated the page to say so, but this sleeve fits the 7\\" HDX perfectly. I had a KF HD already and tried the new HDX in the case before I ordered one for it. The Timbuk2 cases aren't as fancy as some others, but they protect the devices very well,
0375842209|5.0|I loved the book and made it read to my then 12 years old. He really &#34;enjoyed&#34; it, and the book triggered a lot of dinner conversations.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|*spoiler alert*<br />The book is amazing, but... I can't believe Roth would do this to us.. I hate her so much for killing Two really great characters... And I'm glad they finally fixed the anti-Divergent sentiments, although the genetically damaged thing was a bit much. It was kinda hard to keep track of GD and GP. And Caleb finally earned back his respect from me... Read, read, READ THIS BOOK!

1936608898|5.0|It is official! I just completed my first whole 30! While my first whole 30 is over, my journey to getting back on track is going strong. For so many years I have been hiding from life. Terrified of running into someone who knew me before I had kids. Terrified of the \\"Wow, she let herself go\\" look that I would see on their faces, whether it was actually there or not. Ashamed that I didn't look like a hollywood mom. That I gained too much weight durning my pregnancies and didn't instantly fit back into my pre-pregnancy pants... or even years later.<br />For me this journey has been about more than just food. It is about learning to put me back on my list of priorities. A hard thing to do then you are the mother of 4, but I am doing it. I am also trying to realign my thinking. Instead of despising my body for not looking like it did when I was 24, I am going to start loving it for all of it's amazing capabilities. This body created four of the most amazing children to ever walk this planet. It allowed me to give birth to them without pain medication, and in doing so made me realize just how powerful I really am. My arms have provided the ultimate home base for my children. To comfort them when they are sick, scared or sad, or just cuddle them to let them know how amazingly loved they are. It has kept me going, when I thought I was too tired or too sad to go on. My breasts have provided the perfect nourishment for those children (and if you have seen my babies, you would know just how well fed they have been  ) , and even allowed me to help supply milk to a baby in need.<br />It has more than earned the rights to my love, and from now on, I am going to start giving it that love.<br />It has been a hell of a month, and I can't wait to see where my journey will take me.<br />*A happy side note. During the last 30 days I have lost 17 pounds, but more importantly, my husband has lost 22 and is no longer pre-diabetic. Yay!

It's a classic tale of Good vs. Evil, in some part reminiscent of &#34;The Stand&#34;, as the tension builds toward the inevitable clash.  Mr. King has done an outstanding job of creating likable, sympathetic characters in this action-packed and emotional  &#34;sequel&#34; to &#34;The Shining&#34;.  It has, indeed, been great to find out what happened to Danny Torrance.

B000QQH4YS|5.0|Robocop is another classic in the camp of movies that fused sci-fi with action.  I've been a fan of this movie since the mid-late 90's, and I'd go as far to say that this is one of the best sci-fi/action movie hybrids ever made.  Like many of the other great action movies from the 80's and early 90's, Robocop thrives on more than action scenes since there's substance to be found aplenty as well, thus why it has such a high rating.  Anyway, on to the review.<br /><br />STORY<br /><br />Robocop takes place in a near-future Detroit, and it's a grimy place replete with crime.  The shady megacorporation Omni Consumer Products (OCP) has taken over many parts of the city, including the Detroit Police Department, and even plans to renovate Detroit into a metropolis they'll own called Delta City.  At OCP headquarters, junior executive Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer) takes advantage of senior executive Dick Jones's (Ronny Cox) disastrous demonstration of his ED-209 law enforcement droid (resulting in a brutally murdered executive) to propose to the OCP president known as the Old Man (Dan O'Herlihy) a prototype for his product known as \\"Robocop\\" (which the Old Man approves).  A good cop named Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) gets transferred to Detroit and gets brutally murdered by infamous criminal Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith) and his cronies.  Murphy gets transformed into Robocop and is rapidly cleaning up the streets.  Following this is a search for one's humanity, a violent struggle between OCP executives, and bringing the scum to justice.<br /><br />CHARACTERS<br /><br />One of the things that makes Robocop such a great movie are the characters.  They all have distinctive personalities and neat yet believable nuances that make them memorable and fit this type of a movie like a glove.  Murphy is a superb protagonist for the fact that in the beginning, it's shown that he's only human and not your typical action star at all.  His transition into Robocop is amazing because like a proper cyborg, Robocop doesn't show any emotion or any independent thought, acting according only to his programming...until his memories come back later on in the movie.<br /><br />Boddicker is an excellent villain in this movie because aside from being so loathsome, there's a bit of charm and dark humor to go with his character as well.  This is evident when before Boddicker kills Murphy, he says to him in a swaggering tone \\"See, I have this problem.  Cops don't like me, so I don't like cops,\\" blows off Murphy's right hand with a shotgun, and tells his cronies \\"Give the guy a hand!\\"  It's worth noting that for Kurtwood Smith, director Paul Verhoeven had Smith wear glasses for his role because according to Verhoeven, Smith wearing rimless glasses reminded him of Heinrich Himmler.  It's crazy to think that Smith would eventually play Red Forman on That 70's Show, but I guess it's a testament to Smith's talent since he can play such differing roles and nail them perfectly.<br /><br />Jones is perfect as the corrupt corporate criminal out to decimate anyone in the company that gets in his way, and his character is done so well that you wouldn't suspect that he's one of the main villains until you see that he actually collaborates with men like Boddicker to help achieve Jones's goals.<br /><br />Other characters, like Morton and Murphy/Robocop's partner Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) are done well within their characters and help enhance the movie.<br /><br />THEMES/SATIRE<br /><br />The core theme of Robocop is regaining one's humanity.  To go into this in detail would spoil a lot of the movie, so I'll just let you know that it's handled really, really well.<br /><br />The satire in Robocop is handled really well, too.  There's plenty of scenes depicting newsclips and people who don't seem to mind when brutal violence occurs before them, possibly jabbing at other action movies that rely too much on gory content or society's increasing desensitization to violence and worldcatastrophes.  I think the satire is best highlighted toward the beginning in Mr. Kinney's death by the ED-209 and when Morton leaves with his friend from the meeting, he calmly says \\"It's a shame what happened to Mr. Kinney\\" instead of being distraught in any way.<br /><br />ACTION SCENES<br /><br />With Robocop being an action movie, action scenes are naturally important, and thankfully, these don't disappoint.  Towards the beginning, Murphy and Lewis chase down Boddicker and his gang on the road, and this has some creative action going on.  This has both the protagonists and antagonists using creativity in attempts to one-up their adversaries, such as when Bobby, one of Boddicker's cronies (who burned up a lot of the money they stole in a recent heist) gets wounded, Boddicker and his pals throw him out of the van and into Murphy and Lewis's car.<br /><br />The action scenes with Robocop are awesome because they show that while at first, Robocop is a seemingly unstoppable cyborg, there's still moments where he has to rely on intuition and creativity to overcome certain obstacles.  The best example of Robocop's creativity overcoming certain enemies is when the ED-209 has inflicted quite a bit of damage to Robocop, and Robocop escapes the droid by going down a flight of stairs, which he knows the ED-209 can't walk on due to its cumbersome feet, resulting in something rather bizarre and hilarious with the droid growling and then crying like a stuck animal.  The two best action scenes in this movie are when Robocop takes down a cocaine factory and in his final showdown with Boddicker and his cronies, but I don't want to spoil much here on this.<br /><br />SPECIAL EFFECTS<br /><br />Rob Bottin, who handled the near-perfect special effects in John Carpenter's The Thing, created the Robocop suit and the gore/violence effects for the characters.  Bottin's creation of the Robocop suit is a true testament to his talent because aside from making such slimy, ugly creatures in The Thing, he made one of the most authentic, convincing cyborg suits ever made in cinema.  When you see Murphy encased in the suit, you really feel like you're looking at a real cyborg and not someone in a rubber suit or C-3PO outfit.<br /><br />The gore effects look impressive as well, such as the scenes where Murphy gets shot to death by Boddicker's gang and when Mr. Kinney gets blown away by the ED-209.  It looks extremely painful and authentic to see unfold.  There's also a scene towards the final showdown where Emil, one of Boddicker's cronies, gets drenched in toxic waste and mutates into an indescribable monstrosity.  Emil looks really creepy in this state and it hardly feels like cinema fakery when this happens.<br /><br />Stop-motion animator Phil Tippett animated the movements of the ED-209 and while I admit that the movements certainly show the age of the movie, they hardly deter the quality of the movie itself since everything else is top notch.<br /><br />The visuals and props in this movie perfectly fit the near-future vision of Detroit.  The skyscrapers have a contemporary yet slightly futuristic feel to them, and the abandoned steel mill that Boddicker's gang hides out in is desolate and grimy, perfectly fitting the movie.  What I found the most neat are the guns. Robocop's Auto 9 pistol is really a Beretta 93R with an extended barrel to make it look like a really deadly, futuristic handgun (and it succeeds).  The Cobra anti-material rifles that Jones arms Boddicker's gang to hunt Robocop with are Barrett M82 .50 caliber sniper rifles equipped with large, rectangular scopes to make them look more high-tech.  Boddicker's pistol is a Desert Eagle with an extended tip mounted on the end, and all of these guns look cool.<br /><br />SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />Basil Poledouris composed the music for this movie, and he did a great job at it.  The main theme of the movie is very memorable and ear-grabbing.  He's also skilled at crafting pieces of music that fitthe tones of certain scenes in the movie without degrading in quality.<br /><br />A neat fact is the music played in the nightclub where Robocop apprehends Leon Nash, one of Boddicker's cronies, is a song called \\"Show Me Your Spine,\\" created by PTP, one of Al Jourgenson's (Ministry) side projects at the time.  It's a cool electronic/industrial tune, and anyone who's a fan of the genre should check out the full song.<br /><br />MATURE CONTENT<br /><br />This is not a movie for the kids because there's plenty of really grizzly gore throughout the movie and a great deal of very salty language as well.  There's scenes of people getting shot to death, dismembered, show in the genital areas, and even shanked in the neck.  Towards the beginning, in the locker room of the police department, there's some shots of both male and female nudity, too.<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />While Total Recall will be my favorite Paul Verhoeven movie, Robocop is a very, very close second.  Robocop is a classic cyberpunk action movie, and is mandatory viewing for people who love either action movies or cyberpunk movies (or like me, who love both).  Get this movie if you haven't already.The Thing, he made one of the most authentic, convincing cyborg suits ever made in cinema.

B007VDN1PA|3.0|It's a nice little scanner if you have a bunch of family pictures you want to scan.  The problem I have with it is that it doesnt connect directly to your computer.  After you scan your negatives on to a SD memory card that must be purchased and inserted into the machine, you have to put that into a card reader and download onto computer via USB.  That extra step more than doubles the amount of time it takes to scan save and upload to your computer.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was the one  of the  best books I have ever read! The author puts so many twists and turns in the plot that it's sad yet addictive and good. Veronica Roth had put her best into this wonderful and she deserves a round of applause. Never the less, this book is probably the best one of the series.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a fantastic book which kept me guessing and is worth a second read - very soon!  I would definitely recommend this to a friend.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|It was not what I expected...it was a lot more human and vulnerable than what I expected to find. I have not seen the movie. I enjoyed the journey.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is fun, frustrating, surprising, & it's like a puzzle to complete the levels.  I only wish that you were able to start with more than just 5 uses.  I am so happy that it is now available on my Kindle Fire.  Thank you for making Candy Crush Saga available to Kindle owners.  I love my Kindle Fire!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a fun and challenging game.  There are many levels to master.  The levels are often difficult and challenging.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I did not want to believe the reviewers. I picked up Divergent by chance one day at Wal-Mart of all places and have been in love with it since. I enjoyed Insurgent too. And if you are reading these reviews and saying to yourself 'surely the dual povs can't be as bad as what everyone is saying - I mean how hard is it to tell two characters apart?' Think again: it is that bad. And if it were the only bad thing, I could get over it. Unfortunately....<br /><br />Why even name this book Allegiant? There was hardly anything about the Allegiant in it! It would have been a great book if it had been about the power struggle between Allegiant/Factionless and Evelyn/Johanna/Marcus. That would have worked! Those three characters have been built up. They are solid. We know who they are. Everyone who is saying David is weak in comparison are right. In fact, this should have been what this third book was about. And the damaged genes storyline should not have even been introduced until the late parts of this story. It would have worked as two books. This feels rushed, which probably meant it IS rushed.<br /><br />Also and lastly - this is the big one. The spoiler you may want to turn back now on before you see it. Tris's death was pointless. It's not just that it was disappointing or sad. It was pointless! There was no reason to do that when they already had a willing sacrifice. It made so much more sense to let Caleb go through with it because a)he actually had some serious things to atone for, thus giving it meaning b)seeing how Triss dealt with that would have been much more interesting.<br /><br />I have no idea how this got the editor's approval. Any editor's approval. And the plots holes.It just....I hate saying this. I don't think I've felt this let down since I read the 'Matched' trilogy and that was downright awful. It's too bad I just didn't get his from a library. Then at least I could have sent it back.
B0048PU7TC|4.0|Norah gets together with other great musicians.<br />19 tracks makes this a great bargain.<br />Those two alone makes it a winner.<br />Favorite tracks are 2 with the Foo Fighters, track 4 with Willie Nelson (which is a classic Christmas Jazz song), track 5 is a country song. I am not a country fan but this one zips along like a fine little doggie.<br />Track 7, Ruler of My Heart with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band is one of the best tracks. Norah is the main vocal on it too. This type of song is really her bailiwick and I would love to see more like this in the future.<br />Track 8 is superb with OutKast. Track 10 with Talib Kweli is lovely except for the rap interjections. WHY?! (Oh, because it “features” Norah so, Talib can do that. I guess.<br />There are other terrific tracks with some better than others. Not being a country fan, the Dolly Parton track might be incredible but, I just don't know (or care). Track 16 with Herbie Hancock is a good blending of Norah and his music. Is that good or bad, I am not sure. In a way, that is the challenge this album puts fourth: is it a Norah Jones or a bunch of musicians who just happen to have Norah with them when they make music? The title of the album does not lie. … Featuring (Norah Jones or featuring the musician, it depends)<br />Track 17 with guitarist Charlie Hunter is a remake of the great Roxy Music Avalon album song. It doesn't cut any new ground but is a very good version in a smooth jazzy way. Track 19 is smooth and silky. Good mix of voices.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love all of Steven Kings books. Read the Shining years ago and has always been my favorite SK book. Couldn't wait to read Doctor Sleep and it has lived up to my expectations.
B004NDVJA0|5.0|Obel is popular in Europe but not as well known in the U.S. I found her via Pandora when one of her songs came up on a station I had created.<br />I am not a music reviewer so, I won't go into each song in detail (which I find dull as a reader anyway) but, I actually enjoy this album as a whole. Songs in order of the play list or random order.<br />I listened to it for about 3 weeks non stop, I liked it so much. I don't normally do that.<br />Sample some of the songs. If you like them, get it. I think it will be one of those long lived classics like that French Jazz/electronic album Tourist by St. Germain from the early 90s. It is still popular today but, it took a decade to surface and be notable as a classic. But aren't many innovative AND popular albums like that!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is possibly the most visually evocative book I've ever read. Lush, gorgeous, colorful prose brings to life the titular circus as a phenomenally creative and unique story setting. So often I'm disappointed when stories claim &#34;unique and magical&#34; settings that awe their characters, when really, as a reader, they're places I've already seen a hundred times. No so here. Morgenstern has created a spectacle of wonder and imagination that leaps right off the page. The mystery of the plot and the charming characters end up taking a bit of a backseat to the overall splendor of the descriptive prose, but they provide more than enough steam to power the story forward. One of the best books I've read this year.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Had trouble keeping everyone straight in the beginning of the book.  When the secret was revealed it explained much.<br />Also,  never open something that says &#34;do not open until.&#34;
B00G32TD98|4.0|The movie was pretty good considering most horror movies that are released lately.  Mostly predictable scares, but they were done with a little imagination rather than the worn out methods.  It kept our attention throughout and scared 66.6666666% of us.  Worth watching for the $4.99 price tag.
B000J159N8|4.0|A lot of blood and guts and an unusual setting.  I liked the rough but human aspects.  Very different from other Mel Gibson movies.
B000069KE0|5.0|My favorite Chicago album, and I have the around 10 of them. Learned to play bass to Pete Cetera from this one especially.<br />I have most of them on vinyl dating back many years, but the  remastered sound of this CD,  took me back to the pleasure of<br />enjoying this incredible band all over again and  as fresh as I remembered from my youth.  Chicago really covered all &#34;basses&#34; with their individual virtuosity and the variety of styles included on this recording;  from their hallmark jazz/rock ( e.g 25 or 6 to 4 etc ) right through to the hauntingly evocative, orchestral/classical sounding  &#34;A.M. Mourning, P.M Mourning, Memories Of Love.<br />After their wonderful  first &#34;Chicago Transit Authority&#34; , this second album really does see the band develop and blossom.<br />moz.

B004G7UTXG|3.0|The movie was well acted, but by today's standards plot development took way too long and was extremely slow at some points. However seeing Robert and Liam early on in their acting careers was entertaining to say the least. The movie conclusion left much to be desired.

B0024FAR5M|1.0|The reason I &#34;hate&#34; it is because it was damaged.  Disk 1 will not play at all.  There was no instructions on what to do if I wanted to return it, so it's just sitting here, useless.  Could you give me some information on what to do if I receive defective merchandise from Amazon?
B00E3IZIM0|1.0|When I saw Pacific Rim on Amazon, I was so excited. Then I saw the price - $15. After reading the movie details, I saw that the $15 was to purchase the movie. I do not want to  buy the movie  -- yet! I want to rent it and if I like it well enough, I will buy it. When Pacific Rim was released on Blu-ray and DVD I though, okay now is my chance to rent it!  Surprise! NOT! and the price has gone up! What is going on Amazon? I gave a rating of 1 star so I could post my comment.

B00EHMG358|4.0|Ah Pendergast, you have returned and I am so very glad to see you are back in form. Preston & Child have also returned to form with White Fire, providing their mix of suspense and thriller with bits of historical background to support the present day story.<br /><br />Another good element here is the presence of Corrie Swanson, Pendergast's very bright, but somewhat brash, protegee first met in Still Life With Crows. She has come to Colorado to work on her thesis in forensics by studying the bones of early miners. Very quickly things turn wrong---and ugly. There are secrets in the mountains, secrets among the exceedingly rich who live there, and soon an arsonist who ups the ante.<br /><br />This book kept me reading quickly, straight through and is highly recommended to all you Pendergast lovers out there.<br /><br />Those who haven't discovered this series---give yourselves a treat. Start with Relic or Brimstone or the book I've mentioned above. Or perhaps start here and go back and fill in the missing parts. Lot's of thrills to be had.<br /><br />A strong 4*<br /><br />This book was received from publisher through NetGalley without commitment for favorable review.
B001O4WNCE|5.0|I hosted a public movie night and had to pay $300+ for the rights, but I ordered this collector's edition as a back-up and for my own personal collection.  I am so much more satisfied with the ~$10 I paid for both movies instead of the overpriced single movie I paid for with a distributing company.  Set came wrapped and in perfect condition.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|this game is exactly like league of legends but the controls in the game are terrible, some heroes are too over powered. this game needs s lot of work like the bots are retarded lol. all in all for a tablet game it is good, but there is so much more work needed on the gams
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The Marware Vibe Kindle case is very functional for me. It also keeps my device safe and secure. I like it a lot.
B002JC9RMY|4.0|I understand why everyone is so against how this movie was made and how a number of things is just flat out wrong. But I have to say that I liked the movie's own little uniqueness. I liked the actor that played Master Roshi. What I didn't like was Goku being played by a white guy while his grandfather was asian. Ok sure so grandpa found him as a baby shortly after crash landing on earth. Still, I think it would have suited dragonball far more had they chosen a japanese actor to play Goku. I'm sure he would have nailed Goku better than any other race playing Goku.<br /><br />I have a few other gripes, but I think giving a few praises ought to be considered since there's already more than enough bad reviews about the movie.<br /><br />I liked how Goku was raised by his grandpa up until his high school years. That at least gave Goku more time to spend with his grandpa before Gohan was killed.<br /><br />I liked the fighting styles between Goku and grandpa Gohan at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />And last, I like how Bulma was played, how she doesn't take any crap from men who try to pull a fast one on her (like grabbing her rear)
B000OCXIDK|5.0|You always wonder about the &#34;behind&#34; of any fabulous painting.  Although this is a work of fiction, I was wrapped into the story because it felt so real.  Definitely a must read for those who love art.
B00FGM0JTY|5.0|This is a great movie, not only for people interested in the making of great music, but for everyone who loves a great story.  Photographed beautifully, it offers insight into the life of a man who grew up in poverty in the South and became one of the most sought-after producers in the music industry.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Ms. Kline weaves a wonderful tale of two very different but very much the same women: both survivors, both strong-willed, both able to defeat harsh odds.  I stayed up all night to finish it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like this game, wish you could play more face book games on the kindle. I really like my kindle by when you want to search the web it's not that easy rather use the computer.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|I think this is great. I haven't learner it all. But I will soon! I love the SMURFS! So um uh yeah
B00DJYJQ36|5.0|truly one of the best of 2013. what a wonderful third act to to now trilogy. delby and hawke are amazing.
1409303187|5.0|My daughter love it!!! She is a great fan of Peppa Pig and her family.  She read them everyday!!! Highly recommend for young children to who started to read.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I'm a collector of great books, and this series by Martin is definitely a keeper. I almost hate for the series to end.
B005PK553C|5.0|Really didn't give the series it's just consideration during the regular season. I confess I have begun waiting to watch almost all series just so I don't have to wait weeks to see the next one but merely seconds for the downloads. This holds true for all of them. The subject is adult and the story well woven together and I enjoy as the characters begin to realize what is happening around them. Well done... well done. HBO was a pioneer and then everyone began to challenge them. Much of that was on private network and dealt with adult themes like... Adults! This regular network paring is equal too and better than much that came before and now.<br />THANK YOU for bringing me to American Horror.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Great sequel to the first season. Can't wait for season three. I loved the books and also love the show.
0374533555|5.0|Excellent insight in the human thinking process.  It explains a lot about what influences the decision making process.  It is somtimes a bit repetitive, but the research and content are first rate.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book is extraordinary.<br />Thank I loved ever word of it.<br />Never knew this part of our American History even existed,<br />to think what they did to these children & what happen to some of them, &<br />going from foster home to foster home & no one would adopt them.<br />I was spellbound over this I have told other people they have to read this.<br /><br />It's  like the Holocaust people won't talk about it<br /><br />Thank goodness Vivian shared her story with Molly to let us in on her life.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I find this amazingly easy to play on the Kindle Fire and I was actually able to complete a level on the Kindle Fire that I'd been unable to beat on my desk top. {Perhaps just luck, but I was impressed!}
1401938906|5.0|Excellent Excellent Excellent Book.  The Information is very helpful and life changing.  it is a must read for every one.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I just didn't like the way the game played out on the Kindle Fire... had nothing to do with the Kindle Fire... it was the game itself.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love this show<br />I just finished season 1 of my SOA binge watch<br />Season 1 was excellent -  Jackson is Hot!
B0089LOG02|5.0|I liked this book because it brought to light a topic you knew was out there, but never gave it a lot of thought.  Reading the book did that
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|Cannot imagine how he could have ever been nominated for any literary prize.  The idea for the book was solid,  but the execution defies belief.
B008EL25LE|4.0|Fun and Interesting game.  Different power-ups keep the game varied as you advance through levels.  Difficulty is appropriate and graphics are great.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed.
0307341550|5.0|The deaths of children are the foundation of the plot so for folks that really can't read that kind of stuff--- pass on this one. For those of you that can look past that you'll find rich character development, twisted families & communities - actually a little haunting - and a chilling ending! I loved it, passed it around the book club. We all got the creeps and we all loved the book!
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Great movie pack. I order this just for the 3D Disc. This movie alone is worth the price charged. ENJOY!!!!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|Does not work at all like the video showed.  Tried on 4 wine bottles, followed instructions to the letter, and unsuccessful on all attempts.  Returned for refund.  Do not waste your money!
0062086529|5.0|A great story about as little boy and his imagination.  It has become a favorite bedtime story for my son.
B00F56AZK4|4.0|I love this game.  However I am disappointed that you only get a handful of puzzles with it and then have to buy packs for $2 after that.  I love the Van Gogh pack of puzzles though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can not seem to put it down even when it is time to go to bed.  it is so much fun
B0027MJU00|3.0|Gillian Flynn's follow-up to Gone Girl isn't bad - just not as engaging as its predecessor. The resolution also seems rushed and cliched.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it couldn't put it down. Great read. Would recommend to friends. Would read more books from this author. Excellent
B006GWO5NE|1.0|kindle fire now dead.  could not charge.  worked for a few days and now it will not stay connected to charge
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for CCS to come on Kindle now that it's here I cant put it down. I am very happy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for candy crush to be available on kindle.  This is a very addictive game so beware.  But I love it.  I love the graphics and I enjoy the competition in my head with my fellow facebook friends.
B005PK56TA|5.0|The best horror/thriller I have ever seen. Every episode had us jumping to wrong conclusions. Mostly the wrong ones..  It was fun!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This awesome production. I love it.. Only problem is limited to YouTube access. Installation is very easy. Performance is excellent.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm thrilled that Kindle finally decided to make Candy Crush Saga available on the Kindle. I have the Fire HD and I'm loving it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book it is cool,an kinda funny<br /><br />I'd say adults and kids over 9 should read this it is AWSOME!
1476727651|4.0|I hope Doctor Sleep marks the beginning of a number of sequels for Stephen King because the book is a brilliant and effortless return to The Shining and protagonist Danny Torrance.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER: In short the book picks up primarily with Torrance in his 40's and fighting the demons his dad fought. In process he comes across a young girl not unlike a cross between Young Danny from The Shining and Carrie White from Carrie (if she had grown up reasonably well adjusted). The girl, Abra Stone, is a phenomenal talent in the are of shining but is being stalked by a group of individuals with psychic abilities who prolong their lives by draining (ala vampires) other unsuspecting young psychic victims. They want Abra. We'll leave it there.<br /><br />King's strongest point is the creation of believable characters that we can relate to and this strength shines here (pun sort of intended).<br /><br />This is not so much a horror novel as it is a suspense thriller with psychic phenomena. The read is incredibly quick and VERY worthwhile showcasing King as the master story teller he is.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the last 100 pages feel a little rushed and possibly could have benefited from a slower pace or a doubling in length.<br /><br />All in all a fantastic read that one can pick up having read The Shining or not (but if you have not you should and will enjoy Doctor Sleep even more for having done so). Highly recommended. Now lets get a sequel to Firestarter, Pet Cemetary, and Salem's Lot!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My wife and daughter absolutely loved this movie.  The singing and dancing were out of this world.  Highly recommend it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I gave this rating for one reason only - reading a book closely related to my personal life is spooky and cannot go higher with out showing my own life.  Sounds weird but truthful.  The author did a great story line about a small boy training for bigger than life adjustments but it also angered me because he never had a normal life as we know it.  He would become something that all admired but he did not understand.  I truly enjoyed this book.  Thanks for a wonderful story.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Having had kids and now grand kids, you get use to watching cartoons with them.  I really got interested when computer animation took off, also I like to look for the goofs (bloopers) in movies.  I was blown away that Adam Sandler was Dracula, I am usually pretty good at recognizing voices on cartoons.  Good movie, will watch over and over again (and not because one of the grand kids wants to see it again and again).  When Disney's  little mermaid came out, my youngest wanted to watch it all the time, pretty bad when as an adult you can sign all the songs in the movie, LOL
B00ET47USI|5.0|I have had a few of these &amp; this is by far the best.  The animation makes it fun and the options are easy to use.  I recommend this game especially since there are no ads to endure.  Well worth it and very entertaining.
006202406X|5.0|I must say I was very taken aback by the low ratings I saw here.  I thought this book was brilliantly written.  No, I never would have foreseen this ending, but I thought the whole book's themes were very powerful.  I thought this book was the best of the three.  The first seemed a lot like The Giver and Hunger Games; the second was like City of Ember.  Allegiant was very original and unpredictable; it forces the reader to consider what bravery/courage really means, how vital choice is to life... I really loved this trilogy.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|After byour first few rounds it wants you to buy more turns, 5 extra.  then after a few more you can buy more.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked this much better than the movie. The book focus more on how hungry they all were. Seemed like the movie just brush on it like an after thought. It was a good read.
B004JMY312|5.0|Hocus Pocus should be watched at the beginning of the Halloween season and again and again throughout the season.  A fun mixture of scary and funny.
1476734941|5.0|I just got low sodium low fat soup to eat twice a week, lol After you have been eating full meals the rest of the time, worth the read though.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Sheryl Crow rules in this one.<br /><br />Star Trek Fan&#34;s will like it.<br /><br />New Comer's will enjoy as well. Must have if you have the collection of all ST Movie's
B008XCJ03K|4.0|I like this ok, the singer's voice takes a little bit to get used to, but the songs are catchy. There were extra tracks on it, but they were basically repeats of earlier songs, slightly changed, so it tends to get a little boring. But these are pretty decent songs and I actually liked it better than I thought I would. You may get some songs stuck in your head!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|It was everything I thought it would be.  I really enjoyed listening to it.  I couldn't have been any better.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It took me approximately 6 months to try this game but now that I have, I'm addicted!!!!  I love the graphics and the challenges are hard.  This has become my FAVORITE GAME!!!  KUDOS to the designers.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|I don't watch TV these days, but when I do I expect to blown away.  American Horror Story did just that.  I'd heard a couple of people talking about how much they enjoyed it.  I dragged my heels about checking it out for myself and marathoned the first season this weekend. I could kick myself for waiting so long. Eerie, erotic, and entertaining.  The cast of characters is eclectic enough to work on so many levels.  It's not perfect, but I appreciate it all the same.  It reminds me of another series - American Gothic, that was cancelled way before it's time, and ironically enough, Sara Paulson, who plays the reporter Lana in Season 2 also had a major role in American Gothic as Merlyn, the dead sister of Caleb who appears to him after she has been killed by Caleb's father. Jessica Lang would be a good match for Gary Cole's Lucas Buck charater - both enjoyably evil. I'm a few episodes into the second season and even though the storyline is different, I'm still enjoying it.  Glad I checked it out, just in time for Halloween.  Can't wait to watch Season three.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|This album is almost Perfect! Every song in here is great (Except for Better Left Unsaid). Its an album that I can play all the way through, without skipping any songs. Great Job
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of my favorite games on my kindle fire. In this game you make a Dragon park, breed dragons, and keeps you occupied. This is one of those games where you don't get occupied for hrs but for several minutes and then come back, that's if you don't buy gems, money,or treats. Great game for all ages. I have my sis playing it and a few other friends playing it too. This game deserves 5 stars. Give it a shot
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have had no problems. I love that I can play with or without internet. Animation could be better tho!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is an awesome past time and plus some.  I have three coworkers and myself all stuck on this game.  Of coarse I'm always poor and don't have enough money half the time...but I love the app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is very good and logical. I have just one advice. If you are stuck just click everywhere and something is sure gonna come up. I only had to do it once. Looking forward to the expansion . . .
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Easy to use and fun haven't played to many times, but have won each time so not sure if it's being nice to me and then coming in for the kill. We will see!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Even those of us who have studied theology have something to learn from this book, which firmly places Jesus in his context and makes a pretty impressive argument for a less theological and more immediate and practical meaning of the Kingdom of God.
B004LUS390|5.0|App is very easy to use had a little bit of a hard time in the begging, then I watched the video on the app page and figured things out.  Still haven't drawn a master piece, but does help pass the time.
B008JFUNKU|3.0|I would give this film 5 stars for acting. Tom Hanks is excellent, particularly near the end of the film, where he gives another oscar-worthy performance.  I would give it at least 4 stars for screenplay.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'd have to give it 1 star (the minimum) for cinematography. Yes, we get it, the action takes place at sea and it's a very chaotic situation. But it was definitely overkill with the hand-held cameras. Continuous hand-held camera work might have been watchable if they had at least tried to keep the shots steady, but they obviously went out of their way to keep moving the camera around in nearly every hand-held shot, in some misguided effort towards verisimilitude. That, combined with the trendy post-MTV method of frequenting cutting to the next shot every two seconds, before the viewer can focus on the current shot, made the film literally unwatchable (although I stayed to the end for my companion's sake and tried to watch as much as I could.).<br /><br />Bottom line, I agree with Crosscut.com Seattle reviewer Rustin Thompson who said \\"Pass the dramamine\\" and \\"Tom Hanks needs to work with a better director.\\"<br /><br />With all the quality elements present, this could have been a truly great film, if the director had simply filmed the story, taking minimal care to make it watchable for the viewer, instead of trying so hard to be tricky with the camera work. An audience will generally accept the reality of the plot line, even without total authenticity, if not constantly distracted by the camera work. A few relatively cheap tripods would have made this film a classic. What a missed opportunity!
B002SJ2ZTK|4.0|The quality was pretty good for an old movie. I enjoyed this one because I had just seen the play.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Love it esp &quot;locations&quot;, but home screen widget local temp is STUCK on wrong temp!! Help! Hate that!! Looking for new app.
B00BMR4RIG|1.0|Never updates on its own, and you have to open the app to get it to update. Not good if you just want to glance at the top of the screen.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that it came to Kendall fire. I have so much fun. I like candy crush. Everyone who have a Kendall five like to play games must play candy crush.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|We love having the most recent season in our Supernatural collection.  Can't wait for the next season.  Sign us up.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars but for the lack of apps to use this with.  Once the SDK has been in the right hands for a while hopefully we'll see more things like an HBOGO app, Amazon and Hulu apps, etc... (iTunes app? well......maybe)<br /><br />As it stands right now I really dig the Netflix, Chrome and YouTube functionality and I use this thing almost every day.  Worth it.
B008JFUO72|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie.  Hard to believe that it was the 3rd in the series.  Just as good as the first.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|I bought the first fruit crush and beat the 100 levels and was looking for one that was just as fun and not so easy that it's not fun,, this is good for any age and has 3 levels of difficulties . I am 56 and I can see any age playing this,, you don't always get it on the first try even on the easy level,,, I just love this game,, hard to put down,, I have so many books to read on my kindle but now I have to put them on hold till I play a lot of this game,, This game is great. people have been buying candy crush,, but I recommend this and the first one.. so much fun, haven't played games in years and years now I am addicted to these... fun and requires some skills, you figure out what you did wrong when you don't complete that level, like making 3 of the ones that are not needed for that level, so the next time you can beat it , maybe.... highly recommend.... great for everyone...... if there is a 3rd one after I beat all these levels I will buy that too.... best game ever.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|This is one of my favorite cd's, I strongly recomend this CD if you have a nice headphones and a good amplifier with Bass EQ. The only bad is that eminem not uses his real voice, and I dont like the song chorus.<br /><br />P.D. : It would be wonderfull if this CD includes &#34;My darling&#34; and &#34;Careful what you wish for&#34; another two great songs.
B001EC2IT4|5.0|my daughter LOVES this movie and we all enjoy watching it together. a great family gathering. it is a great movie
B008Q08IV4|5.0|Timeless story of the power of love and the journey of a man discovering his life. Amazing sound track.<br />Brilliant!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was the perfect finally for this series. Don't want to spoil it or anything but I got a little teary eyed. People are saying they hate the ending and everything but the world of Divergent isn't meant to have a perfect ending. It wouldn't make sense if everyone lived happily every after. I loved it.
0131103628|5.0|Bought this book for a class.  It arrived earlier than expected and in better condition.  The book itself is also a very helpful reference guide for ANSI C.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Excellent love it ! Awesome ! Worth every minute !!enjoy watching every second ! Missing out if u don't watch every week
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story was good but not my favorite. I dropped it so many times because it couldn't hold my attention long enough.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Drop box is the best thing since sliced silicon. Easy to install and to use. It allows ease of transfer of photos, documents, virtually any data from one platform to another. Hard to imagine working without it.
B0044M3JVC|5.0|This album is in fine shape. The 3D-like performances on this is so much better than the Greatest Hits albums, in terms of realism and detail. A wonderful purchase !
B001AQR3JY|1.0|No comment other than I ordered it from a different on line shopping arena.  The movie itself is for my granddaughter and my own children watched it on vhs for years. Some parts are scary for the very young so they need to be warned beforehand.  But a Disney classic for sure.
B000000YIP|5.0|To think that the musicians stayed up all night to record this, with almost no rehearsal time, what a performance = WOW.
079284131X|5.0|Love this movie. So happy to add it back to my movie collection. Im such a fan of horror movies and I just love some Chucky. Thanks again for this movie.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Not a bad game but just not a game I like.  A friend recommended it.  If it what you like then it could be good for you.
B00902S0IS|5.0|Just love this movie, at the time this was one best SiFi movie. Remember going to the with my parents, a movie that had a very Hi-Tech for the time
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed this book and the story.  Do not read much of  this type of book.. Plt is pretty good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Well worth the wait.  Already tied into facebook and competing against friends.  Now I know what all the fuss was about.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is a heap of wicked, wacky fun, man! You look at this at first and think, oh this app is made of crap, but ignore that and play on! This game is not crap! Ignore the negative reviews and get it! THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! By the way, if you have heard of zach sobiech, you rock. If you havnt, look him up. He is my cousin and I miss him very much. He wrote the song clouds.
8496879542|5.0|THIS BOOKS SIMPLY ROCKS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO KNOW MORE ABOUT OZZY. ARRIVED INTACT TO MY OFFICE ADDRESS AND IN GOOD CONDITION
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|We have enjoyed watching it. My daughter is hooked on. She can hardly wait until the next episode to come out.
B009LDD1X0|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  I absolutely adored the first five seasons and the show could make me laugh so hard, if I'd been drinking milk, it would have come out of my nose on several occasions.<br /><br />Now I just believe the show's getting a little forced in them trying to make us believe they're all still those oddly endearing nerds that we felt sorry for.  &#34;Normalcy&#34; (for whatever that's worth, for really, what is normal?) is setting in for all these couples and I already have &#34;normal&#34; in my life.<br /><br />If the show goes off the air, I will miss Sheldon.  He will always be one of those iconic characters that will live in my head until my head stops working (kinda along the lines of Robin Williams and &#34;Mork&#34;).  You just had to love him.<br /><br />Still, even with the downhill slide after the peak of this show, it's still better than 3/4 of the shows out there.  I envy someone who's been off the grid for a lot of years and gets to watch them all in one big marathon.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This books was one of my favorite of all three books, yes the ending was a little hard to take, but what do you expect a cheesy ending made to make the reader happy and feeling it had to have a Cinderella ending. This was fantasy, but the reality of it is - and I don't want to spool the ending for anyone but Caleb was week and a coward. I really could not see him pulling off what needed to be done.  Actually I could not see anyone with the determination and skill set and mind set of pulling thru with mission that needed to happen, besides Tris or Tobias. To make it happen with any other person would have been more un-believable.  I would have like to have seen more of Tris and Tobias and have a happy ever after ending for them, but the world they lived in was not happy and it would take many generations to change that, so we would not see the truly happy ending, but the legacy that was made for Tris and the Thoughts and believes that were relayed were dead on.  I loved the ending and even cried some tears for Tobias and way to go Christine who really shown thru as a true friend. This is the life and legacy I would only wish would I could leave.<br /><br />I loved the authors message in all three books.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|The price was perfect!  The story is a tad hard to follow but it's good investigation for around three hours! I would buy it again!!  Good hidden objects games .
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I really like it, but it should include cable with differents end connectors, is very fast and practical, doesnt need many space to storage!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I don't like when I have a ton of extra moves, am playing on my phone or ipad and can't retrieve those moves.  When I play on the computer, none of those unused moves transfer to that desk top screen, therefore, I can't use those.  On the phone, the lives build up where as on the home computer, whether you accept or not.  If I astart afresh with a new set, great, but I can't get them after I pas the drop down for accepting.  By time I need them, they are gone and I've only played the full set by waiting....
B00005KAQP|5.0|An older movie but a really good one. Whoopi Goldberg has to hide out from the mob at a convent, a funny premise to begin with. But she finds a way to be useful by leading the choir, which sorely needed help. The church flourishes as a result and has a positive impact on the community. A fun movie to watch.
140006922X|4.0|bottom line similar to progressive christian theologans;ie, Borg and Funk with  different and significent goals of Christ along the way
6305433909|5.0|Whoopi Goldberg revives her role as Sister Mary Clarence and works with teens to encourage their talents. The movie is uplifting and full of great music.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It was 100% exciting fiction just for fun entertainment...funny at times mostly because it was so unrealistic and Hollywood....I really enjoyed it. I have liked all of the Iron Man movies and will see another if it come out.
B0010T0OCY|5.0|This is a great movie filmed in the tradition of film noir, great cast, and acting. Would recommend for those who enjoy sci-fi and noir.
1589795474|5.0|Having read the book about 10 years ago, I still remember sections of if quite vividly - and that, in my opinion, is the hallmark of a great book in and by itself. The book was eye-opening in many respects. The author had spent a great deal of time researching the millionaires of America and was thus able to give some excellent insights into who are the real millionaires. My take-away from the book was the fact that the truly rich are not the ones throwing around money and driving fancy cars. On the contrary, most of the time they are quite indistinguishable from your average neighbour. They drive an ordinary car, they live in an ordinary house and they have a mundane business. However these are key - they own their business and it is something decidedly unsexy like waste management or scrap metal. There are businesses where there is a lot of money to be made but that are not attractive to most people. The few who get into it, are not flashy by nature, don't mind getting their hands dirty - and can become very rich. I loved the book and if there is an updated version out there, I'll probably read it again some day.
B000069I1H|5.0|One of my favorite De Niro movies, he shows us a great sense of humor and genius comedic timing. Paired with Eddie Murphy, and a hilarious plot, this is a must see.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|About time I was expecting this game for months now and finally I get it thanks amazon for this game is totally awesome
B00005JKNC|5.0|A film that reflects idealism from the 1950's, a time when, following WWII, the nation was still in pain over the loss of so many family members, and needed healing. Jim Carrey plays a reluctant hero who confronts Congress over Hollywood blacklisting and attempts to violate the 1st Amendment. One of Carrey's best roles.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|The story is a great ending to the trilogy and nonstop action from beginning to end. Highly recommend this movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I am a big fan of Grisham's work, have read every one of his fiction novels, and purchase them on publishing date. Had this been any other author, it would likely have gotten a 4-star rating, but Grisham is better than this. It returns to his first main character, and to 1989. I forgot how much everyone smoked in 1989. I digress, which is what he does too much of in this offering. There are the usual twists and turns, which is good.<br /><br />BUT--a big but--there are so many side trails and needless forays into the lives of minor characters and random cousins, I pretty much forgot the foreshadowing about the big reveal at the end. Also, as a Stephen King fan, I am skilled at keeping track of seemingly minor random characters. There are many in this book that serve no purpose at all. By the end, I was very frustrated about that. (What's up with the Chicago cousin? COME ON editors!)<br /><br />It is worth a read, but don't expect to be blown away and thinking about it for a long time. This is a shame, because it deals with a part of our country's history that deserves to be explored but typically is not.
B00E9P957Q|5.0|I figure that people buying this will for the most part know what they're getting into...I own all of the albums in this compilation already, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that...but the packaging is very nice, and the remixed version of Vapor Trails specifically is better than I expected it to be.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Now time to watch the movies! Good series, crazy ending. The plot is a lot different then anything else I've read in a good way.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is the most powerful book with the best information that anyone could have.- Spectacular and truly life changing information.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome , Excellent, could not stop reading, fast paced page turner, can't wait to read the final book, mocking jay
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very fun but addicting, wish you didn't have to pay to get more lives or extras during the game, that part kids stinks.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Love a mystery. Fun, easy, relaxing to play.  What's more it is free. Should be able to buy more diamonds with coins though.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Wanted to know what all the hype was about so I downloaded this app. It's pretty entertaining. Worth trying out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|OMG! I loved it !!!!!!!! One problem though, they left  a lot out. Still the BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!! Now for book two!!!!!!!!!!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows.  It is too bad the collaboration between HBO and BBC did not last as long as it was supposed to.  The blu-rays look absolutely stunning and have great sound.  Season 1 is one of the best seasons of any show.  Season 2 could have been just as epic but since the studio knew that the show was not going to last the 5 seasons which it was supposed to they compressed a vast amount of time into the second season.  It is a real shame that its full potential was not realized.  That said it is still a great show to own, it is a great blend of historical events with lots of fluff.  If you like other HBO shows you will definitely like Rome whether or not if you are a history buff.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|To me I can't stand this game it is boring and annoying not  a fan at all don't get it :((
B004DSD6T2|5.0|Beautiful movie of a True story. this is an all time and beloved classic...a family movie. watch it often. excellent acting
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|good game. whole play area actually shows on my 3.5 android screen! Tried one from another site and it did not fit to my screen.
6304711905|3.0|Many people consider this to be one of the greatest westerns of all time. I personally disagree. I felt it was overlong and clunky in its storytelling. The &#34;romance&#34; side story with Kurt Russell was pedestrian and I got bored with it quickly. Val Kilmer was fun to watch, as was Michael Biehn.<br />In my opinion, Tombstone is an average western, and I'd rather watch Unforgiven or 3:10 to Yuma over this ANY day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Seems simple at first until you realize how you increase your points is by looking for the patterns of larger groups and finding ways to increase them or combine them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Very good book! I wasn't sure how good a sequel to &#34;The Shining&#34; would be, especially after so much time has passed since its publication.  But this one was well worth the wait. I highly recommend it.
B0039208JE|5.0|Based loosely on Frank Miller's vision of Gothham and the Dark knight ,a darker gritty place to be to live in a place in need of a savior. Plus who can top Keatons Batman and Nicholson Joker, nobody not Bale or Brownback Ledger.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Knew I needed to add this to my collection after seeing them play live in August. This isn't just some 80's band trying to make a come-back. Their music still holds its own.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This game actually msde me think a while and almost kicked my butt. Although it vwas a little too short for me.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Had no problems with this purchase or the movie!! I'll order from them again in a heartbeat!!<br />Great movie, I loved it!
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|Beautfiul story that slowly unfolds to reveal why the shy, nervous freshman, Charlie, is so withheld.  Through his association with the cool outsiders, Charlie finds himself.  I did not read the book, which I suspect is better, but still enjoyed this beautiful, moving, subtle production of Charlie's emergence from a trauma-based life.  The cast is fantastic.
B004EWFUQY|3.0|I am the kind of person who has tried every diet out there. It has never really worked in the long run, until i began a very protein heavy diet. The Dukan Diet was my stepping stone, and this book was the foundation. I went from 300 pounds to about 190 in about 6 months - including a break for my honeymoon. Clearly something in this book worked for me - but, I have come to know that that thing was my ability to modify the diet to my own needs. This review, then, is not about &#34;The Dukan Diet&#34;, but rather the book.<br /><br />When I say it is poorly written, I mean that in a few different ways:<br /><br />1. The book is clearly translated from another language (in this case french), and it is not done so very well. So, it is not always a fast and effortless read as it could be.<br /><br />2. The tone of the book is horrible. Essentially overweight people are called out for having no self control and frequently, as the reader, I sit back with the sense that Dr. Dukan thinks of overweight people as someone who needs a firm hand, which the approach and the tone of the book reflects.<br /><br />Within a few weeks of beginning the diet, I completely stopped consulting the book - it often made me feel bad even though I was actually losing weight rapidly. Instead, I used many of the ideas from the book and ate a very protein heavy diet. I helped myself to condiments that Dr. Dukan would have never approved of and I ate some vegetables that weren't on the approved list - but, they were vegetables nonetheless and not fries, rice or pasta. It meant being able to continue eating so much protein without carbohydrates - rather than quit out of frustration with the strict book, I took just a little bit longer, but actually kept going until I was done. Now, a year and a half after finishing the diet, I am keeping my weight.<br /><br />The best thing about the diet is that you are taught to eat smaller portions - I was hungry (like, REALLY HUNGRY) the first few days, but quickly started feeling full from much less food than usual. Today I could never eat the kind of portions I once did. I can't believe I ever could. The recipes in the book are poorly done - with a bit of imagination you can make better tasting food at a MUCH smaller price.<br /><br />If I had known these things before I read the book, I would have instead read about protein diets online and followed my own path. The book itself is not worth the money.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I get many hours of fun from this game.  I really like it. Easy to playon the kindle, especially since it sync's with my pc.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|Put this in a crummy 'getto blaster and you have a true flashback from 1972... made one take trips to Winterland at the Fillmore West... for the New Year's Shows.  Admittedly you have to have a taste for the Dead... Soooo Gooooood!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game but highly frusting and adictive at the same time.  I call it that d#@! game.  Wouldn't give it up ever.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This series was so great.... For the first two books. This third book is completely disjointed and doesn't follow the same writing style or character personalities or speech patterns. At 60% through the book, it does flow similar to the first books. The ending seems like a cop out.
B00ARW2XJW|3.0|I was looking for something to give me the inside air temp. This gives you the temp of the phone, which is always warmer.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|Got this specifically for my SGS4 phone. Without the case on my phone it barely fits making the extension bar bend backwards and afraid it might put too much stress on it so it will probably break soon. However once you get it in there its snug and will not be going anywhere. Most phones are smaller then the SGS4 by maybe a couple centimeters so as long as your phones width is not the same or bigger then the width of the Samsung Galaxy S4 then this should fit your phone. Otherwise I do not recommend it.<br /><br />Oh and the arm that extends upwards is spring loaded so it can be difficult to get a cell phone in there as big as the SGS4.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|I entered this film expecting total schlock and set to enjoy it.  What I found instead was a rather well-produced and intelligently-presented re-creation of Norwegian folk lore.  I Googled \\"trolls\\" following the film and it was surprising how closely they stuck to the lore.  The scenery is facinating, the CGI acceptable, the characters quirky enough to be fun. I wouldn't say this is a \\"must-watch\\"... but it's well worth watching.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|As someone who probably doesn't take advantage of all the apps that are available (not Gen Y!) I found this to be extremely easy and navigate.  I love it!  I bought my original Kindle when they first appeared and haven't looked back - one day I might even upgrade, but now I believe I don't need to - downloaded the Kindle for android (samsung tab 8.1) and it's simply fantastic.  I especially like the display, scrolling through the books using images of the actualy printed books is much more engaged (and fun dare I say it?) than the simple lists i have on my Kindle. I do believe this will be my new and ugraded Kindle for a little while yet. If you are wondering whether to or not, I'd say give it a go, you might be surprised.
B000P407K4|5.0|If anyone rates this under 5 stars it's simply a matter of personal taste or \\"not getting it\\"... or perhaps being of a younger generation that doesn't understand the nuclear cold war.<br /><br />Doctor Strangelove, an ex-Hitler associate, has defected. However, half of his body (subconsciously controlled) is still loyal to Hiter and keeps trying to murder his other half.  That's just the tip of the iceberg of this ultra-quirky film where Peter Sellers plays multiple parts.<br /><br />As good as he was, one has to wonder though whether it was Sellers, George C. Scott or Slim Pickins that pulled off the film.  These three were an excellent choice to play off one another's characters and were each responsible for helping to make this one of the most memorable satire films of all time.
B0073AHR2O|4.0|Worth a look if you want to know the military side of UFOs and the cover-ups the US Government has perpetuated for decades.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|did not get to make it to theatres & loved all the action in this flick. My favorite SOA actors made it a must see for me lol will be buying this movie!!
B000ID37RM|5.0|This story is timeless  How movies sd be made.  No blood n guts but the fear is always present.  Fear thru a child's eye
B006JPML7K|5.0|It's an awesome movie. I would recommend it for anyone who loves Kung fu. I totally love this movie it's amazing.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|A must have for any collector of the Walking Dead series.  The brothers united together in one great package.  The next series will feature Merle as a zombie so this will be a great feature for your collection.  Get it while they are available.
B008XCJ03K|4.0|I had not heard their music before until his hit on the radio. I admit I am hooked now and will continue to look and purchase more of their  music in the future.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great family movie! Definely a must watch for a family. Great story line too. Beautiful movie all together. I recommend it
1452126577|5.0|I love grumpy cat and I love her book. Just a fun book that I bought to go along with all my other cat books on my coffee table.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is a fun film if you enjoy gritty action movies like Die Hard, Predator and others in the same vein.  This has a great simple story. Bad guys do bad things and Dredd has to fix it. Sure there are other characters and developments that make this a more complex story, but the core is the rookie's first day and how bad it can get. Karl Urban is a fan of the comics and the character of Dredd and it shines through his performance. I can't give this movie enough five stars. Just watch it if you are a fan of action.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|So this is just awesome.. I've got one of the other sets.. and this is just the coolest thing ever!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Can not get enough of this....<br />Have to play at least twice a day. I have a sweet tooth, it's all so addictive
B00005R5G9|3.0|I have this movie and viewed it and it is a bit goofy in parts but I still like it.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Thank you for the good read and free book. I enjoy this author and will look for more of her books.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This is worth buying. I watched all of the movies and my favorites is Alien & Aliens.. I like the other ones too but like the first two best..
B007S3S8HO|5.0|Very good game. I ordered a Christmas gift for the child. He knows the game from the Internet. He likes to play with her.
B000A2UBN4|5.0|Is a very good movie. De Niro is great in this role.. He's scary & crazy... I would watch this movie over and over!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone the enjoys drama and suspense. I can't wait to seee the next episode of this show.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I though it would work on all sites on Chrome . It does not !  Save your money for something more usefull..
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I loved this game so much! I got this app for free app of the day, but even if I had to pay it would've been worth it. You get to go through all these castles, and you have to use rocks or bombs to destroy lights hanging on the walls so you don't go into the light. Sometimes I get stuck more than I thought I would before, some levels are hard, so I'd save up your &quot;solutions&quot;  (solutions are hints to finish the level)
B00G32OER4|4.0|This was one of the better horror films we have watched in a long time. It definitely gave you the &#34;chills&#34; a few times while watching it. We were really impressed at the fact that there was very little gore and can't remember any foul language used in the film. I would highly recommend watching this one if you are a fan of good horror movies.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|trying to log in to face book and it wont let me log in and then freezes and cant do any thing
1451695195|5.0|An excellent book to recommend to all friends of like mind or similar .It is a well detailed account  of a professional .
006202406X|5.0|The 3rd in the series is awesome, told from both Tris and Tobias' perspectives as the reader finally figures out what their world is and what their very natures mean.
1848507836|5.0|Not quite finished but better than expected - An excellent rating for my review - can not wait to finish - probably tonight .
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Very much like. Except moving cue into position takes a little to much time othet than that it's coo. Try it you'll like it
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|.This game is absolutely awesome. I love it. It is soo fun. You have to get this game.I love the lamborghinis.
0205191584|5.0|All college students should READ this book. I recommend it to my management and business students, too. My author-pop keeps a copy on his desk next to his computer monitor, as do I now. If you watch &#34;My Cousin Vinny&#34;, a copy of this book is on the lower shelf of the judge's table beside his chair when Vinny enters the judge's office for the time. (Hey, the judge character has a law diploma on his wall from one of the ivy league schools....)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you've read The Shining, not just watched the movie, then you are in for an exiting ride that you thought had ended when the Overlook boiler exploded. Doctor Sleep is the story of adult Danny Torrance. Where he's been, what he's been up to, and what happens next. In the best Stephen King tradition, you'll be enmeshed right from the start.  I read The Shining a few months ago for the first time, and like most of King's stories, the characters never quite left me. To find Danny again (Dan now) was a both a joy and a curse.  As the song says, &#34;a little sleep is all we're losing&#34;. But you expect that when the author is Stephen King.  The characters are addicting, the story consumes you, and the premise is both frightening and eerily plausible. I recommend Doctor Sleep to everyone who has ever enjoyed the genre - you're in for a treat.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A little more in depth and more challenging than what I'm used to playing, but I like it-good game difficulty level is a challenge- the only downside is when I run out of energy.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It completely lacks a text-to-speech feature and will not allow one to be used for the books. There is no work-around other than stripping the DRM from the books and using a different app to read them.<br /><br />Do not purchase kindle books if you want text-to-speech and do not own a Kindle tablet.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|Once again Steven King starts down a road with no destination. His 'evil' seem to be taken form elements from the movies (Lord of the Rings, Who Framed Roger Rabbit). If you have a sequel in hand ,give your readers something to appreciate. The climactic ending is too pedestrian.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is very eye-opening and somewhat disturbing. While everyone may not agree with Dr. Perlmutter's findings, everyone should be given the opportunity to learn of his findings and apply his suggestions as they see fit. Great and understandable reading for a &#34;scientific&#34; book.
0316228583|4.0|Loved that J. K. Rowling chose to write an adult book, although many of us enjoy the Harry Potter books as much as the children did.  It was a fascinating read and I look forward to more from this author!
1444777556|5.0|I ordered this book as a gift for my sister Cathy Letourneau, who is ill, I hope the book can be delivered so that my sister is able to enjoy the book, I am very disappointed in the Book Depository and Amazon, never again.<br />Sheila Thorne
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|As an educator I appreciate the multifaceted approach t o teaching that this app has. I recommend this highly, especially as a way to study  white taking a class or preparing to travel.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Five stars<br /><br />I rated it five stars because I love Greek stuff<br />I dislike nothing<br />I would recommend this to greek (mythology) lovers
B00CWY76CC|5.0|NICE APP WITH PLENTY OF CHALLENGE. AND FUN. A NICE MIX WITHOUT. BEING. TOO EASY OR TOO DIFFICULT Can't. wait. FOR MORE LEVELS!
B00FF8OKJE|3.0|This game is a really good game, but it updates about once a week and is sometimes down for more than a day until the update us available. You cannot get unto the game while it is updating. It's so frustrating.
B00FVS4EUI|5.0|You can't go wrong with the walking dead. Each season gets better and better. Looking forward to the 3rd season 2nd episode.
006202406X|5.0|Everyone is bashing this book for one reason or another. But what people are missing is that it is pretty much impossible to review only Allegiant; you need to review how the booked ended while taking into consideration the entire trilogy. The entire series is beautifully written, and while the ending of this last one definitely came as a shock, it was the perfect ending for this series. SPOILER ALERT: Tris dies showing each quality that she had an aptitude for.  I would expect nothing less of Tris, and Veronica Roth. I would have been extremely disappointed if the series ended with everything going as planned, THAT would have been boring... which this ending certainly is not.<br />As for the people calling this book &#34;monotonous&#34;..... that is just completely false. So very false. If this book was written anything less than amazingly there would not be such a high amount of people upset by the ending. The fact that people are talking so much about how it ends makes it an amazing ending and an amazing book for that matter. Also to those of you who are calling it monotonous, you finished it quite quickly for a book you found so boring.<br />So everyone please, if you haven't read this book, or the series, READ THEM. NOW. They are wonderful books and Veronica is most definitely a wonderful author.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was very impressed and pleased with this book. If you are a sci fi fan then I'd say this is a must read. My only hope is that they don't ruin a great book with the upcoming movie.
B003VANOFY|3.0|had some problems getting it to co operate with my computer, but when I finally got it to work it was really nice without the restrictions of the cord. I use Teamspeak and I had to set it to -20db so it didn't pick up background audio, it doesn't really have a &#34;noise-cancelation mic&#34; but still worth the pick up since you can turn it into one.
0385351399|1.0|I preordered the book based on the author's previous writing. He has been a favorite of mine since his first book. I did not realize it was science fiction. It was the most tedious, repetitive, writing I have ever read. The Circle reminded me somewhat of Scientology. The book definitely had a message-big brother is watching you, but it was done in such a boring way that I started skipping through it half way through. I learned to never preorder a book again.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I had high hopes for this based on the number of good reviews, but yikes. This story has been done so many times and there was nothing special or new here. Accidentally/On purpose (?) married. They don't want to like it. One side or both want to stay married thinking the other doesn't. Something happens that makes one side or the other run away. He goes and gets her. They come together and realize they really do love each other and live happily ever after. I skimmed through the last half of the book just to see if anything happened other than what I figured happened and it didn't. Cannot recommend. Unless you like the same Harlequin formula done over and over again don't bother.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|While it might not be quite as good as his other offerings, it's still very worthy.  Gladwell's knack for telling a story and using real life examples to support his points is on display here as it usually is.  Some of his conclusions might be a bit 'reaching' at times, but overall its an enjoyable and interesting read.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A bright, large display (kindle fire) very nice!  I use it often.  Great for any math needs, beats a conventional calculator.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Very interesting book, great pacing with vivid images.<br />I recommend this to readers of any age, and hope the movie will do it justice.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|How to explain the exquisite beauty of this novel about a girl in WW2 Germany?  Well , it is about love, the power of words both written and spoken, hatred, war, family, friendship, life and death.  Read this book and  it will snatch you up and take you away, and you will never forget it.
006202406X|3.0|While I  really want to give this book one star it does deserve  more. I really do think it was a good book, I've just spent the last year and a half waiting for this book, to be completely blindsided by the ending.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Not done yet but so far so good.  Have enjoyed them all so far. Looking forward to the next one.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|We watch this one over and over again. Acting, story line....everything is top-notch. The race scenes are incredible, too. Almost as if you're on the in-field!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Honestly I bought it to keep my Collection of the Franchise up to date.  I didn't think I was going to like it but I was pleasantly surprised.  Having Khan actually be a villain on one hand and yet adding a touch of humanity to his act of terror was a great twist.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|Great movie just as good as when I saw it years ago when it first came out. Interesting to see the actors so young.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Cute and very family friendly, fun for parents to watch also. Funny and has a good story line. Would recommend for family movie night!
B00BTHV05M|4.0|Great lyrics and beat. Talented group. They are definitely a new and different sound which differentiates them from other relatively new groups.
B00A285OOW|3.0|A good read that expands on the mystery surrounding the two princes - too bad that we can never know the whole truth, but this interpretation is both plausible and intriguing.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love exactly WHAT IT DOES. I dont expect much out of a $35 device. I dont demand it go all out. It meets my expectations: Playing youtube from my phone. That's all I need or want it to do and it does it fine. I like that if I play to chromecast, my Sony TV will automatically switch inputs to the Chromecast. Don't know if that's a chromecast thing or a Sony thing.
