B0017VG69U|5.0|We got these DVD's because my children heard us talking about what a great show it was. We knew that for the most part, the content was appropriate to watch with them, and they really love the show and find the different personalities really funny and interesting!  Now they are asking for the next season!

B003L77GH4|5.0|This was a bargain on Black Friday at $12.99.  It was on my daughter's wish list so with the free shipping it was a great deal.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I purchased this product before I saw the movie because I love Hawaiian music and I am thrilled with this CD.  Old time classic, \\"Hi'ilawe\\", by both Gabby and Sonny are fantastic.  Keola Beamer is wonderful as is Jeff Peterson.  I'm ready to see the movie again just for the music!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game ie pretty good.  I play it a lot to pass the time.  it is pretty fun.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book hooked me on the first page.  Then I absolutely could not put it down.  This is the first book that I have read in a long time that would keep me reading all night!!!  After I finished it, I absolutely HAD to purchase Books 2 and 3 for my Kindle.  The movie is coming out in theaters next week, and I feel that I MUST finish  this trilogy before seeing it.  The Hunger Games hooked me faster than The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo trilogy.  Although Katliss, the protagonist in The Hunger Games, is the complete opposite of Lisbeth Salander, she does portray the same courage, strength of character, and determination.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This is the best movie so far in this series.  I'm looking forward to part 2 coming out later this year.

B004TI5N38|2.0|I expected more after having read other Baldacci novels but Zero Day was a waste of time. Baldacci sure has his ups and downs. This was a 'down'. Seems this was a rapidly written formula thriller that is lacking in thrills. I honestly saw exactly how this would end ...  I almost pre-wrote the final dialoque in my mind. YOU can do better DB!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Every time a new John Grisham comes out-I am so EXCITED!!!!  I love trying to match wits and see if I can figure the end(before I get to it).  Still trying!!
0439023491|5.0|First off I loved the first book and I finally got my hands on catching fire and finished it in less than a day.<br /><br />when I started reading it I had to admit I was a little skeptical of where the plot was headed but in the end the slightly slower or less action packed beginning opens up to a much bigger plot. this book is a little bit more political than the hunger games was but I loved it and I'm super excited to read the third book now!
B000X107GI|4.0|Very inexpensive batteries. Good replacement batteries for the AppleTV remote. What can you say about batteries? It has been 3 months and still going.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|I purchased this book because the description sounded different, and I love espionage mysteries. I almost quit reading in the Prologue, because as at least one other reviewer noted, the writing was just not that good. However, I stuck with it (I'd paid 12.99 after all) and after the third chapter or so, the writing improved. This is quite a surprise because usually writers, editors, and publishers focus on getting the first three chapters polished the most. I suspect that either the publisher or editor requested that the prologue be moved from a later chapter at the last minute and the writer didn't have time to really polish it.<br /><br />Anyway, I found it worth my perseverance.<br /><br />Negatives: the narrative really, really jumps around from the present to different times in the past, and those jumps aren't always identified clearly enough for the reader. I believe that the tense used in some chapters/sections is just wrong. The writer should have done everything in past tense except the prologue and sections that are happening \\"now\\".<br /><br />Positives: a different type of story, with twists and turns. The author provides enough clues so that the reader can solve the mysteries, which I always love. The jumping around in time, which needed some polishing, did provide the suspense by revealing the story in carefully allotted increments.<br /><br />This is definitely worth a read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|While playing the best puzzle game around, you will enjoy the calm music of a piano and cello. This game is more than worth the .25 you pay for it.

B004EPZ08E|1.0|Please note that if you buy your disc here at Amazon - the special features and the DVD/Ultraviolet Digital Copy are NOT included in the package.<br /><br />The true blu ray Inappropriate Edition package is THREE discs, not just one.  What you buy here ONLY has the Inappropriate Edition blu ray disc - That's It.  After returning mine and going to eBay; I was able to re-purchase the complete set for $16.95.  It included the aforementioned blu ray disc, the Theatrical Version blu ray disc (this is the one with all the special features advertised inappropriately -no pun intended- here) AND the DVD/Ultraviolet Digital copy disc; all as initially intended by the packaging.  I just took another look at eBay.  There are many listings selling the one-disc version, but there are other sellers offering the manufacturer's actual 3-disc package.

0061969656|3.0|Bernard Cornwell is great at what he does, which is write manly historical military fiction.  Each of his heroes is a tough SOB who lives through and often becomes the deciding factor in a series of famous historical battles.  Lord Uhtred, the hero of the Saxon tales, is cut from the same cloth as other Cornwell protagonists, like [[ASIN:0140294295 Richard Sharpe]], [[ASIN:0312156960 Derfel]], [[ASIN:0060935766 Thomas of Hookton]], and [[ASIN:0060934611 Nathaniel Starbuck]].  Although he sees himself as a Danish warlord, Uhtred has sworn to defend King Alfred and his people from the encroaching Danes, and lives through the historical events of Ninth and Tenth Century Britain.<br /><br />This is the sixth book in the series, and while it has the usual components -- pitched shield-wall battles, gritty middle ages romance, daring raids, and the like -- and while those components are done well, I couldn't get excited about the book.  The key elements are Alfred's apparently impending death and the struggle to identify the next king of Wessex, but none of those drive the plot forward much.  As a result, this feels like it's mostly arranging the characters for the battles to come, together with some repeats of earlier action.<br /><br />Cornwell's most famous hero, Richard Sharpe, got away with twenty-plus books because almost every book had a new conflict for Sharpe, plus a vividly characterized villain.  Death of Kings is lacking both of those -- both the Danish and the Saxon antagonists are forgettable in this book, and even the battles are over quickly.  I'll stick with the series, and suspect that there is great stuff to come, but will probably have trouble remembering this one by the time the next novel comes out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A really good read. It has the page turning goodness of something more lightweight like the Hunger Games but with a rich societal structure with plenty of surprises as the story progresses.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|Bought this for my 25 yr old son and he just told<br />me that the tiles are warping even though he has<br />stored them in their box.<br />He loves the game just says his friends older version<br />is much sturdier.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a great way to read the Bible.  I use it every day to read through the scriptures.  The different versions also help in my understanding of the meaning of the text.
0439023513|3.0|Just finished reading the last book in the Hunger Games series. I am giving this novel 3 stars for the following reasons...<br /><br />While the writing is excellent and each book is riveting, I can't help but feel disappointed that the author dedicated 1000+ pages (in 3 novels) to violence and the oppressive aura of the Panem world where the characters lived, but could not pull in one final chapter that gave the reader hope.  There was barely a glimpse of the better future that Katniss, Peeta, Haymich, Gale, Finnick and the others fought so long and hard to secure.  It was added in as an afterthought in an epilogue that was barely a page and a half long.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more balance between the violence that permeates all 3 novels and some periods of respite.  Those only came as the characters were unconscious or asleep.  It occurred to me that I find it somewhat disturbing that Ms Collins can write untold chapters describing the most gruesome tortures in graphic detail but not be able to find a few paragraphs within her writing soul that develop the bonds, friendships and relationships beyond the \\"arena\\" that were such a vital part of the story and the eventual outcome.<br /><br />For example ... Katniss' mother seemed to be totally forgotten by midway through book 3 and just faded into the background.  Katniss was left to fend for herself.  What mother would abandon her child - even a young adult child knowing how much pain she had been through?  Lastly, the relationship with Peeta was not explored at all after the rescue and with how the 2 had parted in the Capitol it was a bit far fetched that they would suddenly meet up again and everything would be rosy and fine which is what war alluded to in the Epilogue.<br /><br />As this novel was targeted to a late teen audience I think the violent content is a bit over the top and am having second thoughts about giving it to my 15 year old granddaughter to read.<br /><br />Pity really, because I greatly admire Ms Collins' ability to write so well in the first person, it is not an easy task.  I will see the movie, mainly because I am curious to see how the story is translated to the screen.e I greatly admire Ms Collins' ability to write so well in the first person, it is not an easy task.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|My husband and I both enjoyed reading this book. We were impressed with the author's unique style of writing. The story was interesting and emotional.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Can a propensity towards violence be passed down generation to generation?  Is there a so-called \\"Murder Gene?\\"<br /><br />Newton, MA District Attorney Andy Barber seeks to find the murderer of his son's classmate, and the tables are turned when his son Jacob is accused [given the title, this is hardly a spoiler].<br /><br />Elegantly crafted, DEFENDING JACOB, alternates between a first-person account by Barber and transcripts of Grand Jury testimony.<br /><br />It's an utterly bleak story that makes for compulsive reading.  The characters pop off the pages.  The plot burns with white knuckle intensity.<br /><br />It's the most sure-handed of William Landay's three novels.  And it's a definite 5 Star treat for crime fiction junkies.
B00273D43S|5.0|A very best remater cd from Japan, re-release 2009 remaster. The cd was made into mini lp cd slip cover look like a album.  It limited once its gone its hard to find. The sound is very awesome Japan cds always have good sounds.

B002V092M4|5.0|Truly a great book to read! Really gripping story.<br />BUT don't expect gore and dead bodies and Rambo-style hero.<br />This book is a little more sofisticated than that.
B00164CM46|5.0|Love this movie.  Not sure that it was necessary to get it on Blu-ray as it's not a very visual movie, but worth it!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie and are a fan of Guy Ritchie's movie making style, do yourself a favor and give this a watch!  It starts off fast and pretty much doesn't let you catch your breath.  Hilarious movie.  Thanks so much Mr. Ritchie!!!  Now give us RockNRolla 2!  :o)
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I recently bought Dr Quinn Medicine woman. The last time i watched it i was 6 and it was spectacular then, and now ... Even more so. This series is amazing and it has so much detail. when one looks back at old stories you see the terrible quality of the picture and bad acting. This is not the case. We are watching it on our HDTV and the image is perfect.<br /><br />I would tell everyone to get it as i enjoy it very much and understand what is going on now, compared to the 6 year old me!<br /><br />Seller is amazing! received my package befor ethe expected delivery date! its wonderful!
1451648537|5.0|I believe this book has changed my life.<br /><br />In the lowest ratings of this book the reviewers are saying that this book didn't provide more insight into the mind of Steve Jobs besides illustrating endless anecdotes of jobs being a jerk.<br /><br />I don't think this book was intended to be on 'how to be as awesome as Steve jobs and build a billion dollar company'. Although honestly, I do think he provided all the basic values anyone would need to have to do just that. They just missed them.<br /><br />Jobs said \\"Your already naked, there's no reason not to follow your heart\\" and with the last sentence of this book I realized what that really means.<br /><br />Those two things make this book worth every hour spent reading it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Great value for the money. Protects the Kindle around the house or in my backpack. An inexpensive way to preserve my Fire.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this version...so much fun to play...Love the characters.. very similar to the movie...Love that you have to try to free the birds from the airplane.
B0041KKYBA|3.0|Good detail of many events leading up to financial failures.  This will get people interested.  There is an opportunity to build on this data by first of all, summarizing the key points (a summary is lost due to the large amount of data given) and there is a real opportunity to develop more detailed proposals to carry on from where we are now.  For example; its easy to say we 'need more regulations' but that leaves the participant 'cold'.  A follow up to this video would identify specific things to do to counter the negatives already identified.  Its one thing to find fault, its another to offer real solutionsl to pursue.  This is real hard work, I realize.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really loved this book! I got through it so quickly & thought it was a great way to end a great series!
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you liked the season when it was broadcast you will love it on Blu-ray.  The story is even more epic when watching and hearing the details that were missed during the live air broadcast of the show.  If you have a home theater this set will truly be brought to life.  Right from the get go, when the Nights Watchmen are waiting for the iron gate to clear their path through the \\"below\\", you will literally \\"Feel\\" the gate opening.  The images are so vivid and the landscape is so beautiful, you can almost reach out and touch the fog.  This was a great series on TV and even better on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Bottom line, if your wondering if what Blu-ray has to offer over the original on air HD viewing of this series, wonder no more, it is simply Amazing.  Sound 5 Star, Video 5 Star, Epic couch 'potatoing' 5 Stars.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|As good as its reputation promised, and an excellent representation of classic science fiction (as opposed to Space Fantasy). My only disappointment is that the later books fail to recapture the initial promise of this book...
0385344228|5.0|The plot moved quickly through a litany of problem areas encountered in today's society; bullying, uninvolved parents, professionals that follow cultural norms in a checklist format rather than simply chilling out and savoring life for its simplicity.  The dialog is troubling in that many of the problems encountered by this family, and others, could have been prevented if priorities were committed to significant things in life.  Perhaps, I am over simplifying things but I don't think so.  The ending was so sad.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|Bought this DVD for my girlfriend on Valentine's Day. She loved it. The product came on time with no issues.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works well on the kindle fire. I will have to use it more, but what I have done is great.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Drive is one of the most badass movies I have ever seen. The cinematography is outstanding. It has a sort of Miami Vice/Scarface feel with an '80s Miami feel to the soundtrack. The story is crazy and totally unexpected. Solid cast, makes Ryan Gosling look like a man finally. The indie feel makes the movie amazing even if you end up not liking the storyline itself. Definitely a must watch.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Product arrived well before time quoted and in excellent condtion. I was a little apprehensive to order used dvd's, but am very pleased with what I received. No problems with any of the discs and will defintely order from this seller again!

B0015DROBO|5.0|such a wonderful read. Kept me on edge until the end. I was begging for more. The trilogy that Stieg Larrson created were my favorite reads in a long time. I could hardly wait for the next one to arrive. I do think the \\"Tattoo\\" was my favorite. He had the magic touch in making us want more after each book. The interaction between Lizbeth and Michael Kept us hoping for more.  I just loved them all and it is so sad we had to lose this facinating author.
0307956350|5.0|This was an excellent read.  It held my attention from the very beginning and continued to until the very end.<br />Mystery and twists throughout the entire book and many surprises when you think you can predict what's coming.<br /><br />I'm planning to share this book with a close friend who is an avid reader.  I know she'll enjoy it as much as I did.<br />Great style and plot.<br />Recommend to anyone who enjoys a good, but realistic thriller.
B005B0QYMM|3.0|Periodically, I get a hankering for scary movies. Tonight, at the local rental store, I found Grave Encounters.<br /><br />When I rent movies, I take my iPhone and scan the bar code. It takes me to Amazon where I check two things: (a) the rating, and (b) the customer comments. I don't usually rent movies below 3.5 stars. Four is my gold standard. Three stars is a risk that, admittedly, occasionally pays off. But my sweet spot is four stars.<br /><br />Grave Encounters was a solidly rated movie so I thought I'd take a chance.<br /><br />The opening was beyond cheesy. The jittery, jerky hand-held camera work was making me ill. I kept thinking, \\"These are supposed to be documentary film makers who shoot reality TV shows and they can't even hold a camera steady for three seconds?\\"<br /><br />For the record, I abhor jittery, quick-cut movies. I've walked out of them at the theater, and I've avoided seeing them once I read reviews about them. Such camera work is the sign of a director painfully low on talent, and even more bereft of ideas. Often, that kind of camera work is a failed attempt to hide a bad story, or bad acting, or both.<br /><br />So I was worried when Grave Encounters began and all I saw was an attempt to look edgy and \\"real.\\"<br /><br />Eventually, once the actors got inside the mental institution, it got better. The camera work wasn't as nauseating and the movie finally kicked into gear.<br /><br />The old mental institution was truly creepy. It, alone, was worth seeing. But what could have been a very, very unsettling movie deteriorated into parody by people who kept splitting up into excursions, alone, into dark places. Like when they sent the equipment guy to gather up all the static cameras. Really? They're trying to get out of a scary situation and they send the guy to take down and bring back all the cameras placed throughout the hospital? Seriously?<br /><br />Needless to say, that guy disappeared.<br /><br />The acting - especially by the Goth chick - was pretty bad. I never once bought that she was anything more than an actor trying to look scared. She was nice to look at. But she added nothing to the movie.<br /><br />Then the \\"monsters\\" came out. And they were pretty hokey. There wasn't really an explanation as to why the ghosts of dead mental patients would become monsters with unhinged mouths and a desire to kill. But there they were.<br /><br />This movie could have been a home run. It was an interesting premise. But the execution was flawed.<br /><br />I recommend Grave Encounters, but with reservations. I thought it was okay. Nothing great.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|From page 1 this book had me. A Ghostbusters quote right out of the gate was the herald of the wonderful journey through a fascinating story that is loaded with 70's and 80's geek nostalgia. A truly geektastic read that I could put down. Highly recommended!!
0143119680|5.0|A Discovery of Witches---what a perfect novel.  Really.  It was.  It easily could have been too long, too slow, too detailed, too poorly edited, too full of itself (these were the complaints I'd read about before starting, that made me nervous to begin the book, and even made me go into it with a negative judgment)--it wasn't any of those things.  It was perfect.  And Lovely.<br />The entire time felt like being wrapped in a warm blanket and loosing yourself to a different existence.  I found the whole experience comforting, which is strange considering the book contains torture, some death, the verge of war, etc., etc., etc.  Harkness does such a beautiful job!  I was interested in the story the entire time (even when they were just discussing wine--which I don't even like--she used the conversations as tool to better discovery aspects of the characters.  I cared about the characters, even the main ones!--typically I fall more in love with the supporting characters than the main, here I loved them all.  I appreciated the romance in its simplicity and lack of constant overt sexual description--I'm not a prude by any means, but sometimes the incessant sex can be distracting from the story.  Her creativity was brilliant.  To be presented with so many new thoughts and original ideas in this genre when all I read is fantasy is a phenomenal experience.  As for those who compare it to the twilight series... get a grip.  The comparisons end at both novels having a vampire in them.<br />For me, this novel was a masterpiece.  I hated when the book was finished.  I wanted to stay submersed permanently.  Can't wait to go back in the second installment!

0756686970|5.0|My six year old son saw this book before Christmas, and I was excited to find it at a savings of about $6 on Amazon. Since receiving it as a Christmas gift, the book has kept him enthralled and amazed and continues to do so almost three months later. He spends lots of time looking at the pictures and reading the details and comes away with new information he enjoys sharing every time. It has him hooked now on Legos and Star Wars. It is definitely his most frequently used book. It even helped him learn how to use a Table of Contents. Older members of the family have enjoyed browsing through it, too. I would definitely recommend it!

B004UA8D2S|5.0|This movie is great. after reading a bunch of bad comments, i thought to my self is this a good movie or not, then i said lets find out, and the results were AWESOME, i think many people did not like it because they thought there were going to be some monsters or creatures down the cave, if you guys expected that go watch decent 1 & 2 this is a really good movie although the speech was not movie type, but the movie over all was great my family and i, we all liked it, my father is one of those people  who are very hard to like a movie and sleep in the middle of it. And i was watching him while the movie and his eyes were wide open, and very into it. Any ways this movie is good and the cool this is that i have prime membership and sometimes i get promotions and i got this movie for 1.99 Blu-ray that was awesome and I am very happy to add this movie to my collection. also tis movie was no directed by James Cameron, do not judge by the cover. read what he is, and James Cameron is the greatest director of all times, he owns the title of the best movies of all. they putted his mane on the cover to attract peoples attention. but if you read carefully he did not directed it.

B004Y6MU6S|5.0|\\"Elantris\\" was the first Brandon Sanderson book I ever read and I thought it was very good, so I thought I would give the \\"Mistborn\\" Trilogy a go; and the \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy did not disappoint, it was fantastic. So I said to myself this Brandon Sanderson guy is really good, and his \\"Mistborn\\" series is so good that he couldn't ever top that; so I went into \\"The Way of Kings\\" with reserved expectation, but from the first page-to-the last , I was left utterly speechless and amazed.<br /><br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" is now one of my favorite books of all times, and 1008 pages weren't long enough; I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />I have to admit that I checked this book out at my local library because I didn't think it could be as good as the \\"Mistborn\\" series, and it's rare of me to want to read something more than once, but I simply had to own a copy of this book for myself so I could read it at a more leisurely pace.<br /><br />One of the things I love about Mr. Sanderon's books are his heroes are people of sound character and high morals; characters that we can look up to and inspire us.  Some might criticize Mr. Sanderson for this, saying it's highly improbable that such people with such high morals could really exist, but that's why they call it fiction. Like I said, I want heroes that inspire; I want stories that take me away from a hard, and sometimes, cruel reality we live in; to give me a break and visit a place where good triumphs over evil.  Honestly, I don't want to read about villains/anti-heroes walking the gray line between good and evil; if I wanted that I would just follow politics.<br /><br />\\"The Way of Kings\\" has it all: Action/fantasy/adventure, philosophy, theology, and tackles some very profound questions.  It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you sometimes mad, and sometimes sad...it will inspire you...Simply put: It will cover the entire emotional spectrum.<br /><br />This book will stick with you long after the final page.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one in the series.  Brandon Sanderson delivers again.age.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one in the series.  Brandon Sanderson delivers again.
B0034G4P4Y|1.0|Lest one thinks the stars for this review refer to the movie itself, I offer consolation; the movie is wonderful and should be enjoyed by as many people as possible, especially after its woefully under-attended performance at the domestic box office. Seriously--buy it, watch it, love it for years. It's an amazing adventure.<br /><br />My review is for Amazon's product description, which seems to be a cut-and-paste from the movie's press release. I'm glad to know it's on 2 discs. Huzzah. But what is on those two discs? Should I rely on the thumbnail picture of the back of the box to inform myself? This has been a real problem with Amazon DVD/Blu-Ray descriptions lately; I had to return a purchase because the description on the page was completely misleading.<br /><br />I know Amazon is a big company, but I'd imagine the studios releasing these movies to Amazon would be quite upset if they knew people were mightily confused when trying to simply learn what they're getting on a DVD/Blu-Ray when they intend to buy it from the internet's leading retailer. Get on it, Amazon.
B006ZCWTZG|5.0|I have been a Springsteen fan since \\"Born To Run\\" I have most of his Albums. I have not always liked everything he has done. I was wondering how this album would be without Clarence. Bruce had just one song where the sax was very evident. This was a fitting tribute to his former sax player and friend. What did not expect was the way he used other horn style instruments instead. And I must say they sounded good. This album was a little different. If your a Springsteen fan you should enjoy. If your not a fan check it out you may like!
B007JRU2UK|4.0|George Clooney and Supporting Cast members provided a quite exceptional performance.  This movie provides a fascinating look into a family's conflicting  struggle.  Quaintly interesting from the beginning to the end.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is very well written. Once the momentum gets going, it is hard to put it down. When you finish it, you will want to buy the next two!!!
B005I3PAUO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. David Baldacci creates very interesting characters that you just need to get to know. Interesting plot - not one I've read in a bunch of other books already so that was a refreshing change.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Listen yal,  this is the best game i ever got , if u do not like the game,  u r missing out on all the fun.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was skeptical about this app, but when I found out how much you can do, including emailing items and saving to Google  Docs or DropBox, I was sold. It would be easier to use if I had an attachable keyboard, though.
B005KAJPY2|5.0|The album has a consistent theme different from the last album. Each song is individual unto it's own. I can tell that much passion and hard work was put behind the creating and shaping of this album. Gratitude is my favorite. The lyrics are uplifting and profound and ring true to anyone who has suffered hardships and come out stronger and wiser in the end. Enjoy this album more and more each time you listen to it!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|My son played a similar game on the PC from hoodamath.com called red remover.  With the touch screen and sensitivity of this game on a tablet, it becomes much more fun.  I had to download it myself so I could beat all the levels!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST APP AVAILABLE. AND ITS FREE. Once I figured out how to download my choice of Bible onto my Kindle Fire tablet and was able to pull it up in church without wifi, I was extremely happy.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very fun........once you start playing you can't stop. I'm not a big game player but this just gets you hooked.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Ignore the critics! Good advice at any time but particularly worthwhile in regards to this film! JOHN CARTER is the following:<br /><br />1. A strong character-based adventure story<br />2. Exciting<br />3. Romantic<br />4. Humorous<br />5. Wildly Imaginative<br />6. Visually astonishing (sets, costumes, props, architecture, vfx, animation etc.)<br />7. Epic in scope<br /><br />If you enjoy any of the above, See This Movie!<br /><br />To non-fans of the originals: you don't need to know *anything* about the books to enjoy this movie, it's great for anyone!<br /><br />To fans of the originals: this is actually more faithful than the Jackson \\"Rings\\" trilogy. It is absolutely steeped in Burroughs. Stanton has managed to make a film that is 90% straight from the original texts but in a way that anyone can enjoy.<br /><br />In summation: John Carter is an instant classic, go see it ASAP!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I ordered the 10th Doctor Who's Sonic Screwdriver, however I was sent the 11th. I'm not let down because the 11th is my second choice. But when I contacted the seller on returns/exchange so I can gift the right screwdriver to a huge Doctor Who fan, I did not receive a reply and was forced to gift the wrong toy. I would have liked some sort of reply, but I was not.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Terrific CD.  I think most women can relate to the lyrics of these heart-felt songs.  There is a good reason why Adele has won so many recent awards for her singing and song writing.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Just a few days ago my friend was telling me about fun. and I had absolutely no idea who they were.  Of course, like most people I recognized the clip of 'We are Young' from the recent Super Bowl commercial but I had never taken the time to find out who the band was.  To say this band is 'fun' is definitely true but not near enough.  They are refreshing to listen too.  It's always a rarity when you can start an album at the beginning and just let it play.  I'm instantly a fan.
0312641893|4.0|Put this book on your shopping list for Christmas 2012, don't get it now. Book 2 (of 4) is not scheduled to be out until 2013. The Kindle version of this book should be cheaper by Christmas and the next book will be out a few months later. The next book is supposed to be based on Little Red Riding Hood, Scarlett, but if the story of Cinder is not continued in the next book, the Lunar Chronicles will die before Rapunzel and Snow White get their book deals.  It was a great book, but as a librarian I do not plan on recommending it this 2011-2012 school year because 2013 is just too long to make a teen-aged girl wait for closure which, unfortunately, may not occur until book 4 in what, 2015, 2016 or later? The girls who think this book is so great now will be off in college by then & not as interested in young adult fiction or reading for that matter. JK Rowling started with book 1 in '98 and 4 was published in '00. She didn't start taking 2 years to get the next book out until she had already established a base, which were younger readers than what this series is aimed at. You better step it up Ms. Meyer & Feiwel Pub. Co. if you really want to sell a lot of books.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I bought this book when I saw the movie trailer based on the book.  It looked really good, so I wanted to read the book first for obvious reasons.  The book was incredible. It gave an insight on part of the history of WW2 that I didn't know anything about.  The research on the history seems very accurate.  I loved the way the reader learned the mysteries of the event as the main character learned them.  I became very involved in the book and wanted to do further research on that time period and event.<br /><br />After reading the book, I watched the movie, which followed the book very closely.  Of course, as usual, the book was much better than the movie.  So don't cheat yourself, read the book!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I found this to be great game for all people young and old. I loved it and so did my sister
B004EYT932|3.0|I found this book quite hard work - it's jam packed with relevant facts and figures but the read did not flow for me. It may be because I read the Kindle version and I think it's harder to absorb fine detail from the smaller screen. I saw myself back at economics lectures as I went through the book, which probably reminded me why I didn't want to become an economist.
0062082353|5.0|Amazing account of one man's determination and will to serve his country, family and his team. Chris Kyle is an exceptional American. Absolutely outstanding!
B0060AY6FO|3.0|I'm a great fan of both Jane Austen and P.D. James.  It was daring of James to attempt adding to \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" and in many ways--especially at the beginning of \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\"--she captured the spirit of Austen and even the language and customs.  However, as she moved more deeply into the murder mystery she strayed farther from the essence of the characters as shaped by Austen.  In the end, neither Austen nor James come off being purely themselves.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Born to run was a fantastic book. It has inspired me in my recovery from hip surgery and I have begun my journey of barefoot running since reading the book and doing some research.<br />Looking forward to the release of the movie!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have been using this for only a few days, but it seems real solid and I use the Bluetooth in my car and stream it through the stereo. Now when my Sirius trial is over I can still get good streaming music  : )
B004YEJGEO|4.0|Hopefully this will get fixed soon (ASUS TF101), would be a shame not to play again. and more words for the stupid word counter
1612130283|1.0|This book so poorly written and more moronic than erotic. I bought it because of all the hype about how it adds spice to women's lives. Really? If you want to read a well written e-book involving 20 somethings, try All the Bride's Men, by Lauren Frasca. It's not erotic, just a good romantic and fun read.
B005BDZN62|5.0|One of the best musical of all time, and I'm glad to report that fixed BD - with the corrected opening transition, already started shipping by AMAZON! Just received my copy, with the new UPC barcode #8 83904 24523 0 82, pasted over the BD case. Both picture and sound are great! Go get it!
B000YI7MRM|3.0|The reviewers have correctly agreed that it was a mistake to cram five books into one long movie.  Too much of substance and pleasure to the reader is left out.  The whole comes off as if it were \\"made for TV.\\"  Perhaps it was.  The books are wonderful and exciting however, and this movie is good enough of a first pass to earn another stab at it by a superior production.  I think however that Viggo will not be bested by any other.  An actor of his caliber is needed for the cryptic and laconic Alatriste.<br /><br />On the plus side, the sets and scenery and costumes are fantastically real.  No doubt when they were filming in the Palacio Real in Madrid-- they were there.  If not then I am most surprised.  The harquebuses, the swords, the perpetual presence of the main gauche blade-- all were required and all were present.<br /><br />I only have modest Spanish so we used the English subtitles.  The subtitles were sufficient.  They lack the poetry of the English translation of these books, which have a fine style all in themselves; and yet they were adequate.  They coincided well with the content and listening to the movie in Spanish is absolutely pleasurable and should be mandatory for the viewer.  I loathe dubbing and this was mercifully not available.<br /><br />Viggo was the best actor, as one might expect. The rest of the cast were fit and capable insofar as the abbreviated story structure allowed them to unfold.  Unfortunately that was not as much as a reader of the series would desire.  All in all then, unsatisfactory to a reader of the series but good enough to enjoy and wish for more.  Another pass is highly desired!
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This app exceeds my expectations. I love it.<br />I used it on my Asus Eee Pad. When I gave it enough light, the app and the camera of the tablet worked together and produced excellent results.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Fun and addictive. Great puzzles Hard to put down. If you enjoy remove the red you will love this game.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|just the right amount of challenge to inspire rather than frustrate. perfect at end of day. beautiful yet simple graphics.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I really expected this book to hold a lot of merit as everyone I know has praised it as being a classic must-read work of elevated science fiction. It's really just about the dullest novel I've ever had to endure. Don't believe the hype. This book was juvenile and bland in both content and execution.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game for passing time and seeing how many points you can get, and it looks great on the kindle fire!
B0067Q04AM|5.0|Outstanding.  Having been an avid Glasper listener since 2006, I was inexplicably reluctant to jump on this offering despite the hype. In retrospect I was struggling to categorize Glasper beyond young jazz giant - a condition Black Radio is specifically designed to deconstruct.  My musical tastes are highly eclectic so I have to admit I was surprised at my early reluctance.  Much has already been written about the gifted musical talents guesting with the Experiment and it's all true.  The craftsmanship is simply astonishing as is the creativity.  The verbal chiding we receive for having been musically dumbed down is admittedly self indulgent, but I suppose it's been festering for quite a while and needed the outlet.  Fine, as long as Black Radio follows, I will endure the unnecessary chiding. For what RG has done here is nothing short of a game changer- a clarion call to musicians to create their unconstrained best.  All I can say is 'thank you' and 'yes, we are listening'.  Album of The Year contender without question.

B0072X2O66|1.0|After following MP through his career with Dream Theater and through various side projects, I stumbled onto this the other day and I was initially speechless. This is, without a doubt, probably the single worst project to ever Mike Portnoy and Russel Allen's name on it. Words just can not describe the unoriginality of the music combined with some of the most generic and uninspired lyrics I've ever heard. Now there are a few tolerable songs here and there scattered throughout the album, but they become unlistenable once you get to the pathetic excuse for a guitar solo. All the guitar solos, courtesy of Mike Orlando, are undistinguishable for each other.<br /><br />Rating: 0.5/10
B003UESJIS|4.0|Another Year is a remarkable drama about a family and one lonely person who happens to be a family friend. It spans across four seasons of a year and at no point did it seem too eager to please the viewer on irony. I noticed there was very little background music that somehow seemed to accentuate the whole subject matter of the film and the conversations contained within. However, now and then, especially at the start and the end of the film it broke into this classical music which was truly heart rendering. The characters are all ORDINARY save none. Yet this film is a distant spectacle that somehow stands out without any meandering and minimalistic editorial ushering. The characters are so real and the effect is sedated. This featured on many \\"best films of the year\\" lists and I now understand why. Strongly recommended for the curious.
B004EPZ0AM|4.0|I just saw this movie and enjoyed myself.  It was fun, not oscar material but fun.  That's all I expect out of a movie.

1846612934|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1JRVNT754LC7S]]<br />FOR THE PRACTITIONER - THE TOOLS YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH COMMUNITY CARE LAW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Providing community care services to the public by local authorities and the responsibilities that go with that obligation is a complex and diverse subject; so diverse that the barrister or solicitor advising on such matters is faced with a formidable task.<br /><br />According to author, Jonathan Butler, an acknowledged specialist in this area, community care law has been described variously by judges with words like `piecemeal', `labyrinthine' and `exceptionally tortuous.'  Fortunately for lawyers and non-lawyers alike who are charged with understanding or advising in this often fraught area of law, the `Community Care Law and Local Authority Handbook' has just been published by Jordans in a second edition.<br /><br />The book is certainly a boon to busy barristers, not to mention social and health care professionals.  Here, in one handy and portable volume of over five-hundred pages, all the diverse statutory materials that go to make up the legal framework are brought together. Also included are such materials as Local Authority Circulars and extracts form leading judgments.<br /><br />Among a host of topics, this indispensible handbook provides detailed coverage of  the law and practice relating to disabled and vulnerable adults and  children, capacity... accommodation...finance and charging... mental health... community care... and health and social care.<br /><br />New material in this second edition includes two new chapters on Social Housing and Asylum Support.  All this is supported by expert commentary on, for example, the way in which the various statutes interrelate and how they have been interpreted by the courts.<br /><br />Also new: the major changes in respect of `Capacity and the Court of Protection', including recent case law.  The Mental Health chapter deals with the new code of Practice and there is a Capacity chapter which examines Deprivation of Liberty.<br /><br />So, as a guide through what has been referred to as `the legislative maze' of community law, the book works superlatively well!  With research resources that include tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments and logically laid out and detailed table of contents and index, it's not too likely that you won't be able to find whatever you want to know.<br /><br />We like Butler's quote from Dr. Johnson (as reported by Boswell) in the preface: `Knowledge is of two kinds:  we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it'.  If you seek information or insight from within the tangled web of community law, this book is where you know you can find it.  The law is stated as at December 2011.al Health chapter deals with the new code of Practice and there is a Capacity chapter which examines Deprivation of Liberty.<br /><br />So, as a guide through what has been referred to as `the legislative maze' of community law, the book works superlatively well!

0812548094|3.0|The plot was good. My biggest problem is the constant misspellings. I am a good reader and read about one book per week. This book had a lot of \\"that\\" when they meant \\"than\\". Also there were a lot of mix ups between \\"they\\" and \\"then\\". As a good reader I substituted to keep the meaning, but a poor reader would get lost in the incorrect words. It looks like someone did a find and replace and replaced more words than they expected. Because of the constant wrong words I had to rate it a three. Maybe someone will fix it soon. Because the wrong words are actually words themselves, it won't word to do a spell check. It will take some proofreading.
B000H1RFKU|2.0|I saw this movie on tv once. My sister-in-law kept asking questions about it. Mostly my answer was just \\"It's his training day\\", as if repeating this helped answer the question of what was going on. I also speak louder to deaf people so they can hear me. The movie was bleh. Denzel Washington has one of the most symmetrical faces in Hollywood.

1594202842|5.0|I bought this book nearly a year ago, hoping that I would be shocked.<br /><br />This book, however, didn't scare me one bit. I grew up with a Filipino mom, which may be the only mother more fearsome than a tiger mother. You see, not only do Filipino mothers force you to be number one in everything you do, they're also extremely religious, so they always have the \\"be good or you're going to hell thing\\" hanging over you, in a frightening tiger mom sort of way.<br /><br />So, a mother telling a child she's worthless? That's child's play. Threatening to burn stuffed animals? My mother took my american girl dolls and put them in a box and threatened to give them to charity if I didn't clean my room. But with time and acculturation, my mother eventually calmed down. Thanks to a delinquent older sister, who is much like Lulu from the book (my sister is graduating medical school and was awarded a 5 year urology fellowship), I was often left to my own devices and was subsequently let off the hook, as far as my musical and academic responsibilities were concerned.<br /><br />Instead of reliving the horror of my traumatic childhood with my own tiger mom, I found this book extremely touching. Every Asian parent needs to give this book to their child. Sometimes, when we're growing up with this type of parenting and treatment, we don't ever understand why our parents treat us this way or expect these things out of us. When I was a young girl and teenager, i thought it was because my mother never cared for me, and truly believed I was stupid, selfish, and inadequate. After reading this book, i realize how much she loves me; everything she did for me, carting me to and from dance lessons, piano lessons, choir practice, and everything else. When she would expect so much from me and berate me for not trying hard enough, it wasn't because she thought I was capable of nothing, it was because she knew I could do anything, and was trying to push me so that I could see that too.<br /><br/>Anyone who doesn't see that, who chastises Ms. Chua for being too harsh, and not thinking about her children's self esteem did not get the point. A mother who truly loves her children mold them into the greatest person they can be, not leave them to the elements of nature to slowly erode them into an unidentifiable shape, which may be good or bad. Yes, she may be tough, but her daughter is at Harvard. Her other daughter is ranked 8th in the state in tennis, and in the top 1000 in the country. Instead of having shattered self esteem and blaming their mother for failures, they both have the confidence and work ethic to do whatever they like, and they have their amazing mother to thank.<br /><br />Read this book. I hope you love it as much as I did. Some think this woman pushed her kids too hard. I find myself wishing my mother pushed me harder, after reading this book.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|As a big fan of the books I was looking forward to the TV series ever since I heard there would be one. Since I dont have HBO I had to wait for the DVD release, it was well worth the wait!<br /><br />Since the books are so epic in scale I was a bit worried about the suitability of this series for a movie/TV adaptation. However, it all worked out great. Sure, there are differences with the book; some characters looked or acted slightly different than I had imagined them, some scenery was different than imagined, and of course a lot of information that you get from reading about what characters think has to be transferred to the viewer in a different way. These things always happen when a book is translated to a different medium, the directors cannot hope to match everyone's imagination. These differences were never disturbing to me.<br /><br />Ive finished watching the whole season in just a couple of days and Im looking forward to the next season.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|With every page turned--not literal since I read it on a Kindle ;-) I learned more about myself than with any other book.  I'm almost sixty years old and would never have described myself as an introvert until now.  I know I was painfully shy as a child and even as a young adult.  I was accused of being a snob in high school and college classes because I quietly took it all in without much comment.  I struggled with an \\"inferiority complex\\" even though I got good grades because I felt I didn't fit in.  I was late to date and was teased for being a \\"brainy snob\\". I prefer time by myself over time with other people.  I have a sign over my computer that says \\"It's not that I don't like people, I just don't want to be around them.\\"  I've had to make myself into a fake extrovert because it's expected.  I prefer email over the phone for communication and I hate texting and cell phones.  I don't paste my life history on Facebook because even that is too \\"out there\\".  I work for a retail company in sales who's philosophy is \\"a smile is part of your uniform\\" and \\"you have to like people to work here\\", but I've joked that the smile is part of the fake uniform I put on to go to work and you don't really have to like people, you just have to act like you like them!  Even people who know me well joke that I have a persona that I put on to be accepted when I have to speak in public or when I'm evaluated by being observed.  I've hated brainstorming since the word was invented and much prefer to come up with ideas on my own.  I actually left a good job because teamwork was so stressed over individuality that I couldn't do my job and I couldn't take it anymore.  I've joked that I want to be a hermit when I retire (only half joking).  I'm already a partial hermit: I live in a state with a sparse population, on a private road with no houses close to me and don't want to know my neighbors.  I have a few close friends and some work acquaintances but my social world is small and I like it that way.  I've always felt I can be alone without being lonely.  My God, I'm an introvert!!!  I feel better now, just knowing.t that way.  I've always felt I can be alone without being lonely.  My God, I'm an introvert!!!  I feel better now, just knowing.
0439023483|1.0|Well I guess we have to have trends.We are done with Harry Potter. When wil people (young people especially ) start reading books that are not all the rage.So many authors out there with great books to read.Horrible book and story.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|I was full of anticipation for this film, but was disappointed to a certain degree. Though it does have many good qualities and I enjoyed some of it, I felt the filmmakers took out much of the warmth of the story and focused too much on the cool high-action effects they could incorporate. It distracted from the magic this story could have woven, and I can imagine much of it actually being scary to kids--who I thought were the intended audience.<br />Also, again...with what looked like the intent to appear \\"cool\\", rather then genuine, Christmas town looked cold & industrial, rather then enchanting. I don't think these people get what childhood is about...It felt like creating something wonderful for kids was not their focus, but rather all of their their special new software and equipment they got to tryout.

B001HN6922|4.0|I had been waiting and waiting to see this movie for quite some time, so when I got it I had a lot of hope that it would live up the hype.  It lived up to all the hype thouroughly.  This installment of Cars centers more around Mater than Lightning McQueen, which to me is a lot better.  Mater stumbles into the middle of an international spy investigation while trying to help Lightning win a multicontinent racing series.  Of course, Mater gets into all sorts of trouble, makes a lot of mistakes, creates a lot of comedy, but ultimately saves the day.  The movie has a lot of eliments of James Bond in it, and the detail put into it is a exceptional as always.<br /><br />Was this as good as the first one?  No, but that's pretty hard to do.  Was there a pretty blatent message against large oil corporations throughout the movie?  Yes, but it doesn't ruin the movie.  Kids won't get it, and it's not so overly distracting that adults can't enjoy the movie either.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Great movie.  The cast was amazing.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  We will most likely rent it again.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Overall great example of the classics game. Clean, straight-foward, and very simple. Anyone and everyone can play and enjoy, also a simple time killer no matter whether you are on the go or at home.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Wow - this movie is great!<br /><br />If you like Army of Darkness, Shaun of the Dead, or any other horror-comedy movie in that vein, you'll love this movie.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|As a fitting 100 year anniversary homage to Edgar Rice Burrough's first hero and heroine, before Tarzan, Disney delivers with the big bucks, special effects and adventure fantasy, although Hollywoodish, that can appeal to longsuffering fans, old and new.<br /><br />I grew up reading this fantastic series and eventually all of ERB's books.  I believe this screenplay works off the set of the first three books, originally written as serials: A Princess of Mars, The Gods of Mars and Warlord of Mars. Let me just say that although this movie is a different story than the books, it stays pretty faithful to the original elements and characters.<br /><br />The title John Carter of Mars was the 11th book of the series.  No biggie, one needs the name.  But here the hero, unlike the solid Virginia gentleman of the book, carrys a nightmarish back story, and overall, he's in it just for the gold.  Typical Hollywood.  Where the moviemakers redeem themselves are in the effects, the great visuals of Mars, and the fun characterizations.<br /><br />The actors are well chosen.  Willem Dafoe is the voice of the savage but noble Thark, Tars Tarkas.  They include a cute but ferocious and fast, Woola, Carter's Martian 'dog' or calot; they show Carter struggle, like Toby Maguire in Spiderman, with his new found leaping ablilites on Mars; the Princess is beautiful, exotic but willing and wanting to fight.  Like the novels, there's an uncertain romance in the air.<br /><br />My favorite scene, as in the books, is when John Carter is fighting the massive hordes coming down against him, jumping and leaping, sword flashing with faithful Woola at his side, slicing the enemy in such great numbers that the bodies pile up into ever growing mounds of dead flesh.  Sounds more gruesome than it is shown on screen.<br /><br />The movie's a visual feast, and for those of us who have waited for decades for the film to be made, and made extremely, high budget and all, well, I am overjoyed and totally willing to overlook the changes in story.  The heart of Edgar Rice Burrough's beloved Mars beats red as ever, and we can only hope for more.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I first read this 'story' when it was released as fan-fiction based on Bella & Edward in the Twilight series.  It was difficult to get through,and I can't see how having it published through regular channels made a whit of difference.  There are wholesale passages that duplicate the free fiction.  I don't understand how the writer can take characters from another author's intellectual property and re-create them according to her own wishes. Ms. James should be ashamed of her theft and mis-management. These aren't classic characters, but current ones in the media's eye.  If I were the author of Twilight I'd be appalled.  And it isn't as if the re-imagining of the two were good.  Oh, no.  The dialog is stilted and the repeated phrases drove me nuts.  I say save your money for an original, well-written work.
0671646788|5.0|This book, \\"The Magic of Thinking Big\\", has been around for decades.  Many sales organization use this book as a primer to think big and achieve those lofty goals.<br /><br />A common problem today is either thinking too small or thinking too big.  Thinking too big can be an asset- if we take steps to achieve those goals.  Thinking too small is always a liability.  We should, and could, expand our mental horizons.<br /><br />This book is like a manual for your mind.  Our minds are designed to think big- rather than just barely thinking (or worse, not even thinking).  Reading books like this is one of the first steps to change your life to the better.<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons from a Mother\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoyed playing this app a lot. It was like nonstop fun.there were so many games to choose from. I definitely recommend it.
0061743526|5.0|When I was in high school, many of the English classes had this book as required reading.  For some reason, my English class did not cover this book in their curriculum.<br /><br />I read this book later in life (after college, etc.).  Harper Lee wrote a book that is not only interesting in its topic but her style of writing is concise- yet very clear and descriptive.  \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a great book for anyone to read- but I wish I read this book when I was in high school (or even younger).  Why is that the case?  Because I got more appreciation of literature and have looked at other classics such as \\"Intruder in the Dust\\", \\"Catch 22\\", \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", etc.<br /><br />Reading and writing are skills that need to be refined and worked on regular- more so than computer skills.<br /><br />One book that is essential reading- \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\".<br /><br />JR Felisilda<br />Author of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\"

The anti-theft doesnt work, but that's not the apps fault; its just a Kindle Fire limitation.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I loved the fact that my HTC EVO was able to download the Kindle App.  I love books, but to save shelf space, I was tempted by the thought of having an IPad or Nook.  However, I have kids and didn't want another thing to have to tote around, not to mention worry about breaking.  When I discovered my phone was all set up for it, plus it is smaller than an IPad, I was hooked!  It's really easy to pick books, since the library is extensive, and many of them are free, especially if you enjoy classics.  As long as your phone has the memory, you can download a few at a time, and then pitch the ones you're finished with.<br />Thanks Amazon for making the digital book experience so easy, and, honestly, so affordable!

B0014E9188|5.0|Once again I am blown away by the brilliance of Porcupine Tree. I purchased the DVD when it came out eager to see the band perform the songs I love. The performance was flawless! The arrangement, cinematography, visual effects, music production and overall presentation was nothing less than I would expect from anything Steven Wilson has his hand in creating!!! I never tire I watching the DVD! HOWEVER, There is ONE thing wrong with this DVD......It Ends!
1419702238|5.0|Bought it for my grandson. It came promptly and is in great condition. He likes it.He has read others in that collection and really enjoys them. He is 15 years old.
B00006IU73|5.0|'In Absentia' Is a perfect example of what  true musical genius is! Steven Wilson and the band are both masterfully creative and technically perfect, which creates music that NEVER gets old and always seems to sound or feel a bit different each time I listen to the album. It is brilliantly produced, which only further enhances the amazing music written and performed on this album. The only problem with this album, or any of Porcupine Tree or Steven Wilson's music is that it does not appeal to, how should I say this, ....STUPID PEOPLE. OK, that does mean mean stupid because you disagree with my taste, BUT, I have come to notice over all my many years as a Porcupine Tree fan that there are some common 'traits' amongst the listeners. One person put it as 'Mensa Metal', which refers to the group MENSA that is for those people who have a tested IQ at or above 98% of the rest of the population and Metal as a simple way to refer to Rock. Oddly enough, I was a MENSA member, I just applied on a dare and qualified, then left, who wants to sit around with people who are only together because they all have higher IQs than everyone else? Not Me, But I digress... Porcupine Tree fans share a type of intelligence which allows us to understand the complexity, difficulty and genius of the music we hear. It is not for the casual music listener who likes an instant 'hook', a 'catchy' beat, etc... Porcupine Tree's music, does have it's own type of hook and once it catches you you will never be loose!

B005VTS4EY|3.0|I would rate this a 5 for gameplay, but a 1 for longevity. Only 3-5 of the 100 levels were challenging (in that they took more than a couple tries to figure out) and the whole game lasted me probably a half hour.<br /><br />Fun distraction, but probably not worth even the 99 cents.
B005U3V7MC|2.0|I was so disappointed with this book. Long, long, long. It never seemed to go anywhere. The heroine is wishy washy and too nice and Darcy seems to be a bit of a woos! I didn't actually finish it.  Very hard to take a story that has already been written and re do it ? All her other books are so wonderful. I think she needs to stick to her own ideas. I understand what she was trying to do but I don't feel it worked.

0553378384|4.0|Jan Spiller's insight into the nodes and their meanings is spot on, in my opinion.  As an (admitted) amateur who has studied astrology for 20 years, I hold this book with higher regard than Martin Schulman's as far as accuracy is concerned.<br /><br />I am not rubbed the wrong way by Spiller's interpretations because I've come to understand that the north node details areas of WORK that must be done during this lifetime.  It is not meant to be flattering or soft-pedaled; it is truly constructive criticism to me.<br /><br />The slight adjustment I refer to comes in how you determine what placement to read.  In my studies, I've been fortunate enough to come across a method (not sure I can mention the internet source in this review) of interpretation that advises, amongst other things, that you take the house placement of your north node and use the sign that traditionally RULES that house as your node placement.  For example, if your NN is in the sixth house under the sign of Pisces, do not read \\"North Node in Pisces\\".  Instead, read \\"North Node in Virgo\\".  Once I followed this adjustment for myself and my family, Spiller's information became so much more valuable... it was uncanny!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King takes a pretty basic premise and really creates an alternate reality. I loved going back and forth in time, and how King is so adept at painting a vivid picture of the present and past.  I could almost taste that ice cold root beer from 1958!  If you are looking for a scare or trying to conjure up some nightmares, this book won't give you that... but if you are looking for a well-written tale with fleshed out characters, good storytelling, plot twists, and a little macabre, 11/22/63 is the book for you!

B0029LHX1W|4.0|The first chapter starts with a pair of starving children in a Russian village in the 1930s, hunting a scrawny, skeletal cat, possibly the last surviving creature on four legs in the region. Catching it may be life or death for them, and I was hooked right from the start. Child 44 is a brutal book, despite a relative lack of gore. It's actually not the rampant starvation and devastation of World War II framing the hard early lives of the characters that make the book most brutal, nor is it the child serial killer who is the central MacGuffin of the book. It's the pervasive, arbitrary, boot-in-the-face totalitarianism of the Soviet police state that makes every single encounter a life-or-death exercise in paranoia.<br /><br />After the prologue, Child 44 jumps ahead to the early 1950s, while Stalin's pogroms are still machine-gunning away. The protagonist is Leo Demidov, a war hero and State Security officer. At the beginning of the book, his life is about as cushy as life can get for anyone in the USSR who isn't a high-ranking Communist Party member: he has power, authority, a beautiful wife, a nice apartment, and he's been able to make sure his parents are comfortable.<br /><br />When the son of one of his coworkers is killed, Leo is told that the boy was killed by a train. It was an accident. He will inform the boy's family that it was an accident. The boy was killed by a train. The boy was emphatically &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> murdered, &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> found naked with his mouth stuffed with dirt, and &lt;strong>not&lt;/strong> seen being led from the train tracks by a strange man. This is the state's official line, and therefore it is what Leo is to believe.<br /><br />When more children are found murdered, the state says they are all separate, unrelated incidents. Leo, who has been a true supporter of the state his entire life, starts to find the cognitive dissonance too much to bear. Leo also has a problem saying things he knows to be untrue, like when his loyalty is tested when he is told his wife is a foreign agent and must be denounced.<br /><br />Pretty quickly, Leo's comfortable life goes to hell, and he is given a humiliating demotion. He and his wife are spared from the gulags only by the fortuitous death of Stalin. But even in a nowhere town in the Urals, Leo finds that the child-killer is leaving corpses, all over the country.<br /><br />Child 44 was a gritty, thrilling story, as much about the horror of living in a police state where reality is what the state says it is and everyone measures what they will say and do according to what they think will keep them alive, never according to what might happen to be the truth, as it is about a serial killer preying on children in Stalin's Russia. Leo is an interesting protagonist: not precisely a \\"good\\" man but neither is he an evil one. He's been willing to work within the system his entire life, until the system turns against him, and then he has a sort of awakening of the conscience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's at this point where I felt the story veered a bit away from its solid beginnings. Having stacked the deck so thoroughly against Leo and made it clear just how overwhelmingly powerful the government is and how no one can be trusted, giving Leo the ability to continue what amounts to an independent investigation without being caught requires one lucky break after another, and the lucky breaks just keep piling up. People with no reason to trust him or help him do, his wife who hates him suddenly becomes his most loyal ally, and he slips out of one trap after another. No single escape was unbelievable, but by the end of the book I was thinking Leo Demidov is one lucky Russian SOB. On top of this were piled some equally fantastic coincidences that constituted the surprise twists.<br /><br />It was still a thrilling story with very interesting characters in what felt like a historically accurate setting, but I had to knock it down to 4 stars because of how much bending and stretching the plot had to do to allow an unlikely maverick protagonist to survive in the USSR. That said, I recommend it to anyone who likes mystery/thrillers and finds the premise interesting. This is the first book in a trilogy, and I'll certainly check out the next two books.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook version, and I'm of two minds about the narration. The narrator was very good and gave each character a believable Russian accent. Therein lies the problem: these are Russian characters speaking Russian, so obviously &lt;em>they don't have accents&lt;/em>. But this reading did bring to life the plodding, implacable mood of the setting and the Russians who inhabit it. I suspect to a Russian speaker it would be a different experience, and reading the book (unless you mentally give Russian characters Russian accents as you read) would also give it a different atmosphere.ing and stretching the plot had to do to allow an unlikely maverick protagonist to survive in the USSR.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was truly an excellent book--probably the best \\"science fiction\\" I've read in over a year.  What makes this \\"science fiction\\" so engaging is that it portrays a possible (but depressing) future.  This could easily become a movie, and there's plenty of material for future books.  Kudos to the author, well done!  I won't give any spoilers, but I kept thinking to myself ...\\"why aren't there elevators?\\"  As the books reach their conclusion does the answer start to unravel.  A very chilling--but not too alien a \\"world\\" is finely wrought for the reader.  Again, this is a very good book.  Highly recommended.

B0072X2O66|3.0|I have been hearing tracks from this album for months now on XM, and was very intriged and waiting for it to come out.  Now that it is here, I must say, it is a solid rock album, but just does not separate out from other rock albums out there for me.  Many of the songs are not really catchy with riffs and the overall melodies that do come through do not stick for me.  This album indicates to me that the sum off all the parts separately do not add up to the greatness each part brings to it.  The songs that just really let me down and lowered me to 3 stars were \\"Undaunted\\" which really seemed like an uninspired angry teen rock song, something done before, and the song \\"Feelin Me\\", sounds like it was written in 5 minutes total on the back of a napkin right before they went into the studio. The lyrics are a joke on that song.  However, Mike Portnoy (Drums) and Russell Allen (vocals), and Mike Orlando (guitar) sound like they really had fun doing this album, and playing music and an album like this (much like Avenged Sevenfold for Portnoy) is probably relaxing for them, allowing them to blow off steam , enjoy themselves, and still make some people happy for the money they pay to see and listen to this album. Overall, that's what counts about music. They likely didn't worry so much about the technical aspects of the music like they do on their other projects.  It is solid musicianship on all parts, but again, just lacking for me in the end.  Do not expect a Symphony X or Dream Theater sound from this.  Does have a flavor of Stuck Mojo/ Nu Metal attitude, likely from Rich Ward's early involvement.  He has since been replaced with John Moyer of Disturbed.  This album, should all the players keep this project going, should get better with each album, so I recommend keeping an eye on them. As for this album, preview it and possibly borrow it to listen to before buying, may not be what you are looking for. This likely would impact me more if I had seen them live before hand, and saw how it sounded that way. Its flow sounds like it really could get a live crowd's adrenaline flowing.

The love the way the characters are developed through the story. I can really understand the internal struggles of the characters. I wish I could always come across books this good.  The two books are a bit long for some readers, but I could not put it down.  I would suggest only reading this book if you have enough time available.  I can't wait to read more by Patrick Rothfuss.

B0063GORYU|5.0|This Spider game is so much fun and clears my mind so I can get back to work. Easy to find on Amazon apps.
B005V1WZ10|3.0|I remember listening to Korn for the first time in 2000. Follow The Leader was what crossed my path and I loved and understood it. Issues was great, and Untouchables turned out to be my favorite Korn album of all. After Take a look in the mirror however, I lost track of Korn.<br /><br />I was listening to the radio back in late 2011 and heard about Korn coming out with a new album, The Path of Totality. So I went and got it.<br />The Path of Totality is certainly different from the Korn I'm used too. The Korn I heard when I was 16 is not the Korn I'm hearing now at age 26. But it isn't bad....<br /><br />Some songs like \\"Illuminati\\" \\"Way Too Far\\" and \\"Sanctuary\\" just didn't connect with me. I had to give this album a few listens. Then I discovered \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" Let's Go\\" \\"My Wall\\" \\"Get Up!\\" etc., and realized something...they've gotten older. Jonathan Davis has seemed to have made peace with his past, and it really shows in the lyrics. They have gotten older and so have I. It's still the high anxiety influenced lyrics, just not about what it was in earlier albums.<br /><br />The way I see it, hearing about The Path of Totality on the radio back in late 2011 brought my interest in Korn back to life! The Path of Totality- not the best Korn album, but worth a listen if you're an old school and new school Korn fan!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|By now, there is probably isn't anyone that hasn't heard of the Hunger Games. The story is amazing, as is the story's heroine; Katniss Everdeen. The story is brutal at some points, beautiful at others and when you turn the final page of the book you sit there longing for more. The book is written in a compelling, easy to read and humorous way that makes it easy for anyone to pick up and fall in love with. It is getting people to read that would otherwise never read and spans multiple age groups; it is deserving of a five star rating.
0425170349|1.0|I have had been a real fan of Tom Clancy until I read this book years ago. First problem with this book as that whole paragraphs are repeated throughout the book. Tom seemed to be adding his own padding to make it a \\"Clancy\\" length book. but by far in the most way I find this book awful is his view of the Irish and the Irish troubles. \\"They are basically English anyway\\" is his view of Ireland. Tom in a world of slack jawed yokels militias all over the USA, maybe you should write about them as you seem to have digressed to this level over the years.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Hazel and Augustus Waters are two teens who are finding themselves attracted to each other, but they are also cancer survivors who daily must concern themselves with their health and mortality.  The author could easily have made this a maudlin soap opera, but he doesn't.  Hazel and Augustus have the most delightful and quirky sense of humor coupled with realistic compassion.<br /><br />Ordinarily, I don't really enjoy a book like this, but I did this one and I recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This trilogy is very compelling and well done. It does go a little overboard with the sex. I would have preferred less of it and more story line, but i understand the dominance of it leant to the characters development. So maybe just a little more interesting sex?<br /><br />It does provoke feelings for both characters, and to me that means the author has done her job. You are hooked and you care. I do not understand all the negative publicity this book has garnered or how it is viewed as demeaning to women. It is about 2 consenting adults and what they choose to do. I read books, because they are different from my everyday life and help us live vicariously through the characters. Is it a little much to believe that 1) a 21 yr old co-ed is a virgin and 2) the couple can possibly have that much sex ? Absolutely! But then again, no one picks this book to read about how a \\"20 something\\" balances laundry and daily chores while trying to excel in the work place after college.
0062059882|5.0|I absolutely love this novel. It is most definitely amongst my top ten favorite books.  The adventure, the style, everything about this book is captivating.  I recommend that anyone whom is old enough and mature enough should read this.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|app is excellent in content but crash problems move down to great. The variety of reading plans a real plus
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! this is a great way to read the Bible. I highly recommend it to anyone. I especially like the fact that you can listen to the Bible being read to you.
B0032KLAKE|1.0|I purchased this movie on DVD so I would have it in my movie library as it is one of my favorites.  I did not decide to watch it until 3 months after purchase.  This was my mistake.  The movie does not work and it was a waste of money.  Very disappointed that someone would sell you a DVD that looks perfectly fine but then doesn't work when it comes time to watch it.

068485743X|5.0|This book is probably the only resource out there  that spells out (using egregious examples) all the bad habits your editor keeps scribbling all over your manuscripts that you look at and go \\"WHAT?  What does this MEAN?\\"<br /><br />None of these bad habits are unique to writing how-to books.  Every book out there (and I've read a lot) TELLS you to eliminate these bad habits.  Eliminate unnecessary adverbs.  Show don't tell.  Blah blah blah...  But this is the only book out there that teaches you to SPOT these bad habits in your OWN writing when you know something's a little off, but you can't quite put your finger on it.  It's as though a lightbulb goes off in your head.  You can then go through your OWN manuscript chapter by chapter and see you've used one 'comparison' too many per page, or know how to reword that clunky spot of dialogue that keeps giving you trouble no matter how many times you rewrite it, or spot when your writing is reading more like a police report rather than prose.<br /><br />The publishing industry has changed.  This may be considered 'writing 101', but if you have ANY bad habits at all, you're going to get rejected because publishers no longer have the resources to have somebody edit your manuscript.  You'll just get rejected and never know why.  Ranting about the unfairness of it all won't change that fact.  Using this book, however, and others like it (Editing for Fiction Writers is another 5-star resource) to self-edit your manuscript before submitting it will increase your competitive edge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced story that will grab you from the first chapter. I read this after the hype and really enjoyed it.  You'll want to grab the second in the series quickly.
0743572750|5.0|Listening to this book reminds me why I think Cassandra Clare is one of the most talented authors I have had the honor of listening to. She is a storyteller like no other. I have already read this series but listening to it gives it a fresh vibe that makes me honored to be able to review.<br />The narrator Natalie Moore does a great job reading the story. She makes the perfect Clary. She has a voice that sounds like a teenager and that fits the story. She does an excellent job.<br />The storyline is just breath taking. It is remarkable and long lasting even after you are finished with this book. It is action packed and the romance in it just keeps me tuned in. Cassandra Clare does an excellent job of continuing on a world that she has created that is highly addictive.<br />The characters are well defined and stable. They are fine tuned in this story and you cant help but love them.<br />Listening to this series makes me know what an honor it is to review for Simon & Schuster audio. If you haven't read this book Run don't walk to start City of Bones. If you have read it and just want to refresh pick up the audio book of this series. It is absolutely worth it!<br /><br />Publisher-Simon & Schuster Audio<br />Reviewer Rating: 5 STARS (Would go higher if we had it!)<br />Reviewed by~Lora
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I got this game because it was free and was pleasantly surprised at just how much fun it is. I can't stop<br />playing, it is so addictive trying to collect all of the stars and moving on to the next level.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading The Hunger Games, and reading it via the Kindle app. I read all three books in the trilogy so quickly, I thought they must be really short. In reality, they're each around 400 pages. Thank you, Suzanne Collins!
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|One of the first things I learned when shooting video with my DSLR, is that the on-board audio is mediocre at the best of times. Even when shooting for personal use and not for a client, I was left disappointed by the high-frequency hiss that was almost impossible to remove in post. The Rode VideoMic quickly garnered the respect of many indie film makers as an inexpensive but excellent mobile audio solution without the purchase of a separate recording device.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Exceptional audio quality for a shotgun mic<br />- Decent build, wind-guard feels quite nice<br />- Easily adjusted gain<br /><br />CONS<br />- Wire seems a bit flimsy<br />- A tad pricey<br /><br />I feel as though Rode could have put a bit more effort into the build quality of this mic, especially for the price. That said, it really does perform quite well. If you are filming where lavalier mics are not an option (think wedding videography), this is a great option! If you have the budget, I would highly recommend a dedicated recording system.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|This game is a great arcade shooter. Looks great, controls.great, plenty of variety. The one con is especially the bosses, the game can be extremely difficult, even on casual difficulty. If you are up for the challenge then buy it. If not you will waste money to pull your hair out.
B00005MNP8|5.0|Blondie's third release is the one that propelled them to International stardom in 1979 once their big breakout single hit the charts. Producer Mike Chapman works his magic and brings out the best in Debbie and the boys (including new bass player Nigel Harrison and Frank Infante who helps Chris Stein give a fuller guitar sound) which includes a slightly more accessible sound for the general public yet still retaining enough of an edge as not to alienate the group's original fanbase. In fact, there's a little something for everyone here, which is likely the reason \\"Parallel Lines\\" sold so phenomenally. There's more of a rock-and-roll vibe here that wasn't present on their first two releases (on \\"Hangin' on the Telephone\\" and of course the classic scorching \\"One Way or Another\\"). The boys take lead vocals and get in some nasty guitar licks on \\"I Know But I Don't Know\\".<br /><br />Chapman's mixing brings Deb's vocals to the forefront more than they were on \\"Plastic Letters\\", yet they don't overpower. The '60s girl-group sound shows up on the lyrically brilliant \\"Picture This\\" which features one of Debbie's most convincing performances (you practically feel her frustration); and more pop-ish radio-friendly \\"Sunday Girl\\" which wasn't a chart hit in North America, but UK record buyers made it a smash overseas. And I dare you NOT to sing-along to \\"Pretty Baby\\", a Sandy Posey-like song circa 1967 (it even uses the phrase \\"Incense and Peppermints\\"!). A cover of Buddy Holly's \\"I'm Gonna Love You Too\\" is basically a throwaway but never gives me a reason to press the SKIP button either.<br /><br />Eerie keyboard and haunting drumbeats backup Debbie's cooing vocal on the atmospheric \\"Fade Away and Radiate\\" which ends with a cool reggae-flavoured outro. Though it's easy to take it for granted now, the album's big showpiece is an extended (but not overproduced like it was on \\"The Best of Blondie\\") Disco version of the song that made the group and Debbie household names. From the ear-catching percolating intro to Clem Burke's sharp drumming that take the listener in and out of the verses, there's little wonder why \\"Heart of Glass\\" remains one of the most popular tunes of its era. It's also Jimmy Destri's finest moment of the album as his keyboards give the song that \\"something extra\\" that was missing on the group's earlier versions (one of the Bonus Tracks here is a 1978 version while the \\"Plastic Letters\\" CD contains a slower, reggae-tinged version).<br /><br />When I peeled the shrinkwrap off this LP on Christmas Day 1979 and gave it my first spin, I inadvertently put on Side Two first without reading the label and have listened to it \\"backwards\\" ever since. I still think it plays better \\"my way\\" because of the one-two sucker punch of \\"11:59\\" and \\"Will Anything Happen\\" to kick it off--two of Blondie's most frantic, head-bopping numbers ever. The former builds to a terrific climax and perfectly showcases the talents of Destri and Burke while the band as a whole really shines on the latter. Deb gives off major attitude on the last cut on which the title says it all--\\"Just Go Away\\".<br /><br />Definitely Blondie's best album but I highly recommend you pick up their first two underrated releases as well.<br /><br />FIVE STARS.ar-catching percolating intro to Clem Burke's sharp drumming that take the listener in and out of the verses, there's little wonder why \\"Heart of Glass\\" remains one of the most popular tunes of its era.

B006H8BIIM|2.0|Poor graphics and poor gameplay mechanics make this game mediocre. Tower defense is about making real time strategy streamlined and elementary to understand.

B005LAIH2W|3.0|The creatures, topography & acting were great. The story had so little to do with the book A Princess of Mars, I was stunned. I was also unpleasantly surprised by the rip-off of the Return of the Jedi chase scene with the flyer. If you know nothing remotely about the character of the lead roles or the storyline then this could be rated a good show but they assassinated the characters as portrayed in the book.<br /><br />My wife said to me, \\"Well if you just remove Edgar Rice Burroughs from the movie & the movie people had come up with this on their own wouldn't you think this was good.\\" My reply was of course, \\"you mean if Edgar had never lived & they came up with the creatures, topography, alien races & the leads had no characteristics to go with them so they could write any story they wanted & assign characteristics to the roles as they see fit? It seems like that is killing Burroughs all over again & if you're going to do that then you can't advertise that it's based on a Burroughs's book or refer to A Princess of Mars at all. You've removed their hoped for initial fan base too.\\" I'm sick of Hollywood using classic literature as a front to draw in people & writing a story that has little or nothing to do with the source material.<br /><br />The show should do well with those that haven't read the books, don't know the characters as written by Burroughs & really just want effects & a wow factor. Fans of Burroughs will be turned off by this travesty of an interpretation of A Princess of Mars. I can't recommend it to Burroughs fans, myself included.<br /><br />Still the acting is great, the creatures looked exactly as described in the book & the topography was too. Why they assassinated the leads characters was totally baffling except for writer or director ego. They thought they could do better & they are always wrong. Burroughs created everything good about this movie & he didn't create the flawed storyline. They particularly did a hatchet job on the Red Men of Mars & Tardos Mors & Tars Tarkus. 2 Amazon stars for me but maybe 4 stars for those that don't know anything about the book.rs & Tardos Mors & Tars Tarkus. 2 Amazon stars for me but maybe 4 stars for those that don't know anything about the book.

0439023513|1.0|I can't believe how very poorly this book was written.  When you are a writer, especially one of a series.  You need to be aware of what your readers want, why they have chosen to take the time to read your story.  You need to know this so that you can address those ideas.  Collins writes this third book as if no one got attached to Katniss and Peeta in the first two books, as if we were all reading this book because we wanted a good war story.  I applauded the first two books where she didn't make katniss a sniveling boy crazy girl with nothing more on her mind. She had strength, spunk, and character.  She made you think. But in the last book the thing that everyone wanted to see was katniss finally give her heart away.  I wanted it to be Peeta, but even if it was Gale that would have been something.  No, in this final book it just shows her wasting away into a shell of herself.  Nothing.  the entire book is focused on the war.  There is no resolution.  Of course the Capitol is finally overthrown, but who cares.  If Collins actually thought that we were reading because we were invested in her fictional war.  We were invested in the characters!<br /><br /> There were many places in the book where she could have saved the book, but she just kept killing tha characters off.  In this book she kills them ALL off, either in flesh, spirit, or mind. Every last one the the characters is dead.  If her point was that this is what war does, well bravo. Most of us know war sucks, but we wern't reading this for a recap on that moral lesson. If we wanted that we could have picked up a book on the harsh realities of a real war..such as Vietnam.  This book was a EPIC FAIL!  It makes we feel like the first two were a waste of time, and I loved them.  So disgusted and disappointed.

B004N622EY|5.0|The Final Empire series by Brandon Sanderson confirms that he is not caught up with old paradigms.  When he took over the Wheel of Time series from Robert Jordan he brought a freshness to that body of work that was needed and now reading the Final Empire series I can certainly see why he was selected by Mrs Jordan as he has moved away from the traditional fantasy approach of bringing together a team of diverse peoples and other races and following a quest.  The Mistborn represent unique characters in fantasy writing and Brandon has given them a depth of ability and character that is quite remarkable.  An easy read that is very difficult to put down.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book is an excellent read/it is not a light book; very heartwrenching but such an important story.  Even though this book is a novel it insights you to the reality of what was really happening in Paris and the world.  Get out your tissues.

B000IZA9NK|5.0|Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow is a wonderful and unusual film.Where others fail this succeeds by showing the feel visually and in its story of a 1940's kids matinee comicbook hero serial. It is very fast paced with great tongue in cheek lines. Can SKY CAPTAIN tole rate POLLY long enough to save the world from TOTENKOPF\\"S plan of doom? A REALLY great cast and ALOT of fun.

1401232590|5.0|Far and away the best comic I've ever read. Loeb and Sale are incredible. The story is brilliant, the artwork is unique, even the color palette is a stroke of genius. It's the pacing that really makes it though. There's just enough material on each page that each panel draws you into the next. The story itself is an mystery epic spanning across a year in Gotham. While very plot-driven, it manages to handle a large number of characters well and do them all justice. Harvey Dent, Batman, Gordon, and Catwoman (among others) are expertly imagined and drawn in a noir-ish fashion that makes Gotham come alive.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this comic (or its sequel Dark Victory) enough.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|Cary Grant was a master of subtle romantic comedy, but he was also an outstanding actor in other films as well -- including this classic thriller in which he costars with the great James Mason and the beautiful Eva Marie Saint. In addition to being a classic thriller, this movie has an outstanding music score. In every way it is one of the best movies ever made. If you haven't yet seen it, you should.<br /><br />At the end of his career Grant received an Academy Award for lifetime achievement, but it amazes me that he was nominated only once for a best actor Academy Award when year after year he gave outstanding performances of various kinds which merited recognition. In my opinion, Cary Grant was the best performer of the Golden age of Hollywood -- as he shows again in this all time classic.

B004ZNARH4|3.0|Well, I was so excited to open up the treasure box of the DSOTM Immersion set only to discover that the MUSIC -- the MOST IMPORTANT TREASURE IN THE BOX -- was packed in the cheapest, crappiest way possible.  CD 6 -- the unreleased treasures -- and the Blu-Ray disc -- were floating around in their own little very tight paper sleeves separated from the 4 main discs which had broken loose from their cheap recessed round plastic \\"holders\\" at the very bottom of the box, and it seemed like at least two of the discs had managed to get scratched before I even touched them once.  I was SHOCKED that a package which was seemingly designed with such care treated the MAIN TREASURES of the box with such cheap thoughtlessness.  I'm sure I'll get over this... but I wanted to warn all you other potential buyers to beware!  Also, I bought the set about a week ago and it was $30 less than it is today!!  What would cause such a wild fluctuation in price months after the item was released??  Anyway, I paid $62 full price from Amazon.com and today the price is about $91.  ????  Cheers from Brooklyn.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in one day. I couldn't find a stopping point! It just kept getting better and better!
B000JMKNJ2|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, there were some really great things about it. For example, the fantasy world was fully formed and described, and the main character was a highly-entertaining, unapologetic liar and confidence man. But on the other hand, some things just did not work for me. For example, I felt bogged down in the numerous and overly thorough descriptions of the world. And the fantasy elements were too sparse for my taste.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is a story about a confidence gang that happens to exist in a fantasy setting. Outside of the world itself, the only remnant of fantasy found in this book a single character who is a Bondmage (i.e., sorcerer bad-guy dude). The Bondmage makes the gang's plans rather difficult to carry out. The Bondmage was fun, in an evil bad-guy sort of way, and I appreciated his presence in the story.<br /><br />Other than the Bondmage, the fantastical elements of the story were nothing more than a backdrop. I found this quite frustrating, because the fantasy backdrop was amazing, and I wanted so badly for it to be relevant. The land in which the story took place had been previously inhabited by some alien beings, who left their alien buildings behind. Also, lots of lighting and nature described in the book were provided by \\"alchemical\\" means. But these fantastical elements were never integrated into the plot. Rather, they were simply things for the author to describe--in great detail through which the reader must suffer despite the lack of direct relation to the story. While reading, I eventually wished that the world was a little less fantastical, so that I wouldn't have to hear about it all the time. I found myself skimming over descriptions in order to get back to the story.<br /><br />Let us now pretend that this book was about two-thirds a long as it actually was, and all the superfluous, irrelevant world description has been excised from the text. . . . I liked the story. It wasn't really a fantasy story, but I liked it nonetheless.<br /><br />Locke Lamora is a likable, flawed character. I loved the idea of his being a priest of the Nameless Thirteenth god, of whom the other Twelve gods are ashamed. The Nameless Thirteenth is the Crooked Warden, the God of Thieves. Love that! As a priest of the Nameless Thirteenth, Locke was able (to my great amusement) to justify his dubious actions by asserting his devotion to the will of the Crooked Warden!<br /><br />Locke Lamora always had another trick up his sleeve. He devised plots to steal money from the nobility and to squeeze himself and his gang out of tight spots. And when tragedy struck, he turned his attentions to plans of revenge. It really is a wonderful story, and Locke is a wonderful character.<br /><br />Despite the things I liked about this book, I do not see myself reading any other books in the Gentleman Bastards series. I simply do not look forward to suffering any more descriptions of that world.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|iiiee it be a Bless'n from this Irish lass whos voice is sweet as morn'n dew. Well anyway she can belt out the rockabilly like you ain't never heard before.

You can't go wrong here.This is the second albulm of hers i've purchased and she just keeps getting better!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is awesome. Really awesome. This book is made of awesomeness.<br /><br />Ready Player One takes place in the 2040s, when the real world is not a pleasant place, but virtual reality is advanced enough that many people prefer to live there instead. The OASIS, a huge virtual reality system that is open to the public, is more that just a virtual copy of this world. It is an expansive universe of virtual worlds, some of which are based on movies or video games.<br /><br />Basic functions of the OASIS are available to the public at no cost, but premium virtual items cost real money. By creating and managing the OASIS, Jim Halliday became a multi-billionaire . . . and then he died. In his will, Halliday invited members of the OASIS to participate in his game inside the OASIS. The winner of the game would become his heir.<br /><br />Halliday was a huge fan of 80s and 90s pop culture. Winning his game requires in-depth knowledge of this culture, especially as it relates to video games, books, and movies that are well-loved by the geek community (which happens to include me). As a result, this book is filled with pop culture references. It's just so much fun!<br /><br />The main character has dedicated his life to winning the game. Along the way he makes a few friends, who are also dedicated to winning. The antagonist is IOI, a company whose goal is to win Halliday's game. If IOI wins, it intends to privatize the OASIS, granting access only to those who can afford to pay the big bucks. With multi-billions at stake, IOI is willing to hunt down and murder the top players.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this book down. The plot was great; it was imaginative and exciting. The characters faced believable choices between their friendships and their goals, and they were reasonably and understandably hesitant about becoming part of the real world. I rooted for them every step of the way.<br /><br />My main problem with this book is that I did not notice a single reference to Michael Jackson. For a book that spends so much time throwing out 80s and 90s pop culture references, I felt like this was a huge oversight. But other than that, I adored this book.

B002LC8HF0|4.0|What to say? What to say? I feel strong ambivalence here.<br /><br />Things I loved: Elend. Vin lost fights from time to time (in contrast to The Well of Ascension, in which she uninterestingly won every single fight and saved everyone always). The fulfillment of Sazed's quest for truth in religion. Marsh's struggle against external control. The Lord Ruler being a good guy after all! (That's not a spoiler, by the way. That's just my opinion.) Oh yes, and of course . . . Elend.<br /><br />Things that made me want to pull my hair out: Hemalurgy everywhere. Everyone hears voices.<br /><br />Hemalurgy, like Allomancy and Feruchemy, is a sort of magic involving metals. In Hemalurgy, a first being's Allomantic or Feruchemical power is transferred to a second being through the use of a metal spike by (1) killing the first being with said spike and then (2) embedding said spike into said second being. This is the method through which Inquisitors are created. It turns out that some other beings introduced in Mistborn and The Well of Ascension were also created through Hemalurgy. So now let's get to why Hemalurgy annoyed me so much: It was everywhere, and it large quantities, it became a little unbelievable. Spikes through eyes. Spikes through hearts. Spikes through shoulders. Spikes to grant sentience. Spikes of various metals. Spikes, spikes, spikes, blah, blah blah. Too many spikes!<br /><br />So it turns out that the power Vin released at the Well of Ascension is called Ruin. Ruin is a god-like entity whose only desire is to destroy. Preservation, Ruin's opposite, was holding Ruin captive at the Well until Vin released Ruin. Unfortunately, creating Ruin's cage used up a great deal of Preservation's power, so Preservation needs assistance to stop Ruin. Throughout The Hero of Ages, Vin and her team seek to stop Ruin from destroying the world.<br /><br />Before I go further into my critique, I must first state for the record that, despite my issues with The Hero of Ages, Brandon Sanderson remains a genius in my opinion. But . . . too many concepts in the The Hero of Ages were repeated over and over and over again. I got a little bored. Begin loop: (1) There is lots of ash. (2) Vin seeks her destiny. (3) Someone is hearing voices. (4) Elend is trying to do the right thing. (5) There is more ash than there was before. (6) Someone is being stabbed by a spike. (7) Sazed is having a religious crisis. (8) The koloss are coming. Repeat loop. That about sums it up.<br /><br />The ending was great. Sanderson has a knack for writing great endings. I'm a little mad at myself that I didn't predict the ending. There were clues. I like an author who gives enough clues but still manages to surprise me.<br /><br />I may (or may not) revisit this review after I've had time to think some more about how it all wrapped up. For now, I think I'm a little disappointed. But I have to give this book a relatively high star rating just because it was inventive, and it did wrap up a beautiful trilogy. I enjoyed it. But I wanted it to be better.
B006ZHQ6SW|5.0|Criminal minds is heavy on the minds.  It may be \\"the show\\" for intellectuals, but it is high in suspense, even when they let you in on the culprit early in the show.  It may take some twists and turns, but the closeness of the characters and how they make up a family is one of the features that makes this so-called horror show so endearing.  I highly recommmend it.

0763644765|5.0|We have purchased over 5 different potty books for my 20 month old son, but none of them held his attention.. until this one!  My son loves the babies expressions, and loves following the baby while he makes the decision to use the potty.  When the baby actually uses the potty (it is a very cute and funny page), my son laughs every time!  I also enjoy reading the book... which makes a huge difference when you have to read it over and over.  My son asks for this book, which he has never done with any other potty book.<br /><br />All of Leslie Patricellis books we've purchased so far have been big hits in our home!  I also highly recommend \\"No No, Yes Yes\\", my son absolutely loves it, which I find wonderful because it teaches some great lessons on what is and is not ok to do (color on walls, run away from a parent, ect.)
0062073478|5.0|I recently had the pleasure of re-reading this story, not really by choice.  A chapter into the story, I was so happy I had been \\"forced\\" to read it.  Agatha Christie is the master of mystery, and this is one of her finest stories.  Read it.  Then read it again!
B006WXHJVC|5.0|I won't bore you about the actual movie. We all know what it's about and who is in it. I will say that the actual bluray is awesome. It's likely this will be the best this movie will ever look or sound on home video. The video looks amazing and the sound is right on. This isn't an action movie so you have to be realistic when it comes to the sound quality. Let me say, the entire cast looks amazing (especially Shannon)and there is plenty of background detail throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />This is a must buy for fans of the movie!!!! A+++++++++
B005Y4241K|5.0|Spot on vocals and sound. Little chatty at times during the show. The Royal Albert hall is a beautiful venue.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I highly recommend the MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware. This case gives the Kindle Fire the perfect feel and look for every day usage.
B003TSEL7S|3.0|My 15 year old daughter's review:<br />This was definitely an entertaining book. But Jason and Piper, two of the main characters,were extremely shallow kids/role models. Jason just moons around and shows off how cool his powers are, and Piper just whines about her problems to herself, and every chapter has at least one place where either Jason or Piper is moaning about how &#34;cute&#34; the other is. That is so unlikable. If you have to add teen romance, can't it at least be based on the characte/personality of the person, not their looks?<br />The only reasons that I was able to &#34;ok enjoy&#34; the book, was because at least in the character Leo, Riordan created a likable, honest, non-whiny kid. Also, the writing style and plot were still good. However, I agree with an earlier reviewer in that there is no need for the mild semi-profane language. Unfortunately, kids will pick up on that just with everyday life, they definitely don't need it in their books too. It's not horrible in the book, just taking God's name in vain way too much for my liking, but my main problem was the fact that it's the &#34;good role models&#34; doing it.<br />If you can overlook these defects, then you'll most likely love the book. For the record, The Son Of Neptune was way better! So here's to hoping that the Mark of Athena is the best yet.
B00003CX9E|1.0|This is probably the most over rated movie ever.It is boring and depressing.The only thing it is good at depicting is how much of an  ego maniac idiot Orson Welles was.

1400052181|5.0|This was the best book I have read in ages. Having worked in Women's Health most of my adult life, I found the text interesting , very unbiased and very thought provoking.
B005SFR7YE|4.0|I became aware of Phantom of the Opera due to the soundtrack of the play being used in Louisville's annual \\"Thunder Over Louisville\\" Fireworks show, after hearing the beautiful music, I had to see the show, I have seen it now live twice.<br /><br />The performance that was filmed was great, you get to see so much you wouldn't see at a live performance due to the closeups, I didn't mind the use of the screen's to double as backgrounds etc., I have seen other live performances that used tech in this way. some have commented that if put it on an HD set you can see how bad it looks because you can see each pixel. on my regular TV set I didn't have that problem.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the Chandelier didn't fall. I read that they didn't drop the chandelier for safety reasons due to the Royal Albert Hall they were in.<br />I loved the tribute to the play at the end Including Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sarah Brightman, (His Angel of Music), the original cast of P.O.T.O., etc.. This is at the end of the performance.<br />It was a Great show overall, and anyone who loves Phantom should love it, and anyone who doesn't know about it should see it, and make up their own mind.<br /><br />I know that this DVD was from the video that was simulcast and what you see is what you got.<br />Having said that, It would have been nice to include Closed Captions. Before anyone says you don't need it, it's a play.<br />It's a Video, and it could have included Captioning for those who need or would like to use it. they could also put the captioning under the letterbox so it doesn't block any of the picture<br />The lack of captioning, and the chandelier not falling were my only complaints.<br />I'd give it 4.5 stars, but only 4 or 5 were available.
B001P9KR94|1.0|The item is listed as Blu-ray/DVD Combo. It is actually a Blu-ray and digital Combo. there is no DVD Version in this package. Calling Amazon to verify content is fruitless since they just replace the item with another of the same.

B007JF87VS|4.0|Originally I said:<br />I gotta say, the first season was awesome... And I agree with so many other reviews I've seen: Season 2 is a soap opera.<br /><br />And I'm bored to tears with that danged farm...<br /><br />I hope the producers and writers get the series back on track. I don't want to watch Twilight with zombies. =(<br /><br />***************<br /><br />Then I saw this episode:<br />\\"Better Angels\\" greatly speeds up the slowing plot. I gotta say if it wasn't for this episode I wouldn't keep watching. But this one takes us further into the world of zombies I think most of us fell into with the first season.<br /><br />Keep up this speed and tack and the series will continue the greatness season 1 started.
B001GMQALY|3.0|Well, to start, the soundtrack for this movie is great! It really takes you back to the 80s. Mickey Rourke's character was very mysterious and Kim Bassinger's character was that of a woman of the 80s when sex was on the cusp of change, on the cusp of an era where you would begin to see it and hear it more. I like Rourke's character because of the experimental nature of it. Maybe I'm into these things, maybe I'm not, but his facial expressions and demeanor were on point! Bassinger often does well in films and she did not spare this one, even at her young age. She had all the vulnerabilities of a woman and her acting was believable. Worth watching. Very intimate sex scenes. They were not porn for me, just parts of a good movie. I actually noticed the cats in the movie. I'm sure they were on purpose, but there was a cat at Bassinger's house that was sort of profound and one in the alley with a rat in his mouth when they were running from the men. There was actually a 3rd but I can't remember where. I wonder why the cats? I liked the cats, though. I liked the reggae music infused in and the song by Eurythmics blew my mind! A great 80s flick with all the elements- music, love, love-making, art, food, flea market shopping, dancing, running through the streets laughing (not so much necessary), friends, Billie Holiday. What more can you ask for? I'm sad it was only 9 1/2 weeks! They should have just gone 10! Furthermore, I always notice editing mistakes in movies and at 19:46 there is one! They are in the art gallery and in one scene she has on a white glove and then a second later no glove! Funny.

B001TWT0AE|5.0|If you like Westerns and like Jimmy Stewart & John<br />Wayne, You will be very happy with this DVD. It is<br />a very good western and with those two actors, you<br />can't go wrong. The story is amusing and entertaining. I believe it's a must buy for any<br />Western fan!
0307949486|2.0|1 star because I finished this and another star for the fact that those statistics that head each part are real and should be taken very seriously. All of the Apple, McDonald's and Coke plugs, as well as a subplot involving biblical symbolism were really contrived. I empathized during several scenes of brutal torture (like whoa), but the rest of the book was descriptions of room decor and news articles peppered with even more boring descriptions of casual sex (\\"Blomkvist was pretty good in bed\\" etc). I am exaggerating of course but really, how did this sell so many copies?  I don't get it. I have nothing particularly nice to say about this book and am happily moving on to something else.
B00005UWMX|5.0|This is a well produced and very moving love story. The performances by the cast made it believable given that it was a fantasy movie. special effects were brilliant given the era it was made.
B0072X2O66|2.0|Russell Allen is a god among mortals in the world of rock and metal, and is probably the best singer I have ever heard. Same can be said about Mike Portnoy for drumming.. This band however is killed by three things: the fact that these are guys in their 40s trying to be avenged sevenfold, the tired and dull lyrics, and Mike Orlando's 'yngwie malmsteen having a seizure' style of guitar playing. Its sad because this band with a quality guitarist and more room for Rus to sing rather than shout would have been a monster. Orlando can shred, but it's just that...blind noodling with little regard for phrasing or feel. When he took a solo at the show last year, you can tell he is capable of great phrasing, but just chooses not to use it and instead sweep and tap the entire fretboard like malmsteen on speed.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the album has a few good tracks and Rus and MP are phenomenal musicians, but the whole thing comes off like MP chasing something he would have wanted 20 years ago. The result is an album that certainly rocks pretty damn hard, but doesn't feel genuine. And that ruins it for me. I'd probably have loved this album of it came out when I was 15, but having heard what these musicians have to offer in their respective bands forever ruins any chance I had of really digging this album.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|This is a wonderful, action packed, didn't-look-at-my-watch-once (which is more than I can say for \\"Pirates of the Caribbean 3\\")summer movie.  Was glad to see Ciaran Hinds and James Purefoy together again for the first time since \\"Rome\\" (but, alas, no \\"Oh, my...\\" nude scenes...) Prepare to be entertained!
0307272702|5.0|For anyone looking to understand the dynamics of metabolic function, and to have the benefit of up-to-date studies and science, this one is a lot of bang for the buck.<br /><br />From my own experience, what Mr. Taubes has to say is spot on, and while implementing the effort, due to the addictive effects of sugar and wheat components in folks that have been long-term insulin resistant, the \\"what to do about it\\" part is a clear pathway out of the woods of chronic obesity and its inevitable unhappy, diseased fellow travelers.<br /><br />Much, if not most chronic illness may have its roots in what we eat/don't eat.  The contents of this book may be your doorway back to the health and vitality you once enjoyed.

0307405095|4.0|I just got this cookbook and one thing jumped out at me: creme fraiche is used in probably a quarter of the recipes but no recipe or explanation were given of what exactly it is. At the end of the book it mentions sour cream and its \\"french cousin\\" creme fraiche. So are we supposed to substitute sour cream? There's a recipe for making creme fraiche on the internet, but nothing was given in this Martha Stewart Pie book.  Instead there is a recipe for making whipped cream; duh. If you can't even make whipped cream, a pie is probably going to be over your head.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't made any of these recipes but I certainly will. I'm not a huge fan of Martha Stewart. I find her annoyingly pretentious. But I'm all about great recipes and if that's what I can get from this book, then I'll be thrilled. I'll be sure to update this review when I've tried some pies and tarts.<br /><br />The photography is stunning, by the way. Martha always makes everything look lovely.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love, love stories of mankind struggling to survive following some sort of a world ending calamity.  From classics like Earth Abides and I am Legend to modern takes like the Dies the Fire series by S.M. Stirling- I've read most of them, and I'm proud to say that I don't live in a bomb shelter, or stockpile food!  Not yet anyway.<br /><br />I saw a review on Boing Boing for this series, and I'm so glad that I did- these books are FANTASTIC!  It's not even because it is one of my favorite genres, but it is just great storytelling.  My heart was pounding with anxiety on more than one occasion- definitely a strength of Mr. Howey's writing style.  The man can write action and tension in both this series and his Molly Fyde books.<br /><br />I just finished the last Wool book last night, and I feel an almost physical withdrawal from the story.  I want so badly to be back in that world!  I don't remember feeling this way about a book, at least not for a long time.  This is coming from a librarian who reads around 50-60 books a year!<br /><br />Count me as yet another Hugh Howey fan!
0061673730|2.0|Two stars! One for Pirsig putting pen to paper (all 514 dull pieces of them) and one for the apposite title. If Zen is patience, then I came damn close. What strength it took to not banish this book to my `begun but not finished' bookshelf. A dull pontification on the definition of `quality' (which is ironically lacking in the novel), and an unlikeable narrator who exemplifies the `genius is madness' slogan. His philosophical ramblings are not profound, just disturbed. And hellishly boring.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is uh- mazing!!!  There are so many fun games! I love it. You can play games like air hockey and car chases! its awesome.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and I love it so much but I wish the games didn't cost coins but overall I love this game a lot.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I enjoyed this book. At first I thought it was just another Vampire trilogy when Matthew was introduced. But, there are many twists and the story takes you to places you don't expect. The book is about the evolution of witches, vampires and daemons which is an interesting twist. The story pulled me in after only a few pages. I have already pre-ordered book 2 and can't wait to find out what happens to Diana in her travels.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is the best choice I have ever made!  Reading this daily will change your life.  You can decide what you need go read.....faith,love,marriage,relationships and so much more. Enjoy the word of God.  I chose contempory English version for me to really understand.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele has stayed #1 on the charts for a reason: incredible vocals and a classic pop/R&B sound that is universal. In a current music world where there is so much disposable music occupying the charts, it is a pleasure and joy to see the reign of Adele. Those who love Adele should check out another powerhouse of a vocalist from England: the late great Sandy Denny. Her folk/rock music with Fairport Convention, Fotheringay, and on her solo albums is also music that stands the test of time, but it is largely unknown. Check her out if you want to listen to music that will change your life.

IT'S NOT!!!! even the monsters will not die. percy remembers nothing about his life even through he remembers Annabeth. i loved the book and was sad to finish it because i now have wait for the next book to come out.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchased this because of all the excellent reviews and was not disappointed.  This was a page turner and I literally could not put it down until it was done.  I was really glad that I was able to quickly purchase the other 2 books, becuase boy they were sooo good.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this app because it's easy to use, there are a variety of versions, I can have it read to me and it's free! I thought the audio would be computer because the app is free and I was apprised to hear a human voice that reads with emotion. I would spend a fortune to get all my favorite bibles on my kindle.I also love the reading plan option.you can take notes and make then private our share them.I think it's wonderful!

B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is truly the best game of 2012. Now, I know some people are looking at this opinion and saying, &quot;This person is crazy!&quot; Well, if you are the ones who are saying that, you (probably) have an I pod touch, or an I phone, I pad, whatever because everybody knows: the best game on APPLE is Temple Run. But that's the problem. That game is on APPLE not ANDROID! So if you have a Kindle Fire, well this is your game
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Very well written book. Engrossing accounts, as clear as if I had been there. Terrifying and yet, I had a feeling of gratefulness for these young men/boys. I never could decide whether or not they fully realized their true value. WOW!

B0053JJLLC|1.0|I am a fan of the author but Micro lacks a basic premise that is anywhere near believeable.  While reading it I felt like I was watching an old Saturday morning TV show.  The trouble was that I wasn't 12 any longer.

B003CIG7AE|4.0|Band of Horses is one of those groups you want to put on for an extended road trip through the heart of America on a warm night with the windows rolled down, the album cover even shows you a picture of stars rolling by a scenic mountain.  Infinite Arms is a bit folksier than their last album Cease to Begin (and lacks any songs about great basketball players).  And though there may not be a song as great as Nobody's Gonna Love You on Infinite Arms, the album is more solid than the previous one.  The album starts off with the soothing Factory that sets a great mood.  The highlight of the album is Laredo, the hardest rocking song among the bunch with great visual lyrics.  And the album ends with the epic six minute Neighbor.  Infinite Arms is a must for your next road trip.

B004DMIIVO|4.0|The only reason that I picked this anime up was because people kept nagging me to. Then I watched it, and it totally wasn't what I had been expecting. It was entertaining, stunningly so, and it had all the criteria for a good anime movie. It had action, cool battles, and some sort of mortal peril for the main characters. It also had humor, and heartwarming moments, giving the movie a feeling of substance. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good movie, not just anime fans, I believe this is one that anyone can enjoy. If I had to describe this movie, I would call it a well-rounded movie that almost everyone would love. It has a hard, and probably true, commentary of how the world is headed (not gonna give spoilers), lovingly wrapped in all the fun and frivolity of anime. Two thumbs up.
B0002XV30Q|5.0|I liked the $10.50 price for the 2 disc set, which is cheaper than the $18.00 mp3 price at the time I purchased.  I had recently seen a wonderful live performance of the 2nd piano concerto, and being a fan of Saint-Saëns and of piano works in particular, I decided to give this a try.  I'm also a huge Andre Previn and Royal Philharmonic fan. And EMI continues their string of crisp and clear recordings remastered for current audio devices.  This CD was released in 2005, but the recording is from the 80s I believe (since Previn was the conductor of the Royal Philharmonic from 84 to 88).<br /><br />I had only previously heard the 2nd and the 4th concertos, so the rest of the album was new to me.  My one beef is that the booklet really seems to not portray these pieces as being very worthy, except the 2nd.  I felt that EMI was being a little unjust with their descriptions.  Granted they said 'not popular' several times, but the overall tone made me think the pieces were just 'filler'.  Not one mention of anything like \\"this album really shows the true beauty of those less heard pieces\\" or anything like that!  So with a bit of apprehension I listened.<br /><br />And I was blown away.  The delicate piano work by Jean-Philippe Collard perfectly suits these pieces.  Granted, his force in the 2nd concerto is not up to some recordings, but I enjoy the more fluid and vivid style he brings.  My real surprise was the 3rd and 5th concertos.  For what are apparently 'unheard' or 'unpopular' pieces, they struck a resounding chord with me.<br /><br />The piano is wonderfully intertwined with the amazing playing of the Royal Philharmonic.  Previn brings his usual grace and style to the conduction and it shows here.  Never does the orchestra overwhelm the piano.  They have a lovely dance and it is a real treat to listen to.<br /><br />I would say the real reason to purchase this is for the 'other' concertos (1, 3, 4, 5), since the second is regularly recorded on other compilations.  Plus the Wedding Cake and Africa are fun little add ons.  But having all 5 on two discs is a great addition to any classical piano lover's collection.  For the price I highly recommend it.lus the Wedding Cake and Africa are fun little add ons.  But having all 5 on two discs is a great addition to any classical piano lover's collection.

0740797719|5.0|I bought this book on sale because I had heard it mentioned by another artist whose work I admire but honestly, it's worth the full price and then some. This is without a doubt the most straightforward and complete book on color theory I have ever seen. On top of that it's well written and flows nicely from one topic to the next and never uses 500 words when 100 and a picture will do, unlike some other art theory books I have read.<br /><br />Everything is described clearly with plenty of visual examples and it covers a wide range of principles, from the very basics all the way down to the specifics of painting moonlit and underwater scenes. I really can't imagine needed anything but this book and your own eyes to gain a good, solid understanding of the subject.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Its new and modern. Its sort of a intelligent comdedy that is dumbed down just enough for most other people to understand it.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The first season certainly ended on a terrific note and fans could hardly wait for the next set of episodes in a thrilling, modernized Sherlock Holmes take.  In \\"Sherlock, Series II\\" we find the world's greatest consulting detective and his good doctor up to even more thrilling escapades.  Season I was so thrilling that I ordered the advance copy of Season II from the UK--it's not yet shown here in the States, but there is great anticipation for it, however.<br /><br />  Sherlock's \\"brilliance\\" has never been so cleverly presented.  Benedict Cumberbatch (as Sherlock) and Martin Freeman (Dr. Watson) seem perfectly matched and merely watching their bantering (and loyalty) is refreshing and at the same time touching.  The genius of Sherlock, just because it's been updated in time, is never in doubt--but updating it to modern times, with the latest of technological \\"gadgets\\" is also a bit mesmerizing.<br /><br />  In Series II, we find (only) three adventures: \\"A Scandal in Belgravia,\\" \\"The Hounds of Baskerville, \\" and  \\"The Reichenbach Fall,\\" are all based upon the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories, with, of course, clever updating.<br /><br />  And what Holmes adventures would be complete without at least a mention of Moriarty. We found him at the close of the final episode in Season I and, of course, we pick up where we left off.<br /><br />  At the end of \\"The Reichenbach Fall,\\" I was a bit shocked--but the realized that the clever producers have, once again, set us up for another season. It cannot come too soon.<br />  Clever, clever, clever!
B0051HNMTI|3.0|I had no idea this app existed until it was offered as the free app of the day.  I downloaded it and have used it since, but I'm only allowed to choose 5, 7.5, and 10 minute workouts for exercises #1.  I cannot choose exercises 2+, Random, or Customize and attempting to do so tells me I need the paid app.<br /><br />I've verified on this order page that I indeed did download the $.99 app, so I should have the paid app.  So why can't I do other workouts besides the set in #1?  I'm still doing these every day, but it's repetitious and I'm worried that my results will not be as satisfactory as they could be when being able to use all of the exercises.  I'm interested in paying for a couple of the other apps, but I'm afraid of running into the same problem.  I can't complain about a paid app I didn't pay for, but I would be upset if I paid [even $.99] for an app that's no different than the free app.<br /><br />For what little I'm able to do, though, it's great.  My abs are sore after each workout.  The app itself runs great on my T-Mobile Vibrant (Samsung Galaxy S I) and is simple to use and put together fantastically, though I do wish there was a rep counter rather than a timer. If I were able to utilize all workouts, this would definitely be a strong 5-star app.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|George Lucas in his creation of STAR WARS, James Cameron in his creation of AVATAR, the creators of Buck Rogers, the creators of Flash Gordon, and countless other writers and film directors for almost a century owe a tremendous amount of gratitude to Edgar Rice Burroughs and his Barsoom Chronicles (beginning with A PRINCESS OF MARS , first published under a different title in a short story in 1912). Burroughs is best known for creating Tarzan. However, Burroughs dabbled in several different genres, including science fiction. The most popular of these were the Barsoom Chronicles which feature John Carter and his descendants. After discovering John Carter a few years ago, I had looked forward to a major motion picture based upon Burrough's story. A PRINCESS OF MARS was a novel I toyed with transcribing into a screenplay of my own. Then, in the fall of 2011, I discover the story was being developed into a big-budget picture that was being directed by Andrew Stanton (director of FINDING NEMO and WALL-E) and co-written by literary darling Michael Chabon (author of THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER AND CLAY). So, I put my own desires aside to see what kind of John Carter movie would be made. The final result is a great action movie and one of the best movies of 2012.<br /><br />The movie begins on Earth in 1881. John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) is being followed by an unknown tracker. He succeeds in getting to the telegraph office to send a telegraph to his nephew, Edgar Burroughs, who shows up only to discover that his uncle has passed away and has made him the sole heir of his estate. One of the items left behind is Carter's personal journal which Burroughs begins reading.<br /><br />The book flashbacks thirteen years to 1868. John Carter is a former decorated Confederate calvaryman who just wants to work in his mine in the dessert and dig for gold. However, the U.S. government wants Carter to work for them. Carter ends up getting chased and finds himself in a cave filled with gold before being immediately transported to some strange place. Carter is discovered by a race of giant, green, four-armed aliens who are outsiders in a civil war between two separate races of people. During a skirmish in the sky, Carter saves a woman who turns out to be Princess Dejah (Lynn Collins). The Princess will do anything to save her people, but her father wants her to marry the leader of the opposing army. She would, but she believes the marriage will ultimately lead to the destruction of the entire planet. Like the green aliens that discovered him, she believes he is the key to turning the tide and saving Barsoom (Mars).<br /><br />I was completely enthralled by JOHN CARTER. I loved the framing device at the beginning and ending of the movie. I loved the action sequences. I love the romance between Carter and Princess Dejah. I loved the bonding relationship that occurs between Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and Sola (Samantha Morton) after she learns she is his daughter. I love the playfulness of the giant dog-like creature Woola and his devotion to Carter. This is an action movie, but the acting is solid and the script is well-written.<br /><br />As far as flaws, the film doesn't have many. The movie does jump around here at the beginning and some filmgoers might have difficulty understanding exactly what is happening where. Also, I felt that the flashback sequences to Carter's wife and child were misplaced: they either should have been developed more or completely cut. Lastly, although most of the special effects in the movie are seamless, there is one scene that isn't. This scene occurs about two-thirds of the way through the movie where John Carter is driving beneath the moving city; some of the shots in this sequence look computer-generated and stand out.<br /><br />JOHN CARTER is a welcome surprise. Disney completely dropped the ball in the marketing department (thanks in part to the failure in 2011 of MARS NEEDS MOMS) with this movie because the ad campaign for the picture is one of the worst I've ever seen for a major motion picture. Hopefully, word of mouth will cause the movie to succeed where marketing and advertising executives failed because JOHN CARTER is the best movie of the first three months of 2012.d campaign for the picture is one of the worst I've ever seen for a major motion picture. Hopefully, word of mouth will cause the movie to succeed where marketing and advertising executives failed because JOHN CARTER is the best movie of the first three months of 2012.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|This game is fun.  In Quest mode you encounter not only the expected Chinese tiles, but also tiles with Greek and Aztec symbols.  Lots of wild cards.  A bit hard to see the differene between some symbols unless you zoom in.
044024238X|5.0|This is the first book I read by Sophie Kinsella. What a Great book! I was pleasantly surprised. Keeps your attention, funny. You can see that the author has high quality standards. Will be checking out her other books as well.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was very leary about this album. I have always wished for DLR to get back with VH, but feared what a mess it could be, possibly tarnishing their pre-Hagar legendary status in rock history.<br />After hearing \\"Tattoo\\" on the radio, I was saddened. I hated it. Fortunately, my local radio station played \\"She's the Woman\\", and I was like, \\"now that's VH!\\", so I bought the CD (cause downloading is just geeky), and haven't taken it out of my CD player. I can't quit listening to it. I did not expect it ot be this good! \\"Big River\\", \\"She's the Woman\\", \\"Beat's Workin'\\", and \\"You and Your Blues\\" could all be rockin hits. \\"China Town\\" is a classic hard driving song that could have been on Women and Children First or Fair Warning. Ditto for \\"Bullethead\\". Riffs, hooks, off-time passages, fast, boogies, gallups - it's all there.<br /><br />Eddie, although most of the album is not his old Marshall \\"brown sound\\", is phenominal. There are moments where you hear the old sound, but lots of wah, whammy pedal, and neck pickup work, which is not typical old-school VH, but works just the same. His playing is brilliant. Alex is a monster. Period.<br /><br />Wolfgang is by far the one who shines on the album. Never has their been a VH album with this kind of bass ferocity and tightness in the rhythm section. Bravo kid.<br /><br />DLR voice on \\"Tattoo\\" sounds very strained, almost stroke-like, but get past that song, and you hear a pre-Diamond Dave that is on fire. His background vocals (which I can tell are him on a lot of the songs) is great. Honestly, I do not even miss Michael as much as I thought I would, although I wish he was present on the album. When I hear this album, I hear the \\"cool DLR\\" from the late 70's/early 80's. That says a lot. Great job DLR. BTW, lose the headset mic live. Please.<br /><br />Now the down side: I cannot stand how compressed and digitized new music sounds. They compress the final mix (notice how loud new cd's are compared to music recorded and mixed in the 90's and prior, and much organic). ANKOT has some harshness to the production and mix, but is not as bad as say, Metallic's \\"Death Magnetic\\" (great album, terrible harshness.) Analog recodings (AAD) sounds better... no contest.<br /><br />Also, whoever decided \\"Tattoo\\" should be the first release and representative of the album shoul be fired! Pronto!<br /><br />In closing, this is an album that when you listen to it, makes you want to roll down the windows in your vehicle on a summer day and crank it. That is what any good VH album should do.

B006P0FICE|2.0|I rented this due to the other negative reviews and I am glad I only rented it. I like Milla Jovovich but even she did not seem to be invested in this role of betrayers betraying other betrayed betrayers who betrayed betraying betrayers ad disgustum. She may not have been in this except her husband  directed it. A rather pointless exercise. Was this a comic book story? It was laughable but I did not find it funny. Too bad.<br />Swashbuckling. Rushing to the aid of damsels in distress. Rushing hither and thither. Breaking and entering. Intrigue as far as the eye can see. Airborne battle scenes as if at sea. Crashing atop Notre Dame? Was Director Anderson making a statement?  And everyone lived unhappily ever after.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is a bit of fun.  I enjoyed it but it can be annoying and frustrating. Over all good though.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Whedon's short lived series is a fantastic cult scifi, that gives me joy to this day. Fox worked very hard to kill this series and succeeded, but not before some of us fell in love with it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|using with thesecretweapon.org 's. approach and it is very feature rich.  I recommend following their manifesto and getting things done with this app.  Just a few features more would be nice like:  sort by tag ,  nesting the tags from the app.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|this book is so entertaining I found myself sharing passages with my friends to bring them laughter as well.  Many times while reading you think to yourself &#34;I cannot believe he said that&#34; Yes this book is worth the read.
0765350386|5.0|I just bought the Final Empire trilogy that begins with Mistborn.  I am addicted.  This book reminds me of a cross between Lord of the Rings and X-men (Magneto).  I bring the book to work with me so I can read during my lunch break and even sneak some pages throughout the day.  I love not only the unique abilities the Mitborn and Mistings have, but how there is an art to mastering each metal and this is expanded upon throughout the books.  I am terrible at summarizing and get way to wordy, thinking everything is important, and there are other summaries from the reviews.  I just wanted to express my new found addiction, and hope others have enjoyed this story as much as I have.
030788743X|4.0|I feel like Ernest Cline went through my brain and picked out all of the things I find to be cool and put them in Ready Player One: quests, video games, the 80s, David vs. Goliath, and the list goes on. If you want to read a book where upon closing it you think that was EPIC -Ready Player One is THE book to pick up.<br /><br />The year is 2044. Life pretty much sucks for everyone.  There's an energy crisis. Housing is crowded. Jobs are hard to find. Most people forget the trouble around them by escaping into OASIS, a virtual reality created by James Halliday.  When Halliday dies, he has no heir to leave his billion dollar empire to, and instead creates a quest - the first person to clear three gates and find the Easter egg left by Halliday - who leaves clues related to the 1980s- wins the empire.<br /><br />Look, if you loved The Westing Game as a kid, chances are you'll enjoy Ready Player One as they have a similar concept - but different executions. Wade 'Parzival' Watts, a young gamer, is the main character of Ready Player One. He is a bit of an underdog, with self deprecating humor, yet one can't help but root for Wade as he clears various gates in his race for the egg against other gamers and an evil corporation known as IPO and their paid gamers, the sixers, aka sux0rs.<br /><br />Ernest Cline's debut is a thrilling ride, one that rarely slows in pace. Every time a new key or gate is discovered, when wade gets closer to finding the egg - it's exciting. Even though the book takes place in the OASIS, a virtual reality, Cline's descriptions make this vicarious experience come alove.<br /><br />Ready Player One is recommended if you've ever felt like a nerd, if you've ever cheered for the little guy, if you think of the 80s with nostalgia. Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is an epic debut -I can't wait for Cline's next book.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|You don't need a multi-million dollar budget and big stars to make a good entertaining movie. This isn't my usual genre but I loved this hilarious film from Norway.<br /><br />We ride-along with some reporters in Hans' trollmobile as he goes about his clandestine work for the TSS, or Troll Security Service.  Hans is an expert on Trolls of all stripes, which apparently are real and not just Scandinavian folklore. It's his job to hunt down and destroy those who've been causing problems, but by the looks of his beat-up old trailer the work doesn't pay a lot. The hours are long and the stench is horrendous, but I guess someone has to do it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's simple and easy to use. This game is great for getting rid of boredom. Has a small ad when you start a game, but it takes 2 seconds to press skip.

B000YMJA7I|4.0|I got this baby for 25 cents and that was cool.  Good songs and yes, the GNR AFD album has a couple songs to help supplement my collection.  this made me hunt thru my old cds and didn't know i had the AFD cd.  Good collection of songs.  Still enjoy listening to GNR and some other classics of that time.
B005SNP6FS|3.0|Great soundtrack! Fantastic actors. Dayum, Farrell looks good in a suit. But aside from that, meh. It's not really cohesive. Farrell's character wants to go straight yet he's the most violent of all the players and I didn't feel it was because he needed to be. And others are correct about the accents. If you watch it, just to see Colin in a suit, of course, have the subtitles on. It was a disappointment but man, Farrell looks good in a suit. Two stars for the movie, three stars for the suit, four for the soundtrack. Averages a three rating.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It keeps all my notes, all together, on which ever device I happen to be using. An unlike a slip of paper, it doesn't get lost.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game was good and addictive but not that great.  I'd rather play angry birds. but I keep playing it.
B0065IA4F2|1.0|I'm not poking fun with my title, I'm being dead serious here. The only people who seem to think his music is good also think he is dreamy. It took me a long time to actually get a recommendation of what tracks I should listen to because every person who recommended him (now that i look back on it they were ALL white women)couldn't stop talking about how much they were in love with him.<br /><br />As for his music... His lyrics aren't anything special. They are not laughably stupid enough for me to enjoy (like i do with a lot of my favorite rap artists) but they are by no means intelligent either. One good thing is that he doesn't waste his time degrading women, however he instead spends a lot of time crying over some girl. A good majority of his songs are really slow paced and boring.<br /><br />Its not surprising that Drake is Lil' Wayne's protege because they are both completely over rated. Don't get me wrong, I am sure that Drake is the best new thing to some of you. If you like Lil Wayne or T-pain, by all means check out drake's stuff.<br /><br />If you are looking for some hard hip hop, Drake isn't for you. Check out POS, Hopsin, or even some of the big wigs like tech n9ne.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I have read and enjoyed the first 4 books; and preordered the DVDS, after watching trailers and reading reviews.<br />Wow, HBO has done it again!<br /><br />Here are several keys, IMHO:<br />1. Follows the books closely. Big positive as books are great.<br />2. Realistic Fantasy Adult Epic. Ideal for a high quality miniseries<br />3. Jaw dropping scenes, keep you on the edge of your seat!<br />4. No happy ever after archetype; it is harsh realism; good people die!<br />5. Characters and the plotlines evolve and grow/change, not always for the better!<br />6. Witty repartee' from the Imp, enuch and Littlefinger<br />7. Rate NC -17 for sex, language, nudity and gore; Adults only. Don't watch if you are easily offended.<br /><br />This is not for everyone, but for some, fantastic!<br />Can't wait for Season 2!
B006JD48NM|5.0|Watching this gave me goosebumps.  I knew the story, but this movie drew me in to the drama almost as if it was happening now, not almost 20 years ago.  Great film, great story.  You will not be disappointed.

B003VANOFY|4.0|Owned for an hour, will update if there any problems.<br /><br />My reason for choosing this item was mainly because I was sick and tired of getting a set of headphones only to have cables break internally (even after reasonable care).  I had originally bought a set of RCA wireless headphones from Walmart (non USB) and returned those in 48 hours due to a lot of interference and general feeling of being ripped off.  I then looked on Amazon and found these.  I paid around $127 for them (but had to wait weeks for shipping).. and for that amount I expect a quality product - I wouldn't have paid much if any more for them.<br /><br />The rechargeable battery can be replaced but it's non-standard so you have to order from Logitech ($5 + the same or more for shipping).<br /><br />Anyway.. item came with approx 2.5 hours of charge (manual says up to 10 hours fully charged with a full charge taking 2.5 hours).. the SOUND QUALITY (barring all this audiophile nonsense) is *VERY* GOOD, enough to send me here to make a positive review.<br /><br />As for fit, I have a large head :'( and it's not at all uncomfortable.<br /><br />The only negatives so far is that the wireless feature doesn't seem to allow more than 2 thin walls before the audio cuts out (may be different with a fully charged battery?) and the worry of having to obtain a battery in the future.<br /><br />EDIT ONE<br />========<br /><br />POSITIVE NOTE: Software is telling me \\"Less than 55 minutes\\" of battery left and made a soft beep about 5 mins ago.. a good thing! (around 30 mins later) again saying \\"Less than 29 minutes\\".<br /><br />As mentioned earlier will report back if any problems.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This program is a real nice weather program for android system. It works nicely on my impression tablet. Love the radar function it looks real good. A++++ I would recomend this app to anyone!!!
0439023521|5.0|This book was very reasonably priced and arrived very quickly. I dove right into it and the book itself was a very good one indeed. One that I could barely tear myself away from. This seller was extremely efficient and practical.
B003QNXPUK|5.0|I love finding Zagg products on Amazon. It's a great product and to pay less for it always a bonus. I received my orders within 2 days. Great product and fast delivery...what more can you ask for?
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I'm so glad we stumbled upon this movie. The story is a nice switch up from formula fare and I found it funny/gross along the same lines as the Scream franchise. There are some great one liners we've walked away with; \\"We've had a doosey of a day\\" being my favorite.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book is amazing, it made me think, and question myself and wonder \\"what if?\\" I really like the plot and story line, very creative & mind-boggling. For 25¢ this was a steal!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was hesitant to read this book. After reading it  am glad I eventually got around to it. Witty and full of notalgia for 20-30 somethings. GG cline. GG.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I wasn't sure of what to expect since P D James' other books tend to be dark and intellectual.  This one is certainly different than her others I but enjoyed it immensely, perhaps because I tend to like historical mysteries. There is less fluff (dress descriptions, fawning lovers, etc.) in Pemberley than others of the genre and the plot twists are more interesting & unexpected. There was some James darkness - perhaps a touch of Anne Perry  - in revealing how life was for the lower classes then. I'd like to see a few more with this cast of characters.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|I could watch this video over and over for days. It is so satisfying and reassuring to see good triumph over evil.
B005PK1G76|5.0|We bought this item to use on our lightweight stroller for our trip to Disney World (we have a Chicco Liteway).  It worked perfectly. It was so nice to have somewhere to put our drinks and other small items within reach vs trying to hold drinks and steer through the crowds. It easily held three medium drinks plus had room for snack bars or my phone. Love the addition of this to our stroller! Great product!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a very good app with lots of fun I would recommend this to people who like games it has pretty good graphics for a game like this
B0055SWM08|4.0|the game is fun. I really enjoy playing the game a lot. the levels appeal to my sense of curiousity.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book will help you communicate with your spouse. My wife and I had no idea that a big part of our problem was that we were showing love to each other the wrong way.<br /><br />After we read the book, lights and bells began going off and I knew my wife's love language and she knew mine. Have we stopped arguing all together in 30 days? No...but we are communicating that we love each other better and we do argue alot less.<br /><br />This book is not only for the married couples. You can take the principles from this book and apply it to your other friends, family and co-workers.

B005EGXNLS|2.0|Holy dialogue tags Batman! Look, I know that it's a petty complaint, but goodness gracious. Mr. Cornwell tags two person conversations ALL the way through. I like the story so far, and I'm really, really trying to simply skip over them. In fact, in most stories that's exactly what happens--I don't even \\"see\\" the \\"he said.\\" But when it is everywhere it is hard (at least for me) to not get bogged down and lose the flow of a story I want to enjoy.<br /><br />Most writers will lead into a piece of dialogue with an action that negates the tag OR they will tag the dialogue, i.e.:<br /><br />Frank smiled. \\"Yeah, I know.\\"<br /><br />OR<br /><br />Yeah, I know,\\" said Frank.<br /><br />Mr. Cornwell is the doing both!<br /><br />Willibald flapped his hands. \\"Miracles happen, lord,\\" he said. ????<br /><br />And the \\"death by a thousand thesaurus searches\\" is horrible--How many different ways can you say \\"said\\"?<br /><br />He suggested<br />I snarled<br />He hesitated<br />He started<br />I retorted<br />He put in<br />I suggested<br />He stopped<br />He gasped<br />I shouted<br />I called<br />He finished<br />I asked (In a two person conversation punctuated by a question mark, Who else is asking????).<br /><br />And what's making it most difficult to skip over is frankly a bit of laziness on the author's part.<br /><br />\\"The priest said sharply.\\"<br />\\"I said, looking gloomily at the priests.\\"<br />\\"Willibald said happily.\\"<br /><br />Every other good author I've read knows how to write this without a tag. They slip in a facial expression, hand gesture, grunt, or some other action that not only let's me know who is about to speak but how the person said what they said without tossing in \\"he said gloomily.\\"<br /><br />Like I said. It's petty, I said with a sigh. But when it's everywhere, I groaned noisily. It starts to suck, I lamented.
B000LB7G00|4.0|I had a few problems with the mouse when I started using it as I was running Windows 7 (64 bit) in compatibility mode (as XP) for SolidWorks 2007.  However, the 3d mouse driver did not support this.  I called their support line and they stated that there was nothing they could do to help, because of how I was running SW.  I ended up procuring SW 2011 and it runs just fine with it.<br /><br />The mouse itself is great!  It makes me much more efficient, especially when I am assembling in SolidWorks.  I've used it a bit with Altium Designer and it worked with the 3d models of the PCBs.  It's very easy to change button configurations and sensitivity.  All in all, I would buy it again.

0091936969|1.0|The trouble here is not the idea, which is the machines-take-over meme of seven of ten techno-thrillers. It's weak execution.  For starters, the jig is up early  The author, for no obvious gain, lets you in the minds of Hugo, Gabrielle and LeClerc, who are the only semi-characters in the book other than Hoffman, who himself never acquires much shape. You deduce, far earlier than you want to, what's going on.  For an airport terminal pick-up, that's fatal.<br /><br />Also certain key plot elements, such as the complete buy-out of all Gabrielle's art, all the medical issues and procedures, etc., don't even make sense within the strained logic of the overall plot. Surely, if the VIX machine is both smart and intent on driving Hoffman mad, there would be countless easier ways than the ones it chooses (especially considering how easy it dispatches with that risk manager).  The fact is, it's never clear exactly why the machine is trying to screw with Hoffman anyway.<br /><br />I will still trust this author with historical fiction - Fatherland, Enigma were winners -- and he retains a nice feel for European cities.  But he's out of his element here, and perhaps out of his century.
B005BDZN62|5.0|Romantically speaking, the delicate crescendo of unfinished love dominates this powerful classic (easily one of the finest dramatic musicals ever produced). The unfolding of love, passion, and intimacy between Tony and Maria, like the riptide, spills into the soul of this film. Their whispered and orchestrated words on the balcony create nuances beyond the realm of normal drama. Their marriage before God establishes their union, solidifies the romantic crescendo, and allows Maria to mourn her husband's death at the end. It is a complete tragedy on all respective levels.<br /><br />All meetings between Tony (played by Richard Beymer) and Maria (played by Natalie Wood) are stunning in presentation. The musical overtures are superb, the dancing is brilliant, and the conflict between the Jets and Sharks (women included) has its own originality in classical terms. Yet, Maria alone commands the stage in virtually all tender moments (except those involving Anita); our heroine's softness, intelligence, and untested wisdom establishes her emotive control of the play (start to finish). In as much as her humility does not detract from the other powerful performances, Maria displays honor, sacrifice, depth, and commitment throughout the entire drama. We observe Natalie Wood in her finest hour as a gifted actress.<br /><br />The principles of romantic tragedy dominant this play in its careful adherence to the plot and character development within Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (who is Maria's unspoken mentor in matters of passion and control of one's lover). She redirects Tony away from secreted romance into the tragic consequences of interfering with the rumble; the deaths of Bernardo (her brother) and Riff (Tony's closest friend) are related (within dramatic irony) to her secret intervention (supposedly on their behalf). In truth, this masterpiece resides in both categories, tragedy and romance; bound (perhaps) by her mournful voice, \\"Don't you touch him!\\" Our catharsis is directly affected by Maria's youthful passion related to unfinished love in its most delicate stages.

B005NKGEP2|1.0|I can't believe that the publishers think that they should charge over $19.00 for the e-book when Amazon is only asking under $16.00 for the HARDCOVER version.  I'd buy this at $9.99, but not when it's priced way over the hardcover version.  This is NUTS!!
B002XQI7VS|5.0|La orilla de la navaja corta por este drama poderoso de Holocausto de l Segunda Guerra Mundial \\"El Nino con el Pijama de Rayas\\" con ningún remordimiento. Presenciamos directamente en esta película las atrocidades de un campo de concentración y la normalidad de una familia, un padre Ralf (el oficial de S que es comandante de campamento), la madre Elsa (que cree que su marido supervisa un campo de trabajos forzados, entonces hallazgos fuera ello son un campo de exterminio), su de 13 años de edad hija Gretel (que ingenuamente abraza propaganda nazi), y su de 8 años de edad hijo Bruno (que ofrece amistad a en secreto un 8 año El chico judío viejo denominó Shmuel en el campamento y determina solo - que la propaganda es falsa basada en sus propias observaciones de familias judías y sus conversaciones con el otro chico).<br /><br />Esta revelación por Bruno maneja el complot. Su amistad con Shmuel crece en un bono fuerte, mucho más cerca que su relación con su padre, con la madre, o con la hermana. Bruno sale a hurtadillas para ver a su amigo, los riesgos para ser agarrados - todo el tiempo él escucha sus palabras engañosas, farisaicas y dogmáticas de padre acerca de personas en el campamento. Dibuja sus propias conclusiones. Bruno comienza a ver su propia \\"obligación noble\\" por la perspectiva humilde de su amigo íntimo, un chico judío.<br /><br />Llega a ser nuestro héroe en el sentido más verdadero, porque él no acepta las mentiras, el engaño, la hipocresía, asesino atento, ni la tiranía de los nazis y su juicio sobre judíos. Hace su propia mente. Sobrepasa la mal civilizada presentada a él - entrar el horno de la muerte con su amigo íntimo. El sacrificio de Bruno con Shmuel de la vida misma llega a ser un testamento de enchufará y agraciará, aparte de los horrores del campamento y su método de ejecución. Como una audiencia, nosotros crecemos en la estatura presenciando esta tragedia épica por los ojos de niños inocentes.<br /><br />En esta película nosotros presentimos destino, el terror, la angustia, la desesperanza, y sufriendo más allá de la comprensión humana. Sabemos de la \\"Lista de Schindler\\" y otras películas de campo de concentración - lo que aguarda a estos presos. Entonces fuera de la severidad del argumento - observamos que la humildad extrema y comprendiendo en la parte de dos chicos. Somos permitidos compenetrar con ellos, aún como su amistad es separada por alambres y perros guardianes con púas; aún como aguardan otero de la muerte del verdugo juntos - que es un pensamiento entumecido de por sí.<br /><br />La profundidad de carácter y complot es uniformemente penetrante. La ironía dramática es presente como la tiranía lleva la máscara de un oficial militar algo civilizado con una familia algo normal que últimamente debe darse cuenta de que ha dado sin querer la orden a exterminar a su propio hijo. Gemir agonizado de su esposa Elsa resuena la aceptación silenciosa de madres judías que son conducidas en manada en los hornos. Magnífico performaces de actores de carácter y actrices experimentados hace esta película un logro raro para su director y la tripulación. Las unidades son adheridas a con disciplina en el sentido de cinematografía.
B006J38144|3.0|Hey. I love SOA and thought this was a great season. Except for the fact that the finale seemed more like a mid-season show. Everyone knew that Jax would be taking the reigns. Just because everyone knows that a 5th and 6th season have been approved, that doesn't excuse the finale to be so anti-climatic. I really hope they pick up the pace for season 5.
B005LZW7T6|4.0|Il margine del rasoio taglia attraverso questo dramma di Olocausto di seconda guerra mondiale potente \\"Il Bambino la Truffa Il Pigiama UN Righe\\" con nessun rimorso. Testimoniamo di prima mano in questo film le atrocità di un campo di concentramento e la normalità di una famiglia, un Ralf di padre (il S l'ufficiale che è il comandante di campeggio), l'Elsa di madre (che crede che suo marito sovrintenda un campo di lavoro, une poi scoperte fuori da è un campeggio di morte), il loro 13 anno vecchio Gretel di figlia (che abbraccia ingenuamente il proganda di nazista), ed il loro 8 anno vecchio Bruno di figlio (che aiuta segretamente un 8 anno Il vecchio ragazzo Ebreo ha nominato Shmuel nel campeggio e determina di propria iniziativa - che la propaganda è falso basato sulle sue proprie osservazioni di famiglie Ebree e le sue conversazioni con l'altro ragazzo).<br /><br />Questa rivelazione da Bruno guida il complotto. La sua amicizia con Shmuel cresce in un vincolo forte, molto più vicino del suo rapporto con suo padre, sua madre o sua sorella. Bruno si insinua fuori per vedere il suo amico, i rischi essendo presi - tutto il mentre ascolta le parole ingannevoli,, farisaici, dogmatici delle persone nel campeggio di suo padre. Disegna le sue proprie conclusioni. Bruno inizia a vedere il suo proprio \\"obbligo nobile\\" attraverso la prospettiva umile del suo amico vicino, un ragazzo Ebreo. Diventa il nostro eroe nel più vero senso, perché non accetta le bugie, l'inganno, l'ipocrisia, l'intento omicida o la tirannia dei nazisti ed il loro giudizio sugli Ebrei. Inventa la sua propria mente. È superiore al civilizzato malvagio presentato a lui - di andare nel forno di morte con il suo amico vicino. Il sacrificio di Bruno con Shmuel di vita diventa un testamento di alimenterà ed ornerà, a prescindere dagli orrori del campeggio ed il suo metodo di esecuzione. Come un pubblico, cresciamo nella statura testimoniando questa tragedia epica attraverso gli occhi di bambini innocenti.<br /><br />In questo film percepiamo la sorte, teme, l'agonia, la disperazione e soffrendo oltre la comprensione umana. Sappiamo dall' \\"Elenco dello Schindler\\" e gli altri film di campo di concentramento - ciò che attende questi internati. Poi fuori da della severità della trama - osserviamo l'umiltà estrema e capendo da parte di due ragazzi. Siamo consentiti identificarsi con loro, anche poiché la loro amicizia è separata dai fili metallici dentellati e dai cani da guardia; anche poiché attendono la collinetta di morte del carnefice insieme - che è un pensiero intorpidito in e di sé. La profondità di carattere ed il complotto abbonda in questo film. L'ironia drammatica è attuale poiché la tirannia indossa la maschera di un ufficiale un poco civilizzato militare con una famiglia un poco normale che deve realizzare in definitiva che ha dato involontariamente all'ordine per sterminare suo proprio figlio. Il gemere angosciato del suo Elsa di moglie risuona l'accettazione silenziosa di madri Ebree che sono guidato nei forni. Il performaces superbo dai caratteristi con esperienza e le attrici fa questo film una realizzazione rara per il suo direttore ed il suo equipaggio. Le unità sono aderite a con la disciplina nel senso di produzione cinematografica.
B0071QIN00|4.0|For a free app, this is addicting to play if you like a simple game of going through the obstacles. Levels are hard and challenging, and going for all three stars on any levels will take trial and error. This game does not have fancy tricks, but just a simple timing and proper tilting of the phone. If you are looking for something to kill time, I would recommend this, and it will fun for awhile.
B00628RVV0|5.0|The razor's edge cuts through this powerful WWII Holocaust drama \\"Il Bambino Con Il Pigiama A Righe\\" with no remorse. We witness firsthand in this film the atrocities of one concentration camp and the normalcy of one family, a father Ralf (the SS officer who is camp commandant), the mother Elsa (who believes her husband supervises a labor camp, then finds out it is a death camp), their 13 year old daughter Gretel (who naively embraces Nazi propaganda), and their 8 year old son Bruno (who secretly befriends an 8 year old Jewish boy named Shmuel in the camp and determines on his own - that the propaganda is false based on his own observations of Jewish families and his conversations with the other boy).<br /><br />This revelation by Bruno drives the plot. His friendship with Shmuel grows into a strong bond, much closer than his relationship with his father, mother, or sister. Bruno sneaks out to see his friend, risks being caught - all the while he listens to his father's deceitful, self-righteous, dogmatic words about people in the camp. He draws his own conclusions. Bruno begins to see his own 'noble obligation' through the humble perspective of his close friend, a Jewish boy. He becomes our hero in the truest sense, because he does not accept the lies, deceit, hypocrisy, murderous intent, or tyranny of the Nazis and their judgement upon Jews. He makes up his own mind. He rises above the civilized evil presented to him - to go into the oven of death with his close friend. Bruno's sacrifice with Shmuel of life itself becomes a testament of will power and grace, apart from the horrors of the camp and its method of execution. As an audience, we grow in stature by witnessing this epic tragedy through the eyes of innocent children.<br /><br />In this film we sense doom, dread, agony, hopelessness, and suffering beyond human comprehension. We know from \\"Schindler's List\\" and other concentration camp films - what awaits these inmates. Then out of the severity of the storyline - we observe the extreme humility and understanding on the part of two boys. We are allowed to empathize with them, even as their friendship is separated by barbed wires and guard dogs; even as they await the executioner's death knoll together - which is a numbing thought in and of itself. Depth of character and plot are evenly pervasive. Dramatic irony is present as tyranny wears the mask of a somewhat civilized military officer with a somewhat normal family who ultimately must realize that he has unintentionally given the order to exterminate his own son. The agonized wailing of his wife Elsa echoes the silent acceptance of Jewish mothers who are herded into the ovens. Superb performaces from seasoned character actors and actresses make this film a rare accomplishment for its director and crew. The unities are adhered to with discipline in the filmmaking sense.

0062082353|5.0|A gripping true story of the most successful sniper in U.S. military history.  The matter of fact manner in which he talks about taking out the \\"savages\\" he considers neccessary to protect his boys.  As he says, it is all about the opportunities to do his job that made his confirmed kills so numerous.  He did pay a price and I think he is still paying that price.  I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to hear a first hand description of battle in Iraq.  A 5 star read.<br />Richard<br />Louisiana
B004UHSB5A|1.0|Played dominoes for years, always with the &quot;4 doubles&quot; rule...this game needs that. Routinely gives player 3 to 5 doubles per hand. While the AI will help you unload them in most cases, the rate at which you get those hands are ridiculous! Also, I can now tell when the AI is gonna skunk me (no you can't stop it) or let me win. I know bad hands happen in dominoes, but this game doesn't even play the odds... you will get a bad hand more often than not.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I started out by downloading the sample only cause I didn't know if I was ready to spend the $20 for the books. by the time I got to the end of the sample I was hooked. These books are amazing with in the first 24 hours I had the feist book read and started the second and I didn't want the third to Dinah cause I wanted to keep reading. I will say when I picked the book up I had no clue what I was going to encounter but glad that I take my time to read them all. Overall the colons are so good I doing think the movies will be able to compare. It is def  must read!!

B004HO6I4M|5.0|Rio is a joyful movie. Imagine crazy spashes of color meshed into a fun and thoughtful story. Blu, a blue macaw, is captured by poachers in Brazil and is lost on the way to a pet store somewhere in Moose Lake, MN (a real place, by the way). A kindly bookstore owner adopts him only to be later convinced to bring him back to Rio so he can procreate with beautiful Jewel, another rare macaw. Much ensues that includes the Carnival, thrilling rides, smuggling, a gangster bird, crazy monkeys, and much more.<br /><br />I can't recall a movie as beautifully made as Rio and for that I highly recommend it. There are a few annoying but fleeting moments that relate to pop culture but they pass fairly quickly and some may actually enjoy them (Lionel Richie fans, anyone? Do you like rapping cardinals and samba-ing canaries?).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

1451627289|5.0|This book was the best Stephen King in a long time. I haven't read the last few that he's written - although I've read everything up to Insomnia. I just couldn't get into any of the more recent books. I loved 11/22/63. The whole concept was great. Wouldn't we all love to go back in time. It was a wonderful adventure story and love story. I couldn't put it down. The only thing that annoyed me in the book was the fact that all writers have to stick their two cents in about politics. There was one passage that insinuated that tea party patriots were racists. All I can say is \\"Shut up and write.\\" I have stopped reading a lot of good authors because they just couldn't keep it to themselves. When do you suppose they'll get the picture that there are a lot of people buying their books who don't agree with them politically. Anyway, other than that little discordant note, it was a great book and I highly recommend it.
0439023521|4.0|Aldous Huxley and George Orwell would be proud of Suzanne Collins. With a fresh, updated perspective - but drawing from works like \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" - Suzanne Collins tells a compelling story about a dystopian future America - called 'Panem' - where the government stimulates the fears of the population by reminding them of the ugly consequences of 'District 13's' uprising by imposing the annual \\"Hunger Games\\" - a 24-man battle royale, where only one girl or boy (between the ages of 10 and 18) is left standing.<br /><br />As in any good dystopia the government is frighteningly shallow and hedonistic, and the rest of the population is alienated, homogenous and repressed.  And I suppose what actually makes The Hunger Games SO compelling is that the world which Suzanne Collins weaves is SO disturbingly possible, it's scary.<br /><br />No one wants to believe that someday in the future we may be so oppressed by a government that we submit to offering our children up, like sacrificial lambs, to fight to the death. Just like no one wanted to believe that \\"Big Brother\\" would ever always be \\"watching\\" us.  But look at where we are today with government interference into privacy laws, and the technological abilities to map anyones location with their cell phone  Big Brother is more real today than it ever was in George Orwell's imagination some 60+ years ago.<br /><br />In The Hunger Games, Suzanne Collins brings to the pages a book that will capture both young and adult readers with a brilliantly written story.  But between the lines lies the warning of a political satire: watch out what deadly follies you are making, and change them before it's too late!<br /><br />Just as 1984 was once compulsory in high schools around the world, perhaps with it's new-age spin and younger characters The Hunger Games will someday follow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Due to my grandson's excitement and enthusiasm about reading this book (which is rare), I decided to give it a try.  Wow!  I could not put it down and now I am hooked on the series.  Thank you Suzanne Collins for writing books that are so well written, exciting, and appealing to all ages.

B006OKOZGU|5.0|\\"To Catch A Thief\\" has always been one of my favorite movies; hey -- Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, the French Riviera... what's not to like? So, when the release date for the Blu-Ray version was announced I pre-ordered it immediately, and when I got the opportunity to sit down and watch it a few days after I received it, I was blown away! Maybe it helped that I was watching it on a brand-new LCD TV, but with just a little bit of picture adjustment to get the colors and contrast to match my recollection of what these VistaVision spectaculars looked like on the big screen back in the day, I could have been watching it in a theater -- only the screen wasn't 18 feet tall...<br /><br />Not all Blu-Ray transfers of classic films are as successful as this one, more's the pity, but within my experience, this one sets the standard. If you love this movie, I highly recommend purchasing the Blu-Ray version.

B003Y5HWMW|1.0|The poor rating that I've given this item is in no way reflective of the HBO Series: Game Of Thrones!  The series is fantastic, and as a huge fan of George R. R. Martin's works, I'm thoroughly pleased with what HBO has done with this series!<br /><br />The Blu-Ray edition, however, will make you feel Ned Stark's pain as you spend extremely long periods of time waiting for menus and episodes to launch.  I've often ejected discs from my OPPO BDP-83SE Blu-Ray player, thinking that it had crashed, after trying to launch an episode from the main menu.  Menus are so slow to respond to input, that I often end up deep within a menu that I had no intention of navigating.  I've become accustumed to the lengthy boot times of some Blu-Ray titles, but nothing compares to the discs included in this package.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|I can not tell you how much I love this album.  Definitely one of his best pieces of work.  Love, love, love it...
B004NSULHM|4.0|Admitedly i'm a little late to the debating chamber reviewing this one, even though i streamed it before it was available for purchase last year. I'm actually kind of glad i left it a while though, considering how much the blogosphere and fanzines ferociously analysed this when it came out. Questions like, was it progressive enough? Was is too short? Have they dropped another Kid A on us? Is Thom Yorke gonna do a funny dance video for all of the songs? Okay that last question was just me and it would appear not unfortunately. But on a more serious note, Radiohead have somehow managed to produce their most divisive album of the their 20 something year career and thats quite a feat considering it's Radiohead where talking about.<br /><br />So for those of you who still haven't heard this record, here are a few words from a humble fan who's played this thing several times and is hopefully able to provide some clarity on it's merits, having been far enough removed from all the hype, drama and backlash surrounding it at the time it came out. In a word it's great! Just not Radiohead great if you catch my drift. I don't wanna gush, but these 5 dudes from Oxford, England have made some of the most moving, exciting, resonant and frankly best music of their era.<br /><br />So with those dizzying heights that the band have in my opinion been reaching and maintaining from the Bends all the way up to In Rainbows, it's not suprising this new album is unable continue on what is already one of the most impressive runs of albums in rock music's history. King Of Limbs begins with Bloom a sprawling clatter of electronic loops, percussion, horns and Thom Yorke's ineffably impassioned vocals, it sounds both disconcerting and wonderous. It's a beguiling opener for fans of Radiohead's more left of field fan base (of which i consider myself an honourary member) and it sets the tone for the rest of the album which is almost as equally perplexing and engaging.<br /><br />Morning Mr Magpie and Little By Little are centred around acoustic guitar with the former so stacked with loops, bloops, and warbles it's disorientating but infectious nonetheless. Whereas Little By Little is less cluttered instrumentally, but is riddled with enigmatically dark wordplay and has a peculiar instrumental feel. it's affecting if maybe lacking some of the intriguiging dynamics of it's preceding numbers.<br /><br />Lotus Flower deftly bridges the gap between experimental and accesible, by having a more conventional song structure mixed with trippy electronics and Yorke's trademark falsetto taking centre stage. Codex is a gorgeous ballad not dissimilar to their previous classic Pyrimaid Song with Yorke's gorgeous piano chords and sonorous wail gently washing over you. The Album ends with a bit of whimper with Seperator, sounding unassuming and initially unmemorable but it's still a pretty and satisfying song that improves with repeat listens. There are a couple of tracks i've missed, because i don't like reviews that tell you about every nook and cranny of an album, especially if you're yet to hear it (Give Up The Ghost is heavenly though).<br /><br />I'm under the impression that what i've written so far gives little indication as to why opinions were so polarised with this album and i think it comes back to my point about there being such high expectations for it. it's a very good record made by an undeniably exceptional band, so it's a minor disappointment but only in that context.
0307749495|3.0|The Affair, Lee Childs.<br />This is not Mr. Child's best book but not his worst. I think Jack Reacher is a great character and Mr. childs is a fine writer; my problem with the audio CD version is the speaker. Mr. Dick Hill has a very difficult time trying to read the female characters lines and still keep the plot serious. Maybe the publisher should have employed a female actor to read the lines of the two main female characters. Too much is lost with Mr. Hill's unsuccessful attempt to sound like a woman.
B004NSULHM|4.0|For a long time now i've considered Radiohead a classic band, a band whose consistancy, experimentation and influence in rock music is probably unparrelled by any of their contemporaries. I don't think i'm alone in thinking this and i would also wager the band themselves are aware of the high esteem in whcih they are regarded by fans and critics alike. Bearing that in mind it might suggest there's been a weight of expectation hanging around the bands neck probably post Ok Computer, that maybe they got a little weary of carrying as they stepped into the studio to make their eighth album in their 20 plus year career. If i'm correct, it may account for why King Of Limbs feels less toiled over and maybe a little threadbare in comparison to previous efforts. The band don't seem to be trying to deliver any grandiose statements this time around, they seem to have placed more emphasis on the enjoyment of making the music, having fun in the studio, opposed to meticulously slaving away in an attempt to craft another masterwork. Being a long time fan of the band i for one am happy for them, even if the music isn't quite as earth shatteringly great as a result of this new approach.<br /><br />There are still pleny of reasons to give this a listen though, as the band are so seasoned at what they do even when they're not pushing themselves to the absolute limit they can produce evocative and distinctive music anyway. Take opener Bloom with it's repeated piano loop, sonorous horn arrangement and electronic effects, it all coalesces into an intoxicating wall of sound to provide a great opener. Or the brilliant single Lotus flower which features animated bass lines with Thom's serpentine falsetto married to minimal percussion producing a mesmerizing experience. There's beauty to be found too with the dazzling piano ballad Codex, laced with shimmering strings and another impressive vocal perfomance by Yorke, the song almost feels like a modern day paean. It bears more than a passingresembelance to Amnesiacs Pyrimaid Song but that only slightly takes away from it's allure.<br /><br />Little By Little and morning mr magpie both feature intricate guitar playing and looped percussion, giving them a weightless feel that'll tickle you're pleasure centres but fail to really stimulate them. The vocal harmonies on Give Up The Ghost feel genuinely heart warming and the guitars have an effortless tranquility to them. The final song Seperator has the band sounding liberated with Yorke singing \\"Finally i'm free of all the weight i've been carrying\\" accompanied by a neil young inspired guitar riff. The band have removed the shackles of expectation by releasing this album, It's engaging, quirky and maybe a little slight at just over 37 minutes, It won't cause a seismic shift in the way rock music is made like Kid A did and it's unlikely to be regarded as the greatest album of the decade in 2020 either. But that shouldn't stop these talented musicians from releasing future gems like this, especially if their digging the process of making music now, more than ever before. If King Of Limbs is anything to go by, these guys will still be worth following in the future they just won't be leading the pack anymore thats all.

B005EWDA9M|5.0|My first foray into this author, this is a translation from the original Japanese and has been done wonderfully. Whilst it is very long, the narrative is great, highly descriptive and you can just see every character perfectly in your mind. Having started it I did want to find out the ending and had to read book 3. It is not a thriller so don't expect to be sitting on the edge of your seat, but if you have the time it is quite a different read.<br />Ewan Wilson

This trilogy has definitely become one of my favs!!

B005TBQS0Q|5.0|'Good Morning Vietnam' withstands the test of time and has emerged as a classic of the era.<br /><br />While Robin Williams doesn't really 'do' Adrian Cronauer- who was FAR more conservative in his politics- he channels a nice compromise that suited Hollywood's progressive distaste for the conflict. That dichotomy gives the film it's only weakness. But it is piddling criticism now, given the times.<br /><br />What is does have is sweep, and scope. Director Barry Levinson ('Rain Man') was at the top of his game, and it has the FEEL of Vietnam. Those who were there will tell you that.<br /><br />Not to mention a SUPERB cast with JT Walsh, Bruno Kirby, Noble Willingham and Forrest Whitaker. They get ALL of the Army life right. His scene- where he encounters the truckloads of GI's fresh from Boot camp and on their way to combat- is not only hilarious but will bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened combat veteran.<br /><br />A real treat. The Blu Ray looks and sounds great. Totally worth owning...<br /><br />Don Case

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard made us wait eight years this time. That's almost as long as the nine years between \\"The Future\\" (1992) and \\"Ten New Songs\\"; \\"Dear Heather\\" was released in 2004 and now in 2012 we get \\"Old Ideas\\". With Cohen now 77 years old, the question we all wonder is \\"is this the last we'll hear of dear leonard?\\" Leonard's getting older, there's not much time left, but there's also no sense of urgency from the man, either in his output nor in his delivery. And how can there be?<br />And what kind of excitement is supposed to be generated by an album called \\"Old Ideas\\" anyway? Well, plenty, if the artist is a legend like Cohen (think about it - who else could get away with it anyway?). The songs on \\"Old Ideas\\" are indeed very old-sounding, with Cohen trying perhaps to revisit some of the morbid humor witnessed on albums like \\"The Future\\". The opening song \\"Going Home\\" starts off with the lyrics \\"I love to speak with Leonard\\", it's a languid old tune with some thick background vocalists to do the heavy lifting in the harmony section, while Cohen saunters along. \\"Amen\\" is a strange bit of Tom Waits-ism, with a gravelly-voiced Cohen in full minimalist scope, with light keyboards, swishing drum brushes and some guitar... then the background vocalists come in. A companion piece to \\"Hallelujah\\" maybe? \\"Show Me The Place\\" is a very nice piano piece about slaves. \\"Darkness\\" is probably the coolest song on the album, with Sharon Robinson's wicked synth bass sounds opening it up, with some feathery guitar, and the opening lines \\"I caught the darkness drinking from your cup,\\" repeated twice for effect. \\"I said `is this contagious?' You said `Just drink it up'\\". Great groovy organs, there is a full musical thing happening in this song, great presentation, great production. \\"I thought the past would last me, but the darkness got that too.\\" \\"Anyhow\\" is a strange, spooky song, Leonard talking and talking, with some more great lines through and through. \\"I know you can't forgive me, but forgive me anyhow,\\" \\"I know you have to hate me, but could you hate me less?\\" \\"Crazy To Love You\\" is a song that Cohen co-wrote with Anjani Thomas, that appears on her 2006 album \\"Blue Alert\\", this version is just Cohen's voice accompanied by guitar, it's gorgeous. \\"Come Healing\\" is beautiful female vocals before Cohen's gravelly groan comes in with its careful and steady enunciation. It's like choral music, mainly voices with a bit of organ behind it. Wonderful. \\"Banjo\\" is groovy blues guitar, it is a short song that hops and bops as much as Cohen still can. \\"Lullaby\\" bounces along slightly with still, pleasing rhythms and sounds, it really is a lullaby. \\"The mouse and the cat have fallen in love, they're talking in tongues.\\" \\"Different Sides\\" the album closer, is a long song with full lyrics that comes off like a sinister Nick Cave tune (forgetting, perhaps, that Cohen invented the sinister Nick Cave tune). \\"Both of us say there are laws to obey, but frankly I don't like your tone/You want to change the way I make love, I want to leave it alone.\\" It's a breakup song, I guess, but maybe not a breakup with a woman but a breakup with life itself. Let's see how that turns out for Cohen - we all sincerely wish him longer life and greater happiness.<br /><br />The booklet is nice. Besides reprinting the lyrics, you get a glimpse of the Moleskine notebooks that Cohen uses for his lyrics, along with interesting drawings of Cohen, of nude ladies, of skulls (sex and death), some very nice drawings of pretty girls, of a coffee cup on a table, and various other things.

1594744769|4.0|Ransom Riggs gives us this fantasy story of Jacob Portman, a sixteen-year-old who adores his grandfather, and, sadly, sees his grandfather killed by a monster.<br /><br />Jacob learns a great deal about his beloved grandfather's past.  He knows that, as a Polish child during World War II, his grandfather was sent away to a children's home in a remote part of Wales, but he doesn't know the whole story about the home until he sees some old photos of his grandfather and the other residents of the home and then journeys to Wales.<br /><br />There is more to this children's home, run by a Miss Peregrine, than it seems - much more.  Were the children in this home because of World War II, or were they there because each one of them had special powers?  Does Jacob have any of these powers, too?<br /><br />I was absorbed in Jacob's quest to find out more about his grandfather and himself - and wondered whether all of them would be locked into a particular day in time.  I could clearly see each of the children of the home, according to his/her particular gifts.  The photos also help us see who's who and what's happening.<br /><br />There are a few weak spots that prevent me from giving this book a 5 rating, primarily the fact that the pace is a little uneven. Some parts move too quickly, and others a little too slowly.<br /><br />This is a peculiar book about peculiar children which I give a high 4-star rating.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|Matt King (George Clooney) is a wealthy land-owner in Hawaii, approaching a big land-sale deal.  At the same time, Matt receives word that his comatose wife has no hope of survival, and that by her own instructions, the plug is to be pulled.  Matt finds himself the guardian of a rebellious ten-year-old daughter (Amara Miller), and seeks out his other daughter, an equally rebellious teenager (Shailene Woodley).  The latter informs Matt that his wife was cheating on him, and while on a journey to inform her family of what is happening, Matt decides to seek out this other man.<br /><br />It's a rather complex plot, actually, layered with deep character development and details.  Director/screenwriter Alexander Payne holds everything together marvelously; this is a beautifully crafted, beautifully shot film.  What truly breathes life into THE DESCENDANTS, however, is Payne's way with his actors.  The film rests squarely on the shoulders of George Clooney; while at times ripping off his mannerisms from UP IN THE AIR (the narration doesn't help), Clooney ultimately delivers a very nuanced, very natural performance that probably deserved the 2012 Best Acting Oscar (but we all knew Jean Dujardin would win, didn't we?  Yes, we did.)  Woodley matches Clooney step-for-step, in what will be regarded as her breakthrough performance.  Miller also gives a solid performance (I've ranted about child actors before; there's no need to rant about Miller).  Robert Forster gives a memorable performance at Matt's father-in-law, while Matthew Lillard takes a nice dramatic turn as \\"the other man\\" (with Judy Greer as his wife).  Nick Krause provides some fantastic comedic moments as Sid, a teenage suitor.<br /><br />And that's the great thing about THE DESCENDANTS: even at its darkest, saddest moments, it doesn't forget to be funny.  Because humor can be found anywhere, and Payne and company aren't afraid to show you.  Some viewers may be put off by the fact that a movie about a family coping with death can be so funny in spots; but such is life.  Payne has found the perfect material, and the perfect cast, to create a tale of humor and tragedy.  It doesn't hurt that this is, quite simply, an amazing film.with death can be so funny in spots; but such is life.

B007HJ91HU|3.0|I saw and LOVED the original. When I saw the preview for this movie, I nearly wanted to rip my eyes out! I am hoping that they did NOT butcher the original just to make a quick buck. Footloose is almost, not quite but almost, on a level with Grease NOT Grease 2 btw. However, the original Footloose had soooo much dancing, great moves, self expression, and GREAT songs that all ages could enjoy. I am curious to see the remake, HOWEVER, if the preview is actually how the movie will be...I will give a bad review...a very bad review. So if you're like me and loved the freedom of expression and originality that the original footloose brought...watch the preview because I'mma wait a bit. So keep your eyes pealed for my updated review AFTER I watch and hope for the best =)<br /><br />Update: All in all, very similar to the original. It is good for a one time watch and the songs have been re-made. If you really LOVED the original, you probably won't like this. Again, very similar to the original. I would say it's an updated original that you can watch with your kids and they will better relate to the characters.

1400032717|5.0|By Sophia<br />The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon is about a fifteen year old boy named Christopher Francis Boone who has autism.  He lives in Swindon with his father and pet rat, Toby. One night Christopher finds his neighbor's poodle dead.  He decides to thoroughly investigate in order to find out who killed the dog, Wellington.  His personality unravels as he tries to solve the mystery. Christopher was so fixated during the process; he discovers dark secrets that lead him to an unexpected journey to London all by himself.  He solves more than just the mystery he set out for.<br /><br />Mark Haddon easily reveals the complex mind of a quirky teenage boy with autism.  Haddon's writing style and vocabulary were able to capture the unique mind of Christopher by stressing on specific details and factoids and how it would digress from the story flow.  It was cleverly done because it enabled a reader to gain a better sense of Christopher's character.  There may be a tendency to encounter information overload as one reads the book due to the various \\"off-topics\\" that are expounded on.  One can easily skip a few paragraphs without losing the flow of the story.  Despite Haddon's writing style that goes off tangent, he manages to encapsulate the essence of the story leaving the reader spellbound.<br /><br />This breath-taking book is worth five stars because I believed Christopher.  Haddon had brought me into the story. I was intrigued by the thoughts a boy with autism had.  I believed him and the story.  I felt the details that were going in Christopher's thoughts. I finally understood the mind of a boy with autism, the math, the flow charts, the science, and the photographic memory, and how Christopher would change the topic by connecting all his knowledge from a small idea.  I was in the story, watching Christopher go through his adventure alone.
B004P8JPS6|2.0|I have been a Lee Child fan for years and have read all of his books. I felt this book was not in keeping with most of the \\"Reacher\\" books perhaps because it is set at a time that had passed long ago in Reacher's literary existence and therefore loses relevance. Reacher is a principled man but somehow that was not so prevalent in this book. I saw this as an attempt by Mr Child to keep his protagonist alive and \\"young\\" and to pave the way for other books about Reacher written in a similar retrospective way.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved It! One of the best series ever!! Get it... Christian is so damaged and innocent Ana come together for a great read.  Love can conquer all!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ok...I get it...his fingers are long!  And what about all the \\"hitching\\" breaths, \\"pursed\\" lips, and clambering?  The repetitive words and phrases are distracting. My conclusion...erotica has an untapped (no pun intended) market and this book, as weak as it is, has broken through a barrier to the mainstream.  It certainly didn't take much in the way of writing skill, but as with porn videos it's not the writing we're worried about! I have just one word for E.L. James...synonyms!
B001EOOQEM|1.0|This album is a seminal youth album for me, probably in my top 10 albums of all time.  With this disclaimer out of the way, calling this cd release some kind of a 2008 remaster is some kind of a joke, if not outright fraud.  This is an original issue CD, from back in the day when all CDs sounded horrible.  If you have a decent audio rig, and you expect good if not great sound from this CD, you will be severely disappointed if you purchase it.

B0060Q962Q|5.0|I cannot get enough of this game.  just like the popular connect 4 board game except with 3 themes each with some pretty cool sound tracks.  the games looks really sharp and the sound coming out of the speakers is very good hence the large size of the app.  regarding the permissions to access the Internet,  it appears to need this to view other titles by this dev.  regardless, I highly recommend this game.

0385534639|5.0|The title of my review is meant to convey one main thing about Ms. Morgenstern's 'The Night Circus': some readers will absolutely adore it, but others should steer clear of it. Like quality wine and chocolate, this kind of book is a rare and magnificent treat now and then, but in no way should it be considered to represent a staple of literature.<br /><br />I read this book and was genuinely delighted with it, for many of the reasons listed by other five-star reviewers: chief among them is without doubt the exquisite detail in the descriptions of the circus, its wonders, and the events surrounding it.<br /><br />I read many negative reviews objecting to the descriptions of clothing and food and parties; I can respect that objection, to be honest, while not sharing it. I thoroughly enjoyed the lyrical pictures the author painted of rich textures and vivid colors, although I recognize that many readers would not at all share my enjoyment.<br /><br />When I came here to review this book and noticed the number of one-star reviews, I was frankly astonished and had to know what could so displease a reader. Having read the one-star reviews, I have to say that most of their complaints are perfectly legitimate on a personal, subjective basis.<br /><br />I would take issue with the bad reviews regarding the grammar and syntax Ms Morgenstern uses. I can see how it sounds ludicrously stilted and even uneducated when read a certain way; however, I found the simplicity of the text refreshing, especially in considering the richness of the descriptive prose. A lot really does depend on *how* a book - particularly a fantastical fiction such as this - is read.<br /><br />The complaints about shallow characters I can likewise understand. I, however, sometimes prefer characters whose intricacies are implied or hinted rather than explained in detail. This kind of book is designed, in my opinion, to stimulate the imaginative faculties in the reader's mind; leaving many aspects half-obscured is for me a very effective way to accomplish that goal. I can't actually defend Celia's or Marco's character based on the text as being other than shallow; the depths are only implied in the story itself, not plumbed. However, I can easily imagine what is happening in - for instance - Celia's mind as a woman, having been given a clear picture of what happened to her as a child. Her psyche expresses itself in her actions (or lack thereof), but to me this does not indicate an impoverished character. That said, I can well see how it would for other readers. The same applies to Marco and Tsukiko (about whom I particularly enjoyed speculating) and any other characters who caught my fancy.<br /><br />While I'm on characterization, I would like to say that I particularly enjoyed the fact that the characters were *not* black and white, in stark contrast to their circus. I found that to be a clever literary device, personally. The fact that Marco is at times not even close to heroic in his actions makes him more realistic to me; less of a caricature. Since I'm fed up with overdrawn exaggerations of Good and Evil in literary characters, that suits me fine.<br /><br />I do agree completely with those reviewers who were disappointed and even angry about having been misled by the advertising of this book; to call it a 'Duel to the Death' between two magicians is to set up any reader expecting that for total disillusionment. I blame marketing for that, rather than the author; it was not a deadly duel of magic, it was a sensuous, soft, sumptuous love story full of light and darkness, much like the circus.<br /><br />In short, I would say that this book is perhaps more than usually difficult to categorize because its components are so subjective. The very things I and many others loved about this book are things some other readers have hated, and will continue to hate. I went into this book with zero expectations, not having read any hype, simply because it was recommended to me as part of a genre I've recently become interested in. That's what I would advise any prospective reader: ignore the marketing and don't go into the book with any particular expectations.<br /><br />So although I can reiterate that I honestly love this book, and it's on my top ten list, I canNOT honestly recommend it for all other readers. I look forward to reading more work from this author.e as part of a genre I've recently become interested in. That's what I would advise any prospective reader: ignore the marketing and don't go into the book with any particular expectations.<br /><br />So although I can reiterate that I honestly love this book, and it's on my top ten list, I canNOT honestly recommend it for all other readers.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|This lil sharpener actually works great for sharpening up my machetes. And The diamond rod works well enough on serrations. Though it does kind of dull my thin bladed folding knives... For all who's Diamond rod for sharpening serrations have broken off...it's an 8 dollar pocket sharpener and the rod is basically hard plastic. You don't need alot of pressure when using the rod. And try a squirt of WD40 in the rod's hinge and work it in there. It is kind of useful for the price.

B004T4KQJS|3.0|It's hard for me to rate this book, as I found I was unable to understand a considerable amount of it. The parts I did understand were fascinating, but later in the book I was completely lost as to what the author is trying to explain. I found myself reading through paragraph after confusing paragraph just to find out what his conclusion was. So I'd say if you are an armchair scientist (like myself), you will probably not get as much enjoyment out of it as someone who understands particle physics, quantum mechanics, etc. So see my three stars as a rating for the average person wanting to learn more about the universe and not someone well versed in the topics discussed in the book.

I found A Discover of Witches to be one of the more engaging reads I've had in a long time.  Nothing about it is fantastically original, but all of it is interesting, well executed, and well researched.  Looking forward to the next installment!

Had to sign up to two or more different places in order to download the digital copy. its a waist of time. Can easly just enter a code in itunes download and watch it. No signing up cause i already have it installed. if you want it for the movie just get the movie the ultraviolet is a waist of time. Wish i knew more about it before i bought it.

B001F8W400|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, and I loved every minute of it! I wanted to own this movie so badly, but I wanted to wait until the price went down a bit. When I saw the opportunity that Amazon gave I couldn't resist! Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />This is a great movie about a kid named Speed Racer. He is a very talented race car driver who is nearly impossible to stop. One thing that makes this movie intriguing is that amount of races that one sees. They see four races altogether, and you see two of them to their full completion (one of them is a cross-country race). One thing that I didn't like about the movie \\"Cars\\" was that there was two races total: one at the very beginning, and one at the very end. That was it. In here, there is way more action.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Save your money from buying the normal edition and spend a little more and get this extended edition, you will not be sorry!
0307959856|3.0|I sm such a fan of P.D. James that I rarely read a content summary before buying any new book she writes. BUT I do not enjoy Jane Austen at all, which has created some dissappointment for me with this book.<br />\\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" was excruciating at first, (although it was a good sleep aid at bedtime) as characters were developed, and we learned of centuries-old feuds among wealthy aristocratic families.  I must confess that as I plod on, the plot is becoming more interesting (murder hath been done), and I am falling asleep later.<br />For Jane Austen fans, who include most of my best friends, this should be a wonderful romp of crime and fainting damsels.<br />As for me, henceforth I pledge to read book descriptions of even my most favorite authors.  Note to PD: please, oh please, let's get back to this century, and share with your adorng fans your endless wealth of forensic expertise!

0061452068|5.0|People in America do not understand what it means to live in a country ruled by planning. The experience here can be encapsulated by what is known as the \\"Submerged State\\" rather than the experience of Britain as a centrally planned economy during the war years of 1939-1945 and for a long time afterwards. I was born in what we Brits used to refer to as the nanny state, a NHS midwife attended my mother at my birth, my vaccinations were given at an NHS clinic, I went to a State financed Grammar Scool and eventually went to work in a government department. Private enterprises were a larger part of the economy then but the government controlled the major industries.<br /><br />Whilst I was at my junior school, there was a scheme where children could buy from a selection of books every month or two from a list to help encourage reading, and for me it opened up a whole new world by encouraging me to visit the library which I did every night as it was between school and home. A book by Paul Erhlich[[ASIN:1568495870 The Population Bomb]] brought me my first ephiphanic moment, that of seeing the world become desolate through overpopulation, a point reinforced by some science fiction stories I was reading at the time. From there I graduated to the methods of dealing with such problems, remarkably similar to those advocated by environmentalists today, global central planning, draconian laws etc.<br /><br />Amazingly this stance remained with me for some years until I shook off it's shackles. The impetus for this began with an apparently separate set of events which began in the Bay Area of San Francisco and it's environs from about 1966 onwards. Again, this is another story in itself.<br /><br />During the intermittent years until now much of the disaster movie scenarios set out in that book and it's ilk have not come to pass. Central planning has been a demonstrable failure, the population has continued to grow andthe bleak fortunes which have been predicted have not come to pass. Juian Simon[[ASIN:155786585X The State of Humanity]] a maverick economist, brought a sense of balance to the debate with his expositions of how predictions of doom and gloom were completely wrong, famously winning a bet with Ehrlich about one of that author's self-selected predictions.<br /><br />Matt Ridley has attracted much opprobrium for his work[[ASIN:0255363451 Down to Earth : Contrarian View of Envir (Studies on the Environment)]] due primarily to his opposition to many central tenents of modern day environmentalism. Indeed this work has been bashed considerably since it's publication but clearer heads must examine the text.<br /><br />The tone of this book is unabashedly optimistic although that should be qualified by the fact that he is not glorifying the effects of disasters. He shows how, throughout history, the tendency of people to trade with one another has proved benefial to all without any individual intent to provide collective benefits. Consistently he shows how exchange, leads to prosperity for all without any collective central organisation but how freeloaders extract gains from trade to build institutions which enrich themselves and impoverish the society that allowed them to gain in the first place. Adam Ferguson [[ASIN:1142792455 Principles of Moral and Political Science: Being Chiefly a Retrospect of Lectures Delivered in the College of Edinburgh, Volume 1]] expressed this process in a simple phrase, \\"Every step and every movement of the multitude, even in what are termed enlightened ages, are made with equal blindness to the future; and nations stumble upon establishments, which are indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human design.<br /><br />Ridley deftly traces the development of human progress throughout thousands of years but confronts the challenges thrown at his arguement by those who are mainly ideologically opposed to him.<br />He challenges the orthodoxy which envisages a dark Hobbesian future say of a Solyent Green society, and trusts in the ingenuity which is bound structurally into the forces of exchange. Like Paul Ormerod [[ASIN:0470089199 Why Most Things Fail: Evolution, Extinction and Economics]] in another context Ridley forsees nothing but good coming from the system which human beings unfailing look for the downside.<br /><br />This book makes for thrilling reading in a boy's own sort of a way, with thrills and spills, unexpected twists and turns and a sort of one bound and he was free type of ending. It is a book which provides engrossing reading which you will not want to put down even if you disagree with the author because you want to know, nay need to know, what comes next.

1400153786|3.0|There's enough on here about the content of Dr. Dawkins' work so I'll address the format of the audio version. It comes in a DVD-like case, and the unabridged audio is on 2 MP3 disks. My car and home stereo do not play MP3 disks. I bought this to listen in the car. Now I'll have to download the entire thing and put it on my iPod (14 hours takes up a lot of space). Very inconvenient. Didn't have this trouble with \\"The Greatest Show on Earth.\\" Perhaps there should be an option of disks and MP3s so the listener can choose.<br /><br />Again, this review is for the format.

B005723JSQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Sophie Kinsella for a long time, but I must say this is my favorite of hers.  She always has the outlandish scenarios that involve a lot of fibbing and somehow miraculously end up working out perfectly in the end - a little unbelievable, sure, but isn't that why we read fiction?  This one is pretty unbelievable too, and the premise is hard for me to explain to friends, but I thought it was very clever and I laughed throughout the entire thing.  Only complaint is that on a Kindle version, all the little footnotes are much slower to read because you have to cursor to it and click to follow the link each time, instead of just being able to look at the bottom of the page.  But they were worth it!  Definitely recommend to anyone who enjoys a good chick lit.

In some Dutch quality newspapers this book was reviewed very positively, and because I am very interested in any book about the working of the brain, I decided to use it. I think that it is not advisable for some people to read it; some people are not capable of changing their views about themselves, and most of them surely must. More flexible thinkers should read this book. You can learn a lot about yourself and other people by reading this book! You also know, now, how I think about myself ;-)

B0029NY9YO|5.0|When one is very young, the world is a vibrant, thrilling place filled with excitement and wonder. So too are the fictional worlds one reads about in books or watches in movies. But as we grow older and more jaded, the color and wonder begin to fade. Things begin to look the same, and the world becomes a little more gray and a little less exciting. That view carries over into our entertainments, which have to try harder and harder--to be bigger, louder, and more extreme--to even get our attention. We develop a \\"been there, done that,\\" mentality, which is why we look back at the things we discovered in our youth with such affectionate nostalgia. It's why the thirty-something Star Wars fans panned the prequel trilogy and still hold the original trilogy as the Holy Grail. They still watch the originals with the eyes of their childhood. If they somehow had their memories erased and watched the older films \\"for the first time\\" with adult eyes, they would, while perhaps still enjoying them, find them somewhat juvenile and shallow, and certainly not the masterpieces they remember.<br /><br />All of this is to simply say that I, as an adult, find it difficult to get truly excited about things. I enjoy reading and I enjoy cinema, but the pleasure I usually get from these endeavors is mild and fleeting. I rarely experience the obsessive anticipation for a film that I did while waiting for The Empire Strikes Back when I was ten years old, or even the 1989 Batman film when I was nineteen. I won't generally keep thinking about a movie or book for long after it's over, pining to go back and see or read it again so I can relive the experience. I think the last time I had such an experience was when The Lord of the Rings films came out. I had anticipated their release for years, because the books had been among my favorites since I was twelve. I was like a child again, full of wonder and enthusiasm. I love Batman and anticipated The Dark Knight greatly (and was not disappointed), but it wasn't the same.<br /><br />Now a film has come around that I have waited years to see. I feel like a little kid again (although I do NOT recommend it for actual kids!) when I watch it or even when I think about it. It sticks with me and I can't get it out of my head or my heart. That film is Watchmen.<br /><br />Now, I will admit I do not come to the film fresh. Like those Star Wars fans I mentioned before, my views are necessarily colored by the memories of my youth. I discovered Watchmen when it first appeared as a monthly, twelve issue comic book series released in 1986-1987. I had never read anything like it. It took the concept of superheroes and turned it on its ear. It addressed complex world issues, such as the then-current cold war and the threat of nuclear annihilation. It philosophically discussed the nature of mankind. And the ending presented a moral dilemma that made you second-guess who was the hero and who was the villain. Could a completely horrible act be condoned if it brought about a greatly desired result? Does the end justify the means? If you read the ending of Watchmen and didn't come away questioning everything you believed about right and wrong, you missed the whole point.<br /><br />Watchmen, by writer Alan Moore and artist David Gibbons, is a comic book (or, as the pretentious would call it, a graphic novel). It is also serious literature. It was the first comic book to win a prestigious Hugo Award, and it has been named one of Time Magazine's top 100 novels from 1923 to the present. It certainly has its detractors--those who refuse to acknowledge that the comic book form can rise above its humble roots, those who expect and want a straight-forward, action packed superhero story, and those who simply don't get it--but for the most part it is acclaimed as a masterwork.<br /><br />Now, as I said, I can't completely separate myself from my knowledge of the comic book while watching the film. I can't discuss it from the point of view of the uninitiated. I hope the movie plays well for people who have never heard of Watchmen before, but I can't know for sure. All I know is that to me, it was absolutely amazing. I have already seen it twice, and I know in the weeks to come I will see it several more times.<br /><br />Like the book, the film takes place in 1985 in the midst of cold war paranoia. But it is a very different 1985 then the one we remember, mostly because of the existence of \\"costumed adventurers,\\" or superheroes. These heroes, with one exception, have no superhuman abilities; they are simply men and women who have trained their bodies to physical perfection in pursuit of their chosen vocation. They are very flawed individuals, and some take to the streets in their outrageous costumes and masks for reasons less noble than fighting crime: thrills, sexual gratification, psychopathic compulsions, or the desire to scribe their own twisted morality on the world. However, despite these flaws, or perhaps because of them, deep in their hearts they truly do want to make the world a better place.<br /><br />As I said, the existence of these costumed heroes has significantly changed the world from the one we live in. The greatest bringer of change is Dr. Manhattan, the only one with actual super powers. Due to a strange accident in a science lab, physicist Dr. Jon Osterman was transformed into an almost all-powerful entity, capable of manipulating matter, teleporting, and unleashing destructive energy. He seems to have no limitations and is virtually indestructible. Due to his intervention, America won the Vietnam War. This victory allowed President Nixon to repeal the Twenty-second Amendment so he could run for more than two terms. By1985, Nixon is in his fifth term as president. A law passed in 1977 has outlawed superheroes, except those sponsored by and working for the federal government. Dr. Manhattan and an amoral, violent anti-hero called the Comedian are the only two who choose to work for the U.S.<br /><br />While the Comedian performs covert military operations for the government, Dr. Manhattan is the crux of America's military superiority. The threat of his power is what keeps the USSR from attacking the United States. However, experts believe that the Soviet Union will not be cowed forever, and that they will inevitably launch a nuclear assault. Dr. Manhattan might be able to stop ninety-nine percent of Russia's missiles, but the one percent that gets through will certainly be enough to destroy the country. Nixon's finger is on the button of America's own nuclear arsenal, contemplating a pre-emptive strike.<br /><br />It is difficult to remember nowadays (and impossible for young people who weren't there) the mortal terror many of us felt at the near-certainty (in our minds) of nuclear war--of mutually assured destruction. But to truly \\"get\\" Watchmen, you have to put yourself in that frame of mind. Today our fears revolve around terrorism. Back then, we truly feared the end of the world. Perhaps we still do, but the reasons are very different.<br /><br />Amidst these times of global tension and paranoia, the Comedian is murdered. Rorschach, a hero who refused to retire in 1977 and now operates illegally, investigates. Rorschach is an obsessive man with a code of moral absolutism, in which good and evil are strictly defined. Everything is black and white; there is never any gray. He also may very well be a sociopath. As Rorschach investigates the murder, he develops the theory that there may be a \\"mask killer,\\" someone who is out to eliminate costumed heroes. He proceeds to warn the remaining heroes that someone is out to kill them.<br /><br />On the most superficial level, Watchmen is a murder mystery. The larger plot becomes evident as Rorschach continues his investigation. There are many digressions and flashbacks, fleshing out the world and the lives of these strange heroes. Some movie goers may be put off by these digressions, thinking they areunnecessary or that they make the movie \\"slow.\\" Certainly, this film advances at its own, leisurely pace, but these digressions are character studies which delve into the nature of humanity, which is one of the major themes of Watchmen. Why is Rorschach the man he is? You have to learn his tragic history to know. How did Dr. Manhattan get his powers, and why is he becoming detached from humanity? A lengthy flashback will tell you.<br /><br />The remaining Watchmen are soon drawn into Rorschach's investigation. Nite Owl, or Dan Dreiburg, is the closest thing we get to a traditional superhero. He is mostly motivated by fighting crime and doing good, but there is an element of thrill-seeking (and a kinky fascination with playing dress-up) that motivates him as well. He uses advanced technology in his battle against wrong-doers, the most spectacular toy in his arsenal being his flying owl-ship. Silk Specter, or Laurie Jupiter (Juspeczyk in the comic), is a sexy, skilled fighter. She was pressured into becoming a costumed hero by her mother Sally, who was also known as the Silk Specter in her youth. Laurie, who is in a relationship with Dr. Manhattan, has some serious mommy issues to work through. Finally, there is Adrian Veidt, or Ozymandias, who has physically perfected both his body and mind. He is known as the world's smartest man, and, working with Dr. Manhattan, is nearing a solution to the world's energy problems. He is creating a free, renewable source of energy based on Manhattan's powers, which is sure to enrage the pioneers of industry whose bread and butter is the sale of fossil fuels and nuclear power.<br /><br />In the comic, we get to know each of these characters very well. Each of them gets a full issue to examine their... um... issues... as well as their back-stories. In the movie we see far less of this, but we still get significant glimpses of the histories of the Comedian, Dr. Manhattan, and Rorschach. Sadly, Veidt, a pivotal character in both book and film, does not get much screen time.<br /><br />Critics have been split over the success of this film. The website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 65% on the \\"Tomatoemeter,\\" which means 65% of the reviews they have tallied are generally positive. A score of 60% or higher qualifies a film as \\"fresh,\\" while scores lower than this give a film a \\"rotten\\" designation.<br /><br />Many critics have complained that some of the acting is far below par. Almost universally panned is Malin Akerman as Laurie. For the life of me, I cannot understand why. The character is not written the same in the script as she is in the comic, but Akerman does a fine job with the material she is given. In one scene in particular, where she experiences a devastating revelation about her past, she emotes powerfully the grief and despair I would expect the character to feel. I agree with most critics, though, that standout performances include Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian. These are, in my opinion, the most meaty roles, and the actors do them justice.<br /><br />Since it is a murder mystery, a cold war tale, a philosophical exploration, and a character study, there is not much action in the comic. The film is short on action as well, although what's there is very intense, very violent, and very exciting. If you are only interested in action, you might want to skip this movie. You might also want to skip it if graphic violence disturbs you. Some of the fighting is brutal. Blood flies and bones break. There is one very disturbing scene of an attempted, but interrupted, rape. It is ugly and brutal, but necessary to the plot.<br /><br />Much ado has been made about Dr. Manhattan's nudity in the film, but if you are at all mature and can handle the sight of a penis, it is much ado about nothing. Manhattan, having no physical need for clothing and a receding connection to humanity and its mores, does not see the need to cover himself. It is essential to his character and representative of his estrangement from the human condition. The attention many critics and movie goers have given to his nudity is both sophomoric and unwarranted. There is so much wonder to look at on the screen at any given time as to make the appearance of a blue, CGI penis negligible. All I can say is, \\"grow up.\\"<br /><br />Some are disturbed by the fact that there's also some near-pornographic sex in the film. Now, I think it could have been done more tastefully, but the sex is important to the story, especially as it deals with some of Dan Dreiburg's hang-ups. Frankly, this is a movie for adults with adult themes and ideas, so the intended audience should not be bothered by a little romp in the sack (or on an owl-ship). Plus, I wouldn't give up the opportunity to see Malin Akerman's tits for nothin'.<br /><br />A major criticism of the film has been that the viewer develops little emotional attachment to the characters. Maybe it's my recollection of my affection for these characters in the novel, but I truly feel for each and every one of them while watching the movie. The Comedian is an amoral murderer, but he is also a sad, lonely man who uncovers a horrible plot and is killed for it. Rorschach is a psychopath, but his terrible past inspires pity and understanding. Laurie is tormented both by her mother's control over her destiny and her inability to face the truth about her past. Dr. Manhattan is both more and less than human, and far sadder about that fact than he lets on. Dan is lonely and purposeless, unable to feel alive unless he is wearing a costume. And Adrian Veidt, as the world's smartest (and probably richest) man must make decisions that torment him and perhaps drive him over the edge of sanity.<br /><br />The ending of the movie diverges from the book in a significant way. However, the core theme remains. I said earlier that, at the end, the characters face a nearly unthinkable moral dilemma. The \\"villain\\" of the film has, by his actions, however heinous and insane, done a greatly desirable thing that will benefit humanity. Should his crimes be exposed, allowing evil to be punished, when to do so would reverse the good that his evil actions have accomplished? By Rorschach's code of black and white, absolutely. But the others--and the viewers--may have a different opinion. Or maybe not. The beauty of Alan Moore's story is that it doesn't decide for us. We decide. If we can.<br /><br />Since the end plays out differently in the movie, a wonderful, life-affirming scene from the book is removed. It is a beautiful moment that moves me to tears every time I read it. Without it, the ending of the film comes off as much darker. Still, the movie's ending works and is powerful in its own right. I just wish one of my favorite scenes from the book made it to the screen intact. This is the only real complaint I have with the movie, and it is a very small one.<br /><br />Visually, the film is dark but beautiful. Director Zack Snyder and his crew of mad geniuses have painted a stylized, gutter-chic tapestry of an alternate New York, and the special effects are out of this world (sometimes literally, as part of the movie takes place on Mars). The costumes are top-notch, as are the sets, both real and CGI. Dr. Manhattan is a triumph of animation. Even if you don't like the film's story or characters, you may still appreciate it as a visual masterpiece.<br /><br />The final point I want to make is that this is not a traditional superhero movie, and it is absolutely NOT for kids. It is violent and sometimes disturbing, and it contains nudity and explicit sex. It's rated R for a reason, folks. I would say if your kids are at least 14 or 15 and pretty mature, take them to see it. Younger or immature kids... leave them at home! They will be disturbed by some parts and bored to tears by others, and they certainly won't understand it.<br /><br />The opinions of naysayers notwithstanding, this is a deep, emotional workand a faithful adaptation of the comic book. Much of the richness of the comic is missing, but such loss is unavoidable when condensing a lengthy work to a two-and-a-half hour film. Watching it, I relived the joy and excitement I was able to feel more often when I was young. Seeing one of my favorite stories play out on screen was an amazing experience, and Snyder has my eternal thanks for having the guts to make this film and do it right.and film, does not get much screen time.<br /><br />Critics have been split over the success of this film.

B004EPZ07U|5.0|This movie is an excellent choice of entertainment no matter if you´re not fan of the comics, recommended for its extraordinary special effects.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Took about a quarter of the book for me to get hooked, long, sort-of complictaed beginning, but once one of the main incidents occured, I was hooked in a big way!  Rooting for the main title character and will be continuing the series!
B000IONJJ2|5.0|\\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" is considered a classic British comedy with American stars like Jamie Lee Curtis and Kevin Kline as Wanda and Otto, two American con-artists, along with British actors and Monty Python alums, John Cleese, and Michael Palin. Cleese played British barrister, Archie Leach, who is enticed by Wanda Gurwitz. Wanda and Otto have even their partners conned into thinking that they're brother and sister as well. Michael Palin played stuttering Ken whose main mission is to off Ms. Coady played by the wonderful actress, Patricia Hayes. The film was written, produced, and co-directed by John Cleese and the late Charles Crichton.<br /><br />Anyway, the cast is first rate and the writing as well. The direction is brilliant. Of course, BAFTAs went to John Cleese (lead actor) and Michael Palin (supporting actor) and an Academy Award for Actor in a Supporting Role to Kevin Kline's unforgettable performance as Otto. In my opinion, Kline steals the film most of the time but they're all scene stealers. Kline's Otto believes he's smarter than everybody else especially the British. Jamie Lee Curtis is also unforgettable and believable as the woman who is crossing everybody else in the film for the jewels.<br /><br />The first CD is the film. The second CD is the special features which include the making of the film; a message from John Cleese when the film was released; Robert Powell exploring the locations where the film was shot; the inception and completion of the film; alternate and deleted scenes with John Cleese pointing them out. I would have liked to have seen the Academy Awards clips when Kevin Kline won and accepted his award.

B004RJMUJO|4.0|Well to address everything,  yes the update erases your sensei swag, but it did so,  so it can add more beach of the peach and POMEGRANATE. Yes android finally has the pomegranate, bad thing that it double the space from 10-11 to 25-26.  Although if moved to sd card it's 1 or 2 mb more.<br />Finally yes they added things like rewards from a rewards service, but you don't have to accept that. So if you have a sensible mind, you'll be able to enjoy the updated version.

B003UESJ9M|5.0|I am late in finally seeing this movie (I have a 4 year old). It is so good and so is the music! Garrett Hedlund is AMAZING and made this one of my favorite movies ever! Get it and then get both soundtracks!!

B005529BDK|5.0|Played this on both my old Droid Incredible with both Froyo and Gingerbread as well as on my new Droid Incredible 2 with Gingerbread & I absolutely LOVE it! It's somewhat along the lines of a ball drop game mixed with a shoot the balloon game, but with a twist. The balls drop from the top of the screen and you aim your ball from the bottom to try to line it up with similarly colored balls, 3 in a row, either across or up & down. The difference is you can touch the balls that drop & switch them to their alternate color to help you. It's just that little extra twist that keeps this from being yet another boring, same old, same old game! Highly recommend this game for all ages & WELL worth $1.99!!!
B00002SSKI|5.0|When we watched this movie as teenagers (15) we loved it, but when we got together later on after we graduated and started living our lives we realized this was US!(We are now in our late 20's early 30's) Not only us, but every friendship girls have. It is a wonderful movie and I recommend this to everyone!

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I bought these headphones expecting amazing sound quality, I got that. What I didn't get was a decent headset. The design of the headphones were made to fold and sit on your chest. I did this a lot and after two weeks, snap. They broke. It still works and I taped it but do not buy these expecting a durable headset. It is made of cheap plastic.
0307956350|3.0|I was intrigued by the book description and the high praise from Patricia Cornwell (one of my favorite authors) however this book falls short of its mark.  While the writing seemed to improve in later chapters I was still unimpressed.  There didn't seem to be a good flow to the story and it jumped around from present to past without any rhyme or reason.  However, there were enough plot twists to hold my interest  through the whole book.  I would suggest checking this book out of the library or borrowing it from a friend.  It was a decent read but not worth spending money on.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|Entertaining way to kill a few minutes.  The fair number of complaints from people who don't know what they're talking about shouldn't turn anyone off from this.

0060723513|5.0|In our culture, we often get so caught up in the \\"now\\" of things or immediate gratification.  We always seem to be in such a hurry to live life that we miss what matters most.  Reading this book made me slow down and appreciate through the eyes of another culture and see how amazing our earth (and life) is.  I could see the superficiality of the way we live in this fast paced society.  Not that everything is bad, but there is so much to be enjoyed and appreciated.  I'm excited to have another cultures opinion on life.  I'm glad to see that joy can be gotten from the most basic things in life.  I'm also glad to see a culture that so fully relies on \\"divine oneness\\" (or God) for their daily existence. They don't go to chuch every Sunday, nor is it discussed as a religion.  It simply is their fundamental daily understanding and use of their faith that keeps them strong.  Except for some of the things this writer had to eat on the walk about, I think a walk about for each of us could center us and help us to reprioritise our perception of life and our way we choose to live it.  I'm so glad I had the opportunity to read this book.
0321344758|5.0|Krug doesn't beat around the bush with this read. He covers a huge range of content, all written in a to the point, even humorous way.

B004A7OQKY|5.0|Yes, the lighting is bad and the production quality is low but that doesn't stop this from being a great workout video, I really loved that there were water breaks built in. I wish the beginning had a \\"you will need these items for the workout\\" type deal.  I had to pause to get somethings that I would have liked to collect before starting but it really wasn't that inconvenient. There's an abundance of prenatal yoga videos out there and I love yoga but really, I can only do so much. Also, it's hard to find a good workout for pregnant ladies that isn't all \\"baby this, baby that and do it for your baby\\". If you really want to sweat and feel like you've done a solid workout, give this video a try.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|It takes discipline to sit and watch this video in its entirety. It moved very slowly and the \\"Blair Witch Style\\" video quality was to say the least, annoying.

B005VR9328|5.0|The Roots constantly evolve their beats & lyrics and with every evolution I am Hooked even more. Every change they have made has been for the better. This latest album is more like a fine piece of Art than any other album they've released. The Perfect example of this new artwork is the track titled \\"Lighthouse\\" if you stop for just one minute and focus on the lyrics of this track you will be inspired.<br /><br />Only one other band that evolves their music has captivated me like the Roots have and that band is Radiohead. Yeah I know you are probably thinking \\"How can you compare the two? They are from two different galaxies.\\" Just take a few hours of your day off, push play and just listen then I'm sure you will see what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Bottom Line: The Roots are worth every penny, please support them and buy your copy today.

0930289234|4.0|The best graphic novel that I have read to date. I will qualify that statement by stating that I used to read comic books as a child and teen (by no means was I ever an avid comic reader) and I have only read 3 graphic novels so far. As a genre, I do enjoy the artwork and the different mode of story-telling, but I do not find the experience as rich as reading traditional novels.<br /><br />On that note, I did truly enjoy most of what Watchmen had to offer. Alan Moore has created a rich history and a solid storyline that I found interesting and engaging. Some of the characters were a bit strange and/or annoying, but that is true of many fictional characters, so I would not consider that any fault of the genre.<br /><br />In this case, the artwork complimented the storyline well. In some examples of this medium that I've seen, the author relies too much on the artwork to tell the story. In Watchmen, the text and artwork compliment each other in such a way that both combine to tell the story.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed Watchmen and feel that it is a quality piece of literature. I do feel that it has been a bit over-hyped as far as it's overall literary merit, but that is a common occurrence when a \\"newer\\" medium is really taking a commanding foothold in it's particular field or genre.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The first time I heard about this book I thought \\"interesting.. not sure I am into the whole BSDM thing, but what the heck\\".  I am SO glad my subconscius, who yelled \\"oh come on, just give it a try\\" won the argument.  I LOVED the story.<br /><br />Anastasia Steel and Christian Grey as as different as two people can be, except for the fact that they are meant to be together.  She is innocent and has saved her herself for her true love; He is well-versed in carnal desires to the point that his life-style is one of dominant-submissive relarionships.  He has a kinly sex life and has no intention of changing...until he meets Anastasia.  The first book, and really all three, focus on the evolution of their relationship.  He is a difficult man to deal with, but deep inside he has reasons for being that way.  Anastasia has a good heart and sees through him as no one else can.  They argue, they make up (boy, do they!) and they show us that they are truly complimentary to one another.<br /><br />I love the sense of humor.  The plot kept me captivated.  I could NOT put the book down, especially on their more intimate moments!  Heck, made me want to get into a fight with my husband just so we could make up the way Christian and Anastasia do. :-)<br /><br />I highly recommend the book, and I also recommend you get the second and the third as you WILL want to know how this turns out.  I won't tell you, so find out for yourselfe.  You will be captivated!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would give it 6 stars if I could.<br /><br />You must read book 1 before you read this one.  The relationship started in book 1, book 2 is how they reconnect after something goes wrong.  Christian Grey has found someone with whom he is comfortable and who understands him.  Anastasia has found the love of her life.<br /><br />Love the sense of humor, the email exchanges are great.<br /><br />Get it, you won't be dissapointed!

B004EBUXSA|5.0|Excellent buy for $300. It is what it says it is. I have not tried to overclock it at all so I dont know how well it performs, but if your computer case doesnt have enough fans you will definitely want to get an aftermarket cooler for it. Watch the temperatures with core temp.
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is great at first I was disapionted but when I figured out to use it , it is amazing you get free music without wiring too
B005EGXNLS|4.0|I really love this series by Cornwell. I'm a big fan of historical fiction. Although this series may be a little more fiction than history. It gets the time period and major battles about the formation of England right. Uhtred, the protagonist, is my favorite character of all of cornwell's novels, he has a practical brutality that you can't help but admire. This particular book I'n the series has a little less action than some of the previous but is still a fantastic read.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I though this was a great app. I can now get my favorite songs for free. the only problem is. that it dosent download some songs
B005CM9DX6|2.0|Opeth has really lost it, or they're simply trying to appeal to a completely new audience while alienated all of their previous fans. This album has really lost the spirit of everything that made Opeth great in the past. Honestly, I will probably not purchase any future albums after this, at least not without listening to them first.
B0072X2O66|1.0|What a boring album... The song arrangements are terrible... The mix is terrible.... and the finally, the songs are just downright boring. It's a metal band trying to be metal, yet trying too hard to be metal... SNOOZE. Don't waste your money.

0385344228|5.0|By far the BEST book I have read in awhile.  It was exciting and the plot twist at the end was amazing that you didn't see  coming AT ALL.  Anyone who said they did read the last chapter first and then read the book.  Do not be swayed away from this book by the people that have given it 2 stars.  It was an amazing book and I can't wait to read the other two that he has written.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|It's one of the only hollywood films I've ever seen that genuinely has a positive message.<br />Sandra Bullock is great in it and the two love interests are really well done.<br />Uplifting, funny - without sticking it to you from the side. Everything hollywood mostly isn't.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B000K7UG34|5.0|I'm back with a movie review these reviews have to do with movies that were released in either 1992 or 2002. This is 2002 in film We Were Soldiers. This movie I saw around the same time as Black Hawk Down this mvoie has to do with a different conflict The Vietnam War. We Were Soldiers was directed by Randall Wallace he directed Man In The Iron Mask so I'd say that this is his best film. It stars Mel Gibson as Colonel Hal Moore, Sam Elliot as Major Basil Plumley, Barry Pepper as Joe Galloway, Chris Klein as 2nd Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan, Greg Kinnar as Major Bruce Crandall or Snake S  h  i  t as he is called. Mark McCracken as Captain Ed Freeman or \\"Too Tall\\". So the story is simple as this in 1954 The French Army gets owned by The North Vietnameese Army. They show no mercy & slaughter them. So then you go to 1965 where you have US Army Colonel Hal Moore & his family that are going to live on base cause you live on base where ever yu are stationed. Then you are introduced to Major Basil Plumley & he does bring a little comic relief to the movie. You have some of these troops playing base ball & you're introduced to Major Bruce Crandall & he is aruging with his buddy Captain Ed Freeman if he is out or he is safe. Colonel Moore is behind him & he tells him \\" I think you're out.\\" You go throught Colonel Moore trainning the troops & his stuff at home with his wife & kids there's a scene where his daughter asks what is a war. It is a good scene it is emotional where she asks will they take your life too. 1 of his men 2nd Lieutentant Geogheghan's wife had a baby & him & Colonel Moore become fast friends he talks to him about what it's like to a Soldier & Father. Mel Gibson does such a good job with the speech he gives to his men what's going on over here doesn't matter cause over there we are all American Soldiers. Then Moore finds out that The President isn't treating this like a real war. He is also in charge of The 7th Calvery the same unit that Genreal Custer was in charge of. He feels that not declaring a National Emergancy that he is being deprived of some of his best troops. So when you get to Nam Colonel Moore finds out that an American Base has been attacked & he is ordered to go into battle with 400 men into \\"The Valley Of Death\\" your get a really & I mean really bloody battle. Moore secures the weak areas before The NVA can. You go to the wives perspective where a lot of them start getting letters about their husband's death's. So Major Moore's wife becomes a bearer of bad news for a lot of them. You go to The NVA's perspective as well. At night Moore's forces catch enemy forces by suprise. The next day their still stuck at The LZ. Then you have a Journalist named Joe Galloway come into the picture during a lot of the brutality. Major Plumley hands him a rifle & tells him you ain't no journalist today. Moore & his troops are being overran by the enemy he tells his raidoman to call in a broken arrow meaning air reinforcements. The aircraft napalm the area a lot of NVA guys get BB Q'd but there attacking for every direction Moore's men get Nampalmed in a horrific scene. 1 soldier got burned really bad more than I can describe. I feel something for these guys cause I care about these characters. There's a part where base wants Moore to come back to Saigon for an evaluation Mel Gibson just sells it where he tells them no I will leave no man behind alive or dead they will all come home. You get to the final battle where it is all out & the troops are getting closer to the The NVA's underground tunnel. The NVA have strong set up & it feels like they are fighting for their lives the acting is that good. It looks like Moore is done for but then a helicopter comes in Major Crandall comes through & guns them a down helps them out. Colonel Moore stayed true to his speech that they will all come home. Despite what Mel Gibson has become lately he deserved some kind of award for this performance the scene where he is talking to Joe Galloway he has a breakdown alomost & says why didn't I die instead of my men. After almost a year Moore comes home to his wife & kids. LT Geoghengan's wife gets a letter by Moore's stating that her husband died in service. Then you have an older Hal Moore passing by The Wall as it's known & that's pretty much the movie. I'm sorry if I didn't explain the plot as good as I should've but war movies are harder for me to review. This is just an excellent movie Randall Wallace did a good job directing. Mel Gibson did a wonderful job. Sam Elliot was good, Chris Klein not the best actor he did a fine job in this flick. Barry Pepper did a really good job & Mark McCracken was ok. Everyone else did a very good job too. We Were Soldiers is defintly worth watching an extremly solid movie.
B001E95KVA|3.0|Paul Polak is an extraordinary man. A Czech Holocaust refugee as a child and a practicing psychiatrist throughout the 1960s and 70s, Dr. Polak turned his attention to the challenge of ending global poverty in 1981. In that year, he founded the International Development Enterprises (IDE), a Colorado-based nonprofit organization distinguished by its successful launch of the treadle pump that enables farmers to irrigate very small plots of land at minimal cost. IDE's mission more generally is to fashion and develop new tools to help poor farmers and other \\"dollar-a-day\\" families in developing countries work their way out of poverty. Now nearing 80, Dr. Polak has relentlessly pursued this mission for the past three decades.<br /><br />In Out of Poverty, Dr. Polak interweaves the IDE story and the principles that guide it with that of one Nepalese family who moved from poverty into the middle class. The fundamental precepts of Dr. Polak's work are clearly laid out in the introduction:<br /><br />\\"1. The biggest reason most poor people are poor is because they don't have enough money.<br /><br />\\"2. Most of the extremely poor people in the world earn their living now from one-acre farms.<br /><br />\\"3. They can earn much more money by finding ways to grow and sell high-value labor-intensive crops such as off-season fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />\\"4. To do that, they need access to very cheap small-farm irrigation, good seeds and fertilizer, and markets where they can sell their crops at a profit.\\"<br /><br />Much of Out of Poverty deals in detail with the challenges entailed in implementing these principles. Irrigation, including the story of the treadle pump, gets the most attention. Dr. Polak describes himself and the staff of IDE as what might be called catalysts rather than experts: from his perspective, the first step in any venture in rural development must be to talk to the people who will be affected by whatever is done -- and listen to them. The IDE approach is resolutely bottoms-up, because \\"To move out of poverty, poor people have to invest their own time and money. The path out of poverty lies in releasing the energy of Third World entrepreneurs.\\"<br /><br />IDE's work over the years has tightly focused on farmers. As he notes, \\"most of the poor people in the world live in remote rural areas that will likely continue to be bypassed by successive waves of urban-centered industrial growth.\\" However, in the concluding chapters of Out of Poverty, Dr. Polak also shares a number of ideas for helping slum-dwellers (\\"43 percent of the urban populatioin in developing regions\\") move out of poverty, too. The book is chock full of great ideas for small-scale entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Dr. Polak and IDE were pioneers in the bottoms-up development model that is fast emerging as the only approach likely to make a dent in the endemic poverty in so many poor countries.<br /><br />Regrettably, Out of Poverty is not well written. It is endlessly repetitive, with the same phrases and anecdotes appearing in chapters throughout the book, and it fails to deliver on its promise of sharing many examples of families that have moved into the middle class through IDE's work, since the only story told in any detail is that of one Nepalese farm family. That's a great pity, since this is a message that needs to be disseminated far more widely among policymakers around the world. A second edition, reorganized and with additional examples, would be a boon to the development community.<br /><br />([...])s resolutely bottoms-up, because \\"To move out of poverty, poor people have to invest their own time and money.

B000K7UG34|5.0|It's time for reviews dealing with movies that came out in either 2002 or 1992. This is 2002 in film We Were Soldiers. I saw this movie around the same time I saw Black Hawk Down. This movie deals with The Vietnam War. It was directed by Randall Wallace he directed Man In The Iron Mask so this is his best movie imo. It stars Mel Gibson as Colonel Hal Moore, Greg Kinnear as  Major Bruce  Crandall, Sam Elliott as Sergeant Major Basil  Plumley, Chris Klein  2nd Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan. Barry Pepper  Joe Galloway & Mark McCracken Captain  Ed  Freeman. Story is in 1954 French Soldiers  are massacred by North Vietnameese troops. In 1965 US involvement begain. Colonel Hal Moore & his family move to this base. Where he meets Sergeant Major Basil  Plumley & he provides a little bit of humor. Then he meets  Major Bruce Crandall & Captain Ed Freeman where they were playing baseball & Major Crandall & Captain Freeman were arguing if he was safe or out. Colonel Moore shows up & he says \\"I  think you're out.\\" Later on he meets  2nd Lieutenant Jack Geoghegan him & his wife are expecting a child. Geoghegan & Moore become fast friends. Colonel Moore gives a speech before they leave about it's not about our problems here over there we are all American Soldiers.Colonel Moore isn't happy that he is command of The  7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer as well The President didn't  declare  a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers. After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been attacked and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy  landing in The Valley of Death then battle breaks out  & it's a very violent battle that goes well into the night. Colonel Moore & his troops use the cover of darkness & use the enemies tactics against them. Back home Colonel Moore's wife has became the bearer of bad news when she has to tell the other women that there husbands have died in the war. You get the war from there prespective The NVA prespective & The US Soldiers prespective. A reporter Joe Galloway comes into the picture during the battle. Major Plumley hands him a rifle & tells him \\"You ain't no reporter today.\\" So The NVA have almost  completely overran by The US Soldiers position  and with no option left, Moore orders his radioman to call in Broken Arrow meaning air reinforcements.  Aircraft attack with bombs, napalm and machine guns The  NVA's and Viet Cong get BBQ'd  but an accident occurs dangerously close to Moore's men & there burned alive. It's bad to see these characters die cause I care about them. The Base in Saigon want Moore to com i for an evaluation. Mel Gibson just sells it he tells them I'm not leaving my men behind. In the speech before they left he said you will all come home alive or dead.  Moore surmises the enemy  is holed up in tunnels. At the same time The NVA commander plans a final assault. It leads to an all out battle which is very bloody & gorey. The US forces are getting closer to the tunnels. It looks like Colonel Moore is done for but Major Bruce Crandall and other helicopter gunships attack the enemy forces. The NVA commander orders everybody to leave.  True to his speech everyone alive hurt or dead come home before he steps on to a helicopter and leaves. Moore talks to Galloway where he breaks down & tells him why did my forces die instead of me.A year later Colonel Hal Moore comes home LT  Geoghegan's wife gets a letter telling her that her husband died in service then years later it shows an older Hal Moore going by The Wall. I'm sorry if I didn't explain the plot well enough but this was an amazing movie. Great job directing by Randall Wallace. Mel Gibson does a great job. Greg Kinnear was good. Sam Elliot was good. Chris Klien not the best actor but he did a fine job. Mark McCracken was ok.  Everybody was good. We Were Soldiers is a movie that I would recommend.ed in the war.

B005HP2J66|5.0|Werner Herzog's documentaries are beautifully made.<br />He is alone in bringing us information plus soul of the<br />places and people he interviews. I bought Encounters at the End of the World a few months ago, which touched me profoundly, as I have already being in the Antarctica Peninsula and share the feeling of seeing the pristine landscape and the god light at the horizon. Cave of Forgotten Dreams takes us to our unconscious, to the<br />first men and, for the first time, we are able to see artistic cro magnon buffalos, lions and strange animals that lived about 30.000/40.000 years ago. We have all to thank Herzog for all his films but, above all, for these two documentaries.

B00005KK9M|5.0|Reviews are subjective. I have always liked Kansas, and so I am happy to review their albums. People say Leftoverture and [[ASIN:B00005Y1M3 Point Of Know Return]] are the one-two punch from Kansas. I agree, and I learned it firsthand, without the hype. I bought the album when I was a kid, based on hearing a track during the \\"Deep of the Night\\" show on WIFC radio in Wausau, Wisconsin. It's still one of my favorites. I love organ-based prog rock, and it's even better if there's a violin involved. Later albums (after Point) seemed to get weaker and weaker. But you can't go wrong if you like Kansas and want to get started.<br /><br />If you enjoy decent prog rock, feel free to check out Steve Walsh's more recent (2000s) works like [[ASIN:B000TPXFTE Glossolalia]] and [[ASIN:B001FEO6SW Shadowman]], plus the two or three new MP3s he issued, like [[ASIN:B0010S4HSW Dark Day]] or [[ASIN:B004YX1WVA Faule Dr Roane]].<br /><br />And...the band Presto Ballet. What a wonderful band, trying hard to recreate the sound of the 70's -- Kansas, Yes, Styx -- crossed with Transatlantic ([[ASIN:B00004RDJ1 Stolt Morse Portnoy Trewavas]]), and succeeding. Best CD is [[ASIN:B001DGSGSI The Lost Art of Time Travel]].<br /><br />(Sorry for all the product links. I just had to try out the feature!)

B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books make up the best love story I have ever read. It puts you thru the wringer on emotions. I read thousands of ebooks or print books a year. Yes, this is true I do. I rarely buy print books because of space. If I do buy one it has to be a \\"keeper\\". These three qualify as a \\"keeper\\".<br /> The story keeps you so involved in it that you find yourself closing off the outside world so that you can emerse yourself in it.<br />Please don't let the BDSM elements keep you from reading it. It isn't one of the strong BDSM erotica books. This is a light version reading that touches upon it. It is necessary for the storyline. Don't get me wrong it is there but not in a heavy way like some I read. A vanilla person can read this and be very glad they did.<br /> My only problem with these three books is that there are only three. I wanted the story to continue on forever.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|This thoughtful and picturesque horror movie is the first vampire flick aimed specifically towards adults that I have seen in years. Honestly, if you sat through and really enjoyed the OTHER vamp movie/sears catalogue currently getting the rave reviews in theaters, then stop reading this and please castrate yourself. While that movie was based on a book written exclusively for overweight preteen emo girls, this movie was adapted from the screenwriter's own novel and openly alludes to themes of true loneliness and budding sexualities that will give you cause to think.<br /><br />If you feel that you have seen every conceivable vampire scenario to be told, then welcome to a remarkable picture.<br /><br />A Swedish film- the kind that sports subtitles- it tells the snowy tale of poor Oskar, prepubescent and friendless in a small town populated by impersonal personalities. Enter the beautiful and mysterious Eli, a girl with frightening secrets that compel both her and her father to live outside the norms of society. Humanity is given definition within the assorted innuendos and inflections of how they come to know and understand each other.<br /><br />Yes, the main characters are twelve year-olds, but this is by no means whatsoever a children's fare. The coldness of the personas is masterfully portrayed visually by the setting of the narrative itself, provoking the mindset of survival amongst base ugliness in contrast with gorgeously calm shots of drifting snowfalls and underscored themes of running water. There is a strong suggestion throughout of deep movement amidst the stillness of the landscape, like raw emotions waiting for their rightful chance to explode aloud. There is also a strong inspiration of Ingmar Bergman to the style of the camerawork as well.<br /><br />I promise you that you will not expect where this movie will take you as a viewer, which is lofty praise from a guy who is first to admit that nothing new has come from the horror genre in decades. I mean this.<br /><br />The violence portrayed is primal, and there are indeed murders throughout leading the townsfolk to prove their shortcomings like good citizenry.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is being described generally as a newer spin on the more traditional coming of age story, and there is a certain amount of truth to that, although it could also be noted that the very concept of age itself is given here a questioning of validity. The best macabre will always contain degrees of timelessness, just as youth lends itself freely to the precepts of immortality.<br /><br />This is a stunning bit of cinema. Only recently released in American theaters, having already garnering a growing acclaim internationally, this reviewer is keen to suggest you track down a showing, before said American audiences let it quietly fade away on to the cult sections of your local rental stores.an this.<br /><br />The violence portrayed is primal, and there are indeed murders throughout leading the townsfolk to prove their shortcomings like good citizenry.<br /><br />Let the Right One In is being described generally as a newer spin on the more traditional coming of age story, and there is a certain amount of truth to that, although it could also be noted that the very concept of age itself is given here a questioning of validity.

1587613379|5.0|Ethical Slut by Dossie Easton and Janet Hardy, review by Dan Nicholas, 1.3.13 edit<br /><br />The Slut word in the title scared me off for years.  But I got weary reading about this book and decided to get bold and buy it.  Good move.  Especial since one of the authors had come out, using her real name in the second edition.  But why me and this book?  For starters, as a retired priest I'm pretty much a traditionalist and yet probably at the same time in some denial about being an Eros positive male slut wannabe.  And, not unlike the 2% milk I drink, on a good day I'm only recently dabbling as a kinkster.  So, again, why am I reading this book; and a lot of people like me?<br /><br />Because--God forgive me if I'm wrong--I'm starting to think that the Divine is a bit slutty in a way.  The Divine into the slut thing? Really?  Well, think about it.  We all want more love and that's what we mean by slut--someone whose having more, getting more ecstatic connections than you, right?  We're just not sure what &#34;more&#34; means.<br /><br />Like a lot of folks who'd never be seen in an airport with this title in hand, I'm old fashioned.  I never wanted more than one woman I don't think.  But then reality kicks in.  I get honest and...well, a little more ethical.  I'm in my early 60s and on my third marriage.  Ouch.  So why did I pick up this book and, for heaven's sake?  And love it?  This is not what they taught me in seminary!  Maybe not.  But I'm starting to get honest and come out about being an ethical slut myself.<br /><br />For one thing I've come out this last decade with my eroticism in general, thanks to writers like Susie Bright.  To be honest, sexually speaking, I'm one of those &#34;pretty much you want to nail them all&#34; guys like Billy Crystal's character in When Harry Met Sally.  Yes, I want all the women.  Any guy who says different I say is most likely a liar.  And by Eastman and Hardy standards, not ethical.<br /><br />Yes, I was born with this curse that says I want love to go with; to go with all my man/woman connections.  And I even want to grow old with one woman, which makes me a 99% monogamy man.  Well, it's all madness, isn't it?  On this I'd toss my hat in with Rachel Resnick and her memoir, Love Junkie.  I am that love junkie man I guess.  So I'll always want to be having more sex than you are having.  Which makes me a slut.  And I want to be honest with myself in all things; ruthlessly so. Which makes me want to be honest sexually, too.  Now wasn't it Heraclitus in the 5th century BC who said that the senses are false witnesses to an impure soul?  Time for some soul honesty, seems to me.  I think all of us want to be ethical.  And we'd have to admit most of us like at least part of the joy of being a little more slutty.<br /><br />Again, the Divine is slutty sometimes, no?  This thought occurred to me the other day reading this book.  Especially if we think about opening up our sex life to God and to a beloved, a significant and intimate other.  Heck, to all the heavenly host, right?  Then are we not all then into a group sex thing in some fashion?  All love is group love maybe then?  At least a three way.  Especially if God/Goddess are invited to look.  And if our sex is ethical why wouldn't we want all the gods to look and to applaud?  Maybe even for all of us to open our eyes together?<br /><br />So I bought the book, knowing I had a few things to learn.  This title gave me practical tips on communicating what I need and want sexually and romantically.  It's all about being honest.  Good sex for me is always about how we can bring along the virtues as we get naked and honest, too.  That's what I got from this book, albeit in an odd way.<br /><br />Self honesty? I confessed recently to my wife being jealous of her cats; her chiropractor; her massage therapist; all those who get to touch her.  Sometimes even when I'm not invited so much to touch.  Hey, it happens.  I've a few things to learn then Iguess.  This book helped me admit I still am at time at least mildly jealous, which galls me.  I'm working on it.<br /><br />As to the craziness of slutty love--and this book does get a bit crazy--I have been reading this last decade many spiritual writers, Christian monastics and mystics and early century theologians who spoke oddly enough and openly about the wild madness of erotic love--Eros Maniakos--maniacal sold out give up everything, edgy to die for love for God.  Needless to say, a growing love for the poetry and prose of all risk taking with eroticism (Love Poems From God, Daniel Ladinsky) have kept me reading more.  From seventh century forward, St. Maximus the Confessor of Constantinople (Turkey, Istanbul); to Elder Porphyrios of modern times in (Athens, Greece), or St. Symeon the New Theologian in the 10th century and his Divine Eros.<br /><br />Holy men and women of God speak of edgy eros, of all out desire for the Divine.  Philip Sherrard seems to in his Christianity and Eros (1976).  So I guess that makes all these writers slutty, too.  They want to have more than you're having.<br /><br />I'm thinking now of Bernini's statue of St. Teresa of Avila in the West (loved her Interior Castle).  The image of that sculpture in Rome is etched in my mind here.  There she is fainting in orgasmic bliss, in 3D, in church no less.  In the throes of erotic release.  In church.  Her heart is being pierced by the arrow of God and it is a sex thing.  Unless you are a dull person you can't see this and take it in.  (Does the Pope know about this?  Is he still permitting this sort of sex in church?  My, my.)<br /><br />Professor Kyriacos Markides of Maine speaks often of Eros Maniakos in his Mountain of Silence (2002) and also in his other works: Gifts of the Desert and Inner River.  Any love story, it seems to me, is a story of love madness.  So this was my pull to actually read about all out ethical eroticism detailed here by these two mad for love poly authors.  Who proudly call themselves both slutty, severely erotic, and ethical.  OK, why not.  I'm a philosopher and a theologian.  We talk about ethics a lot.  We best get honest about the eros part, too.<br /><br />As to the confluence of spirituality and love and sexuality, Easton and Hardy take a serious look at this with their other work, Radical Ecstasy (2004) which is all about bliss, the divine, Tantra, falling, and the losing control thing.  Breath, chakras, surrender.  So much for the charge that these authors are only and always about some slutty sex equals pleasure only doctrine.  God gets in there with them.  Also, I see these days more writing about BDSM and &#34;leather spirituality&#34; and the transcendence of dark eros.  Again: my, my.<br /><br />I'm not the only one in recently decades to grown weary with the dishonesty of the traditional church--Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox--around sexuality.  When single and divorced ten years back I asked an Orthodox monk and speaker at a Greek Orthodox two day workshop on Sex, Love and Marriage what leaders in the church had in as advice for the 45 million mid-life folk in this country who are now dating online.  To this day I love his crisp reply to me and the 100+ Sex, Love and Marriage workshop inquirers in attendance.  Said the then monk now church hierarch: &#34;Advice from the church? To be honest, we don't have a clue.&#34;<br /><br />So, I got over the title of this book, over my false purity about the slut word.  I read it.  So I could get a clue.  I spent dozens of hours thinking about the stuff Easton and Hardy brought up here.  They became during my reading here my priest/priestess love coaches.<br /><br />I had to get ethically honest and I invite you to as well. If I as Mr. Church guy am so into the romantic love/marriage/family monogamy path, why am I on my third marriage?  If I'm so one-man-for-one-woman forever...why am I still attracted to other women?  Why was the divorce so costly and painful?  Worthit but costly?  Twice.  And remarried at age 58, why do I get jealous of my wife's cats and friends sometimes.  Each who also want to love her?  And why does Dark Eros (Thomas Moore, 1998) and even some of BDSM even still fascinate me?  And why have I read dozens of books on Eros Maniakos and the mystics and monks and nuns who have retained their commitment to mad, go for broke love for God?  Guess it all makes me rather down in the trenches slutty some.  I'm getting to like the term, actually.<br /><br />Again, I picked up this Easton-Hardy title for the same reason I picked up Tristan Taormino 's Opening Up (BTW, of my 170 Amazon reviews, it and this one are the most popular to date) because two couple friends of mine and one single friend are in one of those &#34;complicated&#34; (Baldwin's character to Streep's character: &#34;It's complicated!&#34;) relationships that are poly type.  Poly.  Even the word intrigues and confounds.  My partner and I have spent hours discussing these creative relationships our friends have.  Why parts of what they have seem to work? And why do some Poly Type relationships seem so alive while some old school type Married Folk relationships seem to endure only in their deadness?<br /><br />I recently read and loved Sex At Dawn by Christopher Ryan, made me rethink monogamy.  Like Ethical Slut, Sex At Dawn makes me rethink how church people preach monogamy for life but aren't much better at it statistically than the unchurched.  And, besides, when I set out a decade back on my own path dating in midlife, trying to be honest, I knew I'd likely be &#34;kissing a few frogs&#34; mixing it up naked with a few ladies on my self discovery path.  I wanted to be ethical.<br /><br />So, in an odd way, dating is always going to be a serial monogamy/poly/ethical homework assignment.  Especially if you invite God in, seems to me.  Especially if you are trying to be honest and perhaps date several women at a time; which I was only able to do for three months.  Which makes me not good poly material I guess.<br /><br />My biggest take away from the book?  Solid tips on jealousy, honesty, agreements, communication, saying what you want.  Meaning what you say.  How to fight fair.  Flirting honestly with other women while in a committed relationship.  Flirting, yes.  Something I've always done and don't intend to stop is flirting with the Safeway cashier.  Thanks to the call if this book I'm increasingly OK with that.<br /><br />A confession here.  After reading this book I'm still pretty much with author Chloe Caldwell.  (See her article: Legs Get Led Astray, 2012) As she said, it takes special, almost otherworldly people to do the poly thing.  Caldwell shows herself in her essay on Why I Am No Longer An Ethical Slut found at the Faster Times zine.  &#34;As much as I love the idea, as much as I think it is a wonderful book, I don't think being an Ethical Slut is possible. At least not for him. At least not for me.&#34;<br /><br />One of her friends commented on Caldwell's mad love relationship: &#34;Chloe, you guys spent three years being shady for dopamine.&#34;  Caldwell agreed.  Yes, being shady is not being ethical.<br /><br />&#34;It's never been better said. We were cheaters, liars; we were addicted to a feeling we'd created. There was not one ethical thing about it.&#34;<br /><br />So, to wrap up this tome of a review, even though I was a 98% voyeur type while reading all this about sluthood from Easton and Hardy, I learned a lot.  I learned even more than simply tolerance for these poly writers.  I learned some key relationship let's-talk-about-it-in-the-daylight skills.  Actually, I liked the Eastman/Hardy smaller title When Someone You Love Is Kinky (2000).  Ethical Slut is a far more exhaustive work.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for died in the wool traditionalists like the unbrave one star reviewer here at Amazon who threw the book away half read.  Monogamy folk and poly timers alike could up their communication skills on jealousy and fighting fair paying attention to what's contained here.  And and get something in just contemplating the whole business of what it means to want more. A thoughtful book.Dark Eros (Thomas Moore, 1998) and even some of BDSM even still fascinate me?

B004TI5N38|4.0|Puller is NOT a knockoff of Reacher.  I read the reviews before ordering the book and at no time while I was reading Zero Day did I feel a conflict of characters. I suppose you can twist nearly any book into a knockoff of another if you're so inclined.<br /><br />I do prefer the Reacher series, it pulls you along at a faster more engaging clip, but Zero Day was a good read on it's own.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I take reading in spurts.  Not since the Twilight Series have I enjoyed a book so much that I could not put it down.  It starts slow, but oh my after the first 2 pages, I was hooked.  It is well written does not go into endless pages of detail.  It gets right to the point.  I liked it so well, I am now reading the second in the series and have bought the last one.  It is well worth reading.  And I love reading it from my Kindle.  It goes right back to where I left off.  No crimping of pages or bookmarks.

B005QF0GIK|1.0|I'm being somewhat sarcastic, but when listening to this offering I kept thinking, wow, this would be a great soundtrack for the Twilight Movies. Depressing, devoid of musical interest (with almost no exception), monotone. I kept waiting to get the \\"point\\" of the project, but by song #9 I was ready to run the bathwater and look for a straight razor to slit my wrists! I am a big fan of Meshell and am ready to take many musical leaps and twists with her as she grows as a musician/artist/woman/human, but this one left me cold. Song #10 was passable, #12 had some interesting musicality, and finally #13 was something I could finally say, OK I like it...Not sure if I can suffer through another listening session to see if I missed something, or maybe I'll just give it to my Pop music driven daughter? I was so excited when it came in the mail too, DAMN!

0393338827|5.0|The Great Recession is not fondly remembered by most people, but Michael Lewis found a few who enjoyed the crash because they had bet big money on it. The stories of those smart, courageous outsiders are engaging and amusing in Lewis's telling. And the tales have plenty of flesh on them, because winners are more willing than losers to talk about their financial history.<br /><br />Lewis is a reliable \\"jungle guide\\" through the world of CDOs and CDSes, so I got the education I wanted from the book. I was also very entertained.<br /><br />Before reading The Big Short, I read Lewis's first book, Liar's Poker, which is a classic that I'd never gotten to. Liar's Poker is not a prerequisite to The Big Short, but it's an interesting prequel and it's well worth the read in its own right.

0307593312|4.0|Read this on the kindle and enjoyed it. The first half of the book moved too slowly for my taste and would have benefitted with some compression, but on the other hand some of the themes are never explicitly explained and therefore are only revealed through repetition. There is a philosophical (sort of an existentialism in the age of string theory) angle, there is a sci-fi action angle and there is an ordinary, though melancholy, love story underneath it all.

0143119680|4.0|When I first started reading A Discovery of Witches I must admit I was skeptical. I've read too many bad supernatural romances in the past few years to go into a vampire book with open-minded optimism. However, this book by Deborah Harkness took me pleasantly by surprise and kept me eagerly reading to the very last page.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is the story of Diana Bishop, a scholar and a professor who also happens to be descended from a long line of witches. Diana has turned her back on magic (well, mostly) and devoted herself to scholarship instead. The story begins when Diana is exposed to some unexpected spellcraft while looking through a rare manuscript in Oxford's Bodleian Library, and she is forced to slowly make her way back into the world of the supernatural.<br /><br />With all the vampire/werewolf/witch fiction that's come out lately this may sound like just more of the same, but I promise you it's not. Deborah Harkness is a professor and a scholar, and it shows in her writing and in the world she creates. No adolescent angst here; her leading woman and man are strong, intelligent and educated characters. The supernatural world she imagines for the reader is a deep, intricate, and engrossing one; one that is supported by a surprising amount of science and scholarship. As a scholar myself I was thrilled to find a kindred spirit in the serious and studious Diana Bishop, who is passionate in a way that only seekers of knowledge can be. I was pleased and invigorated by the discussions of genetics and evolution which pepper the story (although there were one or two times when even my generous willingness to suspend disbelief was challenged.)<br /><br />In summary, A Discovery of Witches is what I would call (with tongue in cheek) a \\"gateway book;\\" bridging the gap between the popular but pandering vampire pulp and the more challenging but rewarding academic fiction. A Discovery of Witches may not be quite up to par with the beauty and brilliance of A.S. Byatt's Possession, but it's definitely a good stepping stone for a ravenous reader who is ready for something more than what the \\"supernatural teen\\" section currently has to offer.A.S.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book - it was not what I thought it would be like. Initially I wasn't too excited to read it but figured it must be good after seei all the rave reviews. So I figured I'd give it a try and loved it! A little bit of suspense with a love story are perfect for me. I highly recommend it! Just startig the second book - yeah!
0880795433|5.0|The book and cards can be bought separately or as a set. The Creative Whack Pack is one of my favourite training resources. It is a set of cards each having an idea to stimulate creativity in some way. I've often used these to `unstick' thinking when working with a group. It is worth keeping a pack in your Trainer's Box. It is now available as an iPhone and iPad app too!<br /><br />The book, A Whack on the Side of the Head, has exercises, questions and stories to provoke creative thinking. Several of these can be used in workshops.
0553381695|4.0|Going straight from the crescendo and finale of Game of Thrones to the beginning of Clash of Kings, I was a little disappointed.  I understand that other POV characters are necessary to see what is happening elsewhere in Westeros (Davos/Theon) but a whole new entrance of characters caused an almost disinterest in what is happening.  But, that feeling only last for the first 200 pages or so, then Martin once again delivers with a masterpiece.  The characters become more real, the world they live in is more real and the political chaos on Westeros is better than ever.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read the first book after seeing it being talked about on the Today show.  I couldn't put it down.  I can't say if it was because it was written really well or if it's the fact that I once lived in a Dom/sub relationship and wanted to get lost in that lifestyle again.  Ana truely wasn't suitable for Christian's world and Christian was far from being vanilla in Ana's world.  Keeping in mind that this was a fiction book, the author captured a Dom's lifestyle nicely in parts of the book.  I loved the fact that there was a list of soft/hard limits, dos/don'ts...etc that Christian gave to Ana up front.  I would have liked to seen Christian push Ana on some of her hard limits... BUT that isn't what the story was about.  I have read all three books and yes in the beginning I thought it was going to be pretty much an all smut (from what the Today show was saying) book but then the second book started to change and then the third book was great.  Although... if I were Ana, I would be afraid every day of my life of Christian.  He could snap at any given second and beat the crap out of her... he truely was a Sadomasochist, not a Master or a Dom.  He took it to the extreme, he wanted to beat the crap out of people just to make himself feel better.  A true Dom/Master would never do that to His submissive... a slave on the other hand, that's a different story.

B00792EGES|5.0|I am a live music junkie. I usually forego the DVD experience in exchange for the live one. For any concert goer, the anticipation builds as the crowd gets larger. You spend 30 minutes getting to know your fellow junkie next to you as you both agree to ride the rail for the entire show. Suddenly, the lights go out and the crowd roars. A strum of a guitar or a beat from the drum signals that the show is about to start. Then your band takes the stage! As the band pounds out the crowd favorite songs, you wait for that moment that makes your experience so personal.<br /><br />I got the opportunity to attend a private screening of this DVD 2 days ago. The producers of THIS DVD have done an outstanding job at capturing these moments. It's not just watching the band play onstage. You get this experience as if you are right there in all the action. They captured those moments that make your concert experience REAL. Watching the band interact with each other, from smiles to nods, to seeing them interacting with the audience. Even better, the producers were even able to capture fans interacting with each other. The amount of energy given on this DVD will blow you away! It is a definate treat to any Alter Bridge fan and will enhance their collection....but I also recommend this DVD to any live music fan and experience this. I personally cannot wait for the 3D movie showing this summer!

I can't express how much happier I have been since giving up wheat -- and it's only been one week!<br />I am a young female, 129 lbs, and pretty slender, so I didn't pick this book up to lose weight (although I wouldn't mind that).<br />I have had terrible allergies my entire life (hayfever, dust, pets) and recently they have gone out of control.  I thought it might be diet related so I decided to give this a try.<br /><br />Here's what I've noticed so far: While my allergies have remained *sigh* I have SIGNIFICANTLY more energy. I have always been pretty lazy, not going to lie, and now I feel like I actually want to get up and do things! I had no idea wheat was killing my energy level.  Also, my mind is much clearer. I notice things that I didn't notice before (e.g., I never realized how much of a slob I really was).  Now I keep things clean and don't just let the house get filthy.<br />I've lost 1.6 lbs this week alone.  I have now, out of nowhere, taken an interest in cooking and making creative meals like caprese salad, Parmesan chicken, and wheat free muffins. I now avoid the big chain food store and stay local as much as possible.  My depression and anxiety symptoms have almost completely lifted.  I walk more, rather than drive. I am more \\"regular,\\" but I also attribute that to adding coconut milk to my diet which is a diuretic. It tastes great in coffee!<br /><br />The only thing that I don't like about this diet is that it's a little expensive to follow initially. There is a definite startup $$$ needed to begin and all your old wheat products are now of no use.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend reading this, or simply just going wheat-free.<br /><br />If you're at all interested in following my journey, you can check out my new blog which I'm using to document my progress (and post yummy wheat-free recipes) at wheatbeater(dot)wordpress(dot)com.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After seeing this book discussed on yesterday morning's Good Morning America with so much enthusiasm, I downloaded it onto my Kindle immediately. I do like novels and romances but stay with the mild and mainstream. After staying up all night to finish it, I think this book has changed my life! I absolutely loved it and cannot wait to continue on with the rest of the trilogy.The author knows how to make her characters and their dialog move the reader and push all the right buttons. I loved this so much and will add to my keeper shelf so I can reread it often. I now feel there is something very appealing about the idea of giving control over to someone and complete surrender. I read books for entertainment and a bit of escapism every now and then, and this book really did it for me. It is easy to see why the entire panel of the morning show were almost giddy talking about this. I can also understand why bookstores are having a hard time keeping it stocked. Another reason why I am so in love with my Kindle! This is an exciting read that I promise you will love!
0061726834|5.0|Read all my reviews at[...]<br />I actually read Delirium last September, before I began my blog, but have not posted a review. Since I just finished the sequel, Pandemonium, I thought I'd go ahead and get Delirium posted first. My review for Pandemonium will be up soon so be sure to check back:)<br /><br />I remember reading the synopsis of Delirium last year while browsing titles at Paperback Swap, and not being so blown away. Like many others, I thought that a dystopic about a world where love is evil and and all people over eighteen are \\"cured\\" of it, sounded not only far fetched, but kind of lightweight. Then, I ran across Delirium at my local library a few months later, and decided to give it a try. Within the first few pages of reading, I knew that I had made an egregious error in judgement. Did I say that Delirium's subject matter was lightweight? I am here to tell you that it's most certainly not. A world devoid of love is a dark place, people, dark and scary.<br /><br />'One of the downsides of the procedure, in the absence of deliria nervosa, is some people find parenting distasteful--cases of full blown detachment-- when a parent is unable to bond normally, dutifully, and responsibly, to a child, and winds up drowning them or sitting on their windpipes or beating them to death, when they cry-- are few...'<br /><br />After reading that it hit me, the full implications of not being physically capable of love. Not just romantic love, but any kind of love. The love a mother or father feels for their own child. The love that friends feel towards each other. All of that is gone when you are surgically altered at the age of eighteen. Why would a society choose to mandate such a thing? Because love is a powerful emotion. How does the saying go? There is thin line between love and hate. Basically the government or \\"Consortium\\" can control the population more completely when it removes strong emotions from the people. That, friends, is a truly frightening thing.<br /><br />This is the world that Lena Holoway lives in. At the book's start, Lena is the staunchest supporter of the Cure, and with good reason. Her mother committed suicide after three failed attempts at receiving the Cure, and Lena has dealt with the stigma of this her entire life. Not only that, she is beyond frightened at the possibility of contracting delirium nervosa, feeling she may be genetically predisposed to it. Lena lives with her Cured aunt Carol, who is about as warm as a dead fish, and cousins, and has very little contact with her recently Cured sister. Other than her best friend Hana, Lena is completely alone and isolated, counting down the days until her own procedure. The beginning of the book introduces us to this new world through Lena's eyes, and early on I kept thinking to myself that I couldn't wait for her to just wake up. I couldn't wait for her to discover the truth, and I couldn't wait to witness the changes to her character when she did. I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Enter Alex, who shatters all Lena's illusions about the world she lives in. I love Alex. I love that he is so patient with Lena, and never gives up on her as she slowly wakes up to what is going on around her. And I love how Lena, even when all he beliefs are disproved one after another, never gives up. And I cheered that when real love presented itself to her, she went for it, even when she believed it was going to kill her in the end.<br /><br />There are many other awesome characters in Delirium. Hana, Lena's best friend, is wonderfully written. And little Grace's role in the book absolutely tore right through me. I sincerely hope we see more of them in future books because I'm not ready to let them go just yet.<br /><br />Now I haven't yet mentioned the writing in this book. Oh, the writing in this! Let's do that now, here, a passage about Lena and Alex:<br /><br />'And in-between, snapshot, moments, mere seconds, Alex smearing chocolate ice cream on my nose after I've complained I'm too hot; the heavy drone of bees circling above us in the garden, a neat line of ants marching quietly over the remains of our picnic; Alex's fingers in my hair; the curve of his elbow under my head; Alex whispering, \\"I wish you could stay with me,\\" while another day bleeds out on the horizon, red and pink and gold...'<br /><br />Lauren Oliver is a poet. Her words aren't just words. They are lines of poetry painting pictures, heart breaking pictures.<br /><br />'I'll tell you another secret, this one for your own good. You may think the past has something to tell you. You may think that you should listen, should strain to make out it's whispers, should bend over backward, stoop down low to hear its voice breathed up from the ground, from the dead places. You may think there's something in it for you, something to understand or make sense of.<br />But I know the truth. I know from the nights of coldness. I know the past will drive you backward and down, have you snatching at whispers of wind and the gibberish of trees rubbing together, trying to decipher some code, trying to piece together what was broken. It's hopeless. The past is nothing but weight. It will build inside of you like a stone.<br />Take it from me: If you hear the past speaking to you, feel it tugging at your back and running it's fingers up your spine, the best thing to do-- the only thing--is run.'<br /><br />And beautiful pictures.<br /><br />'That's when it happens. Standing there in-between two disgusting dumpsters in some crappy alley with the whole world crumbling down around me, and hearing Alex say those words, all the fear I have carried with me since I learned to sit, stand, breathe-- since I was told that at the very heart of me was something wrong, something rotten and diseased, something to be suppressed-- since I was told that I was always just a heartbeat away from being damaged-- all of it vanishes at once, That thing--the heart of hearts of me, the core of my core--stretches and unfurls even further, soaring like a flag: making me feel stronger than I ever have before. I open my mouth and say, \\"I love you too.\\"'<br /><br />Hopeful pictures.<br /><br />'For the first time in my life I actually feel sorry for Carol. I'm only seventeen years old, and I already know something she doesn't know: I know that life isn't life if you just float through it. I know the whole point--the only point-- is to find the things that matter, and hold onto them, and fight for them, and refuse to let them go'.<br /><br />And powerful pictures. Here, the last lines of the book:<br /><br />'You have to understand. I am no one special. I am just a single girl. I am five feet two inches tall and I am in-between in every way.<br /><br />But I have a secret. You can build walls all the way to the sky and I will find a way to fly above them. You can try to pin me down with a hundred thousand arms, but I will find a way to resist. And there are many of us out there, more than you think. people who love in a world without walls, people who love into hate, into refusal, against hope, and without fear.<br /><br />I love you.

0385342063|5.0|I love this genre of writing. All kinds of screwball antics and comedic situations plus a developing romance that feels deep and real. Like all Kinsella books, the heroine misinterprets everything and behaves like an idiot, but out of good motives. The hero is justifiably angry and then realizes there are benefits to her approach to life. She saves the day somehow; he realizes his life is so much more meaningful with her around. Yes, it's the same plot, but the details in this version are really hilarious. Using text messages to build the relationship is truly brilliant - we see the depth of their relationship unfold slowly in small increments. It's delicious and moving.
B00006RJSG|4.0|i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because my box came with a big slash on the side of it, a pen knife slash. cut through the plastic and the paper insert. but dvd works fine
B00147MZW4|3.0|Book arrived before quoted time.  The book is the same as \\"Confession of a Shopaholic\\"!  Wished I would have known that and I wouldn't have two of the same book but with different title. After a while, it gets frustrating to know this person is real!  There are many women out there like this!  Started reading the series but after the second book ~ I don't want to know Becky anymore ~ she needs help, grow up and become a responsible human being!
0800141849|5.0|To be honest, I've never seen this movie. I had gotten this as a birthday gift for my mom since she saw it on New Year's Day and absolutely loved it. Since I bought it, my mom loves the movie a lot. It gave her a good laugh!
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|Field of Dreams was an awesome film. I had to watch this movie for a class, so I had my doubts about it. However, it was much better than I had expected. Kevin Costner & James Earl Jones played their roles exceptionally well!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|AI is solid, plays well. Would be better if it showed list of moves and removed pieces, but overall great game.
B0058VW36U|4.0|got to get game better than gameloft games and that's pretty good if you don't like it then you got problems
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very well designed app. I really like all of the different variations offered. The only frustration is that I can't beat it more often!

B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love this item. Fits my kindle perfect and I like the color. I like the light weight feel to it.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This is the best headphone amp to use for travel...You can charge it at the same time you're using it, although I get a slight bit of hiss and feedback. Not an issue when you've charged it prior. I like to bring my laptop with me to work for audio editing purposes and I've had problems being able to listen at louder volumes. But now that I got this nifty little thing, the volume boost that I got is more than what I need, which is great. It's also small enough that it doesn't take up a lot of space in my bag. It's also convenient that I can charge it using the USB cord that it comes with. I was going to buy the E7 initially, but this is enough and saved me half the money I would've spent on the E7 alone.
B0034G4OXQ|3.0|Despite a great cast, intelligent script and interesting concept.<br />Despite a master of concision at the helm (after seeing this and J. Edgar, perhaps former master).<br />Despite a subject I'm fascinated with.<br />Despite these and many other potential positives, Hereafter is just toooooo daaaarrrnnnn sloooooww[...] I could barely stay awake, and it was the afternoon.<br />Thought it was my fault. Rented it months later. Identical response.<br />Looks good, feels pretty real, everybody clearly put their heart into it, but it just didn't click for me.<br />More than once I wondered if this is what limbo feels like.<br />Perhaps that's the point. But that's not a feeling I usually seek when watching movies, and when it is Ingmar awaits.<br />If you love Clint and Matt and the subject, this might do it for you.<br />But I love all three, and no go.<br />Well made nonetheless, perhaps Hereafter was just made for a different mind than mine.
0312370849|5.0|For me, this was one of those books I didn't want to put down.  I cared about the characters and the story was very interesting.  One of the problems with a book I don't want to put down is that it ends much too quickly and then I must attempt to find another one I like as much!  I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is actually a really good game.  it has games for everyone. everyone should download and play.  very addictive. and its free.

1439152799|5.0|This book weaves the story of several lives and I felt as if I personally knew each one. I'm not a super fast reader so this book took me a while, but I found myself grabbing it whenever I had a moment or two to spare and then stayed up way to late many nights to read it. I absolutely loved it!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been playing for years but this is my favorite version of spider. I download it to all my devices.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I do not recommend this kids animated film to anybody. There are some cute movies out there better than this one. This one is just atrocious! The first one had decent graphics and kind of cool concept. Happy Feet Two is absolutely the same, but actually worse. The songs they picked are horrible. CGI is worse. Worst of all they continue with the racist depictions of the penguins! They have these smaller sized penguins who speak with Hispanic/Mexican accents, and, SURPRISE, all they care about is females. How much more racist can this get!?<br /><br />Avoid at all cost, don't waste your money.
B0054W4JQK|3.0|This book took me a while to \\"get into\\" but once there I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to read in one sitting.
0345522478|3.0|I read Book 1 of the Iron Druid Chronicles a few weeks ago and am struggling to recall enough details of the plot to write even a brief recap. And perhaps that is all the recap you really need.<br /><br />Atticus is a super hot druid (see cover) which is impressive as he is actually thousands of years old. He lives in Arizona selling tea and tarrow cards to old people and college students (respectively) while romping about the desert with his talking dog/banter buddy Oberon. Ages ago he managed to get his hands on the legendary sword Fragarach and now Aenghus Og, the powerful Celtic God and original owner, has decided he wants it back.<br /><br />Atticus is the James Bond of Druids. He's powerful, routinely underestimated, has lots of nifty cool gadgets, and women frequently drop their panties for him. Although Atticus doesn't have much time for lady-fun because has his hands full battling the minions of Aenghus Og. Luckily for Atticus he is near-immortal due to an arrangement he made long ago with Morrigan, Celtic Chooser of the Slain, who has agreed to not come for him. So that's handy.<br /><br />Seems like a decent setup for a fun romp. But too many things bothered me about Hounded:<br /><br />  1. It reads like watching a video game. Atticus battles increasingly challenging minions until finally facing the big bad. Also, like video games, Atticus regenerates life points quickly by sleeping next to mother earth.<br />  2. The ability to regenerate quickly and being near-immortal frankly removes a lot of the tension from the battle sequences.<br />  3. There are never any consequences to things Atticus does. The most obvious example was when Atticus beheads a baddie in full view of a mortal neighbor who basically shrugs it off because Atticus is a good guy and wouldn't have done so without a good reason.<br />  4. Atticus has no personal or emotional journey. In fact he doesn't really seem to want for anything beyond being left alone to play with his dog and hang out in his shop. He's simply reacting to the stream of baddies that show up on his front door.<br />  5. Is there such a thing as too much action? There is so much action going on that I started skimming. It wasn't like I was worried about how it was going to turn out (see point #1 & #2).<br />  6. I think the dog (Oberon) is supposed to be funnier than he is. Yeah Oberon is continually asking for a harem of french poodles to frolic with. Eh...OK.<br /><br />This is a hugely popular series that gets rave reviews on Amazon. It is definitely better than your average Urban Fantasy, filled with lots of action, a large cast of immortal characters, and snappy banter. If you're looking for fun, light, accessible fantasy, this definitely fits the bill. But it's also sort of forgettable. I considered buying the second book in the series but I suspect it's probably a lot like the first (if I'm missing out on greatness, please let me know). I figure I could save $8 by just putting this on the shelf and re-reading it in a year or so.<br /><br />Urban fantasy isn't my thing. I love the Kate Daniels/Magic Bites series. But generally most of what I've read (Patricia Briggs, Jeaniene FrostKaren, Marie Moning) has left me cold.

B000000ZKD|3.0|As a hard-core Beatle freak I'll try anything once, especially when done by B T & t MGs. Hey, I'm a sucker for Green Onions.<br />  Mclemore Ave. is a selection of Abbey Road songs, out of order from The Beatles' crack at it, and much closer to muzak. On my first trip through it I was at least amused at the liberties taken on a given theme while occasionally getting momentarily lost. On this list of such singable songs I missed the singin'! But a replay or three later I wondered why I'd not expected exactly what I'd heard the first time. It's interesting to a pop/rock fan, at least this one, and perhaps just the ticket for Mr. Guder as he talks business while sitting in traffic in his Beemer. It's jaaazzzz.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend who had heard about it on the local radio station and asked me if I heard of it.  I hadn't, and I had just finished my last read so I looked it up saw it was in my price range and took a chance.  I am so glad that I did.  As I said, I knew nothing about the story or the hype or the negative reviews here on Amazon.  It truly is the best way to read.  I was pleasantly surprised by the emotions that were prevalent in the story and how the actual story made me feel.  Any time an author and a story can elicit any kind of emotional reaction from me, I know that I am in for a good read and that is exactly what I got.  So if you are like me and willing to take a chance give FIFTY SHADES OF GRAY a shot.  I had to immediately by the next in the trilogy and start reading it right away.

B000ZMVAXO|5.0|This little thing is amazing. Speaking of little, it was actually a bit bigger than I thought it would be judging by the picture, however it fits perfectly into the jack of my strat copy. The distortion sound this thing achieves is killer - especially impressive due to its price. I have been plugging it into my computer speakers and it sounds great. I tried it out with some ipod earbud headphones and the sound was decent, but I think to get the most out of the vox to headphone experience you may need some better quality ones. I am completely satisfied with the sound out of my computer speakers (they are old, cheap ones too). I would highly recommend this to anyone starting out playing the electric guitar. It is great for practice and if you have speakers lying around, it would be a very economical substitute for a small amp.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|This was a book that was recommended to me by a friend.  It was interesting right away, but I couldn't believe the stories would be so heart warming to hear from the individuals that lived on the Island.  There were mysteries and surprises that kept me entertained.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a good app. It has different daily reading plans. It comes in various versions.  You should try it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the Bible YouVersion is the best. It is so easy to get up every morning and read my Bible study. Than housing much.
B004P73YLQ|5.0|I do understand the Alan Douglas reference and some of that was in poor taste as to how it was accomplished. How someone can lump that into what Janie is doing is beyond me. I personally am thoroughly enjoying everything to date including this release. Those who do not well that's too bad but I wanted to comment so as not to let others comments dissuade people from enjoying this release. There are many exceptional moments on this and is worth every penny.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|I bought a 3D TV and 3D blue ray player with surround sound to watch movies like this!  Sure, the plot isn't sophisticated and didn't win any Oscars (that I know of), but is this movie fun and entertaining with great 3D effects?  ABSO-FREAKIN' LUTELY!  I currently own maybe 20 3D blue rays, and this is one that my family and I enjoy the most.  Some titles are geared more for little kids, and some are more for adults. This is 3D fun for all ages. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is awesome, the sound complaint has been fixed, and i luv how it gives u goals to work at!!! Ps i just bought the prettiest dress ever from Kohl's and it is rockin'!!!!!?
B0028AQLYE|1.0|When I first opened the box I looked and thought it odd that something that is supposed to form a watertight seal had no gasket or O ring on it at all. I initially thought there was no way this would work and be water tight once installed.<br /><br />I was right, it isn't watertight, it leaks.<br /><br />Also the resistance to breathing is quite high.<br /><br />I'd give it a zero if I could.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Ok... I'll admit it. I am a stubborn, stubborn human being. I heard the hoopla surrounding this book. I came to the page determined to download it THREE separate times. And EACH time I read the description and thought \\"yeah this is NOT the book for me\\". I'm not into futuristic \\"sci-fi-ish\\" books. I \\"don't do\\" post apocalyptic fiction. FINALLY after MUCH prodding from multiple friends that told me they never read that kind of stuff either... and they loved it. So I finally gave in and downloaded the book. Well as the title for my review says, all I can say is WOW.<br /><br />I admit it, I hate when I come on here to read reviews and it seems like every single one says either \\"It was a page turner!\\" or \\"I couldn't put it down!\\" Well... this book WAS a page turner, and I COULDN'T put it down. I started reading this book right when I went to bed (mistake). I quite literally stayed up all night long and read. I HAD to finish this book. It was SO well written with SUCH vibrant characters, it was truly one of the best books that I have ever read. The story was fast paced, but not rushed. The story was complete as a stand alone, but left me very anxious for the next chapter. Every aspect, every facet of this book was an overwhelming success.<br /><br />So if you're like me, and have been weary to get this book because \\"it's not the kind of things I usually read\\". PLEASE, learn from my mistake and click the \\"buy now\\" button. You will NOT be sorry!
0375842209|5.0|This is the first time I review anything here since I'm usually content with other users' reviews but I just finished this book today and it was quite an experience... I started reading knowing only that it had good reviews and it was narrated by Death. When I realized the book was set during Nazi Germany in World War II I wanted to stop since I wasn't in the mood for a depressing story and the beginning of the book seemed so slow, but all those fears were put aside by this author's clever and witty style of writing and while I thought Death would be an indifferent cold narrator, it turned to be another well presented and very likeable character within the book. By the end I had my eyes swelled up with tears and not because the book was so sad but because it was just so beautiful.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I love this game! I got it awhile back when it was the FAOTD (by the way, thanks for that!). The description didn't blow me away, but I downloaded it anyway and proceeded to lose the next two hours to this app! The puzzles are fun and challenging, and the graphics are cute. Works well on both my Motorola Triumph and my Galaxy Tab 8.9. It's a great time-killer that's well worth the price!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|No problems on my evo. Days after install, breaks on kfire, I uninstall and reinstall, but my data was gone and I wasn't gonna play the first ten levels again... boring
0062082353|5.0|This book is a great read. My impression is that it was written very honestly, holding little back. Chris Kyle opens his soul as husband, father, team member, SEAL, sniper, and very human elite warrior. He does not try to portray himself as the Great American Hero or Husband of the Year. He embodies what I have come to expect from members of our elite teams, regardless of military branch. Including his wife's feelings and observations throughout the book provides a multifaceted portrait of those who endure the impact of elite-team warfare on their lives and relationships. During the period this book covers, Chris Kyle unhesitatingly gave of himself in ways most people never will, never could. I respect this man and I thank him for all the lives he saved while risking his own in the very courageous ways elite teams quietly expect of one another.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|I limit my review to the visual effects. They are very good. The planet Pandora is inhabited by humanoids that have blue skin and the stereotyped pointy ears. They also have tails, and are animated by beliefs that are a cross between animism, ancestor worship, and eastern philosophy. These humanoids ride on \\"horses\\" that resemble dwarf sauropod dinosaurs, but which breathe, insect-like, through holes on the sides of their bodies. The humanoids also tame, and ride bareback, on pterosaur-like flying creatures. All of the foregoing adds up to dramatic battles scenes against a seemingly technologically-advanced invader.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's kindle fire so it does not get damaged. She loves it and I love it! It fits the kindle perfectly and is very nicely made so it will withstand any wear and tear she may place on it.
1401937519|5.0|I saw Anita on Dr. Dyer's PBS show, and was captivated by what she was saying and how genuine she was.  I started the book this morning, and finished this evening.  I didn't want to put it down.  It has blown away many of my long held beliefs.  This book is full of truth and has been part of my journey of awakening, and becoming aware.  Previous to seeing Anita on TV, I was never interested in anyone's near death experience.
B007JUWM64|4.0|A good adventure story, a bit light, but keeps your interest.<br /><br />More of a comedic alternitive history than a closely detailed historical costume drama.<br /><br />Get out the popcorn and enjoy!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved this book!! Couldn't put it down. Larsson did a great job of bringing it all together. A strong female character who survives and rocks! About time!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|best app out there...free or paid!  this app breathes life from the Living Word! Living Water at ur finger tips...never thirst again!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing documentary. If you are on the fence trust me buy it. If you are into exotic animals and environments this blu ray can't be beat. Also all of it looks amazing in full HD!!!!!
B007EMMINY|4.0|One of the first few movies that we have rented and watched streaming via our Blue Ray player.  Amazon has done a great job with their online movie rentals.<br />Johnny English is classic \\"Bean\\" comedy with a few twists.  Don't expect some action movie, just a wholesome fun family flick!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has allowed me the study the word of God, in so many ways . I enjoy the individuals reading plans the most. I also, love the fact I can add my plan to my phone as a short cut
0618918248|5.0|Not only preaching to the Atheist choir, but presenting understandable and powerful evidence for evolution and counter-religious causes through his personal experiences and studies.
B005FITILO|4.0|I was quite happy with the way this film turned out. Diablo Cody has always interested me as a writer. I was a big fan of Juno, and say what you will, but Jennifer's Body was a very different and fun horror movie. This was more of a serious style with her own twist on it. I thought the plot was very interesting and there wasn't a dull moment throughout the movie. Charlize Theron was both excellent and stunning throughout the movie. She played this role to near perfection and was very believable. She is also a perfect example of getting better with age. Absolutely beautiful! The rest of the cast did a fairly good job in their roles as well. Patton Oswalt was awesome playing Matt, an old classmate of hers. He was hilarious and was also very believable. This is definitely one of those not known films that will grow bigger as the word gets out.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I am writing this review on 4/25/12<br /><br />I have had this product for a couple months now and I have nothing but good things to say. This is my first camera stabilizer so I knew there would be a learning curve when I made the purchase. With a little patience and some time I had the rig balanced and I'm starting to get fantastic looking shots. It's compact, light, unobtrusive and about $600 less than comparable products.<br /><br />In response to the only 1 Star review of this product:<br />The side bolts to which you referred are thumb set screws for the 2 axis plate adjustment. They are not tightened at the factory because YOU have to tighten them yourself after your stabilizer is balanced. If these are not tight the rig will never stay balanced. As with ALL stabilizers you must have patience during the balancing process. Excuse me for presuming that this is your first stabilizer but I can only draw that conclusion based on your comments. Your comment warning other buyers that \\"your dslr camera may drop\\" is 100% completely false. I have never once felt like my camera would \\"drop\\" in any way. Which leads me to believe your comments are based purely on user error and not equipment failure or design flaws. 12-4 Star ratings and 4-4 Star ratings VS. Your 1-Star rating....obviously the stabilizer isn't the problem...
B005FITIDC|5.0|First of all, I thought Relativity did a horrible job in the PR of this movie...I can't figure it out. The story is compelling and the best part is...it's a true story. The cast members do a terrific job. Gerard Butler is at his BEST in this..A must see...especially now with the Joseph Kony story being broadcasted everywhere..<br /><br />A story of One Man's War...his despair which turns around through faith and helping the children of South Africa. Sam Childers, God Bless you ! This is a story that everyone needs to see...When watching the Oscars this year, this is one movie they missed...
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moNIMVPKJWXB9K]]Just came back from my first flight!  This is my very first experience with a camera stabilizer.  If I can get these kind of results out of the gate I can only imagine what an experienced operator can do with it!
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I loved the books so much that I bought the three from the seeries. I then watched the movies and decided I liked the books better. Wish that there was a book four as I would have bought that as well.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|There is no question that Bruce Springsteen is a man of great insight, vision and, of course, musical gifts beyond most.  His diskography from his earliest recordings to this, his most recent, show a growth that has only gained maturity as he has aged.  Wrecking Ball is a composite of all his influences.  He is truly this generation's Woody Guthrie and his music on Wrecking Ball can attest to that with its patriotic messages filled with both admiration for America yet noting the frustrations and despair of the common man and his disillusionment with the rich bigwigs who could care less about America and who are only concerned with the money they get as they stamp out the life of the poor and working classes.  Instrumentally, Wrecking Ball is one of the most diverse of his albums with international music influences from Ireland and Scotland to down South country.  Clarence Clemons and his sax are sorely missed and I found it ironic that on Bruce's Jimmy Fallon Show appearance they needed many horns to fill in where one man, Clarence, would have sufficed.  Bruce's song 'We Take Care of our Own' was the first publicly played piece on the Grammy Awards show and multiple meanings can be taken from it.  Does America really take care of its own?  Maybe Bruce sees that, in fact, we don't.  Maybe only the rich take care of their own while the middle and lower economic classes suffer as shown in his other tune,' Easy Money'.  Yes, America is the land of 'Hopes and Dreams', but for too many this is an illusion.  Bruce has never wavered on his moral ground and he continues to put into words and music what others believe but cannot articulate.  There is a reason why he is called 'Boss' just as Sinatra was referred to as the 'Chairman of the Board'. Yet Sinatra was never for the common man while Bruce, despite the riches he has earned, has never lost sight of the real Americans.<br />Wrecking Ball, as an album, is not as consistant with musical themes as many of his other albums, yet is far stronger that his 'We Shall Overcome' or 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' offerings. Never the less, this album is a must buy, powerful in its direction, brilliant in its musical arrangements and touching in its sentiments.<br /><br />2nd Review...The disc has been in constant rotation since I bought it and now have other views.  While consistent with my first impressions, I feel that Bruce's folk and country influences are pushing his music in that direction leaving rock behind.  On his early albums he was always thematic in his sentiments while maintaining that powerful rock feel.  He has stayed with his ideologies and has even created them without the subtlety of many of his early songs, in fact, now he is quite clear as to where he stands on issues.  However, gone is the power, not of the lyrics, but of the music itself.  It is as if he is recreating himself as the new Pete Seeger or my previous reference to Woody Guthrie.  Gone is the real rock and roll laying down behind the lyrics.  Not sure I will keep this up front in my music collection.  You can't blame anyone for evolving but it will be a choice as to whether one will evolve in the same direction.  I will probably continue to get anything he puts out.  As I grew up I went to see most every band there was at the Filmore East in N.Y. including going to the Woodstock Festival in 69.  Sat right in the bowl up front and saw them all.  These days, I don't go to many concerts and Bruce hasn't been to San Diego in many years.  Should he come, I would definitely be first in line to buy tickets as Bruce will never lose his power or his relevancy.<br /><br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase and, if so, please let me know so that I know I am on the right path with this type of review<br />Much Thanksyet is far stronger that his 'We Shall Overcome' or 'The Ghost of Tom Joad' offerings.

0756407125|4.0|Very well written, a great continuation of the series.  My only criticism would be like others have mentioned there are a few parts that are perhaps too long.  I could have done with less about Fellurian had that shortened a bit.
0553801473|3.0|I got this book the day it came out and finished it in two. It pains me to give this three stars, but I have my reasons.<br /><br />It doesn't go anywhere. I consider A Feast For Crows to be a good addition to the series, but knowing what I do now about the state of the story after A Dance With Dragons, I don't think it was a good decision to split this segment of the story into two parts. If the extraneous details and dialogue in ADwD (of which there are far too many) were trimmed, the result would have been a book slightly longer than ADwD that covered everything in need of covering.<br /><br />I didn't feel invested in the characters. My favorite characters have always been Jaime, Daenerys, and Arya. Of the three, Daenerys was the only one of them who had frequent appearances. I've always pictured Dany as unsure of herself but strong-willed and decisive when she needs to be, which is why I was disappointed when she spent most of the book fawning over Daario and making political blunders. Jaime, if I recall correctly, had one appearance, and Arya had two. GRRM also introduced a new character who I feel was completely unnecessary. Bran's chapters felt repetitive until a certain point (no spoilers from me), and like Dany, Jon didn't really do much.<br /><br />Most of the dialogue was flat. About half-way through, I started to count how many times the characters started speaking like bad actors (I think every POV character said \\"I must needs\\" at least once) before I got bored of it and decided to start skipping lines. Normally it's a bad idea to do this for a GRRM novel, but this time I didn't feel like I missed anything.<br /><br />That said, I like me some Westeros, and while I think I dropped a bit too much money for what I got ($35 for a Hardcover), it's not like I'm going to return it. It was good as far as fantasy novels come, and I enjoyed reading it. By no means avoid reading this book, just don't except it to match up to the first three.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Downloaded this today and can't stop playing. Challenging, fun for all ages, and far better than angry birds! My husband, the gamer, keeps grabbing it from me...and I grab it right back...then have to yank it away from my teen daughter! Looking forward to taking this one on long trips.  Thanks for hours of enjoyment!
6304696566|5.0|I want to say from the start that I am not a real fan of westerns and I am not a real fan of John Wayne. I found him to be a very nice looking, likeable guy but he always played \\"John Wayne\\". BUT, in this instance, and again in True Grit, playing John Wayne is the perfect thing to do. This is a movie I've never forgotten and when, rarely, it pops up on t.v. I always watch it. It just grabs you from the first gorgeous scene of the doorway. Reading the reviews was very informative as it kept me from ordering the 2 disc anniversary version and I'm usually a sucker for those. One of the reviews said that the 2 disc version was much too dark in several places. I ordered the l997 single disc version and it was beautiful. Not as digitally remastered as maybe some later versions are. If there is anyone out there that has not seen \\"The Searchers\\" because it's an old John Wayne western, then put a copy in your cart immediately. You wont be sorry. Come to think about it, maybe John Wayne was always a better actor than I thought. In small subtle ways he told me in this movie of his great love for the murdered woman which to me was the driving force behind his obsession to find the girl. I believe that he thought of her as the only remaining link with the woman he adored. I've looked at the first few scenes of this movie several times. The interaction between \\"Martha\\" and \\"Ethan\\" is beautiful to watch. Her slowly stepping back into the doorway while unable to take her eyes off his face is genius either on her part or the part of the director. With nothing but the looks on their faces and subtle body language they both convey the great love they have for each other right up until he rides away. The scene of her standing in a room alone holding his coat and rubbing her hands over it is genius, nothing less. No  explanation is ever given of why they did not marry or how she came to be married to his brother. Great directing, possibly even greater acting. This is John Wayne's masterpiece. The only thing that I found annoying was the heavy handed humor in a few places particularly the fight scene at the wedding and Patrick Wayne's youthful blundering near the end of the movie. Maybe Papa John just wanted him in the movie. But, maybe this humor acted to keep the drama from becoming too intense. Maybe it's a true picture of how people on the frontier actually behaved. John Ford certainly knew more about directing than I do and that's for sure.  The other thing I noticed and I'm afflicted with noticing things like this. HOW ON EARTH WERE THESE PEOPLE EARNING A LIVING OUT THERE. There is no grass for cattle or horses. Nothing but dirt and a little scrub grass. Never saw a garden. Where did the wood come from to use on that rather large house and the furniture. I guess we aren't supposed to wonder about these things. If I hadn't seen it so many times I guess I wouldn't notice things like that. ADDED COMMENTS. I went against the suggestion of the person who said the 2 disc version was not very good, too dark in many places. I decided I wanted to see the extra features so ordered it. I've just looked at over half of it and do not find any problems at all with too much darkness. It seems to me to be beautifully restored and better visually than the l997 one disc version I already have. It is my opinion that the reviewer who got the too dark disc should return it for another copy. The Additional Features on the 2nd disc are wonderful and should not be missed.
B0071QIN00|5.0|one of the best apps I have ever gotten. my friend and I play it for hours. the controls are difficult at first but you get used to them.
0439023513|5.0|It only took a few hours to pour over the climactic end to the trilogy, I couldn't put it down!!  A great end to the story of the girl who is on fire.  Highly recommended!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very addictive game. Easy to play. I enjoy it very much, especially nice that it is free! Try it for yourself!
B0059XTUEK|5.0|I have never been a huge Marilyn Monroe fan. This seemed like a dumb idea for a movie, as some guy's 15 minutes of fame drawn out into one week.<br /><br />I was mesmerized by Michelle Williams' performance.  Ms. Williams got my attention with her expressive nature in Deception (with Hugh Jackman, 2008) then ripped my heart out in Blue Valentine. Now this.<br /><br />This is a \\"visual\\" movie for me. Words fail me.
1439102732|1.0|Most of the books by Jodi Picoult have been right on the mark.  This one however, after reading probably about 1/3 of it, I threw it into the trash. At this time I am reading Second Glance and am thoroughly devouring it. Too bad Jodi.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|So I bought into the hype on this. I like Lord of the Rings and fantasy and sci-fi stuff when it's done right... I watched two episodes and thought I was watching a soap opera... but it quickly took off after 3 episodes or so and became a pretty epic tale of corruption and deceit and monsters. Good stuff.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes: the battle scenes don't exist when there's more than 10 people in the battle. This is probably a budget problem, hopefully the reception of this show will increase their budget for the next season, or perhaps HBO's horrible distribution business will cause most people to pirate it off the internet. I sure hope not, because this series deserves your money and respect and I'm now crazy with anticipation for the next season.<br /><br />Too bad I don't have HBO or cable and refuse to get it, if only HBO Go was available to commoners without cable. Guess I'll wait for the next DVD release.
0345505387|3.0|First off, I was very disappointed that all the men looked nearly the same - made it annoyingly difficult to tell them apart. Most of the time, Jamie was drawn looking like a 14-year old kid, with a few exceptions.<br /><br />Secondly, the characters look FAR too Asian, especially the eyes. Yes Jamie's eyes slant, but he needs eye sockets and curly hair. The only good picture was of Ellen, as Murtagh remembered her.<br /><br />The exceptional detail given to the naked male body drawings clash with the hard, sparse lines of the rest of the characters. I wonder why...?<br /><br />Claire looked slutty with her DDD boobs hanging out - I think this artist was far too intent on giving Claire the body of his OWN fantasies.<br /><br />As an actual comic book, this would be what one would expect: I do hope Ms. Gabaldon doesn't do this to the rest of the series. JMHO
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a silly but really fun game. Since I've downloaded it I can't seem to put it down. No problems downloading or updates. Kids love tbe game and keeps them busy in the car! Just a great game!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Great band What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind cd from a unique band, this is more than awesome.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Half way through the first chapter I knew this was a book I didn't want to put down, it just grabbed me and drew me in. I found the writing to be very exciting and well crafted. when I read a book I want that emotional connection, and I felt that with this author. A delightful read!!! Highly recommended...! There is also another book I would highly recommend [[ASIN:1478324570 The Testimony of Satan]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my kid and I fight over this game. some are simple but there are the challenges also.  I still can't get the colored eggs in the same colored baskets. grrr.  only complaint is the number of ads.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie...good entertainment. Special effects were great. Hugh Jackman...well, what's not to like. My husband really liked it !
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|The Tree of Life is a beautiful film to look at but I could have done without all the prehistoric stuff, I felt that part of the movie was unneccessary. Now the acting is incredible! Brad Pitt should have been nominated for Best Actor instead of Moneyball. His performance is so real and unnerving, you can't look away even though his character is not a nice man. Jessica Chastain is a powerhouse! There is so much life in her eyes, I expect a huge and successful career for this unique and talented actress. The Tree of Life is heartbreaking, not everyone will love this film. I like this film because it's weird, full of emotion, and just very creative. Enjoy!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|defiantly get this app its so addicting and its free it works great on the kindle fire I defiantly recomemend this app
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I found it to be easy to read and understand.  I bought a John Locke book (Wish List) and was half-way into it when I realized his writing was a lot like mine...for ENTERTAINMENT, not literature. He's a genius at this and I'm right behind him.  Thanks John!  You ROCK!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this app is great I love it it works great on my kindle fire and it is free defiantly get it
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I have the flycam nano and this steadyvid is much better, easier to balance, better build quality, larger handle and great shooting.  Although the gimbal isn't completely friction free, maybe would be better with some lubrication,, you need to use the thumb holder to keep it straight around corners, but otherwise it performs great and like the micro adjustible sled design which makes it so much easier over the nano, which I will be selling that is being replaced by.  Never used a merlin but id say its very close in the way its setup, but different sled, no quick folding ability, different style of gimbal, but definitely better dollar for dollar as this one is way more affordable.  FYI, I'm flying a T2i, w/tokina 11-16m f2.8 and I used only two weights, could probably fly a little heavier no problem.
B005HSL626|4.0|this a fun addicting app it works great on the kindle fire but it has a little to many ads but overall a good app
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Absolutely love this app. I use it on my kindle fire, computer and razr to make notes for work, church, school, whatever. It works seamlessly to save and upload my notes so I can access them wherever I need. I don't even use it to its full potential ; I've been meaning to try out some of the features that allow you to attach photos and webpages.
B003X5UFWW|4.0|Unlike its sequel (Ip Man 2), this film is pretty good, and not just for its amazing fight sequences. Although most of the Japanese are one-dimensional cardboard villains, it was refreshing to see some nuance to the main antagonist. The Chinese characters are thankfully given a little more depth, and Donnie Yen and cast deliver some decent acting between fights.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have seen the stage production of Phantom six times already. I also saw the movie. I hesitated to purchase the 25th anniversary DVD as I didn't think it could do justice to the stage production...I am glad I had a change of heart, because I was wrong.It is a phenomenal production and well worth watching over and over. I even enjoyed the few changes made to enable it to be staged in such an historic location. I only wish I had been there in person.
B004X4QW42|2.0|I would probably give this a 2-star rating if I wasn't so surprised by its 4-star average here at Amazon.  First, let me say that I enjoyed the original Ip Man, which also suffered from one-dimensional cardboard villains but not to this extent. This movie takes the cardboard villain to an even stupider level of unbelievability, complete with maniacal laughter and wild-eyed gesturing. And this on top of the unbelievability of a western boxer with no prior exposure to kung fu being able to so effectively counter a fighting style he's never seen before. Finally, all of the major plot points are straight out of Rocky IV, which was a cheesy movie to begin with. I could have lived with any one of these three major weaknesses, but put them all together and you've got a really poor film.<br /><br />The end result is a shame because, like the original Rocky, the original Ip Man was an entertaining movie. Like Rocky IV, though, Ip Man 2 is mostly an uninventive cash-in on the original's success.<br /><br />=====<br /><br />Based on YJM's comment regarding western boxing (see below), I am raising my review to 2-stars. However, my main gripe was not with the matter of eastern vs. western fighting, but rather with the atrocious writing and acting. There is a world of difference between Ip Man 1 and Ip Man 2: The main antagonist in Ip Man 1 had some subtlety and nuance even though his sidekick was a one-dimensional cartoon bad guy. That's why I gave Ip Man 1 a 4-star rating. In Ip Man 2, unfortunately, ALL of the bad guys are cartoon villains straight out of looney tunes. It's a shame, really, because Donnie Yen is wonderful and did as well as he could given the hideous script and casting.
B001IF252C|5.0|Works like a champ! Plugged it in, changed my resolution and just stared in wonder. :) I was a little worried based on earlier reviews, but it works perfectly.<br /><br />UPDATE (05/03/14): As mentioned in other reviews make sure the the adapter has Firmware revision 1.03 and you won't have any issues. Verify it as soon as you open it. If it's not 1.03 return it as defective and get another. Repeat until you get one with Firmware 1.03. I've been running over a year with a Dell 30\\" monitor plugged into a 2010 13\\" Macbook Air and it works beautifully without a hitch!
B002GOAH1U|1.0|My wife and I started to watch What a Girl Wants because of Colin Firth who was fine but the movie as a whole was terrible. We struggled through about 30 minutes before switching the channel. Amanda Bynes was extremely irritating as the daughter. This movie is about on a par with the teen shows on the Disney Channel. I am very disappointed because the premise was good but the execution was not.
B000FZETIO|5.0|Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald) is a kid from the wrong side of the tracks. She's a self-confident high-school senior who dresses in handmade clothes, works in a record store, and lives in a modest home with her unemployed father (Harry Dean Stanton). Times are tough for Andie in school, where she and her friends are tormented by the wealthy students who make up the majority of the student body, and where her worst fear is that she won't get invited to the senior prom. Her best friend, \\"Duckie\\" (Jon Cryer), talks matter-of-factly with her father about marrying Andie, but he never thinks of taking her to the prom--a social event that most of the poor kids avoid. To her surprise, she is asked to go to the dance by the charming Blaine (Andrew McCarthy), who's not as snobbish as the rest of his elitist friends. As in all of John Hughes's films, PRETTY IN PINK touches a chord with today's teens (as well as anyone who has been that age), but at the same time seems to pander somewhat to the audience's expectations. Interestingly, however, the finest moments in PRETTY IN PINK come not from the script by Hughes, but from Howard Deutch's careful direction. While the script contains trite and unbelievable dialogue, the superbly convincing performances make up for these faults
B006VZS1EA|5.0|I really liked the movie, beibg a SIFI buff. Story line not bad at all I was hooked from the beginning.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|I had the Angel Care motion/video/audio monitor on my registry, then changed my mind after learning that products such as those can't actually help prevent SIDS.  I'm a doctor, should have known that, but it's so easy to buy into the hype.  Instead I set out to find a monitor that allowed me to see my baby on my iPhone.  The Withings monitor does it!  And I love that I can use the battery power and easily move it around the house to where she is (e.g., in bassinet in the kitchen).
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Update- March 15, 2012.  An unbelievable tragic set of circumstances just took place, and the timing is quite bizarre to say the least.  After writing this review yesterday, I was informed by my father through a phone call that our basset hound would have to be put to sleep the next day (today) because he's old and his health suddenly took a major turn for the worse.  It's just really strange that I'd listen to this Al Stewart album for the very first time before being aware a close family death was right around the corner.  Even more bizarre is that I'd mention how a song like \\"Time Passages\\" makes me feel at peace with growing older.  Right now however, I feel nothing but sadness.  No peace at all given the news that my 14-year old dog had just died.  So I guess \\"Time Passages\\" is only peaceful when you're not being hit with sudden tragic news.  The song works a LOT better when you're sitting alone in your bedroom and wondering about time moving forward (and the inevitable conclusion) in THAT kind of setting with no recent deaths causing a distraction.  Anyway, the rest of the review is right below this paragraph, and I didn't change a thing despite the events that occurred earlier today.<br /><br />I actually AM really surprised- I never would have guessed that Al Stewart is such a solid songwriter capable of writing *albums* worth of quality material- not just a few songs here and there (which is what I originally wondered).<br /><br />Overall, Time Passages lives up to the hype.  It's probably not *quite* in the same category as Year of the Cat because the songwriting is ever slightly more generic here, and please, when I say \\"generic\\" I actually don't mean it in a negative way at all.  Maybe it would be more appropriate to say these songs are more restrained and less experimental and daring.  Either way, I LOVE the entire album.  Songwriting THIS exceptional can't be dismissed or underrated.<br /><br />Even hearing the album a couple times, the title song remains my favorite.  I just love the way the vocal melody rolls forward in a peaceful way, indicating that even though time goes forward and we all experience the change of life, it's not really a bad thing at all.  It's a normal and natural part of life.  Al really makes you believe this due to his calm singing demeanor.  In fact, on a personal note, lyrics matching a great vocal melody such as this actually makes growing older for me personally not seem so bad.  I've always HATED growing older, but... at least \\"Time Passages\\" makes the process bearable.  Now when a band like Procol Harum gives me the same vibes, I feel like crying instead.  MAJOR difference between the two artists.  I love Procol Harum all the same.<br /><br />Speaking of Procol Harum, \\"The Palace of Versailles\\" reminds me of \\"A Salty Dog\\" or \\"Grand Hotel\\" a little bit.  A vocal melody that flows peacefully and delightfully- if you ask me it would be quite difficult to dislike a song like this.  Al Stewart's lyrics are wonderful once again.  \\"Our time is wasting in the wind, wondering why it echoes through the lonely palace of the Versailles\\".  Just the way Al sings the melody seems so natural.  Makes me wonder how long he sits around writing music.  It would seem, by listening to this album for example, that it takes the man no time at all to come up with fantastic songwriting ideas.  He's naturally talented.<br /><br />\\"Life In Dark Water\\" really DOES capture the feeling of being alone at the bottom of the sea, worried that everyone has done forgotten about your existence as you're forced to stick around down there.  Will anyone remember you when you're gone?  The vibes here are MUCH darker than the rest of the album.  Must be the feeling of loneliness giving me such an overwhelming feeling.  Or maybe my fear of water and the oceanic life.  \\"A Man For All Seasons\\" doesn't have much of a vocal melody truth be told, but this goes back to what I was saying above- despite sounding generic, Al Stewart STILL gives his music a special touch of *something* (perhaps layers of wonderful lyrics) that can make listeners forgot that it sounds typical of a late 70's album and focus on his songwriting instead.<br /><br />\\"Song on the Radio\\" should definitely have been a huge hit in America.  It just has that late 70's commercial style and the vocal melody chugs along in a mid-tempo, memorable way that should have won over the majority back then.  Sadly it never happened.  Well perhaps the saxophone solo in the middle is a little overdone, but other than that I have zero complaints.  Oh, and I realize this song was actually a minor hit, but I've never once heard it on the radio in all the years (20+) I've been listening to it.<br /><br />As for the rest of the material... \\"Valentina Way\\" and \\"Almost Lucy\\" are fast-paced tracks but actually contain a fair amount of emotional energy as well.  It sends odd feelings to me because I actually feel like crying when I hear these two songs.  I can't tell you whether it's tears of sadness or happiness though.  \\"Timeless Skies\\" reminds me of Jethro Tull's late 70's more folkish period, and \\"End of the Day\\" sums up a wonderful album on a mellow and jazzy note.  The instrumental jazzy portion is pretty good but the melody is even better.<br /><br />Overall, Al Stewart going commercial was actually a very good thing because Year of the Cat and Time Passages have stood the test of time.  I recommend picking them up.

B005NKGEP2|4.0|The expats is an entertaining story which I enjoyed, but it is not a typical action packed spy thriller.<br /><br />Kate is a former CIA agent living as an expat in Luxembourg after her husband, Dexter, receives an offer to be an network security consultant for a bank (he is deliberately vague about who his employer and clients are).<br /><br />Kate soon meets another expat wife, Julia.  Julia and her husband, Bill, become good friends with Kate & Dexter.  At that point, Kate begins to suspect that Julia and Bill are hiding something and she is unsure if it has to do with her CIA past or her husband's mysterious job.<br /><br />As I mentioned, there is not a lot of action in this story.  It is written from Kate's point of view and the twists come as Kate figures them out.  Much of the story revolves around Kate's internal struggles with trust and her past actions.  I actually found Kate to be a very believable and relatable character.  While she is ex-CIA, something that is not particularly relatable, she is also a wife and a mom who is struggling with trying to make a new life with her family, while simultaneously keeping secrets and suspecting that her husband is doing the same.<br /><br />The story switches between two time periods, but there are also multiple flashbacks to other time frames.  Most of the story takes place when the family first moves to Luxembourg, but there is also a story thread that takes place in present day Paris 2 years later.  Eventually the first storyline catches up to the second.  While I was able to keep up with the time switching, it did take some concentration.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this story and think it would make a great beach read.  Although it is a spy thriller, I think it is definitely targeted more towards female readers who will relate to Kate and her internal struggles, rather than readers who prefer a lot of action in their thrillers.

B005SFR7YE|5.0|Ramin Karimloo is simply amazing as The Phantom! Sierra Boggess was only slightly annoying as Christine - her facial expressions drove me crazy!<br /><br />I wasn't quite prepared for the emotional tug from the final scenes in the lair... Ramin had me in tears as he fought the pain of being rejected, yet again. His performance is the first to bring tears to my eyes!<br /><br />BTW... what was with the make-up/mask on Ramin? Looked like large pieces of \\"skin\\" would fall off of his face and neck at any moment. Why would they over look that?<br /><br />Two roles seemed miscast: 1) The lady who played Meg Giry was just painful! Way too old and turned the part into a very annoying one. 2) Did not like this Raoul one bit! Patrick Wilson will forever be my all-time favorite Raoul!<br /><br />The call-outs at the end were a little uncomfortable. Too many Phantoms each trying to out-do the other. Sarah Brightman seemed more of a caricature of herself, and the over-flaunted Michael Crawford just stood there looking goofy. (I can't look at or listen to him without thinking of him in 'Hello Dolly!')<br /><br />BUT this is The Phantom of the Opera, which is always a treat!!! Ramin Karimloo made this production even more so!! Just can't seem to make myself give it any less than 5 stars!

0307591549|2.0|I found the metaphors used simplistic, unintuitive and hard to remember. After reading Flourish (Seligman), I could recite the principles and main ideas without going back to the table of contents. With this book, I found it hard to remember was a chapter was about after a few days even while looking at the table of contents and actually had to refer to my own summary.<br /><br />A couple of ideas in this book are interesting but not necessarily related to positive psychology per se:<br /><br />- 'the Tetris Effect', meaning that you see what you expect to see based on experience.<br />- the 'Zorro Circle', meaning that to solve overwheliming problems, try to control what you can easily control first, move to more difficult challenges next.<br />- the '20 second rule', better described as 'if you trying to pick up a habit, do everything you can to stick to it for the first 20 days or so' - put the guitar in the middle of the room, take the batteries out of the remote, or sleep in your gym clothing.<br /><br />There were more chapters, but I really forgot what for instance the fulcrum one was really about.<br /><br />All in all, a forgettable book.<br /><br />The only worse book I've so far read on Positive Psychology is<br />One Day University Presents: Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness (Harvard's Most Popular Course) by the same Author.<br /><br />For 99c you can get the excellent and very concise article Optimal Functioning: A Positive Psychology Handbook [Kindle Edition]<br />Jessica Colman (Author)<br /><br />Or for a more amusing read: The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom by Haidt, Jonathan
0385344228|4.0|I have read many \\"legal, courtroom mystery thrillers\\" - which is why I may have kept this from \\"five stars\\" - from that standpoint, it is fairly routine, a bit dragged out, somewhat predictable with the usual set of characters.  What really sets this book on a higher level, is the outstanding premise and execution of that idea - leading to a very stunning conclusion!  Well worth the read.  The format of the book is interesting, as you have several legal testimonies in progress - I think this keeps the reader focused and somewhat comfortable in the direction of the plot, but also somewhat aware, that not all is what it seems...<br />Well done!!
0553807919|5.0|My toddler is a handful, totally strong willed and thinks the word \\"no\\" is an invitation to continue doing what he is doing. This book taught me how to talk to him in a way that makes him make the decision to listen. This book taught me a way to connect to my child instead of yelling and getting angry. I like how the book is not too pushy about its ideas. The book guides you into making your own plan of raising a child. We have implemented many of the ideas in the book and our home is much happier and I feel like we all understand each other much better. I plan to re-read it soon to brush up on the ideas. I highly recommend.
032147404X|5.0|I expected this to be a book addressing the fundamentals of digital photography.  It is not.  Instead it gives you tips & shortcuts to get the results you want.  It does not explain how to use light, the exposure triangle, or most other technical details.  It does say things like \\"Shoot with a tripod\\" or \\"Buy this if you can afford it. If not, buy (or use) this.\\" or \\"Open it in Photoshop & apply this filter with these settings\\" with very little explanation of what you are really doing.  Fabulous for someone who just wants to make their shots look better.  Not so great for someone really trying to learn the finer points of photography.  Even tho I fall into the 2nd category, I loved this book.  It will give you immediate results while you are still learning the technical details you must find elsewhere.
B007IQX1G4|5.0|Boy this movie reminds me of the good and bad days of high school in the 1990's.  During the whole movie you can't help but think of your own high school days and the sadness around the good times of your past leaving you and the surprises the future holds.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who went to high school in the 1990's (oh yeah the music in this movie is great too!)
B0052VUNHC|1.0|Okay, so not a great work of literature, but I wasn't looking for great literature when I purchased this book.  And there are plenty of books that will never be compared to Tolstoy or Faulkner which are thoroughly captivating, engaging and magical.<br /><br />This book angers me on a number of levels.  Not necessarily for the messages of violence and emotional abuse that can be inferred, which have already been so eloquently fleshed out by other reviewers.  Nor for the related vitriol between haters of the book, lovers of the book, and the author.  The book pisses me off for more than anything because it is so poorly done.  It was, in short, the worst f-ing book I've ever read.<br /><br />There are a number of problems with this book.  The writing is basic and I found the author used some of the same phrases over and over - to the point where it got annoying.  Between that and the bland diagogue - a lot of which was irrelevant - the strained metaphors, the awkward phrases and even just down to word choices and grammar usage, there were a lot of speed bumps.<br /><br />The use of first-person here was also problematic.  The narrator had way too much insight on other characters and interpreting their expressions, yet never clearly articulated her own thoughts and feelings (but more on that below).<br /><br />The pacing was ridiculous.  By the end of the book, not only had the two main characters only known each other for only 6 months, but they were only officially a couple for a grand total of about 5 weeks.  What?!?!?!  This happened with other aspects too.  For instance, the best friend was already spending nights at her boyfriend's house in the beginning of the book, when AT BEST she's known him 3 weeks.  In 3 weeks they met, courted and are BF/GF?  In college?????  Who here went to college and was in a committed relationship 3 weeks later?  Nobody?  Oh okay.<br /><br />The story lines are also ridiculous.  Parker is buying her diamonds (buying her anything, really) after their second date?  This is just not how people, let alone college kids, really act.  There's one scene where Travis, who is at most a junior, is carrying around $2500 in his wallet.  At a frat party.  I almost threw my kindle away after that.  I get that she's trying to create scenes that demonstrate conflict, but even after factoring in the absurdity that is all things college, it's just too much.<br /><br />And on a related note, there are just holes in the story and randomness for seemingly no reason.  [SPOILER ALERT]  Abby's supposed to be a good girl that hung in \\"tamer circles\\" but the only friends she ever had in the whole book was America.  Where are her other friends?  And how did she not know she had a class with the big man on campus?  And what exactly was the purpose of the fire?  Where did her father go?  How convenient is it that everyone in college eats lunch at the same time?  And again - Travis is Shep's cousin, who is America's boyfriend.  Why has Abby never met him before?  Supposedly America's parents more or less raised Abby (even though they'd only been friends since jr year of high school) but she feels like Travis's dad is more her family than the people that let you live with them?  After meeting him twice?<br /><br />There were a number of scenes that were so contrived it was painful.  Like, it physically hurt. Just one example: the author wanted to create a drama where Abby catches Travis with another girl.  So the backstory involved in her willingly going to her ex-boyfriend's house is just absurd.  If you're all torn up over your ex, you don't go to your house so your BFF will have company on the 10 minute drive over there so she can go get something she left.  And why was America pissed that Travis brought a girl home?  Not I'm-on-my-friends-side pissed, but I-hate-you-and-someone-has-to-pull-me-off-of-you pissed.  He hadn't done anything wrong.<br /><br />All of these things like that are distractingly unrealistic and/or justplain stupid, and while each instance is not enough to make you stop reading (well, until Vegas, but I managed to power through), it has the cumulative effect of making you realize how absurd the story is.  Plus, while I've only given a few examples, things like this happen A LOT throughout the book.  Every few pages you're going \\"who would do that?\\" or other assorted \\"WTF\\".  I shouldn't have to work this hard to overlook all of these things to try to get to the heart of the story.<br /><br />But, and I think this was the biggest problem with the book, the character development is poor.  Travis was probably the most fleshed out, though I think the beating-up-every-guy-that-looked-at-her was a bit too extreme for my taste.  I know it's been said before, but seriously, where the hell were campus security/the police?  And why does no one (except me apparantly) think this dude is off his rocker?  But, you at least knew that he was going to do whatever over-the-top thing he could think of to keep Abby around.<br /><br />Travis is an extreme character.  Which I did not enjoy, but apparently others did.  But at least he was consistent in being extreme.  Fine. The rest of the characters, including Abby, weren't consistent at all.  It's one thing to be a confused teenager, but you really just felt like the other characters would do whatever it took to create drama in the story, not what their \\"personality\\" (if they had one) would do.  From one page to the next, you don't know if America is going to be rooting for Travis or telling Abby to stay away. I think she flip flops about 5 or 6 different times.  America follows Abby to college to keep an eye on her, then encourages her (sometimes) to go after what she's supposed to be staying away from.  Huh?  Parker's a pretty boy, why does he keep testing Travis (and for that matter, why doesn't Travis ever knock him out - he's done worse for far less Crimes Against Abby)?<br /><br />Related to that, one of the fundamental rules ofwriting is Show Don't Tell.  Don't just say \\"Sue was beautiful\\" - describe what she looks like, and how people react to her.  With respect to why the characters were who they were, it was all Tell Don't Show.  So Abby just says Travis reminds her of her dad, but really, we don't know why.  She has daddy issues, but it's sort of just like \\"well, my dad gambled and so I'm gonna go for the brooks brother type\\".  Travis clearly has demons, but we're left to guess as to what they are (his mom?) and why he's running from them.  How can I root for Travis if I don't even have a hint at the life reasons that are making him act like this?  Or is he just bat-s*** insane?  Why do I want her to pick more stable Parker if as far as I can tell his only motivation is to stick it to Travis?  And Abby?  I don't know who she should be with (if anyone) or why I'm supposed to feel that way, other than Travis is hot and he treats her better (arguably) than the other girls.<br /><br />Of course, in not every book are you going to understand all the characters.  But for me, I have to get at least ONE of them.  And if it's going to be in first person, that's the person I need to relate to.  But here it was never made clear what makes even one of the characters tick (beyond obligatory one or two sentences thrown in to clue you in \\"I could tell he thought that it was just something about the two of us together that was so special\\"), so the book failed for me on this front.  Again, this all just comes down to a bad writing style.<br /><br />Unlike other readers, I will say I didn't have a problem with the story of a dysfunctional relationship per se.  There's always an intangible factor as to why two people are drawn to one another, and I am willing to give credit that for whatever reason, each of these two sparked something in the other, though I fully concede that the author does not shed any light on why.  Others had problem with the blatant messages of violence being sexy, women who havesex outside of relationships as being sluts or otherwise deserving to be treated poorly and, because it bears repeating, violence being sexy.  Silly, lightweight books, the rom-coms of the publishing world, are filled with bad messages.  I wouldn't want any of the teenagers in my life to read this [NOTE: I'm still not sure if it's supposed to be a YA book or not - to be fair the author says it's not, but if it's not I'm not sure who the target audience would be], but I can't act like it's the only book out there that sends a bad message.  And as a fully grown adult sometimes I look for books in which I can escape into a fantasy of love.<br /><br />Abby's two main suitors are terrible representaions of love. One thinks he can buy her and the other thinks he can beat up anyone who looks at her.  All terrible qualities which other readers are justified in being appalled by.  Here's the thing though, there are real life people like Travis and Abby and Parker.  There are men who are controlling, there are women who will string a man (men, as the case here) along, and there are men who think they can buy affection.  The fact that those qualities were present in these characters is not per se a bad thing.  A book about self-destructive people in a codependent relationship could be a very interesting read, and I don't begrudge this book for creating a story about people like this.<br />However, this book fails in its entirety when it GLAMORIZES this behavior.  It's not just \\"here's a story about two crazy kids in love let's watch them go down in flames\\", it's \\"here's a story about two crazy kids in love AND ISN'T IT ROMANTIC?\\"  Don't you find it only mildly annoying when your bf starts a fight in a bar because someone smiled at you? Yeah, sure.  We laugh about it all the time...<br /><br />What the entire hell?!  Rather than a detached perspective about the trials and tribulations of dealing with a passive aggressive gf, or a manipulative alcoholic boyfriend, it's presentedin such a way that the reader is expected to buy into and root for this, and that's ultimately where it jumps the shark for me.<br /><br />I had to give it two stars because I must admit I found it quite the page turner. But I say that as an adult who has already lived my version of good girl/bad boy love.  And honestly, it's a popular romantic theme, I begrudge no author for attempting this.  I dated the big shot on campus who manipulated his way into my life and tried to control who I saw and how and when.  good times....  So for me I was able to go back and remember that time and separate what I thought was love from the other nonsense. For young people who are living/haven't yet lived that time - or for older readers who were lucky enough to avoid Travis types - this romanticizes deeply disturbing behaviors from a bunch of lost kids who need lots and lots of therapy and doesn't do a good enough job of explaining how they got to there respective psych issues in the first place.<br /><br />One reviewer said learn to treat this book like some silly movie you'd watch.  I tend to like my reading to have more substance and quality (even my light-hearted reads).  But there are just too many problems: the writing and the completely irrelevant dialogue and the plot holes and the non-existent character development were just too much.  The failures of this book both in style and in substance far outweigh brielfly reliving a misspent youth. Find another way to pass the time.

And someone robs her of her phone and she finds a new one in the bin. \\"Finders keepers\\" and that is the beginning of the phone-sharing arrangement with Sam. Add a few additional plots, a lot of laughter, a tiny mystery, sigh-worthy hero moments and a big chunk of personal growth and you have an amazing book. It is by far her least believable book (yes even Twenties Girl with a ghost as one of the main characters is more believable) but if you can ignore that for a couple of hours, then you're in for a treat.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Here I am, over an hour past when I intended to go to bed, because I just couldn't leave the Silo until I knew how everything turned out.<br /><br />Like so many others, I came here from Boingboing.  I saw the reviews, saw the average rating, and decided that $5 is not a huge risk, really, when a book is getting near-universal acclaim, even if I had never heard of the author.  I was so excited about it, I shifted around my reading queue and hopped straight to this from some Iain M. Banks books.<br /><br />The first book - novella, really - grabbed my attention.  It was excellent, and left me with a feeling of, \\"Huh.  Well, where does he go from here?\\"  And it was purely remarkable.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, I hope, the first two parts are almost prologues - but it's all intricately related from the first page to the last.  What I'd consider the main story kicks in about 15% or so of the way in, and from there ... wow, it's just intense.  The characterization is rich, the story-telling is masterful, and the setting is both unique and deep.  There's mysteries upon mysteries, and we get enough perspectives that everyone's actions make sense.  In short, the book feels almost peculiarly *honest* in a way that a lot of fiction - especially sci-fi - doesn't, always.<br /><br />The only note I would have for the author/formatter is that I wish there were a workable table of contents; as it is, the five sections are just in a big blob of ebook without demarcation.  This was fine, in practice - I mean, I had no desire to skip ahead! - but finding my way around if I want to go back to a section will be difficult.<br /><br />Regardless, I can't recommend this book highly enough.  It's a steal for $5.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a great app. Keeps you wanting not to stop. I have been enjoying the challenges. Would recommend it.
1932100660|5.0|It's an easy to read, impressive body of work, by authors with excellent credentials. The general theme that our health can be VERY positively influenced by a more vegetarian diet is just one more piece of strong evidence to that effect following the Mediterrian Diet and The Okinawa Program.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I bought the ad-free version because the free version was so much fun EXCEPT for the ads.  Now with the March 2012 upgrade the ad-free version has so-called rewards...points that add up for discounts on crap I do not want or need.  In other words, I've PAID for ad-free and now I've got ad-filled: sometimes offers will pop up during game play and interrupt the game; the point meter pops up after every completed game; periodically a message flashes to GO NOW TO THE MARKETPLACE;  and web site ads show up as well.  This is almost as annoying and pervasive as the free version.

B002NLY0V4|5.0|If you like to indulge in fantasy, the Supernatural series is an addictive delight, as evidenced by its well-deserved cult following. Start with Season 1 and enjoy the ride. The boys' quest explores a universe of myths, legends, fables and scary creatures of all kinds. It's a delicious combination of action, shock, violence, pop culture references, black humor, classic rock, and beautiful bad boys with hearts of gold. Think Die Hard meets Van Helsing meets Jason and the Argonauts with a side of Firefly. You won't see many women here (they come and go like fruit flies), but the characters are easy to relate to, and the combination of humor and angst is irresistible. The production quality and effects get increasingly better as the series progresses, so don't let the green screen glitches and sometimes clunky acting in the first season put you off. I highly recommend the entire series.
B002IFT1ZA|3.0|the series was highly anticipated, yet lacked the depth, intensity, realism, and grit of its contemporaries: rome, sparticus, band of brothers. i am a stickler for realism or believability and game of thrones was lacking...not because its fantasy (lord o the rings did it well) but because of lack of attention to detail, coherence of plot, sterile sex/ battle scenes (merely \\"insert sex/battle scene here\\" rather than a passionate build up, causality or quality interplay). the whole thing smacked of a trailer for something else more brilliant....lots of interesting \\"what ifs\\" that were never really addressed, i guess thats for season 2. the knights of the black? total joke...like you are going to create a trustworthy, honorable legion of highly trained bad-asses that the whole civilized world depends on for protection from the dregs (not to mention fat mammas boys) of other kingdoms, rather than a select few whose qualities merit there post. another point of notice: almost all of the kings/ lords get killed whilst their female counterparts survive, placing them in position to make the moves...great, looks like season 2 will be a middle-earth \\"sex in the city\\"...pointless. \\"women can rule!\\" you say? well, that is true but to merely replace all the male leadership with females is implausible, unrealistic, and frankly boring.  an even mix keeps things balanced and believable. matter of fact, a eunuch has more masculinity in this milktoast epic than sean bean's grizzled and apathetic character.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|One of my favorite mind games.  Challenging but not too challenging. Like Quell, it puts your mind to work. Worth the money.
1423136802|5.0|My son,who is 10,really enjoyed these books he read them back to back. We saw the movie and he found out that there were books that told more of the Percy Jackson story.He's never been a big reader, only books he had to read for school, so I was excited when he asked for this box set. He said that they were not too scary and that he understood that all the different gods and idols were never real but just part of Greek mythology. We are looking to get the next set of books called \\"The Heros of Olympus\\"
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I am not a book \\"reviewer\\" so if you want a typical review with plot outline and insight, I will disappoint but what I can give is the honest thoughts on this book from a real person. I received a copy of this e-book from the author during a giveaway she sponsored.<br /><br />It seems so many books these days are geared toward the paranormal but not like this one. Rebecca takes a group of interesting, relate-able characters and spins a story that draws you in completely. She defined the characters and the story in such a way that only made you want to know more. This book kept me awake late a night more than once because I just did not want to put it down.<br /><br />I have gushed over this book to anyone who will listen to me and recommend it to all my friends and family.<br /><br />If I did not know this was Rebecca's debut novel, I never would have known she was a new author. Her book smacks of talent and I eagerly await book 2.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Show is obviously amazing. The video and audio are excellent. I'm mainly here to rave about the packaging: the packaging looks superb with beautiful character portraits in the flip-out disc holder. The discs are in the old-school plastic design where you press the center to be able to pull the disc out. I prefer this design vs the fancier stuff (I had a bluray get scratched in the Rome set where you have to slide the disc out of a sleeve). This design does take up more space since this one season ends up in a package about the same size as my entire series set for Rome.<br /><br />One small thing on my wishlist: Episode 6 has a detailed making-of-the-episode, but I wish more episodes had this type of breakdown explaining how they did the CGI, stunts, and filming. There's also a half-hour \\"making of\\" feature on the final disc that talks about the entire season and includes some clips that were deleted from the final cut.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty entertaining to pass time for either yourself or your kids.  challenging and have plenty of different games for all tastes.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|I had purchased this DVD collection for my sister (who is an avid Harry Potter fan) as a Christmas present. We had a marathon event over the next few days and watched the entire series! They were a good quality, and the price was very affordable - much less than in retail stores.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I bought these and received them last thursday. Ive used them for about 20 hours so far. The first time i used them, the base was near my router and the was some hissing and pops. The next night i moved it about 10 feet away. I havent heard one pop or hiss since. It is now crystal clear! Ive used it for Xbox 360 and movies. I did however swap the crappy toslink cable with a nice mediabridge one i had.

B006UG90RM|3.0|Big Van Halen fan and was definitely excited that they were using older material like Big Trouble turning into Big River and Shes The Woman etc..however the album really didn't hit me (except a couple songs) for a couple of reasons--<br /><br />1. Brown sound is completely absent--Eddie is CLEARLY not using his old Marshall Plexi. No Plexi, no brown sound. Impossible to recreate otherwise, sorry can't happen bruh. That amp's tone is 1/2 of what MADE Ed who he is. You can't just stick a phase pedal on any ol amp and call it brown sound!<br />2. Dave's voice has reverted back to being really strained as it was in the 90's, starting with ALAE. Shame, he was really gettin his groove back on the '07 tour.<br />3. They should've recorded all analog, this isn't Seether or some other modern rock band being produced, its VAN HALEN..the volume doesnt need to be clipped and distorted. VH fans will do that our dang selves :)<br /><br />Albums like this are a reminder that playing rock n roll specifically should not be a lifetime thing. There's usually a shelf life from when you're still fresh and cool to when just going through the motions just to make a buck for your next drug fix. The Beatles bowed out right on time. The Stones didn't. Generally it is true--after 30 you gotta go off and do something else musically instead of ruining your cred. But, Dave and the VH brothers split slightly before their time because Dave's voice hadn't crapped out until 1990 or so and the musical side of 5150 and OU812 sound like perfect companions to 1984. Take out Sammy and his bad lyrics and yeah...those 3 albums HAD to have been written from pieces created during the same time as 1984. You'd be crazy not to notice the similarities.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Sound is decent for the price. It's a lot better than hearing through TV speakers. The mic is consistent, but the control is placed at a bad spot making it not quite clip to my chair or my shirt. But all the faults can be overlooked, except for the fact that the right ear piece is ridiculously flimsy. First pair I bought, broke within 4 months, but I had dropped that pair and thought the fall was responsible. I've had a replacement for about 5 months now, and today, in the middle of a FPS match, the right ear snapped for no reason. I wasn't touching or moving them in any way. Same spot as the first time, except all I did this time was WEAR THEM. And I had treated the second pair gingerly the entire time, never dropped them once, never even hung them up like I did the last pair, to prevent unnecessary stress on the headphone joint. All in all, very poor construction.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this book was great! I had to then get the sequel to read immediately.  I am now impatiently waiting for the movie to come out.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|The screen cover is just impossible to put right, but the case by itself makes it a 5-star product, it protects the phone very well and it doesn't add too much weight, it's a must for this phone
B004LWZW8I|1.0|Bland as can be. Atrocious story build-up. The gods looked right out of 90210, no thrones, no gold, these guys were slumming it. Why in the hell is there an American (the guy from Blade) in this Greek myth? The landscapes were absent, instead we get the 300 backgrounds that lacked scenery.

0441013597|3.0|Herbert's creation of Dune is monumental, to say the least. The appendixes were lengthy, but I appreciated their inclusion--and used them regularly. This did however slow the novel's movement down when added to the author's overly plodding diction. While I enjoyed the book, I was semi-relieved to finish it.

1400069289|5.0|After I heard Duhigg interviewed on Fresh Air my expectations for The Power of Habits were high ... my lofty hopes were thoroughly met by this brilliant, informative and well-written description of habit formation based on neurological research.  By demonstrating the high level of success advertising has achieved in creating and changing consumer patterns,Duhigg draws the reader into a personal/internal journey finding their own keystone habits and learning how to change patterns. I loved this book for the information and the changes I've made as a result of my reading of it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book kept popping up on my reccomnedations for my kindle, and one day I decided to give it a chance a read it. I am so happy that I decided to give this book a chance. It had me pulled in from the very beginning and never let me go until the end. Even then I kept coming back to this book and rereading it. This story shows two people who each bring issues of their own to the table but always find a way to overcome them. Some people believe that this book shows an abusive relationship and should not be read. I respect their opinions but i no way is their abuse in this book. I agree that Travis has anger issues and he needs to work on them but he never once verbally or physically hurt Abby. He loved her and tried to do anything he could to make her happy. Did he sometimes slip into being possessive? Absolutley. There is a huge difference between abusive and possessive. This is an AMAZING book and is definitley one I reccomend you take a chance on and read!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great fun. Good range of settings for all levels of skill makes this playable for all ages. Pop up adds a little annoying.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game. Graphics are great and play is smooth. I love it and play it everyday! If there are more games, sign me up!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app seems to read your mind.  It's way beyond autocorrect or autocomplete, although it does that as well.  Instead of instantly changing a word for you it gives you 3 matches it thinks you're looking for.  The most likely word to use is in the middle, highlighted and if you hit the space bar it will use that word or you can touch one of the others to select them or you can continue typing to get to a completely different selection(s).<br /><br />The way it accomplishes all this is by reading (whatever you allow) your email, text, Facebook and tweets.  It learns your style of writing.  It really is an amazing replacement for the standard keyboard. Oh and you can still use voice to text as well.<br /><br />Happy texting and remember, don't text and drive. I would prefer not to be killed while you are texting someone.
B003Y5HWMW|1.0|Never kill off the actor that is the only reason people watch the show in the first place in the first season. Same reason Jericho and countless others were canceled. Stupid decision.
B000M39HB8|5.0|Great way to buy Movie content.  The quality of the video was as good or better than expected.  Of course, delivery was nearly instantaneously.
1597801585|5.0|The Windup Girl is one of the more fascinating and compelling science fiction novels I've read in recent times.  The story stays, as I continue to think about it from time to time.  A near-future that seems almost possible...  an adventure story that carries one through an understanding of Thai culture through the lens of imagination. At first I found myself unsure about how I felt about Anderson. As the story progressed, I welcomed his uniqueness. The windup girl herself, Emiko, was absolutely ethereal and captivating.
0857680986|5.0|So I purchased this book after reading Mythology: The DC Comics Arts of Alex Ross in which i discovered that Alex Ross studied Andrew Loomis' book in order to improve both his shading and anatomy. The book arrived on time. I've never purchased an art book before but I was surprised to find out just how easy it was to follow. From learning about shading and how it applies to the human figure to creating form and learning how to apply it on a live model this book was truly a guide into anatomy drawing. I am currently in my first anatomy class and to my surprise my teacher uses a lot of the measurements and technique that Loomis sets for the reader. The book was written in the era of commercial art so Loomis refers to it a lot in the book but regardless it helps the reader understand how he came up with the ideas that he shares and on how to apply them to his own style. Loomis does a great job in guiding the reader instead of commanding him/ her about techniques or tips. I would recommend this book to anybody who is starting to get into figure drawing or who wants to improve their art, overall.
B006YMM64G|5.0|What a great message. Reminder that we as men have a responsibility to our families. Highly recommended. We rented the movie on our Roku.
031265068X|3.0|I cannot review this book, as it was a gift. It was however listed as a hardcover and is definitely a paperback.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|There is so much to write positively about the charm of this book. However, I find the most delight I receive is in the clever phrases and word usages. It is a kind, long poem to my ears.<br /><br />Naturally, I do like Elizabeth as well. She is very human. She has the ability to make mistakes, to learn from them, and to realize her hubrus and change. I don't find this very often in modern works.<br /><br />I return to this book from time to time to retreat from life. It has become an old soothing friend to me!
0553807919|5.0|This book was recommended to me, and with a very active and emotional 3 year old boy, I jumped on the opportunity to glean any advice and knowledge that came highly recommended. As I started reading The Whole-Brain Child and learned about the left-brain/right-brain characteristics and how our brain really functions in our emotional development, I knew that I would be learning much more than strategies revolving less than pleasant behaviors of a small child.  Because The Whole-Brain Child details the descriptions of the right (emotional) brain, and left (logical) brain, I have been able to identify and connect with both my husband and my child in ways that I have not been able to before.  It's also allowed me to understand myself in a way that has never been clearer.  Along with 12 strategies that are given to deal with problems or situations that arise, this book has really empowered me in a way that I truly never expected. As a graduate student, I am always finding ways to educate myself beyond my limits, and this has truly inspired me dive deeper into mindsight and the developing mind.  You can't go wrong with this book.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Add me: Xanpulo<br /><br />Fun game if you like time management style games. Can be repetitive if you don't like to take the time to do the tasks required. I will gift daily!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Maybe it would do what I wanted, but I couldn't find help on-line to figure it out.  It wouldn't read anything but kindle books and I have others but I couldn't find them on my pad.  I thought it might be an issue but gave it a shot anyway - looks like I was right.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|My family went to see Courageous at the theater with a group of friends, and everyone agreed that it was not just one of the best Christian movies we'd ever seen, but one of the best movies, period.  If you are part of a family, then you need to see this movie!  Even if you don't have children or your children are grown, or you have grandchildren or just act as a second parent/grandparent to someone else's kids, this movie will touch your heart and teach you a lot about families and communication and safeguarding your family from the negative influences of this world.  My teenage son loved this movie so much, he insisted that we buy the DVD as soon as it came out, and we did.  Courageous will make you laugh, cry, hold your breath at times, but mostly it will make you rethink how you spend your time, what your real priorities are, and how your family interacts with one another.  It is a wonderful Christian movie, but it really is for everyone.  It doesn't beat you over the head or preach to you...it inspires you!
B004YXE438|5.0|This is a wonderful app. One of the best ways to kill 15 minutes that I can think of.  Wish it came with more puzzles though.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|I truly do love all things Jane Austen. And that includes Emma.  However, I reviewed this book as a 4 star simply because it lacks the strong story that other books from Ms. Austen display.<br /><br />Emma is a bit scheming and conniving and the story actually is more about events that just happen because of her medling ways. When I reviewed Pride and Prejudice I wrote how I loved the language - and this is no different. The word structure is exquisite. If it wasn't for the fact that I find Emma sometimes a bit too nosey I would love this book.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|Adele has an astonishingly good voice, I was hoping that buying this CD would show that but I was left a little disappointed. The vocals are good, but lack dynamics throughout most of the songs (it's very obvious in Rolling In The Deep). While that type of thing doesn't annoy me with a-lot of mainstream music, it does with hers because of her voice. She needs dynamics and nuance which none of these songs really have...the one exception being Someone Like You which is also my favorite song from the album. The studio engineers crushed most of the dynamics just to make the album sound like today's music which is a huge disappointment for such a great singer.
031618201X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this manga.  I'd loved the first book anyway and shared it with so many people that I do not even have my copy anymore but that's fine I have the magna and I so enjoy it.  Every description of the clothing everyone wore in the book was so good I got to enjoy the fashions on the page and fall in love with this series all over again.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|Some easy levels but many take some effort to figure out. Overall, a nice simple game that occupies a lot of time before you realize it.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is about a girl trying to escape her past when she goes to college, and attempts to become \\"Cashmered, no-nonsense Abby Abernathy.\\" Nearly as soon as she gets there, however, she meets Travis Maddox. Travis participates in underground fights at the university, sleeps with every pretty woman he can, enjoys a good party, and drives a Harley. Seems simple enough, Travis is exactly the kind of person Abby should avoid. The problem is, Travis won't leave her alone. Abby quickly discovers there is more to Travis than what meets the eye.<br /><br />The title could not be any more perfect. I am absolutely in love with this book. It's definitely not the most intellectual, literary novel out there, but it has a certain realistic quality that makes this book stand out. Beware: This story is addictive! While I was reading it, I didn't want to put it down to do every day things that I needed to get done. I was extremely tempted to ask my husband to make dinner! I lost sleep for this book and, as soon as I finished it, I started over at the beginning.<br /><br />This is not your typical contemporary romance. For one thing, Abby is not obsessed with Travis' looks. I have read so many romance novels that go on and on about jaw lines, broad shoulders, muscular abs, eye color, hair, etc., etc. It is so refreshing to read a book where the character's actually have conversations and aren't too busy ogling each other to pay attention!<br /><br />It may be clich&eacute;, but I truly feel like I know these characters. Even though we don't get very much history on the secondary characters, the author paints them in a way that the reader knows their personality. The story contains violence, gambling, and fairly descriptive sex, so I don't suggest reading it if these things bother you. This story is NOT a road map for successful, healthy relationships, but it's good fiction. I say Beautiful Disaster is realistic, and it is to a certain extent - the dialogue, the college parties, etc. - it is also so very impossible at the same time. Obviously, there are aspects of Abby's and Travis' lives that are completely unrealistic; I immensely enjoyed reading it, though.<br /><br />Fantastic work Ms. McGuire!etc. - it is also so very impossible at the same time. Obviously, there are aspects of Abby's and Travis' lives that are completely unrealistic; I immensely enjoyed reading it, though.<br /><br />Fantastic work Ms. McGuire!

B005M2A4D4|2.0|I am a long time Whovian and I can tell you that this is NOT \\"Doctor Who\\". This is \\"Doctor Who\\" trying to be the re-imagined \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" and \\"The X-Files\\". Most of the season has nothing but soap opera drama in it. Remember when \\"Doctor Who\\" was adventurous and action-packed. It's not ment be a soap. Way too much drama, and way too many subplots that seem to go on in the series forever.<br /><br />First you have \\"A Christmas Carol\\" which made an okay christmas episode, but overall it wasn't that great. I would have rather watched Charles Dickens' original version. Then you have the two-part season premiere \\"The Impossible Astronaut\\" and \\"Day of the Moon\\". That one had some great and very scary villains in it, but again the episodes have way too much drama in them and way too many subplots that aren't answered because they want you to keep watching the show. Hey BBC, if you want people to watch the show, why don't you just make it good? Then you won't need too many unanswered subplots. Then there's \\"The Curse of the Black Spot\\", which starts out great, but then disappoints in the second half. There's \\"The Doctor's Wife\\", another crappy episode. Then you have the two-part \\"The Rebel Flesh\\" and \\"The Almost People\\", which is a complete bore from beginning to end. Then the mid-season finale \\"A Good Man Goes to War\\", which is the only good episode so far this season. It is also the episode that reveals who River Song really is.<br /><br />Now for the second half of the season. There's \\"Let's Kill Hitler\\", which surprisingly was a pretty good episode. It features River's first meeting with the Doctor plus it has a good story, a lot of humorous moments, and some really good and exciting parts. Next you have \\"Night Terrors\\", which is another one of those episodes that starts out great, but then disappoints in the end. Then there's \\"The Girl Who Waited\\", which in my opinion is the worst episode in this season yet! Next is \\"The God Complex\\", which features a really scary creature in it, but the story is so idiotic and has so much drama in it, it's hard to like. Then there's \\"Closing Time\\", which wasn't to bad. It wasn't a great episode, but it wasn't a bad one either. It's a good one to watch once. It features the return of Craig from Season Five's \\"The Lodger\\", the Cybermen, and the Cybermats who haven't appeared since the 1975 Tom Baker story \\"Revenge of the Cybermen\\". It has lots of humorous moments in it as well as some suspenseful ones every now and then. Last, but not least you have the epic season finale \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", which surprisingly was a pretty damn good episode. Unfortunately you have to watch a lot of the dumb episodes this season in order to know what's going on in this one, but if you already have watched them, then this one will be a real treat. I'm not going to say too much about this episode other than it has a great story in it, the Silence returns in it, and it's action-packed.<br /><br />This season did have its moments and its good episodes, but they were few and far between. Most of this season felt like a soap opera which I do not like, and overall, disappointing. I think this was the worst season of \\"Doctor Who\\" yet. If I were you I'd stick with Season Five. That one may not have been a great season, but at least for the most part, it was still a good season. More than I can say for this one.<br /><br />Not recommended!scary creature in it, but the story is so idiotic and has so much drama in it, it's hard to like. Then there's \\"Closing Time\\", which wasn't to bad. It wasn't a great episode, but it wasn't a bad one either. It's a good one to watch once.

Last, but not least you have the epic season finale \\"The Wedding of River Song\\", which surprisingly was a pretty damn good episode. Unfortunately you have to watch a lot of the dumb episodes this season in order to know what's going on in this one, but if you already have watched them, then this one will be a real treat. I'm not going to say too much about this episode other than it has a great story in it, the Silence returns in it, and it's action-packed.<br /><br />This season did have its moments and its good episodes, but they were few and far between. Most of this season felt like a soap opera which I do not like, and overall, disappointing. I think this was the worst season of \\"Doctor Who\\" yet. If I were you I'd stick with Season Five. That one may not have been a great season, but at least for the most part, it was still a good season. More than I can say for this one.<br /><br />Not recommended!
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love absolutely LOVE it because it's NOT i Tunes. I hate having to buy music threw a company that will only let me listen to it on their devices (without jumping threw hoops to download it).<br /><br />Amazon accepts most of my current library & let's me purchase music at the same or better rate as competitors. Another of my favorite features is the fact that the upload & download system is a smooth & seamless process (oh the frustration i tunes have caused me over the years).<br /><br />Another great feature is the format- MP3's, rather than one format that can only be used in that company's devices. Being such a universal format it's much easier to use in all kinds of devices.<br /><br />Having everything on the cloud is great too. I don't have to use up my devices' memory & I get the same [music] on all my devices with only doing the work of adding to one. That also means no more, \\"which device is that song on?\\"!<br /><br />I LOVE IT!

B000063Y8F|4.0|I purchased my Rosle garlic press at The Chopping Block for about $50.  So, Amazon has a better price for this item.  We had purchased many competitors, including the Kuhn Rikon to test against each other.  I purchased the Rosle for myself after we used it at the cooking school  Of the ones we tested, The Rosle and the Kuhn Rikon were two of the top traditional presses.  However, I liked the Rosle better for the look.  The Kuhn Rikon looks cheaper to me. The traditional presses are all hard to clean but the polished surfaces of the Rosle made it a little easier to clean - especially with the rotating screen that makes it fast to pull out the peel.  My favorite of this type of device is still the Garlic Twist but this device is not a traditional press.  Please see my review of the Twist before buying a press.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Looks great<br />No peeling<br />Good size of garlic coming out<br /><br />Cons:<br />Garlic squishes out every crevice<br />Garlic and peel start to stick to device after a few cloves<br />Can only handle 1 clove (or two small cloves) at a time<br />Is hard to press when loaded up with very large cloves
0811875040|1.0|I gave this to my 16 year old daughter for Christmas.  She bakes all the time and was so excited to try the recipes<br />as the book is SO beautiful.<br /><br />She has spents HOURS baking from this cookbook and NOTHING has come out well.  The icing for cupcakes tasted like<br />air.  The cupcakes were dense and dry.  She has suffered and suffered over trying to get these beautiful results.  She takes treats<br />to school and I was embarrased for her to take the goodies made from this book.  No one said one word to her after trying these baked<br />goods which is a real tell all. I have<br />FINALLY convinced her some books are just for looking and others are truly user friendly.  This is NOT for baking!

0896898288|3.0|I was really really excited about making this quilt.  Then I realized I had to use templates.  I decided to give it a go anyway because I really want to do this quilt. I hate the templates.  I don't like using them at all. I don't understand what is so hard about saying \\"cut a 2\\" x 2\\" square\\" My advice to the author is this:  Next time include measurements for those of us who despise templates, it would be really nice.  I still plan on doing the quilt because I love the patterns. However, I'm going to have to sit down and measure all the templates and then go ahead and cut them the way I know how. Good Luck if you don't like templates!

B006P0FIGU|5.0|It always amazes me that Hollywood never gets tired of doing remakes of some of their films, always trying to get it right. In fact, I was recently reading about the obsession of trying to make the best \\"Great Gatsby\\" version of them all, with new one of them coming out soon.  All these feelings came to mind when watching the newest remake of \\"The Three Musketeers.\\" And let me tell you that I quite enjoyed this movie. It is what we go to the theaters for: it is exciting and fun and I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, as the production is majestic and quite colorful.<br /><br />The story is simple, but you can tell that a lot of thinking and planning went into designing it for the screen. The opening is fascinating, as a voice, using a map with miniatures, tells us that \\"It is the dawn of the 17th Century and after the assassination of his father, the young king Louis XIII ascends to the throne.\\" We are also told that the king (Freddie Fox) is surrounded by enemies, including his advisor, feared Cardinal Richelieu (Christoph Waltz), who is developing a plot to overthrow him. Enter Athos (Matthew Macfadyen), who makes an amazing entrance like a ninja; Aramis (Luke Evans), who does the same as sort of Batman; and Porthos (Ray Stevenson), who will remind you of the Joker. And this I say in a good way, as their appearances immediately tell you that this is great casting and that we are in for some fun. We also meet Milady De Winter (Milla Jovovich), a sexy, talented partner, who we will sadly discover is also a double-agent. The four of them team up to steal a blue-print of a DaVinci invention from the DaVinci vault in Venice. They succeed, but Milady fools the musketeers, and we learn that she was working for the Duke of Buckingham (Orlando Bloom). Enter, then,<br />D'Artagnan (Logan Lerman), who we meet while saying farewell to his parents, because he is leaving for Paris to become a musketeer. As fate has it, he does meet the musketeers, who at this time are down on their luck and fame, or, as Athos says, \\"obsolete.\\" However, a valuable necklace with diamonds is stolen from the queen, and D'Artagnan convince the musketeers to get their act together and get the necklace back, And that is when the adventure begins.<br /><br />It is understandable that some people do not feel right about how the classics are taken to the screen in a certain way, especially if the ambiance or the story doesn't reflect the environment of a given historical period. But modernization brought special effects and other things that make the studios compete to see who outdo each other. And that is what we get with this new, dynamic version of the Dumas' novel. I truly had a great time watching the action sequences and the great production design, which generates a great mix of history, due to its scenarios, and remarkable cinematic techniques. The way the movie ends, opens the possibility of a sequel, which is uncertain, given that the film sadly did not fare well at the box office. However, I hope that they find a way to do it. The DVD includes audio commentaries by cast and crew, making-of documentaries, deleted and extended scenes, and more.

B001NLKT60|4.0|I really enjoyed these series of books.  The first book in the series The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was a little hard to get in to but after the first couple chapters it took off and I couldn't wait to read the other two books and they delivered and would recommend the series.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|first of all i was dying to reach the end when i finally reached it. It was not awesome it was ok like if the author made a 4th book. But i also think there should be more romance with peeta and katniss at the end because i want to see wat happens to them. Then i think suzane collins should make a 4th book. there is only a week left till the movie comes that im dying to see all my freinds are getting together to watch this i know that this movie will be a big  hit. i just think over all suzanne should have ended the book better and if anyone asks im on team Peeta. Some rate this book a 2 but that is not possible  this book made me cry smile and even laugh i was not able to put this book down and i finished it in 2 days. hope everyone likes my review and Let The Games Begin thnx and bye
0199233381|4.0|First posted on Amazon.co.uk on 12 December 2011<br /><br />I got this book a while ago. I read it, liked it, adn have turned to it again as a starting point (but not a reference) when wanting to know more about one of the cities that it mentions. This book is however somewhat hard to rate.<br /><br />I found the concept great and rather original: summarize the history of Greece (about twlve centuties of it) through the presentation and history of 11 cities (not all of which can be termed as \\"greek\\"). However, the execution was rather problematic and the author, having been limited to less than 200 pages, was always going to face a major problem when dealing with so much content in so little space.<br /><br />To some, this book might seem to be too little and sometimes superficial because a whole book (or several, bearing in mind what Cartledge himself has done for Sparta) could probably have been written for each city. For others, this might be too much, not because of the size, but because the author mixes up a high level summary with quite a lot of details and some explanations that you might not expect to find in such a small book. This problem has, to some extent, already been alluded to by another reviewer when mentioning that the target audience seemed to be undefined. I am not quite sure about that because the book, given its size, clearly does not attempt to be comprehensive and, because it is very accessible, well written, easy to read and portable, clearly seems to have been targeted at the general reader.<br /><br />If I am correct in my assumption, then it is worth four stars. I am, however, among the ones who would have wanted to learn more (much more!) on each of the cities and their specifics so I hesitated and almost rated it three stars. Having said that, the book does include a lot of useful information, despite it small size, such as explaining how Sparta could afford to (and had to, to a large extent) transform itself into a militaristic state permanently geared for war and how this was both its main strength and its main weakness.<br /><br />A very interesting and easy read which I have been going through, once again, when going to work and during my luchtime. I hope that you will also enjoy it, despite its problems...ermanently geared for war and how this was both its main strength and its main weakness.<br /><br />A very interesting and easy read which I have been going through, once again, when going to work and during my luchtime.

B0059XTUEK|5.0|Marilyn Monroe will live forever, probably until the end of time. I don't know if it was her acting talents or lack of, her beauty, her portrayed innocence, her sexuality or many other qualities, but the thing is, we can't have enough of her. A lot has been written about her and her sad and misunderstood life, and the exquisite \\"My week with Marilyn\\" gives us a charming and honest look at Marilyn's character in some detail<br /><br />Perhaps the best way to describe what this film is all about is by quoting the paragraph that opens it: \\"In 1956 Marilyn Monroe went to England to make a film with Laurence Olivier. She met Colin Clark, who wrote a diary about the making of the film.\\" Colin Clark was a well-to-do young man who wanted to make it in show business, and for that purpose he went to Laurence Olivier's (Kenneth Branagh) production office on a daily basis, in order that he could be hired. His insistence paid off and Olivier hired him as third assistant director on the film \\"The Sleeping Prince.\\" His position basically was that of an errand way, which he accepted and worked very hard at it. The star of the film, in addition to Olivier - who  also directed --, was Marilyn Monroe (Michelle Williams), who arrived to England with her then husband, writer Arthur Miller.<br /><br />During the filming of the movie, Monroe was problematic, and it was driving Olivier insane, with, her coming late to the set, her insecurities, her constant auto medication, her troubles with her husband, and the presence of her controlling acting coach. Olivier was at one point advised to \\"try to accept her in her own terms to avoid problems. Trying to change her would drive him crazy.\\" To the rescue came Colin, who, for some reason Marilyn got attached to, and became her confidant. This relationship would affect the completion of the film, and would change Colin's life forever.<br /><br />\\"My week with Marilyn\\" is kind of a coming of age film - at least for Colin --, but it also gives usan intimate look at Marilyn's persona, and how tormented she was. And, despite all this, she had the gift of stealing people's hearts, as well as a special kind of charisma on the screen. Judy Dench, who plays actress Sybil Thorndike, said it best, when she told Colin that \\"first love is such sweet despair.\\" The film, which was later called \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" was done before the successful \\"Some like it hot.\\"  Needless to say, Michelle Williams was nominated for an Oscar for her amazing portrayal of Marilyn Monroe, and Kenneth Branagh was nominated for his portrayal of Laurence Olivier. The Blu-ray edition includes the DVD format of the film, commentary by director Simon Curtis, and a making-of documentary.(UK/USA, 2011, color, 99 min plus additional materials).<br /><br />Reviewed on March 13, 2012 by Eric Gonzalez for The Weinstein Company / Anchor Bay Entertainment
B00003CXDD|5.0|First when I saw the cover for the movie, I thought it looked silly, even childish, for kids. But in the end I was like: ''ah, what the hell, let's see it''. So I am not disappointed in my final choice. Willow is a great addition to classic, fantasy movies. It's not short, and it's exactly what new movies are not. It has the great story, it's not short, in fact 2 hours of pure enjoyment, likable characters and it's just touching. The monsters, trolls are of course not made with the latest technologies, but in fact I liked it. They look great for movies of their time. So do I like the movie? I love it. It's exactly what a great movie should be like. Do yourself a favor and ask yourself if you are willing to give this movie a chance. You won't be disappointed.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Good quality minus JarJar who is still annoying. Other wise this really updates the movie. Only downfall is that it is single case with all three movies in one package gets annoying.
B001NEK2GE|3.0|The latest software for this keypad is from 2010 and there are no new versions available to fix the main issue under OS X about the LCD Manager app consuming from 50% to 80% of CPU even when the keypad is not in use.<br /><br />The product is great, but that software issue is a killer, even more when you are in a game and you need all CPU power for the game, not for the keyboard. How come a keyboard application can kill the resources of a computer!<br /><br />If Logitech do not release an update soon, I will be looking at the Razer Nostromo Gaming Keypad (RZ07-00490100-R3) to replace this one, I know the Nostromo is not as comfortable as the Logitech, but it has full support for OS X and constant updates of the drivers/firmware, which is the downside of Logitech.<br /><br />Logitech, please fix this!!!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I'm not sure why this book is so controversial. I think people are just quick to defend their own parenting methods, which is fine (to each his own). After reading this book, I didn't get the feeling that the author was criticizing anyone, she was simply telling her own story and observations. There is a cultural difference and it is always worth reading how other people do things. It doesn't make one way better than another way. No one talks about the end results of either parenting method. Chances are French babies grow up needing just as much therapy as American babies.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to all parents. It is not a parenting (how-to) book, but a book about parenting. It is well researched and full of information, but the author never claims she is an expert. Rather, she explains that she is finding parenting to be an ever-evolving situation where no \\"tricks\\" will apply to all situations. That, I have learned, is very true.<br /><br />Read it before you jump to conclusions. It is a good cultural study, if nothing else.
B005VTS4EY|4.0|this app was fun and progressively more challenging as you continue. there was plenty of variety in the puzzle types, as well.
1612130283|5.0|I LOVED this book.  It captivated me from beginning to end!  Although, the ending leaves you wanting more.  I'm glad I read this after book #2 was already released.
B0068TL23G|5.0|Fun game. Makes you use your brain. Works great on my T-Mobile Sensation. It would be worth buying this game.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|such a page turner! loved every bit of it! another great book by Mr. Nicholas Sparks! can't wait to read all of his other books!!
B007H7XJD4|5.0|I dont know why this film is given so many bad reviews.<br />Shouldn't be trusted. It was an awesome flick that had me riveted from<br />beginning to end. I wish I had paid the babysitter and seen it on the<br />Big Screen. Definitely worth the 4 bucks!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Hooked, line and sinker. My husband is getting jealous and I now get little sleep all because of my new addiction from MobilityWare. Incredibly challenging and very rewarding when you can beat the computer!  There are various levels, very few ads (which is awesome) and each game is different in as far as strategy is concerned. The more you play, the better you become. I would even recommend children as young as 10 can begin at level one. Older folks will be more than mildly surprised. Highly recommend if you enjoy solitaire because this game has a bit of a twist.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good variety of games.  Graphics are colorful and well rendered.  On my Kindle Fire the responses of movement such as flicking the darts are sometimes slow. With the UI one learns to compensate.
B004047XXO|2.0|I am a fan of Ice Age movies but this was just the worst quality 3D movie I have ever seen!  I would not recommend at all.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|this is a real help. I take on line classes and have to look up different translations of the Bible.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book brought out how terrible war can be.  We who have never been there have no idea.  It is amazing that even the young child can be your demise because of a bomb they have.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I completely recommend reading this book as well as the whole trilogy! You cannot put the books down. Very exciting reads.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun and interesting how you have to complete games and reach a goal to get points and unlock other games. not like many apps out there and definetly worth the time to download. and its free!
B000JMKO0A|1.0|That is all.<br /><br />How does this book sell like it does? It is terribly written, no plot, co character development, not even a clear setting.<br /><br />I hate Maria. She is far from being a likeable character.<br /><br />OMG I dont have words to describe how awful this book was!!<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! Borrow it from someone.
B001TODO54|4.0|So I really really enjoyed this book--in fact that's why I'm rating it a little more harshly than I do with most stuff. Simply because it was so good-it had the potential to be \\"knock your socks off\\" amazing--but wasn't. I thought the idea of the graces was interesting and well done, that the sick brutality of the king was done with just the right amount of detail to make you feel it but not enough to make you have nightmares, and that Katsya was a really cool main character.<br /><br />My issue was with the style of writing. For some reason I found it very difficult to immerse myself into the world as the book read like a very interesting story but not a wardrobe to Narnia that you can experience for yourself. It was just a little too formal and removed for my taste. However, the book really is great and I imagine any fan of the Hunger Games Series would love it as well.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Great movie that is especially geared towards young girls.  I have 3 kiddies, now aged 8,9 and 5.  My two oldest ladies enjoyed the movie immensely whereas our youngest gentlemen walked away because it was 'too girly' (that's what he said!).  They watched it on the Blu-ray disc and caught it recently again on television.  If they sat through commercials then this tells me that this would be a worthwhile purchase for any parent.<br /><br />I enjoy buying the loaded combo but truly have not looked through all the extras.  The blu-ray quality is impeccable as is the DVD but that has been delegated as a 'car' DVD.<br /><br />Highly recommend this combo and even the regular DVD version to save a bit of money.  We enjoyed watching it with the girls.  I have always loved everything fairies and it was very enjoyable learning about the rest of the fairies.  They weren't just side-kicks in the film.
0439023521|1.0|Just another \\"edgy\\" teen novel. Derivative at best. It's premise of children being forced to kill each other was executed far better in Koushun Takami's Battle Royale. It's futuristic setting seems ripped from Scott Westerfeld's Uglies trilogy. Both of these works are vastly superior to anything Suzanne Collins has had to offer so far.
B005K17RU0|5.0|On the leading edge of forecasting from network TV days, heavy duty clients count on these guys. I do too.
B0000025IE|5.0|Ok, here's the deal with \\"British Steel.\\" When I bought it, I liked Priest but they were nowhere near close to my favorite group of all time (which they have been for some time now). I bought this very CD, the 1990 original pressing, so I heard it the way it is meant to sound (i.e., not the remastered version). But the album tracks really failed to grab me then. After a few forced listens (i.e., trying to like it) I gave up on this album and sold the disc.<br /><br />Some time later I couldn't walk away from a good deal on \\"Painkiller\\" which I then loved in its entirety as an album. Priest was back in my life. \\"Vengeance\\" was soon acquired, and then that pretty much opened the floodgates. Over a year later I reacquired \\"British Steel\\" (the original again - which is the item that this review is posted under), since by then I had the rest of the group's classic catalog, so I needed it for completeness' sake.<br /><br />And I discovered with amazement, on the first listen of my second ownership of it, that \\"British Steel\\" is, in fact, one of the group's best albums.<br /><br />Standard listening equipment: car audio - JVC KD-S680 mated to a 1990 fully restored JBL sound system (3-way + 2-way speakers, amp), the entire system original (Lincoln Mark VII) except for the head unit; home audio - Yamaha RX-V1300 AV receiver, Acoustic Research 3-way speakers (circa 1990 as well, also restored to the original condition).<br /><br />.......It may well be that I now appreciate \\"British Steel\\" (1980) more because in the context of Priest's catalog it forms a sort of a vantage point. On the one hand, knowing \\"Stained Class\\" and \\"Hell Bent\\" (both 1978 albums, \\"Hell Bent\\" released stateside in 1979) you can clearly see the ways in which those two predecessors shaped it and how \\"British Steel\\" really merges the best features from both albums into a new sound. Thus \\"Living After Midnight\\" continues in the hard rock tradition of the \\"Hell Bent\\" album and \\"United\\" is another stadium chant in the vein of \\"Take On The World.\\" But the remainder of \\"British Steel\\" is pure heavy metal! And that's where this album sounds more like \\"Stained Class\\" than \\"Hell Bent,\\" only that sound has now widened and become immediate (some have described it as a sellout; not this reviewer).<br /><br />On the other hand, it was only after having listened to the albums that followed that I appreciated \\"You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise\\" - in fact it became my favorite song on \\"British Steel.\\" This (foolishly dismissed as childish by allmusic) was the first of those trademark \\"I'll live my life my way\\" Priest songs, followed later by such classics as \\"Heading Out To The Highway,\\" \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin'\\" (do people even listen to the words ever???), \\"Rock Hard Ride Free\\"... you get the point. Sure, the subject matter was more than hinted at in \\"Running Wild\\" but \\"You Don't Have To Be Old\\" does not just state the objective, it presents a lengthy diatribe directed against \\"being programmed\\" and having \\"ties\\" in life. This, lyrically more immediate, song then illuminates the meaning of \\"Grinder\\" behind whose legendary riff hides a message along much the same lines - Rob's \\"inclined to wander off the beaten track,\\" holds \\"a license for self-reliance on this earth\\" and has \\"no use for routine\\" (represented by the Grinder). Whoa - this is hardly some childish rebellion babble! I would call it a fairly well-stated philosophy (especially coming from a bunch of guys who lived what they preached). And then you listen to \\"Living After Midnight\\" in light of that message and the whole thing kind of falls into place all of a sudden, doesn't it.<br /><br />\\"British Steel\\", then, is a remarkably cohesive album. Priest's message is on display for the first time with relentless focus and consistency, spanning the full range of ruminations both profound and silly. But all of that would surely fall on deaf ears had the music been anything short of brilliant. Luckily - brilliant is the word - the timeless classics here range from the elegantly menacing \\"Grinder\\" to the anthemic stompers \\"Living After Midnight\\" and \\"United\\", to finally the driving, empowering, uplifting freedom and self-reliance anthems \\"You Don't Have To Be Old\\" and the epic closer \\"Steeler\\". Oh, yeah, and then there's that \\"Breaking The Law\\" song. \\"Rapid Fire,\\" \\"Metal Gods\\" and \\"The Rage\\" are all excellent compositions as well. There is not a wasted second here.<br /><br />Folks, this is one of the greatest albums of all time. That being said, please do your ears a favor and get the original CD while you still can, those are the best and sound amazing. Discover and enjoy!
B006964E8S|3.0|I have read every one of David Baldacci's previous works and find his new character (Puller) not as interesting as his previous heroes and heroines. Okay, I am only one third of the way into the book so there's some way to go and time for Baldacci to have fleshed out the main character and the storyline.<br />So for me, it's a 3 out of 5 so far where I would have given nearly all his previous works a 4 or 5 out of 5.
B005G26NJE|5.0|Gary Clarke Jr has the chops to go a long way in his career.  His new \\"The Bright Lights\\" EP is an excellent start to showcase his blues guitar talent.  It's a good mix of instrumental guitar and power trio blues.  His music appeals to young and old alike. I loved it!  I missed his recent Baltimore-area, but will make sure I catch him live the next time he comes through town.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I purchased this item and returned it for the individual books because the combined edition does not have the individual book cover art and chapter navigation controls.<br /><br />The content of the stories themselves is fantastic of course.....but I do not recommend this electronic edition.
B005GK6QAM|5.0|\\"Emotional Fire\\" is the third, brand new studio album by melodic rock/AOR project \\"Sunstorm\\". \\"Sunstorm\\" is AOR legend Joe Lynn Turner backed by members of the German hard rock band \\"Pink Cream 69\\"- bassist Denis Ward, guitarist Uwe Reitenauer and drummer Chris Schmidt- plus keyboardist Justin Dakey.<br /><br />\\"Emotional Fire\\" is substantially differentiated in comparison to its predecessor. While \\"House of Dreams\\" was a fairly subtle and somewhat melancholic AOR album, the new \\"Sunstorm\\" is in-your-face fiery melodic rock that wastes no time given that the average song makes its point in just over three minutes.<br /><br />It has to be addressed that \\"Emotional Fire\\" is a combination of classic compositions (the majority of which served as Michael Bolton tunes) and contemporary melodic rock songwriting contributed by such artists as Daniel Palmkvist, Tom Martin, Robert Sall and Issa. Clearly the classic material scores somewhat higher that its modern counterpart, yet, that is not to say that \\"Emotional Fire\\" is an uneven album. On the contrary, Turner's phenomenal performance unifies the track list completely in one solid \\"Sunstorm\\" album. The vocal attack that comes out of the man is hard to believe, bringing similar levels of intensity as he did in during his \\"Rainbow\\" days.<br /><br />\\"Emotional Fire\\", \\"You wouldn't know love\\", \\"Torn in half\\", \\"Gina\\" and \\"Never Give Up\\" are definite to win over even the most demanding of AOR admirers. It does not get much better than this, indeed.
B006ZT47O0|1.0|Well, let me start off by saying Epica was my favorite band until this CD came out.  This is not the usual great Epica we all know and love.  This CD is really bad!!  For some reason, Simone's voice doesn't go well on this CD.  There isn't that many heavy songs on this either.  I am very disappointed by this CD.  If you want to hear Epica at their best, buy the CD's \\"The Divine conspiracy and Design Your Universe\\".  Stay away from this one.  Oh well, time to find a new favorite band.  Epica has let me down with this CD.
140120841X|4.0|It's always hard to review something as highly regarded as \\"V for Vendetta\\", or anything by Alan Moore really. His works are almost universally applauded, and their reputations are almost bigger than the stories they tell. And rightfully so; these aren't comics, these are full blown novels that just so happen to be accompanied by intricate artwork.<br /><br />I've been working my way through his works over the last few years, starting with \\"Watchmen\\", then \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\", then \\"The Killing Joke\\" and now I've finally made it to \\"V for Vendetta\\" (and I've started \\"Saga of the Swamp Thing\\").<br /><br />I actually saw the movie a few years ago and really enjoyed it, but I still wanted to read the graphic novel. Now that I've read the novel I want to go back and watch the movie again so I can compare them in my head. A few key differences stand out (from what I remember) but overall I would say the tone of the two felt the same, which I think is a credit to the screenwriter and the director.<br /><br />So on to my review of the graphic novel. It's a dark story, in a dark future, told with dark and muted artwork. Most of the time the art works fairly well, but sometimes I had trouble discerning what was happening in certain panels (although, from reading other reviews, it sounds like this may just be an issue with the paperback). The artwork isn't black and white, it's very muted watercolor I think, but it may as well be black and white. And aside from V himself, a lot of the characters are very hard to identify from one panel to the next. Even the other main character, Evey, can be hard to identify as her look changes drastically throughout the book. Although, in regard to distinguishing characters one from the other, maybe this is done on purpose as the fascist government seems to look down on individualism. But I don't think that's really it, I think it just lacked needed detail, so the artwork (at least in the paperback edition) gets a 3 out of 5 from me.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story, although I do feel the pacing was a little uneven. Sometimes it was a real page turner and I was just fascinated by the writing, and then the pacing or the focus would change and I would lose interest and go to bed for the night to pick it up again later when it wasn't in such danger of putting me to sleep. But, overall, the story was great and I was interested to know what would happen next and how events would unfold, even though I'd seen the movie and had a pretty good idea already. I do think the cast of secondary characters may be a little too broad. It gets really hard to keep track of who is who between the government entities of the finger, the nose, the eye, etc. The previously mentioned lack of detail in the artwork doesn't help. I can't blame the folks behind the movie for whittling the cast of characters down a little.<br /><br />I think some of the things I find most interesting about the story is some of what isn't expressly written on the page. Part of V's motivation is an actual vendetta, which starts the ball rolling, but part of it is something else, and he apparently chose Evey to accomplish that something else because, in a sense, V is a madman, but he'a a madman who's smart enough to know his role and to know his place. The ending between him and Finch is interesting as well, although it's left out of the movie, and Finch only makes a passing comment about it at the end of the book. But to me at least it imparts a bit of a sense of morality and justice to V, who for the most part is an amoral character who's just as violent as the government he opposes. Sometimes I enjoy subtlety in a story, not having every detail spelled out, and here these particular aspects of the story work well.<br /><br />I give the story 5 out of 5. Average the two together and you get my rating of 4 stars. If you haven't read the novel and you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend both.f 5 from me.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story, although I do feel the pacing was a little uneven.

0385535139|4.0|The Litigators is, in my opinion, one of Grisham's better books in recent years. Is it great literature? If you've read any of Grisham's books, you know the answer to that question is definitely not. However, The Litigators is a highly entertaining, often humorous, at times suspenseful book that is filled with interesting characters involved in situations that makes you want to keep turning the pages to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Without going into a lot of detail, The Litigators involves the law firm of Finley & Finn, a seedy operation that for the past twenty years or so has  specialized in quickie divorces, DUIs and, of course, auto accidents; and is constantly on the lookout for the case that will change their lives. This change starts to come about when a young, Harvard-educated lawyer burned out from his high-paying job at a major law firm stumbles -- literally stumbles -- into the firm of Finley & Figg.<br /><br />I won't say more about the plot, which can be learned about from the Book Description page above. I just want to leave you with the opinion that The Litigators is filled with the kind of interesting characters, courtroom strategies, theatrics, humor and surprises readers have come to expect from  Grisham when he is at the top of his game.

0307454568|5.0|Despite the reviews of the naysayers, the final entry in the Millenium trilogy was quite a page-turner for me. I read through the last 350 pages in just a few hours, and it will both shock you and put a smile on your face. The ending, without spoiling, is perfect, and ties up the trilogy quite nicely.

The delivery was fast & curtious & the product was in perfect condition. What more could I ask for from a seller? Perfect!

B006X08EZY|5.0|Without any warning whatsoever a new album appears out of nowhere featuring a likely and unlikely pair playing live at Carnegie Hall from some eight years ago. We need more nice surprises. Though many would make the connection between David Byrne and Caetano Veloso from Byrne's interest and work with South American music styles, many may not see the opposite connection. The cool latin jazz style of some of Veloso's best known work provides quite a stark contrast to Byrne's relatively thumping pop/rock songs. Nonetheless, in the liner notes Veloso praises Byrne for expanding Brazilian music's range into new realms, and particularly thanks him for exposing Tom Ze to the world. Though somehow the whole disparate collection comes together not quite perfectly, but perfectly enough for a great ride.<br /><br />The set opens with an amazing set of six songs by Veloso. The crowd goes nuts after the first few bars of every song and Veloso nails each one with a finesse tantamount to his very deserved reputation. The backing musicians get introduced one by one throughout this first section. Then, almost shockingly, Veloso breaks into \\"The Revolution\\" from Byrne's \\"Look Into The Eyeball.\\" Half way through the crowd freaks out again and Byrne joins Veloso for the last part of the song. Then Byrne takes over, with a mostly familar set. \\"Life During Wartime\\" surprisingly works in a stripped down acoustic arrangement. \\"God's Child,\\" a song Byrne wrote and performed with the late Selena, stands out here as it does on his other recent released-way-too-late live recording from Austin City Limits.<br /><br />Both performers come together for the last section of the set. They duet on a song they co-wrote, \\"Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses\\" and interestingly on \\"(Nothing But) Flowers,\\" and \\"Heaven.\\" Byrne even sings in Portugese on the stunning \\"Um Canto de Afoxe para o Bloco de Ile,\\" returning the favor for Veloso's English vocals. The set closes with two amazing songs: Veloso's \\"Terra\\" and Byrne's (Talking Heads') \\"Heaven.\\" The backing instrumentation provides great texture throughout, including various percussion and cello. Overall, a great set that runs over an hour and ten minutes. Both Veloso and Byrne fans will fall over with joy.<br /><br />Those who have signed up for Byrne's e-mailing list will have heard of this release already. In that message he said that \\"Record business nonsense\\" kept this album under wraps for almost a decade. He also claimed that he was very nervous that night and that \\"flubs\\" occur \\"here and there.\\" Well, that's true, but none of them detract from the show as a whole. In the end, Veloso and Byrne come together and meld in ways many will not expect. The only complaint remains the incomprehensible time it took to finally release this great concert. May life throw more equally wonderful surprises our way.nd Byrne's (Talking Heads') \\"Heaven.\\" The backing instrumentation provides great texture throughout, including various percussion and cello.

B002Q9MZF6|5.0|An absolutely wonderful version. The minimalism of the set added to the performance as your whole focus was on the voices. Villazon and Netrebko make an incredible team.
0375507256|5.0|an incredibly imaginative, wholly absorbing book. like other reviewers will sure note, it is better for an unfamiliar reader to approach it as several separate books than one distinct whole, though this is not to say it's a collection of short stories. one of the funniest books I've read, Cloud Atlas is also, at times, a compelling mystery/thriller, a sci-fi dystopian story and an ode to classical music. just read it already.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This page-turner moves fast. It is absolutely satisfying, and I found it really difficult to find a stopping place so that I could attend to real life. I will re-read several more times, I am sure...and, I have strongly recommended it to so many friends already.
B006ZT47O0|1.0|When I first played this this afternoon the first thing that came to mind was \\"What the f*** was Mark Jansen thinking\\".  On almost every track, just as you are getting into Simone's vocal, Marc starts growling.  Usually, I just skip to the next track when this happens, but on this CD that noise is everywhere.  I understand that many metalheads are little boys that are just reaching puberty and they get excited by such vocal stupidity.  If that is the audience that Jansen really wants for Epica, then just keep on feeding the prepubescent boys.  Clearly, this album is not anywhere near the quality of Nightwish's Imaginaerium.  At least when Marco growls, he is in tune with something and he doesn't overpower Anette. Grow up Mark!

B000002VE7|5.0|STEREOTOMY is sort of the black sheep of the APP family.  It's a little harder-edged than previous efforts and not as \\"thematic\\" in concept.  Yet I thoroughly enjoy this album and appreciate the venture into non-familiar territory.<br />Vocals from John Miles, Gary Brooker, Chris Rainbow and Graham Dye are effective and there's a nice cameo vocal from Eric Woolson.  Guitarist Ian Bairnston supplies incredible lead work and the arrangements impeccably Parsons.<br />While the themes of loss and depression are prevalent, the songs themselves are mostly up-tempo and bright and the ballads are typical Parsonesque.<br />The title track is one of my favorites, its staccato delivery and enigmatic lyrics hypnotic.  BEAUJOLAIS is bouncy and infectious.  LIMELIGHT is lovely despite its mournful pathos.  URBANIA and WHERE's THE WALRUS are polished instrumentals, a little more intricate than earlier offerings.<br />All in all, I think STEREOTOMY is a fine album, a strong representation of APP's musical genius.
B007H51DQG|3.0|I was a huge fan of the Walking Dead during season 1. I even told all my friends and had them watching it.<br /><br />Then season 2 came.<br /><br />I don't think The Walking Dead will ever be a bad show, but its just not the same this season and I'm growing bored with it. As others have said its overly melodramatic and has turned into a soap opera which is making many lose interest over time. Certain decisions made in the show don't make sense and some characters are barely even seen anymore. I'm just not getting the same feeling from the show that had me rabidly waiting for the next episode last season. I have not read the comics that the show is based off of, but I truly hope the show is able to focus more on the apocalypse than the petty bickering that is getting old. I get the fact that the show is supposed to be dramatic, but when a show named The Walking Dead becomes only a drama people will go watch something else.
0439023521|4.0|I feel like I'm probably the last person in the world to read The Hunger Games. I have to admit that I just wasn't interested in it by seeing the cover. I know that's shallow, but to me it looked like a \\"man book\\". Not that the cover wasn't a good cover, there was just nothing feminine about it. I'm sure I don't even have to go over the premise with you all. If you haven't read it, then you've probably at least heard all about it. I've seen other book bloggers talk about this book for what seems like ages now, so my interest slowly raised. When I saw everything about the movie opening up this month, I decided that I ought to give it a try - and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />It was a wonderfully written book filled with lots of descriptions of the time period. I did, however, think that the book had a lot of slow parts - especially toward the beginning. That's the main reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of a 5. This dystopian book had a great premise, but I'm not exactly sure why the government was the way that it was. Maybe I will find out more about that in the other books.<br /><br />The characterization in this book is great. You get to start feeling attached to so many of the characters. Katniss is a courageous girl who makes an awesome heroine. There are two great guys who have the potential to be a love interest. I really came to like Peeta, but I'd really like to see Katniss with Gale. Though, to be honest, my moms' name is Gale so that does weird me out a little bit. Speaking of names, almost all the names in this book are unusual.<br /><br />This is not a fluffy, easy-reading type of book. These are very emotional times for these characters. The horrors they go through are unimaginable. It definitely makes you grateful for the things that you do have.
B005F96URI|2.0|Guy Moshe's \\"Bunraku\\" is a genre-bending amalgamation of Western movie and graphic novel (and a bit of bunraku, Japanese traditional puppet theater). The film's visuals are highly stylized with bright colors and dark shadows all over, but the film lacks story to tell and action to show. This is a typical case of \\"style over substance,\\" which in itself is not a bad thing, but with the running time that exceeds two hours, production design alone is not enough to keep us interested in the film's thin story.<br /><br />The concept is intriguing. In a post-apocalyptic dystopian city where no guns are allowed, Josh Hartnett's \\"Drifter\\" meets a samurai \\"Yoshi\\" played by Japanese pop culture icon Gackt at the saloon run by the Bartender (Woody Harrelson). After their initial confrontation, the two strangers learn that what they want is ultimately the same.<br /><br />However, \\"Bunraku\\" takes too much time before letting us know where it is going. There are so many fight scenes, but with choreography not so original, the film's action, which should have been one of the film's assets, soon starts to get repetitious and tiresome. Most characters are forgettable (Ron Perlman is wasted; Demi Moore's role is pointless) and acting passable at best. The only exception is \\"Killer No. 2\\" played by Kevin McKidd. He is not boring.<br /><br />Watching \\"Bunraku\\" is after all watching its designs. And like \\"Dick Tracy\\" made about 20 years ago, it shows that production design is something that is necessary but not sufficient for filmmaking.

0439023491|5.0|It's just after The Hunger Games, just after Katniss & Peeta defy the Capitol by threatening to kill themselves. Katniss discovers that her strategy to paint herself & Peeta as star-crossed lovers will be a charade she will forever have to play, will have to live out in order to survive. Meanwhile, Peeta discovers that Haymitch & Katniss have concocted this love affair and that Katniss doesn't love him to the full extent that he loves her. Though Peeta and Katniss agree to continue the charade in the public eye, for the safety of their families, their relationship is now strained. They embark on their victory tour as scheduled, visiting the districts and thanking them for their support, but something brews in the districts, something Katniss has sparked and cannot stop. To the dismay of the Capitol, the districts have started to organize uprisings, using Katniss as their inspiration. A Quarter Quell is upon the districts, a 75th annual Hunger Games, and that means a special games is to be held. When President Snow reads the slip of paper and it is announced that the tributes for the Quarter Quell will be selected from the existing victors, Katniss realizes that she is the only female victor from District 12. Katniss will be forced to return to the arena. But who will return with her? Will Peeta or Haymitch be chosen? And has President Snow rigged the Quarter Quell to get rid of Katniss once and for all?<br /><br />Another page-turner in The Hunger Games Trilogy, I read this book within 24 hours of starting it. I found myself riding the wave of emotions with Katniss, Peeta, and Haymitch, and biting my nails as I learned of their fates.

0062082353|5.0|Originally, I was just going to read the reviews here after finishing the book myself.  After going through many of the reviews, I thought I'd offer my 2 cents worth.<br /><br />I am what Kyle calls a \\"granola\\".  Never owned a gun, never been in the military,  I am a \\"Yankee\\" (as he calls it), and kind of a lefty.  I only mention this because I think that what you see in this book and how you like or don't like it will be influenced by many factors that are purely in the reader, not the author.<br /><br />I thought the book was a good read, light reading to be sure, but interesting.  It is not a manual about how to be a sniper, nor is it a log book describing the details of each kill in excruciating detail.  I personally just enjoyed Kyle's straightforward, unvarnished, highly opinionated description of his life with emphasis on his 4 tours.  I got some appreciation for how sniping fits into the big picture, at least in urban combat.  I think there is a lot to ponder in this book relating to the pros and cons of having a professional army rather than citizen-soldiers.  I think it gives a good insight into the psychology of tribes and close-knit groups.<br /><br />I also think the ghost writers did a good job.  Too many books these days feel like the author was paid by the word and the book was published by the Department of Redundancy Department.  I thought that in this book Kyle said what he had to say without padding it out.  I think the ghostwriters did their job of cleaning things up while still letting the essence of Kyle shine through.  There were only a few places where it was obvious that I was reading DeFelice, not Kyle.<br /><br />Finally, I'm happy that Kyle is cashing in. Although our opinions diverge on many topics (including, apparently, the desirability of continuing the American Civil War indefinitely), I owe Kyle and all his comrades a debt of gratitude.

Finally seeing the omnibus edition, and having it available to lend through Amazon Prime, I gave it a shot.<br /><br />I'm back now a day or two later to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this series as it rests now, and look forward to reading more.  More of this story and more from Mr. Howey.  I went ahead and bought the omnibus edition, and will purchase each additional title as they become available.<br /><br />Now, about the books...  I found them to be well written, well edited, and well paced.  It is apparent that Mr. Howey takes great pride in his work.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. Howey.  You've earned a new fan.
B006IYG5HE|3.0|This was a good book, and I can see why those who are interested in the book's subject matter are fans.<br />It is much more of a police book than what I expected--(duh, the main character is a cop). I think I was blinded by the Steig Larsen association which I do not understand.<br />On the Kindle, the book was a little difficult to follow at first because the chapters are separated by time (either WW2 or present-ish) and it's more difficult to go back and check which era since one can't flip a few pages.<br />The author's humor, however, is spot-on and well placed. I also recommended this book to those I know are more interested in the subject matter(s).

B001R4MEUM|5.0|I have never heard this album till now. Not many people even talk about the Gabriel day's of Genesis. I have allways liked his voice & his solo songs but i wanted to know about this album because i heard things like this is his best genesis album. So i listened to a few songs on youtube then went ahead and bought it. Now that i have it all i can say is that this album is Brilliant & Amazing! I wish i bought it years ago. And this remastered album sounds so great on a big powerful stereo system. If you know the Black Swan Movie you know the Drama & Amazing performance she pulled off in the movie. Well this is how i feel about Peter Gabriels performance on this album with the same ending. In the Movie her death at the end is Peter Gabriels last note & him exiting from the band. Just Brilliant! From the moment of the opening title track i'm more then halfway sucked in but when Fly on a Windshield starts & Peter say's \\" And I'm hovering like a fly, waiting for the windshield on the freeway \\" I'm in all the way through the move into Broadway Melody of 1974. You can say this is Peter Gabriels Swan Song All You Want! But For Me It's A Step Beyond & More Beautiful To Call It His BLACK SWAN!

0749942169|5.0|Won this book on Read It Forward; it's my first experience with the author and I found her style to be quite different than what I was used to, but I liked it a lot. It's not loaded with endless paragraphs of descriptive commentary or bloated dialogue - and yet at the same time, she managed to create realistic characters with depth and heart. It's told from the perspective of a mother's out-of-body soul/ghost/whatever, since her body is lying in a coma the entire book. The story involves a mystery, but is also about the love between a mother and child, between a husband and wife, and the lengths that someone will go for those they love. Nicely done. Recommended.

0060935464|2.0|The only reasons I gave this two stars is I like Atticus and Boo. The End. Otherwise this book was dull with mostly boring characters, the court scenes are the closest thing to entertainment in this book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just downloaded this apt and enjoy it very much! Would recommend to any one who likes playing this game with cards to try it.

0142000671|1.0|This book is dull, and I do not know why people like to read it and then to make it into a MOVIE and a PLAY. Boring writing, mild characters, slow almost motionless plot.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|Haven't had the opportunity to listen more than twice so I have no conclusion on where this album rates in the Bruce pantheon (other than it's certainly one of his better efforts in recent years). But I can say for the first time in a long time on a Bruce album that the production, engineering, mastering, etc. is very strong for a rock recording. Good riddance to Brendan O'Brien, Nick Didia, Tom Syrowski  and co. who were responsible for the sound of Working On A Dream and Magic (one of the worst sounding albums ever recorded by professionals).<br /> This album sounds really good. Kudos to Bruce and/or Jon Landau who perhaps listened to the complaints about the last few albums from fans who enjoy the sounds of music on a system that can generate better than mp3 resolution. Special thanks to Ron Aniello, Ross Peterson and  Bob Clearmountain.  I hope Bruce doesn't let this team get away.

0385344228|5.0|Wow!  Wasn't ready for the end...not really.  There were hints but I didn't want to believe it.  So I chose not to.  This isthe first William Landay novel I've read, but will read more.  He keeps you wanting more.  when I finished the novel, I still wanted more.  I kept forgetting this was not a true crime drama.  It all seemed so real.  The reader will not want to put the book down, so bfore you start, make sure you have time to read till the end.
0316098329|4.0|*spoilers*<br /><br />I liked room. I loved that Ma chose to create a world for Jack in Room. I think it was an excellent survival technique. There is no reason a child should have to bare the fear and burden of knowing his world was a trap. I love that she kept him educated and as active as possible in their little space.<br /><br />I did not like the people when they got out of Room. The grandma, aunt, and uncle to be more specific. The kid has never interacted with anyone but his mom of course TWO WEEKS OUT he is comfortable socializing on a playground or going through the MALL!<br /><br />I hated when he hugged the child he befriended at the library because I was so happy for the progress he made to interact and the grandma gets mad when he hugs him saying you only hug people you love. Jack responds that he did love him and the grandmas response was \\"you've never met him before in your life\\" well no kidding. The kid only met you 2 weeks ago, he has only met people two weeks ago! The grandma really did get under my skin.<br /><br />Anywho, I liked it, well written and it keeps you interested at all times.
B0078XM4SI|5.0|What is wrong with these people? The Cranberries never once faltered on this album. If lyrics are a problem for you, I offer a challenge. Start the album on track 7, loop it so it starts track 1 after roses. Then come back and write a review raving of the lyrics, \\"like I knew you would,\\" (Dolores O'Riordan, Roses). Yes the album is great, give it a chance. You've not heard from them in a while but its pure Cranberries. This album has a genuine mix of song styles from all previous albums. My most favorites are... the whole album. Just wish there were more songs, as soon I as I heard this on Pandora, I went straight to Amazon, downloaded the album and have not stop listening. Enjoy, Cranberry fans, its awesome!

1451626657|5.0|Is there any book quite like this one?<br /><br />Catch-22\\" is my favorite novel. Of all time.  To adapt an old saying, if an infinite number of monkeys were to type an infinite number of words for an infinite amount of time, THESE would be my favorite 170,000-odd words they could possibly type.<br /><br />There are other works that attempt to emulate this one, and many may receive some of the same adjectives when reviewed--zany, heartfelt, comic, tragic, classic, passionate, absurd, painful, hilarious--but, simply put, there is no book like this one.<br /><br />Even Joseph Heller couldn't escape his masterpiece.  Though the author--a self-admited plodding writer--wrote several more novels, there was nothing to equal his triumph here.  Such is the price of such an early tour de force.<br /><br />That said, \\"Catch-22\\" is certainly not for everyone.  The novel is often...<br />NON-SEQUENTIAL: It skips forward and backward in time (see \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\"), to great effect;<br />VIOLENT: Occasionally extreme and shocking;<br />BIZARRE: A captain named Major Major Major, for example;<br />ILLOGICAL: Even if you discount \\"non-sequential\\" and \\"bizarre\\";<br />ANTI-HEROIC: The protagonist cares for nothing more than his own skin;<br />COUNTER-CULTURAL: The U.S. generals are painted as insane and vain, even bombing their own airport;<br />ABSURDIST: A character stuffs his cheeks with crab apples, to name but one;<br />TRAGIC: There are moments that left me tearful;<br />HILARIOUS: Any sequence involving the phrase \\"Catch-22,\\" for instance;<br /><br />While all of the above is true--and perhaps because of it--there is no reading experience like this one.  I read the novel when I was a high school sophomore, sometime around 1968, and in some ways liken the experience reading it to my sensations as I watched the movie \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"--I might not have always understood what I just witnessed, but I knew it was unique, important, and transcended other works.<br /><br />There are some people I've met who have told me they would not read the book simply BECAUSE so many other people constantly reference it that they now believe themselves to be inured.  I would liken these naysayers to those who avoid followers who continuously allude to, say, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail,\\" tirelessly tryng to one-up fellow \\"Grail\\"-ers by quoting dialogue line-by-line.  I, too, have been around those devotees when it comes to such works, patiently sitting by (or, I admit it, even joining in) while they quote this character or that scene with the reverence of the true disciple.<br /><br />But this is that kind of book, a watershed novel that pre-dated other great works of literature or movie or TV like, say, \\"M*A*S*H\\" or \\"Hitch-hiker's Guide\\" or \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" or \\"The Gone-Away World.\\"  It is a truly great anti-war classic that reads like an amusement park thrill ride, ushering its reader on a cavalcade of experiences and emotions that should leave the appreciative breathless and angry and thrilled, but never apathetic.<br /><br />Like with any great work, the reader who finishes the book should find that his or her own understanding of the novel will vary from others', and I am willing to admit that some may not appreciate the work like, well, I do, but I would find it hard to believe that the book will not create in them a unique emotive experience.  There is so much happening within this novel that any one aspect of it warrants investigation: the general who cares nothing for his men other than risking their lives to get his own praiseworthy article in the Saturday Evening Post; the officer-turned-capitalist who convinces the commanders to remove parachutes and replace them with IOUs, or replace food with cotton; the innocent young soldier who is willing to give up his life to save a cynical whore who cares nothing for him; the shy major who will only allow office visitors when he is anywhere but actually IN his office; the living doctorwho has been declared dead and now walks around like a spectre; the pilot who continuously ditches his plane for practice...<br /><br />See?  I'm doing it myself.<br /><br />Read this book.  It is the one true classic that I can honestly say I have read and re-read and read again, and still hope I live long enough to read it twice more.  It's that good.who has been declared dead and now walks around like a spectre; the pilot who continuously ditches his plane for practice...<br /><br />See?

0312370849|3.0|Spoiler Alert<br /><br />I ended up liking this book a lot more than I thought I would. Though personally I think she should have ended up with Guillaume and not William. William seemed like it just fit too perfectly and I like the way that Guillaume and her interacted. Though I guess they didn't actually say they were getting together but you know that is the author's intention.<br /><br />I found Bertrand to be an only 2-dimensional character, I understand he has a lot of flaws but he is her husband and really should have been fleshed out more. Edouard (her father-in-law) has way less page wise in the book but he is more dimensional than her husband. I agree with Kate that her husband feels like he was supposed to be there just so they could have a bad guy.<br /><br />Though I knew that French had some involvement in the Holocaust I did not know to the extent that they did and how much horror was actually done with nothing more than the French's hands. This book really brought you to the experiences of the people as they walked on and rode the trains and the horrid conditions they endured. At times I really felt that I could see it all as if I was witnessing it, which is the way I felt when reading Night by Elie Wiesel.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone with interest in the Holocaust but it is also a good book if that isn't an area of interest for you.
B004EPZ00C|5.0|Quality was great, received the DVD in good condition, and really enjoy being a customer with Amazon so far.  As for the movie:  This man is so funny!!!  Johnny English Reborn is even funnier than the first movie.  That is most unusual for the sequels to be better than the original but it is.  We even loved the directors commentary.  It showed even more how hard everyone worked and just seemed to enjoy the project immensely.  We all had a great time watching this for family night.  Everyone was laughing about as hard as I was.  We never buy a movie until we have seen it first and determine if it's a keeper for our collection.  But, we just had a feeling about this one and so glad we have a copy.  If you need to raise your spirits, get this movie; because anytime you need a good laugh this DVD will do the trick.
0805092447|5.0|My daughter is 4 and she loves to \\"read\\" this book on her own. It's a book with beautiful illustrations and simple words that allowed her to memorize it and \\"read\\" it on her own. It is her favorite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If you like adventure, drama, and a little romance at the side, this is for you. Didn't want to put it down ( nor did I want to put down the two following books).
0439023521|5.0|The thing I didn't like about The Hunger Games is I don't own the next book.  : (<br /><br />There are some spoilers in the review below so read at your own risk.<br /><br />I expected to like this book, as I tend to enjoy the genre, but I was surprised by how caught up I was in the book and the characters, it was actually a page turner, unlike a lot of things I have read lately.<br /><br />I loved the book. The author kept such a good pace, which can be hard with a book that has so many small and HUGE moments.  The characters were believably likeable and dislikeable.  And just as if this book was written by Joss Whedon himself, my favorite character died. Though I guess you should never fall for a character that is a contestant in the hunger games.<br />For a plot that is not original in the least, the author does a great job of keeping it fresh and making parts of it her own.  She does a great job describing the surroundings and the world the story takes place in but at the same time doesn't bog you down with imagery.<br />I love the characters she created, even the ones I didn't like.  Peeta is a great guy without being perfect. Katniss is wonderfully skilled and caring but has major emotional issues.  Prim seems helpless at first but when you hear about the way she can heal and stand by people when they look, and smell, the worst, it gave me a whole new way of looking at her.<br /><br />Rue's death ripped me in two. I mean I saw it coming: 1) It is the Hunger Games, people go there to die, 2) Katniss was getting too comfortable with having Rue around, and 3) Kat needed a catalyst to really get her head in the games.  I loved and ached that Rue screams out to Kat and she responds and kills the career without a hesitation, and that later you can tell she is still human  because she feels bad that she killed someone.<br /><br />On that note, I am glad that Kat kills someone (besides just with the tracker jackers), it would have been unbelievable that she would havemade it through the whole game without it. I felt it was more real.<br /><br />The fear I have for Kat and Peeta now with the Capitol closely watching them is great.  I actually worry for them, which considering they are fictional...Go you Suzanne Collins, go you.<br /><br />In short, good writing, fabulous pace, and wonderfully flushed out and believable characters (even the side ones) makes me no longer wonder how this book series took off. I book worth talking about.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Just love having these finally in DVD.  Brought back memories of family sitting around watching these on TV.  Had old copies on VHS and was very pleased with the quality of these DVD's.  My daughter had to borrow them right away to view.  Gave my parents a good laugh when we shared them on a recent trip. Really liked the history behind the show and the case artwork that they came in.  Makes the set even more special to us. Thanks ever so much!!
B000IKQMFO|3.0|I love Downton Abbey so after seeing a interview with Jullian Fellows I thought I'd give the much talked about Gosford Park a shot. First, I know Jullian Fellows has his favorite actors but are there not more British actors for the minor rules? I love Maggie Smith and I'd watch her in just about anything but the minor roles are always filled by the same actors who are pretty much playing in the same period piece so it's getting boring.<br /><br />It was good but it's wasn't good enough to make me want to watch it again.
B006QPVGKG|5.0|The clearity on this movie was fantasic. There was no delays or interruption in play. I watched this from my television set and it worked great! I will continue using Amazon videos and movie through my Roku device!

0061537969|4.0|I really did like this book A LOT more than I thought I would. It was well written and for the most part I believe a dog would actually think a lot of these things. Enzo is a good narrator and I adored him so quickly that I was sad it was a dog book, because we all know how those end. There were people who infuriated me when things go wrong but they act exactly how people do in the situations in real life, I won't go into detail because of spoilers (but let's just say the Twins and Annika). But Enzo's spark, Danny's determination and the few good people in Danny's life made the book more bearable with all the badness going about. All in all a good book and I don't like racing so that says something
B0054JZC6E|3.0|so far kinda a pain. the darts are biased lol. but I guess its a way to kill time so yeah.
0393064476|1.0|Just another book that tries to blame Christians, who were in fact often victims, for anything and everything. It shows how poor modern scholarship has become. Try Holland's The Forge of Christendom or Goldsworthy's How Rome Fell.
0887431453|4.0|There are lots of great workbook pages. They are able to be torn out. The ages seem to be a bit off. My daughter is 3 and some of these are just too hard for her. She is able to write all her letters and numbers, but the connecting the dots and some of the other activities are too advanced. I guess we'll just have to space out the lessons or get another book to supplement for now.

Then throw in a little Bolt.<br /><br />Ta-da!!----  Tin Tin!!!<br /><br />Nice specials, so two stars instead of one, but that's about it.  I've never fallen asleep at an animated movie before, let alone an actions one.  Mr. Spielberg should feel honored.  Deeply honored.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|We gave this to one of our kids for Christmas. Three months later, he still plays with it a couple of times a week and hasn't mastered everything on it yet. So far, it hasn't broken.<br /><br />It is good for developing fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and persistence.<br /><br />It isn't for every kid, though. We have another child who tried it a couple of times and then lost interest.

159514188X|5.0|One of my 7th grade girls (I teach middle school English) read this book and then shared it with me. I couldn't put it down. I had considered this book for one of my classes, but wasn't comfortable about introducing suicide to my students. However,I'm glad one of my girls picked it up on her own. This was a powerful book. I hope students who do read this will see how they can affect others, and how they can make a difference.

B005LLX582|3.0|This movie uses family as a theme on meditation about nature and grace.  As one of the protagonists in a movie says \\"Nature just is, grace we accept.\\"  It is a film about a family in which three young boys grow up.  Their father is domineering and harsh in attempt to prepare them to the life of adulthood which is full of disappointments and failed hope.  As a head of the family, this father carries the responsibility of providing for his family the best he can.  He has pushed aside his true passion for music in order to devote his life to engineering that is supposed to bring financial stability to the family.  In spite of having 26 patents and never missing a day of work, after 14 years of working for the same company he finds himself forced to accept a job no one else wants in order to preserve his career and his job.  But these realities put pressure on this man who takes it out on his family - his wife and his three sons.<br /><br />This movie is part fantasy, part meditation, part visual feast.  It is definitely not meant to please mass audiences.  It is digging deep into human psyche and it explores how we, as human beings, turn out to be the way we are.  What part of us in innate, what part of ourselves we inherit from our parents and our surroundings, what part of our life experiences molds us into who we are?  There are moments when this film turns into visual masterpiece.  However, the narrative side of it diminishes great potential this film could have had.  One feels restless and less at peace after watching this film.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|Whenever I get an email that has embedded emails as attachments (multiple levels), Hotmail downloads the first one, but can't launch it.

Hotmail needs to fix this.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|There are many great reviews on the series & books so I'll keep this review on the quality of the HD transfer.<br /><br />In a nutshell: WOW!!<br /><br />I loved this show on HBO, but it is so much better on Blu-ray. The only flaw I've seen (if you could call it that) is a slight banding on the fade-in of a few scenes. It only lasts a split second and you'd miss it if you blink, so I wouldn't even count it. You can see every stitch on the clothing as well as every rough edge on leather. Every stray hair is perfectly visible.<br /><br />The skin tones fit the scenes and colors are bright, but not artificial. Every blade of grass stands perfectly visible. Detail this good shows every flaw in make-up and digital special effects, yet I never noticed any.<br /><br />Audio is full-immersion; it's well balanced without the rear speakers being over used. A good sub is a must to get the full effect. The character's lines are clear, even though you can hear everything going on in the background. If you have neighbors nearby, invite them over because they're going to hear it anyway & if they're watching with you they won't be calling in a noise complaint on you.<br /><br />My only real complaint (minor, though it is) is the packaging; there's nothing really wrong with it (in fact most people will like it for it's character portraits), I just prefer thin, simple cases instead of fancy ones that take up more space on my shelves. The discs are properly held in place, but easy to remove. You do have to completely unfold the case to get to the first disc.<br /><br />If you have a good TV and sound system, get the Blu-ray. DVD's are nice, but can't compare to the clarity & the sound alone makes this the better choice.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is my 2nd favorite of the story games.  The controls are very responsive and the graphics are crisp and cute.  I'm playing this on my kindle fire and it's the perfect size screen.  Parents I would suggest you disable in app purchases as you can run the tab up very quickly.  Feel free to add me for this and bakery story, &quot;meanestmom&quot;.
B004TJ1H32|5.0|I originally owned the 2-DVD set.  I bought the blu ray only because I got it dirt cheap ($8.36, to be exact), would have better picture quality, and would now have all the extras on one disc rather than having to shuffle between two.<br /><br />The first time I popped the blu ray disc in, my eyes were amazed!  The picture quality is SO much better than the DVD, far beyond what I expected.  There were tiny details I wasn't seeing on DVD that I do see on Blu Ray, details that greatly improve enjoyment of the movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Katniss is not the smartest character in this book. She is not the bravest, nor the kindest, the most cunning or the most talented. She is not the strongest. In the words of her inebriated mentor, Haymitch, what she has is spunk. She is smart enough, brave enough, kind enough to get through. Her better angel frequently gets the better of her rational thought, but not so much that she is made weak by it.<br /><br />Her spunk is of a particularly enduring nature that could not be replicated by one of the Career kids, outright gladiators who have been training for this all their lives. Although they have skills and cruelty, they don't have the dogged determination to keep going because someone else is depending on you. Katniss almost can't recall a time that she was not the responsible adult in the family. She does not really think of her life as a set of choices, but as a set of obligations to support her choice to take care of her family. And I bet if you asked her, she never thought of taking care of her family as a choice, just What One Does.<br /><br />I think her lack of exceptionality makes it easier to relate to her, to think about ourselves in that same position. Thematically, this book reminded me of Richard Bachman/Stephen King's The Long Walk. It is also about deadly contests for the amusement of the populace. I am a bit revolted by my own cheering for our hero to win, since it means so many others will lose. I think that internal revulsion is an important part of the emotional weight of the book, since we are complicit in hoping for those deaths. Unlike the long walk, the Hunger Games make a life-and-death difference to the people back home. The winner secures extra food, extra calories for a whole year. Children who sign up for extra chances to be sent to the games can buy enough starvation rations for their family. And anyone who survives will never be hungry again.<br /><br />This is one of the hungriest books I've ever read. Some books have that deep atmosphere feeling. I can only read Ice Station Zebra in the dead of summer, and Seven Pillars of Wisdom in the cool damp winter, lest the books themselves make my atmosphere unlivable. This book made me hungry -- not for madelines or stew or home cooking, but just for food. In Cryptonomicon, Stephenson posists a \\"realistic\\" roleplaying game, where 90% of the game time is about acquiring, preserving, and eating food. This is the book of that game.<br /><br />Katniss, herself named after a food item, recognizes that this is what drives her:<br /> What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and I'm not really sure who I am, what my identity is.<br /><br />I really liked the structure of this book. On the surface, the plot seems straightforward. However, I think this will be one of the series that goes from the particulars of one person to the general of the whole world. This book is about Katniss doing her best in the face of changing circumstances. She has to adapt or die. And she has to accept that death may be the easy option, and perhaps she is going to have to do even harder things than learn to hope again. Peeta is the story's moral center, the standard against which Katniss ends up measuring herself. At the risk of crossing the streams, I feel about Peeta the way I ended up feeling about Neville in the Harry Potter books. He is greater than even he believes, and it is his solidity and grace that allows our heroes to get through what they need to do.<br /><br />My critique is that I was left desperately wishing  for more information about the world -- how big is District 12? How big are the other districts? Who maintains the rail tracks? That sort of thing. I think that curiosity is an excellent sign that the world is real and vibrant. I want to explore it in my mind, in a way I don't need to in a world that has less bearing on the story. I am sure subsequent books will also make things clearer.<br /><br />The writing is not perfect, but I found it compelling, and given the speed I was reading at, I did not stop to complain. I will forgive quite a lot in someone who grabs me as thoroughly as Collins did, and doesn't let go until the very end of the story.<br /><br />Read if: you love a good story about a hero who is not a superhero. You like books full of allusion and subtle foreshadowing.

0440245931|5.0|This was my third John Grisham book that I have read in the last two weeks and It may be my favorite.  It was a little slow in the beginning, but once I got to about the third or fourth chapter I was finished in no time.  436 pages but each one turns easily with the reader eager to find out what is next.  Great story, great characterization.  Grisham may be my new favorite writer.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Awesome Headset. Now there is no need for me to charge a wireless headset during gaming for hours on end, just wish the cord was longer than 16 feet.
B003O86FMW|5.0|An excellent book, in fact this trilogy was the best that I have read in a very long time.  I had a hard time putting the book down, and that hasn't happened a lot lately.  I wish she would do another series!
B003TXS5AC|5.0|It was a great addition to my husband's vinyl record set.  He loved it and it made him very happy and surprised!
0060936223|5.0|How lucky anyone would be to have Patti Smith for a friend. From the first paragraph I couldn't put this book down.<br />Beautifully written by a woman who appears to have been born the passionate, talented woman she would become. Her kindness is palpable throughout. I would have loved to be as brave as she to strike out on my own the way she did as a young woman but I'm neither brave nor talented. I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks a memoir from someone speaking from the deepest part of their heart and soul.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|I liked a lot the book, but seems like the author wants to impress with his vocabulary, I don't know if my english is poor, but even when I got the dictionary to translate some words, I also need my native dictionary language to find the meaning of some words that he could use just a simple synonymous. For that reason the reading was kind of heavy for me. But the concept behind this books is very useful for anyone who wants to create a startup.
B0017HMF6W|4.0|Hitch & Grant - nobody does it better! Loved the light comedy touches. Just the right touch of comedy, mystery and romance - AND CARY GRANT!!!!! They don't make them like this anymore. Hollywood lost two unreplaceable icons with their passing!
1439192812|5.0|Excellent book to read to children to help them understand the \\"big\\" questions. I'm sure I will end up sharing this book with neighbors and friends as their children are starting to ask the same questions.

B003QTWR08|5.0|A wonderful movie to watch and is well worth having in the video library for repeated watching.  Movie is cute, entertaining, with  a plot one may realize this world may be faced with.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using YouVision for over a year and the app just keeps on getting better. One of my favorite features of this app is the interactive notes that churches can post for services and events. I also love being able to look at passages in multiple versions of the Bible. I am currently going through the chronological reading plan and I am really enjoying it.
B0032FPVKE|4.0|this bag was smaller than i thought it was. my fault for not reading the dimensions.<br /><br />I was able to fit my Nikon Coolpix L105 and my Samsung HMX-Q10 into it simultaneously. not too much room for cables after both of those are in there. it will fit extra SD cards, etc.
B0069JBKHI|5.0|Withings really went all out. From the packaging to product design, the Apple influence is very apparent. I've been a frustrated user of two previous baby monitors. Before buying those, I did a good deal of research and each seemed to be the best on the market at the time. Well, now the market's changed. To start, the features cannot be beat, including some you'd see in other monitors: infrared night vision, the ability to talk through the monitor, temperature and humidity monitoring - and some that you might not: a night light that can change to any color in the RGB spectrum with a full intensity slider, completely customizable alerts for motion, sound, temperature & humidity (you can set the alert ranges), music that can be controlled from your phone (start, stop, volume & timer), digital zoom and panning, and charting of conditions history and record of alerts throughout the night.<br /><br />The setup was remarkably easy. It's probably slightly more difficult than your standard video monitor but given the technology involved, it's amazing how well they've designed setup. For instance, over bluetooth, your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad will send information about your WiFi connection to the monitor to get it connected the first time.<br /><br />The picture is very good - not great - but very good. It's definitely the best among video monitors I've seen. I think the resolution is sufficient, but the light sensor could benefit from being more sensitive. It seems to have to switch over to infrared too easily. The audio quality is also very good - better than our previous monitors.<br /><br />My wife and I each own an iPhone and because our phones are usually already with us, it's very convenient to be able to pull up the monitor on an app instead of having a separate monitoring device. When a sitter is over, we'll be able to show them how to use the iPad to do the same thing. So far, nighttime monitoring with the app running in the background has been working mostly without hitches. My wife told me that it stopped one night, but it hasn't happened again since - so I'm not sure what the deal was there.<br /><br />Being able to monitor it while you're away from home could come in handy. They only allow 15 minutes of monitoring per day from outside your home's connection for free, which is slightly disappointing. However, it should be sufficient for checking in on your little one who's home with the sitter while your away a few times. I don't know that there would be a need for letting the audio run while your out of the home - but you never know.<br /><br />Overall, this was a great buy. It's more expensive than other video monitors on the market, but the value is outstanding considering all you're getting. It'll be nice to see them fine tune and expand the software with time as well - which wouldn't be possible with most other monitors.
B005TKC2P2|3.0|With a lot of fuzz about Mr. Murakami's new book, IQ84 I read about it on reviews in Amazon.com. A recommandation was not to start up with the 1Q84 as the first book to read from the writer, Murakami. So I purchased \\"Kafka on the shore\\".<br />The book is OK. 2 plots are followed and in the end they merges as it is modern now. The book is well written easy to understand for me having english as my second language.<br />One thing I had hoped for with a japanese writer was an introduction to the japanese way of life, but either the way of thinking in Japan is the same as in Europe or the book is written for a western public. There are referrals to european thinkers and philosofers and to the old greece. Ødepus made a round in the theater also.
B004Q7CIFI|3.0|I just finished reading 11/23/63.  I bought it mainly because the idea of the book sounded intriguing.  The premise, I was given to believe from reading the inside book flap, was what the world would be like if President Kennedy had not been shot.  The author spends much of the book describing how the hero goes back in time, and only paints a small part of the book describing the \\"new future\\".  I was disappointed with this book.  I found it too wordy, and too wrapped up in the main villian.  I thought the book would deal more with life as it would play out from 11/24/63, had President Kennedy not been killed.
B006ZCWTV0|2.0|I'm surprised by the high ratings of this CD.<br /><br />I own every Bruce SPringsteen CD.  I put this CD down there with Devils & Dust, Ghost of Tom Joad.<br /><br />There was only one song that I thought was great - Rocky Ground.  I did like Wrecking Ball.<br /><br />The other songs either should have been cut or were mediocre.<br /><br />Someone wrote Bruce sounded very insincere on this CD like he didn't believe what he's selling and I would agree.<br /><br />He claims he speaks for the \\"working man\\", but I don't buy it.  As someone pointed out, why then does he charge $12.99 when other CDs go for $9.99.  That's a 30% increase on the poor working man.<br /><br />Personally, I wish I saved my money.  This is no Darkness on the Edge of Town or The Rising.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After all the hype, I just couldn't sell myself on this one until I had tons of people tell me it was wonderful.  Boy, was I missing out!  It took a few chapters for me to get into it since I'd seen the movie previews so I had an idea of what to expect, but man, was it great!  Such a fast read and I couldn't put it down.  Now I can't wait to get started on the others.
B004EPZ0AM|4.0|I dont know why people have reviewed this movie so low. I took my three year old to this in the theater and he loved it. While I do not think it is a good as the first movie, it is very cute and heartwarming. I was nervous they would not find someone to replace Brittney Murphy, or do her character's justice, however Pink stepped in and wowed me. She did great as Gloria. If you are the parent of a young child, or someone who enjoyed Happy Feet, at least give this one a chance. It is not as awesome as the first movie, however its still cute and worth watching. (maybe more so if you have kids)
B000B589JI|5.0|Tricky caps. Good thing. There is 3 different twists caps. The bottom one allows u to see a capsule space to insert fuel or even medicine pills. But baad to use pills once fuel is in there. Good durable cap no leaks, easy pour with tiny side hole with air, zippo logo may scratch off so put tape over it to keep the logo on.<br /><br />Twist cap loosens depends on in/out of pocket number of times. This can last lifetime!

B005HSG3VK|2.0|The Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover was not what I expected.  It was very cheap looking.  I think the black plastic stand would break in a very short time.  I was looking for something that would close also.  The black stand just folded over the front of the Kindle.  I didn't feel it was going to protect my Kindle Fire.  Now back to the drawing board to find a cover to protect my Kindle Fire.

B005SFS4ZU|1.0|I am quite disappointed with the Blue Ray version of this play. The followings are the problems I encountered.<br />1. The output gain is so low I have to crank up the volume control to find the acceptable level of sound while playing.<br />2. Although it claims to have 5.1 soundtrack, there is almost no information from the surround speakers. They should have picked up more ambient sound of the ROYAL ALABERT HALL to create the atmosphere. The sound from the front mostly comes from the two main speakers only.<br />3. Although the sonic picture is right in front of me, it is only two dimensional. I cannot feel the depth of the orchestra.<br />4. Christine's voice seems to be ok, but whenever she needs to reach the high note, the orchestra plays very loud and covers her voice. Did they do this deliberately to cover up her weakness in this part ? I have no way to tell. It could be my own impression.<br />5. The quality of the mask is poor. I can actually see the gap in between from the left side. I checked the movie of this play and nothing likes this happened. This proves that they did not pay attention to every details.<br /><br />In case you already have the movie of this play, don't waste your money, I found the movie is more enjoyable.
1612130607|1.0|Listen up people - we would all love to have a man who is rich and gorgeous fall for us, right? But imagine walking on eggshells for the rest of your life because he is so controlling. What's so romantic about a guy flipping his lid so easily? I wouldn't do it no matter how Hot the guy is! All the heroine could think about was how hot and gorgeous Christian is...and we have to read it on nearly every page! I'm sorry he had such a brutal childhood, that doesn't mean we want the female to be totally submissive. She gets angry yes, but immediately caves because he is so hot! Geez! Gimme a strong heroine anyday. Btw, his name should have been smirk since he was always smirking. And she should have been, Oh...my

B006MQRLSA|5.0|Inspiring story how Billy Beane took conventional wisdom and turned it on its head.  The story of Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane's successful attempt to put together a baseball club on a budget by employing computer-generated analysis to draft his players.
0525478817|5.0|I found it amazing how much I could relate to the situations that Hazel and Gus went through.<br />I especially remember the beginning of the book where they were in Cancer support group.  John Green describes exactly how it feels to be in a support group like that.  Now I don't have cancer mine is a mental illness but I have felt and thought about all the things Hazel and Gus had.<br /><br />Now I read a lot of people cried or teared up while reading some of this book.  I didn't but I still found much of the book endearing and truthful.  The connection between the main characters was at times funny, loving and scary.  I say scary because they both take chances with loving each other, just as anyone else would be taking.<br /><br /> Even though some of the characters have Cancer or an illness the book isn't dark.  It is actually very joyful and book that could be read over again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  I use it daily.  If you read the Bible on a regular basis, download this app.  It has all the most common translations so you can read which ever you are most comfortable with.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This product does not disappoint when it comes to capturing some of our planets most amazing sites and bizarre lifeforms! It's amazing how alien these creatures and places can be but yet, we know we could see them for ourselves if we just went out to look! It's hard to describe. But for those who are interested in exploring this planet from their homes (maybe because you are just too busy right now) it's really amazing and is the next best thing to actually being there! Although there is a scene involving the worlds largest pile of dung! so I guess maybe in some respects, it's actually more pleasant to watch from the comfort of your own home!
B006JP11HQ|5.0|Fascinating.  What was written by this very intelligent man 50 years ago is even more truthful today.  Very thought provoking.  Also, every interesting how the political parties have changed and getting votes is more important than advancing our society.  Who is looking out for us?
B005OCFHHK|3.0|After recieving item realised it was in blu ray but when I purchased item it didn't say anything about being blu ray. I know I clicked on the normal DVD not blu ray. So as a result we cannot watch the item unless we pay out even more on a blu ray player. Oh and I payed £20 more on here than what they are in asda.
B006HGXGWU|3.0|I won't ruin things with a spoiler, but in my opinion the film is building up to something, and the ending simply opens up more questions than it solves. As for the preceding hour and forty-five minutes, it moves at a deathly slow pace most of the time. The camera lingers on people who are doing little but staring or moving slowly as if drugged. This could be helped with editing, but even so, I wonder if a story about a man's life unraveling (almost) due to forces he cannot understand can be made into high entertainment without some sort of payoff. There is very little payoff.<br /><br />Good points? The dialog is well-written and well-acted. But the movie is poorly paced, and in my opinion poorly plotted. I certainly have some sympathy for what the man (and his family) goes through. In the end, it's not enough.
0553386794|5.0|Couldnt put this book down. Lots of action and deceit. When i finished reading it, i couldnt wait to get the next book in the series.
0385534639|4.0|I've been a kindle owner since Christmas (thanks to my husband) and this book was my biggest buy so far and I was torn throughout most of the book as to whether I was duped or pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />There are many characters, most seemed more like filler pages than anything else. But, as I continued to read I realized that they were just as important to the flow of this book and how well it all worked together. I admit to skipping or skimming a few chapters to get to who I felt was the heroin or hero, expecting certain actions to happen and getting upset when they didn't appear. This was my biggest mistake, and it was the cause of my reluctance throughout the book.<br /><br />The books I have read in the past seemed almost identical, just insert a different name or place and you get the same outcome. I guess even though it is frustrating to me, it is what I come to expect. This book is definitely not like that, you have to keep an open mind while reading this book and please leave your expectations behind.<br /><br />It is a wonderful story, one that I plan on reading again because I know that it is worth a second read.

1439102732|5.0|This is my first book to read by this author and I came away feeling, wow, this would have made an even better movie than Brokeback Mountain had been. I was near tears at the ending. I'm off to read another book by Jodi as I was very impressed with the writing and the story in this one I just finished.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The Doors self-titled debut is one of the greatest albums of '60s. This is The Doors at their most original and consistent. Also their most hard rock offering although there's a lot of blues and psychedelic influences in it. It's hit after hit with classic tracks like \\"Break On Through\\" and \\"The Crystal Ship\\".

B0055Q5F36|1.0|I bought this case for my mom.  She had it for a few months, so it's not like it didn't protect it at all.  But, she dropped it at a store and the screen cracked, while this case was on it.  I'd suggest trying the \\"Defender\\" series Otterbox, or something else.  I haven't used the Defender series, but hear it's better.
