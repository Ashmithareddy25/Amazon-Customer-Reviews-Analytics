B000002JSJ|4.0|&quot;Presence&quot; has been called many things from a generally good album to the start of the downfall of Led Zeppelin. Neither assessment is correct. What is true is that &quot;Presence&quot; is the most underrated Zep album. It follows closely behind Zep's finest album &quot;Physical Graffitti&quot; which tends to overshadow all of Led Zep's work. The fact is that no rock fan should be without &quot;Presence&quot;. &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; is probably the group's hardest sounding song &amp; stands up nicely with other faves like &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; &amp; &quot;Kashmir&quot;. &quot;For Your Life&quot; displays awesome work from all 4 band members &amp; so does &quot;Hots On For Nowhere&quot;. My personal favorite from &quot;Presence&quot; is &quot;Tea For One&quot;. Led Zep does the blues so well &amp; this is actually among my top 3 Zep tunes.<BR> You can never go wrong with Led Zeppelin &amp; &quot;Presence&quot; will blow you away.

B000001FFJ|5.0|While I wait in agony for &quot;Blood Money&quot; &amp; &quot;Alice&quot; to hit the stores in May, the best I can do is turn to the uncountable number of albums Tom Waits has already put out. Among the best of them is &quot;Rain Dogs&quot;. Tom Waits, who has the voice of a 'Muppet' &amp; a flair for genius as a writer, gives another top notch look at bottom-of-the-barrel characters. Right from the start of &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; we hear a blanket of jaunty tunes of all shapes, sizes, &amp; colors. The title track is just one of the wonderful glimpses we get into Waits' world.  Right from the 1st track, &quot;Singapore&quot;, the listener gets to cavort &amp; carouse &amp; rabble-rouse alongside Waits' various nighthawks until the end. We even get to hear the original version of Rod Stewart's hit &quot;Downtown Train&quot;. (Waits' version is better, duh!)<BR> I've never heard Tom Waits put out a bad album, but if you're looking for one of his best, &quot;Rain Dogs&quot; is it.

630179513X|5.0|\\"Back to the Future Part III\\" is, in my opinion, the best of the entire trilogy. Of course, that's just my opinion, but I can't be wrong because it's a point of view, right? That out of the way, let's get to some heavy duty praising for one of our best directors, Robert Zemeckis. There are very few directors who have such a love for the craft of filmmaking that, when you see their work on the screen, you know they were going totally buckwild, just having the time of their lives with all the gadgets at their disposal. Sam Raimi is one, Spielberg, Shyamalan, and Lucas are three more, and definitely our dear Bob Zemeckis. All you have to do is look at his menagerie of films: \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\", \\"Forrest Gump\\", and \\"What Lies Beneath\\". Even though I didn't like \\"What Lies Beneath\\", it still had some of the coolest camera moves I've seen in recent years. But come on, \\"Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"Forrest Gump\\", not to mention said trilogy are classics, filled with remarkable visuals and a wonderful sense of humanity. \\"Back to the Future Part III\\" is no exception to that rule.<br />This isn't usually revered as the best of the films. In fact, other than a few friends of mine, the only critic I know of to agree is Leonard Maltin. But I believe it to be for a few reasons. First, this is by far the most fast-paced entry in the trilogy. It moves from scene to scene at 88 mph and never stops until the end. Secondly, despite this enormously fast pace, it never ceases to have a beating heart at its center. The love story in the film, which finally revolves around Doc, is very sweet, and the friendship between Doc and Marty continues to grow. Third, the dialogue in this film seems like it went into hyperkinetic overdrive. It zips! That's why, even in a film of mostly character driven scenes, it never loses pace. There's also a very clever reversal of character stereotyping between Doc and Marty that I'm glad they saved for this film. If it had been in the second or even the first one, it wouldn't have come off as well.<br />But anyway, as is the usual with the plot of these films, look at the title. We are in the year 1885, and Marty has torn the fuel line on the DeLorean, which looks really hilarious with white-wall tires from 1955. So, in order to get the time machine up to 88 mph, Doc devises a plan to hijack... oh, sorry... borrow a locomotive, and using some very specially made crystal logs, getting the boiler hot enough to push the time machine back to the future. Meanwhile, we've got the threat of a duel with good old Biff's grandfather, Buford \\"Mad Dog\\" Tannen, and the aforementioned love story between Doc and a teacher named Clara who he managed to save before a grisly fall to her death. All very simple, all very smartly done, using all the cliches from spaghetti westerns to its advantage, and with incredible visual effects for its action-packed, explosive finale.<br />It's really hard not to like this series of films. I don't know anyone who doesn't like them. And I think most of that has to do with the fact that, even with all the wackiness and special effects and one-liners and comedy, what really draws people to these films is that the characters are us: They don't react all that differently from how we would. And we all wonder from time to time what would happen if we could go back and change our past, or if one little different thing happened, how would we turn out? The \\"Back to the Future\\" films address all of these things with a whole lot of brains, heart, and laughter.nd or even the first one, it wouldn't have come off as well.<br />But anyway, as is the usual with the plot of these films, look at the title.

B00003CXSP|1.0|This is one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. The script is tacky, the acting is uninspired, and the violence is completely gratuitous and is filmed in a highly distasteful way. It seems Scott wanted to glorify the good ol' American obsession with serial killers, but he has done so to a ridiculous degree. Like other of his films, the content is boring and ill thought out and the entire efforts of the filmmakers seem to have been spent on making it 'look good'. It does, but because the subject matter is so tired and uninteresting, as well as gratuitous, the film comes off as excessively distasteful. If you want to be scared, go see Texas Chainsaw massacre, where violence is TERRIFYING and well used. If you want a film that looks good afer this style, go see Gladiator - even though it too is overproduced and under-performed, at least IT has a story. This is just like a kind of overproduced car commercial with a lot of blood and guts being thrown about. It's embarrasingly poor.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is a great film, although not perfect it's damn good. Without going off on all the plot twists. If you like &quot;strange&quot; movies, like Fincher's Se7en and Fight Club, theres a good chance you will like this film... I strongly reccomend seeing it.
B000002IPZ|5.0|In a previous review for Testament-The Gathering i said that that was their best album.  However, after listening to Souls of Black a lot recently I would have to say that this is their best one.  This album is really the ultimate thrash album and Chuck Billy is the best singer in the genre.  The production on this cd is surprisingly good and there are a lot of stand out tracks.  This album is fast and heavy and perfect for any thrash metal fan.  The best songs on here are Face in the Sky, Souls of Black, Malpractice, and The Legacy.  Buy this if you're into thrash or if you don't have this cd.
B0000542DH|5.0|This movie although shoking and even gruesome to most movie goers and renters...I am surprised that is so.  This is a very serious psychological movie and is awesome when you read between the lines in this film.  I found myself grossed out and also enlightened.<br />Most people would pass this off as a dysfunctional family retold again and again as usual, but that is not the case.  This is a moving and powerful picture of life, and how things happen with some people...
B000002IOY|5.0|Overkill are one of the best thrash metal bands to every play.  They are up there with Testament, Metallica(old), Slayer, Megadeth, Exodus, and Anthrax.  This album proves that and is an instant classic.  Every song on here stands out and the songwriting is brilliant.  There are super fast songs like Evil Never Dies and Elimination and slower yet heavy songs like Who Tends the Fire and Playing With Spiders.  Overkill write brilliant riffs that make you want to bash your friends face in with a bat.  This album can be played thousands of times and never get old.  The production on this is really good too.  I reccomend this to any thrash fan.

B00005JKJA|4.0|I just thought I'd mention a couple of things - I really enjoyed this movie, but the first time I saw it the last half-hour completely confused me.  I just bought the DVD, which came out today, and immediately watched the last half hour, and although I will not explain everything here (you can probably figure it out if you care) it does make sense, that is, there is a logic to it, it's just something that's so hard to believe the first time you see it that one's mind utterly fails to put the pieces together.  However, I have not watched the movie all the way through yet now that I understand it, so I can't really give a final verdict on whether it totally works or not, whether it's flawed or not.  I'm hoping it's not, but can't say yet.  However, I thought the tone of the film was mindblowingly good, and original. The way he is able to get inside a kind of dream logic and utterly defy it becoming silly or ironic is staggering. Nobody else is doing anything like it. He is a real master.  Beyond that, all I want to mention is that the complete lack of bonus material on the DVD is disappointing.  It doesn't even have chapters, which is I guess some sort of deliberate decision, perhaps on Lynch's part, I don't know.  It's not that big a deal, but it is odd, and was mildly annoying given that I happened to want to just watch the end again, so had to fast forward through the rest of it.  Perhaps Lynch doesn't want us to do that, thus the lack of chapters?  I don't know.  Anyway, extraordinary movie. That's the main thing.
B00005RFAI|5.0|In Pink's second cd, it's all about emotion. &quot;Misundazstood&quot; creates a mural of Pink's many mixed moods and in the end winds up painting a marvelous canvas of song. Her beats range from the hip hop that will make you jump right outta your seat, to the more somber side of the disc, with melodies that stick in your head and lyrics that make you think. Pink has gotten a lot more mature in her singing, and it shows on her new cd. But don't worry, there's still lots of funky good times tunes packed into it!
B00005JKBC|4.0|Robert Redford was in two films that were released at pretty much the same time:  The Last Castle and Spy Game.  Both are good films, but although Spy Game is more significant, I found that I preferred the Last Castle because the story is told so straightforwardly.  I'm not complaining about the flashbacks in Spy Game -- this film had an excellent concept and script.  But Spy Game's director plays around with odd camera angles and visual effects that show up well in video games but that greatly interfere with the story.  Some of these angles and effects work well, especially on the big screen in the theatres, but a number do not.  Film being a visual medium, the director should have given some consideration to the fact that human eyes can only see so much or handle so much shifting before they start to weary or the audience starts getting annoyed and disaffected.  These effects are only worsened when played on your TV screen.  In places, the electronic soundtrack is raucous, also detracting from the story and also seeming like video game material.  Extras on this DVD are pretty run of the mill -- deleted scenes and an alternate ending that really only had one or two more scenes at the end of the hero's Porsche driving off into the sunset but not an alternate storyline, as the idea of an alternate ending imples.  There are multiple commentaries from director and producers, if you like that sort of thing.  I was hoping for a \\"The Making of...\\" documentary. There is one,in a way, but it is embedded in the film.  You have to turn on the Ops feature, then page through the film.  Each chapter has a Classified icon.  Press enter when you see it and some details or some films of the set play with various crew members or the director speaking.  This paging through chapters in search of these scenes gets old pretty fast.  The story in this film, though, is fantastic -- a very deep drama with superb acting.  I'd forgotten how good an actor Brad Pitt was!  Redford was smootherin The Last Castle -- in Spy Game, he tends to use his habit of pausing, pausing, pausing to let the camera stay on his closeups a bit too long, and he is awkward in a few scenes, but for the most part, he takes over this story and runs with it, giving us a solid and convincing performance.  Pitt is perfect, playing a moral man caught in an immoral world, knowing his reason for doing what he does but hating the subterfuge and betrayals more and more.  His sensitivity shines through the character.  If this film had not suffered from the camera effects and the soundtrack, I do believe it would have been a smash at the box office.  Small details rankle though.  An intro scene is supposed to be set in Washington DC but it looks exactly like London, England -- you'll find out from the OPS section that it was actually filmed in London.  Why?  The Vietnam era flashbacks are shot in an orange tint, which played well in theatres but makes them difficult to see on the small screen.  Other flashbacks, thankfully, are in normal colors. Note that Catherine McCormack does an excellent job in her small role as an aid worker caught, like the two male leads are, in a world where right and wrong are indistinct and where no one is really certain who are the good or bad guys any longer.  A very dramatic film, worth owning.
B00005T30L|5.0|This much is perfect if you're not one of those stuck up snobs too engulfed in makeup and boys to think of anything else.  Sure these girls don't really care about high school and life but it makes the film so much more interesting.  Some of the best scenes are from little side characters in the film.  Definently something to watch more than once.
B000063V8T|5.0|I have been waiting years for Paramount to release the fifth season on DVD because of the second episode- Darmok. This is classic Trek at its best. The Enterprise encounters a new species and they have to figure out how to communicate. Even though the universal translator is working fine, they make no sense to each other. This is because the aliens' speech is full of symbols referencing their own mythology, which Picard and crew don't know, of course. The problem has to be solved with thought and understanding, not engineering. I have used this episode on snowy VHS, recorded from broadcast, for college teaching in symbolic anthropology, and it will be nice to pop the DVD into my laptop and shoot it out via the data projector.

0441172717|5.0|I first read Dune at the age of 15. I never really liked fiction and I wasn't all that much of a reader. But after reading a few lines from a copy of that book, that I just happen to be holding for a friend, I knew that this was no ordinary piece of fiction. Few books, save maybe The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are comparable with it in terms of the depth and vision. In certain aspects I find Dune even greater. Many of the poems and songs composed by the fictional Gurney became my own songs. I recall them even now, 15 years after I first read them.<br />Dune is not just a piece of fiction. It is literature in its finest form. In the world of science fiction, there is nothing that can be compared to it as yet. Few writers have mastered the art of making the unreal future, as tangible and believable as Frank Herbert does in this book. My only disappointment is the fact that the sequels never live up to the promise seen in the original. Nevertheless, that fact does not in any way detract from the greatness of Dune.<br />To a fifteen-year-old mind, the impact of such vision is profound indeed. I can still smell the spice, I can still feel the dryness of the desert sand and I still believe that the dreams we remember may be visions of the future. Such is the product of great literature! Such is Dune!
B000053VAF|5.0|This review will only talk about the features included on this DVD edition.  My review of the movie proper was posted August 20, 2001. <br />---<br />Since commentary tracks are the most important feature, to me, of any DVD, and since this is my first time listening to one (well, two here) of Kevin Smith's legendary commentary tracks, let me get right at it.<br />Messrs. Smith, Affleck, Mewes, Lee, Mosier, and Pereira appear on the first track.  The Jays, Mewes and Lee, don't contribute all that much; the former adds a spaced-out comment or two, but only when prompted, giving cause for the others to ridicule his grammar; the latter only pipes up to ask director Smith a technical question once in a while.  Vinnie Pereira, who is described as View Askew's resident historian, is proven negligent on several occasions, for not knowing some detail or another.  Which, to me, proves that he's probably right most of the time, and only got called on it while the audience was in the room, for the purpose of some good-natured ridicule.  Scott Mosier, producer and second unit director, answers any and all technical questions that Smith can't, and takes some all-in-good-fun flak for his cameo in the film, a scene on the bus where he's asked to make-out with his girlfriend.  Ben Affleck, far and away the biggest star in the room, is both incredibly articulate on why he's proud of the movie and his role in it, and good-natured at being the butt of many of his lesser-known cohorts' jokes.  Kevin Smith, writer/director, is funny and forthcoming with his feelings about the movie.  He doesn't shy away from the on-set conflict between Linda Fiorentino and himself, he's outspoken about the undue criticism the film received, and he's self-deprecating when talking about his skills (or lack thereof) as a director and his reliance on toilet humour in his writings.  The track is fun and funny, like listening to a bunch of guys at a bar on a particularly witty and combative night.  It's not afraid to go off-topic (at one point a discussion breaks out on the sex-lives of the participants during the making of the movie!), but still manages to cram in more behind the scenes information than most commentary tracks I've heard.<br />The second commentary track features only Smith, Mosier, and Pereira, and was included because the first track was so jokey and off-topic at times.  Smith and Co. wanted to at least appear like real filmmakers who knew what they were doing.  So they try and talk about aspect ratios, and film stock, and optical transfers, etc.  Which is all well and good, but they also joke around enough to make this track interesting in its own right, while still being funny for non-techno geeks.<br />Besides the two commentary tracks, the 2 DVD set holds a number of other fine features.<br />Included in packages liner notes is a lengthy and finely written essay by Smith, which details how and (more importantly) why he made this film.  In it, he lays his soul bare, giving up his love for God, and his desire to honour Him (or Her) with an intelligent movie that the masses will see.  The only way to do that, he reasons, is by lacing the theologically motivated story with \\"... and fart jokes\\".  A job well done, Kev.<br />Disc two has over 100 minutes of deleted scenes that prove why they were deleted.  They are often ponderous, and would have been detrimental to the narrative, even while fleshing out each character's backstory.  The interesting part about this feature is that each scene is introduced by Pereira and an increasingly larger contingent of the Smith clan, beginning with just Kevin, then him and his daughter, then him and his daughter and his wife, and finally him and his \\"other\\" son, Jason Mewes.  It's kind of cute to see Kevin, a self-described raunchmeister, in the company of his wholesome family.<br />The outtakes section was a disappointment.  With over 3.5 hours of usable footage, you'd think the produces would have been able to cobble together more than 13 minutes of crack-ups and muggings.  But they haven't.  Pity.<br />Overall, the DVD is a fine package.  Two minor quibbles: the opening sequence, which plays while the disc loads, was funny the first time.  But it's too long.  It became annoying when every time I put the DVD in this drawn out joke had to play.  Also, when transferring between features, a short condemnation, presumably riffing on the grief the film got from the Catholic League, appears, telling the audience that they're probably going to burn for watching the movie.  I appreciate the irony, but not every time I wanted to turn the subtitles on.  This got tiresome pretty quickly, too.  But besides those two points, \\"Dogma\\" is presented in all its splendor, deservedly so.

B000056V73|2.0|The movie, basically a coming-of-age-story (for all parties involved), was so conventional it was rendered totally inoffensive (except for the painful Elton John singalong...) and palatable. <br />The real reason for those two stars is Kate Hudson's \\"performance.\\" She did little but sparkle her eyes and look slightly devious, but somehow this was enough to enchant the drooling hordes into believing she actually put any work or thought into her performance. She owes a great debt to Crowe (who is a master at creating likeable, yet shallow characters who play off all the obvious archetypes).
B00005NW02|2.0|I wanted to like it.  Really, I did.<br />It's like somebody took Crowbar, Tool, Cake, Rage Against the Machine and Primus, wadded it all up into one big ball and threw the thing against the wall.<br />This CD has it's moments, but it's as if they're just trying a little too hard to be cool, to be &quot;left of center&quot;, to be lyrically and musically clever.<br />I don't often regret buying a CD, but I really do regret this purchase.  There's better stuff out there in this genre.  If you're on the fence, don't spend your dough on this dog.  If you act fast, my copy will be on Ebay.  Bidding starts at one cent.
B000002HH9|4.0|Robert Smith has grown up nicely.  Even though it saddens me greatly that his writing shows no more signs of theatrical gloom and doom, It makes me feel a little better that he's brave enough to be able to write more grown up material and not be so scared that people will think he's sold out.  OK, so he's not writing about possesive girlfriends hanging themselves in front of him or being eaten by Spidermen anymore, but on the plus side, his lyrics have gotten a [heck of a] lot sexier.  But moving on, any decent Cure fan has got to own this.  It's got the now-classics<BR>\\"Mint Car\\", \\"Club America\\", \\"Strange Attraction\\" and \\"Want\\" on it, which I'm pretty sure are all names of Cure fansites, and are all really great songs.  Another bunch of great songs is \\"The 13th\\", which is a tasty little Latin-flavored number, \\"Jupiter Crash\\" which sounds kinda Wish-y, which is always good, \\"Sick Of It All\\" which is self explanitory, and \\"Return\\", which is very peppy, poppy and paranoid.  However, and this is unlike any other Cure album in history, there are mediocre tracks.  I'm gonna list 'em: \\"Gone!\\", \\"Round & Round\\", \\"This Is A Lie\\", \\"Bare\\"...um...and any other song I didn't mention.  But, despite the iffy tracks, you still gotta buy this CD or you're not a Cure fan.  So there.

I never knew how bad the holocaust was until I watched this movie.  It was terrible. (the war) The movie was excellent. More then excellent. it was incredible.  Everyone should see this movie. Its awesome. I even cried in it. Its a very sad movie. but its good. WATCH IT!
0393317552|5.0|Don't read this book for the lyricism of Diamond's writing.  Parts of the book, especially the late-middle portion, sound like an over-worked graduate student stayed up for a week in order to finish the text.  A smoother delivery style would have made the ideas in this book easier to digest.  (I found the writing style in &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot; to be more &quot;readable.&quot;)<br />However, what ideas!  I feel my knowledge and understanding of world history -- geology, physiology, human history, and human behavior -- was greatly enhanced by this book.  I have been thinking about human history much differently after reading the book, and you will, too.<br />I don't usually read non-fiction or natural history, but I really enjoyed this book.  Recommended for curious and open-minded readers, because your understanding will be challanged and expanded.
B000006045|5.0|Mezzanine is one of those albums you only see once every blue moon(which is actually, about every year, so how about that?). The quality of composistion and production are astounding, it almost feels as if this CD were divine.<br />Each song evokes a different tone; be it either lucidness, agression, drowsyness, hypnosis, the list goes on. Listening to Mezzanine is like staring at an expressionists painting, sureal and inviting at the same time(though not everyone will get it). The soundscapes are dense and entrapping, making the listening experience all the more enthralling. Musicianship is of top-notch caliber(even with the assistance of a DJ) and is very organic sounding for the type of music that it is. And how do you round out a package like this, you get an a-list of vocalists who lend their own styles to already indiviual songs.<br />To create very low-tempo music that is always intersting and never boring is a difficult task. One would say that this would be a great CD to fall asleep to. I say find a comfy chair, a pair of headphones(or a nice set of speakers) and let it fill the room. Trust me, you'll feel anything but sleepy.
B00005B36H|5.0|In this album, it doesn't really matter how the songs go. It rolls on and on and before you know, the CD's over already. You're getting in a trance-like situation. The best way to spend time.
B00005JKJA|3.0|If you are a David Lynch fan, or just into offbeat flicks, you will not be disappointed.<BR>HOWEVER, They chose to print this 2 hour and 27 minute film WITHOUT chapters!!!  This means that you must watch the movie at one sitting from beginning to end.  This is fine for those with lots of time on their hands.  If you are like me and can only devote an hour or so at a time to view a movie, it makes things difficult.  The movie itself if great.

There was not flash and/or hype you get in so many other artist.. You get  rich, strong and vibrant words that make you think, smike and feel warm. <br />Too many singers need hype, need flash, and this artist comes at you with her words and his instrument.
B00005Q3TZ|1.0|Watching this movie was like being lobotomized with a spoon.  A complete and total kick to the shin to any World War II veteran or Pearl Harbor survivor to have their experience reduced to puppy-dog romance and pyrotechnics.
B00005JKJA|5.0|ok... I gave 5 stars.. To the movie.. and the movie only...<BR>This DVD's not that bad... (I've seen worse) But the three problems about this DVD excluding the lack of special features are...<br /> 1. No Chapter Selection: The entire film is in one track.<BR> 2.The ... studio...digitally blured Laura Elena's vagina in the [lesbian] scene... Wich it's not that important... But it's very distracting.<BR> 3. Almost no information about Lynch or the Movie itself.<br /> One thing that I really apreciated was that Lynch included 10 clues to unlocking the thriller... Wich are very helpful( Do not read the clues untill your second viewing.<br /> But besides that... The movie is unpredictible , it looks excellent , great music... And interesting...<br /> The year's best film...
B000000W5F|5.0|'Tattoo you' is my absoulte favorite album by the Rolling Stones.I truly enjoy listening to this album, and is a must have for anyone into rock music.My personal favs include \\"Start me up\\", \\"Little T & A\\", which is Keith Richards best song, \\"No use in crying\\" and \\"Worried about you\\". In fact, the only song on the album that I'm not thrilled about is \\"Slave\\".<BR>This album is a composite album, with most of the tracks being recorded years prior to the album's release. For example, \\"Start me up\\" was cut on the same day that \\"Miss you\\" was, but was left in the vaults because the Stones liked \\"Miss you\\" more.<BR>I recomend this album to anyone who wants to get into the Stones, or anyone who already owns Stone's records.
0449227421|2.0|I did not enjoy this one as much as I did main of his other books.   I guess I did not think it grabbed me at the start like many of his works.  He always produces a decent book, and for someone who wants a book that is somewhat interesting, easy and simple, this will fit the bill.   If you are looking for something more he just did not get to that next level.   The story is an inventive one and he just about pulls it off.   I don't know why I didn't think this a real gripping boo, maybe it was just that all the work that went into it, the character development, plot, etc was just a little average and blah.     I would read this one over a Grisham or Turow, but there are also much better out there.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Led Zeppelin's put out better material than 'Presence'. <BR>The only real stand out tracks on this album are &quot;Achille's last stand&quot; and &quot;Nobody's fault but mine&quot;. There are no bad songs on this album though, it's just that the whole thing has a 'rushed' feel to it.<BR>If only Zeppelin had more time to work out the kinks in the album, then it probably would have been excellent.<BR>Most of my complaints lie in Robert Plant's vocals. He has an amazing voice, but on this album he sounds held back, which almost certainly has to do with his leg being in plaster at the time, and his not being able to stand up.<BR>'Presence' is sloppy in places too, which isn't all that bad, but things just could have been done a little cleaner with some additional time.<BR>This album is only for Zeppelin fans, or anyone interested in hearing early heavy metal, since this album has no keyboards or acousic guitars in it, and is generally heavy in grooves.
0440224764|3.0|Another one in the Grisham burn and churn machine of legal thrillers. All of his stories are about the same so I will not add to the other reviews full of the story details. I just could not believe the main story line, and for me that spelled the death of the book. I kept saying to my self - \\"yea right\\". Overall, the author continues in his long chain of McBooks and gives us something that holds your interest over TV commercials, but really does not offer a sink your teeth into story. This book is a light, easy to read and complete legal novel that will be forgotten in a few years.
0930289455|5.0|Comic books are often dismissed by many people as having no real value. They are usually looked upon as a hobby for boys and nostalgiac entertainment for men who have never really grown up. However, comic books can be and are often much more. At their best, comics can become a moving work of art and a powerful piece of literature all in one piece. Such is the case with BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE.<br />THE KILLING JOKE has become a comic classic for a variety of reasons. The book's illustrations have influenced a generation of Batman artists. The book offered insight into the Joker's personality. It changed the Batman universe (by what the Joker does to Barbara Gordon). It illustrated the strong bond between Batman and Joker and displayed the differences in world view that make the men who they are. It helped inspire a major motion picture.<br />However, the comic is much more than a story about the possible origins of the Joker and how he and Batman are so strongly bonded together. The story is a reflection of two very distinct views of life: the tragic and the comic. The Joker, ironically, views life tragically believing that all it takes is \\"one bad day\\" to transform the most normal person in the world into a psychotic maniac. His is the world of chaos and injustice. He holds onto this belief even though he knows (as the last pages of the comic show) it is false. On the other hand, there is the world view of Batman. Batman's life was changed too, by \\"one bad day\\". However, Batman's view is comic. He had one bad day, too, but it turned him into a hero. His is the world of order and justice. In the end, good triumphs over evil and the tragedians are forced to laugh at all the comedy. Life truly is beautiful. I bet you believed a comic could never be so thought-provoking.
0425170349|4.0|This book is another competent effort by Clancy.  I was excited that he was going back into the Jack Clark story line.  For me, this is one of his better characters becuase he is such a man's man.  This book probably could have done with some of the uncut pages left out, it does go on and drags a few places.   It must be the power he has gotten over this editors that each of his books that is driving them to be increasingly longer.  With that said I am a big fan of Clancy and I thought the book moves along and is never dull.  Let me add that you always get a lot of detail and fact with a Clancy book, this is one of he reasons I really like the books and the reason some of my friends are getting turned off.   The extra pages on the detail and weapons bring extra value to me.  Becuase of the believability of his role in the story, with the back ground we know about him, I completely trust the character.   This believability of the role and character are the main reason I can give this story some slack.   I was hard pressed to believe the story line at first, but through out the book you come to believe in it.   If you like Clancy you will love this book and probably do not need these reviews to prompt you to buy one.    If you are just curious then give it a try or grab one of his earlier books.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This IS the best movie of the year. Crowe gave the best performance by a male I have EVER seen, yes, that includes Tom Hanks and his awesome role in \\"Forrest Gump\\". Crowe was SOOOOO SOOOOO SOOOOO robbed in not getting the Oscar. Washington was the overrated one this year. All this he did this year was scream and yell and say 'shoot the gun, and SNORT this!!'.  CROWE DESERVED IT SO MUCH! But I digress. This movie was amazing. It's a MUST-SEE!!!!!
0440219078|5.0|The Giver was my first and only (so obviously favorite) book of Lois Lowry's. In the beginning, the world is far into the future. They have all forgotten their past and there is a srtict order of life. But one boy seems to be different from the other children. This boy sees beond what others can. He has a gift to become the next receiver of the past. It starts out as fun and games but there seems to be a lot more than that to the past. Soon he begins to see color instead of the average gray. He soon feels pain where there was none before. He even realizes some of his favorite games as a child were horrific battles in the past. He soon can't take much more and creates a plan with the Giver of information. Lois Lowry was really able to capture my imagination with this book and it remains one of my favorite of all time. And the end just keeps you guessing for more. More that I even wrote an ending for myself. This is a wonderful book thougha tad short and I recommend it to a Lowry fan or any one who likes a good fiction.
B00005R23S|5.0|WOW! What an incredible document of this record-breaking stand at New York's Madison Square Garden.  This powerhouse DVD-package includes some superb performances not contained in the HBO airings, and those alone are worth the full price of this 2-disc set. It is a MUST-OWN, for diehard fans and casual listeners alike.  To listen to the fresh interpretations of so many classic Springsteen compositions, interpolated with such strong new material, is to relive nearly 30 years of rock and roll history, for sure. But it also allows us to take a hopeful glance forward at the many treasures surely on the horizon from this once-in-a-lifetime rock legend, still making utterly thrilling music.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple plan is one of the best bands i have heard, they combine mainstream alternative rock like Blink 182, and clash with a emo core sound such as New Found Glory
B00004RFFS|1.0|This movies good if you like vampires who talk alot. Personnaly I like vampires who are'nt crybabies. Dracula would'nt feel bad if he had to suck your blood but these guys do.  They would cry for days! Whats scarey about that? If you want to see a good vampire movie go watch [another movie]. At least he does'nt ware a dumb blond wig. This has to be the boringest vampire movie ever and its hard to make boring vampire movies IMHO. Tom Cruise should stick to what he does best.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Run, don't walk, to see \\"Beauty & The Beast\\" at an IMAX near you - before it goes away and ends up in DVD this October.  A grand film of multidimensional power, this Beast will literally sweep you up and lift your spirits for days.  Who knew Robbie Benson had such a powerful voice as the Beast?  And yes, the extra scenes are fun.  More than that, however, has Disney EVER created such a 3-dimensional animated film?  NEVER.  This is one for the record books - the best Disney musical of all time!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Others may complain that the complete lack of chapter stops doesn't allow Lynch fans to skip to their favorite scenes, but think of it this way: maybe Mr. Lynch doesn't really want the couch potatoes skipping around to the sexy bits or the funny bits or even the singing bits.  Maybe he insists that you allow the film to unfold, just as you're forced to allow a dream to unfold, to follow its own logic.  Maybe in a film about losing control and confusion, he doesn't want to make it easy for you (so what else is new?).  I don't need to tell fans what a great film this is, but I'll draw attention to the little double-sided insert that comes with the DVD.  Instead of chapter titles, it gives you 10 \\"clues\\" to help you figure out the mystery.  (So there was a mystery?)  Anyhow, let me reassure first-timers, who are woefully confused and frustrated at a movie they deem incoherent and incomprehensible.  THE CLUES WON'T HELP YOU.  I'm convinced that Mr. Lynch deliberately threw out 10 red herrings as a little joke, something that seems to promise a level of control, but is ultimately just another frustration.  I can only imagine the more linear thinkers out there trying to piece everything together, trying to see the leaves, the trees and the forest simultaneously.  Forget it.  Just watch Mulholland again, and then again, and then one more time.  It just keeps getting better, but in the process opens up more and more doors, and gives us all more to think about.  The folks are crabbing about no chapter stops, but surprisingly, this stripped down, no frills arrangement makes the DVD become a MORE interactive experience than it would if it allowed us to push a bunch of buttons on our remotes.  It puts us in the psychological frame of mind that the characters experience--and provides no easy answers.  Lynch fans new and old, however, will enjoy the Talent Bios, especially the one on Mr. Lynch himself.  Exhaustive, detailed, but by no means complete, this bio is the place where all who would like to crawl inside Mr. Lynch's mind should start.
B00000G3I2|5.0|A great, charming film about adults who knew each other in previous lifetimes, &quot;The Big Chill&quot; is a tour-de-force, with tremendous performances from each of its top-notch cast members.  Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, Tom Berenger, JoBeth Williams, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum, an impossibly young Meg Tilly, Mary Kay Place - they are all fantastic.  The music percolates along, so much so that the film inspired two chart topping soundtracks, and gave rise to the renewed popularity of the classic track &quot;Ain't too Proud to Beg.&quot;  Plenty of pathos, laughter and even emotional whimsy make this a classic for the ages.
0345440900|4.0|I didn't purchase this book because it sounded very gimmicky.  After 6 months of dealing with a child that fought sleep &amp; woke several times during the night, we were at the end of our rope.  We tried &quot;Ferberizing&quot; &amp; &quot;Family Bed&quot; to no avail.  Our little one would scream at bedtime even though we could tell she was tired.  A friend lent us this book &amp; that very night she fell asleep on her own (with a little crying) &amp; slept through the night.  The next day, she fell asleep on her own with no trouble at all.  If you have a child that has sleep problems, I highly recommend this book.
B000002U8G|5.0|All I have to say is this is the best CD I own, and I own a lot of CDs.
6304578482|3.0|I hated this movie at first because it basically just seemed like a female version of \\"Dumb and Dumber\\", and while Mira Sorvino provides plenty of eye candy, as soon as she opens her mouth she reveals her monotone lack of enthusiasm and it's hard to believe in (or care about) her character.  She did such a great job in \\"Beautiful Girls\\", she made her character seem like a real person instead of an actor impersonating a character.  It seems as though she's forcing herself every step of the way to finish this movie, and she doesn't bother to interject any life or emotion into her character.  However, for all of us who endured high school while the meathead jocks and wispy cheerleaders reigned, this movie will seem like a triumph.  When it's all said and done, the people who were so happy and popular in high school end up miserable later in life, and the \\"geeks\\" like Romy and Michele ended up happily living their normal everyday lives (as is often the case...poetic justice?)  I didn't shell out any money to see this flick, so it was worthwhile to me, and if you have lingering high school lack of popularity issues, you might really enjoy this one.  The most touching part of the movie was when Romy and Michele ended up dancing with each other (when nobody else asked them) to Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\" at a school dance.
B00005UEAR|5.0|6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence is a great Album.  Every aspect of it sounds perfect.  It is something that you have to hear a few times you appreciate and love.  The music is so complex at times that its hard to understand, but after a few listens it fills your ears with something I can only describe as Perfect.  On headphones its a totally different experience with the samples and effects phasing from one side to the other.  Many times I have listened to this &quot;altered&quot; and its almost trippy.  Mike Portnoys Drumming isn't complex as SFAM but he still puts in a few &quot;what the H#ll was that&quot; in the album.
0679735909|4.0|Possession is probably the most difficult but unique book I have ever read.  A.S. Byatt is obviously very talented and much deserving of the Booker Prize.  Possession is truly a tour-de-force of many facets, although the writing style and complexity of the story may be a bit much for some.<br />Roland Michell, an academic and researcher of the 19th century poet, Randolph Henry Ash, has stumbled across something that could change the very foundation of his research: two drafts of a letter that Ash sent to a mysterious woman, who later is found to be another poet, Christabel LaMotte.  Roland enlists the help of the LaMotte scholar, Maud Bailey, to fit the puzzle pieces together.  The fact that Ash is married and LaMotte a supposed lesbian and feminist makes this journey of discovery one that will change the face of history as they've known it.  And as their research takes them further along, the mystery and suspense builds, letter by letter, until the fascinating climax at the novel's end.<br />This book, regardless of its stunning display of talent, will not be for everyone.  It took me on a roller coaster ride throughout with its high and low points as my interest in the story waxed and waned.  Interspersed with poetry, diary entries, letters, and passages from books makes Possession a very unique and creative novel; however, these things which make it unique also has the capacity to tear it down -- some of the poetry could have been left out, and the letters, albeit important to the story, were at times laborous.<br />Possession is a literature buff's dream novel.  Reader's who enjoy 19th century British literature and can actually understand poetry of that century will get more out of this novel than I did.  Throughout my reading, my rating hovered between 3 and 4 stars, but decided to round up simply for the fact that Possession is truly a novel of dynamic proportions.  It'll just take me a second read-around to understand it better.
B00005U11Z|5.0|Augeri is unbelievable, I have seen JRNY 3 times all with Augeri up front and if you can't see them live or even if you can you owe it to yourself to check this DVD and Arrival CD out. Oh yeah by the way I am not a Perry basher, I think Perry is great it's just that he is now out of Journey and they have a new lead singer, he is Former Tall Stories and Tyketto lead singer Steve Augeri is he is incredible.
B00005RFVL|5.0|...is, in fact, about 28 minutes long.  If you listen to it to the very end, there are some funny out-takes &amp; a heart-felt 'thank-you' to the extremely deserving orchestra.  Love this album.  I didn't think I'd be able to find such an addictive CD to listen to.  There aren't many out there, where every track is great and there are no songs that you want to skip through.  Love the duets.  BUY THIS CD.  You won't be sorry.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I rented this movie with very low expectations after reading the reviews.  They were wrong.  This movie left me stunned and unable to sleep afterward.  It is not for those looking for a cheap thrill and a bag of popcorn.  The story will will grab your heart and confound your senses.  If you want an \\"experience\\" instead of the usual fodder from Hollywood, this is the movie for you.  Definitely worth the admission or purchase.  Will become part of my collection.
B00003CXTG|2.0|I was hoping for a lot from this film, but I was disappointed.<br />The effects were Ok, but using modern vessels as &quot;stand ins&quot; for some scenes did not look quite right.  <br />The entire last third of the film had nothing to do with the Japanese attack, instead it concentrated on the Doolittle raid.<br />I feel that this was a pointless exercise, as it did not advance the plot, or tell anything about Pearl harbour.  I think that the Doolittle raid deserves a film in its own right, it is a classic story of WW2.<br />The film should also have concentrated on the real human drama of what happened on dec 4 1941, using actual historical characters, the USN, USMC, USAAF and US army produced many real heroes on that day.  <br />Making a film about their exploits would have been a far better tribute.
B00005NGSD|4.0|This is a very underated Scorpions album!  It's everything you want, it's got hard rock, metal, and funky Jimi Hendrix rock.  Klause really knows how to use his voice, sometimes it's laid back, sometimes agressive, and you also hear 80's metal type screams.  Ulrich Roth now (Uli Jon Roth) and Rudolf Schenker have very good riffs, for example \\"sails of chaon\\", \\"he's a woman/she's a man, \\"your light\\" etc.  Herman Rarebell and Francis Bucholz are very locked with the band.  Overall I would definantly recommend this album!!!!!
B00005JKJA|1.0|As a movie, you will either love this or hate it based on how you feel about David Lynch.  Personally, I'm a Lynch fan, so I found the movie to be funny, suspenseful, scary, sexy, and thought-provoking.<br />Now, on to the DVD itself.  No chapter menu?!?  This is completely ridiculous!  This type of movie lends itself to re-watching certain scenes to solve the mystery.  Sorry, no can do!  You'll have to watch the entire movie again or go through a tedious fast-forward search.<br />I'll give the movie four stars, but this lousy DVD gets one!
B000002NJS|5.0|It's really hard to rate the albums of someone as consistent as madonna, but if I had to I would rate this one at least as the best of the 90's. But really it ranks neck and neck with &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; as the best one she's ever done. From the opening song &quot;Drowned World/Substitute for Love&quot; to the eastern-influenced &quot;Shanti/Ashanti&quot;. Also the stand-outs such as &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Power of Goodbye&quot;. These are just to me the stand outs, the entire album is outstanding and deserves to be in any music fan collection.
B000003N7R|4.0|Always reluctant to categorize his music or accept the &quot;jazz&quot; label, Duke was at the same time highly conscious of securing his place in a history, a legacy, a tradition that he, as much as anyone, was responsible for authoring.  Through this meeting with the foremost contemporary voice in jazz, he practically assured a triumphant finishing chapter to this seminal first half of the jazz &quot;story&quot; (which would soon be temporarily disrupted first by the electronic, fusion directions the music would take, then by reactionary imitation).  Not just Duke's role but the coherent, even archetypal, tradition that Ken Burns would televise as a marathon narrative are equally served by the date--perhaps as much as by any of the numerous extended works Duke wrote to celebrate the music's history (&quot;A Drum Is a Woman,&quot; &quot;New Orleans Suite&quot;).<br />Setting the symbolism aside, Duke offers little musical substance on the occasion, deferring almost entirely to Coltrane and not even attempting to stamp his own harmonies and rhythms on the dispersed, free rhythms provided by the Elvin Jones/ Garrison team.  Coltrane's playing is superb, and in one sense a reminder of the sound of his former employer, Johnny Hodges.  In short, an album that doesn't get much playing in my collection but that represents Ellington's genius in ways not suspected even at the time of its release.  It's a reminder of Duke's extraordinary gift to the music as much as of his own unique gifts.<br />On my copy of the recording, the bassist opposite Garrison isn't John Lamb but Aaron Bell.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel was a book that will remain in my memory a long time. Garth Nix writes an incredible story with a great plot. His descriptions are so vivid that I could picture everything so well. I haven't been able to picture things in a book this well in a long time.<br />Sabriel is the daughter of a man known as the Abhorsen. When she suddenly receives mementos from her father she knows he's in trouble. She sets off into the Old Kingdom where Magic rules all.<br />Once again Garth Nix writes an incredible book in Sabriel and I hope he continues the Sabriel saga.
B00000K19E|5.0|Yes. It gets better with every viewing. I've seen it 68 times and never get tired of it. I've never watched a movie this many times and not gotten bored.
B00005JKJA|1.0|So Lynch hates to discuss the &quot;meaning&quot; of his movies, or really to discuss them at all, and I assume that means he hates things like director's commentaries, making-of featurettes, deleted scenes, promos, etc. I sort of expected all of those standard things to be missing from this DVD for that very reason. But there aren't even any chapter headings! NO CHAPTER HEADINGS! You can't start the movie from anywhere but the very beginning!<br /> I'm still trying to figure out Lynch's reasoning, because only he could have thought this was a good idea (surely the knucklehead execs wanted to give consumers chapter headings). Maybe he wanted to force viewers to watch the program all the way through from the beginning--but being able to jump forward to points within the movie is a practical convenience that should be a given for the purchase price of the DVD. For whatever reason--your DVD player gets unplugged, say--you should be able to resume watching the movie where you left off. The transfer is fine but the DVD itself is almost completely unacceptable, especially at this price. If you're gonna sell an inferior product, at least price it appropriately, and warn the consumer before purchasing.
B000005JU3|4.0|Greatest Stones anthology put on the market since Hot Rocks. Finally, a respectable single-disc collection became released that gave listeners the chance to experience assembled Bad Boy favorites more than less how they wanted. The song table provided a nice follow-up/alternative to Hot Rocks as over time and constant repeat those hits seemed to loose a bit of original spark. Were the cuts Wild Horses and Brown Sugar (already included on above) substituted by say the upbeat Hang Fire and Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker), all songs from the now OOP Rewind for example would have been covered. Maybe had She Was Hot and She's So Cold also been granted disc space, any man and his gal (or whatever your preference is) I'm sure would have had enough incentive available to sing their own perfect rendition of `I Just Want To Make Love To You`. <br />   Still, I guess, as most Stones enthusiasts are aware, You Can't Always Get What You Want. Well nothing, I guess, has an easy alternative but one I believe should be thankful there are things in life that remain desirable. After all, who could feel happy without rewards of any kind? At least with having some sort of Satisfaction, anyway. People are best off to get what they need and hope that everything else turns out for the better. And in case you're wondering, `Geez, is this some guy who thinks he has yet another solution to life's everyday problems?` My answer would be no, I don't care much for shrink freaks or any reason-strung analyst but only a Stones fan who believes Canada would be far better off had it `em Honky Tonk Women living around...
B000060P79|5.0|I saw Simple Plan open up for Sugar Ray at Penn State-Erie, the Behrend College the night their CD was released, and I LOVED THEM!  My favorite song on &quot;No Pads, No Helmets.... Just Balls&quot; would have to be &quot;Perfect.&quot;  Their first single is &quot;I'm Just A Kid.&quot;  These guys are very talented musicians and are great to see live.  They have the punk and pizazz that a lot of young bands are missing today.  They seem to be a new favorite of Sugar Ray, and Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 guest vocals on &quot;I'd Do Anything.&quot;  This album is one of the best I've heard in a long time.  I definitely think it will be one of the best of 2002!
019251010X|5.0|There is obviously something unique about a text that has survived within the canon for so many years, is continually taught to students in secondary schools and universities, and is read for entertainment by numerous people every year.  Moreover, there are even fewer texts that have generated such a legacy of being retold, replicated, and borrowed from throughout their histories.  One of these grand texts is Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.  Though one may never have read the novel or be able to recognize the author's name, it would be difficult to find a person who is not familiar with the title.  Frankenstein has evolved since its creation into one of the greatest fright stories ever and the monster has become one of epic proportion.  But, the story, in actuality, is quite different from its many replications floating around Hollywood or even those of oral tradition.  Likewise, the effect this novel has on the reader may be quite unlike what one initially presumes.  This was my case in reading the infamous tale for the first time this year.<br />To begin, the language of Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is, like many novels of its time, challenging.  This should not, however, be considered a hindering aspect of the novel.  Actually, the language of the narrative aids in the reading for Shelley uses the text as a tool to present an argument.  The formality of the language is necessary in order to articulate such a position while demanding attention from the reader to evaluate that posture.  Along with this, there are several instances that illustrate the desired position of the author.  Without the elevated language, these small details would certainly be lost or overlooked.  Through such clarity, one is forced to accept the seriousness of the ideas presented within the text, which are often disregarded in modern film or oral interpretations.<br />Another particularly impressive aspect of Frankenstein is the development of the story in entirety; it is here that Shelley's genius is obvious.  First, the tale is appropriately established within a darkened atmosphere; this created world places the reader in the proper frame of mind to begin such a tale while allowing the author to skip over mundane details that would obstruct from the reader's enjoyment.  Throughout the novel, one can depend on Shelley to move the reader through the plot by her creation of the atmosphere.  Second, as the story focuses around the nature of the human, Shelley develops her protagonist accordingly and with eloquence.  The author does an outstanding job of balancing grandness with reality.  Dr. Victor Frankenstein is a man who is greater than life while epitomizing all human beings.  That is, he is a genuinely good man who makes a grand mistake.  Throughout the story, one is able to relate to the doctor as a fictional character and as a representative figure of all humankind.<br />Finally, the action of the story is probably the best known aspect of the tale and is much deserving of that recognition.  The plot shares many of the characteristics discussed regarding the development of the protagonist.  While the action is something grand, it is created in a way that seems applicable to all human experiences.  On the other hand, it is for this reason that the actual plot seems less important than the underlying presuppositions which Shelley is presenting through her narrative.  That is, there are certain universal truths that ought not be violated.  There is an ultimate good within the world that is both universal and eternal and the violation of this will always lead to the destruction of the person.  Obviously, there is a deep religiosity flowing throughout Shelley's narrative.<br />In short, all the elements of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein illustrate reasons that explain the success of the tale.

0967851408|5.0|I finished reading this gem of a book a couple weeks ago and I began practicing the meditations scrupulously. I am now experiencing several positive changes in my life. The changes are too personal for me to write about. However, all I can say is I'm indeed blessed to have found the &quot;one&quot; good self help book that I had been looking for, all my life. <BR>It is just not good enough just thinking positively, you have to think positively with FEELING. And, the only way to do that is by disciplined everyday meditation for atleast fifteen to twenty  minutes without fail. The more you practice the more magnetic you become, to attract whatever you want in life.<BR>Buy and read this gem, it will tell you how! <BR>Also read &quot;The Abundance Book by John Randolph Price&quot;

B00005QK3W|5.0|I love Paul McCartney. I love what he does. Right now I am listening to the song &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; and I am just dumbfounded how people think that this man is not talented. He has a certain way about him that is very subtle, and I love that. He also knows how to have fun. There doesn't always need to be a reason for something, not everything has to have an intellectual feel about it, or serious. Paul is really not blatant with his writing, and that adds to him musically. McCartney has a different intellectual feel that is just fun a lot of the time. No he's not John Lennon, he's not George Harrison, he's not Richard Starkey, but who cares, he's Paul McCartney. And he's a good songwriter and bass player.<BR>That's what was so great about the Beatles. They were four different people, and it showed so well. Everyone of their songs had a different feel for which ever person wrote it. It shows very well on the few songs that Lennon and McCartney both wrote the lyrics together.<BR>This is a pretty good album that holds some real good songs. End of discussion.<BR>I'm glad that the music world has Paul McCartney, I know that it wouldn't be the same if he wasn't.

0425074811|1.0|It amazes me that anyone can take this book seriously, much less consider it a way to open one's mind. It amazes me that this book is still in print. It amazes me that von Daniken is still writing. <br />Highlights for this book: first off, von Daniken exhibits all the typical behavior of Martin Gardner's &quot;hermit scientist&quot; -- long on speculation, short on proof. Second, mentioning people like Edward Cayce favorably. Third, an undercurrent of racism inherent to much literature of this type (&quot;of course zey could not haff made zese; zey are not European!&quot;). On top of all that, the edition I have would appear to be a fairly bad translation of a ridiculous book, making it perfect reading for those late-night toke'n'Twinkie sessions. <br />Get this used. It's not worth the price of buying new. I got mine for a quarter at a library discard sale, and since I don't smoke pot...
B00005JKQX|1.0|or Honey, I shrunk the Oscars ! <br />Do you remember when Russell Crowe was the best kept secret in Hollywood ? Do you remember that you have been secretly in love with Jennifer Connelly for the last 15 years ? What have Ron Howard done to them ?<BR>The life of John Forbes Nash math genius and Nobel Prize gives Ron Howard the opportunity to deal again with the American positive values all of his movies (except maybe Ransom)are swimming in. So here we go again with the usual promotion of an \\"Extraordinary Destiny of A Beautiful Mind\\" that is supposed to wipe out all of the American doubts (yes they exist !). The life of John Forbes Nash could have been a paranoid tale and an allegoria of the life in America during Cold War and Mac Carthy. But no!, all those spies were just an allusion and after a small brain cleaning all is back in order !! And we can witness one of the scariest dialogue of the last 20 years (\\"Mac Carthy is stupid but he is not always wrong !\\")<br />Russel Crowe plays Nash from 1947 to 1994, from Princeton university to the Nobel Prize in 1994. Crowe's performance is absolutely dreadful and utterly ridiculous : he overplays the genius with a catastrophic plethora of mouth twistings and eyes clinchings. It's \\"Rain Man for Dummies\\" !It makes the overplaying of Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man almost as sober as a Bergman movie. <BR>I cannot say anything about J-Co except that I am in love with her and seeing her with that awful \\"planet of the apes\\" make-up in the end almost killed me. <BR>The screenplay is so overwhelmed with good feelings and happy ending that it almost makes that real story fake. The directing is absolutely flat (Ron howard winning over David Lynch and Robert Altman is one of the funniest situations the oscar witnessed !) and over sentimental. <br />But Of course it won the Best Picture Oscar. Against an Kiwi and an Aussie, can we think that we witness a patriotic vote on Oscar Night ??? <br />Don't lose your time with this cold meat andgo and buy the Mulholland Drive DVD !!!!!!!!!!!
630575067X|4.0|I just watched the The Phantom Menace again on video, not having seen it since it was out in theaters, and had a few thoughts to share with my fellow Amazon.com customers.<br />- The first hour or so is WAY too fast-paced. I realize Lucas is making what is basically an action-adventure film here, and that he doesn't want to lose the attention of the adolescent and pre-adolescent males that are his target audience, but JEEZ! It's really hard to follow what's going on without liberal use of the \\"Rewind\\" button - an option I didn't have upon first viewing. It's also a shame in that Lucas has assembled such a fine cast (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, etc.) and allows them so little breathing room.<br />- As a screenwriter, Lucas makes a wonderful director. Watching TPM, I was reminded of Harrison Ford's remark during the filming of the first SW film: \\"George, you can type this stuff, but you sure as hell can't say it\\". If I heard one more person shout \\"Yippie!\\", I was gonna strangle somebody.<br />- I noticed that the very last thing you hear on the soundtrack (at the end of the credits) is Darth Vader's breathing. Nice touch.<br />I WOULD recommend this to all my fellow SW fans out there, but y'all have probably seen it a couple dozen times anyway. Let me just say, then, that despite its flaws, TPM was still one of the best SF films of the 90s. I can't wait for the next two films to come out. Let's just hope Lucas slows things down a bit for them.
0451450523|5.0|'The Last Unicorn' is one of the greatest fantasy books of the last century. Of course the movie attracted me to it first. I think I was 12 when I finally realized that there was a book that came first and, like always, the book was better. It has been said that Peter S Beagle once despaired of writing this book because everyone kept writing to him about a sequel. It is currently his biggest seller.<BR>This book has it all: a plot that is well-developed, characters that grow as the book progresses and feel very real to the reader, and the book is extremely well-written. Beagle knows his imagry and is one of the best at spinning a good tale. <BR>In this reviewer's opinion, every writer has one great book that comes off their pen. One book that makes the reader scream for more or makes them need to read it again and again. If this was not Beagle's great book, then he has something truly soul-shattering to write because 'The Last Unicorn' stole my heart long ago.
B00005LQ04|3.0|Most people usually claim this as Argento's greatest work and if one understands the contruct in which he works, Suspiria is basically mission accomplished. Part mystery, part hallucinigenic trip, Suspiria really has no point other than to create a dark and nonsensical atmosphere and give the audience a front seat into this macabre look at witches. When I first saw this film around 15 years ago, I didn't appreciate it as much as I do now that I bought the 3 disc set. Now that I think about it, Suspiria was probably one of the great COLLABORATIVE efforts in horror film to be ranked up there with DOTD. Basically, if you take away any of the aspects of the film...something is lost. Try watching it with no volume and you will see what I mean.
B000002J1U|5.0|III shows helps to show how much Zepplin was able to do. This album provides acoustic songs like Immigrant Song and Gallows pool. There are more blues oriented songs on this album like Since I've been loving you. <br />Overall, listen to this album if you want to hear more than just Led Zepplin's hard rock sound.
B0000507PC|4.0|Could be that I was a little harsh on the title but I was thinking of the scene in which the hero falls in love with the heroine who was so wishy-washy over the young war pilot that it made me sorta, well, ill.  The doctor's performance is extraordinary (as usual) and the nurses are superb.  The children add a definite charm and give the movie substance.  As I watched the movie, I became quite involved with the story and found myself rewinding some parts to simply enjoy a scene again.  The actual Cider House Rules are a bit off-beat and really don't play much into the story but the story itself is surprising and wonderfully portrayed by the actors.  I really liked this movie.
0684859106|4.0|I've made several recipes out of my Magnolia Bakery Cookbook and I'd say that I was happy with about half of them.  I honestly think that is pretty good odds for a cookbook though. It all comes down to opinion, because some of the recipes that I've not cared for, other people have absolutely loved the results. I'm really attracted to the book's presentation - I think that it looks lovely. I also purchased the Buttercup Bakery cookbook and find that one to be about the same quality.  As for the Magnolia cookbook, I think that it is a bit expensive for the size of it but I collect baking cookbooks and I wanted this one to add to my collection no matter what the price.  I think it makes an attractive gift and I think that it's fine for baking beginners.  The recipes are simple and made with basic ingredients.   Plus, it's different than those massively printed cookbooks that everyone owns - that's a nice change.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I believe you have to listen to this cd many multiple times to truly appreciate it, but once you do it is well worth it.  It is definetely subtle but the great part about it is how it resonates with you afterwards.  You find yourself humming her songs even when you are not thinking of the cd.  Everyone should have this for when they finish a hard day at work at need to calm their nerves.
B00002E285|2.0|Those who think books like Jack Kerouac's \\"On the Road\\" and movies like \\"The Crow\\" actually have something to say about their respective 'generations' will probably like the film version of \\"The Wall,\\" as well, and laud it just as highly.  For me, though, the movie is a soulless, emotionally sterile, and bombastic 90-minute music video that's nowhere near as affecting as the album that inspired it.  Okay, so a little boy's father dies in a war.  He has fantasies about being a rock star and, wouldn't you know it, grows up to be a Hitler-esque dictator...or something.  The subtle humor from the album is gone, instead replaced with super-literal interpretations of the songs.  \\"The Wall\\" will remain popular, I think, only as an oddity in the annals of pretentious filmmaking.

B000001IPL|5.0|For all of you that simply were in love in Americana and Conspiracy of the One this album is not quit for you because this album is much less popy and not baby-punk. I did enjoy the new album's but we can see that they are made for money not for music.\\"Self-esteem\\" is probably their best songs on this album and Have you ever is also quite good. It is sad that Offspring went over to the baby-punk genre even in this album there is a bit of baby-punk because after Smash The Offspring went downhill<BR>in the quality of their music so you must by this album
B00004T1NA|4.0|Continuing where Stupid Dream left off, Lightbulb Sun is a fine album.  Lead singer and guitarist Steven Wilson dominates the songwriting and sound of this album with his Pink Floyd inspired guitar lines constructing a sonically beautiful album.  The rest of the band is superb and the production is excellent.  Lightbulb Sun is perhaps Porcupine Tree's most mature work to date.  And while the band sounds, at times, like a throwback to the 70's art-rock and psychedelia, the music sounds fresh and is nothing short of genius.
B00004W510|5.0|The brown album is one of the quintessential pieces of music made during the rock era.  It is a study in underplaying and doesn't evoke the same pretentious feeling that most records from the same time do. In doing this, these four Canadians and one American managed to create the classic American album.  <BR>It is almost impossible to define or categorize this record.  It is not exactly country, it isn't really blues, not particularly dixieland, nor is it predominately rock music.  It is, in fact, a stew of all these influences, with various other \\"old-timey\\" type genres thrown in the pot.  It is the music of The Band, a category unto itself.<br />     \\"The Band\\" is one of the few records that I can listen to all the way through, there is not one cut that isn't wonderful.<br />      The record begins with \\"Across The Great Divide\\", sung by Richard Manuel.  The song is a glorious opener complete with The Band horn section, and Manuel's trademark triplet piano playing.<BR>\\"Rag Mama Rag\\", a raucious dixieland style send up with some tongue-in-cheek lyrics, is another classic.  The whole album is loaded with classics.  \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\\", which unfortunately most people know from the terrible Joan Baez version, is heartbreaking tale of a confederate soldier, sung convincingly by Levon, the lone American in the group.  \\"Up on Cripple Creek\\" is a terrific piece of hillbilly-funk and was a hit here in 1969.  The thing that makes The Band what they are is the musical interplay between each member. The bass player and the drummer feed off each other like few do.  The create this bottom end that can be as funky as James Brown or as stately as church music.  Robertson's shrilling guitar is the ultimate in understatment, but he manages to squeeze out more emotion in those four notes than most musicians could in a thousand.  Manuel is THE voice, he has one of the most delicate and heartfelt voices I have ever heard in rock music.  The secret weapon, as Robertson puts it, is Garth Hudson the keyboard player.  The man does things with organs that are unholy!<br />The rest of the record is unforgettable too. From the heartbreaking hymn \\"Unfaithful Servant\\" to the rocking \\"Look Out Cleavland\\" each cut is golden.  If you want to see what i mean about the bass-and-drum interplay, you need only listen to \\"King Harvest\\"....amazing.  <br />This album is a must have for anyone who considers themselves a music lover, absolutely essential.
B000002J29|5.0|Seconds Out is a nearly flawless live album essential to Genesis fans.  Its a powerful live performance and it showcases both Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel era songs performed with Phil at the helm.<br />Throughout the 70's, progressive rock bands released quite a few live albums but most fell well short of expectations or potential.  Emerson, Lake and Palmer released \\"Welcome Back My Friends...\\" which was so long, it was almost impossible to digest.  Yes released \\"Yessongs\\" and Rush released \\"All The World's A Stage\\" but they suffered from mediocre production.  Genesis had even released \\"Genesis Live\\" but, while a strong release, it was comprised of only a handful of songs.  Seconds Out combined strong material, an excellent performance, and incredible production to produce their strongest live album and one of the best live progressive rock releases.<br />While the tone of some of the older Gabriel-era songs is slightly different with Collins taking lead vocal duties, he does an admirable job.  There is perhaps more emotional punch in the Seconds Out versions of Supper's Ready and Cinema Show than was originally delivered by Gabriel on the studio versions.  The Collins-era material shines as well with the exception of Squonk which sounds slightly flat.<br />Seconds Out also marks the last Genesis release with Steve Hackett who left the band during the mixing of this set complaining that his guitar work was lost in the mix.  While this is true to a certain degree, Hackett shines on this release.  Collins, along with relief drummer Chester Thompson, plays powerfully, showcasing his percussion skills.  Tony Banks does a masterful job on keyboards and Mike Rutherford dazzles on bass.<br />Seconds Out is an excellent live album and an intriguing chapter in the history of the band.  It's definitely an album not to be missed.
B00001ZULV|4.0|Turn It On Again:  The Hits is essentially a collection of the songs that brought Genesis to the forefront of pop music.  While these songs are all quite good, this collection doesn't exhibit Genesis' best work.  For the most part, behind every song that made it to the radio or on a single, Genesis had an album's worth of arguably better (although less commercially appealing) songs.  It makes sense that a collection like this should contain the most popular songs but a few less commercial songs could have been sprinkled in here and there to help introduce people to the band.  Regardless, the real selling point here is the new version of Carpet Crawlers featuring Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford and Steve Hackett.  It's definitely worth the price of the collection.
6303168507|5.0|Of course, Schindler's List is a classic. And yes, Steven Spielberg is one of our most important directors. But what Spielberg has achieved in this movie towers above anything he has ever done....he has taken a true story, one of powerful emotion, and fabricated a legacy for all people to remember.<br />This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen before. Despite Spielberg's use of gritty B&W, which makes the viewer focus completely on the story, there are shots so powerful and intense that you scarcely notice. Scenes that play over and over in my head include the little girl running through the Warsaw ghetto during the liquidation of the Jews; concentration camp women pricking their fingers and rubbing blood into their cheeks in an attempt to appear healthier, and thus less apt to be sent to the gas chambers; and most of all, entering Auschwitz, replete with Nazi guards, barking dogs, and a slow pan upward to the giant brick chimney, belching smoke and flame into the night. Knowing the fuel of that fire makes it that much more monstrous.<br />Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley tower over all in their respective lead roles, but Spielberg's use of little known actors in key roles succeeds beautifully. I imagine the emotional level during shooting was extremely high, and it shows in the performances.<br />This movie will grow in importance as time passes, not only for its technical genius, but also for presenting the viewer with as vivd a reminder of man's inhumanity to man as one could ever hope for. When I attended this movie in the theater, there was an intermission, at which point most of the patrons talked and smoked together. But at the film's conclusion, everyone simply filed out of the theater in silence. Nobody spoke a word. The film had spoken many volumes for us all.
B00000255F|5.0|A revelation takes place about one minute and twelve seconds into Born To Run's (1975) opening track, \\"Thunder Road.\\" You'll realize that this is a brand new Bruce Springsteen musical trip, resplendent with a forceful band, toned and buff in Phil Spector's Wall of Sound. Thirty seconds later, even the hardest and most skeptical hearts would start beating again as the E Street Band muscles its way into your consciousness. It's a magnetic field, a rock & roll powerhouse that blows you away recklessly, just before pulling you right back in again.<br />And that is the irony of emotion, and of being in love, Springsteen supposes. It's a catharsis that is not about the arrival, but the journey. From title track \\"Born To Run\\":<br />\\"Together, Wendy, we can live with the sadness/<br />I'll love you with all the madness in my soul.\\"<br />By the end of \\"Thunder Road,\\" four minutes and forty-five seconds into the record, you'll know that Jon Landau was right when he wrote in Boston's Real Press: \\"I have seen the future of rock & roll, and his name is Bruce Springsteen.\\" By the time the tramps in \\"Born To Run\\" make it out of their dead end town, you start to believe in a new hero for the ages. Could this rock & roll resuscitation be the revival of the American Dream?<br />The concepts that Springsteen explores in this record aren't strange sensations. To anybody who has a heart, love, the loss of love, tragedy, triumph, hope, fear, rebellion, and desperation are familiar companions, much more familiar in the darkness when there's nothing standing in between and no truth or consequence to confront. Feeling for their way, Springsteen's heroes are looking for some type of redemption - any form of redemption - in each other, perhaps. In \\"Backstreets,\\" the two lovers are \\"slow dancing in the dark/On the beach at Stockton's Wing/Where desperate lovers park.\\" When their energy is spent, they're \\"laying here in the dark/You're like an angel on my chest/Just another tramp of hearts/Crying tears of faithlessness.\\" From \\"Night\\":<br />\\"And you know she will be waiting there/<br />And you'll find her somehow, you swear/<br />Somewhere tonight/<br />You run sad and free/<br />Until all you can see is the night.\\"<br />It's this type of poetry, and the anthemic musical compositions that back it up, that attest to the authenticity of these emotions, and possibly what made this record commercially successful. It's hard to talk about this landmark album without \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"Born To Run,\\" because they are Springsteen's bread and butter, the songs that make and break the type of musician he really is, and perhaps his existence as one. These songs are so good, so powerful that it makes stellar productions like \\"She's The One\\" and \\"Meeting Across The River\\" seem like filler tracks. With \\"Thunder Road,\\" the dreamer starts out patient, softly persuading his girlfriend Mary to take off with him from her back porch:<br />\\"Well now I'm no hero, that's understood/<br />All the redemption I can offer, girl/<br />Is beneath this dirty hood/<br />With a chance to make it good somehow/<br />Baby, what else can we do now?\\"<br />If you came from a town littered with \\"skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets,\\" you could feel Springsteen's pain. If you didn't, you desperately wished you knew how sweet flight could be. But everyone is familiar with this romance, and you know this love story.<br />\\"It's a town full of losers/<br />And I'm pulling out of here to win.\\"<br />Can anyone with a dream really argue with this \\"Born To Run\\" philosophy, so logical that it doesn't deserve an explanation?<br />\\"In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American Dream...<br />Baby, this town rips the bones from your back/<br />It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap/<br />We gotta get out while we're young/<br />'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run.\\"<br />By this time, the middle of the track, there's no turning back, either for Springsteen or for you, the listener... on this record, you're busting down the highway to redeem a new soul at the end of it.<br />Subtlety is not Springsteen's true calling, but he just might have undone himself this time - \\"Backstreets\\" is the underachieving purgatory lurking in the shadows, the story of two tormented lovers, twisting in a catharsis of emotion as heightened as the intro's pounding crescendo.<br />\\"Blame it on the lies that killed us/<br />Blame it on the truth that ran us down...<br />When the breakdown hit at midnight/<br />There was nothing left to say/<br />But I hated him/<br />And I hated you when you went away.\\"<br />Springsteen tries to re-create the Roy Orbison sound on songs like \\"Thunder Road,\\" but on \\"Backstreets,\\" the vocals are bona fide Bruce. The tortured wail at the end is a desperate cry for \\"a love so hard and filled with defeat.\\"<br />Which makes the musical bridge of closing opus \\"Jungleland\\" such an antidote to all that Springsteen has put us through in the record. Nothing feels and sounds better than the Big Man honking a solo sax, stark and slicing through the imagined night, Roy Bittan stroking the ivories. This is when you begin appreciating how well the E Street Band plays together, the sensation from each musician's instrument rising to the occasion and complementing each other. It's like an orchestra that falls into place because everyone feels it... no baton necessary.<br />It's hard to believe that this is the shortest Springsteen album so far. Just under forty minutes, it seems like it took a lifetime of emotions to get to the end. You're spent, worn out by this... rollicking rock & roll.

B0000024ZT|4.0|When people first heard Bruce Springsteen's 1973 \\"Greetings From Asbury Park, N.J.,\\" they said that he was the next Bob Dylan. But, with all due respect to Bob, that would be too simple. I can see what they were trying to say, though. Each song was a saga bursting with words. Springsteen, on this record, has always been guilty of trying to fit too many words into each bar of music. (Check out these lines from his opening song, and one of the more well known tunes from Springsteen's early days, \\"Blinded By The Light\\":<br />\\"Go-cart Mozart was checking out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside/<BR>Little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride/<BR>Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playing backyard bombardier.\\"<br />His redemption is that the stories he told needed every single one of the words he chose for his sagas. One word less, and they would be choking for breath.<br />Early and first-time listeners of this record didn't really know that two years later, they wouldn't be hearing this folk-rock Springsteen sound again till about 20 years later. If they had known, they would have paid more attention. \\"Greetings\\" was a commercial failure, despite a relatively above-average critical response. It's a difficult record to get into - much easier if you were already a Springsteen fan weaned on Born To Run (1975) and Born In The USA (1984), although the fact that only Garry Tallent and Clarence Clemmons from the now permanent E Street Band play here may be somewhat of a damper, too (what, no Little Steven? No Mighty Max?). It's difficult for the reasons stated earlier - when you have what's amounted to a song poem of Chaucer proportions set against minute musical maneuvers, where does your attention go? It's just too much for a good time rock tune. Without patience, this record may be lost on the most saintly of rock fans.<br />While the faster tunes - \\"Does This Bus Stop At 82nd Street\\" & \\"For You\\" and the aforementioned\\"Blinded By The Light\\" - are jammy numbers with a tight sound grounded, but not inhibited by, garage band roots, Springsteen's soul in the early 1970s are better manifested through the ballads (\\"Mary Queen Of Arkansas\\", \\"The Angel\\", and \\"Lost In The Flood\\"). Bruce has never sounded so poignant, so lost - yet you get the feeling that he's found his emotion through this music. From \\"Mary Queen Of Arkansas\\":<br />\\"I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade/<BR>I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state.\\"<br />The singing and the wail of the harmonica are as tormented as the words. Although Springsteen would later produce more stories of defeat and gloom (\\"Thunder Road\\", \\"The River\\"), these early ones aren't protected by a surer, steadier hand at the production panel and a more mature musicianship.<br />Which leads me to feel that this record was Springsteen's Purgatory. To play a heavenly blues guitar, you need to first cleanse your soul, by selling it to the devil. To launch into that type of rock & roll that makes you walk on air, you need to come to terms with the angst. Bear it, share it, and let the force of it propel you into musical proportions you've never known before. In later works, you feel like you're sitting next to Springsteen in the front of a pick-up as he takes you along on his rock & roll road trip. On \\"Greetings\\", - you're in the next car peering in at the car rolling slowly down the dirt road, the driver's hand gripping the steering wheel tight, tears at the corners of his eyes. When the record closes with \\"It's Hard To Be A Saint In The City,\\" you already know that in Springsteen's world, it's hard to be a saint anywhere.<br />\\"The devil appeared like Jesus through the steam in the street/<BR>Showin' me a hand I knew even the cops couldn't beat/<BR>I felt his hot breath on my neck as I dove into the heat/<BR>It's so hard to be a saint when you're just a boy out on the street.\\"<br />In so many ways,the picture of a skinny Springsteen grinning like a monkey on the back of the record is really apt. Not yet beefed up like the Boss days of the 1980s, no emotional trauma from divorce, Springsteen is almost like a happy-go-lucky troubadour who got caught in troubled waters ever so often - the music is sparingly simple when compared to the Wall of Sound effects on Born To Run. At the time of this record's release, Bruce Springsteen had not yet met Jon Landau, and Landau had not yet heard or seen Springsteen play. Thus, the \\"future of rock & roll\\" would not yet be discovered, although his legacy would have already begun.
B00005JKT8|5.0|Kate and Leopold is a comic and romantic film that circles around the lives of two individuals from two different time zones.  Kate McKay, portrayed by celebrated film leading lady, Meg Ryan, is a topnotch business executive in New York.  As an achiever, she focuses on reaching the highest rank within the company she is working at sacrificing love.  At a time when she is geared towards success, she meets a dashing debonaire from a past era.  Leopold, played by up and coming Australian lead actors, Hugh Jackman.  Leopold transcends to the present time through his accidental encounter with a man from the present who happens to be, Kate McKay's former boyfriend.  <br />After the complicated yet seemingly legitimate process of time travel, Kate and Leopold meets in New York.  They hated each other considering the vast difference in their culture and upbringing.  Imagine, a knight in shining armor from the 18th century in the same side of the world with a controlling woman of the new millenium.  The ultimate clash of civilizations.<br />The film succeeds in portraying love as the power of all powers.  Time helps two hearts find the love they have been wanting for life.   Love in turn becomes the reason for them to meet at the same time and place in life.<br />It's a feel-good movie that makes one wish that its events are true and realistic.  Ryan will charm you with her unbelievable presence behind the white screen.  Jackman will entice you with his remarkable talent and melting smile. It's worth the money.
B0000029DD|5.0|Earth shattering, soul moving, haunting, deep, this is a must have, it is moving, in the top ten best CD's of all time,without a doubt.
B00005BCPC|1.0|This was a horrible adaptation of Jane Austin's novel.  I was very disappointed and could not recommend it to any of my friends.  The whole slavery issue and the pictures depicting the lewd treatment of them was very shocking and had no business being in this movie.  I hope that someone else will make a Mansfield Park movie that is truer to the book!!!!!
0385335482|4.0|I rather identified with the book, even though nowadays I can (thankfully!) afford it more or less...<br />I'd like to start with what I DIDN'T like about this book. This seems to be just another one of those 'British Girls' books like Bridget Jones, etc. that seem to be flooding the book market lately. All of them are centered around a 30 year old (give or take a few years), her love life, and often something extra (weight in Bridget's case, money in Rebbeca's, etc), their collection of friends / foes (which is amazingly similar...) and all their problems are magically solved when they get together with the 'Perfect Guy' (the same guy they despised in the beginning of the book, but throughout it discover their attraction and beging a love / hate relationship with him up until the happy ending...), preferably after some great sex...<br />Although I really didn't like Bridget Jones's story (probably because I couldn't identify with someone so desperate), I took a chance and read it, after the clerk in the book store reccomended it as a very funny book... Which it is - I still smile when I remember Rebbecca's curry, or her museum visit...<br />The bottom line is that this is an ordinary but very funny book.
038533348X|4.0|A great satire of the cold war, american life, and banana republics, as well as religion and other sacred cows.  Bokonon rules!  This book is a great way to introduce yourself to Vonnegut.
B00005JKQX|5.0|It took me awhile to actually get to a theatre to watch this movie, and when I finally did, I couldn't remember why I had waited so long.  I am a huge Russell Crowe fan, as well as a Jennifer Connolly fan, and I was very pleased to see her star in a film side-by-side this amazing actor.  Crowe's performance in portraying John Nash was absolutely unbeatable and I was so absorbed in this movie that when it was over I just wanted to sit in my chair and cry for all those who suffer from mental illness.  Crowe was truly robbed of the oscar by yet another ridiculous political statement.  He is best actor in my book.  See this movie, if you haven't already!!!  It is an experience you won't forget!
0517122707|5.0|This book came to my by way of my sister who hates to read, but said that it was really funny.  In this case, she was right.  It was a hilarious book, with unlikely characters.  I wish there were more books like it.
B00004T9UF|4.0|I got this cd right after it came out, but after some time of not really listening too much to it, I put it in the cd changer in my car.  Now it is all I listen to.  The rhymes are witty fresh and match the beats perfectly.  I like the way he can come across as this sarcastic full-of-[stuff] type of kid but sound totally convincing as well.  You never quite know if the joke is on him, or if the joke is on you.  No matter what, this album showcases Em's talent on the mic.
6305399212|5.0|I'm not going to say its like watching a whole new movie but its definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the Alien(s) films at all.  I remember seeing broadcasts of Aliens years ago with at least some of the extra footage and being amazed.  I didn't see it again until I got the tape.  And there are extras I didn't see at all.  They're signifcant and make for great viewing.  Aliens Special Edition is definitely a cut above Aliens which, I personally consider, the best of the series.
B000002NIW|5.0|The Deftones tear it up all over this CD. From the first song \\"My Own Summer\\" to the mosh pit anthem \\"Head Up\\", they show us how rock is supposed to be. The originators of rap/rock fusion teach us a audio lesson all over again. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ROCK FAN!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I can see why someone wouldn't like Moulin Rouge. It could be a visual overload for someone who isn't prepared or doesn't like that kind of thing. Some poeple aren't willing to suspend their disbelief. The key to enjoying Moulin Rouge is to understand that none of it is supposed to be real. It takes place in a Paris heightened by the imagination and a love for the city; nothing looks that good all over in real life. That doesn't mean you shouldn't care about the characters; it just means that you shouldn't expect them to seem 'normal.'                  <BR>   I, personally, love it. Baz Luhrmann would be my god if he wasn't so silly (I've seen that behind the scenes footage). The performances are fabulous; the voices, while they aren't professional caliber, are perfect for the roles. It's beautiful to look at; it's got a story that, while not bringing anything new, breathes affecting, moving, passionate life into old material. I cry almost every time I see it (about eight now) and I am not a crying person. On top of all that, it's funny.<BR>    This DVD is a wonderful way to extend one's experience of the film. It brings some fabulous innovations, such as the Red Curtain feature--you turn it on, and once in a while a green fairy appears. You click, and it takes you behind the scenes, showing you how they did it. I still haven't finished exploring all the other great stuff they've got.<BR>     Wheeee!
B00005JKED|5.0|There are many cop movies being made every year, but most of them just involved the good cop busting every bad guys and there is always a happy ending. It is hard to find a cop movie which gives me the impact like training day. In the movies we see cops as heros who always win in the end and given recognitions. But after watching Training Day, I learnt that being a good cop might be harder than we all think. This movie shows us that being a cop, you have to deal with temptations like sex, drugs and money. Denzel's superb acting will keep you glued to the sofa throughout the movie while you are watching at home. It is simply one of the best cop movies I've ever seen...
B00005JKHP|4.0|After watching this new Director's Edition, I have to say I'm shocked! This was the film that should have been released in 1979! Having read some of the Amazon reviews, I was prepared for a tauter and more exciting version of ST:TMP, though reviews do conflict. For my own experience, I can't believe how much better this release is. You haven't truly seen The Motion Picture until you've seen this DVD.<br />This Edition is a lesson to the film-going public of how important editing is. The choices made by Bob Wise return the movie to the pace set in the original series. In fact, after Spock's mind meld, the film recaptures the camaraderie and feel of the series at its best. True, the beginning of the film is still necessarily stretched by the need to bring all the characters back together, and this is probably where less patient people lose interest.<br />In this Edition, we actually get to see the whole V'GER. But none of the new effects is the reason for buying this DVD. It is for the story and the way it's told. In 1979, as an adolescent, I was bitterly disappointed that the story Roddenberry chose was a composite of several successful episodes. I wondered why I bothered to make it out on December 7th. Now I can see what those men and women had in mind, and instead of being an amalgamation, this movie is the quintessential representation of what Star Trek, the idea and the global phenomenon, was about. (Now it's about money.)<br />I (re-)learned how funny this movie is, how touching, how intellectually and emotionally stimulating. The new effects, most of which were conceptualized for the original release but left out due to lack of budget and time, certainly do add a stamp of authority. Wait till you see how the principals walk out to meet V'GER! Cool!<br />My only complaint is that at times the video quality is absolutely awful, as in the planet Vulcan scene. On my 65\\" rear-projection TV, the graininess and washed out colors are practically an insult. For this reason, I rate this DVD at only 4 stars. <br />I want to thank the team that worked on the Director's Edition, as well as those who worked on the original release. Finally, after 22 years, the hype matches the results. How different the succeeding movies might have been had this one been the unequivocal success it is now.
0446310786|4.0|I think that this was an interersting novel. When I first read this book I thought It was boring. It was like a true story because things like that happen. All the characters in the story<BR>were described well. Throughout the story, I was really into <BR>certain chapters. What really grabbed my attention was the movie.<BR>I saw the movie abut two months ago. I really enjoyed it even though it was different from the book.  My favorite characters were Jem and Scout, they were brave childern.  Besides that the conclusion was not so bad.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|I've known Howard Shore as a composer for dark scores -such as &quot;The Fly&quot;, &quot;The Silence Of The Lambs&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot; -and, even though he has also written music for light comedies, I was extremely impressed at hearing his composition for Peter Jakcson's tribute to J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring&quot;.  In fact, I think this is the best film score of 2001 since this gives me the chance of hearing Shore's wide variety of sensibilities for a high profile film such as &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot;.<br />'The Prophecy' opens this CD, and Shore explores the dark and the light in a fantastic 4-minute track.  But it's &quot;Concerning Hobbits' where the composer presents his theme for the Hobbits fully developed with Celtic rhythms; as a matter of fact, I shed tears everytime I hear the motif for those little people.  I am also surprised at Shore's epic theme for the fellowship -better quoted in 'Many Meetings', 'The Ring Goes South', and 'The Bridge of Khazad Dum'-since this demonstrates his abilities to write heroic motifs.<br />And let's not forget Enya's tunes which make a great counterpart to Shore's music.<br />All in all, this is a great score.  Maybe all the music is not here, but this CD presentation has the most essential themes which might be more than enough.
B00005U18E|1.0|Why would I care to watch a movie about a pudgy British Twit whining about her weight and her sexlife for two hours??? PURE TORTURE!! Another silly \\"Men Bad, Women Good\\" movie that fails to even come close to the quality of a Lifetime Movie-of-the-Week. One reviewer got it 100% correct: Women and Men view relationships in totally different ways; we stopped trying to find princess charming a long time ago, we can \\"hit it\\" and leave - women in general can't (Why women would want to mimick this canine behavior is beyond me). They also see movies differently, I can't think of any guy who could sit through this mushy mess without out laughing out loud or walking out in disgust, or both. What's worse, Hugh Grant tries to act in this film - BLECH!! <br />Not even John Woo could've saved this dreck from stinking.
B00005T30L|5.0|There are a lot of scenes in this film that I love to watch over and over. One of them of course is the scene in the liquor store with the nunchaku guy and the Greek liquor store owner--it is just so hilarious. Another scene I like is when Enid (Thora Birch) goes into a sex shop with Seymour (Steve Buscemi) and starts to laugh at everthing she sees and says out loud to everyone in the shop: \\"Oh my God, look at all these creeps!\\" I just cannot keep myself from laughing even if I have seen it already. <br />The two girls are beautiful. I just wished there were smart girls like this when I was in high school. Thora Birch is a great female actor. I look forward to seeing her in more films. Scarlett Johansson is another talent to watch--I think she is hot.
B00005OCMR|5.0|The story of _Tron_ is seriously dated at best, and downright hokey at worst, shamelessly plundering elements from _Star Wars_ and _Spartacus_.  But the meticulous hand-painted effects and computer animation hold up well, even after twenty years.  The film still makes an indelible impression; it's not easy to find a child of the '80s who doesn't remember the pulsating costumes, or the stunning video-game sequences (which marked the general public's first glimpses of computer animation).<br />For this &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot; of _Tron_, Disney has performed a loving restoration, and included so many extras and documentary features that even the film's detractors will find little cause to complain.  This is a must-own 2-DVD set.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink, at only 22, is one of the most talented and real songwriters in the pop scene today. I'm really discovering how honest she is with her emotions with her newest album.<br />1. Missundaztood - In this song, Pink confronts the stereotypes and misconstrued perceptions people have of her. She's basically telling her naysayers that she realizes she's misunderstood, but she can be comfortable with that.<br />2. Don't Let Me Get Me - Everybody feels inferior at one time or another, Pink makes it known here. This song is about not quite fitting in with the \\"crowd\\" and letting our negative opinions of ourselves bring us down.<br />3. Just Like A Pill - A song about a love Pink shares with somebody which is addictive. No matter how much Pink's man walks away from her or makes her upset, she can't seem to find the gull to break it off.<br />4. Get The Party Started - A very catchy, upbeat dance song and Pink's biggest hit single thus far. Not really deep, but still fun and witty.<br />5. Respect - Pink's message to the sex-driven young men of the world: Show respect and gratitude towards women before you can expect them to give you anything back.<br />6. 18 Wheeler - A song with such a strong, go-get-'em attitude. Pink sings about being pushed down by others and all the cruel competition in this world, but no matter how much she is knocked off course, she'll get back up and continue being herself.<br />7. Family Portrait - A lot of people connect with this song, and it's no wonder. This is by far the deepest, most personal song on her album, at least in my eyes. I think no description can show you how deep the song is, but let's just say it's about Pink growing up in a dysfunctional, divorced family. The lyrics are written as if Pink was a little girl, writing a letter to her mommy & daddy.<br />8. Misery - Pink's ode to heartbreak. This is a very soulful number, and Steven Tyler of Aerosmith harmonizes well with Pink. <br />9. Dear Diary - Pink talks about learning at such a young age \\"that love leaves\\" and all the bad, wild, free choices she's made in life. But the end feeling is, she has no regrets, and everybody should feel this way. Don't let your past interfere with your present and future.<br />10. Eventually - A lot of young pop stars have their \\"cry for me because I'm famous\\" song, but this one by Pink is very personal and down-to-earth, not a sob story. Pink tells us how it's hard being used, and in all her relationships, everybody just wants something. People would rather look at her as the girl on MTV instead of Alecia Moore.<br />11. Lonely Girl - Pink takes time away from her negative experiences and hurtful past to recollect all her dreams, aspirations and hopes as a young girl. She questions who she really is beyond her image, and what she'll get out of life in the long run. Very nice song.<br />12. Numb - A surprisingly rock-orientated song. Very edgy. Pink talks about a relationship she had that left her feeling so indifferent, she refuses to let anyone else back in to her heart.<br />13. Gone To California - Pink grew up in Philadelphia, and this is a memoir of the horrible shape inner city Philadelphia is in. Pink sings softly of violence, corruption and drugs, and longs for an environment in which she can walk down the streets and feel the sunshine, feel secure. Hence California in the title.<br />14. My Vietnam - Pink takes a gutsy move and compares her troubled relationship with her parents to an infamous war. But I love this song. Pink expresses how it seems the whole world can be against her, how the ones she loves the most seem to hate her the most, and how Pink deals with it.
B00005ASOC|5.0|Finding Forrester is one of the rare movies that don't rely on corny music and movie cliches to touch your feelings.The message is delivered in a subtle form and although the story is not unique,this time I really found myself caring for the characters.This leads me to the conclusion that it is not what you tell,it is how you tell..<br />Jamal(Rob Brown)is a high school student living in Bronx.He has two skills,playing basketball and writing.At a time in his life when he must decide what kind of future he wants,he meets William Forrester (Sean Connery),a once Pulitzer winning author,who dissapeared and decided to live a life of isolation after the publishement of his  only book.Traditionally,it would be expected that Jamal needs Forrester's help to truly understand who he is and what he wants,buth both characters are in need of help of some kind.Their friendship starts in a bizarre way,and change both of their lives.<br />I was not surprised by how great Connery's performance was,because anything else is unthinkable,but Rob Brown really impressed me.And I was even more amazed to learn that it was his first screen presence.He applied to be an extra because he needed money to pay hiss cellphone bill.Well,I hope he did,and that he continues making movies,because he is a natural actor in my opinion.<br />The movie definitely reminds me of Good Will Hunting,the director's other movie,but although I liked that one too,I think Finding Forrester is superior.It doesn't have those &quot;high&quot; moments like Good Will Hunting,but the movie as a whole is touching,and some of the dialogue and the ending is genuninely original and emotional.<br />The DVD has a nice picture transfer.The extras are average,not bad but cold be better.I think this is a must-have DVD.<br />In Finding Forrester,you will find something..
B000002LQR|5.0|Their most successful effort to date. Killer bass and the mix punk-pop-funk-hard rock working just perfectly.<BR>Ages ahead of, for instance, Guns & Roses, which was very successful at that time.<br />If you really enjoy this album, you may appreciate another band that was also killing during that period: check out the sample songs here at amazon.com: <BR>the band's name is CHICO SCIENCE AND NACAO ZUMBI. <BR>They were mixing hip-hop/hard rock/Brazilian music during the period that BSSM came out. <BR>The percussion hits hard and it's REALLY worth a listen.<BR><BR>Their best recordings to date are<BR>- Da lama ao caos<BR>- Afrociberdelia (give it a listen!)<br />As for Red Hot Chili Peppers, it's really good to see this album's line-up back together again. 5 stars for sure
B00005QXDD|5.0|This CD is the absolute funniest thing I have ever owned. It single handedly entertained my friends and I on a 24 hour drive over spring break. The D played a show near where we vacationed, and we even met Jack Black and Kyle Gass, two really cool guys. They don't call themselves the greatest band in the world for nothing. Anyone who likes satire and rock and folk and pretty much any other type of music should definitely own this CD. I listen to it at least once a day.

This DVD is for those who thought evil dead was dead... This DVD is full of extras; bruce campbell's documentary fanalisys is awesome, discovering the evil dead is cool, and there's a whole thing of the book itself... i was waiting for this book to be bigger, but that's OK... Buy it... You'll be very happy with this DVD.

B00005RFQ5|3.0|I have listened to this album with an open mind and even though there are instances of brillance on this CD, to me it lacks much of the intensity and mysterious energy that has been on his past work. Even my wife who does not speak English and has been a fan of his since we've been married (12 yerars) can notice the difference in the intensity of the music on TRC. The electonically manipulated voice throughout the Cd is very annoying and takes away greatly from this album. Prince has experimented with electronical voice manipulaton before, but in each of those instances it enhanced the song or album until \\"The Rainbow Children\\".  I have been a fan (fam as Prince calls it) since almost day one way back in 1978 when his first album came out so I have experienced and supported all his changes throughout the years. The different musical styles, different bands, hair styles, so it's not like I didn't go into this album without an open mind. \\"The Rainbow Children\\" comes off to me as about religon and not spirituality like he has sung about before, he seems to preach rather than express. It also seems to contain some \\"filler\\" songs (Muse to the Pharoh, etc.) that seem to be there to try to keep the story of this \\"concept album\\" going but badly miss the mark.  It seems to preach intollerance and be close minded rather than about togetherness like past projects. One thing (among many) that has really attracted me to him and his music are themes like unity, spirituality, and truth with an unparalled intensity which now seems to be gone. The three best songs on this project are \\"Everywhere\\", \\"She Loves Me for Me\\", and \\"Last December\\" (notice how none of these songs include that annoying voice). I don't understand why he can't make a song about God with the intensity of a song like \\"When Doves Cry\\" or \\"Little Red Corvette\\"?
B000002C1V|5.0|The Final Cut is often over-looked, misunderstood, and improperly judged. It's been my favorite album since college, the last 12 years. I can see why people don't get it- it takes time and effort for this one to grab you but if you throw on some headphones, give it a few listens, you'll realize what a masterpiece it is. <br />The 5 Greatest things about this CD are:<BR>1- The lyrics<BR>2- The fact that so few people know about it- no radio songs, just a shared secret for true Floyd fans<BR>3- The song the Final Cut<BR>4- The last published Floyd song &quot;Two Suns&quot; ends perfectly- with incredible lyrics and a slow fading sax- what a way to go out<BR>5- The background loops- put the ehadphones on, there is so much going on in the bachground- highlight is the &quot;ticking clock&quot;

0062502174|5.0|A lofty promise I know, but from my perpspective absolutely true.  This amazing book touched, moved and inspired me in so many deeply profound ways.  There are some people that have critized this book for suggesting that the message it gives is that we are slaves to fate, that we do not control our destiny.  This is simply NOT the case.  Whoever thinks that is what the book is saying misunderstood the book on every level.<br />This is a book that ENFORCES the idea that we are in complete control our lives.  We are the ones that have the power to achieve our dreams if we choose to pursue them.<br />The book relays this profoundly inspiring message by telling a very simple fable about a boy's journey to discover his &quot;treasure&quot;.  All along the way we see that, in life, we are faced with choices that ultimatley steer us in one direction or another.  The Alchemist suggests that we each have a destiny of our own choosing, and if we pay close attention to the world around us we can start to see the power in our choices and, in fact, once you start seeing that you are in the driver's seat of your own life, you will start to see the world from a whole new perspective.  <br />This new perspective gives you access to SEE when the &quot;universe&quot; is offering you assistance in achiveing your dreams and life goals.  It isn't magical or spiritual.  It's simply about recognising when one choice over another will bring you one step closer (or several steps) to fulfilling your ambitions.<br />Since reading this book I have become so empowered and aware how in control I am.  This book motivated me from the very core of my being and since reading it I have been experiencing amazing results and see how close I am to achieving my &quot;Destiny&quot;.<br />All you need to do is recognise that the the book is steeped in metaphor then &quot;listen&quot; to the book's message and I guarantee you this book will change the way you are living your life and give you the power to FULFILL YOUR DREAMS.<br />NOTE - There appears to be a slight difference in the translation of some of the editions of The Alchemist.  The version I read uses the word &quot;DESTINY&quot; quite frequently, this term is replaced in several editions with the term &quot;PERSONAL LEGEND&quot;.  Since the term &quot;personal legend&quot; is in itelf rather meaningless rather open to interpretation, I suspect that this is some kind of error in the translation that may have led to some of the reader's misunderstanding of the book.  I suggest if you read an edition with the term &quot;personal legend&quot; just remember to mentally replace it with the word &quot;DESTINY&quot;.  The book will be that much clearer for you.
B000050IE6|4.0|The problem with writing a review that has some negative criticism of Opeth, is that all the glazed eyed fans of this band will no doubt recoil in horror and scream heresy. Oh well...<br />I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Opeth have an excellent mastery of melody/harmony/rhythm. In short, the riffs they produce are breathtaking. One after the other, there seems no end to Mikael Akerfeldt's inspiration. Heavy, jazzy, grind, thrash, folky, ethereal. This man can do it all. The atmosphere is undeniably dark. Brooding, melancholy, vicious, terrible. There is no respite for the grim view of unrequited love Akerfeldt presents.<br />Unfortunately, beyond this, it all falls down. As an arranger, Akerfeldt is amazingly incompetent. A total lack of anything resembling thematic development reduces the songs to a piecemeal, haphazard collage of riffs. Now, I hear the band's fawners cry foul: 'you do not appreciate the complexity, barbarian!'. Sure, Opeth's motto is progress through contrast. But when the contrast is not linked by unity, the listener loses emotional contact with the music.<br />However, nothing can really prevent me from liking Opeth. Some passages are incredibly moving, and it is purely the strength of the riffs which carry the album. This leads to say that Akerfeldt has mastered the art of 'microcomposition' but struggles with 'macrocomposition'. Perhaps Opeth's biggest saving grace is that this problem afflicts almost all metal bands. I don't necessarily believe it's a case of a band biting off more than they can chew, just flawed craftsmanship. Sure, through composition is totally valid, but thematic unity is still needed. <br />In conclusion, I'd most highly recommend this to all fans of interesting, progressive, melodic, and emotionally gut-wrenching music. However, if those bands who insist on writing circa ten minute songs are not your cup of tea, you would want to think twice about Opeth. Nevertheless, Opeth's talent is worth a chance. Quitehighly recommended.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I'm not really sure why, but this type of music has always appealed to me even though I don't listen to it on an everyday basis.  Iron Maiden have always played in better than anyone in the business and &quot;A Brave New World&quot; is just more proof to back that statement.  The music scene has taken some drastic changes since Maiden's heyday but judging from these tracks, you'd think that these guys have blocked out every trend and style that has occured over the last fifteen years.  Bruce Dickinson does some of his best singing ever and the band's triple guitar assault add even more to the mix.  &quot;Ghosts of the Navigator&quot;, &quot;The Mercenary&quot;, &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; and the title track all rock like it's 1985 and rival some of Maiden's best work.  Not many bands from their era are around anymore but there's a reason why these guys still play.  It's called talent.  Oh, and their songwriting has never been better.
B000002UB6|3.0|...but George Martin would have saved it. Sure, Phil [messed] up Let it Be and The Long and Winding Road big-time, but there is some mediocre material on here that would have been improved had the Other George been along for the ride. You know Good Morning Good Morning on Sgt Peppers? Its a ... song about CORNFLAKES. John said that it was garbage, and it is probably John's worst songwriting, but George Martin spruced it up and it ended up actually being kinda good! Sure, that kind of spoils the Get Back concept, but he also would have realized that Maggie Mae and Dig It [STINK] and they wouldve been left off. Also, most of the versions of the Get Back album have better sequencing than Let it Be. Plus, Get Back had Don't Let Me Down on it, and thats one of my all-time favourites from that era. Most of the songs from Get Back are available on the Anthology III and Past Masters II. Two of Us, One After 909, and For You Blue are pretty much the same as on Get Back (Two of Us and One After 909 get some studio banter edited out, and For You Blue got a rerecorded vocal track).

6302238331|4.0|This 1971 movie shows the powerful Gene Hackman as the narcotics cop Popeye Doyle.  Although he is a central character, I would be hard pressed to say the movie was about him.  Instead, the movie covers a particular drug deal that Doyle and his partner come across.  You see a seasoned policeman following his hunches and a terrific chase scene.<br />The best part of the movie is that nothing is over-explained.  If you are used to having the movie go into detail to show you why a character is angry about life, then you will probably not follow this movie.  The script keeps to the snapshot of Doyle's life, but particular scenes will tell you volumes about Popeye Doyle.  The writer did not think it was necessary to spend long segments on the background.  This is a more intelligent film.<br />I would recommend this film.
B00000G3AZ|4.0|This is a very different adaptation of a Jane Austen novel to all the others I have seen, but I found the difference refreshing and fun.  There is very little seriousness in this movie and I actually thought it enjoyable to be able to laugh during a period piece.<br />Emma Woodhouse is a young women with no interest in marrying, so she takes in upon herself to see that she finds a good &quot;match&quot; for her new friend, Harriet Smith.  Of course, Emma messes everything up but she barely realizes what chaos she is causing, which is downright funny.  She also thinks she knows everything that is going on in her social circle, but she really doesn't know anything, which is also hilarious.  Finally, Emma quite unexpectedly (to her and to the viewer) falls in love herself, saving everyone from her matchmaking scemes.<br />Most of the performances in this movie are first-rate.  Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as Emma, in my opinion.  She is perfectly snobbish in a likeable sort of way which is exactly what Emma is suppose to be.  Her only flaw is that she might be slightly overbearing, but I really enjoyed her performance.  Jeremy Northam is a perfect Mr. Knightly and Toni Collette is wondeful as the clueless Harriet Smith.  I must give credit for the best performance to Sophie Thompson for her portrayal as the incessant bore, Miss Bates.<br />What I particularly liked about this Jane Austen adaptation is it was less serious and had more humor.  It is more lighthearted and the wit is more obvious, which not only makes the movie a bit more relaxing to watch then some of the other Austen adaptations, but shows how versitile Jane Austen was as a writer.  I think a great deal of thought went into how the novel would be adapted for this movie, which shows respect for the author.  This is definitley a movie I would recommend to just about anybody.
B00000JNO1|5.0|In a way this album is more a measure of Lynyrd Skynyrd than the previous 2 albums.  It is my understanding that the songs on this record were not part of the initial catalogue the band developed (most of which can been heard on &quot;Skynyrd's First&quot;-good album).  For this reason the album feels more like a blues album rather than a rock record.  &quot;Cheatin Woman&quot; is a low-down blues song, complete with all the heart Ronnie Zan Vant could supply.  &quot;I'm a Country Boy&quot; and &quot;On the Hunt&quot; are both strongly guitar-driven songs.  &quot;Am I Losin&quot; may be the best song on the album which includes an excellent finish- features some nice acoustic guitar.  &quot;Made in the Shade&quot; is a bluegrass number...you will find yourself singing it.  If you liked &quot;Mississippi Kid&quot; off of PRONOUNCED you will like this song.  &quot;Whiskey Rock-A-Roller&quot; is a hell of a song and a top notch education in how to be a southern rambler (if you're interested).  Basically don't underestimate the B-side, Skynyrd could write songs...even in a pinch.  This album is no follow-up disappointment...give Skynyrd some credit.
0971855110|5.0|Marla's first book is a triumph!  It's the perfect companion to all of Pam Young and Peggy Jones' books, made even more perfect by the fact that Marla credits the Sidetracked Sisters with her success!  I've been a P &amp; P fan forever, and wanted very much to be organized, but even P &amp; P's easy-to-follow methods eluded me.  I needed someone to guide me step-by-(baby)step as to where to start, and how to keep going.  I joined the FlyLady list in 1999, but still was drowning in CHAOS (Can't Have Anyone Over Syndrome).  It wasn't until I ordered Marla's book, and decided to try to keep my sink shiny, that a little bit of what I've been reading about all these years finally kicked in.  For one solid month now, my kitchen has been clean and uncluttered!  It is truly amazing - my Dear Husband is so happy when he gets up at five A.M. to feed our cats without having to contend with dirty dishes in the sink, and washed dishes all over the drain board.  He loves the no clutter in the kitchen rule.  And I love going into the kitchen and seeing everything shine.  It's a small start (a baby step!), but eventually I hope to see my whole house decluttered and shiny.  And I finally see some light at the end of the cluttered tunnel!  Thank you, FlyLady, and Pam and Peggy, for sharing yourselves with the rest of us!
B00005JKBC|5.0|This is one of the best spy movies i have seen in a long time. Robert Redford is phenominal in this movie. Never a really big Brad Pitt fan but i have to say that he played a very good Tom Bishop. I like the realism in this movie, it's a real spy movie none of these fancy James bond gadgets(although i love those) It's a great movie i would recommend this movie to everyone, especially if you like spy movies.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The original Star Wars trilogy was a defining part of my childhood.  Born as I was in 1971, I was just the right age to fall headlong into this amazing new world Lucas created.  I was one of those kids that showed up early at toy stores, breathless at the thought of collecting the latest Jawa action figure or Land Speeder...anxiously awaiting each subsequent installment of the series.<br />I'm so glad that by my late 20s, the old thrill had faded, or else I would have been EXTREMELY upset over \\"Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\"...perhaps the biggest let-down in film history.<br />What was with all the fart/\\"poo-doo\\" humor?  Can anyone clear this up for me?  Extremely infantile.  Or could anyone have thought of a MORE boring plot device than interplanetary \\"trade and taxation\\"?!?  I still can't figure out what all that was about.  One minute their talking about taxes, the next we're watching some alien animal fart.  <br />Jar Jar.  Perhaps the single most despised and insulting single character I've ever had the displeasure of loathing.  Every second of screentime made my blood boil.<br />Oh, and Anakin.  Could they have found a WORSE little actor?  Did anybody take this kid seriously, EVER?!?  Did he ever convey a single believable emotion?  Not that I remember.  Good thing he wasn't the central character in the entire freaking movie!!!<br />Folks, the party is over.  It's time to shift allegiance to the new great fantasy epic of our time: Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings.
0792846443|5.0|Maybe this is an alter-reality that a lot of writers are afraid of. Being one, I could imagine myself in Paul Sheldon's shoes, that alone leads to a glancing thought of professional change. The movie, though timid compared to the novel, stands up with Mr. King's best work. Kathy Bates (Dolores Clairborne)makes Annie Wilkes a frightening reality and James Caan (Alien Nation) brings out his best performance in years in a deeply disturbed film. You can't help walking away from the film with shivers.<br />***The reviewer is author of: Amber Spirit: Poems & Stories (Hats Off Books, 2001) and a frequent magazine contributor & short story contest judge.<br /><br />Rated and reviewed by ROBERT ELDRIDGE
B00005221M|2.0|I say so because it doesn't have the original cut as well.  So until the first versions out.  I won't get the directors cut too.
0440219078|5.0|After reading some of the multitude of reviews already written about this particular novel, I felt an overwhelming urge to put my (i hope valuable) two cents into the pile.<br />First off, I would like to say that I think that this book is brilliant.  Well-written, a fascinating story of a utopia gone wrong, quite similar to Orwell's \\"1984.\\"  The premise is interesting, the style is fitting, and the layers of meaning are thought-provoking.  Need I say more?<br />Obviously.<br />Looking at the mass of negative outporing which this book has recieved, I feel it is necessary to make some things clear, even though I am quite sure that this review will glean nothing but scorn from those I am trying to debate with.<br />For all of the 12 year-old readers out there, I am somewhat surprised with the disregard and in some cases complete disgust that this book is being recieved with.  When my class read this book when we were 12, we absolutely loved it, and thought much of how we view the world.  Perhaps it is a level of maturity that is the issue, or a societal placement, but the fact that fascinating books like this are being left by the wayside frightens me quite a bit.<br />Now, for the people whom I truly wish to pick a bone with: the adult figures declaiming this book as a piece of [garbage] which does not even deserve to be burned.<br />My first comment would have to be that your are being incredibly closed-minded in regards to this book.  One should not look at a book in a disrespectful light because one disagrees with it.  I mean, you should realize this is a fictional book, and a vehicle for an author's ideas and opinions.  It made so we can look at ourselves critically, not so Mr. Deer can go and play with Mr. Goat.<br />Besides, by saying that you wish to protect children from this kind of [book], you are denying exposure to the real world and the many fascinating viewpoints that the world contains.  Kids see the fact that life isn't happy-go-lucky every day (especially now since events from last September).  Denying anyone the freedom to find out the opinions and ideas of others is a great crime which should not be committed.<br />But hey, I'm just a 14 year-old kid, so what do I know?
B00005JKJA|2.0|I too was also concerned to find that I couldn't skip around between scenes.  I thought it was just my copy.  Luckily it isn't, but unfortunatly the DVD is far from what I expected.  With all the mind games that is played in the movie I expected the DVD to contain some mindblowing extras.  Instead I found nothing.  The movie I give 5 stars...the DVD I give 2.  It would have only been 1 star if there hadn't been &quot;David Lynch's Ten Clues to Unraveling the Mystery&quot; in the sleeve.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is an excellent album. I like it more than all my other CDs, because I like 90% of the songs on Physical Graffiti. If you are a beginning Led Zeppelin fan, this and ZOSO are the two albums you MUST get.<br />When I first listened to Physical Graffiti, I thought that about half of the songs were too bluesy and depressing. But as I listen more over the next few weeks, I grew to like most of the songs. Below are my opinions on each song:<br />(All ratings are out of five stars)<br />Disc One:<br />1. Custard Pie - 4:13 - This was a great choice for an opening track. The same few notes from the beginning continue throughout the entire song. This has a great hard rock sound. ****½ - Four and a half stars<br />2. The Rover - 5:36 - This song has a dragging blues sound. It seems to go by very slowly, so I often skip it. **½ - Two and a half Stars<br />3. In My Time Of Dying - 11:04 - This song defines blues music. When I first heard it, In My Time seemed so long and boring. As I listened to it more often, it became more tolerable. The song repeats the same melody off and on during the song, but adding more variations each time. It is pretty complex, and the lyrics are somewhat religious. Don't miss the studio chatter at the end of the song. **** - Four Stars<br />4. Houses of the Holy - 4:01 - A trademark Zeppelin song with the style that influenced today's hard rock and heavy metal. It has an upbeat sound to it, but the song gets tiring after a lot of listens. **** - Four Stars<br />5. Trampled Under Foot - 5:35 - This song starts off sounding kind of funny, but it is one of my favorite. Another one that influenced modern rock, with a little bit of blues in it. ****½ - Four and a half Stars<br />6. Kashmir - 8:31 - What can I say about this one that hasn't already been said by other people? This is simply one of the best (and my second favorite, with Stairway To Heaven first) Led Zeppelin songs ever created. When I first heard Kashmir on the radio, Isaid to myself, \\"I didn't know Led Zeppelin wrote a James Bond song.\\" Unfortunately, they didn't, but this song reminds me of the James Bond theme. Kashmir is very mysterious song. Perhaps the Middle Eastern melodies hidden in the music add to the greatness of Kashmir. ***** - Five Stars<br />Disc Two:<br />1. In The Light - 8:44 - In The Light has a rather eerie sound in its beginning with the synthesizer playing, but the rock section of the song have a certain appeal to them. This rock section enters at around 3:00 when Robert Plant's singing and Jimmy Page's guitar playing making a great effect together. If you hate this song at first, take it from me; it will probably grow on you. ****½ - Four and a half Stars<br />2. Bron-Yr-Aur - 2:06 - This is one of the few (if not only) Zep songs composed by only Jimmy Page. Obviously no one else would be involved in a solo acoustic guitar mini-song. This English folk-type song is a nice addition to an otherwise heavy rock album.  ***** - Five Stars<br />3. Down By The Seaside - 5:14 - Here is a mellow song which adds to the transition between Kashmir and Ten Years Gone, to heavy rockers. It sounds a lot like something that would be playing in Hawaii or some nice tropical beach resort. I guess that's where the name came from. However, I'm not a big fan of how this sounds, so I won't give it a rating in case others love this song.<br />4. Ten Years Gone - 6:31 - I like this song because of its changing energy, from a kind of sad acoustic guitar to a better sounding electric guitar. Yet another great demonstration of excellent rock. **** - Four Stars<br />5. Night Flight - 3:36 - Boring! This song just seems to be an addition to Physical Graffiti which was inserted just to fill up the empty space at the end of the tapes. Although it is very short for a Zep song, this is one never-ending song, maybe because of its repetitive chords and very basic sound. Another thing, Robert Plant seems to be just talking, not really singingit most of the song. Last but not least, Night Flight sounds way too much like The Wanton Song (the next track, and a much better one). I give it two stars just because it is Led Zeppelin. Otherwise it would be one star, just because it is some form of music. - ** - Two Stars<br />6. The Wanton Song - 4:06 - This is a great Zeppelin song which is not really amazing like some of their songs, but it is just a great song. I like the harsh sounding electric guitar. Led Zeppelin at its best! ***** - Five Stars<br />7. Boogie With Stu - 3:51 - Boogie With Stu has an unusual Old Western sound, perhaps because of the standard blues refrain playing on the background keyboards, and the noticeable piano which kind of sounds like it is playing itself. There is no electric guitar in this song, so the guitar solos which would normally be played on the electric, they are played by acoustic. Listen for a little laugh at the end of this song. **** - Four Stars<br />8. Black Country Woman - 4:24 - I don't really like this song much because of the pathetic singing, but the instruments' effects are nice. Maybe I'd like it better if Plant was replaced with Jimmy Page's Gibson guitar for this song. Don't miss the studio chatter at the beginning of this song (and listen for the airplane). *** - Three Stars<br />9. Sick Again - 4:43 - Here is another song with a blues part in it. The guitar solos are good in Sick Again. It is kind of a song that makes you feel sad that the CD is over and you have to change to another one, which is probably not as good. ***½ - Three and a half Stars
B00004X01U|4.0|I believe that Madonna, could of done way better job than this album. I think she needs to improve her music in the future, and all because she is a mother now, dont mean she cant make better music. It seems like Britney Spears is like taking over her carrer... So I would give this album 4 stars. To tell you the truth I find Janet Jackson's All For You album way better than this one.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks is a novel I highly recommend that you experience. This story takes me home to North Carolina. The descriptions of the area are right on time with the very nature of the small southern town that I grew up in.  You will be able to experience the joy and the pain as though looking through the eyes of Landon Carter as he shares his story in this book.  A Walk to Remember will surely be a book you remember due to the fact that it touches on our deepest emotions and leaves you with a sense of   sharing this young seventeen- year- old's unforgettable story of love, joy and pain. Take heed to the warning in the book, \\"First you will smile, and then you will cry... don't say you haven't been warned.\\"
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie has done a GREAT job on this CD! Almost every track is a dance song, so it's purfect for a party.  Songs like More More More, Love At First Sight, Can't get You Out of My Head, In Your Eyes, Dancefloor, and Burning Up are the BEST! Go out and buy this NOW!
1878424114|4.0|This book is a classic. It gives so much information on the universal truths from the Veda. Sometimes difficult. I missed the link with the practical world. It is not an Absolute Victory by Pino who brings all of this knowledge steps further. The spiritual laws is a book to have for everybody who wants to complete spiritual and self help literature.

B000002J1C|5.0|With the joyous exuberance of youth and a symbiotic blend of volcanic musical talent to fuel them, Yes delivered thier most timeless masterwork only 3 albums into thier career. &quot;The Yes Album&quot; is one of the least pompous examples of textbook progressive music.  Yes proves it is possible to produce compositions that are complex without &quot;showboating&quot;, mystical and transporting without self-conscious pretension, and at times even sweet and beautiful without becoming cloying. As a jaded music fan/obsessive collector who has &quot;heard it all&quot; from &quot;Sugar Sugar&quot; to Sigur Ros, I must say that I never tire of listening to this album, and still manage to pick up new things from it after almost 30 years. If you're new to the group, this is the place to start!

0790749815|5.0|I am only 23 years old.  I am not enough to have been around in the Hollywood Heyday where the stars were bigger than life and the studios ran like well oiled machines, cranking out one star after another.  That is why I love movies like this because it allows the younger generation a glimpse into the past where the stars were relatively well behaved and free from addictions.  Perhaps this is a romanticized view that Hollywood wants my generation to believe, but I believe it to be true.<br />In North by Northwest, Cary Grant is a blatant stud.  He has the nice clothes, gets all of the pretty girls and has that smooth talking manner about him.  Lets not forget about Eva Marie Saint.  In my opinion she must have embodied the definition of \\"Blonde Bombshell.\\"  Both give great performances as Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendall, their respective characters.<br />The plot revolves around Thornhill, an advertising executive who encounters a case of mistaken identity.  It becomes clear that he is being used as some sort of pawn in a game of chess between US and foreign agents.  Thornhill is mistaken for George Kaplan and then framed for murder.  This series of events leads him to try to escape the whole situation.  Along the way he encounters a beautiful Eve Kendell and we are not sure what her motives are.<br />Again, I was not around in Hitchcock's time, but he is known as a master of suspense and North by Northwest does not disappoint.  This movie was listed in the top 25 of the greatest movies of the 20th century by the American Film Institute and rightfully so.  North by Northwest is an exciting thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire movie.  It has more ups and downs than a San Francisco avenue.  I would highly recommend it for any avid movie buff, but especially for those Gen. Xers who have no idea what the `50's were like.
B00005O5CM|4.0|Legally Blonde is a movie about a ditzy sorority girl who decides to go to Harvard Law School after her boyfriend dumps her for not meeting his family's standards of seriousness and success. Though Elle Woods (played by Reese Witherspoon) is clueless about life and overly concerned with fashion and other trivial matters, she is by no means dumb. She mantains a 4.0 average at her college, and later becomes very successful as a law student. Though the film makes no attempt at being realistic, the stretches of reality aren't painfully unbelievable, as in some comedies. There are a couple of really lame scenes, such as the \\"Bend and Snap\\" scene where Elle tries to teach a friend how to get a man's attention, but most of the scenes are just pure fun. You'll laugh at the clueless mistakes Elle makes that have her sticking out like a sore thumb in Harvard, and will probably also find her personality charming. This is a surprisingly satisfying comedy, and Wiherspoon's performance should make the film enjoyable for just about anyone.
0684874350|4.0|Angela's Ashes is a memoir of Frank McCourt's childhood in Brooklyn, New York and Limerick, Ireland.  McCourt and his family were extremely poor and resorted to begging at times.  They relied mostly on the goodness of neighbors and friends and the charity of the St. Vincent DePaul society.  It is a tale of humor and sadness alike in which McCourt is very effective in portraying some aspects of his impoverished childhood and not so great at others.<br />McCourt does an excellent job of characterizing his parents, especially his father who liked to come home from a night of drinking and make the boys line up and promise to die for Ireland, who was at war with England at the time.  He also does a great job of capturing the methods of the priests and nuns in their attempts to make their congregation more devout Catholics.  Many of McCourt's confrontations with priests are somewhat comical, especially when he tries to explain to one priest during confession why he was doomed for \\"going at himself.\\"  The priests used the threats of Hell and Eternal Damnation to ensure the proper behavior of their congregation, the children especially.  It is with great perspective that McCourt represents how his views on life were influenced by the Catholic Church.  Lastly, he paints a very realistic picture of what it must have been like to live in the abject poverty of Limerick, Ireland.  From his descriptions of \\"going on the mooch\\" in farmer's fields to scrounging for scraps of fish and chips outside pubs at night, McCourt is able to capture the methods by which the impoverished people of Limerick made ends meet.<br />There are, however, a few areas in which I felt that McCourt came up a little bit short.  For instance, I think the book gets a little bit repetitive at times.  Almost every story was some variation of another in which McCourt was worried about his father's drinking, his mother's health, his eternal damnation for \\"going at himself,\\" where his next meal was going to comefrom, or earning his fare to back to America.  I was also opposed to McCourt's justification for stealing from one of his employers.  He stole just a few pence at first, but eventually 50 pounds from his deceased employer.  He fancied himself a Robinhood of sorts, but to me he came off as just another petty thief.<br />All in all, McCourt did a great job with this book.  I did not give it the full 5 stars because of some monotonous and boring portions and the persistent rumors that this was only loosely based on his childhood and is in fact a work of Fiction.  If this is true, it would be a great testament to McCourt's writing ability, but I would feel betrayed.
0805062971|5.0|Palahniuk has got to be my choice author, from everything I have read he's topped it.  <br />The book is even more in depth than the movie however both media were fairly similar besides a few switched lines.  Actually it was remarkable how close the movie got to the book, I think that says something about how amazing the plot was by itself without being messed with.  <br />My recommendation:  watch the movie once; it'll give you an intro to the characters, the mood, and the setting.  Watch the movie a second time; that'll let you see the more humorous side to the movie and the overlooked scenes.  Now read the book; it will take you by surprise how the book is formatted, I now prefer this style.
B00000AFFF|5.0|To be honest I've never been a fan of any Elvis Costello albums beyond his years with The Attractions. Everything seemed too experimental and unaccessable. Besides, I didn't want my image of &quot;Angry Elvis&quot; to be tainted by what I considered to be less-than-stellar work.<br />Fast-forward 18 year into the future. I now listen to NPR (a bit of a change from the Angry Elvis days when I also listened to AOR, heavy metal, etc.) and they start rotating four or so songs from &quot;Painted.&quot; I recognized the voice, but the music, like most of what this station plays, is of a jazz/blues bent. Wow!<br />Bacharach's influence gives the album a swarmy adult quality that strangely blends well with Costello's acerbic underpinnings. The angst is still there, brilliantly veiled in an adult contemporary visage that makes for a potent contrast. Though I use the them &quot;adult contemporary&quot; the music itself is significantly more intelligent than the commercialized variety.<br />It is, to say the least, a rare find. <br />Elvis (along with half of The Attractions) is soon releasing &quot;When I Was Cruel,&quot; a return to the rocking style which probably means &quot;Painted&quot; was a one-time stroke of brilliance. If &quot;Cruel&quot; maintains the same caliber of songwriting it will hopefully be another top-notch effort by an Elvis who can no longer be catagorized.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Let me start by saying that I've been aching to see this brilliant film since last fall, but instead had to wait till video.  And boy, oh boy, was it worth the wait!  Richard Kelly presents something stunning here.  At times mordantly funny, shrewdly satiric, eerie, tragic, but always fascinating, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; is an inspiration for people like me looking for something that will come as a revelation.  Jake Gyllenhaal does tricky, effective work here, and carries the film strongly.  Mary McDonnell is first-rate, and the rest of the supporting cast know exactly what Kelly wants from them.  Touching, funny, surprising and entertaining, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; will remain one of my favorite films of all time.  The only negative to come of my love for this film is that too many people I know who don't have the appreciation for this work of art have seen it and are singing its praises.  I wish I hadn't shown them so I could keep &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; and its beauty all to myself and those I think will appreciate it like me.  Thanks to the luminous Drew Barrymore for getting this film and filmmaker where they belong.

B0000542DJ|5.0|Director Oliver Stone tackles the biggest conspiracy theory of all time in this all-star cast, big budget production. It is not that easy to defend a theory like this, but Stone packs in a great deal of believable evidence to back his claim. The idea that there was more than one individual involved in the assassination of President Kennedy doesn't seem that far off the mark after viewing Stone's three hour plus masterpiece. Kevin Costner brilliantly plays District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man in history to bring someone to trial for the murder of President Kennedy. The rest of the cast is great, I especially loved Joe Pesci and John Candy - two very different roles than what they were used to. What you may not read on the trivia section for JFK is that Martin Sheen did the voiceover narration for the film, he played President Kennedy in the TV series \\"Kennedy\\" and in THE DEAD ZONE he plays a politician that faces an assassination attempt. JFK took two Academy Awards for best cinematography and best editing. These two awards were well deserved as Stone is now notorious for editing black & white sequences with color sequences which blend together beautifully. This film will always be a milestone, in my opinion, in risk-taking cinema. Whether you believe it or not, you have to give the man credit for going against the common ideology and making a bold statement that we don't have to believe everything we hear and we don't have to swallow everything whole, that it is good to question things no matter how tragic they are. \\"Let the truth be told though the heavens fall.\\"

Dude, when the genre was created the last thing the forefathers had in mind was sophistication and responsibility! Remember: Every Beatles has it's Rolling Stones (thank god!), if you know what I mean. Well, at least Andrew W.K. knows and sticks to the true meaning of rock 'n' roll all over this bad boy. Buy this album now!! Rock on.
6305313687|5.0|When I first saw this DVD, I was stunned.  Words failed me for at least a few minutes.  The artfull way that this story was put together sends you into a world of raw reality that can make anyone feel the fear and anger the characters protrayed.  I really loved the flash backs in black and white.  There is so much in this film that every time that I see it, I STILL see something that wasn't there before.  All I can say is that this movie is priceless and one for every one to see.
0060977493|5.0|I loved this book!  But it is not a book that can be read lightly or quickly. Rather it is one that must be read with time and intelligence.  To read it abstent-mindedly means that you read it without gaining from it.  It's a great book about a post-colonial country and it offers a perspective that is different than that of the Western one [the perspective that most of us also equate as the &quot;only&quot; perspective]. Pick it up and experience what the &quot;God of Small Things&quot; has to offer.  You won't regret it!
0451450523|5.0|When I saw the movie on TV awhile back, I was enchanted by the movie and the story.  At that time I didn't remember the name to the movie, and I thought nothing of it, that it will come back on.  But it never did, and for many years, I would ask and ask if anyone remembered the name.  I was going to give up hope until one day my friend told me it was &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;.  I rushed to my  local bookstore and bought the book.  And I instantly remembered the feelings I had while watching the movie, but they were intensifiyed because of Beagle's way of writting, how he puts things together and draws the reader into his world.  I liked unicorns when I saw the movie, but his book made me fall in love with them.  And to this day I still remember the joy, sorrow, hopelessness, magic of this book.
B00005NB8J|5.0|Stargate was perhaps one of the most thought provoking films of the late 90's. Kurt Russell and James Spader are fantastic as the two heroes who battle Jaye Davidson. I Recommend this to Sci Fi Fanatic who can answer the question Would You enter The Star Gate not knowing where you'd end up. (On A personal basis this film's desert scenes were shot in Glamis Valley CA where I Used to Live).
B00005OM5L|5.0|1. He sings BEST in this LIVE, I think.  So mature and so powerful.  Listen to &quot;five long years&quot;, my favorite track.<br />2. His performance is as good as in the past, though there are a few picking errors.  In this LIVE, you gotta especially focus on his GUITAR TONE that is just amazing. <br />3. The band's (including the backup vocals) performance is wonderful.  You will notice that one of the vocal (blonde) appeared in &quot;24 nights&quot; as well as EC's one time performance at SNL.  <br />4. The overall sound quality of this DVD is excellent. <br />5. The picture quality of this DVD is also excellent. It's just like you're in the Park.<br />Overall, I believe this LIVE is simply the best of EC and the DVD is very well made.  I strongly recommend to own one.  You are highly unlikely to regret it.

6300214044|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was an accident, really.  I was only flipping channels and I happened to see Anthony Hopkins in a black and white movie, so I stopped flipping.  It was the beginning of the movie, I had not missed much.  All I can say is... Wow!  I purchased it immediately after I saw it.<br />I liked the fact that the movie, though filmed in 1982, was done in black and white for a little more authenticity.  All of the actors and actresses played their parts wonderfully.  John Hurt does a great job portraying John Merrick as he easily works his way into your heart.  Anthony Hopkins does a nice job playing the doctor whose only interest in Merrick is to advance his own medical career.  Soon, though, Hopkins character is soon emotionally attached to Merrick.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates true stories about the triumph of the human spirit through the most difficult of circumstances.
B00005NWLO|5.0|Sure Lynyrd Skynyrd were could make phenomenal studio albums, but in the end (like most dirty, raunchy, simple, have a beer and rawk groups) their claim to fame was without a doubt the live show. In their prime they were a first class live act, and One More From the Road proved to be the perfect example.<br />It was the '70s, and in this long gone era the mainstream was loaded with great live acts. A live album could be an artist's entrance into the mainstream (The Allmans At Fillmore East, Kiss's Alive!), an artist's claim to fame (Frampton Comes Alive), or the peak of an artists' catalougue (see previous examples). Lynyrd Skynyrd was the perfect sample, and here they caputure it perfectly, performing all their best songs from Free Bird and Sweet Home Alabama to Call Me the Breeze and Tuesday's Gone in all their power and fury. Most, if not all of these versions are better than their studio counterparts and songs such as Searching, Travelling Man, T for Texas, and Crossroads are simply stunning on the live stage. Then their is of course their magnum opus the epic Free Bird, played ten times better than ever with the triple guitar onslaught.<br />However this new version isn't perfect. The alternate versions are at times exact replicas of their original release counterparts, making it at times repetitive. (Plus putting Free Bird at the beginning of a disc seems VERY misplaced) However this is made up for amazing liner notes (some of which are written by Cameron Crowe) and the overall quality of the music, not to mention the magnificent sound.<br />Bottom Line. If you love raw, energetic, raunchy, simple southern rawk then this is for you. In some ways I see this deluxe edition a cruel coincidence. The original Lynyrd Skynyrd was ended thanks to a tragic plane crash. This new edition was released on September 11th , one of the darkest days America has ever known. Lynyrd Skynyrd is so synonymous with American rock, and if you ever need to cut loose from all the terrible things that happen  in the world, grap a drink and a burger and rock with some of the greatest rockers in the world, and one of the greatest live albums EVER!

B00005JKJA|1.0|Sitting through a showing of David Lynch's \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is like being attacked by a gang of psychotic thugs..you beg for them to stop but they keep coming at you; in this case for an interminable 2 1/2 hours.<br />Ever since 1986, Lynch, in one way or another has been trying to recapture the success of \\"Blue Velvet,\\" a totally original, cult blockbuster that boasted some of the weirdest images in film history (who can forget, for example the sight of Dean Stockwell in drag lip-synching Roy Orbison's \\"In Dreams\\" into an industrial lamp while Dennis Hopper, his face contorted in pain, mouths the words along with him).<br />Once you make a film as completely over top as \\"Velvet\\", any attempt to recreate the feel is bound to end up in silly self-parody.<br />In the case of \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" a couple of clever Lynchian moments(the meeting between the film director and \\"The Cowboy,\\" for example) aren't enough to save what is essentially an incomprehensible mess of a movie that seems to go on for centuries.<br />It's not a good sign when you watch a film and start praying for closing credits that never seem to come.<br />***<br />Special features on the DVD are practically non-existent, save for the theatrical trailer...in the case of \\"Mulholland,\\" that's a blessing!

B00005QZ7U|1.0|Ummm.... I watched this movie at work one day because we had to preview it for our surround sound display and my boss and we were at a loss.  We had trouble following the storyline because we're not used to watching musicals.  But overall I turned it off and threw it in the trash because it was soo aweful.  The only way I can describe it as an \\"artsy ditsy touchy-feely\\" movie which is one of those movies where you have to be so-called artistic to understand the basic concept of it.<br />All in all:  Guys, don't get this one.  It's one of those chick flicks that us guys are forced to watch with our girlfriends.
0380715430|4.0|Two points.  First, those reviewers who have focused on errors in the book may be missing the bigger picture, which is:  The book does a fine job of surveying the development of language generally, and the English language in particular.  There are probably tens of thousands of factual assertions in a book like this.  Who among us can possibly expect an error-free work of this kind?  A person who is not already an expert on this subject will learn much from this enjoyable work, and the circumstance that there are some minor errors will hardly send readers down the wrong path.  Second:  At least one reviewer suggests that the author adopts an ethnocentric bias in favor of English.  That was not my read.  I found the work to be quite objective.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I really loved Mulholland Drive when I saw it in the theater, so much so, that I bought the DVD on the first day it was available. <BR>What a mistake.<BR> As others have complained, this DVD does not have any scene selection. It is made up of one chapter, one 2 hour and 20 minute chapter!<BR> Others have speculated on why the DVD was manufactured in this way-did David Lynch request that it be distributed without interruption? Who knows, and more to the point, who cares. From one consumer to another, I recommend that you pass on this DVD, especially at $32 retail.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Warren Beatty Produced, Directed and played the leading role in \\"Dick Tracy\\".  A milestone Oscar Winning movie adapted from Chester Goulds 1930's comic strip of the same name.<br />This remastered WideScreen DVD delivers the goods in this fictional comic strip world scattered with numerous Big Star cameo roles hidden behind the Oscar Winning make-up.  Beatty shot this movie in vivid primary comic strip colors.  All sets & art designs(Oscar winning) plus the costumes were all beautifully bold & lavish.<br />Summary: Tracy (Beatty) crime fighter goes up against a barrel full of comic strip Baddies.  Well disguised Cameo roles by big stars; Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Madonna, Dick Van Dyke, James Caan to name a few add to the genius of this film.  The story is presented in a comic strip framed perspective beautifully shot with unbelievable camera angles.  As all old Hollywood & Hero movies the good guys beat the bad guys & win the girl!!  This is fun stuff!!!<br />This DVD is delight to watch.  It is enhanced for the WideScreen HDTV Home Theatre with great 5.1  6 channel Dolby Sound.  There are no extra features but the movie is outstanding, one of a kind delightful eyeful.  This is a must DVD for the Home Theatre library.  Enjoy
B000056K04|5.0|Sure in Everyday, the Dave Matthews Band has a new sound:  the songs are shorter, and you don't as much of the saxophone and violin as on other albums, but Everyday is still a good album.  The lyrics are just as good on the this album as their other albums, and I think the electric guitar that Dave now plays sounds cool.<br />When you compare Everyday to top-selling albums from annoying pop artists like Britney Spears and 'N Sync, you know that this is one of the better albums that's out right now.
0767840135|5.0|After having seen Alegria and Dralion I did not know what to expect when I saw Quidam.  Like all other Cirque shows this has re-invented the circus yet again.  With amazing aerial displays of feat, and some amazing acrobatics on the ground, this show will amaze all.  From the sheer size of the stage under the Big Top to the acts I was very impressed by this production.  This first act was German Wheel and let me say I have never seen anyone do that with a wheel before, you have to see it to believe it.  The Aerial Contortion was amazing, having seen Isabelle Chasse in Nouvelled Experience I was pleased to see her in another production.  The came Skipping Ropes, boy I wished I had paid more attention in gym class, I could be a Cirque star.  Two other acts to mention are the Handbalancing and Banquine.  They will amaze all.  If you are a Cirque fan than this show is for you.
B00005JKYS|5.0|As a son of a Vietnam Vet, I get the luxury of getting feedback on how realistic war movies really are.  When he took me to go see We Were Soldiers, his first comments was on the terrain.  He said it looked as though it was filmed in California.  But that was the only fault we found.  The combat sequences were excellent and truely realistic, you really had to make sure you own Hueys and planes did NOT shoot at you instead of the enemy.<br />The helicopter crash was the most realistic one I've seen yet in a war movie where when they crash they don't erupt in a ball of flame but the emmit severl bursts or sparks and the props spin off, the Hueys don't just explode and this was something which the producers worked really hard on and we could tell.<br />And the NVA and the Viet Cong really did send their troops out as if they were nothing more then dust.  The mentality was there would always be more troops and that was another really good point the movie made.  All in all, a great movie!
B00005OM4N|4.0|First of all, all the negative reviews on this page are just personal opinions .... If you don't like an album, don't criticize it, just explain the content of the album and WHY you didn't like it. However, here is my review...<br />Britney has done a a fairly adequate job 4 this album as a pop singer and as an artist. Some of the songs are provacutively catchy with sexy vocals and lyrics (I'm a slave 4 U, boys). Some are just original pop and are excellent 4 the average fan (anticipating, i love rock and roll, cinderella, bombastic love) And there are some that are just pop/rock style (and are my favorite), they are energetic and Britney performs them excellently. They are (overprotected,lonely,let me be). And the last type of song is why this cd only recieved 4 stars. On Britney's second album, her ballads and slow songs truly showed off her talent and promise vocally (think \\"where are U now), but these slow songsa are way too preppy and u touching, they are (that's where you take me, what it's like to be me)<BR>All in all, the album is pretty much great except for the last two. A good and reasonable buy.
B00003CX5P|2.0|George, George, George. It's been 22 years can't you think of a way to end a movie other than having a little ship fly into a big ship, blow it up, and save the day. Luke Skywalker took his little ol' X-Wing and dropped two bombs into an exhaust port. OK that worked in 1977.<br />Return of the Jedi sees Lando attack yet another Death Star. This time flying into it and blowing it up. OK well see my review for that movie.<br />Now in 1999 Anakin Skywalker flys a fighter into a mother ship, this time lands, and starts shooting the place up and flies out?<br />How will Star Wars II end? I have a prediction. A little ship will fly into a big ship and blow it up.<br />Biggest disappointment since the Star Wars Holiday special.
6304795254|5.0|First, the specs of the dvd.....This should be quick, cause there aint much to it.   Its one of those earlier, 2 sided dvd's (which I despise), with widescreen on one side, and full screen on the other.  Thats basically it, it has bios of the cast and filmmakers, but nothin even close to what could be called \\"special features\\".  Ok, now 'bout the movie....I love the direction of David Fincher almost so much that I forget about the story. A rich, anti-social, reclusive, yet successful businessman, played by Michael Douglas, is introduced to a \\"game\\". This game shoves him into situations that push him to the edge, and in a sense, bring him out of his anti-social shell, making this almost a \\"coming of age\\" movie. This is probably David Fincher's most under-rated movie, 2nd behind Fight Club, which even though got recognized, didnt get near the amount of recognition it deserved. Douglas does a great job playing a yuppie, which is nothing new to him, but I love Sean Penn's performance the most. Penn is already known for his intensity as an actor, and the blown tire scene in this movie lets you see just what everyone is talking about. Much like Fincher's Se7en and Fight Club, this movie is more fun to watch the second time around, for reasons I cant disclose on the assumption that people who haven't seen The Game might read this. If you like Se7en, you like this one. If you love both, hopefully you've seen Fight Club and Panic Room, if not.....don't wait doing so, you wont be disappointed.
B0000027RL|5.0|The album, named after the Jersey number of basketball star, Mookie Blaylock, has been considered as being among the finest and most influential albums written during the 90s, and with reason. Before 91, Michael Jackson was atop the charts, the king of pop. It was not until the rise of Nirvana, and subsequently Pearl Jam, that the 'King' was dethrowned. Armed with epic, sweeping hard rock anthems and the bleedingly powerful vocals from Eddie Veddar, Pearl Jam found itself atop the charts themselves.<br />I admit, I hated 'Ten' for the first full year of it's release. It took some time to sink in. I was too accustomed to Weird Al, Madonna and 'Sweet Dreams'... I was still submerged in the 80s, and the blistering power of Pearl Jam was simply too much for me. Yet as I grew familiar with the Seattle quintet, so did my appreciation of their music. It was not until 93's &quot;VS&quot; that I realized that Pearl Jam had become my favorite band of all-time. I have been ardently following their career ever since.<br />Song by song review:<br />1. Once - With a profoundly suspenseful and edgy guitar to backdrop the first emergence of Eddie's vocals, this song is immediately famous. Plus it's got a haunting oceanic intro to boot...<br />2. Even Flow - Arguably Pearl Jam's most famous song, Even Flow is easily deserving of such status. It explodes into a narrative about a Homeless man, and manages to maintain the ripping intensity for 5 solid minutes.<br />3. Alive - Another contender for the most famous song by Pearl Jam, this song roars for nearly 6 minutes. Starting somewhat slow, this song builds to a climactic guitar solo that rivals any Zeppelin or The Who.<br />4. Why Go - Similar to &quot;Even Flow&quot; in it's blinding energy, this song is a standout among standouts. A guttural, hypnotic guitar underscores Eddie's portrayal of a conflicted girl's tortuous homelife.<br />5. Black - Originally slated to be Pearl Jam's fourth single from the album, following 'Alive', 'Even Flow', and 'Jeremy', this could have become the biggest. A six minute operatic of love and loss, this song is among the most moving in Pearl Jam's catalogue. Deep, gentle guitars accentuate Eddie's somewhat subdued singing.<br />6. Jeremy - Spawned one of the most famous music video's of all time, coming in at #6 in Rolling Stone Magazine's list of 'best videos of all time'. This song carries a strength in every stroke of the strings, that you can't help but be emotionally drained and exhilerated by the end of this harrowing, disturbing epic.<br />7. Oceans - One of the two best songs Pearl Jam ever wrote, the other being track 11 of the same album. This song is beautiful beyong comparison, with guitar and drumwork that match the songs title. As we lilt through this song of reunion, we glide along the waves that Eddie so poignantly describes.<br />8. Porch - Perhaps the most forgettable song on this album, Porch somewhat departs from the overall feel that the rest of the album creates. This is not to say that it is a bad song, as we find Eddie at what could be his angriest. Nearly rapping his way through a lot of lyrics in under 4 minutes, this song is not without it's merit.<br />9. Garden - Underappreciated, this song is quietly suspenseful in it's beginning, until the pressure is too much, and the floodgates open. The tumultuous uprising is textured and melodic, yet like the tide goes down once more before a climactic finale.<br />10. Deep - Just like the title, this song opens with a gaping guitar slide and solo that breaks down the barrier between subtlety and power. Truly deserving to be placed in this perfect album.<br />11. Release - Eddie Vedder's personal tribute to his dad. The guitar matches his soulful wails, begging for the love of a lost father. Finishing out with the same melody that began 'Once', this CD leaves you the way it left you, only now you are an elevated human being.<br />Man, I love these guys...
B0000025R3|4.0|This is one of those albums you can actually sing along with once you know the words, which by the way you can understand without having to look them up on a website. Back in the 80's before there were CD's, The lp stayed a hot seller for 15 weeks. And no wonder, They were a huge hit on MTV and the Song &quot;Who Can It Be Now&quot; was one of the most requested songs of all time as well as the &quot;Who Can It Be Now&quot; video. This is moderate rock. Nothing too heavy. In other words a pleasant upbeat sound. You have the usual drums, guitars, and the like, but you also have keyboards and sax. The tops hits from the lp/cd are &quot;Who can it be Now&quot; and &quot;Down Under&quot;. I own it and I love it. The sounds on some of the songs are very artistic making me think of things like Africa and of course Australia.

All you have is now, and to be fully present means to be outside of the ego.<br />The Power of Now is your personal power brought to light, to show you the power you have over your life and to show you that you are not a victim in any sense. You are in control and this is a huge step towards becoming a spiritual being. Become now, become present, and see the power you have always had.<br />...
B00003CWTI|5.0|Sure, the movie is long, but it is COMPOSED beautifully as two halves....Yes, the first half of the movie is painfully slow, but the culmination of the movie and the drama interwoven throughout the characters would mean little without it.  Yes, this is an actor's dream (and maybe an Arnold Schwarzenegger recurring nightmare), but it is not just a study in acting.  Granted, this is a difficult movie to pace but it is done masterfully with an unbelievable score and soundtrack.  If only Aimee Mann could act.  The characters in this complex, sordid affair are tragic and lovable.  William H. Macy is one of the most underrated actors around. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a star, and John C. Reilly is - almost by accident - both funny and very real in any movie that he's in.  Paul Thomas Anderson is a brilliant director, and possibly an even better screenwriter. He will win two or three Oscars before he's done.<BR>And to the people who hated this film - I'm glad that your lives have been perfect, otherwise you would've gotten this movie.
B00005JKBC|4.0|\\"Spy Game\\" brings back the espionage thriller in a big way. It also brings back Robert Redford, who has been largely absent in the last decade due to his commitments to the Sundance Film Institute. The spy genre is still viable, and certainly so is Mr. Redford.<br />Redford plays Nathan Muir, a CIA agent who, on the day he is supposed to retire, finds out that he has one more job left. His boss asks him to fill the agency in on Tom Bishop [Brad Pitt], a spy who has been caught trying to break a woman named Elizabeth [Catherine McCormack] out of a Chinese prison. Bishop is to be executed in 24 hours, and the CIA has decided not to interfere in order not to jeopardize a trade agreement the US and China are about to sign. <br />The movie uses flashbacks to show the relationship between the three characters. Muir first meets Bishop in the 1960s in Vietnam. Later, in Berlin, the two meet again, and Muir begins a successful campaign to recruit Bishop into the CIA. During the training process, Muir teaches the younger man many tricks. He also explains to him that spies often have to stand idly by as basically decent people get hurt in order to achieve some greater goal. This is difficult for Bishop to accept because he is basically an all-American kid who just wants to get the bad guys, but as time goes on, he seems to accept this aspect of the job. He also meets and falls in love with Elizabeth in Beirut. The affair ends, partly because of Bishop's work. Now, years later, Muir must decide if he can overcome his own corrupt moral code, as well as an indifferent CIA, in order to save his star pupil. <br />Some critics have said that Redford and Pitt are too blandly good-looking to be believable as secret agents, but I disagree. These two could charm their way into any situation, and this seems to me to be a great assets for any spy.  <br />Director Tony Scott uses stylish, MTV-like camera techniques. While they make the movie visually brilliant to look at, they sometimes distract from what is basically a character study. Fortunately, Redford and Pitt's acting abilities, as well as the very decent script, override this problem.     <br />\\"Spy Game\\" came out two months after the 9-11 terrorist attacks, and it shows how quickly attitudes can change. Before 9-11, many of us would have agreed that the CIA's tactics are often unscrupulous and embarrassing. Now, though, Muir's Machiavellian point of view seems almost well reasoned and somewhat just. Note, however, that the film shows what a devastating effect such a philosophy can have on those who practice it.
0767827791|5.0|The film that shot Kim Novak to stardom. Generally regarded as nothing more than an untalented ice queen, Kim Novak had more than just her radiant beauty....there was talent under those smoldering eyes. She was never lovlier or better than she was here as the beautiful Kansas farmgirl who wants to be loved for more than just her looks. William Holden (one of the most natural actors ever) is on hand as a drifter who comes into town to look up a rich college friend (Cliff Robertson) for a job. He proceeds to have a dynmaic effect on the frustrated (sexually or otherwise) women of the town. A kind elderly woman takes a liking to him and lets him clean her yard. Novak's sister (Susan Strasberg) crosses the find line of adolescence into womanhood while in his company. Their mother distrusts him because her own drifter husband left her in the lurch. He even lifts the prim and proper facade of the local schoolteacher (Rosalind Russell). But it is the sparks he creates with Novak that make this a classic flick. (God...just to look at her is to fall in love with her). Though he may have been a tad old for the role, Holden is excellent. The film is a microcosm of small-town middle-America and works as an excellent character study also. It is well worth adding to your collection.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel's  character is a far cry from the good guy image that he normally plays. (He deserves an oscar for that, alone.) He is a hard charging corrupt police officer who breaks all of the rules while training a \\"good-guy\\" rookie. This action packed movie is full of unexpected twists and turns. Not for impressionable youngsters or timid souls since it contains violence, drugs,  profanity and police corruption at its worst.

B00003CXI1|5.0|I read all of the Harry Potter books and enjoyed them all emmensely. I was very scared that the movie wouldn't be able to live up to The Sorcerer's Stone, so I was skeptical about going to see it....<BR>But, finally I caved, and I am so glad that I did because the movie was just as enchanting as the book itself...  <BR>It was so true to the book I couldn't believe it... <BR>Such a great movie...
B000007VCO|5.0|The actual name of this release actually IS Oneness: Silver Dreams Golden Reality. The previous reviewer has this incorrect. There is a track on the disc called Silver Dreams Golden Smiles, but that is not the name of the disc. I've got this on vinyl, and it is hypnotic. It falls into the category of the [[ASIN:B000006ZUV Illuminations]] disc, with Alice Coltrane. Alice is not on this particular disc, but the spirit is there. There are some great heavyweights on this, however. This is an essential for Carlos fans.
B000005IU2|4.0|I first heard this anarchic assault in 1977, and have never been the same since. It is Iggy in his most aggressive mode, and no record, not even &quot;Raw Power&quot; with its superior production and ferver can come near this dangerous attack upon convention. It is a slap on the face of reality; a goose to the reality that stretches from Iggy's howl on &quot;Loose&quot; to the throat-grabbin of &quot;TV EVE.&quot;

0385503954|4.0|Like other reviewers, I wish I hadn't read so many details about this book before beginning it!  Even though it was heavy reading at some points, it was still easy to finish over a few days.  Each character is so well developed, and the story so interesting, I couldn't wait to see what happened.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is easily Lynch's best film.  It finally shows Lynch's original style and surrealist voice, one that makes his earlier journey of Blue Velvet seem tame.  With Lynch, you either love him or hate him, and for those who love him buy this.  The others would at least be able to appreciate the brilliance of each independant scene in the film, even if it doesn't make sense as a whole.  However, the movie does make sense, in a twisted don't-leave-your-brain-at-the-door kind of way.<br />The film can be divided into two parts, the first half intended for network broadcast and the second that adds closure to the narrative (easily spotted in the scene that would never be caught dead on network television).  For Twin Peaks fans, its very easy to see similar quirky characters that would have appeared if this was in fact turned into a series.  Yet due to similar obligations he had with Twin Peaks, this pilot was closed at the end and the mystery is sovled (it is solved, you just have to think about it)  And after seeing this film a few times, as well as Lynch's other works, I've come to the conclusion that all his films are pretty much part of the same large project; watching one of his films will help you understand another.  MD is about exploitation, jealousy, regret, torment, and the scarriest damn homeless man I have ever seen in my life.<br />This may not be perfect for a first time Lynch experience so I would recomend the first season of Twin Peaks followed by Wild at Heart before MD.  Of course, if you really want to get the full appreciation for the film, also check out Ingmar Bergman's Persona and Luis Bunuel's That Obscure Object of Desire (both very enjoyable movies Lynch pays homage too).

0780020685|4.0|I bought this for my husband after he told me it was one of his favorite movies of all time.  I understand it was very advanced for the time it was released, and the story is pretty interesting (to guys especially, it seems), but it might be the type of movie you have to watch in several sittings--it's 3 hours of samurai.  He LOVED it though, and couldn't believe it was on DVD!
6305388458|1.0|Being a very enthusiastic Python fan, I eagerly awaited to see there 3rd film venture.  Boy was I dissapointed.  Life of Brian, to me, is by far, the WORST effort ever from Monty Python.      The film centers around Brian, a person whom a group of people think is the Messiah(Wish I could spell it right).  He then goes on all sorts of confusing experiences, although I fould little intrest in any of them.  To me, the main problem with life of Brian is that it just isint funny.  If you are looking for a Holy Grailesq comedy film, then I recommend you should look elseware.  All but a few of the jokes fall flat(The ones that survive include the stoning sequence and the spaceship).      Even though the Pythons have defended this film, saying that it is NOT an attack on Christianity, I still find it quite offensive, I am not a religious person, and the whole messiah thing offends me.  Oh, and what was up with the completly unnesicary sequence where one of the pythons show up completely nude?      As for the DVD itself, the video quality is good, the sound is good, but the extras are very weak (the only one is charachter bios)  Overall, if you are easilly offended, and hate anti religious flims, avoid this at all costs.    The good:  Um...Let me get back to you on that    The bad:  Virtually everything    And the Ugly:  Just to kill space, the credits at the beginning of the film are nearly unreadable, and go by too fast.

B00005QIPH|5.0|The tag \\"saviours of rock\\" and the like were applied to the Strokes months before this album even appeared. Usually this is enough to put you off as the band in question is actually a huge disappointment. Well, with the Strokes it's different because they may actually be the saviours of rock. The Strokes gave the music world the wake up call that was long needed. Despite all the pop, hip hop and R'n'B that clutters the airwaves nowadays, they managed to make a huge impact and had a big hit album on their hands and it couldn't have been more just. The best proper rock music in years came in the form of the 36 minutes debut Is This It? And indeed it was it. Filled with 3 minute musical nuggets that you've waited your entire life for. A musical tour de force which leaves you riveted, be careful though, the repeat button on your stereo might end up wearing out. As the NME said in May 2001, \\"a band like this comes along only once in a lifetime, you'll be glad they came along in yours\\"
B000054OTY|1.0|DVD much worse than VHS version. One great western that should be terrific on DVD. This copy is horrible.
0790729652|5.0|This is the TRUE Batman. Not the over-dramatized special effects queen and not the guy running down the parking lot in blue spandex, this film brings the cult superhero to life. The film is probably the best out of all of them. In my opinion, Batman Forever and Batman & Robin were both over-stylized and lost all sense of believability. Instead of going for good plots and suspense they took the cheap route and decided to turbo-charge the special effects, a true disappointment. I'm sorry, but not even Jim Carrey as The Riddler can compare to this masterpiece.<br />P.S. Jack Nicholsan is effing great in this movie!
B000002UA9|4.0|Beatles debut album.  Released (in the U.K.) in March 1963.  Mix of covers and a few originals along with their first two U.K. singles.  Some of the material is not up to par of their subsequent output.  Unfortunately if you are making an ultimate Beatles collection you will have to buy it for these tracks:<br />(1)  Please, Please Me.  Their second single and first big hit.<BR>(2)  I Saw You Standing There.  Paul McCartney's first great song.  A rock 'n roll standard?  Maybe;  A classic?  Definately.<BR>(3)  Do You Want to Know a Secret &amp;  (4)  There's a Place. Early John Lennon songs (the first is sang pefectly off key by George) that show him to be a great songwriter from the beginning.<BR>(5)  Twist &amp; Shout.  John's definative one take performance, destroying his throat covering the Isley Brothers classic.  The last song recorded for the album (it had to be!).
B000002J0B|4.0|I agree with the review below that says that this is a good album with the exception of the crunge and ocean.  I would also like to contest the notion that this album is somehow their best bar IV.  Nonsense!  If you also think that this is the first time Bonzo and Jones shined, you have obviously missed something when listening to Stairway and others.  If you want to hear all four guys working together at their best, however, you would do well to check out Physical Graff.<br />Rain song and no quarter are the stand out tracks and make putting up with two [bad] songs more than worth while.  In fact, they are stunning.  Not to be missed.<br />If you take my advice, buy it and play these two songs before you are disappointed by most of the rest!<br />Then go out and buy physical graff and really get down to business.<br />(p.s. If you are new to LZ, don't bother with \\"In through the out door\\", it is [bad material].)
0385503954|5.0|Atonement is chiefly about a child, a little girl named Briony Tallis, who is at the age where she recognizes that the way she views the world is different than how adults view the world, and is desperately engaged in trying to understand why this is the way the world works. <br />A precocious child, Briony actively considers her own sense of reality: \\"was everyone else really as alive as she was? For example, did her sister really matter to herself, was she as valuable to herself as Briony was? Was being Cecilia just as vivid an affair as being Briony? Did her sister also have a real self concealed behind a breaking wave, and did she spend time thinking about it, with a finger held up to her face?\\" If the answer is yes, Briony thinks, then \\"the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone's thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone's claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was.\\" But if the answer is no, she thinks, then Briony \\"was surrounded by machines, intelligent and pleasant enough on the outside, but lacking the bright and private inside feeling she had.\\"<br />The novel opens as a house party is about to begin. Briony is about to discover that her sister Cecilia does indeed feel as \\"valuable to herself\\" as Briony does. Or, rather, Briony is about to ignore this truth, in a moment for which the rest of her life will be an atonement. <br />Staring out of the window, she sees Cecilia, her sister and Robbie, a young frioend of the family, standing by the large fountain. Suddenly, Cecilia, strips down to her underwear while Robbie watches her, and steps into the deep fountain to retrieve something. Cecilia emerges, puts her clothes back on, picks up a vase of flowers that had been hidden by the fountain, and walks into the house. Robbie also walks away. The scene stirs the little girl, who had once confessed her love to Robbie. She has the sense that she has witnessed someadult mystery, perhaps a scene of obscure...domination. Briony does not know what McEwan has told us, namely that Cecilia dipped into the fountain to retrieve a piece of the broken vase, and that Cecilia's provocative stripping had more to do with ...challenge than submission or fear. <BR> Unfortunately, misunderstanding the context as a child will, Briony proceeds to provide a series of adults with a version of event that land Robbie in jail.<br />The events pretty much ruin Cecilia and Robbbie's rather idyllic lives.  It is only later that Briony understands what it is she has wrought.<br />The book then shifts to the war.  Robbie is fighting, having volunteered to avoid prison.  Cecilia is a nurse.  Dunkirk is underway.  This section is by far the best in the book.  McEwan is normal the most controlled and concise of writers-spare, often, to an extreme.  This prose is the exact opposite of his norm.  Rich, expansive and deep, it is amount the best writing I've read in many a year.<br />The book ends with Briony an old woman with yet more changes in perception to deliver.  I know that's not precisely a very informative statement, but to say more is to seriously influence the reading experience.<br />This is, quite frankly, the best book I've read in years.  It's a truly spectacular achievement.

0345428064|5.0|In a situation where Tom Clancy would waste five pages of techno-weenie jargon explaining exactly how a motion detector works, former SAS sergeant Andy McNab writes a few short sentences on how to beat one. <br />McNab's main character,  Nick Stone, describes himself as a 38 year old man with a lot on his mind and not much in it.  Nothing ever goes quite as Nick plans and the results are thrilling,  often quite funny and sometimes more than a little sad.  <br />If you are looking for a book to take along on a trip to read at the airport or on plane, this one would be tops.  A fast read that makes killing time enjoyable.
0788789813|5.0|The Fellowship of the Ring was one of the greatest books that I have ever read.  It had everything you could ever ask for in a book.  It had action, excitement, and even a little bit of romance.  Although this was a grear book, I believe that the next book in the series, the Two Towers, is the greatest book that was ever written.
B0000024IE|4.0|I bought Apocalypse 91 before I heard this, and just about everything they did on that LP was magic. Then I heard \\"Fight the Power\\" and had to rush out to buy this. Expecting \\"Fight...\\" to be the only good track, I was pleasantly surprised to hear at least 3 other brilliant songs (Brothers Gonna Work it Out, Welcome to the Terrordome, and Who Stole the Soul?). The sampling work and production are sparkling, and keep the interest going throughout the CD. Lyrically not explicit enough for me (but I'm a freak!), there should still be enough here to make you prick up your ears. Definitely recommended, but if you get this, then you have to get \\"Apocalypse 91\\" and listen to \\"Get the F**k Outta Dodge\\" or \\"Lost at Birth\\".
B000002J03|5.0|Zeppelin recorded their second studio album in less than a year, recording it while on the road.  So it's impressive that they can crank out such great songs in such a situation.  LZ II is not their best, certainly not their worst.  \\"Moby Dick\\" is their best all instrumental song to date, perhaps the highlight of the album.  Rather average for Zeppelin, but that's why this review has five stars at the top.

0441003257|5.0|I just recommended this book to a friend and thought that this would be a good time to write a review for it.<br />This is one of my all-time favorite books. Ever. Ever-ever!!<br />I own every copy of The Sandman (the comic book written by Neil Gaiman) and several of his books. I own every Discworld book written by Terry Pratchett. It is actually because of Good Omens that I became a Terry Pratchett fan and started reading the Discworld series. I was already a Neil Gaiman fan when I read this.<br />Neil Gaiman is extremely knowledgeable about mythology, religion (depending on your point of view this could also fall into mythology), and history. His humor is dark and twisted...just the way I like it.<br />Terry Pratchett is also extremely knowledgeable about mythology and history. His art is social commentary disguised as comic fantasy. His humor is twisted, but usually not so dark. I kind of think that if he had ever taken to the stage, he would do vaudeville.<br />At any rate, I don't know who had the idea for these two to collaborate...but it was pure genius. I never stopped laughing the entire way through this book.<br />I've recommended this book to dozens of friends and have frequently loaned my copy out. They usually end up buying a copy of their own. It's just a book you want to read again and again. Speaking of which...I think it's time for me to do just that.
B000007SPU|4.0|This LP and its precursor (It'll End in Tears) are breathtaking and tear-jerking. Instrumentally perfect, Filigree weaves an abstract and romantic look at rejection, loneliness and enlightenment. If you have dropped too much LSD and cannot handle the telepathy any more, then this album is for you. Certain tracks require you to stretch your imagination, but reward greatly on doing so. Others are simple ballads with a sad lilt, and purportedly meaningful but safe lyrics for acid casualties. \\"Come here my love...\\" completely haunts me, and just that distantly-sung opening line makes my hairs stand on end. I simply adore this LP. Buy it!
0748662529|5.0|When Mma Romotwe's father dies leaving her his cattle to sell in order to open a business, she decides to go against recommendations of a butchery or some other regular business to open the first detective agency in her country.  She feels it is her \\"duty to help [people] solve the mysteries in their lives\\" (2).  A series of moral tales with a focus on  honesty and doing the right thing range from the case where a doctor does difficult procedures one day and is completely incompetent the next, to wives who want to know if their husbands are cheating, to a woman who is unsure if the man who claims he is her father is really just using her.  The best tale gives hope of the country progressing to allow women to use their intellectual potential and independence freely when an overprotective father hires Mma Romostwe to find out if his daughter has a boyfriend, but she relates and befriends the little girl, Nandira, who displays traits of Mma Romostwe herself.  Woven throughout these smaller cases is a more sinister and bigger case involving the taboo witchcraft circles in Africa where young boys' bones are used for certain medicines. Mma Romotswe's intellect, which she learned early from hard work and simple things like counting trees, always prevails and her intuition (\\"the eyes allowed you to see right into a person, to penetrate their very essence\\" (5) ) proves correct.  A beautiful and uplifting read, this unconventional detective novel is much more than solving a few mysteries.  Also, while tackling everyone else's mysteries, Mma Romotswe still finds time to learn about, fight, and sometimes love both snakes and men as her private history of independence and love unfolds.  At the end of the day, Mma Romotswe focuses on the little things: \\"you could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin\\" (81).
B000002UAU|5.0|This was my first album that I ever owned as a child, and to this day, I still find it incredible.<BR>From start to finish, this album is totally enjoyable. Stand out tracks include &quot;With a little help from my friends&quot;, &quot;Lovely Rita&quot; and of course &quot;A day in the life&quot;.<BR>There isn't much of a concept on this album, but some critics, and fans alike insist that there is one. From what I understand, the concept is supposably the Beatles are in concert (to add irony to the fact that the Beatles quit touring before this record was made), which you hear a band tuning up on the title track, and takes off from there, returning to a repraise of the title track to end the 'show' and then &quot;A day in the life&quot; is suppost to be the encore.<BR>This album was real revolutionary for the time it came out. Every single instrument and vocal was in some way shape or form inhanced by the primative technology that both the Beatles, and their producer, George Martin had to work with. Nowadays, that's almost the norm for bands to spend all their extra time and energy into over producing their songs and albums.<BR>There is also very little time between tracks, which adds to the live feel. Several songs just jump into the following track, almost like a medly.<BR>Whether this was a concept album or not, it's still great. I would suggest it to anyone intersted in classic rock, or even modern rock music.
B000002AGB|4.0|ok, so you have seen the young man blues footage from the who, 30 years of maximum rhythm 'n blues and you wanted to know about the rest of the concert? This is the answer but only the sound and a booklet with several good pictures. The issue of the whole show on video would be a great day in the history of music but only the cd is still a good thing, the whole show as it was and not arranged as in live at leeds.
078322804X|5.0|I was a huge fan of the original screen version and had watched the VHS version which was disappointing due to the quality of the film and the size of my screen. I recently saw this DVD at a friends house with the big screen, home theater experience and was amazed at how well the comedy and music stand up to today's standards! This is still one of the finest films of the 80's and the best action/musical ever. The DVD version illustrates this perfectly.
0452282152|2.0|I heard so much about this book I thought it would be worthwhile, but it was really disappointing.  The plot is paper thin, the characters are flat, and there doesn't seem to be a point other than describing the \\"story\\" of this painting.  Struck me as an MFA writing exercise rather than a real novel.  Also had my pet peeve - a totally unrealistic villian who is evil \\"just because\\" - has no apparent reason to be in conflict with the main character yet pursues her destruction with bizzare singlemindedness (made worse in this case since the villian is a child!  What child can concentrate on one thing for 24 hours, much less years of careful manipulation to destroy someone whom she has no real reason to hate?)  I wouldn't reccommend it.  Maybe it's popular just because it's so simple - unintimidating for people unused to reading.
B0000634EV|2.0|*<BR>NOLA was one of the most amzing CD's I ever bought so I eagerly awaited the release of DOWN II. . .<br />If I had to pick a personal Top 10 CD's of all time NOLA would be in it . . .<br />It is with great sadness that I inform you that (at least to my tastes) DOWN II is a very average CD.<br />About 1/3 of it is slow/accousticy stuff or experimental (like a song with only drums). <br />One of these songs (My Mistake - I think its called) is pretty good. . .<br />The other 2/3's of the CD is heavier, but I found it uninspiring with about 3 (from 10) of the heavier songs appealing to me.<br />I must say we all have our own taste for music and you might really like this CD, <BR>but for me (after how good the first was) this is a real let DOWN<br />===

B00005YW4H|5.0|I am listening to this cd right now!  Ms. Jones has a beautiful voice, and as mellow as this cd is, I am in love with it.  Perfect choice for putting on as you sit out on a warm evening sipping wine and stargazing - alone or with company.  I particularly love &quot;Lonestar&quot;, but ask me next week and I'll have another favorite.  They are all wonderful.  She is up there with india.arie. (I agree, Ms. Krall, while entertaining, is overrated).
B000002U9W|5.0|Opening with the crazy, brute, and incredibly funky suite, Atom Heart Mother is a new direction for the floyd from the start.  The orchestra and the choir add to the allready genius theme melody.<br />If is a sad and scary look into the character of Roger Water's, Pink Floyd's bassist, collaborator, and later, main lyricist. <br />Summer 68 is an orgasmic attempt by Rick Wright, the floyd's keyboardist, to describe the loneliness of one night stands.  The music is excellent and exciting.<br />Fat Old Sun is a relaxing and beautiful track about Cambridge England, the Hometown of the writer of the song David Gilmoure, who is Pink Floyd's guitarist.<br />Alan's Psychedelic breakfast, a recording of floyd roadie Alan Stills, is corny at times, but very satisfying in the end, just like breakfast!  The album is essential to the floyd fan but might scare off a new listener.  Try wish you were here first.
B00005QK3W|5.0|I liked this album...although at first I thought it was &quot;just okay&quot; it really grew on me and now I think it's quite good. He does a few &quot;Beatle-esque&quot; riffs and ditties that remind you of the 'good old days,' which is kind of cool. Can't wait to see him in concert this month!
B00000016K|5.0|This album will do two things: 1. It will change the way you perceive rock in general; 2. You will be able to understand where all rock from 1969-on came from. It's that good. Disc 1, &quot;In The Studio&quot; has the classic &quot;White Room&quot;. If you're reading this review and have never heard this album, and are thinking of buying it, then imagine how you can take a basic one-chord riff, as in Disc 2, on &quot;Spoonful&quot;, for 18-plus minutes, and twist, contort, mold it into a type of improvisation that is rarely (if ever) heard today. Just buy it. You won't be disappointed.
0380796090|5.0|...to escape the winter doldrums! Once I got into it, it was hysterical. Claire learns important lessons about herself and gives her slimy soon-to-be exhusband James a taste of his own medicine. Now if she only do the same for her \\"evil\\" sister Helen....<br />I did think the ending was a little too perfect....suddenly they're all moving to London and everything's peachy? I was hoping she'd stay in Dublin and \\"return to her roots\\" so to speak. But overall a very good read and I look forward to more by the same author.
0790741520|4.0|This 1996 film is about a terrorist hijacking of a jumbo jet to get a jailed terrorist freed. They succeed in this release, but then decide to drop a nerve gas bomb over Washington DC to kill millions. \\"Its only a movie.\\" But I wonder if this movie put ideas into the minds of Al-Qaeda? The hijacking of the jumbo jets on September 11, 2001 follows the ideas of this script. Except they used the jumbo jet itself as the bomb.<br />In 1987, after a problem with a flight attendant, all guns were banned from flight personnel. This enabled terrorists to easily hijack a jumbo jet. This would never happen on the many foreign airlines where their pilots are armed! I hope this mistake will be corrected soon.
B00005QK3W|3.0|Being a HUGE Macca fan, I waited restlessly for the release of Driving Rain. The first disk of \\"post Linda, all Macca studio work\\"...following easily what is considered some of his best solo career work in \\"Flaming Pie\\" and \\"Run Devil Run\\".<br />WHAT with the pre-release rumours promising a new band doing material that parallels \\"The Beatles\\" White Album in versatility and imagination and \\"delivering the missing elements of Pie\\"...which, to a point, Paul DOES accomplish...!<br />HOWEVER,<br />In too many places Driving Rain fails to deliver to these HIGH expectations. The need of more heady lyrics and finer arrangement techniques are easy reasons one uses before considering and classifying this offering a five star disk. However, the tricky part is that the material is there! <br />Paul could have easily strengthened the product by inserting \\"Vanilla Sky\\" on the disk and removing a couple of the weaker songs in the middle. Adding another verse to \\"Freedom\\" and taking the genisis of a wonderful ditty and transforming it from the \\"Chant with Eric Clapton licks\\" (which is still tasty) to a full blown piece of work would have also added to the power of the disk.<br />But, even more to the point, the refinement of the material written directly for DR could have been cleaned up and thereby strengtened. She's Given Up Talking has the potential to be a major hit (ala Rigby, Real Love etc...) if Paul had stuck with the melancholy theme touched on throughout the song; and yet this still remains a solid piece of work and easily my favorite of the album. Competing with \\"Riding into Jaipur\\" which is also absolutly beautiful! Hands down what legions of alienated Beatle/Macca fans have been looking for from Paul since...well 1968, but...the lyric might as well have been deleted...unfortunatly, this thought comes up on more than one occasion.<br />Finally, better song transistion, compression and refinement on the last group of songs \\"Loving Flame\\", \\"Rinse the Raindrops\\", and \\"Backinto the Sunshine Again\\" and \\"DRIVING RAIN\\" could stand next to or surpass Flaming Pie, Tug of War and Band On The Run as Paul's best work! Also, disk opener's \\"Lonely Road\\" and \\"From A Lover to a Friend\\" deliver the 'goods' from early and present Macca days. <br />The fact that he came so close in the brief recording time he chose to work with speaks to the man's genius. I want to advertise for somebody to please replace John to help Paul finish his songs and keep him in line?! Heck, I believe Paul can do it if we would just commit.<br />His melodies are beautiful throughout and if Paul had spent the time to refine and fuse them, I believe he and his new producer would have hit on a powerful combination which could again shake the rock world (even at sixty)! Their desire to use computer technique's to create interesting new sounds with their instruments creating a Rubber Soul (or maybe even Revolver) type environment was hugly successful. His new band gives him fresh energy and direction.<br />Instead listener's must lean on excellent production techniques, fine guitar work and Paul's vocals and excellent baselines which hold this disk together...leaving the listener to wonder just what Paul could have achieved if he had chose to spend some time on post recording editing and looping.<br />It appears that the critical and emotional success of Run Devil Run pushed Paul just a little too far when he chose to continue the Lennon/McCartney strategy of \\"lay it down and walk away technique\\" so successful in Beatle years and successfully duplicated on \\"Run Devil Run\\"...for with a little help from his friends, this could have  been a monster.<br />Lastly, one must classify this latest work as an absolute must for Macca fans...a tease for the avid Beatle fan who thinks Paul is too much pop. The interesting production and guitar work is worth the listen. <br />This one grows on you.
B00005B4GU|3.0|The easiest job in rock today is to be in Radiohead and not be Thom Yorke.  Why?  He does all the work!  The vast majority of this album is Thom whining high above into the clouds with mixed up electronic beats supporting it.  In fact, the only place where this record really shines is where Radiohead turns into a band again-Pyramid Song, Knives Out, Like Spinning Plates (the one exception to the above rule) and Life in a Glass House.  Not even the Radiohead of old, if that's what you're thinking, just a normal band.  Everyone loved OK Computer and Kid A, but Thom, I think we've had enough.  The normal human can only put up with so much high pitched voices coming from a man.  But wait!  There is another side to the story!  This record is absolutely perfect for the live show.  Anyone who's listened to I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings knows exactly what I'm talking about.  Using the rest of the band, he makes the bad songs on this record (I Might Be Wrong, Dollars and Cents, Morning Bell/Amnesiac) sound fantastic, and the good ones (Like Spinning Plates) sound even better.  So what am I telling you?  If you're a diehard Radiohead fan, you'll have already got this record and turn into a raving lunatic over how good it is.  If haven't gotten it yet and want to give it a try...you'll be dissapointed.  Go listen to OK Computer, the one album where all the elements of Radiohead (rock and electronic rants) come together perfectly.  Just not here.
B00005Y1UX|4.0|Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson play a couple in a sudden bind financially.  When trying to strike it rich in Las Vegas fails, enter Redford character to the rescue.  When Redford proposes them the answer to their problems the end result could spell disastorous.  Though the movie never actually shows Moore and Redford sealing the deal, it kinda makes you wonder if it really did happen. One really powerful scene in Indecent Proposal  is when Harrelson is having second thoughts and wanting to canel the deal  tries looking for Moore realizing that they are already leaving via helecopter on the roof of the building he is frantically trying  look for her.
B000059XUO|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. There's been great movies like Blade, Matrix and the new movie Queen Of The Damned, but to me, nothing tops The Crow and I'm begining to think that that no movie will ever top The Crow. The other 2nd Crow movie City Of Angels was pretty good and the last Crow movie was watchable, but not that great. It's the first Crow character Eric Draven, played by Brandon Lee that really made the movie complete. I was deeply sad when he was killed on the movie set.
6300246787|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorite movies.  I was in my high school play of Hello, Dolly!.  I think that Barbara Streisand was at her best.  Walter Matheau was his typical grumpy self, which makes him so endearing.  I am not fond of musicals, but this is one that I will watch over and over again.
B00005TPKD|4.0|This remaster of the first Amon Duul II outing is well worth re-buying.  I already had the previous CD reissue, but this version is eye-opening.  The aural muddiness and sometimes excessive reverb on the first reissue have been stripped away and the volume has been brought up.  It's like looking at a painting that's been restored.<br />Perhaps the best thing I can say is that I found new things that I hadn't heard before, and I've listened to this album many, many times.  There were times I found myself saying, \\"Wait, was this on my other CD?\\"<br />It's not often that you can take something that was cool to begin with and make it even cooler.  My previous review of this CD still stands, but with this remastering I'm even more enthusiastic about it.  This is an essential document for anybody who loves psychedelic music.  If only more of the great German psych bands' albums were remastered this well!  A big \\"danke\\" to Amon Duul II for their remastering and reissue of this terrific music.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Ryan Adams is such a gifted musician, singer, and songwriter. His poetry is right up there with Bob Dylan. His punky country music is just the right mix to make me absoloutely addicted to his music.  I HIGHLY reccomend it.  There are so many absoloutely kick [rear] songs on it that it's hard to choose a favorite. Ryan's guitar playing is magical, and he's has got the sexiest voice to go with his mind blowing songs! The guys a musical genius.  ! BUY THE ALBUM!
B000002U9W|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who says you should buy this album only if you've already listened to the Floyd's more accesible stuff, like &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, etc. It takes a very receptive ear indeed to wander through the complicated craziness and odd arrangements on this record. But once you free your mind from its stereotipical approach to art/space/psychedelia rock, you'll find it rewarding.<BR>Track one, the &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; suite, is like &quot;Echoes&quot; from Meddle in some ways; in other ways it's more like stuff from the ol' Syd Barret days. Kind of a mixture. It's great, though. When I first heard the opening orchestral section I thought it was from some obscure modern classical composer, but then the drums came in and I thought &quot;um, this is new for orchestral music.&quot; I love Gilmour's hawaiian guitar passages. Gilmour is probably the best slide player in all rock.<BR>&quot;AHM&quot; shifts through all sorts of moods, from the placid to the disturbing, culminating in a passage for all the previous melodies at the same time (yep, all on top of each other...) that bursts into a fantastic ending. Then comes the three solo songs, which are good contrast and add stability to the album. I don't think the album would be as good as it is without them.<BR>Then comes &quot;Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;, which is at once beautiful and impossibly wierdo. Three fragments of music joined by bizzare tape babblings and morning noises (I think you can even here someone urinating, somewhere in the mix). But it's not pretensious or annoying; rather, it's like &quot;Dude, this is so wierd it's cool!&quot;<BR>Overall a great effort. The highlights are Gilmour's first slide solo (at about 3:45 on &quot;AHM&quot;) and the piano part of &quot;APB&quot;, where simple phrases are looped together to create a happy, carefree effect. Very good.
B00005JKJA|4.0|...Which brings us to MULHOLLAND DRIVE, which I just watched for the second time in two days. For me personally this is Lynch's best flim since BLUE VELVET. It has more depth than LH, the acting is superb, and it's not filled with weird-for-the-sake-of-weird characters and scenes like FWWM or WAH. It's basically a mystery ala BLUE VELVET for the first 2 hours, and then when The Blue Box is opened we enter the world of LOST HIGHWAY again. The questions raised, the confusion suffered by viewers, is all part of the wonderful experience of watching a Lynch film. I do not think he's purposefully leaving out pieces of the puzzle to frustrate or anger viewers, but rather he makes movies that can be many things to many people. Theories abound, I have my own which I'm not going to share here, and for those who like a good mystery it's the most satisfying way to end a film, by basically not ending it. You cannot leave a Lynch film without thinking about it, how many other directors can you say that about these days? Kudos as always to Lynch. My official rating is 4 1/2 stars.
B00005Y228|4.0|You really don't get many like this one--strong, decidedly moving and yet smooth and unobtrusive. No mysterious lyrics or overpowering vocals and percussion but still in a dimension way above bland. More than merely pleasent, this one gets you going and makes it hard to sit still. <br /> Minogues's singing manages to be quite provocative, always seductive but with an elusive quality and never profane. Many of the songs have riffs that are reminiscent of other artists, particularly Madonna, but still it's unique and original enough to clearly be distinuished from any one else. <br /> If you're looking for a CD that makes you feel it without getting too heavy, warm up with this one. Maybe thats why they called it FEVER!!
B000002MP2|5.0|This is a must buy CD. All of these tracks are good because they relate to so many teenagers. And parents don't realize what they're singing about, so they're cool with it. Go buy this and all of Green Day's CDs (except Warning, which you'd have to make your own call. Its okay, but not as good as Dookie). Go buy. Now.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I like music with range. Music I can listen to when I'm riding the bus, when I just want pleasant noise to distract me. Music that sustains me while I slave over my research paper, relaxing my right brain while my left brain works. Music I can listen to simply by itself, as pure entertainment. Music I can listen to in a contemplative mood, and see all kinds of depths in it. IMO, there are only a few bands that I have heard with this range - they are Radiohead, Pink Floyd, Tool to some extent, Doves (British non-weird rock), and the Beatles. It's no accident that my MP3 collection (1.01 GB right now!) is mostly these bands.<br />From the opening guitar riff of Airbag (which to this day still stymies me when I try to gauge the tempo of the song!) to the very end of The Tourist, this CD is a journey for the ears, the mind, the heart, and especially the soul. Above the beautiful melodies and harmonies, the flawless musicianship, the compelling lyrics, is a core of pure emotion. Over the album this emotion changes, traveling through (as I interpret it) birth, hope, loss, depression, rage, insanity, and finally rebirth and peace. This is the strongest resonating pattern in human thought - more simply: birth, innocence, disillusionment, conflict, and resolution - and Radiohead nails every single one. They evoke these emotions so powerfully and deeply that I can recall the feelings simply by glancing through the tracklist - I don't necessarily remember the lyrics or music, but I feel the feelings.<br />Radiohead's music is what I could play someday. Not merely the actual playing, that's nothing when you have as many takes as you need and as much practice as you need. The music itself is wonderful. It sounds so simple and so compelling, but when you examine it, it's truly a work of art. Not content with the standard forms, Radiohead invents new chord progressions, and fills them with melody, harmony, and rhythm that complement each other perfectly and never leave a gap in the fabric of the music.<br />Radiohead is music that changes you. Furthermore, it is music that must be digested over time. Radiohead is not a casual listen. If you are at all receptive to the genre, you will love Radiohead without knowing why at first. You will find yourself listening to it more and more often... and you will not understand until you articulate everything as I have just done right now. Not until I wrote this review did I truly understand the album - and the review simply wrote itself. The change I've just undergone was in me all along, it just needed this to come out.<br />This is music for the ears, sustenance for the soul, and a journey for the mind. This is music that, like classic literature, will live on forever in one form or another.e fabric of the music.<br />Radiohead is music that changes you.

B00005AXEL|5.0|In all honesty, I thought Stevie Nicks' best days were long behind her.  I'm a major Fleetwood Mac fan and a minor Stevie Nicks solo fan by comparison.  I never thought she'd have a better solo album than \\"Bella Donna\\", but she's gone and done it 20 years later!  Amazing.  While I thought \\"Bella Donna\\" was good, I find \\"Trouble in Shangri La\\" excellent!  It's so wonderful to finally hear old songs like \\"Candlebright\\" and \\"Sorcerer\\" prefessionally done and polished.  I'd previously heard them as diamond in the rough \\"demos\\", ages ago.  Thank you Stevie, for finally giving these gems to your fans!   \\"Planets of the Universe\\", the title song, and \\"That Made Me Stronger\\" (about Tom Petty kicking Stevie...into writing again) are my favorites.  I can't wait for the new Fleetwood Mac album and tour, because Stephanie Lynn Nicks is obviously back in gear!
B00005NWM3|5.0|When I first heard Nickelback last year I knew they were good, but when I heard How You Remind Me off of their lastet I knew they were AWESOME. It includes songs about different feelings about life like How You Remind me. It also has songs about the bad things in life that happen to people like how Never Again is about domestic violence and Too Bad is about messing up. If you are just want to get this CD for How You Remind Me you ar ein for a huge surprise.<BR>Overall this CD is a great deal and very fun to listen to. If you are a rock fan this is a must-have CD. All the songs are great, but a few really stand out. The best songs are:<BR>#1 Never Again<BR>#2 How You Remind Me<BR>#3 Woke Up THis Morning<BR>#4 Too Bad<BR>#9 Hangnail
B000060MY6|5.0|This is NOT a movie to rent or buy if you want to sit back and veg out for an evening. In other words, you should be prepared to be fully engaged and ready to ponder all the twists and turns in this one. On the surface, it is the story of 2 women in Hollywood, one suffering from temporary amnesia as the result of a car accident and the other an aspiring young actress with visions of stardom in her eyes. But like most Lynch films, the surface is just a way to get the viewer to consider deeper realms of reality and possibility. There is the dreamlike world that is a Lynch trademark as well as quirky characters which come and go. Be prepared for sudden twists and turns in the plot and don't expect a logical narrative or storyline in this one. If you want a movie with a conventional plot, one that is easy to follow - avoid this one. On the other hand, if you like movies that leave you pondering the mysteries of the world and which don't have to make &quot;sense&quot; in any conventional way, this is a good choice.
6304082428|5.0|I own this and watch it all the time. I love this. Colin Firth is absolutely to die for... The looks he gives Lizzy are just enough to melt me... You won't be able to tear yourself away. This is just a purely wonderful movie. The actors and supporting cast are all great. Colin Firth especially........
B0000060NH|5.0|The title track is reason enough to own this great LP. It's a jazzy, strutting, ethereal masterpiece of music that hasn't aged a day in almost 30 years (don't those cymbals and echoing snaredrum wafting in over the piano on the intro just give you the chills?) and stands as a major landmark in both movie music and the career of Marvin Gaye. The rest of this soundtrack is just that, beautiful 'sound'. The instrumentals that comprise this collection incorporate elements of jazz, soul, classical and light pop, to stunning effect. While the movie itself hasn't exactly endured very well, the accompanying music is timeless. Mr. Gaye had yet another classic on his hands.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This CD ROCKS....  Don't know why I like it.  The songs are simple and not complex at all.  They rock hard, but for some reason put a smile on your face.  Can't stop listening to it.  Buy this CD pop, it in your car and rock.... Andrew wears dirty white jeans and doesn't give a $hit.  You should buy this CD and crank it loud.... Like you don't give a $hit either
B000002LFZ|4.0|While this is a good selection of their more well-known<BR>songs, it omits at least two tracks I felt should have<BR>been included on this album. Gold Dust Woman and The<BR>Chain were on the monster album Rumours, which is a<BR>classic album in its' own right, but were omitted from<BR>this collection. As other previous reviewers have <BR>mentioned, there were several noteworthy tracks that<BR>were missing. Perhaps if Fleetwood Mac releases a <BR>deluxe edition of their Greatest Hits album, it can <BR>include all the missing essential tracks that were<BR>not included in this version. AC/DC has done this with<BR>their live disc from the early 1990s, and the same<BR>applies for The Who, who had released the Live At Leeds<BR>album, and then finally released the deluxe edition<BR>with the full show last year. Of course, the difference<BR>this is a studio album, not a live album like the<BR>aforementioned albums.
B00005JKED|1.0|I'm sorry to say that this movie was horrible.  It is an insult to the policemen and women who serve our streets.  While Denzel Washington's performance is good, as it normally is, it is not superb.  The script was poor and shoddy.  I have to say that Ethan Hawke's performance as the fresh new blood for Denzel Washington's elite Narcotics squad out did that of Denzel's perfomance.  Overall this movie made me sick and sorry for even watching it.
0066620996|5.0|Buy this book and read it!<BR>Why?<BR>The short answer:  <BR>Your boss and their boss are reading it.  Get a leg up on what they're thinking.<br />The long answer:<BR>When Built to Last came out, I saw the CEO's secretary on the elevator with her arms full with copies of it.  At my new company, the CEO sent a memo out to his reports highlighting the deep thought of the book.  Fad or Fact - you need to know what the people up above are thinking.<br />What's it about?<BR>&quot;Build to Last&quot; was about how to infuse a company with the value and culture to have outstanding returns.  &quot;Good to Great&quot; is the book for the rest of us - we're working at or with &quot;Good&quot; companies that want &quot;Great Performance&quot;.  The benchmark - stock market performance.  The author charts how companies stuck in mediocrity make that leap to greatness.  The book compares them to similar companies, which don't make that leap.<br />Anything original?  <BR>You bet!  There are several counterintuitive insights in the book:<br />1 - Companies that make the transition get the right people on board before changing strategies.  (You'd think strategy would drive the people you hire, no?)<BR>2 - The CEOs responsible for the dramatic improvements were low-key insiders, not high profile outsiders.  (No bidding wars for the GE #2s)<BR>3 - The changes tended to be the result of repetition of good things, not a huge strategic change.  (The flywheel concept)<BR>4 - Technology supports the change, but doesn't lead it.<br />Is the research real?  <BR>I'm inclined to say yes.  The book is the result of painstaking quantitative research.  Companies were identified based on rigorous stock market performance - certainly a higher criteria than used for &quot;In Search of Excellence\\" A side note is that many hard research business books are bad reads - this book flows very quickly.<br />Any knocks?  <BR>The one credibility hit is that several companies that were dubbed &quot;Built to Last&quot; are struggling.  This highlights that Collins is not one of those genius's that's &quot;Always Right&quot;.  (Neither it Tom Peters, but it's still great reading)<br />So buy the book, get in your boss's head, and anticipate the changes to improve your organization.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This is the smartest, most intoxicating film I have seen in years. It has more to say about the nature of the mind in terms of the processing of experience, both real and fictional, in waking and unconcious states. I'm sorry, but this was far and away the best film of the year...
B000065U1N|4.0|Before talking about the movie, and while talking about it, it's important for me to mention the book. My boyfriend (a former Ranger) has long spoken of \\"Black Hawk Down - A Story of Modern War\\" by Mark Bowden as being an excellent account of the conflict in Mogadishu, Somalia. It was a book that was on my long list of Books To Read Soon, but I hadn't ever gotten around to it. When the trailers for the movie started showing, I made an attempt to read the book before we went and saw the film, but I found the author's writing somewhat bland and I had no image of what some of the settings he talked about looked like, and thus I abandoned it after a few chapters in favor of other books. <br />Then we saw the movie, and it renewed my interest in the book, as the book gives much more of the internal dialogue of the soldiers, and more detail. Having seen the film gave me a much better feel for what I was reading about; what the streets and buildings looked like, et cetera. I finished the book, and while I still have the same complaints about the author's writing style, it was a good book. The movie and the book are excellent companion pieces to each other. <br />The movie...it's difficult in some ways to describe. It's not an \\"entertaining\\" movie, but it is an important film to see, simply to bear witness to the event itself. <br />Some of the commercial reviews I've read are complaining about the gore in the movie; this strikes me as completely asinine. The movie doesn't make a huge deal of the blood and gore, and in fact, doesn't have the level of gore the book contains. The gore is simply a part of the story, and would be unavoidable if one wanted to portray the conflict with any degree of accuracy. If Ridley had lingered upon it unnecessarily, that would be one thing, but he does not. He conveyed the violent injuries and conditions that both sides of the fight had to endure, without crossing into gratuitousness. People who have a low threshold for violence will probably cringe at many points during this movie - there are horrific injuries sustained on both sides of the fight. But it is not blood for blood's sake.<br />There are elements that were changed from the book, most of which seem reasonable due to time constraints and other restrictions. I think Ridley's depiction of the conditions in Mog (to my inexperienced eye) were probably fairly accurate; dirty, gritty, desperate, and cluttered. He didn't spend much time on the Somali side of the story, which was very noticable to me during the movie, and was something the book included quite a bit of. Again, issues of time constraints.<br />On the whole, I enjoy war movies. While I didn't \\"enjoy\\" this movie per se, I will see it again to soak up more details. It's an epic story about a handful of extraordinary men, heroes, and it deserves all of the attention it's been getting. There's no superfluous love story, and there's not much humor to lighten the mood; this is a tale about the realities of war. Ridley (and Bowden as well) has done the men involved a great honor by sticking to the facts as much as possible.
B000063COX|5.0|After years of line-up changing and a change or two in the band name, Iron Maiden went into the studio to record their debut album. Released in 1980, their self-titled debut CD started them on the road to success and legendary status as one of the pioneers of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal.<br />This album has a raw edge that is not seen on their later releases (maybe No Prayer For The Dying) and that makes it all the more better. With a more punk feel than the straight-forward metal they would come to write and record, this album is a classic and a great start for the band. Guitarist Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton deliver the songs wonderfully with the usual power chords and harmonic leads. Paul Di'Anno takes his spot before the microphone and belts out all the Maiden classics. While not being as powerful as Dickinson, Di'Anno is a great singer and his vocals mix well with the music. Steve Harris, yet again, has his way of making the bass heard and plays with the intensity that he has come to be known for. Behind the drums is Clive Burr, playing simple, solid and catchy beats that suit the raw power of each song.<br />The album begins with Prowler which is a really catchy song with some great guitar. Di'Anno's vocals are great on this song and Burr's drumming is wonderful. Sanctuary is a faster, more guitar driven track. Its got a punk feel with great rhythm and an awesome solo. Remember Tomorrow starts off slow and develops into a rocker. The vocals are great and the guitars are superb. Simply a classic song. Running Free is another awesome song because of the feel of the song. Each of the instruments are played incredibly well and the vocals are catchy. Phantom Of The Opera is another upbeat song, like Sanctuary. The guitar is great, the the overbearing presence of the bass midway through the track is amazing and the drumming is excellent. Transylvania is a fast-paced, guitar driven instrumental. The song is excellent with fast guitars and a well played rhythm. Strange World is a step away from the sound of the rest of the album and it soft and quiet straight through. Di'Anno's vocals shine and the solo is masterful. Charlotte The Harlot is punk-type song with a love-type theme. The song is fairly fast-paced until the song slows down and the guitar is more classical with the bass popping in and out. Incredible song. The last song, Iron Maiden, is a great closing song. Awesome guitars and bass with an extremely catchy chorus.<br />Iron Maiden's self-titled debut started their slow rise to the top, but they didn't really get started until Bruce Dickinson joined the band. But this is definitely an incredible start. Iron Maiden fans would be pleased and fans of punk-rock may like this as well. Its definitely something to check out.

0553260111|5.0|I read the original printing of this Robert Ludlum novel on a flight from London to Dallas and could not put it down.  I was exhausted when I got back for lack of sleep, but thrilled with the non-stop action that Ludlum provides.<br />After visiting many of the same locations that were written about in the novel, it was easy to picture the scenes in my mind.  But the real value of the book is the character development of Jason Bourne with the multiple twists and turns of the plot. A real page turner for even me...an avid non-fiction reader.<br />Bourne finds himself on a beach with amnesia...and must take the clues one by one to find out his true identity...and why assasins are chasing him.<br />I highly recommend this book for those that like intrigue and a good spy thriller.  The Bourne Supremacy is the sequel book...which is actually better than the Bourne Identity!

B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder's career spans several decades, but I think he hit his peak &quot;Songs in the Key of Life,&quot; &quot;Innervisions,&quot; and &quot;Talking Book.&quot;<BR>I remember buying &quot;Songs&quot; when it first came out in 1976, and I was amazed by the range of music on the album. To truly appreciate &quot;Songs,&quot; you have to listen to it from start to finish; it is a concept album that covers many musical styles, from R&amp;B, to funk, jazz, rock and soul. There are many hits on this album -- &quot;Village Ghetto Land,&quot; &quot;Sir Duke,&quot; &quot;I Wish,&quot; &quot;Isn't She Lovely,&quot; &quot;Another Star,&quot; as well as some lesser known tunes that are great, including &quot;Knocks Me Off My Feet,&quot; and &quot;I Am Singing.&quot; The musicians excel. <BR>Some of the lyrics are preachy, but you can tell that &quot;Songs&quot; is a personal statement, and that Wonder believes what he's preaching. <BR>The remastered CD sounds great, and I'm happy to report that all of the original liner notes are included. One of the top albums on the '70s, and essential for anyone's collection.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|Chances are if you've asked people if they've seen the movie &quot;Memento&quot;, they'd probably say no. That's because the movie never got a huge push and never made it to most of the theaters. But now, after the DVD premiered, the talk is going around: &quot;Memento&quot; is a new classic for thrillers today. Who would have ever thought of a movie that goes from the end to the beginning, and actually showing success? Guy Pearce is Leonard, a man that has a rare brain disorder that impairs his short term memory. Therefore, he won't remember anything that happened five minutes ago. Leonard is a widower trying to find out who killed his wife. He meets Natalie (Carrie Anne-Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). I can't tell you much about the plot because it would reveal too much! You learn more and more as you go into the movie, the more we go backwards into Leonard's life. No one seems to be who they really are. This film really makes you think, and in the end, you're really taken for a loop. &quot;Memento&quot; is one of these movies you have to see twice. Pearce is excellent, the suspense is there, and there is alot of suprise as well.
B00003CXXP|3.0|What a neat premise this movie came up with at the beginning: show us what turns life can take if a machine becomes truly intelligent and able to bear emotions. <br />But then the movie almost immediately starts to stomp on its own feet. Our hero, David, the first of the new robot generation able to handle emotions, is apparently not the first. Otherwise his predecessors would not be able to fear death, develop cynism beyond their limited programming or forget their programming at all. Best example here the lovebot \\"Gigolo Joe,\\" who tries to go undercover when he finds a dead woman in his apartment and later befriends David - all this goes far beyond \\"programmed reactions\\" as explained in the movie (why would the manufacturer program these into a lovebot at all?). Oh, and if you wonder how much thicker the plotline became due to \\"Gigolo Joe\\" imagine his role being deleted and try to think hard if he delivered anything useful.  <br />(Ok, I will *not* argue about the question why David gets shortfused when he eats spinach but can fall into a pool and nothing happens or why with all the elaborate technology to mimic humans none of the bots blink.)<br />Then we see David getting left by his mother (or the person he was programmed to love) and his endless quest to find the \\"Blue Fairy\\" from \\"Pinocchio\\" who he thinks can make him a real boy and win him the love of his mother. Did I say endless? Yes, because all of us past age 8 know that this quest will be futile. You may feel sorry for David, but you will also feel like watching an accident happen and you can do nothing about it. <br />But then enter Mr. Spielberg. When you watch the last 30 minutes of the movie you will know what I mean. You can almost tell where Kubrick's notes ended for sure and where Spielberg took what he described as \\"his own intellectual freedom.\\" At this point you will feel like watching \\"E.T.\\" and \\"2001\\" at the same time - on an LSD trip. Spielberg tried so hard to reach the heights of Kubrick(and had Williams throw in some \\"2001\\"-like tunes for the final) it is almost pitiful how he ruins his own ambitions with his pink popcorn attitude to sooth the viewer. Spielberg just can't let us go without a pat on the shoulder and a reassuring \\"everything will be fine!\\"<br />How swell would everything have been, if the movie ended right there with David staring and begging and Teddy eternally sitting with him. Audiences would have left the theaters wondering \\"are we aware of what a responsibility we are getting ourselves into there?\\" I would have even forgotten about the above mentioned implausibility of the emotional reactions the earlier robots had, which most likely were delivered to pull us onto the sides of the robots. <br />Which brings me to the one character I liked the best and felt genuinely sorry for: patient, enduring and quiet Teddy.
B000002N3J|4.0|This album is a random selection and has for sure an underrated quality compared to Madonnas greatest first albuns. Released in 1995, it is a mature collection of hybrids, containing mixed songs of Madonnas golden era.<BR>On this album we can listen to &quot;Rain&quot;, a highly listenable song that became an instant classic when the album &quot;Erotica&quot; was released in 1992. &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;, a mildly entertaining song, and &quot;Take a Bow&quot;, a song that really had a catchy hook, come from her &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;. &quot;Crazy for you&quot;, a beautifully done love song, comes from &quot;Immaculate&quot;( 1984 to mid-90`s), the album that contains the most essential hits, including her top singles.<BR>Always changing her shape, Maddona has always been a fable, a myth,and this album,an union of songs originally played in 80s and early-90s, had also an unsurprisingly sucess on sales.<BR>Unfortunately, this album can be consider incomplete because it doesnt contain daring move songs as &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; or signature songs as &quot;Material Girl&quot;, that spanned the decade and allowed a real craze of Madonna around the world.<BR>&quot;Music&quot; and &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, albums that kept Madonnas nose to the grindstone(of course more than &quot;Something to Remember&quot;, a collection of some old hits), didnt have the same effect of her previous albums, maybe because they are repetitive and dont have &quot;Papa dont preach&quot;, &quot;Live to tell&quot; or the magnificent &quot;Like a prayer&quot;, songs taht immortalized Madonna.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I believe that it's not fated for everyone to connect with this rich and overpowering record, but for those of us that truly do it's a lifelong experience.  Brian uses music to express the inexpressible, to communicate feelings and thoughts so profound that words can't get us there...Brian's astounding command of melody and the nuances of production captures the sadness and loss within the joyous experiences of life and the beauty within sadness and loss- a Proustian achievement that few other songwriters have dared attempt. Much has been said about &quot;God Only Knows&quot;, but &quot;Caroline, No&quot; may be the most beautiful song ever written. This record is a complete emotional experience in thirty minutes and change.  It is possibly the only album I've heard over a thousand times, and I hope I live to hear it a thousand more.
B000065U1N|5.0|War is [bad], and it will always be [bad] but this movie is anything but [bad]. I know that this was a real event and that people died and I mourn those who lost their lives but this movie is a MUST see. The movie features breath taking effects, outstanding sounds, and has a great overall physique. I have watched this movie 3 times at the thearters and it never gets old. If you are a person who loved \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Plat00n\\", then this is the next movie you will love.<br />To wrap all this into a couple of words... THIS IS A MUST SEE!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|One of the most innovative, original stories using a very innovative method of telling the &quot;story&quot;.  Memento was my hands down favorite for picture of the year last year.  I don't really like spoiling the story in movie reviews but if you like movies that make you think all the way through and enjoy great endings you have to at least watch this once.
B000051Y0G|5.0|Cyndi Lauper made a superlative record with \\"She's So Unusual\\".  The opening 6-song punch is breathtaking in its consistency and quality, and make this album a classic.  The remaining songs, while cute, are merely filler made charming by their association with such impressive material.  A closer look:<br />01.  Money Changes Everything;  Possibly Cindy's best song, definitely her most rocking one.  The lyrics are superb and the arrangement here is terse and harsh, as appropriate.<br />02.  Girls Just Want To Have Fun;  The classic that perfectly captured the artist's personality and image.  The MTV video is infamous.  Pure power pop and a pleasure to listen to.<br />03.  When You Were Mine;  a cover of the Prince song from his 'Dirty Mind' album.  Wonderful arrangement, excellent vocals.<br />04.  Time After Time;  one of the best ballads (or songs, for that matter) of the 80s, and a No. 1 smash.  Haunting lyrics, tortured vocals, and timeless production make this a standout.<br />05.  She-Bop;  A veiled ode to female self-gratification, this song is notable for its complex orchestration and very sexy vocals.<br />06.  All Through The Night;  The least of the 6 songs, this is another ballad, but not terribly distinguished.  Wonderful to listen to, though.<br />     This album ranks among my favourites simply because of the sense of FUN Cindy brings to the material and her delivery. Also recommended:  Twelve Deadly Cyns: And Then Some, for a hits collection (which also features the incredible \\"I Drove All Night\\").  This reissue contains 3 bonus tracks (live), all enjoyable, all not really necessary.
B00005QCVT|5.0|This must be one of the most overlooked, underrated movies of 2000. Director Darren Aronofsky and the cast of Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans did such a superb job in transfering the book to the screen.<BR>  \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is a movie about drug addiction. But its handling of the subject is so beautiful and poignant, and most importantly, REAL, that the film stands out among the countless other movies made about drugs.<BR>  One remarkable thing in the movie is the humanity of the characters. Though all 4 are drug addicts, they are not shaped simply by that fact. Instead they are portrayed as real people, deserving of dignity and all the dreams they hope for, who are destroyed by the evil that is addiction. It is a powerful message, because drug addicts are one of the most misunderstood and mistreated groups of people in our society.<BR>  The second aspect of the movie that deserves so much praise is the stunning audio/visual effect achieved by Aronofsky. He has the ability to turn a scene into an intense experience. His interpretation of the euphoria and hysteria brought about by drug abuse is wild; I loved it. <BR>  This movie brings you to 4 people who each have a dream, whether it be beauty, prominence, respect, or riches. But they are deceived into believing that drugs can realize these dreams, and this in turn brings their downfalls. Personally, I think the underlying message of this story is that we all need love. As you will see in the movie, each character was in need of some sort of validation as a human being. We all need to love each other, and above all love ourselves.
B00005R1N3|2.0|Black Christmas is another one of those movies that seems to have gained a reputation of being better than it actually is.<br />At a certain holiday (I won't spoil it for you) a group of sorority sisters is killed off one-by-one by a maniac who calls and breaths heavily into the phone.  Both Halloween and When a Stranger Calls took elements from this movie.  I'd rank this movie somewhere above Stranger and well below Halloween.<br />The one thing that separates Black Christmas from all the slashers that followed Halloween is the fact that these girls have a lot of depth.  They are not just given problems for the sake of having something to talk about.  The problems actually build character and figure into the main story.<br />The murders (the benchmark of all slasher movies) are creative if not suspenseful.  And the killer has as good a reason as any other I've heard for killing in these movies.<br />The Canadian DVD apparently has some things that the U.S. DVD doesn't, so if you really like the movie and want to make the extra effort try to find it instead. <br />Mildly recommended for historical value and Margot Kidder's performance.
B000006ZDR|5.0|... the mob rules!  This is way better than Heaven and Hell, and is the second to last great Sabbath album (preceding Born Again).  The title track rocks harder than anything they'd done in years.  This is Ronnie James Dio's second of three albums with the Sab, the third one being about a decade later with &quot;Dehumanizer&quot;, which is an okay record.  Dio tones down his Dungeons and Dragons themes slightly - but he still talks about &quot;I should be at the table round, a servant of the crown...&quot;, which is sort of silly but that was his thing.  Vinnie Appice (Carmine's brother) is a solid drummer and was, at that time, in much better shape than Bill Ward.  According to Kurt Cobain, Bill was in a mental institution around this time but he may have been lying.  Anyway.  Geezer's still in top form, check out the bass solo of &quot;Slipping Away&quot; and his lightning-fast hammer-ons in &quot;Falling off the Edge of the World&quot;.  Tony Iommi's solos on this record may very well be his best.  From the wah-wah excursions of &quot;Turn Up the Night&quot; to the soulful bends near the end of the title track to the frantic fretwork at the end of &quot;Over and Over&quot;, Iommi's leads are amazing.  The riffs are a bit darker than Heaven and Hell, which was more of a melodic album.  &quot;Country Girl&quot; is one of the heavier tracks and has a bridge that reminds the fans of Dio's love for &quot;Sailing&quot;  (which he mentions at least 3 or 4 times between this album and Heaven and Hell).  If you like this album you may like Born Again: Deep Purple's Ian Gillan replaces Ronnie James, and Bill Ward comes back for some reason.

0679777547|5.0|The Club Dumas is written for the true book-lover; for those who love the physicality of the novel as well as the knowledge it promises. Arturo Perez-Reverte?s novel delivers on its promise--it?s main character entertains while philosophizing on weighty subjects as morality, friendship, and love between shots of gin. Lucas Corso is a trader of books. While this man of wolf-like appearance and dizzying intellect will openly admit his sole purpose in the profession is for financial gain, it?s truly a veil for his true love: books. The 40-something Corso takes on the financially profitable and intellectually fascinating task of tracking down the only three copies of The Nine Doors, a text that supposedly has information necessary for summoning the devil. While the novel is as much a search for what many of the characters consider ultimate enlightenment (for the devil is associated with knowledge) as it is an exploration of Alexander Dumas? The Three Musketeers. From the start of the novel, Corso makes connections between his own experiences to those of Dumas? novel. This text-within-a-text becomes ironic, for the character Corso begins to question his own ?reality?; he questions whether he is a person or a character in a novel. Sometimes it?s hard to tell whether Perez-Reverte is parodying the often melodramatic cliffhangers common to serial novels such as Dumas?: (One example: ?[Corso] felt tender, like the soft center of a candy.) In general though, the writing is lucid, intelligent and at times, beautiful. The following is an example of Perez-Reverte?s precise prose, but it also speaks to all writers and all those who appreciate the written word: ?[Corso] was looking out the window at the streets and seemed to be searching in the night in the silent flow of car lights reflected in his glasses, for the lost word, the key to uniting all these different stories that floated like dead leaves on the dark waters of time? (107).
B00003CXTG|5.0|Pearl Harbor is not only a war movie, it's also a romance. For those who love romance, Pearl Harbor is a film that must have be seen. Despite the fact that the romance story is kind of predictable, it has a context that engages you. For the first 50 minutes of the movie it is an  inspiring love story, then amazing battle scenes sets the action. The fact that the cast is very young, acting in a wonderful place, gives the first part of the movie a romantic atmosphere that is drastically interrupted by the war. <br />   The second part of the movie showed the victims and nurses arriving at the hospital. Lots of soldiers arrived wounded by the war and the doctors and nurses had to select who they could help or not, what was doubly impressive. The view of that wonderful place destroyed by the war was horrible.<br />   The film has great special effects, when the attacks start you cannot see this without being overwhelmed by the horror of war. The special effects conveys how horrible the war is and the tragic deaths it causes.

B000002U9W|3.0|Hippies must LOVE the title track and roadie Allan's breakfast antics. Certianly this track is inventive and original. But from a musical standpoint it's pathetic.<br />However if you look at the filling on this sarnie you find:<br />If - Simple and catchy one of Roger's best pre-dark side offerings.<br />Fat Old Sun - Awesome track written by Gilmour as a follow up to Grandchester Meadows. The distortion on the guitar is what makes this song.<br />Summer '68 - Next to Paintbox this is Rick's finest hour. A genuinely catchy tune with an original idea of the chorus being Dave's distorted voice.<br />This album is worth having beacuse the 3 middle tracks are just so good (especially Summer'68). However the opener and ender are just Wayyyyyyyy too trippy for me.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Everybody who is anybody knows how outstanding the first two movies are. They are widely considered in many circles to be two of the ten greatest films ever made, and deservedly so. I mean, it actually merits the overused description of cinematic genius in every way, and absolutely nothing can reduce the scope of this brilliantly dark and legendary Sicilian saga. When I bought this set, I had extremely high hopes for their content, and I must say I was not at all disappointed. The movies look beautiful, the sound is crystal clear, and the features are damn good too. <br />From its incredible story to its artistic splendor to its career-launching performances, the original 'The Godfather' has everything that a truly great American gangster film should have. Marlon Brando, in the role of the aging Don Vito Corleone, is absolutely hypnotizing, in even the slightest mood or gesture. His prescence in unmistakeable. Of course, that doesn't at all undermine the heart and guts that Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and the rest of the cast put into their performances. It is all-at-once a story about family, as well as a sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America, with so many oft-quoted lines and instantly recognizeable scenes, undoubtedly one of the most startling and ingenious films Hollywood has ever seen. Whew! Now, it seems impossible, but 'The Godfather Part II' actually met the standard set by the original, some would say it even surpassed it. It serves as both a prologue and a sequel, masterfully intercutting between the rise of youthful Don Vito Corleone to Mafia chief in the early 1900s in the Little Italy section of New York City and the career of Corleone's son Michael in the late 1950s from his patriarchal prime to his decline a year later. Robert De Niro gives an uncommonly subtle performance as Vito Corleone, struggling to provide for his family in turn-of-the-century immigrant life, eventually finding himself lured into a life of crime. Al Pacino is staggeringly good once again as Michael, but probably the most overlooked performance is John Cazale as his pathetic and whimpering brother Fredo. His every word and mistake, is almost heartbreaking. 'Part II' is much more somber in its tone and almost feels like Greek tragedy, as Michael Corleone, knowing it is his destiny to lead the family, inevitably finds himself unable to come to grips with his demons, leaving him contemplative and spiritually-broken. If that doesn't give you chills and make you say \\"Dayyyum!\\" then you just don't understand great poignant art. As for 'The Godfather Part III'. Ah, I don't know, it's good, and I suppose it is somewhat underrated. After all, living up to the standard set by the first two is a damn-near impossible feat. Andy Garcia and Bridget Fonda both turn in good work, and Sofia Coppola isn't nearly as bad as she has been made out to be. There are a few memorable scenes and Pacino did give us one of the most oft-quoted lines of the '90s (\\"Just when I thought I was out... they pulled me back in.\\") but it was just bookending it too quickly.<br />I'm very happy with this set, and I think the film company did a beautiful job in their presentation of this trilogy. I particularly liked watching the Oscar acceptance speeches. Coppola is such an exuberant and excitable fella, its hard to believe a seemingly-regular person was the driving force behind these two larger-than-life masterpieces. I do think its kind of odd that neither of the two actors that won Oscars for any of the films, were present to accept their award at the Academy Awards telecast of 1972 and 1974. That really makes me wonder, because it seems that rarely happens anymore. Alright, I think I've said enough now, so I'll end by saying that this set is definitely worth what they're charging (an arm and a leg), because this trilogy belongs in even the most casual film fans' collection.
B00002E285|2.0|An overhyped load of rubbish. A bad \\"visualisation\\" of the album and stage shows. Bob Geldoff is excellent as Pink. But this is the only good part about this film.<br />It certianly makes the story easier to understand than it's album and stage show predacessors. However it's shoddily done and all the acting with the exception of Geldoff is hammier than a pig sty.<br />Also several tracks are edited or just completely left out of the film. The keyboard solo from Run Like Hell is absent and Hey You isn't even used!. <br />I have a lot of respect for all three of the individuals responsible for this flick. But the love child of their often unfriendly affair is nothing more than an overhyped musical that tries to be as gruesome and cold as it possibly can.<br />Stick with the studio album or even better the BRILLIANT Is There Anybody Out There? live album.
0061020710|5.0|I am on my fourth Discworld novel now and I have to say that the first has been the best so far. It is a little hard to follow in the beginning but that's not a problem once you get into it. It has the second best set of characters that I have read so far (I like the characters in Equal Rites more, somehow) and it really does make you laugh outloud at times. If, like me, you appreciate book cover art, then search for the Corgi books edition. The covers are so much nicer than the bland Harper Prism edditions.
B00004SVIK|5.0|Now THIS is The Wall as it was intended. A spectacle and a half it is pure genius. <br />The original studio album for The Wall was always good (if a little OVERhyped). But it is left standing looking at the dust of this far superior rendition.<br />Atmosphere just OOZES off this concert. And while other Floyd/Waters live concert albums such as P.U.L.S.E and In The Flesh are good albums. They lack a great deal of atmosphere. This doesn't!. The whole thing translates brilliantly.<br />It's interesting listening to songs such as &quot;Is There Anybody Out There?&quot; which now have a completely different context to them than they had on the album.<br />The ONLY wild card here is Comfortably Numb which isn't as good as it's studio counterpart. However everything else is better than the album and Run Like Hell and Hey You burry the renditions from later tours.<br />This is a MUST HAVE album.
0930289455|4.0|The Killing Joke is one of the few Batman stories where you actually feel for the Joker as a character. In most stories he either comes off as a charicature of a killer or a sinister and dispicable murderer who you can't have any sympathy for. One of Alan Moore's masterpieces, it even has a song that you can sing. Its funny, but the tune just comes to your head. You automatically know how you should be singing it. The pacing is very cinematic and it is not overburdened with words. Wordless captions make the story more fast paced.<BR>Bolland (why doesn't he do more interiors these days?) is the best Joker (and Batman) artist of all time. The expressions of dispair that he draws on the faces of Barbara Gordon, the Joker, Commissioner Gordon and others are among the most realistic I have ever seen.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Cheap, Cheap, Cheap, too CHEAP to put on scene seletion. Don't buy this if you need scene selection get a VHS or a CVD instead.<BR>As for the movie I started it twice but never finished it, I'm tossing it instead.
0440219078|4.0|This was a good book, but slightly disturbing at times. The end is suspenseful. This book is full of suprises, but they are sometimes given away by foreshadows... but overall, it's a pretty good book!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|So few movies today actually engage your mind and emotions.  Most merely stimulate your senses.  Not so this nifty little thriller.  This movie requires you to pay attention and it draws you into its interesting story using a bizzarre backwards narrative structure that puts you in the same state as the memory-impared protagonist.<br />The only failure this movie has is that by being so creative in structure, it somehow fails to engage the emotional side of the story.  Still, any movie that can actually be logical and consistent and still require the full attention of the viewer to comprehend is worthy of note.  There are moments of violence, but nothing gratuitous.  The most remarkable scene is the one where Carrie-Anne Moss reveals her true nature and intentions to the hero, knowing he will forget in a few minutes.  It is a fine piece of acting in a remarkable piece of filmmaking.
0060925000|4.0|I will be brief and merely add some comments to the many reviews already written on this book. First of all, I think it is a very good book, but definitely not for everyone. If you're thinking about reading it, you're probably wondering if it's worth the effort of investing in such a long undertaking. Here are some suggestions:<br />If you are yourself Indian and/or interested in India, especially early post-independence Indian history, then you will probably find this a very interesting read. Vikram Seth manages to pack an extraordinary amount of historical, economic, social and cultural detail in his novel, which is, after all, essentially a love story. But it is also a story about -- not just set in -- India. If you have no interest in India or Indian culture (or Pakistan and sub-continental Muslim culture), you will likely be confused by many words and references, and you should keep away from this book.<br />Likewise, if you are interested in Hindu-Muslim relations, Seth does a good job at highlighting some of the key issues and the different ways some Hindus and Muslims look at the same issues. In this, it is amazing to compare what he wrote about the 1950s with the situation in India today. You can't understand what's going on in India today without a good dose of history, and Seth knows that.<br />Well, what if you're not really one way or the other as regards Indian history and culture, but you like big family dramas? This book is also for you. Seth has so much compassion for his characters, that you will find it very hard not to empathize with at least several of them. Moreover, he injects a great deal of humor into the book. It is a book about people, about life -- in all its aspects, about death, about family, and more.<br />However, on the down side, Seth's writing style leaves a bit to be desired. He is no James Joyce, no Faulkner. Although at times his prose does achieve something close to poetry (Seth is originally a poet), these instances are very rare indeed. Usually at dramatic moments, I felt he was trying too hard. At other times, I found his prose simply pedantic -- not awful, just not very good. So ask yourself, how much do you care about really good writing? Most people don't care. For me, it matters a great deal, and proved a slight obstacle in enjoying this book.<br />However, on the whole for me, the good outweighed the bad. For many people, this will be a highly enjoyable and heart-warming read. But don't take my word for it -- you can read the first 20 pages and see for yourself. You'll get the tone and style of the book right away. It doesn't change after that.
B00000DFTG|4.0|Black Sabbath Reunion isn't perfect, but neither is Black Sabbath anymore. They're 50 and did this tour as a crowd pleaser effort which this album of tracks definitely is.<br />Ozzy's voice isn't what it used to be and that is to be expected.<BR>The years of drug abuse and hard touring have taken it's toll on Ozzy's vocals. What wasn't expected is the unbridled energy of the whole band. It's clear that they didn't do this tour just for the money. Iommi is a wonder and Butler is nothing short of astounding in his playing. Ward's a bit weaker, but considering his recent health problems it's amazing that he's keeping up at all. Make no mistake though, he is competent in his duties.<br />The best thing about this collection is that it is an accurate document of the accompaning tour. It was a thrill to hear the original band playing together again after all these years and this collection of songs is a great souvenir of those events.<br />The additional tracks are incidental to all of this and although decent, they are completely overshadowed by the historic nature of the live material. Perhaps if the band released a new album they would carry more weight.
B000060P79|5.0|I just saw Simple Plan concert in March when they opened for Sugar Ray and I have to say that they are the best band ever! I have their cd and listen to it all the time. Their music isn't fake or superficial, but has to do with real issues that real kids face when they are or were in high school. They have a great sound and really know how to make some good music that is awesome to listen to and actually has some meaning to it. I would definitely reccomend this CD to anyone who likes to listen to music that has substance. It is a great cd that can make you appreciate the good times.
0345440900|3.0|Friends gave us a copy of this book after having our first child. And, as I am of all books that steal their titles from something else, I was a bit wary of this book. And, now I see there are already follow up books \\"baby whisperer for toddlers\\" and so on. Pretty soon there will be a whole like of \\"whisperer\\" books by Tracy Hogg...Yikes! <br />First off, I would just say that I found nothing in the book about the author's background. That always makes me a little nervous. Sure, moms know a lot about raising children, but is it enough to be a parent of a couple children to be considered an \\"expert.\\" <br />The second thing that bothers me about this book is that I found the voice of the writing to be a bit smug. I cannot remember right off, but she uses words like \\"dear\\" and so on. That's might be because she's English. Its annoying.<br />That aside, there are some useful charts and such in the book, but I do not see it as the \\"breakthrough\\" book that everyone says it is. There are plenty of other books on sleep and babys from people such as Sears out there that can bring you the same results.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is a monument in rock history as a work of both structured and spontaneous instrumentation, and of course, a concept album.  It is indeed a production masterpiece, with so many musical elements and distinctly great songs, even as they blend so well into a unified work.  The verselines are more easygoing, the instrumentation varied, more often with a sort of jazzy or jazz/rock feel, occasionally with good rock soloing--check out David Gilmour's guitar in \\"Time\\" and \\"Money,\\" for example, the latter of which is the \\"normal\\" rock song.<br />The overall theme is difficulty and madness in everyday life.  Pink Floyd is comprehensive in addressing subthemes of troubling aspects of human relations and existence:  aging and death, greed and corruption, hate and war, and of course, \\"lunacy.\\"  This is set against a backdrop that seems to constantly emphasize isolation in vast spaces.  Look at those broad, elaborate images in the song titles:  air, time, sky, color, the moon (the sun is subordinated, appearing in the song lyrics only ephemerally).  The music is usually distant, often softly sweeping and otherworldly, filling all surrounding horizons.  Actually, in only parts of this album does one feel as if there is ground below.<br />The human side of things is also in the song titles:  speaking, breathing, money, brains, companionship (OK, time qualifies here too).  Then the sound effects:  the album begins and ends with a heartbeat, no less.  The cash register before \\"Money,\\" the clock before \\"Time,\\" we are being taken on a trip in which all the tracks neatly flow into the next, punctuated by a consistently somber mood and usually soft, smooth vocals, Gilmour's being the most so and the most prominent.  Roger Waters kicks in at the end in \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse.\\"<br />But, hey, \\"Dark Side\\" is a production masterpiece for its great music, first and foremost.  Was so much ever combined within 43:01, so many different musical elements, so skillfully?Listen to that vibrating, circular synthesizer that makes up \\"On the Run.\\"  Listen to Dick Parry's jazz saxophone in \\"Money\\" and Richard Wright's beautiful piano work in \\"The Great Gig in the Sky,\\" in which Clare Torry's rangy vocals accentuate and contribute to a compellling mood.  The percussion:  Yes to the Roto-toms of Nick Mason leading into the verse on \\"Time.\\"<br />It is the beautiful \\"Us and Them\\" that is Dark Side's finest moment, with its stunningly exquisite, gorgeous texture.  Wright and Parry carry the day, while the chorus ladies  contribute a majestic background as the melody is crescendoed into dramatic cadences.  The great synthesizer work of \\"Any Colour You Like\\" then leads to \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse,\\" the finale, as sweeping music mirrors Waters' all-encompassing chants about all aspects of life and existence that are then ultimately ... I won't tell.
B00005JKJA|4.0|Knowing David Lynch you have to expect weird but interesting plotts, but this one tops the cake. Mulholland Drive jumps from charector to charector, leaving pieces out along the way, and dumping them at you at the end. This movie made about 40% sense, this was at the end of the movie. Lynch makes you, at the end of Mulholland Drive, wonder what this and that ment. I think that was the point of it. This movie made 'Blue Velvet' as easy to understand as a Disney movie. I was stuck for hours after this film wondering what it all ment. and then it hit me. See Mulholland Drive to find out the 'twist' ending.
B000002UAF|5.0|A Hard Day's Night is the acme of The Beatles' early period, the strongest pre-Sergeant Pepper album.  Perhaps not lyrically, but the song quality is something else--it is hard to imagine a greater collection on a non-Greatest Hits recording. <br />Along with the superb, rhythmic title cut, the strongest track lyrically and musically is Paul's lovely \\"Things We Said Today.\\"  It is a whispered ode to romance, alternating between a softer verse and a livelier chorus.  It is one of Paul's best songs ever, but he also contributes big time with the beautiful ballad \\"And I Love Her\\" (sort of reminiscent of \\"P.S. I Love You\\") and the Beatles classic antimaterialistic rocker \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\"<br />John matches Paul for beauty with the wonderful \\"If I Fell,\\" a tribute to the desire for truth and meaningfulness in love.  Also absolutely excellent is John's \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" in which he observes love is realization.  George's \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance with You\\" is an equally strong entry.  This pretty number avoids possible syrupiness with fast-paced beat and verse.<br />There is nothing resembling a wasted cut among the 13 songs (except perhaps \\"When I Get Home\\"), each of which was written by the group.  \\"Anytime at All\\" is in the typical Beatles vein of romance employing steady rhythm, while \\"You Can't Do That\\" is a little offbeat for the Beatles, no pun intended.  It sounds like it was written by one of the groups the Beatles used to cover (Smokey Robinson?), but it is top notch, a cocky statement accompanied by clever, snappy lead guitar lines.  \\"Tell Me Why\\" and \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" show John telling about a woman and man crying, respectively, but both are good rock and roll numbers, no cloyed excesses (altho there is that falsetto line on the former).  Also not syrupy is Paul's pretty \\"I'll Be Back,\\" with a sort of western flavor in the chorus line.<br />Still, this terrific record is most memorable for the classic title cut, the working man's passion for thebetter part of the day (night), with its strong rhythmic verseline and great guitar riff in the chorus, which also features Paul in one his sexiest moments.  The Beatles certainly held tight in this excellent collection, which is as good as it gets.
B00000AFFI|5.0|P.J Harvey's music is very mature,diffrent and...interesting; most of the songs are built in a story form and you can really see and feel the characters in these stories through P.J's 'oh so unique' voice which always changes to match the mood.<BR>\\"Angelene\\" is beautiful,i bet every woman on this planet can relate to it and every man can understand her situation.it's a very touching track.\\"A Perfect day Elise\\" is sooo up-lifting it makes you wanna dance and it's also seductive(in my POV anyway!).<BR>in \\"Catherine\\" you can really feel the desire,wanting and mostly the obssession. some songs are really edgy (like \\"Joy\\",\\"Elise\\" \\"Leah\\" \\"No girl so sweet\\")<BR>and some are really smooth & full of desire (like \\"The Wind\\").<br />There's no mention about love in this CD (something that i think is good...with all do respect,i'm tired of these stupid pop love songs) and so the album's title really summs up the feeling in the songs,it's about a woman who's been through alot of stuff and asking herself if Desire is enough to lift her up.maybe she'll find the answer after expirencing love?who knows.<BR>(anyway, great album-buy it,now!)
B000002UA9|5.0|The Beatles' first LP was a breathtaking introduction--OK, some of these cuts were big hits that had already been given a lot of radio airplay, but this album showed that a group could release an LP that was not made up mostly of filler surrounding a few big hits.  The Beatles could and always did.  While they played covers frequently in their early days, some of which are included here, their own compositions far outdid their renditions of hits of other performers.<br />The two exceptions were \\"Twist and Shout\\" and \\"Boys.\\"  In the former, John displayed the power and range of his harmonic vocal abilities, in a song that became such a Beatles trademark that many thought it was written by them even as the Isley Brothers had made it famous.  Ringo also excels in \\"Boys,\\" an unusual number that has him singing about female attraction to men rather than the other way around, accompanied by fast-paced guitar and dynamic bass and drums.<br />The opener, \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" is a quintessential dancing tune, complementing \\"Twist and Shout\\" nicely, and is one of the Fab Four's all-time greats.  It is less explosive but more steady-driven, with Paul's great bass lines and chorus.  The Beatles' first hit, \\"Love Me Do,\\" is also included, certainly richer in simple melody than lyrics.  Paul's precious \\"P.S. I Love You\\" gives a hint of things to come from him.  It is cloyed but with complete justification, for everything works perfectly.  George is similarly cloyed in \\"Ask Me Why\\" and \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\" (more in the former), but The Beatles' songs are just so good that this aspect is always largely compensated automatically.  Not cloyed and one of the all-time greats is the title cut, showing the rhythmic style and strength that characterized so many of the group's smash hits in the early period, including \\"She Loves You\\" and I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\"
B000001EHS|5.0|These guys have so many great songs that this collection could easily have been a 2-disc set.  There are 15 songs from 1981-95.  There is stuff here from every album up through '95, except for their first album &quot;On Through The Night&quot;.  All are original full-length studio tracks except for 'Rocket', which is the shortened radio/video version.(still good)  Also here is the radio/video version of 'Sugar', the only difference is the intro to the song, which is different from the version on &quot;Hysteria&quot;.  I always wanted that version, so I thought it was cool that they put it in this collection.(both versions are great)  If you remember the good ol' days of listening to the radio and watching MTV, these songs will be instantly recognizable.  Also included is a previously unreleased song 'When Love And Hate Collide' which should have been a huge hit.  This CD is chocked full of classic Leppard, a true enjoyment to listen to over and over again.  I simply cannot recommend this one enough, so if you don't have it, do yourself a monster favor and get it.  ROCK ON!
B00003CXZ1|4.0|A kudos for Tomb Raider. Although I agree completly with what other reviewers have said about the production, direction and acting in this movie, I found that it works out, plot notwithstanding, as a very entertaining piece of action/adventure. The only problem refering to Angelina Jolie in this film is that her real father plays her father as well (John Voigt). The resemblance is uncanny, although the features really work out much better for Angelina than for her dad!. He probably won't be in the sequels, which is a plus, since I won't have to worry so much about doppleganger effects.
B00005JKDR|5.0|As many reviewers have said, Pixar recent fourth hit has made a homerun! After making movies \\"A Bug's Life\\", \\"Toy Story\\", and \\"Toy Story II\\", Pixar and Disney hits it off big with \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"<br />Children have always been afraid of monsters in their closet. They never realize what an important role they play in keeping the city of Monstropolis running. 'Monster Incorporations' is the corporation which 'takes and stores' 'scream energy'. Hiring a different assortment monsters to scare children to use their screams as energy to power up the whole of Monstropolis, 'Monsters Inc.' is a very powerful company. Until recently when the head of the company, Waternoose (James Coburn), finds out that the business is not doing well. Things get worse when top scare-er James P. \\"Sulley\\" Sullivan (John Goodman) gets involved in a situation where a young girl, named 'Boo' (Marry Gibbs), comes from the real world into the monster's world. She immediately attaches herself to Sulley who promptly asks for help from his best friend and assistant, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). Can they keep the 'Child Detection Crew' from finding Boo? And can they make sure she gets home before monster rival to Sulley, Randall (Steve Buscemi) has his evil plans for Boo completed? Also starring is Celia (Jennifer Tilly) as Mike's girlfriend whom he's madly in love with, Roz (Bob Peterson) the cantankerous, stubborn, and strict worker at Monster's Inc., and Fungus with the voice of Frank Oz.<br />A most entertaining and hilarious movie, the perfect to movie to spend time watching with the family. The whole idea of \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" is very original and interesting. From 'scream energy' to Monstropolis, from Child Detection Agency to closet doors being the doorway between the real world and the monster's world. The CG was excellent also, from the quality of Sulley's fur to Mike's eye, everything is well done making everything seem so real. One point I liked best was Randall, the whole idea of him being able to blend in to his surroundings and 'disappear' is pretty freaky for even older kids! Two thumbs up for fantastic work. Pixar also made very good choices for the voice talents of Sulley and Mike. John Goodman I have heard as Pacha in \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\". But never have I heard Billy Crystal's voice in any animation movie and you've got to admit, he's VERY GOOD at it! Just listening to him makes me laugh, always reminding me of his role as 'Miracle Max' in \\"The Princess Bride\\" (one of my all-time favorite movies).<BR> <BR>But one of the main things I loved about the movie is the well-done script. There are some very obvious jokes while some very subtle and witty humor is put in, making the movie very enjoyable for adults, too. One of the funniest things I liked about the movie is Celia's... hair. She's a monster of course and her hair is actually many snakes so the ends of her hair are snakes heads. And when she gets angry, you can see some tail ends 'rattling' making a rattlesnakes noise! I thought that was VERY hilarious and I was laughing so hard! Also another favorite part of mine is where Sulley is being attacked by Randall and Mike has NO clue to what's going on! <br />And of course, no one can miss any of the bloopers at the end of the movie. And still even after that, we get to see a very funny 'Broadway musical' (I forgot the name though I know that even just hearing it makes you laugh!). Then keep going to the very end of the film where you can read, \\"No monsters were harmed in the making of this movie.\\" :-) Then there's the very beginning of the movie, before the story starts, you can watch Oscar-Award winning short film \\"For the Birds\\". It just simply cracked me up! The birds were so funny!<br />So if I STILL haven't convinced you to see this film, I don't know what else to say but, \\"you're missing out on one of the best family films ever.\\" I know I'll be making sure to get the DVD when it comes out which is jam-packed with special features!
0767802659|5.0|THis is a great testorone flick. The action is fast-paced, the dialogue campy, the enemy is one everyone can hate and the hero is a big dumb handsome guy, just like me!!<BR>The earth has been unified under a quasi-military regime that has brought stability, peace and space travel. During these travels, we encounter the BUGS, space-voyaging insects. Inevitably, the two cultures clash inan interstellar war. The story, from Heinlein's book, focuses on a small group of Space Marines and their battles with the bugs. The film deviates from the book, with the addition of a love interest, but that's ok. <BR>The film spawned a series, Roughnecks, that may be even better, story-wise, than the film.
0553296981|2.0|Basic story of survival is always challenging and inspirational. I tried to place myself as a character in the book and could not.  At one point I wanted to scream &quot;LOOK IN THE CLOSET!&quot;<br />Maybe it's me,but the book was pretty predictable.
0790729628|5.0|In the future, the world has become a giant melting pot with all of humanity crushed together into a few megapolises, speaking a hybird language. Off-world has become a dream for some, a nightmare for others, suitable for a few, including androids and clones.<BR>These clones are no better than slaves, with a limited life span so they don't get any ideas about freedom. A ragtag rebel band escapes and returns to earth, only to be hunted down by Ford, a burned out cop who questions everything, including his own value. <BR>Hauer is fantastic as the leader of the clone group. He tries to discover his death date, yet dreads doing so and in the last moments of his life, saves Ford from falling. Life is precious for everyone.<BR>This film is terrific with a modern worning for researchers who want to clone humans, or anything, for medical purposes. When does a clone become human? Does a clone, one created and born in mechanical devices, qualify for the same rights and respect as we do? Troubling questions which aren't answered in this film because they can't be answered. And I hope they never need to be.
6305268843|5.0|I have not even finished Firelight as yet, but I am so entranced with its story and actors that I felt I must write this now.<br />There is a scene in the film when Dillane's character sees Sophie's character come through the doorway that is heart stopping. These two actors suck all the air out of the room, and I was left breathless from the scene. It is very rare to get that reaction in film.  The direction, lighting, camera work, and actors must be in complete alignment.<br />I will treasure that scene.<br />I agree with whomever wrote that a hunk would have lost the delicate balance that these two extraordinary actors bring to their scenes.<br />But what I really like as a woman viewer...Sophie is partially nude and so is Stephen.<br />It makes it so fair to the actress. It reminded me of the careful handling of actors in The Piano.<br />I love this film.  No matter how it ends, I love this film.
B00005JKYS|5.0|This movie is tops. It has it all. Truth, honor, comradie, bravery, and the horor of war. This is the first Vietman movie that I have seen that depicts the American Soldier as someting other than drug users, rapists, or murders. Truly a remarkable movie.
B00004TVGF|4.0|This performance claims to be &quot;legendary&quot;, and while I'm not so sure about that part, I was nevertheless extremely impressed with the performance. The orchestral accompaniment is close and intimate, consisting of only 2 violins, a cello, a double bass and a chamber organ. Sebastian Hennig's treble voice is simply sublime and his skill and control excellent, while Rene Jacobs has a very strong counter-tenor voice well suited to this piece. The only criticism was that on some tracks the vocals were too loud compared to the orchestral parts, although this is highly subjective and depends on your speakers as well. Highly recommended.
B00005JKQX|3.0|I have always believed Ron Howard is the kind of film director who makes movies that touch our hearts.  His works always makes us feel good.  \\"Cocoon\\", \\"Backdraft\\", \\"Willow\\" -all these films are fine examples of Howard's abilitites to manipulate our feelings.  Hey, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a trait which is very essential on him and his movies.<br />When I started watching \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", I found myself watching what might be Ron Howard's first attempt to make something serious.  The real story of John Forbes Nash, Jr. is quite gripping.  And his fight to overcome schyzophrenia is quite attractive because he watches some sort of ghosts or imaginary people who are product of his problem.  Russell Crowe's performance is one of a kind and makes the rest of his castmates, especially Jennifer Connelly, perform in a very fantastic way.  Ed Harris seems to be the only one wasted as one of Nash's \\"ghosts\\".<br />As I said before, this is Ron Howard's first attempt at serious filmmaking.  However, his formulaic pattern becomes noticeable at the final fifteen minutes when Nash's wife gives her total support in one of the most unnecessarily romantic moments of the movie.  And the Nobel Prize ceremony scene is disappointing because it shows Howard's way of finding an easy conclusion to a very tough drama by giving his audience a way to feel sorry and weep for Crowe's character.  But, hey, this is supposed to be a Ron Howard film.
B00003CXXP|5.0|For me, this is , without a doubt, Mr. Spielberg's<BR>most accomplished film since Jaws. In terms of <BR>substance and emotional intensity, A.I. does indeed<BR>surpass his admittedly entertaining debut. Many of <BR>his films since Jaws have struck me as very<BR>heavy-handed. Here, his technical proficiency is at<BR>last matched by content.It is a unique, thought-provoking film that is very engaging while at the same time slightly disturbing. He has even managed to<BR>imbue the film with an interesting Kubrick flavor, and I think Mr. Kubrick would have been pleased with the finished product. The Williams score adds quite a bit, as usual, and the acting is first rate. Master Osment is perfect,<BR>and Jude Law is, I think, actually a machine. A<BR>must-see, unforgettable film. The DVD is superlative.<BR>Check it out.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|she is definitely perfect for the role of Lara Croft, and she did a fantastic job in the movie...and I'm not even a fan of hers.<br />BUT, BUT, BUT...all the other actors in this movie just couldn't keep up with her.  They fail to support her role.  In the end, I was dissappointed with the movie because coz of all the bad acting from them.
B000000ZKD|5.0|I really do love the Beatles, and every little bit of what they do, but Booker T &amp; the MGs' cover of Abbey Road stands on its own legs.  It is an album you will play 3 times for every time it occurs to you to play Abbey Road. If you like the Beatles, this an album you will want to own, and if you like Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Al Jackson, Jr., and Donald Dunn (yes, &quot;Duck&quot;), you will be glad you own this CD.  Either way, get this one.
B00003CY6M|4.0|I thought this movie was very sweet and enjoyable.
B00001NFCY|2.0|There seems to be some controversy over whether &quot;Human Clay&quot; is better than Creed's first album, &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, with the majority view being that the first album employed less sophisticated production techniques.<br />Nonetheless, the difference between the two seems minimal to me.  If you like pounding guitars and vocals that sound like Pearl Jam, you'll probably like this again. In particular, &quot;Faceless Man&quot; is a reasonably good song.<br />For what it's worth, I liked the first album marginally better, and wish I'd saved my money.
B00005NI5Y|4.0|I am 54 years old and am familiar with about 75% of Bob Dylan's albums since his second album, &quot;Freewheelin.'&quot; After about 10 listenings I am prepared to comment on the current one.  In the first place, as Joe Walsh said in an interview on &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, Dylan proves again that he &quot;can still rock.&quot;, particularly on &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; and &quot;Honest With Me&quot;.  Other than that, with certain reservations which I can discuss, &quot;Love and Theft&quot; compares most favorably with &quot;New Morning&quot; with its abundance of blues and country imagery.  There is even a love song similar to &quot;Winterlude&quot;--&quot;Moonlight&quot;.  The imagery on &quot;Love&quot; however is more complex--but it comes down to &quot;New Morning&quot; in the end.  The reservations I have is that Dylan expresses considerable frustration on &quot;Love &amp; Theft&quot; but this is in fact part of the blues genre, and perhaps not so surprising after all.  He has a lot of bad memories, it seems; he &quot;stayed in Mississippi a day too long&quot; and if you look closely there are instances of frustration in most of the songs.
B00005JKJA|3.0|The film is great.  Read the other reviews for testimonials.  There were two things which disappointed me about this dvd: 1) there are no chapter stops.  Not one.  I understand the argument of how the movie should be viewed in its entirety and all, but, practically, it's very annoying.  2) one scene has been censored, resulting in some very obvious blurring.  There are, of course, no extras besides the trailer, but I guess that's pretty standard for Lynch.  We're just lucky it's on dvd.
B00005AXEL|5.0|Trouble in Shangri La is Stevie's best CD to date! Her best since Bella Donna. It's a shame she didn't win a Grammy for this, she really deserved one - unfortunately the Grammys don't acknowledge anyone with a true talent.<BR>Having received an advanced copy of Sheryl Crow's new CD and after listening to her version of It's Only Love, it doesn't compare with Stevie's. I am anxiously waiting for the new Fleetwood Mac CD - it will be like Buckingham Nicks all over again....congratulations Stevie!
B00005JKBC|3.0|This movie has been one of the best spy movies to come out in the last 5 years.  But the DVD had problems, I dont know if it was with my DVD player or it was the DVD, but my version of this movie kept popping up the damn english captions.  It was a huge pain, I tried putting it in my iBook but the same problem came up.  I have no idea what the problem was, but that is why I only gave it 3 stars.
B000000I0Q|4.0|Steve Hackett's first solo album, a largely instrumental group of songs, remains something incredible, almost 30 years after its release. <BR>     The tracks on this disc are predominantly instrumentals, featuring lots of trademark Hackett guitar leads as well as some delicious synth playing and acoustic guitar. &quot;Ace of Wands&quot; is a magnificent mini-epic full of outstanding playing, memorable compostition and perfect instrumentation. &quot;Hand of the Priestess&quot; pats 1 and two as well as &quot;the Lovers&quot; are soft, pastoral pieces featuring delicate acoustic guitar and superb flute leads. &quot;The Hermit&quot; and the &quot;Star of Sirius&quot; feature vocals by Phil Collins and Hackett himself. &quot;Star&quot; has particularily impressive guitar/mellotron textures accompanied by synth and vibes, which border on spacey at times.<BR>     &quot;Shadow of the Hierophant,&quot; the disc's lengthy closer is a very nice operatic sort of tune featuring vocals of that style by Sally Oldfield. The epic fadeout of the song is not to be missed, but it drags on for far too long, which explains the detraction of a star. &quot;A Tower Struck Down&quot; is the only tense song on this otherwise mellow, often pretty collection of songs.<BR>     Fans of Hackett's later work will find this somewhat different from his other material, but most of his followers as well as fans of early Genesis and prog in general will find this incredibly melodic album a real treat.
0312243022|4.0|Michael Cunningham should be a Pullitzer Prize winner for the stunning words in this novel. Scenery, dialogue and inner thoughts are so aptly described. I was drawn to the prose. <br />My friends all loved the book. They recommended it so many times, I purchased a copy and dug in. I'm sorry to say I had to force myself through the stories, though. Each woman in the book was an interesting person unto herself, but goodness, I just couldn't love them. Tying them together at the end seemed trite. I would have been satisfied with the three different stories that only linked with the Virginia Woolf book. <br />I wanted to love it. I loved the prose, but just didn't love the story. I'm still giving it four stars for the writing, but the missing star is reserved for my personal satisfaction with the story. Sorry.
B0000508U6|1.0|First let me start out by saying that I absolutely love Travis, Radiohead, and Starsailor.  Now, a lot of people will tell you that Coldplay is exactly like them.  DON&quot;T LISTEN.  Coldplay is very bad.  Sure, Yellow is a great song, but for me, that's where it ends.  The music is very boring and just...doesn't sound good.
B000002TP7|5.0|One Liners? Yes, such as, &quot;The phone is ringing, oh my God!&quot; and, &quot;Ok, Ok, let's take it from here!&quot; and, &quot;Alright, you're scratching right now, but don't try this at home on your dad's stereo, only under hip-hop supervision.&quot; Okay, maybe I'm the only person that quotes lyrics from songs, but, this CD especially,I just can not help it! I originally bought this based on only one track, Get It Together, when it was first released, cause that song is totally off the hook and I had to have a copy of my own to play at will...but when I took the time to listen to the album in its entirety, I began to play the CD on a ongoing basis, as one of the soundtracks to my life as a movie of the week. However, in the event, your need for music is not that dramatic, you should still have this CD, it will improve your image when played on a good system with the volume up. And when you are not sure what to jam, don't worry its perfect music for every occasion, okay, alright, one little exception, when grandma comes to visit, you may turn it down a bit. Last, but not least, the following songs deserve special mentioning: Get It Together, Alright Hear This, Flute Loop, Heart Attack Man, Scoop, but you decide which are your favorite off this recording and if you weren't before, this is the album that will make you a total Beastie Boys fan. Now how could you not want to buy it, with satisfaction guaranteed personally, by yours truely, (that's me)the One Woman Riot!
B00005NW02|3.0|I love the song Chop Suey!  So, I was on the fence about buying the CD.  Frankly, Chop Suey! is a kick-butt song.  The rest of the CD is filled with very heavy riffs and deep, dark lyrics.  Unfortunately, none really seem to catch the same harmonic style of Chop Suey!  <br />If you love hardcore - this is your album of the year.  Others might want to listen before buying.
0425173755|4.0|The novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie, is a riveting and impelling book which chronicles the adventures of a adroit detective traveling on an unusually crowded train, The Orient Express, at the time of a murder.  When this detective, M. Hercule Poirot, takes on the investigation, he realizes immediately that the killer is a deceitfully clever and ruthless individual who leaves a trail of false clues designed to keep him off track.  The suspects, a diverse, international collection of travelers, are marooned by a snowstorm, preventing the escape of the murderer.  M. Poirot takes the passenger's testimony, examines evidence, and through flawless logic and ability, begins to unravel the crime.  The story builds up slowly, gathering momentum as it approaches its startling, spellbinding conclusion. <BR> Through an intriguing plot, an unusual setting, and realistic, detailed descriptions, the author makes this an appealing book to read.  The plot is somewhat slow in unfolding, yet the emergence of unexpected evidence and revelations compel you to keep reading.  In addition to the plot, the atypical setting of this book, depicted with detailed imagery, focuses your attention as you seek to uncover hidden clues.  The characters are brought alive through detailed depiction of their appearance, personality, and manner of speech. <BR>   I would highly recommend this book to people who enjoy mysteries and crime stories that are not too scary or violent.  M. Poirot is a intriguing main character who takes you through the evidence as if you were actually the detective trying to piece the puzzle together.  Yet one can hardly predict the incredible and thrilling resolution to this mystery!  Thus, for people who savor suspense and enjoy trying to put clues together to solve crimes, this is an exceptional book to read.
038533348X|5.0|Being the age of sixteen and being in the environment when not reading is considered &quot;cool,&quot; my English class was assigned to read this book by Vonnegut as an assignment.  Most teenagers fear this assignment, and I was one of them, not wanting to HAVE to read just for the sake of writing down notes and listening to what the teacher had to say about the author's words.  But once I began to read the text, I was engrossed in Vonnegut's phrases and the satires he used to describe every day life.  Among other books that I have read during my school years, this was the only one I truly read for content.  I enjoyed the ways Vonnegut criticized scientists, and the way he described the made-up religion of Bokononism.  His intelligent understanding of the way things are run in the world made it perfect for his words to capture the  obsurdity that is really shining through.  I loved this book and plan to read others by Vonnegut, and I thank my teacher for finally assigning a book that caught my attention.
0395177111|5.0|The hobbit, a great book in its own right, also serves as a great prequel for anyone that has seen the recently released Lord of the Rings movie and who wants to experience more of Tolken's eclectic fantasy world. Tolken writing is exceptionally accessible, and the book keeps you in the story until the very end. A \\"classic\\" adventure story, the book also is not lacking in deeper meaning, and raises questions about manipulation, conscience and human (ok, hobbit) nature. All around, The Hobbit is a good read!
0060264306|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Laura Ingalls Wilder and fondly remember reading the Little House books when I was a child. I've just started reading the series to my 7-year-old daughter, though, and while she loved Little House on the Prairie, she was far less fond of this one. In fact, although  she's usually a good listener, I found her attention constantly wandering as we read this book.<br /> And in all honesty, I could understand why. Laura Ingalls Wilder is without a doubt one of the best children's writers who ever lived, but I think she had barely begun to show her enormous talent when she wrote this book. Although there are wonderful little snippets of family life, and a few hints of the conflicts between the feisty Laura and her more reserved and perfect sister Mary, the truth is, there isn't much of a plot here. And Mrs. Wilder goes on for page after page describing how bullets were made, or butter churned. There are probably children who find that fascinating, God bless them, but my daughter was just bored by it.<br />I don't think this is a BAD book, but Little House on the Prairie is so much better, so much more interesting that I think if you want to read the series to a young child, that's the place to start, even though this is the first book in the series. This is a book for children who have already fallen in love with Laura and her wonderful family.

B00004SCX6|5.0|If you didn't like the \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" album don't bother to read this. This album led by lead single, \\"Oops!.. I Did It Again,\\" is pure pop gold and has a bit of everything on it. I bought this album the first day andit was worth every penny. 1.3 million people must have liked Britney the first week it came out otherwise, this would most likely be passed up and put in the sale bins.

B00005MAM2|4.0|AKIRA: this is the second best manga ever, falling just short of the incredible ghost in the shell, which is one of my favourite movies of all time, let alone animes. Akira is a definate purchase for anyone who can enjoy manga. The style of drawing on the characters is a little strange in the first 5 minutes, but after that you begin to question all other manga styles, as it looks great. Im not going to even start on the story, which is complex and intelligent, thick with symbolism and thought-provoking concepts. <br />The music is classy, and fits the film perfectly. EG The amazing Tetsuo theme, brings the power and suspense of the films climax to your ears.<br />This DVD is must purchase for any manga fan or anyone who has not seen this film. It also is a perfect starting place for anyone looking to get into anime/manga. (Beware the disturbing ending!)
0783225970|5.0|Scarface is the best movie ever made,from the mobster world. I watch this movie over and over again and never get tired. Its the best action from Al Pachino, my favorite actor. I have posters of this movie all over my walls, in my office and in my house. This movie has very famous line like &quot;You wana play rough&quot; and my favorite one &quot;say goodnight to the bad guy&quot;
B00005RY7X|4.0|You've heard the song &quot;Party Hard&quot; already, and that song is the first time in ten years or so something jumped out of my radio speakers instead of oozing out of them. That's right folks, as strange as it may seem, it's been that long since anything resembling rock 'n roll has been played on MTV or gotten any airplay at all. Does this mean that the decade-long reign of kiddie-disco and boring, self indulgent, psuedo-art sludge is finally at an end? God, let's hope so. Breath of fresh air this CD is, but unfortunately, not a perfect one. I, like many of you heard the catchy and ballsy &quot;Party hard&quot; and almost had to pinch myself that someone who sounded awake during recording was being played on the radio in 2002. I ran out to buy the album which is something I havent done in quite awhile, and was....mildly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I like the album, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys the buoyant spirit of rock n' roll, however, one small thing has kept this from my must hear list;I hate drum machines. I hate them alot. I hate them more than the way my college laundry hamper smelled. I hate them more than a Katie Couric interview or even more than finding foriegn objects in my breakfast cereal. Drum machines are bad, and there are alot of them on this album. In all of the bad reviews from cranky, arrogant college students describing this as 80's metal, you never hear any mention of this. Let me set them straight. Metal bands have this guy who sits at the back of the stage and pounds these big, round things called drums. They are loud and ballsy and sound good. This CD doesn't have them. There is a drummer in the video, but he's not on this disc....unfortunately. Andrew is definately onto something here, and if he can wrestle the airwaves back from the teeny-boppers and &quot;whine like a valium addicted rich housewife&quot; angst drones, then I'm all for it. Let's just hope the next time he does it with a drummer, because the onlything I hate more than the modern state of radio, is wasting good rock n' roll songs on a disco beat.
B00005OCMR|5.0|The character of Flynn is my favorite in all literature and cinema. Highly underrated as a social anti-hero, his meeting with Tron is one of the greatest &quot;encounters&quot; in all cinema. The DVD finally does it justice. I recommend this DVD to everyone!
B000003N7K|5.0|A flawless work of art.  These virtuosi got evey song exactly right.  Share it with someone you love.
B00005B36H|5.0|Well, where to start?<br />Melodically, Tool use mainly minor pentatonic scales. Being used prolificly in Medieval and Renaissance times, this lends a dark brooding beauty to Tool's music. It recalls dark ages of suspicion, prejudice, and simmering emotional discord. Tool also throw in non-Western melodic influences, with the flattened second scale degree, and the augmented second interval. Vistas of magical cultures are realised before our eyes, times and places beyond our mortal existence.<br />Rhythmically, Tool are an ever changing beast. Non symmetrical time signatures abound, there is little reliance on 'groove' to power the music. There is a kind of logical beauty to Tool's anisotropic rhythms, resembling the unearthly splendour that arises out of geometrical abstractions. The ethereal passage in 'Schism' floats in and out of space-time, carrying the sullen desire of a thousand lost and weary souls. The rhythm escapes physical restraints, venturing beyond what is thought possible. <br />Harmonically, Tool's exploration rarely ventures beyond the implications of the melodic framework. It is all heavy and doom laden, drenched in the sorrow of minor keys and non-Western scales. But within the vocabulary of a child, Tool speak with the poise and grace of a wisened adult. Harmonies soar with unity and simplicity, but drive straight to the essential being of existence.<br />Texturally, astral passages traverse the crowded mappings within oppressive and heavy spaces. Hurricanes are as common as light rain, and the eye of the storm is beautiful but ponderous. No respite is offered, sanctuary does not exist in Tool's universal vision. Fierce guitar tussles with haunting vocals, the bass worms it's way through lightless underground depths, while the drums mesmerise in their subtle isomorphisms and overt power.<br />Structurally, Tool play with chronological order, the very fabric of time is bent back upon itself. To enter Tool's physical universe is to abandon our own.There is no escape. Melodic themes are presented, then translated by violations of natural order. Motives are twisted by amorphous rhythms, yet the harmony remains discernible and somewhat stable. It is the sole acknowledgement to the world that was the point of departure. Souls are devoured in labyrinthine structures. Even the structures are devoured within the chaos, and spat out as perversely inverted reflections of the original. At the end, nothing is as it was, yet the point of arrival is a logical progression from the beginning. <br />In a new universe, we cannot possibly fathom why we understand the journey experienced, but we do. It is upon this realisation that the full impact of this new world occurs. The physical is no more. Only the soul survives, only the pure spiritual nature of ourselves.<br />Put together, the elements of Tool's music create an entity which is altogether umbrageous, anxious, melancholy, haunting, enlightening, cerebral, assurgent; in fact, beyond all superlatives. To put it simply, no other band do what Tool do. They must be treasured. <br />A jewel of human soul.
B000063DIR|1.0|As much as I love and respect the Ozz man, I can't support his, (or more correctly, Sharon's), decision to rewrite history. Both Bob Daisley and Lee kerslake are well respected rock & roll vetrans. Lee better known as Uriah Heep's founding and current drummer, while Daisley's credentials stand tall on their own... Rainbow,Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Michael schenker, and Yngwie J. Malmsteen to name but a few. The original recordings stand as a testiment of the time in which they were recorded in... a record of that historic period in Ozzy's solo career. It's a real shame that greed plays such a huge part in the lives of those who already have so much... is it unreasonable for Daisley and Kerslake to ask for what they feel they justly deserve? Probably not, and while I certainly don't know the whole story... rewriting the past to keep from paying out royalties seems so drastic a step to take... it's a real shame. I love those original, magical recordings, and am a fan of both Bob Daisley's and Lee Kerslake's as well as Ozzy's, making it so much more difficult to accept these re-released \\"re-mastered\\" discs. These new remasters make the re-hiring of Zakk for Ozzy's most recent \\"Down To Earth\\" forgivable. The only recomomendation I can give is to stick w/ the original re-masters from a few years ago... they're well priced and worth more due to the magic heald inside them.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Allow one of the brain-dead (see &quot;galleries&quot; review - term review used very loosely here) to chime in on this film for a moment.  Many of the scenes of Mulholland Drive create good atmosphere and have moments of bizarre comedy.  I found it quite engrossing up to about the last half hour of the movie when it appears at first to just fall apart.  I've since formed my own hypothesis which I fear uttering because I don't won't to seem stupid (he's saying it's just a movie and thus an illusion, right?).<br />What really bothers me are the hoards of self righteous Lynch toadies who defensively condemn any person that may not find this to his or her likings.  I see a great deal of movies and have been known to prefer arthouse and/or foreign film that don't get a large audience... and I can see very well how this movie can win the disdain of many a viewer.  These viewers should have no shame and hold their heads high, for they are doing a greater service for the mission of this type of work than the little lapdogs who decide that because the story ultimately doesn't make much sense that it must be a work of astounding genius and thus beyond the average American mindset.<br />Form your own opinion.  Me - I liked most of Mulholland Drive but have to wonder what the hell it was all for... maybe I could rate it higher if it was enjoyable enough for me to want to sit through it a third or fourth time to figure it all out.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game was a deeply concentrated novel that imposed and introspected what the effects of technology on ethics and lifestyle could be.  How ethical was the use of science in weeding out the perfect soldier?  I am proposing that the methodology of the scientists and military was absolutely inexcusable in the way that they molded Ender from childhood and took advantage of his bad home situation.  Throughout the entire novel, Ender is being talked about behind his back and his entire future is being decided.  Is he or is he not the prefect soldier that is bred to save mankind?  <BR>  Ender is the third son of the family which was illegal to have in the time this novel takes place.  The government allowed them to have a &quot;third&quot; because they wanted to experiment to find the perfect soldier.  To what extent should genetic experiments be sanctioned by a governing body?  This is in fact exactly what the &quot;powers that be&quot; is this novel do.  They produce and mold Ender as the prodigal soldier who makes the right decision in battle (with a bully at his school) and is the ushered into a final situation where worldly ethics and boundaries of technology are given a questionable reality.

B000059TPN|5.0|The Rock Dvd was the first disc I bought when I finally purchased a DVD player 4 years ago.It was my favorite movie at that time and it still remains so.Unfortunately the disc didn't include ANY extras at all and the picture transfer and sound quality were below average.Last year,when I heard that The Rock was getting a Criterion release it so much deserved,this was one of the best DVD news I ever got.<br />General Hummel (Ed Harris)is highly frustrated because many soldiers under his command died in secret operations and they didn't get the treatment they deserved from the government.Hummel is determined to change that,and when all else fails, with the help of ex-marines,he seizes control of Alcatraz Prison,which is now a tourist attraction,and threatens to launch chemical weapons on San Fransisco unless his demands are met.The government decides to infiltrate the island with marines,and they also need the help of FBI biochemist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage),who is more of a science man than an action man.However,nobody knows much about Alcatraz's infrastructure and the maze of tunnels below the rock,and the only person who owns that kind of information is the only person who has ever been able to escape from there,John Mason (Sean Connery),a man who has been held in prison for many years without trial,and we don't know why.Goodspeed,Mason and the marines team up to enter the rock,neutralize the chemical weapons and release the hostages.As the movie progresses,we also learn more about Mason,his past,why he was in prison and who he is.<br />The Rock is one of the best action movies ever,if not the best.The primary reason is I think the presence of 3 great actors,who take their characters seriously,which sets the movie apart from the competition.Ed Harris plays General Hummel beautifully,we can never be sure whether he will actually \\"do it\\",Sean Connery is Sean Connery as usual and Mason character will remind many people of another character Connery is so famous for,and finally Nic Cage,in maybe his first great action movie,portays an original and often funny character.Director Michael Bay's fast cutting techniques and visual stylization is a nice fit for this kind of film,although many people don't take him as a serious director.The script seems composed of parts from many other movies we have seen before,but still,The Rock somehow manages to be interesting.The original score by Hans Zimmer is genuinely magnicifent and is one of the other reasons why the Rock is sensational.<br />The Dvd extras are a handful and I don't think you will be disappointed.There is a commentary by Michael Bay,Cage,producer Bruckheimer and Ed Harris.It is a bit dull and I wish it included Connery as well.The other extras are special effect analysis,the history of Alcatraz,world premiere and some outtakes and deleted extended scenes.What sets the criterion edition apart from the previous version is the anomorphic digital transfer,and the picture&sound quality.If you want the Rock as a part of your collection,Criterion edition is the right one for you.<br />If you are into action movies,I can not think of a reason why you shouldn't like The Rock.And even if you already own the previous dvd edition,you definitely should consider buying this one too..
B0000028RR|1.0|The music on this CD is average, later to be completely eclipsed by their future albums. Someone please [remove] Zack de la Rocha. Better yet, go back in time and stop him from joining this band. He really is that awful. Any possibility of this being a good recording is totally ruined by his slobbering Sylvester the cat vocals repeating the same communist buzzwords over and over and over and over and over... yes, they really do repeat forever. It's like hearing a bunch of fools at a protest rally shout irritating catchphrases again and again instead of actual conversation. System of a Down has similar incorrect political opinions, but at least they think out their lyrics and form them together like an essay. You'll hear nothing of the sort here. Just tired socialist propaganda that leaves you feeling dirty after being subjected to it. Check out their later albums, but stay far, far away from this one unless you can remove the vocals somehow. And the Led Zeppelin [copy] was lame.
B000002UDD|5.0|This is one great album by Megadeth, it opens with the evil firey instrumental \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\", since in hell there is no limit to the fire and brimstone you will see!!  \\"Set The World Afire\\" is another great firey metal anthem, and since I'm Fire Godd I've often thought of setting a little fire to the world myself!!!  For \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" you can feel Dave Mustaine's anguish in the singing, since in the darkness, there is no fire and flames, and man I'd be down too!!!  The rest of the album has that evil brimstone feel to it as well, do not pass this album up, its a tribal fire right of passage!!!
B000006TRV|2.0|I didn't grow up with The Wall,... It manages to be pretentious, boring and irritating all at the same time. Read other reviews for details. I dare you to find one erson who didn't hear this in high school who likes it now. 2 stars for Run Like Hell, Comfortably Numb and Brick II. Get Dark Side of the Moon instead of this.
B00005QGAT|4.0|the album was Michael coming out party the album was his chance to put the music out that he wanted us to hear it included a lot of disco music this showed Michael's ability to keep up with the times it also showed everyone who doubted him to keep up his fame as a artist despite his growth one of with classics like &quot;Don't stop till you get enough &quot; Michael showed why he would later on be known as the king of pop
B000002NIW|1.0|Please stop calling this the best CD ever. You have got to be kidding yourself. I admit a few songs had potential, like Around the Fur and Be Quiet And Drive, but they just wasted them. My Own Summer steals the riff from Metallica's The Outlaw Torn and most of the other songs sound like they used the first riff that popped in their head and used it for the whole song. That's too bad, since everyone in the band is talented, as shown in the fury and hooks of Adrenaline (Before Chino ruined his voice by shouting so much) and the beautiful music of White Pony. Try those out if you like, but be quiet and drive (far away from this CD).
B00005JKJA|5.0|I wrote an earlier review right after I had seen the DVD for the first time.  I had been astonished that there are no extras and no chapter breaks on the DVD, and was reluctant to recommend it because of that.<br />After doing more research, however, I discovered that everything about ALL of David Lynch's DVD's are in place the way they are because that is the way Lynch wants it.  None of his movies have commentary or chapter breaks.  Admittedly, it would be difficult to imagine a commentary that didn't just give away the store on this mysterious movie.  And if Lynch wants me to view the movie without chapter breaks, then who am I to question the maestro?<br />So, sometime in the future, after Lynch is gone and the Criterion Collection picks up the rights to this masterpiece, we will get a thorough commentary.  I still wish that there was a little more warning about the DVD's quirks on the outside case -- the absence of common DVD features will definitely confound the casual viewer....<br />But I must retract my earlier trashing of the DVD.  The picture and sound are spectacular, and they are placed on the disc the way the creator intends them to be.
B0000634EV|1.0|I love NOLA.  You can tell these guys were just doing what they loved in it just happened to become an album.  It just has that feel.  Like everything just feel into place without having to work at it.  Its a pure rock album.<BR>Down II is not like that.  It seems like they tried hard to get that same groove, that southern rock feel.  I really tried to like this album...and it has some decent guitar, lyrics, and beats.  But in this case the whole is not the sum of its parts, it just doesn't come together.  It feels about as real as a brittany spears album, and it pains me to say that.
6305265666|1.0|The overriding message of Ever After is this: Strong willed women (even whiney sounding ones) can get whatever they want. And all men are either stupid, ineffectual, or just plain evil. Unless of course they're the age of your great-grandfather (and therefore beyond any sort of sexuality). Then they're OK. Poor Drew Barrymore gets the worst dialogue I have ever seen her stuck with. Angelica Huston comes off looking pretty well, but then she gets better lines. I also have to agree with the reviewer who noted that, for a story set in France, everyone has a curiously British accent, by George!  I will concede that the costuming and sets are breath-taking. Indeed, if only this were a silent I might even respect it. As it is the only people I see enjoying this are self-absorbed women or castrated men. Oh yeah, one other thing. Do a DVD search on [amazon.com]. Key in the word \\"Cinderella\\". Look at the selling price of the other versions. Notice the difference? There's a reason for it. If you've got a winner, you price it for whatever you think you can get away with. If you've got a dog, you lower the price and hope for the best...
0385503954|2.0|This is a much hyped book that I was eagerly waiting for. I even pre-ordered it based on various TV accolades. Well, the first 50 pages were very difficult to plow through, but then it picked up and after setting it aside twice, I finished it. <br />It's no Jane Eyre, or even the fast moving Tom Clancy, but worth the money and the read.
B000060P79|5.0|If u like Blink 182 , Good Charlotte, New found Glory or Sum41 than this is the CD for you. Full of great catchy songs you could listen to for hours.
B000001FI7|3.0|Maybe this CD will grow on me, but I'll have to come out of my music-induced depression first.  I picked this up after hearing descriptions of it on [amazon.com] and seeing that it makes numerous top CD lists in the accompaniment of other works that are right up my alley.  I started listening to this CD at work and after a few songs began to worry that office mates would overhear and start hiding sharp objects from me...it carries an electronic detached laden depressing sound.  I found myself staring at my computer wondering if anything was really worth doing and if anything truly mattered.  I then starting gazing at my shoes repeatedly until the album ended and realized life is short and if I'm looking for a soundtrack to live it by, the sound of Portishead ain't doing it.<br />Beth Gibbons sounds like a muted Sade, Sade on valium.  The first track \\"Mysterons,\\" has this spooky goofy synthesizer that reminds me of Scooby Doo and friends driving around in the magic mystery machine van with the goofy background music playing just as things turn spooky.  I guess I'm just not hearing a big musical breakthrough on this CD that I expected to find based on all the customer reviews on [amazon.com].  There are bright moments here and there as far as a little musical ingenuity, but they are mostly tinged with gray clouds.  Glory Box is a highlight.  Sour Times is decent but the majority of the music drags on. Life is too short to have it drag by, dummy!
B0000025ZK|4.0|For me, this album transports me to a different time and stirs emotions that were inexoribly connected with those times.  I was just 14 when I got this album on vinyl (and I wish I still had it) and had just thrown back several shots of Rum from my parents liqour cabinet.  <BR>I do confess that I was looking for an extesion of the Pink Floyd sound.  Needless to say, in that aspect I was somewhat disappointed. Aside from that, I loved the record. Only halfway into the second song I was practically on my knees, paying homage to Lord Gilmour. It was a good thing that I didn't have a younger brother or pet goat at the time, for had there been any backmasking suggesting a live sacrifice if I found this record to my liking, I would have spent a better part of the next few years as a ward of the state. I swear that it wasn't the reduction of my sobriety that affected my opinion, for \\"About Face\\" remained one of my favorites through the '80s. <BR>Some think this album sux and use it as testimony that it was Roger Waters who made Pink Floyd so great.  However, if you take a look at the Waters' releases divorced from Gilmour, Mason, Wright, it proves that Floyd was not a person - that the whole is better than the sum of the parts. Sure, \\"Pros an Cons\\" was a great album, but look at the list of supporting musicians to carry it through: Eric Clapton, Ray Cooper, Michael Kamen, etc.  Take a look at \\"Radio KAOS\\"... a pretty good record, but still doesn't hold a candle to even \\"The Final Cut\\", which is usually noted as the worst Floyd album. You could say the same for \\"Amused to Death\\", a good record, but will never be as timeless as \\"Wish You Were Here\\".  Let's not even mention \\"Music From the Body\\".  I digress though.  <BR>About face is a depature from Pink Floyd and has some great tracks such as \\"All Lovers are Deranged\\", - which is one of my favorite songs of all time. The haunting melody of \\"Out of the Blue\\" which really rips at your heart, and \\"Cruise\\" which is a meditaion on the possible events of the Cold War, which was in full swing at the time.  <BR>I suggest this album for anyone who wants to get a more personal glimpse into the thoughs od David Gilmour.  David Gilmour was not Pink Floyd, and may well never be.  But neither was/will Roger Waters be Pink Floyd any more than Nick Mason or Rick Wright.  If there is a person who was Pink Floyd, it would have to be Syd Barrett, who ironicaly has absolutely nothing to do with Pink Floyd at the high-point of their Popularity.
B00005OWIU|4.0|Many reviewers have said this can compare to HOOK. What this score lacks, ironically, is magic. It has a very dominant theme, and there are several good cues, but let's face it, nothing will ever come close to classics like HOOK or JURASSIC PARK or E.T. This score, however, is miles above the 2001 fare, save LORD OF THE RINGS. While the score is fantastic, at one point during the film it struck me as too loud. Dunno, maybe that was the theater's fault, but I did enjoy it very much.

0140157352|5.0|Very Valuable<BR>This book is valuable for negotiators representing themselves or other parties in complex disputes. It is also valuable for dealing with non-business related disputes. Getting To Yes offers valuable insight into the psychology of disputes and dispute resolution. It empowers you in ordinary situations such as buying a car or settling a personal insurance claim. I read it again and again before I serve as a negotiator and also before I act as a third-party mediator. I also recommend Basic Skills for the New Mediator and Basic Skills for the New Arbitrator by Allan H. Goodman for those interested in aiding people in settling disputes.
0440180295|4.0|This is a serious book about war seemly hidden by Vonnegut. The book jumps around a good bit, as the main character is unstuck in time. Because of this and the lack of character interaction, many people may find the book a hard read. However, the book is well worth the effort. It certainly gave me a new perspective on conventional war.
B0000640VO|5.0|I saw this tonight at the film festival in my city, and it is one of the most wonderful movies that I have ever had the pleasure to come across.  I would recommend it to *anyone*.

1587990717|5.0|... I got this book last week and read it in one sitting. I simply could not put it down.  The ideas in this book, combined with my background in operations research and recent experience in financial risk management, really stirred by brain up. I'd call the experience as a randomness awakening experience.
0920668372|1.0|Given to me as a gift, I heard many glowing reviews of this book and was told it would leave me weeping.  Not only was I dry-eyed at the end, but this book left a bad taste in my mouth.  A mothers love?  Not quite...more like a mother-son example of co-dependence.  The son comes across as a spoiled little brat that the mom \\"loves anyway.\\"  She rocks him to sleep even as he becomes an adult...very healthy.  No matter what the author intended, this book is only a lesson in bad parenting.  It makes me nervous that so many people liked this book so much.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I feel left out to have just learned of this band recently, but I am making up for lost time, I assure you!  Not knowing a whole lot about the background of the band, I can say their music is quite interesting and complex.  It combines many rockin' songs with some mellow ones for what I think makes a great balance.  They also use very complex instrumentation and their mixing is superb.  I have heard many of their songs from different sources and find them to be very enjoyable and diverse.  ROCK ON!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite David Lynch films (ok, all his films are favorites of mine) but why is there digital blurring in the film to cover up \\"adult\\" parts of the movie. The film was shot, edited and then shown in theaters \\"uncut.\\" But for the DVD Lynch (or someone hovering above Lynch) has decided to digitally blur nudity in the film. Why shoot nudity in the first place? Why not edit it out of the film originally? To censor it now because the lead actresses are becoming big stars seems like a cop-out. If this movie and its actresses hadn't received attention or acclaim, if the movie had \\"flopped\\" and no one had gone to see it, would the film still be censored for its DVD release? Following this train of thought, why not blur out Isabella Rossellini's full frontal nude scenes for the upcoming Blue Velvet special edition DVD? Is it because she is no longer conisidered a \\"hot\\" actress of the moment? When push comes to shove, it appears commerce precedes art even on Mulholland Drive which is a big disappointment. I didn't see this movie for its glimpses of nudity, but to censor them out is an insult to viewers and the dvd buying public. (Never mind the fact that this single disc dvd with no extras costs more than many double-disc sets on the market.) This was a good movie but the dvd release is a slap in the face to fans.
6304508611|5.0|I remember seeing a story about Stephen King and hearing about how this story came to be. He started to write it and, thinking it wasn't good, threw it out. His wife later found it in the waste paper basket and read it. She begged him to finish it because she felt it was great. And history was made. I have never read a Stephen King book. For some reason I find it highly difficult to get through, but I am an avid fan of the movie versions and after seeing them I study the books to see how they add up. However I feel that a movie will never be as good as the book because there is so much you can do in a book that can't be conveyed on the big screen. <BR>Stephen King has set a new standard for the horror flick, and he did it with this movie. Sissy Spacek is an amazing actress, why she has not won more Oscars or made more movies is beyond me. She is a talented and very down to earth woman. She, over the years, has not changed or &quot;sold out&quot; in hollywood. Unlike many of her fellow costars. If you see any Stephen King movie, let it be this one. I also highly recommend: &quot;The Stand&quot;, &quot;Storm of the Century&quot;, &quot;Rose Red&quot;, &quot;The Langoliers&quot;, &quot;Thinner&quot;, &quot;It&quot;, &quot;The Tommy Knockers&quot;, &quot;The Golden Years&quot; and my personal absolute favorite &quot;Drama&quot; of his &quot;The Green Mile&quot;. But do, see all his films. I just highly recommend these first. Here are the rest of his movies that I can remember off the top of my head...<BR>&quot;Cujo&quot;, &quot;Pet Semetary&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;, &quot;Salem's Lot&quot;, &quot;Firestarter&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Creep Show I, II, &amp; III.&quot;, &quot;Cat's Eye&quot;, &quot;Sleepwalkers&quot;, &quot;The Running Man&quot;, &amp; &quot;The Shining&quot; (The Kubrick version was okay, but itlost a lot of the book, I recommend you see the newer version the one that came out in 99-00.) That's it. -Willow

What do these two acts have in common?<br />Answer: the same greedy manager, Rod Smallwood. It makes no sense for Halford release an album after just one solo LP (as &quot;HALFORD&quot;), and fill it with Priest songs.

Check out Track #2 &quot;Why Georgia&quot; and #4 &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot;.. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good study music, driving music, cooking music, or new covers to learn..
0385335482|5.0|I picked up the book at my local library and literally could not put it down.  The book follows the adventures of Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Bloomwood a financial journalist who just cannot seem to get her own finances in order due to a little shoping addiction she has.  It is so funny to read how she gets herself into and out of so much debt.  I really identified with Becky and how she would dread to open her Visa statements.  Highly reccomended to all shopaholics and recovering shopaholics!
B00005V9HH|4.0|A lot of movies with twist endings have no replay value.  With this movie, I always find something interesting that I hadn't noticed the previous viewing.
0743216458|4.0|Upon being absolutely blown-away by the expert HBO mini-series adaptation of this book I was eager to read through and learn more about the remarkable cast of characters who made up the 506 Regiment's 'Easy' Company.  Ambrose does not disappoint and the bulk of this book - dealing with the training processes, descriptions of personality, psyche along with numerous humourous anecdotes are as well written as anything that i've seen in any combat/military book around.  While the recounting of Easy Company's battles and detailed breakdown of squad/tactical manuevers are important and given equal attention they thankfully take a backseat to the more captivating storyline on how esprit de corp was developed over time and the value of the camarederie and brotherhood that the surviving members valued most of all.  If you were a fan of the HBO mini-series and had even the tiniest inkling in learning more about this 'Band of Brothers,' you can't go wrong with this very well-written, detailed account of their story.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I can't add much to what everyone has said, I'll just recommend my favorite tracks: &quot;Po' Lazarus&quot;, &quot;Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot;, &quot;Hard Time Killing Floor Blues&quot;, &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot;, &quot;In the Jailhouse Now&quot;.<br />The amazing thing about this album is that it achieved its (extremely well-deserved) critical and popular success without any radio airplay!  It doesn't fit the pigeonholed categories (or &quot;formats&quot;) whose dominance has ruined music radio, and demonstrates what a terrible shame and a scandal that situation is.<br />Bob Dylan made a great folk/country album last year, and that the &quot;O Brother&quot; soundtrack is even better tells you all you need to know.  It's so good I'm going to get the movie too.
B00005V9HH|5.0|I was blown away by this film the first time that I watched it. Never before had I seen such a compellingly written crime story that becomes something more: a series of psychological mind games - the film itself becomes an entity, daring you to make preconceptions of any kind, daunting you with plot twists, strangling you with suspense, until the final card has been played and the only thought that comes into mind is <br />wow<br />It is a film where nothing is as it seems, and trying to find what is real is like a dog chasing after its tail. The story, so much as can be told, is that a ship caught on fire outside San Pedro, California, and only two people survived: a Hungarian with burns covering over half of his body and Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a cripple from New York. The events are told via flashback, Kint describing how he hooked up with hardened criminals such as Michael McManus, Todd Hockney, Fenster, and his friend Dean Keaton, an ex-cop and ex-con just wanting to play it straight. As the story unfolds, the men have to serve the will of the diabolical Keyser Soze, and the power of the film grows until the end, when we realize that the Keyser (and Chris McQuarrie) have played us for fools.<br />This is not a movie for everyone. If in a crime story you need somebody getting whacked every minute and guns and explosives constantly, you might be a bit bored. Sure, there are all those things, but the emphasis of the movie is on its story and most of the film is dialogue. If you resent having your mind challenged and messed with, please do not apply. If you do not want to pay close attention to every scene to try to find out what's happening, some of the enjoyment might be lost. However, the beauty of The Usual Suspects is that nearly every loose end is tied up, except for one: What happened to Keyser Soze?<br />Excellent camerawork and sound help one get into the film. But more compelling is the acting. Gabriel Byrne is phlegmatic and charismatic as Keaton, a man wanting to change but tormented by the Establishment (Keyser) and by inner demons. Stephen Baldwin plays the macho McManus, and he is utterly convincing in the role. Benicio Del Toro, in one of his earlier performances, turns the rather insignificant role of Fenster into a captivating performance, he goes over the deep end, but it works perfectly. Kevin Pollak plays Hockney, a pyrotechnic who is worried about himself only. Pollak gives a fine performance and his natural comic timing adds some levity to the plot. Kevin Spacey gives his most complex and mesmerizing role as Verbal, whose brilliance is in that he seems boring and ordinary, when, in fact, he is not. Chazz Palmintieri plays his character with both sensitivity and toughness, and pulls it off brilliantly.<br />The extensive extras include deleted scenes (none of which really add anything to the story) a gag reel (the Keyser Soze rap song was hilarious) extensive documentaries and comentaries. Although they go through the processes of making an independent film, the director and screenwriter offer only a few insights into their craft. Alas, the film speaks louder than they could.<br />This film is genius, pure and simple. It is one of those \\"questioning reality\\" movies without the laws of physics being broken and machines trying to kill humanity off. This comes highly recommended.
B00005ARDC|5.0|Look.  Just buy it, put on some headphones, and listen to it...really listen.  Yes, it's gothy, dark, and DUH, Love &amp; Rockets-y.  But it's really much more luxuriously layered and flowing than you'd expect from the debut release of pretty-boy media darlings.  They ROCK, they're talented AND pretty, which almost never happens, and you can hardly help but feel their pain right along with them.  I bought this album because I was able to listen to it first.  I listened to it because I had heard rumblings here and there about this BRMC thing.  I had just seen Vue, who opened for BRMC on their UK tour earlier this year (or some other time...does it really matter?) but all my preconceived notions about what this band's music would be like were wrong.  Instead of being loud, angry, and in-your-face as one might expect from a &quot;Black Rebel Motorcycle Club&quot;, they're subtle, dark, a little remorseful, and really, quite pleasant.  Give it a go, folks...I doubt you'll be disappointed, and if you are, then get over it and go listen to something else.
0553212443|4.0|This slim volume is an example of Victorian literature at its finest. Dickens' literary voice croons with the tempo of the story, dark and foreboding as the ghosts escort Scrooge on his journey and upbeat and merry as he reforms his ways. It is a story of hope in the human spirit, urging you not to give up on people, not to count them out because they may surprise you. Although I doubt that many a moral eyesore can be transformed so easily and heartily as Scrooge, Dickens artfully exploited the marshmallowy feeling many experience during the Christmas season, which makes this a believable and much loved story.<BR> Dickens immersed Victorian themes in many ways and with great skill. The worship of children as innocent creatures was apparent in the way that Tiny Tim was glorified. His pitiful image and heart of gold appeal to our senses as well as it did to the Victorians.<BR> A thirst for the supernatural was quenched through the use of the three spirits. They are not exactly Christian in nature, yet they seek to do good. This secular flirtation could indicate that Victorians' faith was being shaken and in its place a value system based on choosing favorable Christian principles and disregarding the rest. As is human tendency, we do not usually care about anything until it is almost gone (such as endangered species), and when Christian faith was questioned, interest began to percolate in the Victorians. I believe we still like basic Christian ideals, but going to church is asking for a lot. We continue to have more of an interest in phantoms than angels.<BR> Also integrated was the belief that the middle class is more virtuous because they work for their money. Bob Cratchit did not need moral instruction; Scrooge, an old miser, did. It teaches that sacrifices made for money will be costly. Scrooge lost a woman who loved him by being greedy. She dismissed him regretfully; \\"You fear the world too much. All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond itssordid reproach. I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion, Gain, engrosses you\\" (Dickens 37). This theme is timeless as a recent movie, Family Man, heavily drew upon it as a successful businessman who had discarded the fancies of a wife and children, woke up one morning to having both and realized he had been in error. The Victorians and many contemporary Americans ache to believe that the pursuit of wealth is not as fulfilling as two hands with wedding bands clasped and changing dirty diapers. Whether or not this is accurate I cannot say because I have neither.<BR> Dickens was a Victorian mastermind and he knew what Christmas was all about. It is about looking for the best in people and the world. It is one time that it is okay to be cheesy, okay to be touched by stories of hope and love. So next Christmas, when the snow falls like sugar and the sentimental tears fall like rain, pick up A Christmas Carol and watch the Victorians come out of the woodwork. They look a lot like us and this is why Dickens' novel has survived.<BR>
B000001FTJ|3.0|While there were hints of an experimental Tom Waits on &quot;Blue Valentine,&quot; this was the first album where I found myself thinking that I was listening to a totally reinvented Tom Waits.<br />Nearly twenty years later, I still feel &quot;hot &amp; cold&quot; when I listen to this release. I think the lyrical Waits reaches incredible new heights with tunes like &quot;Frank's Wild Years&quot; and &quot;In the Neighborhood.&quot; Musically, the album lost me at times. There are brief pieces like &quot;Johnsburg, Illinois,&quot; a haunting romantic bit with a ghostly chill to it, where Waits' new musical paint job works well. But much of the album drags with what sounds to me like too much experiment, too little music.<br />If you're one of those Tom Waits fans who likes both his pre and post 1970s sound, and want to grab one CD that captures both sides of Tom Waits, I would pass on Sworfishtrombones. His follow up, &quot;Rain Dogs,&quot; captures the essence of all Tom Waits; eery artsy tunes with enough melody to still be music.<br />If it's vintage Tom Waits lyrics you're fishing for, Swordfishtrombones is well worth a listen. The music, to my ears, tends to drag. While I'm not close-minded to offbeat and experimental art, I'm not a passionate fan. Take this into account: if you are a bit more open-minded than I am, this CD might be just the pick for you!
6303168507|5.0|The holocaust is surely about the most difficult event or series of events to understand or depict. Very few films have succeeded. The rather cheesy 70s TV series \\"Holocaust\\", although a reasonable try at it for prime time TV, comes to mind. Here Spielberg presents in an almost completely non-sugar-coated way, with believable people and events, a view of the holocaust as it happened in and around Cracow. It needs to be said that the original book is outstanding too - without this as the source for the film, the film would probably not have worked. Harrowing, horrible and still incredible to believe. The way people speak and the things they say appears to have the authentic feel of the period. The soundtrack is outstanding - unbelievably real sounds of shooting and the clink of cartridges on pavements (shells on sidewalks) make this a very difficult and uncomfortable viewing experience. Just as it should be, of course. This deserves five stars without any doubt. If I must find anything to criticize, then I think there are three things that were unnecessary. Why black and white? The events took place in color - the world was not black and white - why not show it in its real hues? Well, we know why black and white was chosen, but I do think that black and white=old or a long time ago is a bit of a clich. The photography is astounding anyway. Why did Goetz and some of the others have to speak their lines in a faux German accent? This seems unnecessary - surely in this film they were largely all speaking German? Still this is a small point. The most serious breakdown and something that was apparently made up for the film was Schindler's emotional farewell at the end. It was not in the book, it did not need to be in the film and should not have been. The film would not have been diminished by omitting this faint touch of treacle. What Schindler had done for \\"his\\" Jews was clear - words spelling it all out were just not necessary. But these are small criticisms of a masterpiece.
B000001OAA|5.0|Butch Vig is an alternative rock legend. He's helped produce albums for bands like Nirvana (their seminal NEVERMIND), Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins & Soul Asylum. But I guess maybe he was looking to get a taste of the same success the bands he was producing were having. However, Vig was almost in his 40s, so he may not have been acceptable to the youth-oriented alternative rock scene & fanbase. So he formed a band of his own (in which he took a supporting role as drummer), made up of cracker jack musicians like himself & an enigmatic, sexy, yet talented chanteuse with the intriguing name of Shirley Manson. Thus, you had Garbage, which may have been the name of the band, but the music was far from it.<br />Their 1995 self-titled debut album came along when Nirvana had ended too soon with Kurt Cobain's suicide, Smashing Pumpkins released their landmark double album MELLON COLLIE & THE INFINITE SADNESS & Sonic Youth releasing their own masterpiece WASHING MACHINE. With all those headlining bands, Garbage had their work cut out for them, yet they managed to find a measure of success in their own right & with a sound more conducive to pop radio stations who were reluctant to add alternative to their playlist.<br />\\"Queer\\" was the first song to make it to the public & the title alone was enough to prick up a few ears. But instead of being a song about homophobia, it's about the strange & unknown (the original meaning of the word \\"queer\\"), with Shirley Manson's detached-yet-admirable voice taking the listener into that state of nothingness the song suggested. Songs like \\"Milk\\" (don't ask me what this song is about), the positively-eerie second single \\"Stupid Girl\\" (which I still think is Garbage's best performance thus far) & \\"Fix Me Now\\" are other great examples of Shirley seducing the listener just by the sound of her voice.<br />But the bulk of GARBAGE is chock full of grungy guitar riffs & propulsive rhythms that were so evocative of mid-1990s rock. The third single \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" (with its unlikely hook \\"pour your misery down on me\\"), \\"Not My Idea\\", \\"Dog New Tricks\\" & \\"A Stroke Of Luck\\" prove Ms. Manson can rock with the best of them & even turn a good lyric (I believe she's the band's primary songwriter). Elsewhere, there are songs that point towards the future, like \\"As Heaven Is Wide\\" & \\"My Lover's Box\\", which hint at the more pronounced techno influence that would come into play on VERSION 2.0 (1998) & more recently on BEAUTIFULGARBAGE (2001). While the production by Butch Vig may be a little more stylized & polished than an alternative rock band would want, that in essence helped Garbage find an audience with those pop fans who didn't often tune into alternative rock radio. In the end, it still rocked like hell, too.<br />With an alternately innovative & throwback sound, a looker of a frontwoman & just plain good old-fashioned charisma, Garbage arrived on the music scene in 1995 with a lot of promise. For my money, they've made good on it many times over. However, some fans of their self-titled debut have cried foul at Garbage's journey into techno territory on their two subsequent albums. I think it was only logical, seeing as the production on GARBAGE was more glossy & commercial than NEVERMIND, which helped bring alternative rock out of Seattle & into the world spotlight.<br />GARBAGE was the album that helped make Almo Sounds Records, the new label set up by Herb Alpert after A&M Records, which he also helped found, was swallowed by the Universal-Polygram merger of the time. While one would wonder why an old cat like Alpert would want to get in on the alternative craze of the time, that's what helped make A&M Records a success in the first place: his knack for knowing talent when he saw it & just being in the right place at the right time.<br />That also worked to Garbage's advantage, because for the first time (with the exception of Hole), the female perspective was brought into the previously male-dominated world of alternative rock. Alanis Morissette may have helped a lot also, but Shirley Manson had a lot more femininity than her, making her more palatable to the public. Since then, Garbage has done almost no wrong in my opinion & it all started with a self-titled album that was certainly not garbage in any way, shape or form. Rather, it was a keeper all-around!ed world of alternative rock.

B00003CXXP|3.0|AI I found to be a strangely depressing film, which attempts to graft on a happy ending to something that is manifestly not happy at all. This is the story of an android created to love who is thrown out by his human &quot;mother&quot; and thereafter seeks to refind the love he has lost by both refinding his mother and by becoming a real boy, so as to be worthy of her love. The film started off well and at the beginning at least was intriguing. The effects and the look of the film are excellent and it has very high production values. The end is bizarre and I think unbelievable. However, I can see why it is there: without it, this film would be a painfully depressing experience to watch. However, the rather ridiculous ending does not work and you still feel that the film is unremittingly sad. I am slightly amused by people suggesting that all the good bits of the film are Kubrick's and the bad bits of the film are Spielberg's - is there actually any evidence that this is the case? I think this film in Kubrick's hands could not have been much different. Kubrick did some great films - but not all of them are classics. Maybe Kubrick himself thought the film ultimately would be unsatisfactory? This is a vision of the future where technology has been a &quot;success&quot;, even if society is not. The energy problem has been solved and the people who are around have marvelous things if they are favored. In this sense the film is really not new and is akin to Bladerunner, Alien, Star Wars and all the rest. Curiously unsatisfactory, and I think one can understand precisely why it flopped - the film's gloomy story, with its strange &quot;let out&quot; ending dooms it from long term acceptance as a great, or even a good film.

B0000070QS|5.0|I have been a A-HA fan since 1988. In year 1996 I discovered in one music shop Morten Harkets solo album &quot;Wild Seed&quot;. I both this album and receive very positive and emotional shock I cant describe way, but I now that every people who likes A-Ha must hear those songs. Also I recomend to hear Morten Harkets solo album &quot;Vogts Villa&quot; in norvegian.
B00001OH80|5.0|...<br />My first introduction to David Bowie was with this album and Let's Dance, so there's sentimental value for me in Tonight.  I first saw him performing on HBO's Tina Turner concert in 1985, where he sang \\"Tonight\\" and \\"Let's Dance.\\"<br />Well, naturally, the former song is present on this album, and yes, Tina has some vocal duty here as well.<br />The contrasting times of the Middle East are portrayed in \\"Loving The Alien,\\" which is good in the single version, but here, it's in its full resplendent 7:09 glory.  From the times of the Crusaders, who were promised a place in heaven for fighting the Saracens, to \\"Palestine being a modern problem,\\" (it is something poignantly topical to this day), we see a Middle East ruled by \\"terror in a best laid plan.\\"<br />\\"Don't Look Down\\" is a song with the aura of having a leisurely walk down the streets of uncrowded London, if that's at all possible.  I've always liked his singing in a lower register, which he does for ballads, and his cover of the Beach Boys' \\"God Only Knows\\" is a perfect example of that.<br />There's a little bit of everything here.  The hard rock of \\"Neighborhood Threat,\\" the 50's rock-and-roll of Leiber and Stoller's \\"I Keep Forgettin',\\" and the lazy calypso rhythms of \\"Tumble And Twirl.\\"  I can almost taste the akee and tamarind juice listening to this latter song.<br />The irresistible single \\"Blue Jean\\" is the highlight here, with Carlos Alomar's guitars never more effective.<br />Bowie is in a unique category of artists who keeps changing with each album..., and that's what makes him legendary...Who will like this album?  Bowie fans, because their tastes are the union of those mutually exclusive sets.  And I'm proud to say, I'm one of them.
0811828697|5.0|The collaborative effort of Star Wars experts Terryl Whitlatch and Bob Carrau, The Wildlife Of Star Wars: A Field Guide is an incredible treasure trove supplement and companion to the Star Wars movies, books, and comic book sagas. Filled with wondrous color illustrations on almost every single page, it treats the indigenous and exotic wildlife of alien worlds as a scholastic journal, making note of unusual animal features for the discerning Star Wars connoisseur. A grand and elaborate coffee table book, The Wildlife Of Star Wars is very highly recommended for Star Wars fans and science fiction enthusiasts who enjoy a good extraterrestrial bestiary.
B000022TSW|5.0|It was a little tough figuring out how to rate this. I waited to buy the movie until I had a DVD player and could get the DVD. But for what? There are no extras on the DVD, not even a director's commentary (which seems to be on every DVD available). No fireside chats, no extra footage, no discussion of their time with the MPAA. Nothing. Even Showtime has more extras when they show the movie than the DVD. Now I have to wonder why I waited and just didn't buy it on VHS. They really dropped the ball here.<br />But in the end I have to give the movie the highest rating possible because of the quality of the movie. South Park might just be the most cutting edge tv series ever made. The movie does fall a bit short of the series, but it is still one of the funniest movies made. It satirizes and parodies more things than I can begin to mention. And is a musical, no less (the songs they came up with are worth the price of the movie alone). <br />It's a great movie, I just wish they had done more with the DVD.
031286504X|1.0|Excellent descriptive writing. Unfortunately, there is more description than plot. &quot;I Am Legend&quot; turns out to be more a novella than novel and the paperback contains several unrelated short stories that immediately follow. Regrettably, there are no notes that indicate this arrangement and one finds oneself wading through the short stories (also heavy on description, lean on plot) before realizing that &quot;I Am Legend&quot; ended many pages back.

B00005JKJA|4.0|As huge fan of david lynch i was extremely disappointed in the dvd version of Mulhallond drive. First of all there are no extras in the movie and by far no chapter selections in the movie. I guess he wants the audience and the true fans of his film to see the whole movie and not skip bit and pieces of it that they like. The movie was excellent by all means, plots that make you think before it happens. The movie starts slow at first but it gets better as it ends. Anne Miller gives a very awesome preformance as betty, the struggling actress, as well as Laura Elene Harring as the amenestic &quot;Rita&quot;. I know david lynch purposely made the dvd version without any chapter selection because he wants the viewer to experience the point of his movie and ideas of his creation rather than skip their favorite scene. True it may work, but it will only irritate folks that are use to chapter selection on dvd like myself.

B00005A0N5|5.0|I first listened to samples from this CD when someone told me I should check out Nightwish.  I am into songs with expressive and beautiful vocals like Celine Dion, Enya, and music from Cirque Du Soleil.  I'm happy to say I have found another group to listen to over and over.<br />After listening to samples I knew I had to get this album, &quot;Oceanborn&quot;.  It has so many great tracks.  I would describe the vocals and melody in these tracks as ballads, Epic Metal, Power Opera.  Track 1 sets the pace setting you up for Tarja's voice throughout the whole album.  But you gotta give alot of credit to Toumas who writes the music and plays the synths.  One of my favorite tracks is track 8 &quot;The Riddler&quot; nothing will prepare you for it.  It's the most powerful and joyous track on the CD, and like I said it is like a &quot;Power Ballad&quot;. . it sounds like one of those Finale songs from the Cirque Du Soleil.  That's why I love it so much.  It's like a celebration of life, sound and music.  And if that's what you like in your music, you will love Nightwish.
0553579908|5.0|Even though it seems hardly necessary at this point, I feel the need to extoll George R. R. Martin's work thus far.<br />To be sure, these books are long, longer even than many of the Wheel of Time books.  The first book is about 850 pages and this second installment 100 pages longer still.  But unlike Robert Jordan's books, things actually move along.  There are no dangling plotlines and very little filler.  Yes, there is a lot of extraneous detail, such as what's for dinner and what kind of sex certain characters are having, but not nearly as much as in the Wheel of Time.  And the details in Martin's books are merely sprinkled on, the icing on the cake.  The Wheel of Time is mostly icing and very little cake.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I love mulholland Drive.  i absolutly adore the movie, but this dvd release is the only material thing i have ever seen that actually made me angry.  Not only is there no bonus features.  but theres no scene selection.  What is the point of having a dvd if there is no bonus material or at least a scene selection.  Now the one thing that makes me want to grab every copy of this dvd and destroy it is that its edited.  THE MOVIE IS CENSORED.  They blur out the genitals of one of the lead actresses in one scene.  there is no point in purchasing this dvd.  Wait until theres a unrated \\"special edition\\" or whatever if there even is going to be one.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is simply an incredible album. I'm in college, but as I have older brothers and sisters, I heard this stuff as I was growing up. I find most popular music distasteful in some way or another. This album, however, is proof that passion and energy do not necessarily drag you down into the dredges of society. It's not for snobs, but it's not full of curses or sexual innuendoes either. Joshua Tree both inspires you and makes you happy -- which is what music is supposed to do. <br />The first three songs have obviously left their mark, but the first time I *really* listened to this album, I found each successive song to have great appeal. \\"Bullet the Blue Sky,\\" \\"Running to Stand Still,\\" \\"One Tree Hill,\\" all would qualify as great moments on any other album, although regrettably some people forget about them in the context of Joshua Tree. \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\" is a mellower song (oh my, they don't have to play every song at the same tempo a la Green Day or Blink 182!) and a fitting conclusion to this tremendous album. <br />This is not my favorite album, but definitely up there, but whereas other albums might have two or three \\"down\\" songs, this doesn't have any (that explains my title). So if you are debating about buying this, don't -- it will be well worth your while to get a good copy of this CD. Enjoy!
B000002H6C|5.0|After the death of Cliff Burton, Metallica pressed on with new bassist Jason Newsted and delivered their greatest album here. Every song, from Blackened to Dyers Eve, shows Metallica at the peak of their technichal and songriting abilities.

0345448898|5.0|After reading The Lord of the Rings trilogy (possibly the greatest fantasy story of all time) I was convinced that there would never be another book or set of books in my life as great as Tolkien's masterpiece. How wrong was I. When I took my mom's suggestion to read \\"His Dark Materials\\" I became entranced within the first chapter. I was amazed at how the books kept my attention throughout the entire story. Pullman's vocabulary and imagination was excellent as well.  <BR> In the story the main character, a girl named Lyra is drawn into an epic quest far greater and important than she could imagine. During her adventures and struggles she faces Gobblers  and stolen children, witch clans and armored bears and later, in the second book befriends a boy named Will. Together Lyra, Will and a host of other characters fight for freedom, for life and humanity. The endings are the last things you could ever expect and much, much more. <BR> My recommendation is to read these books! Read them, read them, read them. Don't hesitate. Go out there and by them right now! You won't regret it!!<br />Here are some other great fantasy books for those who do and don't like these ones:<BR> -The Lord of the Rings [books] - by J.R.R. Tolkien<BR> -Redwall [books] - by Brian Jacques<BR> -Harry Potter [books] - by J.K. Rowling
B00005B5L4|5.0|I purchased a dvd-audio player only about 2 weeks ago, but must admit to being hooked on this new format, even though the selections are light right now.  However, in the short time, I have acquired 5 DVD-A discs (including the recently-released Dave Koz DVD-A, which is excellent), and I must say \\"Rumours\\" is just outstanding!!!  Proof that an \\"old\\" recording can sound like it was made on 2002 recording equipment, given the proper medium to present it.  This disc also has the best feature I've yet seen:  a \\"Making Of\\" selection (make sure you get to the main menu: navigation is a little tricky, as usual for DVD-A) wherein you can hear alternate versions (non-vocal tracks, etc) of songs like \\"Silver Springs\\"), all while ALL of the original band members comment on the making of the songs (much like a \\"Director's commentary\\" on a DVD-V).  I hope we see more of this feature in the future, and more of excellently-restored timeless music like on this DVD-A!!
6303433766|5.0|When I heard Peter Jackson would be helming The Lord of the Rings trilogy, I knew it was in good hands, and that's based only on his work on HEAVENLY CREATURES. Jackson and Walsh was robbed of the Best Original Screenplay in 1995, the *only* Oscar nod this wonderful movie received.<br />HEAVENLY CREATURES was my favorite film of 1994. At the time, the \\"hype\\" was about the girls' \\"homosexuality\\". This completely missed the point. HEAVENLY CREATURES takes the true life story of murder and turns it into an engrossing and exasperating portrait of deep true love, love that defies all, love that shifts the world around you, love that most \\"lovers\\" never achieve. Despite the deadly outcome, one is envious of the love between these two girls. It is love that is exhuberant and defiant. The kind of love one can only dream to experience once in a lifetime.<br />The imaginary world of Pauline and Juliet is beautifully realized. The use of special effects is subtle and delightful, a true embedding of FX in the service of story and not because it \\"looks cool\\".<br />Since we know what the ultimate outcome is from the very beginning, the film doesn't play an \\"ah-ha\\". Instead it is all about showing us what is within the minds of these two girls and the relentless approach of the inevitable that drives the movie. <br />To echo what another reviewer said, HEAVENLY CREATURES is one of the few films that really stuck with me. Driving home in the dark, I kept muttering to myself 'Oh my god...' I was emotionally drained for several days afterward.
B0000251VP|4.0|This is my first Maiden enhanced CD.  Unbelievable extras!!  The multimedia studio did a top notch job.  The menu system and layout are extremely well done and the graphics are everything you'd expect from a Maiden production.  Derek Riggs would be proud!<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the video clips, though the resolution was a little low.  Phantom has always been a personal favorite.<br /><br />I also really appreciated that they included everything you need to view the multimedia portion of the disk, right on the disk.  I only have dial-up access so it's painful when you have to wait a while to see something because the download takes forever.<br /><br />Otherwise all the audio trimmings you'd expect from the original Iron Maiden album.<br /><br />My only complaint, and thus the 4 stars instead of 5, is my old Sony Discman refuses to recognize this as an audio CD.  So I can't listen to it outside of my computer.  I haven't experimented further with that yet to see if it's the disk or my player, but I would guess it's my player.  It's only 7 years old...

B00005OM4N|5.0|I think that this new CD by Miss Britney is wonderful.  The lyrics are stronger than on her previous albums and she has better command of her voice.  \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Overprotected\\" are two overlooked gems on this CD.  The best song on here, in my opinion, is \\"I'm not a girl..\\", Britney shows that she can sing a slower paced song as well as the more upbeat numbers.<br />This is a must-have for all of her fans as well as for anyone who wants to hear the current sound of pop.  I think Britney is going to be around for awhile.

B00005JKYS|5.0|We Were Soldiers is by far one of the best war films ive ever seen and the best about Vietnam. It shows the loyalty and effects before the political corruptions. It also does not favor either side, it simply shows the war from the angle of soldiers, both American and Vietnamese. Rated R for strong brutal, pervasive war violence, and some strong language. An emotionally moving film with the most powerful last twenty minuted ive ever seen. Recommended for everyone. Also, a special thanks for every human being that fought in Vietnam, your country and I owe you everything.

0525946284|2.0|This is one of the silliest, most implausible books I've ever read.  I certainly expected more from Follett, who has written some real winners.  Commanding officers referring to a group of spies as \\"girls\\", the main character making ridiculously emotional choices while she's in command of a supposedly vital, world changing operation -- well, that's how it goes, through the whole book.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  We know he's capable of better writing.  This is a rip off.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen. Focusing on troubled teenager Donnie Darko, this movie is set in the month of Oct. 1988, amid the political backdrop of the Bush/Dukakis election.<br />Late one October night, Donnie has a dream about a six foot tall, nightmarish bunny named Frank, who tells Donnie that the world is going to end on Oct. 30. He returns home to find a jet engine lodged into his bedroom, an engine that no-one can trace.<br />The next day at school, Donnie encounters Gretchen, a beautiful girl with a troubled past. She and Donnie become friends.<br />Meanwhile, the school is preparing for a visit by a New Age philosopher named Jim Cunningham (brilliantly played by Patrick Swayze) who tells people that he can eliminate their fear.<br />Madness or prophecy? That's the question we are forced to ask ourselves at each turn, every time that Donnie has a vision of Frank.<br />Donnie confronts Jim Cunningham at a school assembly, seeing past the man's empty promises. Donnie tells Jim that he is \\"the AntiChrist\\".<br />All the while, Donnie is obsessed with the idea of time travel, fueled by a book written by a woman he knows, a woman who has told him that all creatures on this Earth will die alone.<br />Haunted by strange visions, Donnie is aware of the ever-approaching deadline for the end of the world, falling more and more in love with Gretchen.<br />I can't say much more without spoiling the ending of the film, but I will say this. Donnie Darko is a romantic suspense film about sacrifice and redemption.<br />And the DVD itself is full of extras, with twenty deleted scenes, a mock infomercial about Jim Cunningham and his philosophy, cast bios, a beautiful music video, and pages from the book The Philosophy of Time Travel.<br />With no gratuitous violence, nudity, or gore, this film is purely driven by the characters and their circumstances, and I recommend it to anyone who likes to think for themselves.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I would have given this movie three stars if Spielberg and Kubrick had not been involved in it.  However, the fact that they were make this movie a much larger disappointment.  Yes, it has some good visual effects, but the plot is weak, unentertaining (i.e. boring) and much longer than necessary.  Just when you think the movie is finally over, there comes another subplot, more intolerable than the previous one.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Not knowing much about the movie when we took our eight year old to see it, we were plesantly surprised by the wit and humor of the script. Some may consider the humor and wordplay mildly crude but it is delightful for youngsters.  I personally enjoyed the earwax scene.   The film's animation is superb and the soundtrack is alot of fun.  Overall the film is very entertaining.

I'll limit myself <BR>to the following:<br />     It made two truck loads of money.<br />     It permitted an onslaught of cynical marketing in its name.<br />     It failed to meet the expectations of its fans.<br />     As for the first item, raking in the cash is no big deal <BR>these days; it reveals nothing either way about the quality of <BR>the film involved.  As for the second, to have expected no marketing <BR>campaign, or even a reasonable one, would have been presuming to <BR>understand the incredibly complex, avaricious and unstoppable engine <BR>of greed that powers the corporate multiplex of interconnected media.  <BR>It may or may not have been within George Lucas's ability to control; <BR>at any rate, I honestly doubt that Lucas's primary intent in revisiting <BR>his galaxy far, far away was to make sure that he had sixty katrillion <BR>dollars instead of thirty.<br />     But on to more pressing matters.<br />     One's ability to enjoy 'Phantom Menace', I suppose, depends <BR>greatly on how invested one was in the original trilogy.  For <BR>someone like myself--white, early thirties--the investment is <BR>considerable.  So, like many of my ilk, I do not like this film.  <BR>I don't like its cartoonishness.  I don't like how it plays fast <BR>and loose with Star Wars icons.  I particularly don't like the <BR>sloppy script.<br />     And, like just about everybody, casual fans included, I <BR>hate the fact Lucas seems to have abandoned the character-based <BR>formula that powered the original trilogy, opting instead for a <BR>political/historical canvas of sorts.<br />     But I can also see things in this film that nobody, not even <BR>its apologists, ever seems to mention.<br />     How about Lucas's technical virtuosity?  How about the film's <BR>gentle good-nature?  (I'd give a big wad of cash to anyone who disproves <BR>my theorythat 'The Phantom Menace' is the only major American release <BR>of the last twenty years to include not a single sarcastic moment or <BR>line of dialogue.)  I seem to be the only person, fans of the film <BR>included, who seems aware of, and grateful for, the deliberately <BR>old-fashioned feel to this film.  (Perhaps one of the reasons that <BR>popular bane, Jar Jar Binks, bothers me so little is that he's easier <BR>to deal with if you've seen as many old westerns, B serials, and war <BR>films as I have, each with their own similarly broad comic relief.)<br />     Much more distracting to me were the action sequences in the <BR>film that were scuttled by inappropriate \\"humor\\" that had nothing <BR>to do with Jar Jar.  The kid in the space battle going \\"Waaaah!\\" <BR>like Macauley Culkin, or the two headed announcer who absolutely <BR>ruins the pod race.  Action scenes are the bread and butter of <BR>Star Wars, and that sort of tinkering is unforgivable.<br />     It's maddening.  'The Phantom Menace' is a maddening movie, <BR>a film of endlessly annoying details and flawed conceits built <BR>upon an artful, learned, and heartfelt skeleton of ideas and <BR>intentions. <br />     That seems to be my final verdict.<br />     As I write this, Episode II is only a few weeks from release.  <BR>I have no doubt that, like 'Phantom Menace', most of the movie-going <BR>public will like it well enough, but not love it.  And, like any <BR>number of Star Wars die-hards out there, I will love it at its <BR>core . . . <br />     . . . and not like it much.<br />     PEOPLE WHO'LL LIKE THIS MOVIE: nobody George meant to, <BR>DVD collectors, ... the overly sentimental (like myself).<br />     PEOPLE WHO WONT LIKE THIS MOVIE: anyone who can't stand kids <BR>in their action movies; anyone owning a Boba Fett action figure.
B00003CY6M|3.0|Serendipity means accidentally finding something fortunate when you aren't looking for it. In this movie, what Jonathan and Sarah [John Cusack and Kate Beckinsdale] find is each other. They meet in a department store and spend a magical New York evening together. She, thinking their encounter is too good to be true, decides to tempt fate. She has him write his phone number on a five dollar bill, which she promptly turns around and spends. Then she writes her address inside a book that she sells the next day. The couple parts, leaving whether or not they will meet again to destiny. Flash forward a few years. Each has found someone they plan to marry, but the memory of that chance encounter haunts them. Did they willfully let their one chance for Great Romance pass them by? Does Fate believe in second chances?<br />This is a sweet film, which suffers a bit by being almost too light and airy. It presents a very stylized and whimsical view of love and romance. Those who like their movies with a lot of sugar should be charmed. Others, of course, may find themselves gagging over this cinematic dessert.
0871137380|5.0|Best piece of military history I have read.  Reads like a novel.  Great character development and detail of the sounds, smells, and sights of battle.  Maps in book are helpful to follow the action.
630505116X|5.0|The legacy of A-list films like Aliens have led to B-movies of this sort (action-horrors) having several basic requirements: an assortment of deliberately overblown characters; a brooding, highly-stylised setting; a monster that has adapted to that setting so that they have a strategic advantage over the humans; inventive and memorable death sequences as the central group is reduced in number one by one; a secondary problem to overcome that is usually time-based; an invincible hero who faces everything with the same witty calm and oozes cool; and huge, beautiful guns that fire a thousand rounds a minute. Deep Rising embraces every one of these critieria, and then some.<br />Every dial in this film has been cranked up to the max. The action comes thick and heavy, the plot sears along at a blistering pace, the dialogue sparkles, the character dynamics spin back and forth - every single scene has several things happening concurrently. There is nothing extraneous to the simple pleasure of taking the spectator on a thrill-ride that involves hairbreadth escapes, intricate possibilities for romantic liaisons, and an ever-present possibility of an over-the-top, cheer-inducing death. Obviously, this is not a serious film. It is not high-art and nor will it probably ever be mentioned in a book on film theory, but in terms of sheer enjoyment, it gives the majority of big-budget action blockbusters a run for their money. The writer, director, cinematographers, actors and producers certainly know what appeals to their audience and how best to target them - there is nothing in this film that is not `cool'. From Treat Williams' joystick-operated boat to the tomb-like interiors of the ship, from the costumes to the dialogue and set-pieces, from the weaponry to the monsters themselves, everything has been calculated to garner the most enjoyable reaction. Everybody gets their just desserts in incredibly imaginative and memorable ways, the truly unique CGI monsters blur the boundaries between reality and animation, and the big guns that dish out the retribution are simply awesome.<br />A movie that caters directly to your interests and expectations for a film is certainly something that is going to be a success, and Deep Rising is this on every level - cool, fast-moving, high-octane, huge-scale entertainment. It doesn't fall into the trap of most of these films - killing off too many people too quickly or not quickly enough - and lets it all pan out a satisfying and thrilling pace. And it's great to see X-Men's Famke Jansson and Gladiator's Djimon Hounsou in early roles that will probably be expunged from the CV at any future awards ceremonies. Watch it and enjoy!between reality and animation, and the big guns that dish out the retribution are simply awesome. <br />A movie that caters directly to your interests and expectations for a film is certainly something that is going to be a success, and Deep Rising is this on every level - cool, fast-moving, high-octane, huge-scale entertainment.

B00003CXXP|4.0|This movie is less than the sum of its parts, but even though it is problematic, it still rewards the viewer's attention.<br />The Pinnochio theme is obvious from the outset, but so is the cinematic debt the film and its makers owe to Blade Runner.  Like Blade Runner, A.I. deals with the interaction between human and android (sorry, replicant) and the humanism and ethics, or lack thereof, that apply to such relationships.<br />Haley Joel Osment is a marvel in the role of David, the mechanical prototype boy who is \\"adopted\\" by a couple whose only child lies in an apparently irredeemable coma.  The odyssey of this family, and of David, in a future society that is breaking down and rebuilding itself right and left, continues until the last moment.<br />Osment is the linchpin of A.I.  This child is amazingly talented and can lift up virtually any material on his little shoulders. If George Lucas had hired him to play the young Anakin Skywalker, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace would have had some depth.  Osment's performance in one gut-wrenching scene is so true it's literally painful to watch; expect to need more Kleenex long after the scene is over. <br />The film is hindered by some standard sticking points, among them sci-fi economics (in which the world is mostly destroyed -- and yet people live in huge, architecturally unique houses with nice landscaping; certain common products, such as perfume, become incredibly precious because they cannot be replaced -- and yet people seem to be quite wasteful of many resources), a broken-backed format in which new characters are suddenly introduced and the others virtually forgotten, and a kind of nervous breakdown (and bizarre deus ex machina) in the last reel in which A.I. sort of becomes a different film entirely.  <br />The latter structural problem is no doubt due to the untimely death of Stanley Kubrick, who had handed the project over to Steven Spielberg.  Kubrick's influence is seen through most of the film, until, toward the end, Spielberg pours on his (arguably worst) influence 110%.<br />The special effects are outstanding, but it is Haley Joel Osment who makes this film worth the time and money.
6304510861|4.0|It's difficult to review this film because of my opposing views about it. The first time I saw it, I absolutely loved it and thought it to be the best film I'd ever seen. The second time I watched it, it came across as a self-indulgent, average tale that had a few good moments but was overall a waste of time.<br />Taking on Freud's essay on the Uncanny, David Lynch concocts a bizarrely absorbing tale of doppelgangers, the unhomely home, and reversion to primitive fantasies. Indeed, it is so `uncanny' that the first time you watch it, it is deeply unsettling, and everything contained in it has the power to be creepy (it is incredible how scary someone with no eyebrows can be). What keeps you watching is that you have absolutely no idea what is going on, and yet the creepy vibe holds it together and keeps you desperate to reach the ending. Knowing how the film resolves (or frankly doesn't), however, takes a hell of a lot of the fun out of watching it a second time. Without the desire to discover how it all fits together, there is little within the stories themselves to entertain and enthral. Balthusser Getty, whilst good to look at (as he is, perhaps, Pullman's fantasy of a virile, potent young man), can't act worth a dime, and Bill Pullman's low-key performance prevents us from feeling any empathy with him. With no one to identify with except Patricia Arquette's femme fatale, whose character is so non-existent you can't really identify with her anyway, it is a fine work of intellectualism and great to talk about afterwards, but in terms of movie-making, it is dull, lacking in spectacle and entertainment, and has few of the quirks of, say, `Blue Velvet.'<br />I have given `Lost Highway' four stars, because of how much I enjoyed it the first time around. However, I would recommend seeing it at least twice before buying it, because I was amazed at how poorly I received it on the second viewing. The fact that the chronology of the film is kind of circular, unless it is all Pullman's fantasy, whilst stunning when you discover it, is merely illogical when you apply it to stringent scrutiny. Leaving more questions than answers is no bad thing, provided it is possible for the audience to come up with their own answers - in this case, it is more than impossible to answer any of the questions, so it is a thoroughly unsatisfactory experience. However, if all you desire is to see Patricia Arquette strip for the camera every few minutes, Henry Rollins hamming it up (as usual), and Bill Pullman miming some truly terrible saxophone-playing, this is the film for you.ll Pullman's fantasy, whilst stunning when you discover it, is merely illogical when you apply it to stringent scrutiny.

B00005JT6F|5.0|This album was released in mid 2001 in Australia & New Zealand, and to rave reveiws. Going platinum in N.Z. and a chart climber in Australia, there's no doubt that hardcore America fans should have this in their collection. A spin off to the U.S. release of the \\"Complete Greatest Hits\\" and the 3 CD Box set entitled \\"Highway 30 years\\".<br />A fantastic album to have in any collection - one of their best!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Baz Luhrmann does a wonderful job of giving audiences a feast for the eyes, and ears. Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman did fantastic with the songs. The first time I heard Ewan sing I was swept off my feet.A must see for all his fans.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Finally, a movie I couldn't figure out halfway through!<BR>If you are looking for something completely different, a film interesting on many, many levels, try this one.  Guy Pearce is entrancing as the memory-impaired Leonard, and Carrie-Anne Moss is sultrier than ever.  And just wait til the ending! (Or is it the beginning...)
B00003CXTG|2.0|I like love stories, but this one made me sick!<BR>The love triangle took away from the real story.
B00005UQ9F|3.0|I was reading about this film in the magazine from last year's &quot;Fantasia&quot; film festival in Montreal and it sounded intriguing.  Much to my dismay this film turned out to be an unoriginal entry into the suspense/horror/thriller genre.  The story is well written and the camera work/set design are pretty cool.  I just found there were some loose ends, some areas of the film that should have been dealt with in more detail.  This film could have been incredible but it ended up being so so.
630575067X|5.0|\\"A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...\\"  was the classic phrase used three times back in the late seventies to early eighties in an introduction to a phenomenon so great it shattered all box-office records in those days.  STAR WARS enlightened the many, young and old, geeky and non, etc, and George Lucas, the director, when he had completed the three part series, he hinted that he was planning on another STAR WARS project that would probably be introduced to the people when technology is at its best.<BR>    Well, technology is DEFINITELY at its best now.  And when THE PHANTOM MENACE hit theaters on May 17, 1999, it was the loudest, biggest, baddest, and ultimate movie of the year.  It smashed ALL records, including its ancestor \\"A New Hope\\", but people left not satisfied, but as if they had just left from another mediocre film.<BR>   I must admit though I enjoy STAR WARS, I felt that \\"The Phantom Menace\\" was not the best work that George had done.  Maybe he was beginning to get the hang of it again.  For all I know, he definitely took advantage of the special effects and the martial arts, but that was basically it.  Natalie Portman's acting was not as good as her usual, and Jar Jar Binks, well, I just wanted to attain a laser gun and shoot him.<BR>   Well, two years passed, and now the film has been released on DVD, the first of the six movies to be remastered onto a disc.  And George MOST DEFINITELY took advantage of the DVD's capabilities, packing it full with up to 6 hours of behind-the-scenes footage, documentaries, and extras.  I just loved it, and, of course, I watched it for six hours straight.  This movie, though mediocre, was amazing on DVD, and I recommend it to all those who wish to come closer to the Force.<BR>   Three years has passed, and now the sequel is on its way.  I have seen the trailers, and, I'm telling you, this movie is definitely darker and deeper than the first, and it will be an excellent film for all to watch.  I'm not tellin you nuttin', because I want you to watch the film instead.
6305311463|3.0|Although I think the movie is an over-loud, completely illogical and fairly disorienting piece of Hollywood claptrap, as far as big Summer blockbusters go it's hard to beat Armageddon. But I wanted to add a large, hairy and potentially sales-limiting aside to all the other reviews. If you're upgrading to a widescreen TV thinking this DVD will showcase the new technological wonders of prograssive scan and 16x9 flat screens you'll be sorely disappointed when you find that there is no anamorphic version on this disc. That's right, friends, even with all the other extras, they couldn't be bothered to include the one feature that truly showcases the cinematography and special effects (which are, let's face it, this film's halmarks cuz it sure ain't the acting and script). On a widescreen TV, Criterion's Armageddon provides black bars above, below and side to side yielding a postcard view of the &quot;big screen&quot; action.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Ever since I saw Eraserhead back in the early 80's I have been an avid Lynchian fanatic. I am always taken to another place when ever I see a Lynch film ... only Lynch knows that place and can give me the directions so clearly as if he owns a map of my mind. I am at this moment studying film at University here in the UK and there is no doubt about it, Lynch is my inspiration for where I am today. Here in England I recently saw Mulholland Drive at the cinema on a Monday night, Tuesday night and Thursday night in the same week. I WAS BLOWN AWAY! It has everything and was a ticket to 'that DREAM place'! If you are a Lynch fan you will be an extremely Happy Chappy ... even if you do not class Lynch as a Fav ... give this a go, its bloody great! As for the DVD (just got mine today) it fantastic! Lovely picture, and clean crisp sound pouring out of my 5 speakers ... you hear sounds you never heard at the cinema. As for the extras ... well I would have loved interviews with the cast, but to be quite honest no matter what, this movie is a treat. As for other reviewers here, they seem to keep mentioning the missing chapter search. Come on guys, is this such a problem? I quote from David Lynch himself on the inner sleave of the wonderful Straight Story<BR>'It is my opinion that a film is not like a book - it should not be broken up. It is a continuum and should be seen as such'<BR>So come on guys, love this DVD, just look at the picture, listen to the sound and most of all ENJOY THIS WONDERFUL MOVIE.<br />Cheers
B000002U8G|5.0|I give this record five stars on the basis that 'Echoes' alone is worth at least 50 stars.<br />Despite having played the 23 minute 31 seconds 'Echoes' almost every day for more than a year (I was a student then), I was still finding something new at each listening. Over 10 years later, I retired my vinyl copy and bought the CD, and suddenly there were even more new things to find. <br />I have to disagree with other reviewers. Apart from 'One of these days' the other tracks are embarasingly forgetable. But don't be put off, this ranks with 'Wish you were here' as one of the Floyd's true works of genius.
B00005QK3B|5.0|I never tire of this CD.  For some reason, no one else has ever come up with dreamier music.  Some of the musical interludes here need to be heard to be believed.  Steve Rothery's guitar lines handle the majority of the melodies, and in spite of the fact that he's not a flashy player, his solos are beautiful and PERFECT.  Most of the songs tie in together and Fish's great lyrics & music are inspired and adventurous. If you're ready to be taken on a audio journey, look no further than this and get it before it's out of print.
B000063DI9|5.0|i usually don't write reviews on landmark albums(no need to usually), but i have to put my 2 cents in on this one. i have been listening to maiden since i was 13, 17 years ago. i remember when 7th son first came out, maiden was already beginning to be regarded as &quot;old news&quot; by then. newer bands like slayer and metallica had come in with a new form of metal, thrash. and maiden had experimented with keyboards on this album. the underlying feeling in the metal world was they &quot;sold out&quot;. my how wonderful a thing hindsight is, because now the metal world regards 7th son as the best album they ever did, and i agree. i felt that way back then when all my headbanger friends were jumping on the thrash bandwagon. i loved thrash as well but as far as i was concerned then and now, maiden were the kings. this album is their best even though it wasn't recieved well at the time. i think people realize how well its aged since then.
B00003CXBK|4.0|This is a must see its a long but sweet movie you will wanna see it over and over.
0345448898|5.0|I think that even if you hate the genre of fantasy or science fiction, or how ever you feel that this book should be catergorized, that you should go and buy the whole series right now. Philip Pullman spins a remerkable web of characters and events that will make your head spin. I think that I have never read a book so many times or a whole series for that matter. This book is amazing from the idea of daemons, to dust, to Lira and Will which are the best characters in any literature I have ever read. If you can group characters as 3-D, 2-D and so on. I think that Mr. Pullman has effectively created a new dimension of depth and perspective. I feel like I have known these characters all my life. This is not an ordinary series that will deal with things already talked about, no this series enters uncharted places. It doesn't matter if you are just learning to read, 80, 20, 10, or anywhere in between. Read this book or you will be missing out on something extraordinary. Do yourself this favor.
B0000057C5|5.0|Rammstein's second album, and their North American debut, Rammstein offered a powerful and morbid yet pleasant. Du Hast will always pump me up, with it's pulsing drums put forth by Christoph Schnieder, and haunting vocals by Till Lindgren (sp?). My favorite song on the Cd though would have to be Bestrafe Mich (Punish Me), it is the most epic sounding Rammstein song, and the tone in Till's vocals changes from angry to enraged to subtle and back to angry in the span of one verse, amazing. Pick this one up whether you're new to Rammstein or are missing this jewel from the crown that is your Rammstein collection.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|Sam Raimi's first film is this fantastic and scary horror movie. Bruce Campbell plays Ash who along with four other friends go into the woods for a camping trip. While there they find in the basement a taperecorder, knife, shotgun, and a book labeled The Book Of The Dead. It seems that the last person there was trying to decifer the book and in doing so he say's awoke evil spirts. After playing the tape with some chanting and reading from the book we see somthing in the woods. Later Ash's sister is attacked in the woods by the tree's and woods themselves. The movie gets scarier after that and Raimi takes us on a really fun ride. There is a lot of blood and gore but it is really well done and never really distracting. The make-up for a low budget film is very good and affective. The acting is much better than you normally expect from a movie of this kind. The story is also pretty scary in itself. It's not just you'r typical \\"lets go into the woods to fool around\\" movie  Now Raimi would make two more of these films, Evil Dead 2 and Army Of Darkness, but both of those films went for camp and not so much horror, both were very good films but this one remains a real diamond. This movie is graphic however and is for one fans that really want a good scare. All others may want the rent another movie.....
0679805273|5.0|I love this book! In his inimitable Dr. Seuss style, you are told that you have your own mind, and you have your own destiny, and you ultimately have the power within you to determine where your brains and feet will take you. Life is a choice. You can let it happen to you or you can experience it on your own terms. It is a wonderful thing for children of all ages to be aware of. I wish I would have read this book 20 years ago! I read it every night, and I love reading it to my niece and nephew! Dr. Seuss ROCKS!
B00005RFQ5|4.0|The writing, musicianship and vocals on this CD are strikingly superior to most everything else out there, and refreshing in an era where blandness and conformity have a hammerlock on today's corporate radio.  Still, Prince can't resist shooting himself in the foot (and in our ear) with a truly MADDENING altered-voice spiritual narration at the start of most tracks.  If not for that, this could well have been Prince's best album yet.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is truly one of the Disney studios finest moments.  As we all know, it is the only animated film nominated for a Best Picture Oscar more than ten years before the animated feature received its own category.  And now this classic finally comes to DVD.  It looks as though Disney is doing the right thing, packing this two disc set with extras and three (count them, three) versions of the film.  The original theatrical release will be on disc one as well as the recent IMAX re-release and the early rough cut of the film.   The IMAX release contains the added \\"Human Again\\" sequence that was animated especially for the tenth anniversary re-release of the film.  While the song was recorded when the film was originally in production, the animation was never completed.  The new sequence was animated especially for the re-release almost ten years after the original film was completed.  Disney spent an unprecedented amount of money restoring this film, cleaning up scenes and character heads that didn't translate well to the enormous IMAX format.  Other than the obvious musical sequence, the changes are pretty transparent.  Fans of the film might recognize some of the subtle, almost transparent alterations but most will go unnoticed.  The rough cut of the film is a nice addition.  This was the version of the film that was shown to test audiences months before the final film was released.  At the time, such a sneak peek was unheard of and somewhat pioneering.  The initial reaction to the film was more than positive from children and film critics alike.  This same rough cut was also released in the VHS Special Edition when the film originally debuted on video.  The rough cut does show some nice insights into the process of animating.  It alternates between black and white sketches, clean line drawings, painted stills and finished animation.  The jumps are a little jarring at first.  It's more for obsessive fans and students of animation than the average movie watcher.   But I applaud Disney for releasing it with this special edition.  The rest of the extras on disc two are more of the same stuff Disney has been doing to beef up their DVD releases.  The sing-alongs, akward and slow \\"games\\", and their usual run of the mill Making of series are included.  At times, these bits and piece offer an interesting glimpse into the Disney process but more often than not they simply review the same \\"process of animation\\" reel that they did back when Walt was still around.  Hopefully, Disney will soon tire of these same old fillers and develop something truly pioneering for the DVD format.  The same savy they showed with the Snow White DVD, an impressive archive of the films history, should be spread out to their other classics as they become available on the DVD market.  Part of me thinks they're holding back so they have something else to add when they start releasing second generations of these DVDs as they did with Peter Pan earlier this year.  Either way, this Beauty and the Beast edition is well worth the purchase even if the extras are not.  Let's keep our fingers crossed for Aladdin and The Lion King.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out in September, and it is still my favorite CD 7 months later. There is something about this CD that takes you back in time. You feel like you are walking the streets of New York in 1979 when glam and fast, loud rock was all the rage. Lets just say you need to buy this CD as soon as possible. This is only their first Cd and The Strokes are going to only get better.  Modern Age, the second song, is without a doubt the best track on the disc!!
0783225547|5.0|I saw DANTE'S PEAK in science class and it's very good! Pierce Brosnan (the new James Bond), stars as Harry Dalton, a geologist (an expert on volcanos) who comes to this beautiful town in Washington state that's highly populated to research a volcano next to the town which is said to be extinct, but Harry discovers that this volcano is still active, and it's only a matter of short time when this volcano will erupt. Harry tries to get the town's attention, but hardly anybody believes him except for the town's mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), until it is too late. Now, Harry does whatever he can to save Rachel (whom he's secretly falling in love with), her two young children, and the children's grandmother and get them out of the town and far away from the volcano. Harry desparately tries to get Rachel and her family to safety because several years ago, his wife died while they were trying to escape another erupting volcano and doesn't want the same thing happening to Rachel. <br />Yes, this is a natural disaster movie and some of it is politically incorrect, but it is still a fun movie to watch. The performances are especially excellent, especially by Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, and the two children. The visual and sound effects are truly superb and a thrill ride! There is a good storyline to it, as well. DANTE'S PEAK will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br />This collector's edition DVD is awesome! It has behind-the-scenes, deleated scenes, interviews, and much more. The sound on the DVD is top quality, and so is the picture quality. If you are into natural disaster flicks, then DANTE'S PEAK is for you!
0671027573|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read.  Not only did I laugh (literally outloud!), but the book had some incredible love scenes and completely exciting thriller scenes.  The end is a complete twister that you don't figure out until Linda Howard finally reveals the mystery.  Jaine is truly someone to strive to be like.. she is strong, sexy and extremely smart.  She is the type of woman everyone should strive to be... very assure of herself and very confident in who she is.  Sam... yum yum!  I think Sam completed every aspect of Mr. Perfect.  The story will have you laughing one minute, scared the next, and curling your toes at the incredible love scenes with Jaine and Sam.  Enjoy!
0553573403|5.0|I think its funny that some of the people who have claimed to read this book and than say like they \\"heard it all before,\\" etc. To me I think you should read the book before you jump to conclusions about it because first off it tends to make you [look foolish] when you do a review about a book you havn't read.<br />Also if the people who gave this book a bad review could explain exactly why they didn't like it and have it make since. For instance one person said that he couldn't stand all the politics in the book. Well first off I get kind of sick and tired of books that are just sword and sorcery without any form of intellictual thought. Besides this series is more than just about politics, (yet more people that hate this series that need to pick it up).<br /> The characters are very realistic as well as the fighting and the knights are much more realistic than the Arthurian legends. Almost all of the knights are the exact oppisite infact which was something that bothered me about Arthurian fantasy litature. I recommend this series to those who are tired of the Sword And Sorcery [stuff] or good always winning.
B00005UKE0|5.0|I was relunctant to purchase 'All things must pass' at first. None of the Beatles solo efforts ever impressed me that much. They all seemed to lack the inspiration, and energy that the Beatles as a band always seemed to put out.<BR>'All things must pass' though is different. Harrison gets his first chance to shine without the Lennon-McCartney shadow hanging over him, and proves what a great songwriter he truly was.<BR>The album is basically low toned, with few rockers, or loud songs on it, instead you get a chance to see the real George Harrison, sensitive, gental and quiet.<BR>The entire album is great, but my personal favorites include &quot;Isn't it a pity&quot;, &quot;I'd have you anytime&quot; and the title track.<BR>It is a pity the Harrison has recently passed on, my he rest in peace.<BR>George Harrison 1943-2001
0380788624|4.0|Nerds will  love it. I  am a nerd. It's a humorous insight into the lives of computer programmers, soldiers, cryptologists, and grandmothers. After a somewhat sloggish character development, Stephenson turned this into a believable war/love/techno saga spanning three generations and sixty years. I didn't give it 5-stars due to the overabundant gratuitous prepubescent language, and the infomercial-type lessons sprinkled throughout, which distracted from the action (e.g.: how to eat Cap'n Crunch.)  Mostly very enjoyable!
B000006TRV|4.0|'The Wall' is a remarkable album. It was also the last Floyd album to feature all four members, Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason, and Richard Wright because Waters pretty much forced Wright to leave during the making of this album.<BR>On any note, the tone of this album is what makes it stand out from the rest. At any moment a beautiful ballad can make a 180 degree turn into a dark and lonley world inside the wall.<BR>The best songs on this album are &quot;In the flesh?&quot;, &quot;Mother&quot;, and of course the radio friendly yet not totally commercial &quot;Another brick in the wall (pt.2) and &quot;Comfortably numb&quot;.<BR>Waters pretty much takes helm on this album, but co-producer Bob Ezrin tried his best to keep it from being a Roger Waters solo album, which is how &quot;Comfortably numb&quot; made it onto the album.<BR>I would suggest this album to anyone who is interested in Floyd, and is old enough to follow the concept storyline that this album tells.
B000003BF1|5.0|That's right Scott Henkels (previous reviewer) &quot;to each his own&quot;. Why do jazz fanatics always try to compare Rock n Roll with jazz? This is a 'ROCK N ROLL MASTERPIECE' not a jazz piece. Comparing the two is ridiculous. This whole idea of how much harder is to play jazz than rock n roll is a very tiring subject. Jazz to most people is boring and self indulgent. You know what ceases to amaze me Scott Henkels? It's that Jazz buffs such as yourself feel the need to point out how superior your musical tastes are to us poor uneducated Rock n Roll lovers. You should get out more, Scott. I know there's quite a few partys going on this weekend, but they're probably playing Stones records.
B000003B6J|5.0|I can not think of a CD that has had so much influence on American popular culture like the NWA's &quot;Straight OUtta Compton&quot;. THis CD came out in the late 80s, yet it influenced the entire decade of the 90s and its influence is still felt today in 2002. <BR>There were countless rappers who tried to copy the NWA sound and style. There were hundreds of movies that borrowed elements from the NWA like &quot;Menace II Society&quot; and &quot;Boyz NDa Hood&quot;(which by the way was taken from an NWA song). Gangsta rap changed everything in American society. ANd the NWA were the originators and inventors of gangsta rap. THey put the spotlight on their hometown of Compton, California. A vicious crime-ridden neighborhood in the Watts area of South Central L.A. But what about the music? Does it hold up to the test of time? The answer is a resounding &quot;YES&quot;! The raps and the beats are still as fresh as they were more than a decade ago. THe anti-police anthems like &quot;F**K da Police&quot; and &quot;Straight outta Compton&quot; sound just as furious as they did in 1989. But what makes this CD the classic that it is, is the NWA themselves! The NWA was a collection of 4 of the best rappers ever: Ice Cube, Eazy E, Dr. Dre, and MC Ren. <BR>OUt of the 4, Eazy E was my personal favorite, but everyone involved in this CD does a tremendous job. The raps, the beats, it all flows. The music stands up to multiple listenings. If you are not a rap fan you still must own this CD. This CD is a part of American history and culture. Its a CD that will be around forever. And like I said its the most influential piece of music that has come out in the last 20 years and that's saying a lot!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Brilliantly done.  Innovative (and I'm a fairly hard sell because I don't believe that &quot;different&quot; always means &quot;good&quot;).  The characters are well formed and very cohesive, which is a feat in the average movie but in this format is even more impressive.  <br />One word of warning - do not watch this if you can't commit to it completely for the entire length of the movie.  If you're the type of person who half watches while paying bills or cleaning the house, don't even bother with the movie.  You'll hate it.  The details are many and missing one can throw the entire movie off.  This has to be watched without distraction to be appreciated.<br />One of the few DVD's I've felt compelled to actually own.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I saw Andrew's video for \\"Party Hard\\" a week or so ago, and although it wasn't bad, I didn't pay much attention to it. Apparently neither did anyone else, because I Get Wet was released last November and it barely made a mark on the charts, if it broke into the charts at all. It was re-released on and I really don't think it should be ignored again like it was originally.<br />I Get Wet isn't full of pulsating rock like that of System Of A Down or Kittie (for example). Andrew's style is more like Anthrax meets Van Halen...in order words, speed metal combined with '80s rock. Many of the songs are about partying, which is obvious with titles like \\"Party Hard\\", \\"It's Time To Party\\" and \\"Party Til You Puke\\". Then there's the motivational \\"Got To Do It\\", as well as the best track, \\"Girls Own Love\\".<br />I really don't see why people aren't buying this album. Most of the songs on here get better the more you listen to them, especially \\"Girls Own Love\\" and the title track. The only flaw I can see is that \\"She's So Beautiful\\" is a little hard to get into. Still, this is a very good debut album...an album that will undoubtedly fulfill your need for speed.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I can only imagine that these reviews are for those who are not already converts to the show.  I am.<br />It's a tongue-in-cheek look at single life with a heavy emphasis on shoes (which works perfectly for me).  I LOVE the show though I worry about those who try to align their own personalities with those of the characters.  The characters are caricatures of personalities - lovable but quite nuts each in her own way.<br />The episodes are funny and fast.  This particular season is a great example of how a show can grow and the characters become personalities.  The early episodes are less cohesive than the later ones and the 4 stars are less involved in the stories as the show finds its format.  The clothes are cheap and if you're watching for fashion, the early shows will be disappointing - remember, this wasn't big budget when it started.<br />As a fan, it's a must own.  If you're just starting out, see it through to the end before making any judgments.  The series changed quite a bit as it grew into itself and the first few episodes are not representative.
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie's CD is one of the most soulful and passionate albums I have heard in a long time.  She is real when she sings and her voice is similar to no one else.  India's album is a must buy because she really moves you with her amazing lyrics and sound.  India ... you go girl keep doing your thing!
B000001FVL|5.0|Boy, oh boy, this one HELLUVA great album. Plain, pure, and simple. From the second the faint alarm clock rings in the beginning of \\"Living In The Plastic Age\\" to the dog barking in the distance at the very end of \\"Johnny On The Monorail\\", it feels like you've been transported into an alternate 1980-esque universe. Despite the brief 8 song length, they're all masterpieces. My favorite is definately the offbeat \\"Kid Dynamo\\", with its very different vocal track.<br />  In my opinion, the Buggles had the potential to be the Beatles of the '80s but it never happened, as Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn released one more album, which paled big-time compared to Plastic, then persued much more successful solo careers, with Asia and The Art Of Noise.<br />  The only complaints I have would be the lack of liner notes, and the sub-par sound quailty, which is thankfully amended by the new re-release, which also has three bonus songs!!  Whooo! The Buggles will always sadly one of those \\"forgotten but always remembered\\" bands.

0393316041|4.0|Usually auto biographies (altough this book is written by a friend, its contents are taken directly from the mouth of Dick Feynman) are apologetic and with the objective of gathering sympathy from the readers, right? wrong! Richard Feynman is a brave man, and is not afraid to show is weaknesses and failures alongside with is triumphs (sometimes those simple things that made him happy like learning how to play bongo or samba in brazil).<br />It's very interesting to discover that genius worry with the same things as we common mortals. Like how to get a date from a pretty lady (altough I don't agree with is way, but it worked for him...).<br />This is a very good book that makes interesting reading, buy it.
B00004RFCM|2.0|The popularity of this series eludes me.  If this is sex in NYC, I'll pass thank you. To me, Sarah Jessica Parker is the epitomy of thr pseudo sophisticated New Yorker.  She is about as captivating as a wet noodle.  This series makes \\"Red Shoes Diaries\\" look like hard core porn. <BR>I'll take Cinemax any day.
0380789019|5.0|Before he broke out full time into the world of novel writing Gaiman's reputation mostly rested on a relative handful number of comic books he had written, most notably (though not his best stuff) The Sandman series which showed his ability to toy with fantasy and myth to a near demented degree previously not expected for comic books.  At best it was flat out amazing, at worst it was merely pleasant.  Name recognition alone probably drove a lot of Gaiman starved Sandman fans to this book but fortunately it has much broader appeal as a contemporary fantasy.  In this tale normal guy Richard Mayhew helps a stranger and winds up falling through the cracks into &quot;London Below&quot; a quasi-mystical world that coexists and yet can't be seen by &quot;London Above&quot;.  Now Richard, with a bizarre cast of comrades has to help the lady Door figure out how killed her family and what it all means, while dodging all sorts of unpleasantness that keeps popping up.  The idea of a fantastic dark London overlapping the normal London isn't anything new (DC Comics' Hellblazer went over that concept all the time and &quot;Midnight Nation&quot; applies it to the entire US) but the key to a story like this is imagination which Gaiman has in spades.  Every texture of the London Below feels real, and almost every page has some bizarre occurance or some off kilter social commentary disguised as fantasy coming from all sides.  He has more good ideas than any man should possibly have and these ideas and his brilliant descriptions are what carry the novel, for the most part, you can read the whole thing like a travelogue and just become immersed in this strange and amazing world.  The plot doesn't hold up so well and at times requires some dubious leaps of logic to connect two points together and for some reason, even though the whole story is executed brilliantly, the emotional center feels a bit hollow, most of the characters are painted with broad strokes and while I was incredibly interested in their plights, I didn't really care as deeply as I should have.  Gaiman succeeds best when he's trying to darkly whimsical (most of the story), creepy (the scenes with Vandermar and Croup are sporadically effective, though the &quot;ruthless killers who talk like Oxford graduates&quot; has been done by everyone from Hannibal Lecter on down) or sentimental, which for the most part were the same problems with dogged the weaker Sandman stories.  But his boundless imagination carries everything even through the slower moments when it just seems like one of those useless fantasy &quot;Point A to Point B&quot; quests and the ending is absolutely pitch-perfect, even though you suspect it's coming, watching him pull it off is definitely watching a genius at work.  Gaiman fans will find this the greatest novel of all time of course (sorry, best fantasy novel is still &quot;Little, Big&quot;, folks) others not exposed to him will find this an absolutely pleasant and quick read that immerses them in a world that if not for the danger (and hey even then) most of us wouldn't mind living in.  Or at least visiting.terested in their plights, I didn't really care as deeply as I should have.

0800137884|1.0|I watched this movie with high expectation, partly because of the cast, partly because of the budget, but mostly because the director had indicated that he would stay true to Bram Stoker's book.  From the first scene, it is obvious that this was never his intention.  He attempted to turn the story into a romance - something that is quite far away from Stoker's novel.  Things go downhill from that point very quickly.  First of all, we find Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker.  Usually, I like Keanu, but here his is totally miscast and the delivery of his lines is painful.  Gary Oldman also makes a very poor Dracula.  For me, a telling early scene is the famous bit where Dracula refers to the wolves as Children of the Night and their howling as music.  Not only does Oldman deliver the line extremely poorly, but Reeves' tacked-on protest seems very out of character for a guest (and a very nervous one, at that).<br />By the time we get to London to find Lucy...in post-Victorian England and Dracula stalking Mina behind sunglasses, it was clear to me that the movie was hopeless.  I did see some very clever camera shots and there were some decent bits on board the ship, but it's not enough for me to give this anything more than the worst rating possible.  To be honest, I actually found the movie insulting - a very rare occurrence for me because I have very low standards.

B00005T30L|5.0|As an inhabitor of my own gohst world all through high school, I adore this film. It's take on being a teen girl is refreshing, original, and true. Unlike wierd girl movies of recent (\\"She's All That), Thora Birch's Enid is herself through to the end. She changes for no one and shows you her wonderfully original world along the way. Anyone who doesn't like this movie enjoyed High School way too much to be sane.
B000060P79|5.0|I was told by a friend a few months ago to check these guys out, and now I can't stop listening. They have an awesome sound, and very deep lyrics. If you've got the time to check them out, do it, and you won't be dissappointed.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Thought provoking and complex, this movie refreshed me after so many bad teen flicks. Donnie Darko not only scares you but he entrapes you in his world of bunnies and time travel. The acting is excellent, allowing you to find yourself in each character and making you become invested in everyones individual story. The fact that it did not win an oscar, shows that there is something deeply wrong with the film industry.
B00005T30L|2.0|I love the actors in this movie!  Ileana Douglas is a total goddess!!  Any role she plays is always done with such a passion; I am still scratching my head as to why she doesn't get roles that show what kind of talent that lady really has.  If you've seen the HBO series \\"Six Feet Under\\" I don't think there is anyone out there that has seen it that can honestly say they weren't moved or totally annoyed by her briefly displayed character in that series.  The irony is, her character \\"made\\" that series and provided something no other actress could have pulled off.  Well, Ileana does a little number in \\"Ghost World\\" too.  You can honestly look at her character and know there is not one actress in Hollywood that can pull off playing an overtly passionate art teacher like Ileana!  She's brilliant!  Unfortunately, this movie isn't!  It moves too slowly, has a dull plot, uses other extremely talented actors to play dumb-downed roles and fires jokes off at random without a punchline.  There are moments in \\"Ghost World\\" that are reminiscent of \\"Romi and Michelle's High School Reunion,\\" (a far better film that uses humor as a background and not as the focus of the story) which makes me think this film doesn't really have much originality.  Countless movies have been made using the Goth genre as the setting for much more engaging stories but this movie simply doesn't bring home the bacon.  As much as critics have hailed this movie, the only thing this proves is exactly how catatonic critics really are!
B000002MY3|5.0|I love this album because for once an artist has the balls to expose their inner thoughts in a intelligently defensive AND offensive manner. This Work is her best because it shows her naiveity and weakness and by doing that the album becomes a force, an epic tale of Jaded love, infidelity and the consequences the perpertrator has on its victim. Musically , Lyrically, and Vocally. Alanis Morrisette is a genius ahead of her time in my opinion, she is a master of the descriptive, and belts out curmudgeons with a forked tongue with venomous vengeance prevalent in one track where she sarcastically tells her ex lover what hes missing because shes now 'MIss fame' and all he is , is the end credits but she wont even mention his name because everyone knows it ( ... ) springs to mind.<BR>If only Alanis was as successful in the love department , if anyones ever listened to Chris Isaac then the'yve listened to Alanis'is soulmate. This is quality Manic depression with a heart in wire and humour on fire its the encyclopedia of her heart and when you've listened to her pour it out, you realize shes done the job for you and we're all the same pathetic, shallow, fragile and weak people.
B000005IS1|5.0|This is one of the most energetic rock albums ever made and is my favorite live album by any band.  They manage to infuse the same kind of energy that a gloriously sloppy band would into a live performance, but at the same time keep the playing tightly together enough so that it packs an enourmous, walloping punch.  It's almost as if they can't hold back their enthusiasm, excitement and energy.  The result is beautiful.  Even the final experimental track rocks.  This album easily holds its own against any hard rock band today.  Truthfully, it blows them all out of the water.  100% pure, powerful rock and roll!
6305428220|5.0|This movie is a great one and if you miss out, you are sure to regret it.  The Faculty has a twist of comedy and teen horror that makes it extremely suspensful.  Starring Clea DuVall, Josh Hartnett, and Elijah Wood, those actors make this movie both thrilling and hilarious.  I would recommend this movie to everyone from 12 to 60, for everyone is sure to enjoy The Faculty and want to see it again and again and again...
0679745203|5.0|\\"The English Patient\\" is, without a doubt, one of my very favorite books.  It is lush, beautiful and gorgeous.  And the glory of it is that it got that way with fine, first-rate writing.  You won't find any gimmicks or ... tricks here.<br />Unlike the movie, the book begins in war-torn Italy (1944) where we encounter Hana, a Canadian nurse and a horribly burned man known only as, \\"the English patient.\\"  Alone in an isolated, abandoned convent, Hana stays behind when her friends move on to care for the dying English patient.  Hana is a rare individual and truly caring.  She spends her days reading to the English patient from the volume of Herodotus that was found with him and, when his pain becomes too great, she injects him with morphine.<br />Hana and the English patient aren't alone long, however.  A mysterious man named Caravaggio soon arrives and it becomes clear that he has an agenda all his own.  Nevertheless, it is Caravaggio who succeeds with the English patient where others have failed.  This trio is soon joined by a Sikh named Kip, a man who will play a role in Hana's life, just as she will play a role in his.<br />Eventually, of course, we learn all about the English patient, who really isn't English at all, but a Hungarian count named, Almasy.  We learn where he's been and why and how he came to be so horribly burned.  We learn about the great love of his life, a love that sadly, was doomed from the very start.<br />This is a book that is told on two levels and contains two love stories.  One takes place in the past and the other takes place in the present.  While Hana's story is told in the present tense, it is not as involving or as intense as is the love story involving Almasy that takes place in the past.  I think this is because Hana and her lover are not as fully-realized as are Almasy and his lover, though Hana is by far the most sympathetic character in the book.<br />The character of Caravaggio is as mysterious as is the English patient.  We dolearn about him, however, and about his mysterious connection to Almasy.  The stories of Hana and Caravaggio are heartbreaking and heartbreakingly beautiful.<br />\\"The English Patient\\" is a quiet love story, one told without the necessity of melodrama or \\"fireworks.\\"  However, it is one that cuts deep, and one that any reader will remember long after the book is finished.  This is a story that simply rings with universal chords...of love, of loss, of sadness, of betrayal.<br />If I have one quibble with this book, it is with the denouement.  I didn't really want to know what happened to some of the characters in the distant future.  I wanted Ondaatje to leave a little for my imagination.  But he didn't and that's his choice.  It certainly didn't ruin the book for me.<br />The writing in \\"The English Patient\\" is lyrical and beautiful, though spare.  Ondaatje is first and foremost a poet, and it shows.  This is a book that flows, that cascades, that washes over you with its words.<br />I first read \\"The English Patient\\" years ago and I haven't forgotten a single detail.  \\"The English Patient\\" is a book that captures your heart and never lets go.  It is a book that will haunt you with its beauty and with its sadness for many years to come, perhaps even for the rest of your life.  Yes, it's that good.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Now that the Soviet Union has crumbled, and the United States reigns as the single golbal super power, one would assume that Dr. Strangelove would have become obsolete. Not so.<br />The world is still in the same sorry state that plagued us all at the heighth of the cold war. The actors may be different, but the story remains the same. And Dr. Stangelove told the story better than most. Strangelove examines the insanity of Mutual Assured Destruction, the never ending arms race, and the impact both had on the global community.<br />Anyway, the work of Peter Sellers is excellent. He was one of the most versatile actors of the time. Not only did he play the part of the dark Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove, but also bumbling Commander Mandrake as well as the President. George C. Scott played the hawkish General Buck Turgeson, and did convincing job of itching for war with the \\"Ruskies\\"<br />In conclusion, the movie turns a humorless topic in to a extremly fun dark comedy. Well worth watching.
B00005JKBC|3.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would; I really love action films, but the trailers just didn't grab me for this one. I'm also not especially fond of Robert Redford, but I did like him in &quot;Spy Game.&quot; This is a war-buddy film, and it's somewhat predictable; at one point relatively early on, Redford makes a statement about Never Ever Doing A Certain Thing, No Matter What, and No Matter For Whom, whereupon you immediately know that this will likely happen. Still, despite the blase cinematography and almost complete lack of color in the film (which I realize is of course deliberate,) I did enjoy it more than I thought I would.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is the best movie ever! I first saw it when I was eight years old and it scared the bejezzus out of me, but I saw it later and  enjoyed it so much. It has a great message that preaces against modern science and greedy corporations, especially the ones in the life sciences.<br />The Dinosaurs look almost life-like, and I commend the puppeteers on their excellent work. The acting is also really great. Joseph Mazzello, Jeff Goldblum, Laura Dern, and Sam Neill are all great in it.<br />This movie is great and if you haven't seen it, (Which I doubt you haven't,) go buy it and see it. This IS a great movie and I give it five stars.
B00003CXV4|2.0|I was marginally curious about this film when I saw the trailer, but definitely unwilling to pay to view it. Fortunately, it came on HBO while I was staying in a hotel, and I could watch for free. It was largely what I expected - fairly worthless. Keanu Reeves performed better than he historically has, but Charlize Theron was fairly flat. Though the premise was marginally  interesting, the plot is completely predictable. One bright spot was Jason Isaacs as Chaz/Cherry, who delivers his usual caliber of excellence. It did jerk the obligatory tear from me at the end, but that's largely because I'm easy that way. Four yawns and two stars.
B00005JKJA|5.0|As a movie reviewer for a newspaper, I get to see a lot of movies and review them, which is great because I have been a movie junkie since I was five. Every once in a blue moon, I see a movie that is on the level of 'Mulholland Drive', that level being simply astounding!<BR>I find that David Lynch, my favorite living director, can't go wrong. This story only proves my point. It is surreal dream that involves two women: a bright eyed Canadian dreamer(Naomi Watts) and an amnesiac who has just survived a car accident on Mulholland Dr.(Laura Harring). The sub plots include a young filmmaker(Justin Theroux) and a feeling that hangs over the whole film, fear.<BR>Watts, in her first lead role in an American film, is beyond brilliant and was more deserving of an Oscar nomination than Renee Zellweger. Harring and Theroux are equally excellent. Look out for Ann Miller in her first film role in almost forty five years.<BR>Low and behold, David Lynch's soon-to-be classic is the best film of 2001 by a mile. -James R, Louison
6305127646|4.0|While &quot;The Saint&quot; isn't precisely an epic film that everyone should see, but it's really fun and keeps my attention and interest each time I watch it. Val Kilmer displays his innate gift for accents and for a chameleon-like ability to change his personality traits. Elisabeth Shue, of whom I've never been fond, is also enjoyable in her role, largely due to her brimming and infectious enthusiasm for her work. This isn't a Must-See Movie, but it's sure to be enjoyable for anyone who likes action movies.
B000002UCQ|5.0|Since the original 1970 vinyl, 3 record set is not listed for review, I choose this, the original CD package. This towering, sprawling masterpiece is even more gorgeous in it's first version than the remastered, 30th anniversary edition. The dramatic, quietly moving cover photo (very Un-Beatle like) and the epic feel from production touches by Phil Spector lend this LP an atmosphere all it's own. \\"I'd Have You Anytime\\", \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", \\"If Not For You\\", \\"Behind That Locked Door\\" \\"Beware Of Darkness\\" are just a few of my favorite tracks on this LP. Somehow, these terrific songs were overlooked by The Beatles two chief songwriters and were luckily saved by Harrison until he could truly flourish and give them the breathing room they deserved. Not all artists grow and produce good work under such high expectations and the sweeping, orchestral sound of these proceedings would daunt even the most confindent singer, but George simply cast off all his insecurities and produced the most moving work of his life. As the first post-Beatles release, this did not dissapoint and it's still mighty impressive considering the huge body of work these gents produced, both as a band and as solo artists. Everything about \\"All Things....\\" is different and liberating, the long hair cascading down George's shoulders, the long beard, scruffy clothing and lonely, almost desolate looking cover photo showed that this was a man beginning a new path in life...alone. The song selections are also key, just check out some of the titles; \\"My Sweet Lord\\" (his delivery is raspy and impassioned and just brings tears to your eyes)\\"Isn't It A Pity\\", \\"The Art Of Dying\\", songs that no mop-top fan would have been keen to listen to a mere 5 years prior, and all written by the youngest Beatle, but clearly the most mature and deep thinking member of the band. The more I listen to this brilliant LP, the sadder it makes me. We lost a true giant last November 29, and I'm still reeling. \\"All Things Must Pass\\" while it won't let me forget, somehow offers me great comfort.ile it won't let me forget, somehow offers me great comfort.
B0000584V3|5.0|Opeth has done many things that have made a lasting impression on me. First they'll start out heavy, with the vocals just ripping away at you. Then they'll switch to acoustic guitars, and the vocals will change also to beautiful and dreamy. Then they'll switch back to hacking away at your mind! Pure genious!<br />One thing about this album is that they have an entire song that's all acoustic guitars and clean vocals. Harvest. It's my 2nd favorite song by them. My first is actually Face of Melinda, which is on their Still Life album. Harvest is a great song that you'll love even if you are a true Death Metal fan! But, just because it metal doesn't mean it can't be beautiful! Can it?<br />I highly recommend this album. To Opeth fans or non-fans. It'll really open your eyes. The lyrics are greatly done, the music is beautiful and will leave you waiting for more, and the vocals are by far the best!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|...the direction and art direction of this film alone was extraordinary, definitely a unique film.<br />My two favorite lines, and two of the most thought provoking:<br />Donnie to Frank:  \\"Why do wear that stupid bunny suit?\\"<BR>Frank to Donnie:  \\"Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?\\"<br />Certainly made me sit up and think!
0385335482|4.0|A friend loaned this to me and at first I was skeptical because I'm not much of a shopper myself. No matter. Becky is one of the most endearing book characters I've ever come across.  Kinsella has written her in such a way that you don't have to share her obsession to connect with her.  She could charm even the stiffest of bean counters with her desparate attempts to live the high life she can't really afford. <br />It took me a bit to adjust to the occasional use of British slang and to realize that a quid and a pound note are the same thing, but the closer I got to the end, the harder it is to put this book down. It really drew me in and I was sorry to see it end.<br />I can hardly say that this a classic tale that will last the test of time, but then every book doesn't have to be.  This is a fun, lighthearted book, that reads easy and rarely fails to make you laugh with (or in some cases at) the main character.  I'm looking forward to reading the follow-up.
0440178002|5.0|Epic?  Novel?  History?  Cultural Lesson?<BR>All of the above!<br />This is an incredible work on numerous levels.<br />On the surface, it's a historical fiction about the power struggles in Feudal Japan as the country comes to grips with Western influence.  Lord Toronaga is a fictional character based on Tokugawa, the 3rd major unifier of feudal Japan.<br />On a second level, the book sets the stage for Clavell's Asian Saga.  Seeds are planted here that appear throughout his novels.<br />On a third level, the book is a treasure of Japanese culture.  For those new to Japanese culture, the behaviors and interactions of the characters seems very foreign.  Even back then, how could civilized people think like that?  Guess what - they think like that now too!  And Blackthorne - the prototypical Gai-jin - he set the standard for foreigners struggling in that culture.<br />On a personal level, this is a book that grew with me.  It fueled an interest in Japanese culture and history.  In the years following my first pass of Shogun, I read quite a bit of Japanese history, and saw the accuracy of the story.  Later, when I lived in Japan, I found my understanding of the culture radically improved by the lessons learned in the book.  <br />And to think, I bought this because &quot;I need a thick book to pass time on all these plan rides!&quot;
B000050XEI|5.0|Lots of very smooth, relaxing music that's great to have on in the background no matter what you're doing. It's generally got an upbeat feel to it, though, so it's not at all depressing. I haven't decided if I like the original or remixed version of \\"Only Time\\" better. (note: that the remixed radio version is not on the CD). Both are excellent, just with a slightly different vibe. The remixed version is a bit jazzier. Either way, it's a pretty good representation of the rest of the CD. <br />I listen to it at work whenever I need to drown out my boss and focus on writing up a technical report of some kind. It's great if you need to zen out without being too distracted from what you need to get done.
B000000H40|5.0|Ok, I'm going to be honest, for years I avoided Obituary even if they were one of the many home-state Floridian Death Metal bands. I just avoided them completely, like the 12th plague from Egypt. I spent my time more closely to the likes of Morbid Angel, Death (RIP Chuck Schuldiner), Possessed and Malevolent Creation. I always thought this band was just another generic Death Metal band such as Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, and the very horrible Cancer. I would always look down at kids who whould glorify the later bands that I despised for giving Death Metal such a bad reputation. But whenever I heard that guitar tech-wizard James Murphy was on this album and ONLY on this album, I was skeptical. I went to my local record store and gave it a shot. Oh, how was I so foolish? Oh why did I pass this band up? The opening-groove downtuned guitars and slowed-down double bass beats to the song \\"Dying\\" had my brain hypnotized. I purchased it and was enthralled! I had it on total rotation in my CD player for the next several hours and it now finds a nice snug place in my CD collection. May be I had heard the less-interesting stuff like \\"World Demise\\" and \\"End Complete\\", but \\"Cause Of Death\\" did in fact make-up for those years of neglect. James Murphy's guitar riffs are nothing but pure passion on this album, not to forget Frank Watkin's and Donald Tardy's excelent musicianship. If you doubted this band as I have for so many years, you will doubt no more! Pick up \\"Cause Of Death\\" and enjoy! Best songs on here are \\"Dying\\", \\"Memories Remain\\" and the Celtic Frost cover \\"Circle Of The Tyrants\\".
B000059GEI|5.0|One of the great musicals of the 50`s. All star cast and great numbers. Ethel Merman at her finest singing the title song. Worth buying the DVD just for that. Marilyns Heatwave number makes the mercury jump to 93. Dan Dailey always one of my favorites overshadowed by Astaire and Kelly. Donald O Connors finest hour was of course Make Em Laugh from Singing In The Rain but this is close second.The lovely Mitzi Gaynor and of course a man sadly forgotten by some nowadays. The Prince of Wails himself. Johnny Ray proving that he was better that most pop singers who turn to acting.I remember seeing this at a young age in our local theatre and thinking it was great all these years later i still feel the same...The question now is when will Call Me Madam appear on DVD also starring Ethel and Donald. A treat indeed for anyone who enjoy`s a good musical.

0788812408|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was 10.  I had seen Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, but neither caught my attention.  Maybe it was my age, maybe my increased curiosity with water and mermaids.  I received my first video copy in high school, and I wore it out by my freshman year in college.  Shortly after another copy magically found it's way into my collection, which does not run very smoothly any more, but doesn't need to because I now have yet another copy.<br />Every time I see The Little Mermaid, I am recaptured by the innocence and curiosity of Ariel.  I identify with her, as I think most young girls do, and I find her attempts at achieving independence from her father familiar.<br />The animation was a giant step for Disney, the quality is much better than their past productions.  I think the movie gained an audience not only for the one film, but for a generation of &quot;Disney-philes.&quot;
B00003CXAA|3.0|First the good news...<br />I purchased the much-anticipated Godfather Box Set, knowing already what great movies these were (well, Part III is merely okay, but I'll spare the redundancies ...you've heard it all before!) The first two pictures continue to be towering achievements in epic film making. Coppola's treatise on family and the mob are undeniable classics.<br />Nearly as great an accomplishment is Al Pacino's performance in the first two films. If you only have knowledge of Pacino's later, over-the-top work (Scent of a Woman comes to mind), you will be amazed at the great subtleties he is capable of. He is mesmerizing to watch here. In fact, everything in Part's I and II is nearly flawless, from the the cinematography, Nino Rota's score, the period design, etc.<br />The bad news is all about the prodution of the DVD. Having both the VHS and Laser Disc versions of these movies, I was eagerly awaiting the DVD release. One of the main reasons I was in such a state of anticipation was due to the flaws apparent on those earlier formats. Both the tape and LD versions are rather dark, particularly the scenes in Vito Corleone's office and in Michael's boat house. Sadly, the DVD does nothing to help these scenes. In fact some are worse - for instance, when Jonnie Ola gives Michael an orange in Part II. Characters in these scenes are barely perceptible, fading into the shadows, only distinguishable by their voices.  <br />There is a very bizarre video problem with one scene in particular. Near the end of Part I, at Vito's funeral, Tessio (Abe Vigoda) comes up to speak with Michael. As Tessio's back fills the cameral with a dark shadow, the image of a red face is superimposed on the shot. I could not believe what I was seeing the first time I saw it. I've replayed this, and used the still pause, and it is there! I seriously doubt that this was intentional as it is rather disturbing.<br />My other complaint is about the sound on Part I. In spots, it is very echoey, sounding as if the film were shot in a cavernous sound stage. I can only guess that this problem cropped up during the remixing of the soundtrack for Dolby Digital. In any event, it is not apparent on either the VHS or LDs.<br />There are some nice extras on the fifth DVD, but overall I was a bit disappointed at how this package turned out.
B000002ITG|4.0|I put 4 stars because I feel that they just shouldve put this out as a double disc set and ditch the \\"interviews\\" disc. And [get rid of] the \\"Early Days\\" and \\"Latter Days\\" and there you have it. the perfect \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation of Zeppelin. Good selections too. My only complaint is they should've replaced \\"Dyer Maker\\" (which just sounds like pop to me) with \\"Over The Hills & Far Away\\".
0553212443|3.0|A Christmas Carol is a story of social conscious, where wrongs are righted and kindness prevails.  Set in a time much like today: where poverty is widespread, being of the middle class is popular and a small population holds a large potion of the wealth.  Social class dictates life, most lifetimes are spent in a single class and there is seldom movement within the classes.  The characters of Dickens novel live, and for the most part, thrive in this environment.  They trust in the Lord and their fellowman; during this Christmas season they are charitable and kind, with the exception of Ebenezer Scrooge.  He is a cold, heartless man with no compassion or sentiment.  He hates Christmas and refuses to give any portion of his wealth to the needy and less fortunate.  Scrooge is a cheap man, who doesnt trust banks, so he heats both his home and office with one small fire, keeps his money in a safe and counts it regularly.  It is the only pleasure he allows himself.  He is also a lonely man; his business partner, the closest thing he had to a friend, died seven years ago and he has disowned his one remaining relative.  <BR>    The life of his office clerk, Bob Cratchit, is entirely different.  Bob works from dawn until dusk for a poor fifteen shillings a week, and is only begrudgingly given Christmas Day off.  Despite this, Bob is a happy man.  He has a loving wife, six beautiful children and a warm, cozy home.  The Cratchits where not happy with their situation, but they were happy, grateful, pleased with one another and contented with the time.<BR>     The lives of Scrooge and the Cratchits are permanently interlocked after the three ghosts pay Scrooge a visit.  His journeys with them and the realizations he comes to, leave him a redeemed man.  He changes his behavior, vows to amend the wrongs he has done, but he is not a totally new man.  Although Scrooge donates his money to the less fortunate and spends his time with the Cratchits, his actions are purely to appease his conscience.  His motivation is to make himself to feel better and to prove that he has not lost all the decent qualities he has when he was younger.<BR>    Charles Dickens wrote this novel, his shortest, for the sole purpose of making money to support his family.  He had several wives and many children; he spent most of his life living like Bob Cratchit, barley making bills and struggling to get his work noticed.  A Christmas Carol was Dickens best selling novel, his intention was for his story to be popular, which it was, but he also added elements that would dig at the emotions of his peers.  His depiction of a poor family at Christmas has become a tradition for years, and every Christmas someone reads his story and gives something of themselves to help make Christmas a better holiday for others.
0195149017|4.0|Mention the name \\"Frankenstein\\" and the first image to pop into people's minds is one of a big, dumb, green guy with bolts coming out of the sides of his neck. Anyone reading Mary Shelley's Frankenstein for the first time may be surprised to learn that in the novel the creature is neither inarticulate nor ignorant. He is the product of a zealous doctor's quest to take life and death into his own hands. The creature is shunned by all mankind, including the one person who should feel some compassion or responsibility for him, his creator, Dr. Frankenstein. All the creature ever wants is to be accepted by society and to find companionship. With an intellect superior to that of the average human being, he learns to speak and read. It isn't until after he understands that he is doomed to a life of rejection that he seeks revenge, turning violent and murderous. The underlying question of the novel is, who is the real monster here, the formidable creature or the creator who abandoned him?<br />Through the creature's own words, we hear of his confused awakening and search for understanding. From the start he recognizes that his appearance is so horrifying as to repulse anyone who sees him. Fittingly, once he has taught himself how to speak and read, his first attempt at communication is with a blind man. When he realizes the futility of his search for a friend, he focuses his efforts on another objective - revenge upon the one who brought him into this cruel world. The creature sets out to make Frankenstein's life the same sort of hell as his own.<br />The scientist Frankenstein goes to great lengths to complete his experiment, realizing too late that there are consequences for interfering with the laws of nature. He brings to life a most unnatural beast, and flees in horror from the being he has created. Feeling no responsibility to comfort the creature in any way, he instead wishes to completely abandon it and forget that it even exits, leaving it to struggle single-handedly in a world where it does not belong. Is it any wonder that his creation becomes slightly incensed at his abandonment and seeks to create for Frankenstein a life equal to his own in misery and isolation?<br />Who deserves the label of \\"monster\\"? First-time readers of Shelley's novel may have a hard time accepting that the creature is not a purely evil or demonic being; contrary to popular belief, he does not just wake up and start strangling people. The creature in the novel has qualities we more easily identify with, such as the desire to be loved and accepted. On the other hand, Dr. Frankenstein's actions are questionable at times. Is the creature justified in his revenge? Or does Frankenstein get the bad end of the deal, his originally well-intentioned experiment gone sour? Either way, reading Mary W. Shelley's novel presents to us the viewpoint of a very different \\"monster\\" than we expect.dly in a world where it does not belong.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter lives in #4 Privet Drive under the stairs. He lives with his Aunt and Uncle and he's cousin.  After going to the zoo, Harry gets into trouble with Uncle Vernon and Vernon locks Harry in his room.  Soon after that, letters for Harry are arriving through the door, down the chimney and even in a pack of eggs (which is a deleted scence on Disc 2).   Soon, Harry learns he is in fact a wizard, and his parents were wizards.  He goes to Hogwarts to learn magic.  At Hogwarts, Harry meets some friends, and some enemies.  The Quidditch game is an impressive scence.  Hagrid keeps repeating \\"I shuldn't have told you that\\" whenever he gives away something important.  <BR>         Disc Two contains a tour of Hogwarts, explains the game of Quidditch, Interviews with the Moviemakers, classrooms, library, and other stuff.   To unlock the deleted scences on Disc 2, you have to get a wand from Diagon Alley first.  To get to Fluffy, go to the \\"Classrooms\\" menu. Everything is clickable in this menu.  Good luck.
B00004S6GL|5.0|This album owns me. The work is monumental. Figure 8 overflows with Elliott's effortless lyricism and throbbing, melodic urgency. Initially, I was turned off by what I thought was an overproduced sound (compared to either/or and Elliott Smith). After spending more time with the album, I'm now convinced that Figure 8 should be mentioned in the same breath as those earlier works. It stays with me even after days away from my hi-fi. . .
B00003CXXP|2.0|I gave this movie every chance I could.  I wanted to like it.  I heard bad stuff from friends.  I missed it in the theater.  I rented it tonight (on DVD).  As I watched the movie, I wanted to like it.  It had interesting concepts in it, and they were intersperesed between 2.5 hours.... a total of maybe 20 interesting minutes in this mess of a movie.  All casual and serious movier-goers beware.... Those who critically watch a movie will be insulted as well as those who casually (passively) watch a movie alike.  This is a movie with no emotion, no plot, no direction (sorry Spielberg), no satisfaction, and a horrrible ending.  Sorry, this was the worst of Speilberg, unless I missed a few worse (like &quot;Hook&quot;).  It had no focus, and while I enjoyed parts of it, and up until a point I liked the subject of the movie, it was a complete disapointment.  It takes a turn for a worst in the last half-hour.  Rent with extreme caution.  I rented it against every well-meaning friends reccommendation and ending up agreeing with them.... that never happens.  I gave this movie 2 stars for the few interesting concepts introduced and because the DVD is well-produced if you liked the movie (however, lacking in trailers and teasers).  I wrote this review, and I don't EVER write reviews, and if I did, they would be praise.... the reason I came here is to seriously warn against people wasting to 2.5 hours of their lives.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|After borrowing this DVD from a friend, I was compelled to review it for all you [amazon.com] customers. This is one creepy, un-nerving, hypnotic film.<br />The reason this movie does it for me for pure horror lies in the fact that there is nothing scarier than psychological horror.You can take all the Freddy Krueger's, Jason's, and Michael Meyer's and you know it's all BS. Take some normal person with mental instability, and you've got something that will keep you up all night.
B00005RYLE|2.0|My special edition (the last DVD release) may not be letterbox (which sucks) but it does have a clear, crisp picture. I rented this before buying, man am I glad it saved me the money. The transfer is THX mastered, which means it's been filtered through a computer. Well it didn't work. The film is dark, often blurry and hard on the eyes. Sure there's a couple of nifty documentries on this disk, but the cheesy cover? Really, a collectable? It's lame, seriously. If you want a 16:9 copy, look for the new version without the $20.00 cover.<br />But really, they need to do a restoration on this film and finally, finally give us a last (this is the 13th DVD version)version of this classic.<br />Don't but the lame cover, or the crappy transfer.
B0000029PC|5.0|I had the Sony Classical Kubelik's version on K7. I decided to compare the versions recommended by Grammophone, Penguin & NPR to decide which one I would buy on CD.<br />At my surprise, I found Kubelik's version bland compared to others.<br />To my ears, Gardiner is too much rushing the score and the orchestra with periodic instruments sounds too thin and bright. At first, I liked it but then realized I was not really engrossed as I like it. Not surprising, as contrary to many people, I do not really go for his archetyped systematic way of playing music esp. romantic music (IMHO).<br />Then Bernstein's is joyful, full of go but sometimes desarticulated (1st symphony), impressive though. <br />And finally, Szell's is the one that sings & swings to me even during quiet movements it still gives me the goosebumps. I feel drawn into the music. The only drawback is the sound quality, the sound can seem a little muffled compared to other versions.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Almost Famous is Cameron Crowe's third time writing and directing and after Jerry McGuire he has a lot to accomplish here.<br /><br />This mostly Autobiographical story follows you William, a fifteen year old as he tours with an up and coming 70's rock band for a dream shot at writing for Rolling Stone. After finding out his mother lied to him about his age because he skipped ahead to years in school and didn't understand at 12 why he hadn't hit puberty - because she has let him believe he was 14. Sounds preposterous, yes, but it happened. Much of what you see here really did in some for.<br /><br />Fictional band Stillwater stands in as a composite of several bands Crowe actually interviewed as a teenager. Lead by Billy Cruduptand Jason Lee (of every Kevin Smith film but Clerks) the band rises, falls and faces reality as William grows up, looses he virginity (to three girls, including Anna Paquin, I think Crowe embellished a bit here?)  and falls in love with the lead guitarist favorite groupie/mistress/girlfriend, a self proclaimed Bandaide played to the hilt by the too-cute-for words Kate Hudson.<br /><br />The theatrical cut suffered from being too-long without enough character development and humor, this Longer version is better because it adds all the little things that hold a long film together. Simply put, it makes more sense and is more involving with the extra info.<br /><br />This is a watch it two-or-three times film where you can really notice different plot and character points with repeated viewings. The Commentary with Crowe and Real-life-mom is nearly as entertaining as Francis McDormand's performance as her.<br /><br />A great movie that might have been an Oscar contender had this complete version been the theatrical release.

B00003CXTG|3.0|Okay there are some cool things about this movie, but the movie was just plain awful. It focused more on the love story than on the Pearl Harbor event that led the U.S. into World War II. I went to see this film in theatres, and I liked it to a point, but I thought that it was cheesy because they tried to make it oh-so-dramatic. Its even more dramatic than Titanic! I think they wanted to have a titanic wannabe like hit in the box office but it failed! They hired the wrong people to make this movie. I wouldn't reccomend it at all.
B00005JKJA|4.0|David Lynch has long been regarded as a movie master of the weird and metaphorical.  After all, who else would have a beautiful dead girl wrapped in plastic as the symbol of the popular cult TV series TWIN PEAKS???  MULHOLLAND DRIVE is a cinematic mystery in which a sexy femme fatale (Laura Elena Harring) and a smart blonde cutie (Naomi Watts) are thrown together in a bizarre series of events which involve memory-loss, Hollywood politics, sexual attraction, and the love/hate dynamic.  Throughout the entire 2 and a half hour running time, this flick commands your attention as motives and identities change.  This is NOT a film for those with short attention spans.  Both Watts and Harring are alluring and wonderful as the women trapped in the bizarre surroundings.  Ann Miller makes a solid appearance as Watts' landlady, while Lee Grant makes the most of her cameo as a rather spaced-out fortune teller.  Unfortunately, those looking for the full DVD experience will be disappointed with this disk.  Mr. Lynch has gone on record as not being warm to the concept of DVD features and this film reflects that.  While there are the usual cast/crew bios and theatrical trailer, there are absolutely NO chapter stops, which forces the viewer to fast-forward to find favorite moments in the film.  This is especially galling since this film demands repeated reviewing of various sections in order to better understand it.  As a result of this, this film does not get the 5-star rating that it would probably get.  However, if you enjoy the off-beat and weird, I  heartily recommend this flick.

B00003CXXJ|3.0|I thought Shrek was technically excellent.  The animation is well crafted.  Mike Meyer's and Cameron Diaz were fine but Eddie Murphy was a bit too slick and drew attention to himself so that I felt at times that I was listening to a Murphy stand-up routine rather than the donkey character.  The \\"bathroom\\" jokes & gross-out antics seem to be an integral part of today's Hollywood comedy.  Do we really need trash culture invading our animated features?<BR>Needless to say I'm disappointed, not so much at what Shrek is but at what it could have been.
B000002G7E|1.0|It's downright frightening to read what some people have written about     this thing. Great album? Uh, no. The Velvet's best? Certainly not. BEST ALBUM EVER?? You should seriously move out of your parent's basement and get your life straightened out. Sister Ray in particular; what a        steaming pile of dog doo that wretched thing is.  And I'm a big fan of Lou Reed's notorious Metal Machine Music!! While that album is not music, it certainly is a very intriguing concept. White Light White Heat however makes pretensions that this godawful noise is music, or at least I guess it does, who can tell? Stick with The Velvet Underground and Nico, the self-titles 1969 album, and Loaded. Try to track down a copy of the last album, Squeeze, as well. All are great-- seriously great-- albums. Then pick this up to complete your collection. Play it once and force yourself to sit through it just to say you've heard it. If you buy this garbage first you'll never want  to hear any more VU.  In my opinion. I don't begrudge  anyone liking or even loving this disaster, but for anyone to say it's one of the greatest albums ever is simply stupefying. Imagine Lydia Lunch circa '82 hooking up with a blind drunk '83 era Replacements. And then take away three fourths of whatever decent that   pairing from hell came up with, and you have White Light White Heat.

B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie Minogue has been an Australian sensation since the late eighties with that annoying electronica cover of \\"The Locomotion.\\" In the years that followed her debut \\"Enjoy Yourself,\\" Minogue won vast audiences in Australia (where she's the #2 native-born songstress), the U.K., France, Germany and several other places. Though she's tried several times to have a following in all the English-speaking countries, this is her first successful stab at the American market.<br />To win over the music officials here, however, her music has suffered miserably. She sings vaguely of love without the for erotic nature or intensely personal feeling expressed on prior albums, most notably Impossible Princess.<br />The overall feeling is the over-sythesized stuff she made famous on disco electronica album (and the most recent before this) Light Years. However, where Lightyears included spectacular lyrics, Fever seems to lack the incredible feeling. <br />Fever is not, however a weak effort- not at all! Minogue  wowed Americans with her perfectly catchy and nicely vocal-ized Can't Get You Out Of My Head. Personally, I don't care for the song that much. By Kylie's standards, it's very weak. A real listening pleasure would be the title track (\\"so tell me what do you prescribe for these syptoms: heart beating fast and work is a disaster\\") which incorporates her best writing skills, funky electronica with clever beyond belief lyrics.<br />In Your Eyes continues the trend with the dance melody to blow away all others, plus incorporates Minogue's prior album subtly (ohhh.. is the world still spinning around? [\\"Spinning Around\\" was a #1 hit in both the UK and Australia])<br />Another song that grabs my attention is \\"Dancefloor\\" (\\"gonna lose it in the music/got my body gonna use it\\") which has one of the most captivating beats. <br />Give It To me is a song with the beat to make an awesome disco song, but sadly is so pop-infused it's not as enjoyable as the rest.<br />More, More, More, LoveAt First Sight and Love Affair are nice tie-ins, all include good lyrics with a substantial melody.<br />The softest of the tracks (and one of my very favorites on the album) is Fragile, it's beautiful and would remind one of Madonna's Ray of Light- a little electronica with softly spoken vocals.<br />The album continues to prove Minogue's brilliance, but like the boring cover art, it proves she's watering things down to fit into the market here.
B000002W4V|5.0|Rock N Roll Animal carries such great memories from college, when it was always the record of choice at those small to medium-sized parties in the \\"living room\\" at the top of the spiral staircase of the dorm in which I was the RA during my senior year.  Everyone couldn't wait for the opening to \\"Sweet Jane.\\"  I did not know who The Velvet Underground were at the time, but learned from this album.<br />\\"White Light/White Heat\\" is a good live cut, with great guitar soloing, and \\"Lady Day,\\" with its banging rhythms, is an excellent inclusion, fitting in well with the electronically intense atmosphere.  But to me, Rock N Roll Animal will always be mainly three things:<br />1) The dynamic, double guitar electronic entry into \\"Sweet Jane\\" by Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner and then the swaggering remainder, making you temporarily forget heavenly wine and roses.<br />2) Those rushes of ecstasy in the absorbing \\"Heroin,\\" climaxed by the awesome finale, with the most dazzling, blistering, electrifying pieces of raw lead and rhythm guitar power I have ever heard.  The organ provides texture in the slower parts, and speeds up, in the faster ones, and oh boy, in that final rush....  If there is a better live version, someone please tell me.<br />3)  Hearing such a tremendous performance of the Velvet's best song ever, \\"Rock & Roll.\\"  In comparing it to the not-quite-so-intense studio version, I guess I look at the glass half full not half empty.  Is that second part in \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" by The Who understated in the studio, or a concert opportunity?  I like the studio \\"Rock & Roll\\" a lot, but this live version is something else, with an authentic rhythm guitar solo, fret-crushing and funky, along with the usual awesome lead, and this song is most about driving rhythmic pleasure, as much as you'll ever experience.<br />In the many displays of super-speeded guitar power, we are taken beyond explosion, to screeching, literally white light and white heat.  There is nothing like it.This is one of my top ten albums of all time.  It is the supreme display of Lou Reed's live talents.  A must.
B00005JKJA|4.0|First off, right or wrong David Lynch considers himself an aritst and has made some very specific requests about the release of some of his films on DVD (Straight Story, Fire Walk with Me, and Mulholland Drive): basically to let the films speak for themselves.  In Honoring this request, the DVD producers have left off much supplemental material than consumers have goten used to, and briefly censored one shot (Again directly at Lynch's Request).  This DVD as released BEST represents the vision of the director in releasing it in this medium.<br />As to whether or not the film makes sense, It Does.  Once the film is over there is a clear narrative line that informs every moment of the film and brings all the chaos into sharp focus.  What is it well that is for the viewer to figure out, Art has ALWAYS been about the viewer.  Is what finally turns out to be the story worth what David has done here?  yes and no.  Of David's surreal films (Eraserhead, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive) this is the simplest and in many ways least interesting, with reality bending in relatively few ways.  Of his accessable films (Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Straight Story) this ranks as the least involving.  Soo what do we have here?  A mixed attempt to bridge the gap perhaps.  In many respects the film is a mutant, it started as a TV project and evolved into a film in post production, it is largely told in a linear straightforward fashion, only really pulling lynchisms in the final act.  While explicit sexuality is shown, it is in many respects the most \\"normal\\" sort of any in his films while simultaneously being, in the \\"real\\" world very fetishized and poorly understood.<br />The film likely has legs in that it will probably be better appreciated in time, much like Fire Walk With Me has gained appreciation with the passage of time, but the fact remains that while the film is a good one and succeeds at most of what it is trying to attempt, if only in retrospect, it shares, with lost highway, a tendency to be modest in its ambitions.  Eraserhead, Elephant Man, Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, Fire Walk With Me, and Straight Story all had some significant and deeply felt things to say about the human condition and said them with a force not usually felt in Hollywood.  Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive have some things to say about Lynch's LA and share some ideas about the craft of narrative and film, and similar dream physics, but there the impact of the film largely ends.  The kinds of depth in mindscape that Lynch wants to play with here, and is trying to develop with his surrealist lens, is akin to Cronenberg's but for now lacks Cronenberg's precision, and scope.  In short while the potential exists for Lynch's surreal films to ultimately be mindshatteing and world changing, right now they are merely important artistic constructs.<br />The film IS a good one and David is doing a great job, but what this film is hinting at and is promising to eventually deliver makes this effort seem thin and pale, like Motzart composing a TV commercial jingle, yeah the genius and skill and brilliance is there, but what they really should be working on is the epic concerto and opera.ost highway, a tendency to be modest in its ambitions.

B000002IST|4.0|Since the 1970's, Genesis came a long way from a British cult band, to one of the most explosive rock acts of all time. But for Phil Collins, the dance finally broke away.<br />The 1991 album We Can't Dance, was the cornerstone of an era for Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and Mike Rutherford. The songs of We Can't Dance are simple and strong, with a little mix of experimental music aside. Songs like Hold On My Heart, Jesus He Knows Me, and No Son Of Mine, still pack a punch within the band in whole.<br />Although We Can't Dance remains as the final studio album of Genesis, with Phil Collins, the album is still as dynamic and ridged as you could predict from the Land Of Confusion. While many people still wrote off Genesis after Phil's departure, the music will remain the same.
0385503954|5.0|In a time when we are blessed with a wealth of gifted writers, even though we still mourn the passing of the likes of WG Sebald, it is still a wonder to encounter a work of the magnitude of Ian McEwan's current masterwork ATONEMENT.  Aside from he fact that McEwan has been consistently placing his fine, terse novels such as AMSTERDAM and ENDURING LOVE before us, there is little to prepare us for the grandeur of his magnum opus ATONEMENT.  We have grown to expect this author's mastery of the English language, his uncanny sense of timing in creating stories that push forward fresh tales with the speed of a locomotive while finding beauty everywhere in the nature that he sees like few others.  But nothing has prepared us for this masterwork.<br /><br />The story of ATONEMENT is well told by others commenting at this website.  What makes this illuminating novel so momentous is the crux of a story at once seeming so simple but ending as an indelible landmark in contemporary writing.  This is a contemplation of morality, of love, of the unspeakable disaster of war, of the indefatigable resources of the human soul, of the staggering implications of a lie from the lips of a child of what ever age, and of mortality, of love.<br /><br />If the first chapters of this book feel slow, making the reader ask why are we detailing every move of what appears to be another languid, hot summer day in a 1935 English household, we are slowly discovering this is a well paced prelude to the brassy blast that WWII  exploded throughout the world.  A family gathering becomes a microcosm for exploring the thoughtless poisons that produce devastating wars.  Once the tale begins to unravel there is no turning back on the series of events that continue to surprise and amaze us and maintain a tension so great that only the interludes of McEwan's matchless descriptions of nature provide breathing room.<br /><br />The author creates characters so adroitly painted that they are destined to become enduring literary names to reference when describing archetypes like Stephen Daedelus, Holden Caulfield, etc.  His ability to draw us into the war plains of Dunkirk, the hospitals of war-torn England, the mossy lawns of English gentry is matched only by his ingenious ability to go back and forth from character to character, from chapter to chapter, showing all the retracings of thoughts and deeds as seen by his various characters.<br /><br />While reading this magical book I was tempted to remember phrases to use while reviewing, phrases that were such beautiful examples of how fine a wordsmith McEwan is, but that endeavor was quashed when I realized that such phrases and word pictures of drama and still lifes were on all 351 pages of this opus.  To try to entice raders by such quotations would be robbing them of the joy of discovery when this book falls hopefully in the hands of everyone who loves literature, who needs nourishment of the sould, who cherishes fine writing.  To say more would be unfair.  Read with welcome.

0140544518|4.0|Think back.  Way, way back.  When you were a kid, didn't you think there was something wrong with a lot of fairy tales?  What right did Jack have to take the giant's possessions?  If the way was so perilous, why did Little Red Riding Hood's mother send her to grandma's house alone?  And why do stepmothers and wolves get such a bad rap?  Well, the truth as they say, will out.  And A. Wolf has decided to tell what *really* happened between him and the three little pigs.  It was all a misunderstanding, and you can read all about it in that flagship newspaper The Daily Wolf.<br />Author Jon Scieszka has written a funny version of the famous tale that will entertain as it helps kids see another point of view and evaluate differing tales.
B00003CXTG|2.0|\\"Pearl Harbor\\" could have been a great Best Picture contender.  When watching this film, it is painfully obvious that the makers of this film were using James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" as a guide.  They should have paid more attention to their own production.  This love triangle simply belongs elsewhere.  Every good critic knows that it is what made \\"Titanic\\" an outstanding emotional picture.  World War 2 and romance simply do not mix.  The attack scene is undeniably spectacular, despite the fact that it becomes tiresome as it progresses.  If only Michael Bay could have used Spielberg's \\"Private Ryan\\" technique, I could be giving this film 5 stars.
B00005N5S5|5.0|With the possible exception of Linda Hamilton's hair, this movie has aged well, and stands up under scrutiny today -- a remarkable achievement. Part thriller, part romance, part time travel paradox, The Terminator was a blast when it first came out and is just as much fun to watch now.<br />This DVD edition is terrific. You can listen or watch subtitles in English, French or Spanish. Special features include: trailers -- two from television, two for US theaters and one for foreign theaters; two documentaries -- an 18 minute retrospective with James Cameron (JC) and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the new one-hour &#34;Other Voices&#34; featuring cast and crew recollections; 5 deleted scenes and 2 deleted arcs, with JC commentary; a treatment, the fourth draft and the final draft of the script; and a photo gallery of JC's artwork, production stills, Stan Winston effects, special effects, and publicity materials.  There is a lot to see here and it is all interesting.<br /><br />There are some fascinating revelations here -- for instance, originally conceiving of The Terminator as an everyman who could be inconspicuous anywhere, Arnold was originally interviewed for the part of Kyle Reese and OJ Simpson was being considered for The Terminator!  Yikes.<br /><br />Lovely package.<br /><br />Note to Macintosh users:  Normally I would grade down for having material that is inaccessible to Mac users, but those items are made available here as html files -- if not an entirely satisfactory solution, at least an effort was made.
B000002IST|5.0|Message to James Swift: what planet were you on when you played this excellent album? Little of the freshness & exuberance of \\"Invisible Touch\\"? Flabby arrangements & lyrics? Get outta here! Having said that....1991's \\"We Can't Dance\\" is considered by many to be the last *real* Genesis album, as it's the last one with Phil Collins onboard (Tony Banks & Mike Rutherford DID carry on without Phil for one album, 1997's widely-ignored \\"Calling All Stations,\\" now on it's way to cut-out bins everywhere, sadly). Not surprisingly, \\"We Can't Dance\\" was also the last commercially-successful album the band would release, hitting the shops just in the nick of time as Nirvana's landmark album, \\"Nevermind,\\" was starting to change the face of rock in general, giving Genesis one last batch of hit singles & one last successful stadium tour just before their time in the sun ran out. \\"We Can't Dance\\" is a remarkable album---song for song, it is a stunning piece of work. With new producer Nick Davis replacing Hugh Padgham, Tony, Mike, and Phil eased off on the squeaky-clean, polished production of \\"Invisible Touch,\\" and bring to this material a much more down-to-earth feel. The result is a Genesis album that's still radio-friendly, and yet, still has some nice touches of the band's early days throughout (certainly on the longer songs), and also has a great maturity and sensibility to it. Not that I don't like \\"Invisible Touch,\\" because I DO, but after taking a four-year break following the tour for that hugely-successful album, Genesis, with new vitality, reconvened to make an album that walked the line between artistic vision & commercialism a bit better than it's predecessor. It's definitely an improvement.The songs are all first-rate and honest, with Tony, Mike, and Phil playing the material beautifully & expertly as only Genesis can, and with Phil once again delivering a vast array of excellent lead vocals (and thankfully, Phil is back to playing REAL drums again, instead of the synth-drum kit he used for most of \\"Invisible Touch\\"). Material ranges from child abuse (\\"No Son Of Mine\\") to the hardships of British railway workers (\\"Driving The Last Spike\\") to the tremendous guilt of a hit-and-run driver (\\"Dreaming While You Sleep\\"). \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" is a spot-on look at phony TV evangelists, and \\"I Can't Dance\\" is a groovy, hilarious poke at models in jeans commercials. \\"Tell Me Why\\" & \\"Way Of The World\\" are both excellent commentaries on the state of the world, and \\"Since I Lost You\\" is a gorgeous, heartfelt number about losing someone, inspired by the tragic death of Eric Clapton's young son. The rest of the tunes, including the beautiful love song \\"Hold On My Heart,\\" and the grand album-closing epic, \\"Fading Lights,\\" including a fiery jam workout in the middle, are all equally powerful.After the disappointing reception of the follow-up album, \\"Calling All Stations,\\" things have gone quiet in the Genesis camp. No, the band have NOT broken up as some have reported, they simply have no plans to do anything for the near future. I'll tell you something, though: even if Genesis never come back again, I take great comfort in the fact that these guys have had a great, GREAT run. So the last album didn't sell well---so what? Fifteen studio albums, five live albums, two box sets and a Greatest Hits album---that's a great catalog of work for a great band like Genesis to have, and a great catalog of albums for us, the fans, to enjoy. \\"We Can't Dance\\" is a marvelous reminder to me of a time when these guys were on top of the music world. It may represent the band's last real commercial triumph, but oh, what great memories. It's a fabulous, joyous album from my favorite band of all-time. :-)
0783229011|4.0|This is the story about Farmer Hoggett's pig Babe.  Farmer Hoggett wins Babe at the fair.  Since he was not a pig farmer, he did not think too much of this creature other than the possibility of a good Christmas dinner.<br />Since Babe was the runt of the litter, he was not ready to eat by Christmas.  This was a good thing since Babe had skills like no other pig.  It was discovered that Babe was able to do all the work generally assigned to a sheepdog!<br />To the outside world, Farmer Hoggett looked like a nice man who had mental problems.  Despite what people thought, he did not care.  He just went on doing his own thing his own way.  In the end his pig, Babe, won the sheepdog finals.<br />While it is obviously not a true or even likely story, it is quite humorous and very entertaining.  I would recommend this move if you are in need of a good laugh!  It is fun for the whole family!

B00001QEE6|5.0|This is one of the Disney Studios finest efforts. This film was something of a stretch for the studio, as the story was set in a more modern time period. As you know, they needn't have worried. This has proven to be one of the more enduring classics they produced, and it's so very easy to see why. The story is simple, yet effective. Lady is the family pet of a victorian-era husband and wife, who has to deal with the addition of a new baby into her home. As this unfolds, she encounters the Tramp, a mutt from the wrong side of the tracks, and they begin a courtship.Lady's owners take a small vacation, and an aunt watches over the household, bringing with her two siamese cats, and a lot of problems, for Lady. After escaping the house and the mis-understanding aunt for a while, Lady is caught by a dog-catcher and spends time behind bars in the pound. At this point we're presented one of Disney's best songs, He's A Tramp, sung by Peggy Lee. Now, I really don't want to go into detail after this, because I hate to give a movie's ending and twists away. I think one should experience the film's story oneself, and enjoy it as it unfolds. Sorry, but I'll go no further than this in the plot run-down, but really, this film has it all: wonderful songs, wonderful voice-acting, and fantastic animation work from the magicians at Disney. The film transfer to DVD is wonderful, with clear, clean sound coming from all speakers in my sound system. Get this film and enjoy a little slice of Disney heaven!
B000002H33|5.0|When I Fist Bought this album, I was trilled by the fantastic music work of Metallica. This is a must for all Metal and Rock fans. Hammett do some great work on his 6-string and good old Cliff is my favorite on this track beside Hammett. His excelent bass work is enormous... I would just say, go buy this album and have the time of your life...
B00000IL1K|5.0|To me, this CD marked the beginning of the classical crossover establishment in her career.  This is by far my favorite CD by her, and one I reccomend to my friends when they hear her, I personally think it's better than LaLuna-but not by a huge margin, lol.  Laluna has more classical pieces, where Eden has more of a simplistic pop feel.  Even Nella Fantasia, based on Gabriel's Oboe, is just simple and beautiful.  There is Nessun Dorma-short and sweet.  There is a delightful and sweet duet with Richard Marx, who also wrote the song.  She does the Titanic song in Italian-not one of my personal fav's but whatever..then there is DUst in the Wind, Deliver Me, Eden, So Many Things, An Ocean Away-all in English and popish and gentle.  The Italian pieces here aren't meant to be \\"classical\\" but more for gentle relaxation-this is a contrast from Laluna where the classical pieces are bigger.  Tu, Boliero are just vocal soaring and exquisite. If you need a CD for romance, that is subtle (that's hard to find now-a-days) this is it.  I've snuck it in the player when I'd have a date over, and ALL of them got hooked on her and asked about it.  It has broad appeal-male and female, and unlike Celine, Whitney and others-she doesn't honk her way through track after track-this is what allows the softness to settle in.
0195073401|5.0|One of my fellow reviewers, Mr. Al Snow, makes the following point:<br />\\"What you will learn is that economics is a junk science. Take one of 'fundemental assumptions' of microeconomics theory: preferences are complete. Completes means that a person knows the satisfaction s/he receives from every single bundle of goods available and will be available in the future. Introspection quickly reveals that this assumption is false, nobody has such knowledge of the world around them. In a real science a hypothesis/assumption that is proved to be false is discarded.\\"<br />The answer to Mr. Snow is as follows: the philosophy of logical positivism states that a theory should be judged by the accuracy of its predictions and not by the accuracy of its assumptions.  In other words, even if a theory makes wrong assumptions yet predicts well (perhaps because those assumptions, although wrong, are irrelevant to the result) that theory is useful.<br />This philosophy is, in fact, not just used in economics as Mr. Snow seems to think, but right throughout both the physical and social sciences.  See, for example, John Horgan's (1997) \\"The End of Science\\".<br />This is not meant to be disparaging to Mr. Snow.  In fact, he seems to display the desire for critical thinking which economics, and academic work in general, has always needed. May I humbly suggest he reconsider his disillusionment with economics?<br />If searching for further inspiration, one should remember that it took approximately 180 years since Adam Smith (\\"The Wealth of Nations\\",1776) first stated a version of the First Welfare Theorem (loosely paraphrasing - that individual selfishness can lead to collective good), for this to be proved axiomatically.  Without the systematic thinking, and use of assumptions, displayed in MasColell et al this would still today not have occurred and Smith's conclusion would still be a mere conjecture.<br />As for this book, it is the most complete collection of microeconomic theory everput together.  A solutions manual exists, too, put together by Chiaki Hara, Ilya Segal and Steve Tadelis.  The mathematics assumed is differential calculus and set theory, which virtually any undergraduate mathematics course either takes as a prerequisite or teached in its first year.<br />Anyone who wants to understand both the character and substance of the advances made in microeconomics over the last 50 years is strongly advised to read this book.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Think Michael Franks, but more \\"poppy.\\"  Think Dave Matthews, but not trying so hard.  Think Seal, but not as deep or ethereal.  Listen, this is just great music.  No big deal, not gonna change your life.  But it will make you beam from ear to ear with every listen.  The musicianship is top-notch and the recording is pristine.  My only beef with the recording is that it's a little bright, but the warm, accurate, and \\"live\\" bass and midrange are wonderful.<BR>This is fun music.  You probably won't sit and listen critically like you might a great jazz or classical disc, but you'll find it being left in your player more days at a time than you ever imagined.  And if you play it at a party, (which it is perfect for), there will be an ever-forming line directly to you of people asking, \\"Hey, who is this... this is so great!!\\"
B00005LMBK|4.0|There doesn't seem to be an over-arching pattern on Gorillaz' debut album.  Instead, based strongly on bass and a mixture of guitars, percussion and special effects, this forms an interesting sequence of musical vignettes.<br />There are 17 tracks in all, ranging markedly in length from 1:36 minutes to 10:01 minutes.  Musical styles (superimposed upon the basic structure described above) are also delightfully varied - from 60's psychadelia to British 60s guitar music to 80s' U.S. New Wave to hip-hop to jazz to Latin American crooning.<br />Very good background music, and well worth buying.<br />Oh, and one extra star for reviving the 1960s' idea (last used by the Beatles?) of the animated adventures of a band.  Good to see.
B0000639FE|5.0|Cameron Crowe is simply one of the greatest filmmakers ever and the great thing is that he isn't done doing it and I'm so honored to be around during his reign. Jerry Maguire touched me from the first time I watched this remarkable story. I even recently came across an old diary/letter I had written to myself. It refers to how I felt at a point in my life like the character Jerry Maguire when he is singing Free Fallin'. I quote myself saying \\"I was singing out Free Fallin' I felt like Jerry Maguire.\\" I was 16 then, I am a 21 year old aspiring filmmaker now and still watch Jerry Maguire and understand this character. All of these characters I learned to understand. The great thing about Cameron Crowe is that when he writes, he writes from his heart. Not to make money. He explains in the first Almost Famous DVD that he loves to write about the little things that are huge things in a normal persons life. When Ray hugs and kisses Jerry for the first time and how Dorothy is so overwhelmed and touched. Crowe tells that at that point he felt like a real Director. If you haven't read the Jerry Maguire book either buy it or go to the library or book store and read the intro by Cameron. You learn so much more behind this film and you appreciate it so much more. If you love Crowes taste of music in his films I highly recommend that you find on the internet these songs from Jerry Maguire that are not on the soundtrack: Sitting Still Moving Still Staring Outlooking by His Name Is Alive, Requiem Again by Durutti Column and Through The Hill by Andy Partridge and Harold Budd. If you feel as passionate about filmmaking as I do and love Cameron Crowe these songs will ignite that excitement and amazing feeling you get from watching a film that truly touches you. I don't want to get into a lot of detail as far as the story of the film because everybody likes something different but I do recommend you give this film a chance if you haven't seen it already. I also hope that it touches you like it has me.
B000002WU9|4.0|Altough this album to me is not a classic, it is a superior album<BR>compared to other Wu-Tang solo albums. Why? This this album was well produced and there were lots of artists featured on this album. In Cuban Link, Raekwon has the support of his righthand man Ghostface Killah. He also raps about 13 tracks of the album and co-produced it. The production by the RZA was probably his best work in his career. Not only Ghostface appears in this album, there are guest appearances by Method Man, Inspectah Deck,<BR>Nas, Cappadonna, and Golden Arms- just to name a few. Although I would'nt consider myself a Wu-Tang fan, this album is good and I would tell my people to buy this album.

It's one of those discs you put on and listen to the whole thing. Every song is great! I also must say that I've played this CD at work and turned alot of my co-workers on to it. It's rock, pop, and regge all rolled into one hella good masterpiece!
0440234743|5.0|This book proves the excellence of Grisham's talent.  He makes the most amazing plot that you will ever read.  He also captivates you throughout the book with twists and turns.  This is one of the many books that everybody would have to read that Grisham has written.<BR>     The first chapter was one of the most exciting introduction to a book that I have ever read.  After reading the first two pages of the book, I was thinking that it would turn out in a different way.  Was I ever wrong about my expectaions?  It gave a new twist to the story for me.<BR>     I also enjoyed that this was not just another courtroom and legal book that Grisham has previously written.  It showed me that Grisham could still think of different ways to keep his readers on their toes.  Once you think that you know how he is going to write the book, he goes another way.  To me, that is what made this book so exciting.  I wasn't expecting the way that he wrote it.<BR>     There was really nothing that I disliked about the book.  It was a book that I had to keep reading everyday.  There was not the usual stopping for a couple  of days, then picking it back up and starting again.  It was one that I was constantly wondering, what is going to happen next.
B0000634EV|5.0|Down's debut album, 1995's \\"NOLA\\" was a true masterpiece that took seven years to follow up.  Now Phil Anselmo (Pantera), Pepper Keenan (C.O.C.), Jimmy Bower (C.O.C. and Eyehategod), Kirk Windstein (Crowbar), and Rex Brown (Pantera, replacing Todd Strange) return with Down's highly anticipated sophmore effort.  First off, if you've listened to \\"NOLA\\" countless times like I have, you'll realize that the new album isn't as good but has a different vibe to it, and that is a rather good thing.  I love \\"A Bustle in Your Hedgerow\\", everything about it is so great.  As on the first album, Phil sounds a lot different, you hear that he can actually sing instead of the screaming he's famous for in Pantera, and Rex is one of the best bassists around today, and he shines on \\"Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But...\\" as does Jimmy Bower on \\"Lysergik Funeral Procession\\", and Pepper Keenan and Kirk Windstein are a great guitar combination.  Phil's wife Stephanie Opal lends some her vocal talents to album closer \\"Landing on the Mountains of Meggido\\" which sends the album off with a bang (check out her band Southern Isolation which even has Phil on guitar).  Other standout tracks include the southern fried \\"Stained Glass Cross\\", \\"Ghosts Along the Mississippi\\", \\"Learn From This Mistake\\", \\"Beautifully Depressed\\", and \\"The Seed\\".  If you are a fan of Pantera or Corrosion of Conformity and have never had the chance to listen to the first Down album, I suggest picking up both Down albums for a fine real hard rock/heavy metal experience.  I can't wait to see them on OzzFest, they're the only reason I'm going in the first place.
6303159966|1.0|\\"Cujo\\" is such a poorly-made horror flick that isn't even really a horror film at all. It's more of a family melodrama turned bloodfest. In the first half, there's no humor or personality in the characters at all, so when the last half begins you start rooting for the dog to kill the annoying son and neurotic mother. Which brings me to the acting. This movie has got maybe the most annoying kid ever in a horror film, Tad Trenton. Even when the dog attacks don't occur, he whines like a baby. Such poor acting, huh! I was kinda waiting for Michael Myers to come knive him to death. He was THAT bad! He was not likable, humorous, or real; just a whiny baby that his mommy should have spanked HARD! I've never been so hard on a child character in a movie, but Tad in this movie deserved to get his comeuppence, which unfortunately, he didn't. When it comes to a scary movie, this one just let me down and wasn't scary at all.
B000000OUE|5.0|I still listen to this regularly even though I got it six years ago.  White Zombie's \\"Astro Creep 2000\\" was a brand of industrial metal that turned the heavy metal world on its ear.  Before Rob Zombie became the self-indulged egotistical (but still cool somewhat) solo artist he is today, he led the great White Zombie with his trademark growling and funky lyrics (along with his always great album artwork).  \\"Astro Creep 2000\\" is an album with catchy heavy metal songs you can't help but bang your head to.  \\"Supercharger Heaven\\", \\"I Zombie\\", \\"More Human Than Human\\", and \\"El Phantasmo & The Chicken Run Blast 'O Rama\\" remain fan favorites and White Zombie classics, and this is one of the albums that you have no excuse not to have.

B00005J6UR|4.0|Just because something is old, that doesn't make it bad.  This movie is a great example.  It tells the story of Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend Kate, who is extremely hot, and their pet gremlin Gizmo.  But Giz is a friendly, mammal gremlin who is very nice.  The boy who sold Billy's father Gizmo gave him three rules to follow.  One was to avoid sunlight with him because it could kill him.  The next one was not to get him wet, and the final was to never EVER feed him after midnight, but he didn't explain why.  When he accidentally gets wet though, he spawns others like him, except they are very mischievious.  They later then trick Billy into giving them food after midnight, and they metamorph into reptilian gremlins with large teeth and claws, and the runamok through the suburban town.  This movie is a great blend of comedy and horror and the gremlins' antics are great, especially the scene in the bar.  However, this movie contains a lot of blood and gore, so if you get queasy easily, avoid this movie, or just turn your eyes away.
B00000K19E|5.0|Best movie ever great special effects amazing plot and everyone played there part and did a great job i am suspecting good things from moss and fishbone did an amazing job i cant wait for the sequel. dont listen to the people that gave it a bad review i pity those who did not like it <br /> SEE THIS MOVIE DONT RENT BUY I HAVE SEEN IT 78 TIMES
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This was a good movie, and I'm a teenager.  The jokes are funny on a few different levels, which makes them even better.  The animation is wonderful and the music is great too.  The plot follows Shrek the ogre trying to rescue a princess so that he can get the deed to his swamp back.  Along the way, he meets Donkey, a talking donkey who he becomes friends with, and he falls in love with Princess Fioana.  The only bad part about this movie was the bathroom humor.  I really think they could have done without it.
B00000F169|4.0|This is one of my favorite sci-fi movies, a hilarious send-up of space epics.  Director John Carpenter and co-writer Dan O'Bannon steer away from traditional sci-fi action to focus on the tedium and isolation of deep-space travel.  It's a risky concept, but it works.  Bleak comedy abounds as the crew of the ship _Dark Star_ slowly lose their grip on reality (although it's clear that some of them lost their grip a long time ago).<br />Of the two versions of _Dark Star_ included here, the sixty-eight minute \\"director's cut\\" is far superior. The eighty-three minute \\"theatrical release\\" feels padded, though most of that extra time involves an extended sequence in an asteroid field. This scene, added at the request (or demand, if you prefer) of shocksploitation producer Jack Harris, radically changes the plot, and blunts the film's satirical edge.<br />The DVD package is unimpressive; video and audio are uniformly bad, and extras are minimal.  Considering the film's production history and tiny budget, it's safe to say that _Dark Star_ looks and sounds as good now as it ever will.
6301871952|4.0|Giz is back, along with a group of green, scaly, evil monster gremlins.  Once again, the rules are broken and a new group of gremsters are formed, but this time it's in New York City inside a new, fully-automated office building.  The original cast is back (Phoebe Cates is still hot), along with some new people and new kinds of Gremlins after they mutate in a genetics lab.  We get a flying gremlin, a spider gremlin, and even a super-smart gremlin that can speak plain English.  This movie is hilarious, and it is a little less dark than the first, but there are still some gory scenes.  If you want a good time, see this movie, and see the original.
B00005B36H|5.0|If i had only one cd it would be laterulus. this cd is the music of my life. ilisten to it constantly, it helps me relax and is both soothing and musically superior to everything out there.<BR>I didnt buy it from amazon, nut i like this cd sooo much that i thought i should get more people to buy it.  but the only thing is you may not like it if you arent a true music fan. Its very different and is seemingly on a level of its own. my freind said to me what kind of music is it? and i couldnt answer him. Laterulus is definately worth checking out, so i say go for it.
0767836286|4.0|Arlington Road is a paranoid thriller, which means that the main character is paranoid (but usually correct) about the movie's villain.  In this movie, Jeff Bridges plays Micheal Faraday, a college professor who's wife was an FBI agent who died investigating a family mistakenly thought to be terrorists.  His new neighbor Oliver Lang (Tim Robbins) becomes his friend after Faraday saves his kid's life one day.  But after a while, Faraday begins to notice odd occurences with Lang.  I'll stop there because I don't want to give too much away.  <BR>The acting in this movie is astounding, and Robbins once again plays a great two-faced character (I say again because I saw Antitrust first, even though that was made later).  The only downside is that the ending leaves you wondering what happens next.  I have never before seen an ending like this movie's, and I was unable to predict it until one minute before it happened (usually I can predict an ending a mile away).  If you like thrillers, go see this movie.
B000001EPB|3.0|Great CD in its own right, but not as good as Ronan Hardiman's other compositions such as Solas or Anthem.  Also, DO NOT buy this CD with Feet of Flames - you will think you paid twice for the same material...and you would be right.
0679720200|5.0|When a friend reccommended The Stranger to me, I thought it would be a bleak display of the human soul, a sad depiction of how everyone and everything is pointless, but then I read it and gained a totally different perspective on Camus' work. The story paints a picture rather than weaves a tale. It blatanty lets you know whats going on without giving everything away, but it doesn't leave you in the dark, either. The senseless murder that the main character commits is totally synonomous with his point of view, and the way that the book is written, and the way that the book is translated, gives you a tough guy image of the character, while letting you find the humanity in him. I read this book thinking that it would be something I would read and never think about again, but it has become a work that I will use as a guide for the rest of my life.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|Excellent!  Brilliantly woven by director Victor Salva.  Listed below is the cast!<BR>Gina Phillips as TRISH<BR>Justin Long as DARRY<BR>Jonathan Breck as THE CREEPER<BR>Patricia Belcher as JEZELLE HARTMAN<BR>Eileen Brennan as THE CAT LADY<br />Now, there's just one thing wrong.  The previews played these heavy metal rocks songs and made this movie look so cool (don't get me wrong, it still was), but in the actual feature no music like that is played, and that was kind of a disappointment.  Anyway, the film's main plot is two teens, Trish and Darry, are driving home from college on a lonely, deserted highway.  After being nearly run off the road by some kamikaze driver in an old beatup truck, they cool off and continue on their road trip.  Later, they see the same truck parked at an old church, and its driver is dumping human bodies down a huge, rusty pipe.  After going back to investigate, the person who dumped the bodies down there is after them now, and he knows who they are.  After a while, we learn that this killer is not a man, but a demon.  For those of you who thought the killer was a person, you were way off!
B00005JKJA|1.0|Movie is really great.. But DVD [stink]s.. There are no Chapters, no special features. if you want to go to a scene in the dvd you have to rewind/FF, just like as you do in VHS. Don't waste your money in buying this dvd, buy VHS instead.
0385486804|5.0|I loved this book!  It kept me rapt from page one until the bitter end (I read it in one sitting).  It explores one man's desire to lead a Thoreau-esque life (as many of us have desired from time to time), and the consequences which ensued.  Moving and brilliantly written, which has become par for the course for Mr. Krakauer.  A must read!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a breath of fresh air in the increasing predictable world of superficial packaged music.  Mr. Wright probably didn't like Steely Dan's debut either.  Stick around, Rickey, you will have more chances with John Mayer. Listen more closely next time.

A must read!  Don't pass it up - you won't regret it!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Frankly, I'm sick of people calling John Mayer a \\"Dave Matthews wanna-be.\\" Mayer is a pioneer. He's an original. He's a musician's musician. Mayer does not lift his cheekbones in an effort to sound more like Matthews or Eddie Vedder (like that sorry... Creed dude), nor does he turn on a Luke Perry-esque breathy tenor tone to sound more like Sting or Jakob Dylan. While he may draw great similarities, Mayer is his own artist. He's more established as a musician and a songwriter at 24 than most other people his age are (boy bands, punk bands, people that write bad reviews about him, etc.). His knack for mixing old school rock, blues, jazz and folk along with his witty, poignant lyrics is something that connects him with his audience. His fans can relate to him. His fans can feel what he goes through in his songs, much like a reader can understand Emerson or a listener can understand Mozart. He's an oldie in a new generation. And probably the best thing about Mayer - forget the talent, forget the impeccable guitar skills and forget the infectious melodies - the best thing about Mayer is his love to play. He loves playing in front of people. Give him a guitar and a streetcorner and he'll probably play for hours ... for free. Room For Squares (along with his 1999 indie release Inside Wants Out) is a collection of some very good songs by a very young musician who's career is seemingly limitless. From the funky \\"No Such Thing\\" to the frustrating \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" to the lovely \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" to the bluesy \\"City Love\\" to the melancholic \\"83\\" to the masterful \\"3x5\\" to the sweet \\"Back To You\\" to the culmination of \\"St. Patrick's Day,\\" this album is probably one of the greatest releases not talked about in 2001. His unreleased stuff is even better, namely \\"Victoria,\\" the unplugged versions of \\"No Such Thing\\" and \\"Neon,\\" and the downright beatiful love song \\"Comfortable.\\" Find all you can - live recordings, bootlegs, etc. Listening to a John Mayer recording is likelistening to the beginnings of a legendary career unfold. With inspirations from Stevie Ray Vaughn to Eric Clapton to Hank Mobley to Dave Matthews, Mayer has built a strong enough foundation to last himself a lifetime in the music business. Room for Squares only proves that there is room for real musicians in this candy-pop world. Thank God for John Mayer.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Bergman, Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Welles. A week ago, I would never have thought to have included David Lynch among these visionary masters. But then I purchased the DVD for Mulholland Drive on a whim (something I rarely do for films Ive never seen). I sat one night in front of the flat screen in my LA home, put the disc into the player, and was held captive for two and a half hours by a work of startling cinematic genius. It was, like all great films, a work that haunted me for days afterwards; a work that I wanted to immediately share with those closest to me -- but only those who would be willing, and able, to work through a very difficult film to the harrowing truths that glowered beneath the surface like a brilliant blue light.<br />There are many good filmmakers. There are some great filmmakers. But those handful who are considered true masters, true geniuses of the cinema, all share one trait: they adhere almost religiously to the idea of film as a Visual art form. Simply put, they allow the images, and the arrangement of those images, to tell the story. They arent content, as most mainstream filmmakers are, with allowing a linear written narrative to wholly dictate the visual presentation of their films. Rather, they respect the raw, organic nature of an idea, they allow that idea to spread its roots, and they cull the images and the sounds together that will bend to the inclinations of that idea. Thus, these films, like Mulholland Drive, do not follow the simplistic but comforting A-B trajectory of most films, which are usually nothing more than cinematic renderings of novels. (Film and Literature are equally important artistic mediums; but the masters understand that they are essentially very distinct animals and should be treated as such.)<br />And so it is that Mulholland Drive, like Bergmans Persona, Fellinis 8 1/2, and Kurosawas Rashomon, decidedly turns traditional linear narrative upside down andinside out, and does so gleefully. Lynchs film is like a prolonged fever dream of the most intense human emotions: paranoia, anger, grief, jealousy, remorse and a soul-wrenching despair. It is a work that transcends its film noir underpinnings and becomes, ultimately, an incisive examination of Hollywood as Dream Factory and of the troubling implications that arise from our unquestioning willingness to embrace its position as such. Lynch seems to suggest that our willingness to surrender to the dream that is Hollywood makes us complicit in the crimes that Hollywood then commits to further sustain that dream. And he doesn't exclude himself from this complicity (the brash young filmmaker Adam Kesher is arguably a self-parody).<br />I will not discuss the specifics of the plot because I think that would be a true injustice for those who have not yet had the privilege of working through this masterpiece. All I will say is that of all of the films from all over the world that I have had the honor of taking into my mind and my heart, few have shaken me as much as Mulholland Drive. I cannot emphasize enough how brilliant Naomi Watts performance is in this film. To even call it a performance seems like an insult. I have rarely, if ever, seen a young actress so fully inhabit the skin of her character as Ms. Watts does here. Her character arc in this film is not simply A to B to C. It is more like BA to AB to C, and what a heartbreaking C it is. Those of you who have seen and understood the heart of the film will know what I mean.<br />Mr. Lynch and Ms. Watts, if you are reading this, one lowly cinephile salutes you.
6302636779|5.0|&#34;The Nun's Story&#34; is probably Audrey Hepburn's best film and by far the one which shows to best effect her enormous acting talent.  It is the autobiographical tale of Sister Luke, a very young Belgian nun, who enters the convent at age 17 for specifically the wrong reason: her doctor father refuses to let her marry the young man she loves because there is insanity in his family background.  She won't admit to him, as she is too young to admit it to herself, that her underlying reason in entering the convent was to spite her father, who believes women have a duty to marry and have children, but he is powerless to oppose her in this; he can prevent her from marrying her fiance, but who is he to defy God?  Sister Luke, as played by Hepburn, wins us over instantly: she's generous, open-hearted, all or nothing, trying and failing and trying again, expecting too much of herself, wanting to fit in to the routine of her cloister, but feeling stifled by its constraints.  The atmosphere of the convent is brought so vividly to life that we feel the conflicts pulling her in opposite directions: the peace and serenity that are embodied in the Reverend Mother Emmanuel (Edith Evans is so great in this role that she doesn't seem to be acting at all), and the incessant weight of seemingly arbitrary and nonsensical rules and regulations that attempt to crush all individuality and spontaneity.<br /><br />The pivotal conflict arises in the first half of the movie, when Sister Luke is asked by her Mother Superior to fail a qualifying examination for a nursing post in the Congo so that a less gifted nun can have her place, and Sister Luke has to make a choice: her failure will be a gift from God, but her success in the examination will win her a position in the Congolese hospital where her talents can be most fully utilized.  And this is where Sister Luke has to face her inner dilemma: the convent, with all its rules and regulations, hasn't managed to crush her individuality -- she is too much her own person to let go of herself.<br /><br />It is in the Congo that Sister Luke comes into her own.  She falls in love with the country and its people as soon as she steps off the boat.  She is sent to the European hospital to assist Dr. Fortunati, a brilliant, cynical surgeon who immediately sees through Sister Luke and understands her better than she understands herself.  The meeting of minds between these two is awesome to watch and in itself makes the movie worth seeing.  Dr. Fortunati, brilliantly played by Peter Finch, tells Sister Luke time and again that she will never be the kind of nun her convent expects her to be.  The sexual tension between the two is evident but downplayed; Dr. Fortunati knows it's impossible and Sister Luke simply refuses to acknowledge it.  The climax comes when Sister Luke is ordered back to the mother house in Belgium, and we suspect that Dr. Fortunati may have had a hand in it, to force her to face up to the fact that she is more nurse than nun.<br /><br />The year is 1939 and World War II is about to begin.  Sister Luke, chafing at the constraints of the mother house, is drawn into the war in ways her convent never imagined or would sanction.  She assists a young lay nurse, who looks up to her as a role model, to work for the Resistance.  She is glad when a German woman dies in the convent hospital.  And she is finally forced to see inside herself and realize that while she may be able to accept chastity and poverty, obedience is impossible.  At this point Sister Luke realizes she can no longer go on living a lie.  The scenes in which her confessor and Reverend Mother Emmanuel attempt to dissuade her from leaving the convent are the most powerful in the film.  &#34;You joined the convent to be a nun, not a nurse&#34;, remonstrates Reverend Mother.  But this is precisely where she's wrong; Sister Luke is much more a nurse than she will ever be a nun.  After 17 years at war with herself, Sister Luke signs the papers severing her from her convent, and goes out into the world.<br /><br />Hepburn's performance in a role which demands so much from her is incredible; we not only feel but share all her conflict and inner pain.  There is no way she could come across as a plain, mousy nun (Hepburn would be drop-dead beautiful even in a burlap sack) but her acting is so convincing that we forget she is the gorgeous Audrey Hepburn and see her only as a soul in torment.  Peter Finch is excellent as Dr. Fortunati and all of the minor characters are very well portrayed, but the real soul of the movie is Edith Evans as Reverend Mother Emmanuel, concerned with the spiritual health of her flock, and despairing yet fatalistic as one of her flock inexorably slips away.  The movie is long (two and a half hours) but it's never boring; it grabs our interest from the opening frame and holds it to the final frame in which Hepburn turns a corner out of the convent grounds and out of our sight.  The one jarring note, especially after 40 years, is the patronizing paternalism of the Belgian colonization in the Congo; except for the education and medical care provided by the Church, the cruelty of Belgian colonial occupation was legendary and makes us wonder what Sister Luke's fate would have been if she had returned to the Congo after she left the convent.  At the end of the film we are left with great respect and admiration for an incredibly strong yet fallible young woman whose journey to self-knowledge is a life-long project.<br /><br />Judy Lindnvent, and goes out into the world.

B00005JKJA|3.0|When I saw this movie in the theater I found it utterly repellent and amateurish--I was especially disappointed with Naomi Watts for what I then thought was some of the worst acting I'd seen in years.  I left the theater revolted by the whole affair.  But then a strange thing happened.  I couldn't get the movie out of my head at all.  And I have long respected David Lynch as a filmmaker, so I began to think more and more about what he must have intended in the movie.  I decided that I would get the DVD and wade into the weird waters again just to see, and I'm glad I did--plus, I felt safer watching this flick in the comfort of my own home.  This is a film that demands to be seen more than once, and Naomi Watts's acting, I now realize, is mesmerizing in its range.  Of course she's meant to be totally fake and hokey at first, and her \\"character\\" goes through myriad iterations, in both \\"acting\\" and Acting, if that makes any sense.  The more I read about this movie from writers and critics I respect the more I see in Mullholland Drive.<BR>But the DVD package is very annoying for what it lacks--except for offering the trailer and cast bios, there's nothing extra on it.  In fact, worst of all, THERE ARE NO CHAPTER STOPS FOR SCENE SELECTION, and this is one of the main reasons people buy DVD's!  So you are forced to fast forward to get to spots you want, which raises the question why is this on DVD in the first place?
B00005JKJA|1.0|it plays like a straight VHS video, which is unforgivable (worse, it takes longer to get to a middle scene than a videotape). Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it.
B000056NX5|4.0|Being raised on Jesus Christ Superstar, I have to say that I was perfectly thrilled when this new version arrived. I am not thrilled with some of the high notes of Glenn Carter but he was a great actor. I did see the show live and was so impressed with the modern staging. Big difference from the desert version! I have only one complaint about this video- I wish it was filmed as one would have seen it live. I didn't like all the trick shots and some of the camera angles. Being a person who saw it live, I noticed some scenes were not included in the video. Overall, it was fantastic. By the way, the kids (both 6 years old) sing just about all the songs. Buy it!!
B00001ODGR|5.0|This DVD, bought last year, was my first music/concert video purchase. It was a good choice and led to about 30 more purchases over the last 6 months or so. The video is clear, camera work is good and the sound is great. I was using an old Dolby Pro-Logic setup when I bought this but have since upgraded to a full DD 5.1/DTS home theatre system. This DVD sounded really good with my old system but, in comparison, sounds awesome now. In this concert (the songs are listed somewhere else on this page so I won't repeat them), Styx performs most of my favorites and the band is tight. I saw them live in Houston back in the 80's and again this year at the Rodeo in the Astrodome - not a good venue for concerts.  But this live concert on DVD is better in many respects since you get to see the band close-up and the sound is almost as good as being there, if you have a good sound system. Also, I think the current Styx lineup misses something without the great voice of Dennis DeYoung.  So, if you like the original Styx lineup, this is the DVD to get.  Also, if you like to see closeups of the musicians when they are playing, the camera work with respect to that is fairly good.  I've seen better on other DVDs but you do get some shots of JY and Tommy doing the riffs from some of the classic Styx hits. <br />I would say this DVD a must-have for STYX fans and very entertaining for anyone else who likes \\"middle-of-the-road classic rock\\" (i.e. somewhere between \\"soft rock\\" and \\"heavy metal\\").  I give it 5 stars based on 1) video and camera work, 2) 5.1 sound track and 3) the fact that I've always liked Styx's music and most of my favorites are on this DVD.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Before judging the story line or the actors, I fell in love with the cinematography. I thought it was like looking at one of the pop-up Victorian cards. After getting over being blown away with the filming, I started really paying attention to Nicole Kidman and Ewen McGreggor. Her voice is really sweet and wonderful. I loved her entrance into the movie with Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend. Ever get a song stuck in your head? Well, CanCan has been there for days. I find myself singing it outloud sometimes. Get this video!
B000002J09|5.0|There's a reason why this album tends to end up at the top of the pile in many of the reviews of 'best rock album of all time'. It's pretty damn good from the opening delay on Black Dog to the collage of sounds that end the roaring When the Levee Breaks this is simply a great rock album. No album is perfect but this is probably the defining album of Rock (if anyone has any other ideas for this title then I'd like to hear them but I think you'll find that Zeppelin got there first) It's got pretty much everything, thunderous rock, beautiful acoustic playing and some straight-up blues, with some hobbits, faeries and elves thrown in for good measure.  If you don't own this album then chances are that your either the most pretentious muso on the planet or \\"Britney is more your thing\\". <br />Buy this album and play it LOUD!
B00000ICD9|4.0|This movie rips into you (if you are one of those people that cries easily). I loved the artistic qualities (her paintings coming to life). This movie had all the makings of being perfect, until the end. I think someone got confused about how it should end. Or maybe they decided to lighten it up and give it a happier ending. The main character was meant to be a tragic person. It didn't make sense that she should try life again. Overall, the movie was pretty good and I recommend owning it.

B00005JKJA|5.0|There's no other movie like MULHOLLAND DRIVE. That's the first time I can say that and really mean it. I was totally baffled seeing it in the theater and now with the DVD I'll be able to watch it again and again and maybe one day I'll understand every detail of the plot. Everything's there, but it's up to the audience to figure it all out.<br />As for all the pathetic complaints about something so mundane as chapter stops, I have to ask the question, why does anyone feel they really need them for this film? Is it merely just because other DVDs have them? Well, on a ton of other DVDs it makes sense, but I can't imagine trying to break down MULHOLLAND DRIVE into separate chapters. I really don't consider the whole movie a bunch of scenes put together. I only see the movie as a complete whole. David Lynch was right on the money when he backed up his work by saying that. How do you jump to a random scene in MULHOLLAND DRIVE anyway? How could you start watching this movie from any other place besides the beginning? It just doesn't work like that. If you don't like the movie just for the single reason that the DVD has no chapter stops, then don't buy it. Simple as that.<br />My only complaint about the DVD might have been the high retail price, but now is the time to buy it while it's still new and cheap! I did not miss chapter stops at all watching my DVD for the first time and I didn't feel like the DVD was \\"lacking\\" any extras. Do you really think Lynch would do a commentary track on this movie? Come on......<br />Extras are sometimes thrown onto DVDs because the idea is that they will make a bad movie look good. As you can see in this case it is totally unnecessary. The movie is just all you need.
B00005YW4H|2.0|After having this CD recommended to me by a jazz fan whose opinion I generally respect, I was quite disappointed. Though there is nothing aurally offensive here, there's nothing that rises above the usual current jazz/pop female vocalist. Jones really doesn't have much of a vocal instrument. Her readings are breathily similar throughout the album, whose tracks reveal a stultifying sameness in terms of range and mood. There's no power to this voice, and those who compare it to Billie Holiday (or even the vastly overrated Ms. Krall) are just kidding themselves. Jones has a wisp of a voice, and even her highly praised interpretations wear thin. I've given this several listenings, and though I've wanted to be persuaded that there's more here than I initially thought, I'm convinced that there isn't. Listen to the sample tracks before you purchase -- if this is up your alley, you'll know it right away. As for me, I like more strength and a bit of breath control, neither of which Jones seems to possess.
6303407188|5.0|The title of my review speeks for itself. While Stanley Kubrick's movie is bizarre beyond my belief, this one has the heart that the former lacks. Ironically, this one (being more of a drama) is by far funnier than most comedies that have come out in theaters in the past decade, and smarter too. This one actually has a story and all of the actors performances are amazing.
B00003CXWV|4.0|Blow is a movie about George Jung, a man who transforms himself from a small time marijuana dealer to a big time cocaine dealer. At the peak of his power, George Jung estimates he was responsible for supplying 85% of America's cocaine demand. The movie traces George's life from his early childhood, through to his final incarceration at the OTIS Correctional Facility.<br />The movie has an excellent cast with a very powerful performance by Johnny Depp. He successfully portrays both the fun loving, carefree George as well as the older, hardened, more serious George. Even though it is difficult to condone George's lifestyle choices, I think everyone can empathise with his desire to \\"take nothing...and turn it into something\\". Isn't that after all what we are all trying to do? The movie moves along at a fast pace and you are constantly kept on the edge of your seat.<br />The one criticism I have of the movie is that at the end, it strays from the truth in an effort to romanticise George's life and his personal choices. I don't want to spoil things for anybody, but once you've seen the movie feel free to visit [website] to catch the truth on the ending of George Jung's saga.<br />I can still thoroughly recommend this movie. It's not just a movie about drugs. I think George Jung's life contains many lessons which can benefit us all.
079073804X|4.0|the exorcist is a well made movie. it is also one of the most terrifying movies i have ever seen. i still get scared thinking about the possessed girls voice. scary...also based on a true story, so that makes it even scarier. i reccomend that everyone at least rent it.
B00003CXXP|4.0|The critics didn't seem to like this one and I'm not sure why: it's an updated re-telling of \\"Pinnochio\\" and is the fruit of the collaboration between two cinema giants, Kubrick and Spielberg. Both influences are readily apparent and that means there is a lot that's right and wonderful about this film. Perhaps the critics were expecting a massive blockbuster from these two titans, but the truth is, in a way, it's really a \\"small\\" film- not a combination of \\"Star Wars\\" and \\"2001\\" as the critics may have drooled for.<BR> Under the glossy surface it's the simple story of a boy searching for his mother's love. Sure he's an android and it's set in a nightmarish hi-tek world but in the end it's just a magical fairy tale. As a movie it works on lot of levels- all the ingredients are there: Haley Joel Osment's amazing performance (actually, all the performances are quite good), amazing sets, costumes, special effects and a haunting score by John Wlliams. There are striking imaginative touches throughout this film and in virtually every production aspect.<BR> Some argue that the movie should have ended at an earlier point  than it does (to say more would be to give something away-you'll know what I mean when you see it) and  true, it would probably have been a satisfying if deeply poignant way to end the film, but it would have deprived us of  Speilberg's fascinating coda and the emotional release that we all secretly (or not so secretly) wish for throughout  the film. Is it a little too precious an ending? Maybe, but remember it's *just* a fairy tale. A thought provoking fairy tale, yes but to see it as trying to be much more than that does a disservice to this fine film and to Speilberg, Kubrick and \\"Pinnochio\\" as well. I  really didn't expect to like \\"A.I.\\" based on the reviews but I enjoyed it very much and I think you will too.<BR>Recommended
B00000I9MK|5.0|If you are like me, then music holds a special place in your heart.  Probably, just above doughnuts and right below a back scratch.  To this end, a tune's lyricalness, if you will, tends to evoke certain emotional responses within all of us.  I.E., some Zeppelin to get you up for a work out or, how about a little Vavaldi to calm the nerves.  I'd wager that all of you have particular musicians or songs that tweak each mood spot (And I do mean all of them).<br />That said brings us to the septet from Glasgow, \\"Belle and Sebastian\\".  Recorded in 5 days for a college course,  \\"B & S's\\" 1996 release \\"Tiger Milk\\" is a paradoxical quagmire of emotion served on a velvet carpet with a sprinkle of vinegar.  A cursory listen to Stuart Murdoch's undulating brogue would leave one feeling gleeful and at peace with the universe.  Yet, with a thorough listen one discovers a heartbreaking pathos covered in pop bliss.  In this lies the genius of this album.  Almost a metaphor for, lets say, the 1950's, \\"Tiger Milk\\" lures you in with a false façade of light fluff.  If unaware, you'd slide through this disk.  Yet, those who know better can't help but to relate to their frustration and regret of living in a world where the majority are oblivious to the evils around them.  Remember what happened because of the ignorance of the `50's?  That's right, the 60's, `nuff said.<br />\\"B & S\\" cover the emotional wasteland from abyss to abyss.  To surf these lyrically adroit dunes, one needs to give over to the entire concept.  You can't just bound from song to song and expect to comprehend the work.  Which, in this case, is precisely the point.  How often do we prejudge a piece before we complete the puzzle?  How often do we blindly accept what's served to us just because it's served to us?  How often do we follow just because we feel the need to be lead?  Viable questions.  Ask your self, why?  I'd bet, again, that all your answers will sound startlingly similar to the lyrics drifting through \\"Tiger Milk\\".<br />Imagine a vanilla ice-cream cone on a hot day.  It's just sitting there.  You dash to it and without thinking, nosh headlong.  Unfortunately, you soon discover the scrumptious looking scoop is actually made of lard.  Now, if you took the time to think you'd notice the ice cream wasn't melting.  A trifle simple allegory, but you get the point.  In my opinion, anything that stimulates that thing bopping around in your skull deserves, at least, a peek.  And \\"Tiger Milk\\" certainly earns one.<br />Depending on your mood, \\"Bell and Sebastian\\" will stir-up a plethora of sentiments.  It's mostly reliant on which personal issues are closest to your conscience surface.  Whatever your motivations, \\"Tiger Milk\\" will leave you with a stark impression.  As for me, that's something I'll just keep tucked between doughnuts and a back scratch.

B00005RHGK|4.0|Well, while some people say this was the stupidest movie, I say not. This isn't your average horror/slasher movie, folks. This is your creepy, orginal movie. You'll be getting the creeps for the first half of the movie and my god, the Creeper is scary until you actually see him up close. Aw, but the whole shadowy-undertaker-figure makes this guy look...scary. The movie has got pretty much everything here: Your comedy, chills, and what not many scary movies have...not exactly a happy ending! For once the &quot;good guys&quot; didn't completely win! It's a fun movie to watch at night-you'll be entertained thorughout the movie.
B00000273M|4.0|...this album is a collection of their greatest hits, which means you are going to hear the most familiar of The Bangles' catalog.  Regardless of the virtues or undiscovered gems of some of the group's less popular recordings, this album is about the hits!

B00005A1PR|5.0|India Aire's Album is a testament of true talent. Her album is filled with Spiritually moving and spirit filled songs that will leave you feeling great about the person you are. With songs like  Part of My Life, I see God In You, Always in My Head & Ready for love, It talks about loving and being loved on a whole other plain that you just don't find in your typical comercial R&B that's currently out there. She is a cut above the rest if not the best, who's sound is fresh and unique. And I am sure, I am not alone when i say that she did indeed deserve a GRAMMY For such a moving album!
B00003CXZ3|5.0|If you've never seen this movie and are planning to, let me warn you: make sure you're awake. You want to remember it, because the first time is the best. You ARE Leonard, because you know exactly what he knows - no more, no less. You must decide whether you trust the other characters using your own judgement, precisely the way Leonard is doing. You may agree or disagree with his assessments, but ultimately, you're as blind as he. There's an ambience to watching this film the first time that you won't be able to capture again, so you'll want to be coherent.<br />Which isn't to say that this movie isn't excellent the second time around, or the third, or the fourth . . . it's still an enthralling few hours or so. Each time you watch it, you pick up on new nuances that you missed before, so it doesn't really get old. Besides, the acting in this film is absolutely smashing. Guy Pierce is amazing as a protagonist who, while a less-than-perfect individual, is a mirror of ourselves. Because you almost literally become Leonard, Carrie-Anne Moss' Natalie is that much more heart-breaking, leaving you bitter. And who could forget Teddy . . . ah, Teddy. You're never really sure if you can trust him. You want to, but you can't quite manage it. Even after it's all over, and the facts are revealed, you'll still have lingering doubts about Teddy. <br />Ultimately, this is not a movie for those who like a nice, tidy ending. Nor is it for those who dislike an aftertaste; this film will stick with you for quite awhile. While not a pleasant little movie, it is pure genius, and for those who can handle a bit of cynicism - after all, it conditions you to trust no one, because everyone's out for themselves, and no one (repeat, NO ONE) thinks twice about exploiting Leonard - this is an absolute must.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I am a school teacher and have used this film as a teaching tool in my American History classes, in part, and as a whole, for more than fifteen years.  Yes, it has some historical inaccuracies, but good history is also a good story. And what a heroic, tragic story this is.  This film brilliantly portrays the honest efforts of Jesuits to spread the word of God, and how those efforts often ran head first into the interests of those who wished to profit, including the Catholic Church itself.  Jeremy Irons portrayal as a dedicated cleric brings tears to ones eyes and Robert De Niro's redemption at the hands of the Amazon Indians and conversion to the priesthood is a remarkable story in itself.  Some people view it as an anti-Christian film, my opinion is quite the opposite.  The Jesuits in this film are characters to be emulated and admired.
B00000IQUT|1.0|I put reality because this is a very strong depiction of what rape is and how men can be. It made me nauseous just watching it, and I read the other reviews on here about it and was very offended by the guy who wrote \\"if your a man the bathroom scene will make you squirm\\". Well, the man in the tub had brutaly raped this woman and deserved what he got, in my opinion if your a man watching this film what should make you squirm would be the scenes of the rape and just knowing that you are part of the male species that commit this horrific act. Dont watch this if you have ever been raped, it will bring flashbacks.
6301095014|1.0|This movie was an embarrasment to the filmmakers. First of all, extremely unrealistic- Rambo shoots a few bullets at a Soviet helicopter and it explodes like a toy. Second, this film is very boring- for about 45 minutes, Rambo and his Afghan friends walk around with angry faces and discuss how awful the Russians are.<BR>Third, I wonder why do Americans always hit their targets and Russians always miss?
0062502182|4.0|Okay, so this book won't change your life.....nor is it very profound.<br />That disclaimer stated, I still recommend it. It is a sweet, simple story about following your dream. Something which I feel not enough people do in their own lives.<br />I was especially gratified that the author doesn't delude us with the lie that once you decide to embark on the journey it's all going to be a simple skip down a rose strewn path.....we are shown and told the many obstacles that follow the \\"beginners luck\\" that comes with the initial commitment to many dreams.<br />And as I said.....it's a sweet story. Memorable, even. So read it, give it to friends. It won't hurt you....in fact, I believe it's a book you'll recall often with fond memories.

0060987464|5.0|but for anyone who believes that they know what Manson is about, because outside of his fans, nobody does. I read this book wanting to know and try to understand what makes Marilyn click, and he has answered all of  my questions. This book is a very good read, very interesting, and quite addictive. Marilyn writes about his life experiences which tranformed him into what he is today. He tells you his views on alot of subjects in a very insightful way. After reading this you will understand and will discover that many of his views will make you question things that go on in our world and make you realize a few other truths that perhaps most of us don't like to admit or just never really give alot of thought to. Marilyn is very caring, funny, and a genius. He is usually misunderstood by a widely judgemental and self-rightoues society. So for any one who \\"thinks\\" that they know what he is about, read this, and he will succeed in setting the record straight.
B00005R2IS|4.0|Y'know, when I'm in the mood to watch a good post-apocalypse movie with lotsa high-speed cars & `cycles, and plenty of collisions & explosions, I just gotta turn to the original `Mad Max' to satiate my needs! And the new DVD presentation of `Mad Max' does just that! Not only do I get both the original Australian AND US-dub voice tracks, I also get a better picture than what I used to see on my now-well-worn VHS tape of the flick! The picture isn't absolutely perfect, though, but this is more likely due to the quality of the original print than the quality of the transfer to DVD.<br />Although I'm happy to finally be able to view and hear `Mad Max' in its original Australian dialogue, I have a certain sense of nostalgia for the American dub as well, as it gives the flick more of a weird Godzilla-like style & cheesiness to it! But if I had my `druthers, I'd take the original voice track. Why, you ask? Well, there's just something not quite right about an American-accented voice-over uttering \\"strewth!\\", you know? But never the less, I have fun switching back and forth between the two tracks as I'm watching. I'm amazed by how well-synchronized they are-- I click from Aussie to Yankee & back, and I miss narry a word of the dialogue! And yes, people, this IS my idea of a good time. Pretty sad, huh?<br />Anyway, on to the special features. The commentary track contains the usual mix of anecdotes and behind-the-scenes memories that one has come to expect from movie commentary tracks. I was somewhat disappointed none of the four contributors was co-writer/director George Miller, but I guess I'll just have to deal with it. Then there's the trivia feature, which works somewhat like VH1's Pop-Up music video in that it comes on the screen every several seconds with a new factoid about the flick. Many of the trivia tidbits cover the make & model of the various cars, trucks, and motorcycles that appear here, as well as letting the non-Aussie viewer in on some of the native lingothat's heard here. Also mentioned are some of the technical aspects of particular scenes, as well as revealing where certain scenes were shot. Unfortunately, I've read that some of the lingo & location trivia bits are incorrect. Which is something of a letdown, but at least I've been given fair warning...<br />Also included are a couple of documentaries which cover the making of `Mad Max' as well as taking a look at the early days of Mel Gibson's acting career. Like the commentary track, there's plenty of amusing anecdotes and details about the more technical parts of the movie, especially the great crash & collision stunts that one sees throughout the flick. One of the BTS doc's interviewees even refers to `Mad Max' as being \\"porn for people who like fast cars\\" because of all the high-velocity vehicles and stunts! Now that's a most unusual analogy if ever I saw (or, rather, heard) one! Other neat momes include the fanboy who bought and restored Mad Max's MFP Interceptor, and the prop that helped make the Toecutter's eye-popping demise so memorable!<br />`Late!
6304211740|2.0|\\"Jane Eyre\\" is a very good novel by an extraordinary author. The people associated with the project obviously did not agree. They decided that the REAL story would not sell and the that the author was obviously wrong in every decision she made as far as plot, character and theme. Basically, it doesn't seem like the people who made this movie even LIKE \\"Jane Eyre\\" or even READ it. The plot isn't even reminiscent of the novel's tone and message. Jane Eyre is transformed from a strong, moral woman to a wishy-washy girl and every single supporting character is massacred cruelly. How can anyone who liked the book like this movie? This adaptation takes the deep psychological journey of Jane Eyre and turns it into a boring, dark and superficial romance tale. I don't think it could've been any worse. Jane's childhood is, granted, done pretty well. But every single change made to the original (and there are tons) makes the movie that much worse and is an attempt to mass market the sensational parts of the story and downplay the intellect. Simply embarrassing for Zeffirelli and everyone involved. I would recommend this movie to be burned by anyone who loved the book.

0790749815|5.0|...   two ex-wives, and several bartenders dependent on me. (Carey Grant) <br />This movie has it all. A great (original) script by Ernest Lehman. One of Bernard Hermanns scores. James Mason playing a sinister villain.  Martin Landau and even more chilling villain and in his strongest performance in a supporting role. Eva Marie Saint (who I wouldnt have picked for the female lead, but then thats why Im not the one making movies this good) at her sultry best. Carey Grant, always debonair, the very picture of suave, in the best role he ever had. And the best filmmaker ever: Alfred Hitchcock. Theres the one-liners that only Grant can deliver. Humor. Drama. Suspense. Theres a murder in the UN. A chase in a cornfield by a bi-plane, which is one of the most famous chase scenes. And a fight across Mount Rushmore. The Hitchcock film to end all Hitchcock films.<br />Ive seen DVDs that contain more extras and Ive seen DVDs that contain less. This has some 50 production stills, the tv trailer, the theatrical trailer, and the Hitchcock trailer. There is a 40 minute documentary on the making of the movie. The documentary just covers the basics, so dont expect all the hard details, but its worth watching. Unfortunately neither Hitch nor Carey Grant were around to do a commentary, so the next best thing, Ernest Lehman, did the commentary. Actually, it turns out that his interview for the making of documentary (in its less edited form)  is whats laid out over the movie. Which might explain why there are large gaps of no commentary and why there arent as many insights as to why he wrote a scene one way versus another. You do get some colorful stories about Hitch and the making of this movie, and at one point Lehman goes into detail about the writing of the script. Its not the best commentary Ive seen, but worthwhile. There is also a music only track for the serious student of Hitchcock. Its probably not something anyone other than afilm student is going to watch (over two hours with no dialogue and at times no music takes a certain level of commitment). But if you want to see just how effective Hermanns score is, there is no better way to do it. <br />North By Northwest is one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies ever made. The DVD isnt spectacular but it does contain a few perks.

B00001OH7N|4.0|Bowie's foray into hard rock has the sound he would later use for Ziggy and the Spiders, courtesy of Mick Ronson's distinctive proto-punk guitars.<br />Ronson's \\"da da-da-da-da\\" guitar solo in \\"All The Madmen\\" reminds me of Led Zeppelin's solos on the first two Zep albums.<br />The acoustic exercise of \\"After All\\" is a style to be carried over in Hunky Dory.  The cold but rocking \\"Running Gun Blues\\" sounds like a reaction to Americans in Vietnam...P>The concept of \\"Saviour Machine\\" is an interesting one, about a machine that solves all of mankind's problems and is taken for granted as a kind of god until it gets bored and begs mankind to disagree with it for once.  \\"Staking your lives on a saviour machine\\"--well, Americans seem to stake their lives on many machines in its technologically glutted age.<br />I wonder if \\"Supermen\\" is a reference to the gods of ancient mythology, be it Greek or Norse.  It could be Norse, as the concept of supermen and giants exist in the Ring of the Nibelungen.<br />The title track has been done by Lulu and Nirvana, but the original by Bowie rules.  The question is, \\"sold the world\\" to whom?  Faceless corporations?  The gray industrial landscape of the 1970's?<br />This 1970 album showed Bowie as a potential force to be reckoned with, but it's with Hunky Dory that he really excelled himself.
0679879269|5.0|In this thrilling conclusion to the Dark Materials trilogy Philip Pullman questions theology itself.

B000002NZO|4.0|The checkered history of Genesis remains a puzzle to me: no real way to ever reconcile \\"The Musical Box\\" with \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" with \\"Cinema Show\\" or any of the trite hits that came near the third or fourth end. No way that \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\" prefigures or implies \\"Trespass\\". But, to my ear, this period remains the band's best, and it is their most meaningful accomplishment - the trilogy of \\"Trespass\\", \\"Nursery Cryme\\" and \\"Fox Trot\\".  What sales were like, I don't recall. Only 200 showed up when their Foxtrot tour found it's way to Seattle. And, in the world of progressive music, I always put them behind King Crimson, Van der Graaf, Caravan, Soft Machine, Yes and several others. And after seeing Peter Gabriel sing \\"That'll Do: Theme from Babe, Pig in The City\\" at the Oscars a few years ago, I felt the confusing and unfocused aesthetic that Genesis put across individually and as aband had finally reached its zenith, or nadir. Yikes.<br />But here's something: in listening to \\"Trespass\\" you can literally hear the lads feel their way to something new and defining for the group. It's almost as if the tracks were recorded in the order they were written. Once we get past the intrinsicly lame \\"White Fang\\" (\\"Fang's frantic paws told the tale of his sin\\", a particularly bizarre line from the uniformly uninteresting lyrics whose serious and weighty delivery can only make you grin today) things pick up nicely. And by the time we reach track five, \\"Dusk\\", we know we're really somewhere. \\"Dusk\\" manages to put several musical themes in motion, summing in an energetic, elegant and moving chorus. Setting us up for a classic.<br />Much can be made of \\"The Knife\\". The protestors chanting near the climax sound like a small crowd today and the gun fire is perhaps too overt, too manipulative. But, we finally have some fine music.

B00005JKBC|1.0|To turn off the captions in this movie, one has to go all the way back to the menu [the regular 'subtitle' hot key is locked off for the dvd], wait through 5-10 seconds of music clip, scroll through the menu, turn them off, and once that happens, they stay off for 1-3 minutes at a time.<br />note, these are the captions [which are mostly on screen, not just near the bottom edge, either], not the discreet subtitles.<br />I doubt it will affect every dvd player, but it was extremely distracting... it was an effort to get through the movie.

0066620694|4.0|This book focuses on new product ideas at big enterprises and how they should be pursued. If there is no current market for these new products and naturally no customer base, these technologies are called disruptive technologies.<br />And Christensen is telling us, the only way to make these new product technologies successful is to spin off a new division and treat it like a startup with corporate financial backing.<br />His studies show that the corporations that do not follow this rules have always failed.<br />I recommend this book to product managers, senior engineers at big corporations with new product ideas. This book should be helpful to define a strategy to form the idea into a commercially viable product or service.
B000035P7X|5.0|This black and white film portrays Dylan's last acoustic tour in such an intimate and natural way that the viewer gets the impression of participating in its gradual unfolding. Shot by DA Pennebaker as cinema verite', the innovative techniques used in the film appropriately mirror the innovation that was taking place in popular music at the time, spearheaded primarily by Bob Dylan. The viewer, like a fly on the wall, gets to see Dylan in different settings and situations: moments of tension backstage, hanging out with the likes of Alan Price, Donovan, John Mayall and Marianne Faithful, giving interviews, singing old Hank Williams songs in hotel rooms with Joan Baez, on stage in theatres across England, fooling about with Bob Neuwirth. It's all there.....and more! <BR>Apart from the original film, the DVD offers the viewer the unique opportunity of seeing the film (again!) with an ongoing commentary by Pennebaker and Neuwirth themselves, who shed light into what went into nearly every scene. <BR>Besides, the DVD also includes 5 previously unreleased audio tracks (crystal clear quality) recorded in various locations in England during that same tour.<BR>A fascinating and revealing experience not only for the diehard Dylan fan.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver takes place in a Utopian society where everything is under control and there are no choices, war, fear, or pain.  I think that the author, Lois Lowry, presents a glimpse of what our world could one day be like through the eyes of a young boy named Jonas.  It would be a world with no war, pain, and homelessness, but also no love,feelings, colour, and happiness.  In this novel, I think that the author presents us with a powerful thought that forces us to reflect about our lives until we can really appreciate the true meaning of life.  I would strongly recommend The Giver to anyone of any age, because I feel it has a significant meaning to get across to all its readers. The Giver is an excellent novel that ultimately depends upon the opinion and interpretation of each of its readers to create the ending. If you ever need a book to read, try reading The Giver, I would be surprised if you didnt enjoy it!

0140277447|5.0|THE question that keeps haunting me most is how's the course of event is going to unfold if the RAPE happens today. My answer is nothing much is going to change. The Chinese are as timid and docile ( or patient, depends on your point of view which usually depends on your nationality) as they were in 1937 and still could not fight back for the injustices imposed on them. The Japanese sense of right or  wrong are as ambiguous as they used to be: when you are in power, then what you do to the weak is always right and the hell with the consequences. The heroes are still the Europeans and the Americans because they have a unique character: fight or die for what they believe to be right (inherited from Socrates?) I think that's what we loosely call cultures. Somehthing that hardly change and definitely not in 60 or 70 years and pass down from parents to children unconciously thru a certain ways of upbringing. They are the things that make the Chinese Chinese, the Japanese Japanese, and the Europeans Europeans.
B000001ESP|5.0|MOVING PICTURES, is probably RUSH's finest cd. With the classic Tom Sawyer, the MAd MAx inspired Red Barchetta, YYZ ( which is without a doubt one rock's greatest instrumentals), the haunting Witch Hunt, and the big brother based Camera Eye.  And lets not forget Vital Signs and Limelight.  This cd rocks with out being harsh, and breathed life into a nearly stale rock gene, back in the early 80's.  This is prog-rock at it's best, and this cd showed that Rush was here to stay, and proved once and for all that they were not imitators, but pioneers.

B00005T30L|2.0|I have to say I had high hopes for Ghost World after many successful comic/graphic novel adaptation, but ended up hurt and disappointed.  Don't get me wrong, they picked great actors/actresses, but the story line in the movie seemed to drag.  I think the book reads faster than the pace of the movie.  But I'm just a digruntled comic-geek!!  Check this movie out if you're really bored and are waiting for the Spiderman movie to come out!!
B00005RYKU|3.0|Horror movies can be categorized into two camps:  original and formulatic/predictable.  The former are groundbreaking, such as \\"Psycho\\" or the 1st \\"Nightmare on Elm St.\\"  The latter can best be illustrated by films like \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer.\\"<br />\\"The Glass House\\" falls into the latter category.  But you know what's funny?  After viewing a film that is formulatic/predictable, many movie goers swear up and down that they will never watch such a \\"stupid and predictable\\" movie again.  But...we keep coming back for more of the same.<br />Yes, \\"The Glass House\\" is predictable.  Yes, it becomes almost a parody of what its early scenes tried to be.  However, there were some tense moments created by the director, and some creepy acting by Stellan Skarsgård and Diane Lane.<br />My wife and I had fun watching it because of the infrequent tense moments and the stereotypical script.  However, I wish that amazon.com would incorporate 1/2 star ratings, because this movie was more of a 2 1/2 star flick than a 3 star flick.
B00005JKED|1.0|The only reason this movie even merits 1 star is because I have consistently enjoyed movies featuring Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. Without reservations, I believe Washington should have won major awards for \\"The Hurricane\\" and he should have, garnered nominations, if not awards, for \\"The Bone Collector\\".<br />The major problems with \\"Training Day\\": <BR>(1) Hawke wants to clean the streets of drugs, so of course he is going to smoke or ingest every drug his new boss hands him. The notion of taking drugs at all, let alone the first day on the job, would have been antithetical to the character. However, he smoked and injested as reccomended. Why didn't Hawke just get out of the car and go the hell home?<BR>(2) Upon meeting the demons he was to work with, who threatened him, berated him, pointed weapons at him during the introduction, why would Hawke's character have hung around? He could have gone to work for Tony Soprano; he would have had better pay, a friendlier working environment and a higher odds of survival had he moved to New Jersey.  <BR>(3) I'd sooner swallow \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" than \\"Training Day\\". Even worse, I would compare \\"The Ghosts of Mars\\" as the wide-screen equivelent to \\"60 Minutes\\" before I'd believe \\"Training...'. I like movies that make some sort of sense (even a twisted sense.) <BR>(4) In the fine \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" even white characters characters became lost in a world centered on drugs. This movie out black-ploitation-ed any projects that Richard Roundtree or a young Pam Grier were ever offerred. In addition, redneck Skin-Heads or KKK-ers have further 'Proof' that whites should kill or escort ethnic groups out of the US borders. If there is one thing the world needs, it is the invitation to hate encouraged in \\"Training...\\".<BR>(5) Speaking of over-the-top, the only Oscar winning performance that can even compare to Washington's win-crime is the dreadful Al Pacino's boring, shrill, tiresome \\"Scent of a Woman\\". I guess the Academy thought it owed these guys best actor nods for bringing in the bucks. Washington's character was a departure for him. But the win is also a pat on the back approval by Academy Awarders for violence and for continuation of a stereotype. I love movie violence as much as the next person, however the characters in this movie would stroked out or had heart attacks long before the movie started were they as evil as characterized. \\"Training Day\\" would work better as a video game.<BR>(6) Why did that card-playing scene last so long? As if the viewer needed any further clarification that minorities are violent and hateful and drug ridden and basically, dumb, but street smart. <BR>(7) Departure from characterization will probably be great for Washington's career. However, as the departure was so extreme, I will be a little more guarded about going to see further Washington films. Michael Douglas can play pot-smoking college professors, concerned citizens, or ruthless, unethical power brokers. From this movie, Washington's departure should have been discouraged until better written, stronger co-stars and a more interesting -less stereotypical character was written.<BR>(8) At least during another film I disliked, \\"In the Bedroom\\", I was able to get at least an hour of refreshing sleep. Every time I drifted off in \\"Training Year\\" (oh, sorry; that was only supposed to be a \\"..Day\\" wasnt it?)...the film got really noisy or a snippet of the dreadful dialogued wrenched me from slumber.<...the films of 2001 which were pretty...dare I say it?...LOUSY.

B00005QG9J|5.0|First off I became a huge fan after buying this cd.  I never really listened to Incubus until I heard Wish You Were Here.  I loved that song and I had to go buy it.  I loved this album and bought Science and Make Yourself. Here is what I think: <br />1. Nice To Know You: 9/10 I love the lyrics great song <BR>2. Circles: 7/10 I didn't get into this song at first but then I came around <BR>3. Wish You Were Here: 10/10 Great song Great lyrics great everything this song alone is worth buying the album <br />4.Just A Phase: 8/10 thought it was boring at first but very great song <BR>5.11am:8/10 great lyrics and great singing by Brandon Boyd <BR>6.Blood On The Gound: 9/10 interesting lyrics great song <BR>7.Mexico: 5/10 Least favorite song <BR>8.Warning: 10/10 Their next single great song great lyrics great voice <BR>9.

B00005RFAI|5.0|A Pink fan from the start, I was a bit apprehensive when my friend that she had totally changed. But once I borrowed the CD, I wasn't worried...sure it's very changed since the first album but I like it a lot. \\"Get the Party Started\\" is actually my least favourite on the album...maybe I've heard it on the radio too many times or something but I find myself skipping it. I find the songs at the end of the album a bit more cooler to listen to than the first half. From the first half I like \\"18 Wheeler\\" which is very rocky and catchy after a few listens. The title track is quite good, but don't listen to it to many times...you'll get sick of it...\\"Dear Diary\\" is alrite...\\"Numb\\" is quite catchy...i ABSOULTEY love \\"Like A Pill\\" it's my most fav song on the album...after that \\"Family Portrait is really good as well, though a bit depressing.....the songs between that and \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" i can't remember rite now...DLMGM is good single quality...as everyone says, it's really good and funky...the britney spears rift is very repetitive in your head....track no. 13...Lonely Girl is a close second for my favourite song....the track featuring Linda Perry is soooooo good. The chorus just repeats and repeats in your head...and in a good way....after it \\"Going to California\\" is quite annoying and i quite often skip it. The last song \\"My Vietnam\\" is good album ender and a nice song...I recommand this album
0060930187|5.0|sylvia plath really knew how to put together words to make amazing collections.  this was her only novel, and it is semi-autobiographical.  seeing as she suffered depression, and ended her own life, this is not a happy-go-lucky novel.  but it is real life at her time, and one can really relate to all the emotions felt by the character.  it is very well written, just like her poems.
0790729725|3.0|One of the greatest movies of all time. Unfortunately the disc does not do it justice.<br />I think it's time for WHV to re-release this one. This was one of the first DVD's to be released ever. The Dual-layer disc had not become a reality yet. Today, having to flip the disc seems very 90's. I also think the compression can be improved upon.<br />This is a title worthy of a Special Edition (if they can do it for Kevin Costner's The Postman, I think they can do it for Goodfellas). So hopefully our friends at the WB will work on a re-release real soon. I'll definitely pre-order it as soon as it's announced.
B00005JKED|4.0|The preview for this movie looks kinda like a cheesy action movie, which is why I didn't go and see in the theaters, but I was always wondering about that, since Denzel Washington is in it.  When I heard that he got an Oscar for it I realized I was totally wrong.  This was no cheesy movie, probably one of the most realistic action movies I have in a great while, but without Denzel, or a great ending, this movie would have suffered.<br />Denzel plays a veteran narcotics cop or a \\"NARC,\\"  Who brings Ethan Hawke, a rookie who wants to be a cop in narcotics around for a day, to see if he is worthy of being on Denzel's squad.  From the first time you see Denzel, you know exactly why he got that Oscar, his acting preformance is absolutley spectacular.  And as the movie goes further and further,  Denzel keeps getting more and more suspicious, what kind of cop has wife that lives in the projects?  Then it all leads up to a great ending, which I do not want to give away, for I would entirely ruin the movie for you.  That is what makes the movie so great, Denzel's acting and the great ending, without either of these, this movie would have been totally horrible, it probably would have been that cheesy movie I thought it was.  Oh yeah, Ethan Hawke's preformance ain't half bad either.  <br />So anyways, I suggest you go out and rent this movie, especially if you are looking for another great action movie that has hardly a single cliche.  If you liked movies like the Lethal Weapons or the Die Hards, then this movie is for you.
B00000G3PA|4.0|The third Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer collaboration, Armageddon sees Bruce Willis back in sweaty vest mode<br />in this spectacular sci fi asteroid action fest. And while this does have it's flaws, it's still a cracking high-octane film filled with action and humour. Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi are good make a great supporting cast and add some well-timed humour.<br />The visuals and FX are fantastic and Bay's direction is thankfully lees frenzied than his previous films Bad Boys (1992) and The Rock (1995). Silly and jingoinistic in parts, it's still a great action film as only Bruckheimer could deliver. Enjoy.
B00005U11Z|4.0|Back in the 79's and 80's I was more of a metalhead...Blue Oyster, Ted, Sabbath, Van Halen...and other than \\"Wheel In The Sky\\" could not stand Journey.  Well I'm a little older now and not so wise, but  I really enjoyed this dvd.  The new singer in my opinion is much better than Steve Perry.  His singing is filled with emotion and feeling; ....  Schon's guitar playing is as sharp as ever and the drummer is killer.<BR>This is a must have for any 70's & 80's nostalgia  trip even if you don't remember much of it the first time around...
B00005BJ2O|3.0|My main gripe with this soundtrack has been voiced many times already.  But I will voice it once again: there's stuff missing!  Although an interesting compilation, there are a lot of added songs that don't really need to be there.  For instance, why &quot;Rhythm of the Night&quot; instead of the wonderful &quot;The Pitch&quot;?  Why &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; instead of the hilarious &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;?  And finally, why &quot;Diamond Dogs&quot; by Beck instead of the heartfelt &quot;The Show Must Go on&quot;?  <br />I can understand the fact that there needs to be two CDs, but guess what?  The movie is only two hours.  Two CDs should suffice.  But no, they'll probably release another one.  It's time to get rid of the filler and give us a true soundtrack, not a compilation album of stuff from everyone and every remix under the sun.  <br />My last complaint has nothing to do with songs, but singers.  Poor Nicole has been shunned a few times and it's time to fight back.  Personally, the first time I saw &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; in the theatre, I CRINGED when I heard Ewan McGregor attempt to hit those high notes.  His voice irritated me...a lot.  Nicole's voice on the other hand, I really liked.  I found it to be icy and appropriate.  Although not professional, not bad in the least.<br />Now onto the good.  Believe it or not, there are GOOD things to this soundtrack.  I positively loved &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot;, &quot;Sparkling Diamonds&quot; (heh heh Nicole), &quot;One day I'll Fly Away&quot; (there's that Nicole again), and &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot; (Nicole for the last time).  Baz Luhrmann's really got something here.  There are snippets from the movie in the soundtrack, no doubt, but it's not enough.  Was the soundtrack to &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; a four CD set?  Of course not.  True it was not a musical, but to be fair, it also didn't need EVERY single note that was composed to be in the soundtrack.  Basically, a good (not great when compared to the movie) soundtrack that had lots of filler so we'll buy the next installment(s) in order to get the real stuff.  A clever, if also shameful, marketing ploy.
0440219078|5.0|This book is amazing , the way it writen just pulls you to it. When it leaves you questining something that they said , you will surely find out as you read on.. Though I found the ending kinda disturbing , I really love the whole idea of the book , and the way its writen.. If you want to read something good , then why not pick this book up , if you like something that has to do with a future world , this book is also good for you.
B00003CXXP|1.0|But what about Freddy Got Fingered?  NO!  This is the worst movie of 2001.  Why you ask?  When you set high expectations (early Oscar buzz) about a film and it is so poorly made, so trite, simple, and utterly excruciating to watch, it must not just be set aside as a movie I didn't enjoy, but panned as no movie has ever been panned before.  The watchable and interesting components of this film come in the middle, but they are so clouded by the hyper-exposition ala Bi-Centennial Man (another utterly forgettable robot movie that went on way too long) and the most ridiculous ending of a movie that I've ever had the displeasure of watching, that you forget the important social commentary attempts.  The praise for this movie has been driven mostly by this component.  While there is the beginnings of an interesting social critique, the plotlines and characters (Jude Law) with the most potential don't get enough screen time to save this movie.  <br />Just because something is original or never-been-done before, doesn't make it art, or quality picture making, even if the Speilberg name is attached to it.  <br />If you're looking to fulfill your artistic movie quotient for 2001, skip this two and a half hour waste of time and rent a good, innovative (and the best and most underappreciated movie of 2001) film in Memento...
B00005BJ2O|4.0|When I first heard that there had been a musical made with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, I thought the movie industry had hit a new low. But when I heard my friend's copy of the cd, I found I had been wrong. It had some wonderful music. &quot;Your Song&quot; is one of my top three favorite songs now, and nobody can sing it like Ewan MacGregor. I was most surprised by the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. They can really sing! This is an excellent piece of work.
0345298349|5.0|I've read this book more times than I can count. It possesses an intriguing and complicated plot, extraordinarily well-developed and interesting characters, gives an amazing portrayal of Soviet Moscow, and is exciting and suspenseful. I highly recommend it. Main character Arkady Renko is both brilliant and cynical. He was interesting to read about, and was one of the reasons I liked the book so much. The book has many good elements-love, friendship, death, corruption, greed, suspense, and the violence that comes with the position of Chief Investigator of Moscow, which Renko holds. The KGB is heavily involved, it seems, and Arkady wonders if they are laying a trap for him. (His earlier attempt at arresting Major Pribluda of the KGB for the assassinations of the \\"Kliazma River\\" bodies and his thinly disguised comtempt for the Party and its machinations give them a motive for this action.) The plot has many twists and turns, and by the end of the book, the KGB, Moscow Militia, FBI, and an NYPD officer are all involved, in a complicated and satisfying plot stretching all the way around the world to the U.S. Two other books I have read and enjoyed are \\"The Monkey House\\" and \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\". I also enjoyed other books by John Le Carre (Gorky Park was every bit as good as \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" and as good as le Carre's astounding \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\", though Tinker Tailor was more difficult to understand and required more concentration on my part). In addition, I liked every book I have read by this author, Martin Cruz Smith--Polar Star, Red Square, Havana Bay (all which are in the Gorky Park series) Stallion Gate, and Rose. If you liked any of those books, I'm sure you will like Gorky Park.
B00005QDW1|4.0|This is a pretty good c-d. I love No Doubt and they keep changing and surprising me! I like Return of Saturn and Tragic Kingdom and a few on Beacon Street lots better but this is still a nice c-d. it has tons of jamaican influences and it's funky and really upbeat. It makes me want to dance. I especially like 'hella good' which is a fun partay song, 'in my head' which i listened to over and over again 10 times just a week ago and some others. The c-d has a sort of more annoying pop twist then the others but no doubt still stays true to their unique style, with gwen's tight vocals and all.<BR>Rock on No Doubt!
0671042734|5.0|One of Le Carre's masterpieces, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is much more than a popcorn espionage novel. The characters are vibrant, and the setting is very good. I enjoyed the seemingly bumbling George Smiley, a British ex-spy who's actually sharp as a needle. When the Service thinks it's been pentrated by a Soviet mole, they called in George, whom they fired years ago for a fiasco in Czeckoslovakia. (Smiley's boss had embarked on a small private war there, without authorization or reason, and had caused quite a disruption.) Smiley digs through mounds of files and old briefings by night, searching for the clues that will lead him to the mole. The plot is very well done. My favorite part of Tinker Tailor, however, is the brilliant characterization. I can almost smell the people on the pages. Connie, an eccentric old lady reminscing about her days in British Intelligence (the Circus), an emotional and unfortuate woman who never quite grew up; Peter Guillam, the impatient, embattled and embittered spy who drags Smiley back in to the Circus; Jim Prideaux, the strong-as-an-ox victim of Czeckoslovakia, shot and wounded in the back, the master of the game who hides as a teacher at a boys prep school and charms the students earning himself the honor of a nickname (Rhino); Roach, a fat, athsmatic boy at the prep school who is enchanted with Rhino, loves him and misses him dearly when school lets out, worries about him, and later sees him bury a handgun in the garden, eventually convincing himself that the gun was only a dream. There are scores of others, just as real. The thick plot and wonderful characters of John Le Carre's first Smiley novel make it a delight to read.
B00004XOWM|2.0|When I first heard Limp Bizkit on their debut album \\"Three Dollar Bill Ya'll\\",I instantly fell in love with it. Then in '99 they released \\"Significant Other\\", which I found a bit dull, but still liked it(only for \\"Nokkie\\" and \\"Rearrange\\"). And then came...THIS!! Chocolate Starfist and the Hotdog Flavored Water. Yes, the beats may be good and upbeat but not even the beats save this sorry record. The intro is just a bunch of mindless junk not even worth listening to. \\"Hotdog\\" would be ok if Fred didn't use the \\"f\\" word all the way through it. In fact this record is loaded with foul language. I don't really mind explicit lyrics but this is extreme. \\"My Generation\\" again, is just another rap/rock song pointless and dumb. About the only good tracks are \\"Rollin\\",\\"My Way\\",and \\"Boiler\\". Even their own guitarist said this music was [bad]. Now they've released \\"New Old Songs\\"(should be called \\"Old Songs\\")which is no better than CSATHFW. Take my advice, don't buy neither of these and save a good [money].
0064471837|5.0|I think Sabriel is one of the best Fantasy books I've ever read! I couldnt put it down! I love to read fantasy and this captures all of it! It has action, romance, mystery,comedy, danger! I recommend this book to dedicated fantasy readers young and old alike (well maybe not that young!) But be warned...If ya read this one ya gotta read Lirael (the sequel) and Abhorsen which has not been published yet (arrgh) But its worth the wait!!
B00005YUR1|5.0|This was the first movie I ever saw with Nicolas Cage i it and I fell in love.  The movie is great.  I love stories about people goign back in time.  This movie is a wonderful to say several young acters and actresses in what is probably some of their first films.
B000002RAA|5.0|When I try to get my friends into Hawkwind, I usually<br />start them out with this album, for it really is a good intro-<br />duction to them. Hawkwind got a tad more musical on HALL, due in<br />part to the arrival of violinist/keyboardist SIMON HOUSE, and<br />HALL also was their first progressive rock album. I don't like<br />every song on this, but I still think it's a very powerful album.<br />YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT has a very memorable vocal line to it; the chorus,<br />which has LEMMY singing the song title, is one of their best<br />choruses ever. Tis a very heavy song, with an extended instru-<br />mental break during which the soloists go nuts! The title track<br />is a very spacy, but melodic instrumental and is quite lovely,<br />actually. WIND OF CHANGE saw the first appearance of a mellotron<br />in a HAWKWIND song.LOST JOHNNY is one of LEMMY's best songs.<br />It's very spooky sounding, with it's dark lyrics and sythesizers<br />and is really a very enjoyable hard rock song. DEL DETTMAR con-<br />tributes a very nice, soothing instrumental. YOU BETTER, PSYCHE-<br />LEDIC WARLORDS and PARADOX showed that HAWKWIND hadn't complete-<br />ly abandoned their hard rock side. HALL is a terrific HAWKWIND<br />album!
B00005NKKY|5.0|Bookends is a case in study of just how far pop music can go. Artists such as Bob Dylan and other early revolutionary folkies had been touting the virtues of social recognition in popular music for half a decade by this time, but only recently had artists such as The Beatles began slipping such messages subtly into highly accessible pop songs. Bookends is the culmination of this idea. 1968 was a turbulent time in America, and this album captures it almost as well as you could ask in its context. Sordid social observations and bits of everyday life are dipped like a cautious toe reaching into the rich waters of these folk/pop masterpieces. The first half of the album is the interlaced Bookends suite (beginning and ending with the theme), and the second half consists of a series of excellent individual songs. The gentle, lifting acoustic guitar of the opening theme gives way to a rudely brusque synthesizer at the start of Save The Life of My Child, which then goes into America, still one of the greatest pop songs ever recorded (and later turned into an unbelievable 10 and a half minute epic by prog-rockers Yes.) The rest of the suite is as poignant. Of the individual tracks, they are all uniformly excellent. Fakin' It does about as well as one could possibly imagine at conveying the feeling of hopelessness in a pop context, as does A Hazy Shade of Winter and the pseudo-Orwellian At The Zoo. Mrs. Robinson ranks right up there with America (and also shares its paranoiac imagery) as one of the greatest pop songs of the 60's. This was a very ambitious album for Simon & Garfunkel to undertake. It is here that they began to branch out of their acoustic folk box, and began integrating delicate social messages into their songs to the fullest extent. Quite simply, a masterpiece and a must-own.
0792842499|5.0|If there is one movie you must own, this is it! This is Clint Eastwood at its best. I do not usually like Westerns, but this is not about Western, it is about a genuine fantasy that takes you away from all your real world problems! If you are depressed over your stock losses, or having marriage and/or work, etc., problems, watching this movie will relax you and takes you away from it all. A truly enjoyable movie experience. <br />What Bethoven's Fur Elise is to the music world, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly is to the movie world.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This movie tells you a mysterious adventure of two women in Hollywood, a search of one woman's lost memory that discovers the real nightmare of another woman who first comes to LA and dreams to be a movie star. I think it is hardly to summary this movie to other viewers by describing the story of it, see, that maybe the greatest point of the movie, you have to see and be more concentrate on it.<BR>Personally, I guess what Lynch tries to express is a virtual and vituperative utterance on what the life of Hollywood is. Lynch insists on his style of making the thrill movie, which created another cinematic masterpiece among his works. Like Hitchcock's classic thrills, this one expertly grasps the audiences from the beginning to the end.
B00005JKBC|1.0|If you have a Toshiba DVD player beware, because on many models (including Mitsubishi derivatives) it is IMPOSSIBLE to turn off the subtitles for the hearing impaired for more than a couple minutes at a time.  It very difficult to watch the movie with these subtitles popping up all the time.  You can also try contacting Universal as they may (should!) soon come up with a fix or a re-release.  If you have to own this movie RENT IT first to make sure it works.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This is the first Beatles cd i've ever bought or listened to, and I think it's great! It was a great introduction to their music, and I plan to buy more albums. I wasn't around back in the 60's and 70's (I'm 13), and at first I was skeptical because I wasn't used to it, but now I'm a big fan. The sound quality wasn't amazing, but I'm not too picky about that. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is a first-time fan and wants to see what their music is like.

0312243022|4.0|In 1925, Virginia Woolf published her masterful novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". Set during a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, Woolf brilliantly used techniques which became hallmarks of the modern novel--interior monologue, first person narrative and a stunning, albeit unrelentingly difficult, stream-of-consciousness rendering--to produce one of the masterpieces of twentieth century English literature. Nearly seventy-five years later, Michael Cunningham has used many of these same techniques to write \\"The Hours\\", a fitting homage to Woolf and a novel which deservedly won both the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize.<br />\\"The Hours\\" tells the story of a bright June day in the lives of three different women living in three different times and places. The first story is that of Virginia Woolf during a day in 1923, when she is writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". The second is the story of Laura Brown, a thirtyish, bookish married woman living in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Laura has a four-year-old son and is pregnant with another child as she plans a birthday dinner for her husband on a day in 1949. The third story is that of Clarissa Vaughn, a fifty-two year old, slightly bohemian, literary agent who is planning a party for Richard, her long-time friend and one-time lover, a prominent writer dying of AIDS.<br />\\"The Hours\\" is, among other things, a nuanced and sensitive picture of middle age in the lives of its characters. Like the novel to which it pays tribute, \\"The Hours\\" relies heavily on interior monologue-on thoughts, memories and perceptions-to drive the narrative and to establish a powerful bond between the reader and each of the female protagonists. The reader feels the psychic pain of the aging Virginia Woolf as she contemplates suicide in the Prologue. The reader has an almost tactile sense of Laura Brown's claustrophobia, of her feeling that life is closing in around her, as she flees to a hotel for two hours in the middle of the day simply to spend time reading (\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", of course). And the reader can identify with the yearning, the melancholy, that is suggested when Clarissa Vaughn thinks back to the time when she was young, when her life's choices had not yet been made. <br />\\"The Hours\\" is written, in short, like all great fiction--with deep feeling and love for its characters-and it stands as one of the outstanding American novels of the past decade. While resonating with the themes, techniques and characters of Woolf's difficult modern masterpiece, \\"The Hours\\" is masterful and original in its own right, an accessible and engaging work that is worth all the time you spend with it.
B000005Z0E|3.0|was a good album.  ...  i thought it was very underrated and should of sold more copies (500,000+).  had a lot of old school beats.  favorite songs were part time mutha, i dont give a ..., and violent.  was a different 2pac then the thugged out death row 2pac.  i liked the thugged out 2pac better but this was still good.  a good debut album. <BR>                    by 2pacs #1 fan.
0375707972|3.0|In the late 1950s, Michael Berg, a fifteen year old German schoolboy, meets and falls in love with an enigmatic working-class woman more than twice his age, thirty-six year old Hanna Schmitz. Thus begins Bernhard Schlink's short, sparely written novel, \\"The Reader\\". From there, the plot of this best-selling novel is well known. Berg spends many days with Hanna, reading to her and making love, the mysterious woman becoming the obsession and fulfillment of erotic desire. Then, Hanna suddenly disappears, leaving Berg's life as quickly and mysteriously as she had entered it. Several years later, in the mid-1960s, Berg once again encounters Hanna, this time standing trial for war crimes as a former guard at Auschwitz. His obsession rekindled, Berg's narrative follows Hanna's trial, disclosing her wartime crimes and her \\"secret\\", and relating the austere relationship which continued between them during Hanna's years of imprisonment.<br />\\"The Reader\\" is a little novel that has big aspirations, its austere prose and simple plot suggesting to the reader that there is something more, something unsaid, about the engimatic Hanna. Unfortunately, Hanna's ultimate \\"secret\\"-her illiteracy-does not bear the weight of Schlink's story, does not adequately explain Hanna's actions. It may become a wonderful television movie, but \\"The Reader\\" is not the classic work that, for example, George Steiner's profuse praise suggests. While the first part of the novel, a little erotic fairy tale of the affair between Berg and Hanna, is a concentrated work of spare, lucid prose which \\"hooks\\" the reader, the remainder of the book is not nearly so good and never carries the weight of the big questions Schlink wants to raise-questions of guilt and love and the relationship between generations in post-War Germany.<br />It is certainly worth spending a few short hours with \\"The Reader\\", an interesting, if not profound, novel with some very good writing. Just don't expect a modern classic.
B000005Z0G|3.0|s4mn was ok.  i thought 2pacalypse now was better.  some of the songs i thought were kind of whack like 5 deadly venomz and strugglin.  some of the songs i thought were great.  he had deep song like keep ya head up, papa'z song, and even though it wasnt a song i really liked something 2 die 4.  he had songs that i really liked like holla if ya hear me, last wordz, and my favorite strictly 4 my niggaz.  i thought i get around was overrated.  overall it was a good 2pac album.<BR>                    by 2pacs #1 fan
B000060MY6|4.0|Laura Harring is a woman who suffers from amnesia and Naomi Watts is the aspiring actress who tries to help her find her memories.  The first two hours of Mulholland Drive is some of the best mystery/noir filmmaking ever, with two fantastic lead performances from the beautiful Harring and Watts (and an incredibly steamy and sexy love scene between the two) before unravelling into incoherent, \\"existential\\" babble in the last half-hour, obviously tacked on by director David Lynch, who couldn't figure out a logical way to end an otherwise logical film.  Still, just for the 4/5's of the running time, this is highly recommended.
B00005AQE8|5.0|fresh outta jail 2pac was mad as hell he took it out on all eyez on me.  no one was ready for this album.  this album was straight up hardcore.  starts out with ambitionz az a ridah with one of the tightest beats ever letting everyone know hes ready for war.  all about u, skandolouz, and how do u want it showed 2pacs [other] side.  2pac also returned to his softer side shouting out to all his homies that died on life goes on.  only god can judge me was real.  i really liked tradin war stories.  california love was tight as hell but i liked the original better.  my favorite song on there is no more pain.  that song has the tightest beat you will ever hear.  when im mad as hell at somebody and wanna beat them up i listen to no more pain and think about beating them down.  when 2pac got out of jail there were a lot of people that wanted to kill him and there were the people who tried to kill him.  no more pain is dedicated to those punk a** b****** letting them know im killing all yall.  after i finished disc 1 i was addicted.  i loved it so much.  then i thought theres still one more disc.  right away i got started on disc 2.  was tight as hell but not as good as 1.  the only song i hated on disc 2 was thug passion i couldnt stand that song.  that was the only bad song on the whole album.  first 5 songs on disc 2 were amazing.  starts out with cant c me with a hard beat and like no more pain telling those punk[s] they cant c him.  shorty wanna be a thug was tight.  one of my favorite 2pac songs ever is holla at me.  2pac dedicates it to biggie and his rhymes are unbelievable.  i love that song.  a song that should have been on greatest hits was wonda why they call u...  that song was deep and had meaning.  letting c. delores tucker know that theres women and theres...not just one.  next song 2pac introduced everyone to the outlawz.  this is also one of my favorite 2pac songs.  usually when i hear a 2pac song with the outlawz in it i just listen to pacs part.  not on this one the outlawz did great and flowed nicely.  i thought 2pacs part was the best though. it was another hard song on all eyez on me.  picture me rollin was a real good song.  i liked how 2pac flowed on it.  another song that i really liked was rather be ya...  it had a tight chorus and 2pac rapped good on there with richie rich.  another song i liked was aint hard to find.  it questions if 2pacs alive.  2pac saying \\"i heard rumor i died murdered in cold blood dramatized, pictures of me in my final stage you know mama cried.  but that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted, like i no longer existed mysteriously missing\\".  he also says \\"you tried to play me now homicides my only payment.\\"  is he talking about biggie?  overall this album proved to the world that 2pac can rap.  without this album 2pac wouldnt have been as popular.  ill never get tired of this album.  but this was not the real 2pac that you hear on his other albums.  this was just the hardcore deathrow 2pac.  it doesnt matter if you like 2pac or not, buy this album.  and most of the people who didnt like him loved him when they heard this...
B00005JKJA|5.0|I enjoy David Lynch movies.  Mulholland Dr is no exception.  It gets better with each viewing.  I'm commenting on the lack of any chapter stops.  The DVD for \\"The Straight Story\\" that David Lynch directed has a remark inside from the man himself: \\"I know that most DVDs have chapter stops.  It is my opinion that a film is not like a book - it should not be broken up.  It is a continuum and should be seen as such.  Thank you for your understanding.\\"  I don't think the lack of chapter stops makes it a cheap or bad DVD, it is just the way David Lynch wants it.  The DVD of his film \\"The Elephant Man\\" also is without chapter stops.
B00004Z459|5.0|While I read through these reviews, I keep running into 'This is alright...  Listen to it if you like KoRn, and it's way better than Bizkit'...  In my opinion, while KoRn is a brilliant band and there is much talent within it, Linkin Park does a better job of fusing things together, and has produced an album of unparralelled quality in the genre.<br />The music is, while harsh at points, well orchestrated and pleasing to the ear, Joe Hahn's work on the turntables is amazing (And it is him you have to thank for the beautiful 'piano' introduction to 'In the End'), Mike Shinoda prooves himself to be a 'rapper' of unique candor and delivery; and his singing's not too bad either.<br />Which brings me to Chester Bennington.  Even if the music were mediocre, his lyrics and breathtaking voice would be well worth the album.  And anyone who is tempted to dismiss him as 'The guy who screams' should go out and download the track 'My December' (woefully unavailable in most of the US for some unfathomable reason).<br />All in all, it is a skillfully executed record, even more remarkable for a first effort, and more than work the money to buy it.
B00005JKQX|5.0|This movie, as a movie, is wonderful. It has a beautiful storyline, amazingly good actors, and a gorgeous score.<br />But, as an adaptation of a book, it is not so good. I read \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" this week, and was amazed FAR more by the book, than by the movie, and it disappointed me to realize how much the movie strays from the book. I can understand adaptations like \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", where a few things are changed, and a chapter left out, but in \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" (the book), there wasn't even MENTION of John Forbes Nash, Jr. seeing a government man, a room mate, or a room mate's niece during his schizophrenic years. Rather, he wanted to establish a \\"World Government\\", and spent months in Europe trying to renounce his American citizenship and be legally considered a refugee from \\"'all NATO, Warsaw, Middle East and SEATO pact countries.'\\" -(\\"A Beautiful Mind\\", \\"Citoyen du Monde\\", page 273, Sylvia Nasar)<br />The movie neglected to point out Nash's struggles with homosexuality, AND with Alicia, whom he divorced and didn't remarry until June of 2001. Nash didn't only have one son, either; he had an affair BEFORE meeting Alicia, and the son he had with Alicia is now, as I write this, suffering from schizophrenia himself, just as his father did. And, near the end of the book, it speaks much of the daily struggle it is for John and Alicia with John's son, John Charles Nash, because of his constant \\"remissions\\", and then relapses into schizophrenic hallucinations. I'd hardly call that a completely happy ending; much less happy than the movie made it out to be, anyway.<br />BUT, AS A MOVIE, like I said earlier, minus ALL the strayings from the book, \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" is beautiful itself. Russell Crowe is convincing as hell, and deserved the Oscar he didn't get, even if he won for \\"Gladiator\\" last year. And Jennifer Connelly... <<sigh>>... is as good as an actress as ever, and deserves the Oscar she got.<br />And the movie, as a whole, deserved the Oscar it got for Best Picture, because, as far as I can tell, it WAS the best picture of 2001.
630575067X|1.0|The movie was basically [bad]. Some nice visuals, Darth Maul was pretty cool, but it had SO MANY flaws in character development, credibility, and plot that it's essenially a very annoying movie with some good effects. It's not just a case of 'my expectations were so high and of course it couldn't live up to the blah blah...' This is just a BADLY written and directed film. <br />The 1 star I do give it is for the making-of part of the DVD which was interesting.
B000002PC6|5.0|I still remember the day I bought this LP, rushing back to my dorm to listen to it, and immediately knowing it was destined to become ONJ's biggest seller (after \\"Grease.\\")  As much as I adore her other back catalog - who can resist \\"The Rumour\\" or \\"Let Me Be There?\\" or \\"Gaia\\" - \\"Physical\\" offered us a fresh sound that was perfectly in tune with the times.  The title track, as everyone knows, became an anthem for exercise, and most recently was named the best workout song of all time by VH1.  It shot to number one in just 4 weeks and stayed there for ten weeks in total, making it the Number One song of the Eighties, and still ranking in the top 20 songs of the rock and roll era.  It's a fitting tribute to the pop goddess of the 70s and 80s that she single-handedly started a workout revolution, not to mention more than a few fashion trends.  After the unparalleled success of \\"Grease\\" this collection offered exactly the right mix of moods, beats and glowing production, earning ONJ multiple Grammy nominations as well as the first ever Grammy for best short form video.  <br />But the pleasures of the album do not stop with the legendary song itself - there are gems here right and left.  \\"Stranger's Touch\\" is a searing number that rocks, while \\"Landslide\\" is one of her finest cuts to date - a pulse-quickening percolating number that deserved far greater attention.  Also included is the top 5 hit \\"Make a Move On Me\\" and the passionate \\"Promise\\" which showcased the artists talent as a songwriter and lyricist.  <br />If you're interested in adding ONJ's ESSENTIAL albums to your collection, start with \\"Physical\\" and then follow up with \\"Rumour\\", \\"Gaia\\", \\"Clearly Love\\", the Grease soundtrack.  A terrific set from an incredible talent!
B00005BF9Z|5.0|...I would recomend it to anyone with a flare for exotic music. It's style is so unique yet so European. I can just imagine the songs that Manu Chao sings hitting Manhattan's local clubs. You have to buy this cd...it's just so up tempo and it makes you want to get up and get your grove thing going. By the way the song I was describeing before is called 'Me Gustas Tu'...it's on Manu Chao's 'Proxima Estacin: Esperanza' album so you just got to get it!! 5 starts!!!

B000060OWV|4.0|The enigmatic Robben Ford hits pay dirt here..  I hesitate to call this a come-back album, but the last three or four albums Fod has put out have been unfocused, and sketchy.  In contrast, Blue Moon sounds like it knows where it's going.  I'd add a half a star here if I could.<br />Some of the hightlights:<br />Robben sings a lot more loosely and confidently then he has in the past.  One gets the sense that he's having fun..<br />The guitar playing is not regulated to the back room.   He does judicious time playing the hell out of his Telecaster and his Gibson scaled guitars.  But the virtuosity does the music well, and there is a wonderful balance between the blues and just going out.  His solos sing, and cry, and come to a wonderful point.  Listen to the solo on &quot;You're going to be sorry.&quot;  Great job from a really great player.<br />He gets gooooooood backup, from the various combination of side men and backup vocalists.  Some wonderful, subtle B3 and sax playing on this album.  Again, think loose but funky.<br />One other thing.  This album sounds great CRANKED.  Turn it up.
0446310786|5.0|This is my favorite book. My uncle bought it for me when I was twelve, and at the time I thought, okay, I'll read it . . . one day. A couple months later I finally picked it up, and couldn't put it down. <BR>To Kill a Mockingbird is a profound novel because it deals with a topic no one can understand (racism) but tells it in a language everybody can understand (the narrator is a little girl named Scout). Scout's view of the world at the beginning of the novel is like that of any other child: innocent. You know, the lies we all used to believe, that everybody on earth is nice and kind and that we all love each other, etc., etc. But then Scout, her brother Jem, and her friend Dill (who is based on Harper Lee's childhood friend, Truman Capote) are compelled to face reality all of a sudden when their father defends a black man on trial for rape. The children learn the hard truths of life, that this world isn't always a pleasant place after all. <BR>But what is so extraordinary about Scout is that she never speaks with hate. She speaks with a child's innocence, and describes complex things in a child's way, which makes it easier to understand. I don't think this book would have been the same if Atticus had told the story, or if this had been told in third-person point of view. Then it would have lacked its young narrator's frankness. <BR>There aren't enough words to describe To Kill a Mockingbird. This is by far the best book I have ever read, and perhaps the greatest contribution an American writer has made to the literary world. To put it simply, this book should be read by everyone. If we all looked at this world as Scout does in this book, maybe this world would be a better place.
6303347657|3.0|This is just a movie to laugh at and have a good time with. And there are so many people who say The Mask is just too harsh and violent and the one that really made me laugh was some say that it is too scary? The best parts of course are when he is wearing the mask. As for the plot it is pretty bad when you look at it but I think everybody knows that. The violence for this movie is funny and even little kids can watch this. For crying out loud they even made a action figure of the mask years ago. The Mask is an original entertaining light comedy.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Do not be fooled by the one star rating.  That is just the rating for the lackluster packaging of the dvd.  The film itself is an engrossing, atmospheric movie that will seduce and absorb you inside the world Hollywood's resident provocateur, David Lynch, has created.  As much as the film doesn't make sense with it's narrative, it is the moody atmospherics and pacing of the film that will consistently garner your attention.  I never even realized the film was a 140 minute film until I bought the DVD.  In the theaters, the movie seemed to zip right past by without me noticing.  No matter what your taste in movies, I assure you this is most definitely a movie for everyone (albeit the under 15 demographic)  One thing that is for sure is that the movie is a roaming dream within a nightmare.  Although I'm still not sure which character is dreaming about his/her nightmare, but the dream within a dream concept is clearly established with the opening shot of the extreme close-ups of the bedsheets and a medium shot of Rita, falling asleep under the dining table in Betty's Aunt's apartment.  This is followed by a zoom in shot of the camera going inside the mysterious blue box towards the middle of the film, begining a new storyline.
B00005QATY|2.0|O Brother Where Art Thou is one of those movies where alot like it and alot of people hate it. I am one who really did not like the movie. The plot did not pick up and little action occured and the parts got confusing. The scenery was really nice looking though but it was too long and boring and being in a room with 12 other people while this was on nobody laughed once. It just one those movies where it's music is really bad and the movie is bad too and it gets so many rave reviews and you just do not understand why.

What this movie si about, I haven't got a clue, but it sure is one hell of trip.  The only thing I am certain of, is that this film is a dream within a dream among two characters.  I say this because the shot after the begining collage of swing dancers, is that of a handheld camera with a roaming POV shot of a character falling asleep on the bed.  Soon afterwards when Rita hides under the dining table during the begining, she falls asleep and I think that is when the dream within a nightmare storyline begins.  This sort of thing also transpires towards the half-way mark of the film where the camera zooms inside the mysterious blue box once it is opened.

B00005QXXO|3.0|I, like many millions, feel that Radiohead is the one bright light in the sea of uncreative music that we are currently drifting in. This was my first exposure to selections from Kid A and Amnesiac. I understand the challenge of following up a masterpiece like OK Computer. It's better not to even attempt to equal such brilliance. Radiohead made the right move, do something so different it can't be compared to the last recording. This live recording starts off with some pretty uninteresting stuff. There is nothing about National Anthem that has any merit to it. I Might Be Wrong is another attempt to fill alot of space with very little content. The trick of quick ending songs for drama is pretty lame and doesn't make the songs any better. I appreciate the inventiveness of Everything In It's Right Place and Dollars And Cents is actually the best song of the whole bunch. The idea of creating a more sonic experience with their music is a worthwhile endeavor but I think the boys need to try a little harder next time. Using very basic song structure to shape an interesting sound around can often produce some great music but it can also be Very Boring. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.

B00005NRNB|5.0|I'd like to start off by saying that I haven't watched Air Force One in several years, so I've forgotten whata great film this actually is.  I have had the VHS Widescreen version since 1998, but I've only watched it once since then.  But fast forward to 2002 and now its on Superbit DVD.  All I have to say is WOW!  The picture and sound will blow you away.  The sound especially if you have a 5.1 surround system.  The gun fire is especially intense and well spaced in the the sound field.  One of the most jaw-dropping scenes is the F-15/MiG-29 engagement at the end.  Another is when Air Force One crashes into the Ocean.  WOW!  What a crash scene!<br />But another thing I'd like to point out is that it's strange now that all these films that have to do with terrorists have an all new meaning and message now in our post-9/11 world.  If you'll recall, Oldman's character was a Russian nationalist who wanted a re-united Russian motherland with the President (played by Jurgen Prochnow, of Das Boot fame) of Kazakstan as the Russian Prime Minister.  Except that he's a renegade that wants to use the old Russian nuclear stockpile to terrorize the free world.  Oldman states how US foreign policy may be beneficial to the US, but it destroys the lives of other countries.  I think he mentions something about the sanctions on Iraq causing undue suffering.  So you see, these old terrorist movies should have been a bit of a wake-up call for us.<br />So in closing, if you're looking for a good terrorist thriller in this post-9/11 world, look no further than Air Force One on Superbit.
0671688782|5.0|We used 'holding time' for those times when our older daughter went completely out of control: hitting us, spitting, trashing her room, won't stay in timeout, etc. It was very successful for us. So successful, that we almost never use it now. My wife and I found Holding Time complementary to Rosemond's 'Making the 'Terrible' Twos Terrific.' Ignore the author's insistence that the technique only works for mothers. It works with fathers, too!
B00000IQC8|5.0|Awesome!  This flick will grab your attention and make you ask why from the very first scene when head man Dante Hicks rolls out of his closet in the morning.  This movie about our comsumer based and driven lives will make you laugh out loud with all of it's crazy antics and great humor.  After seeing this movie with my friends we can't help but laugh at certian things we see and hear everyday.  The number 37 will always be seen as a reason to just start laughing.  If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. :-)  This is a movie that I own 3 copies of because I had to have one for home and one to take to school, and then is hit DVD and made everything better with all the X-tra stuff in it.  You will enjoy this movie.  And you will laugh, and when you've seen it more than 5 times you'll laugh at all the things before they happen and your friends will look at like you like you're some kind of hysterical fool, but it's all worth it.

B000002H6C|4.0|After the incident with Cliff Burton former bassist, they recruited solid bassist Jason Newsted who in my opinion as a percussionist myself matches CLiff Burton up to the bitter end, even for a pick player.  However Hetfield and Lars have never been too fond of Jason, they needed a bass player just to get on stage, do his job to make them look good, and get his check at the end of the month.  Which can all be good for awhile, but not for long at all.  This is one main reason why Newsted left was because they would never let him hardly write his own material, or even get to have people listen to his killer bass riffs throughout the whole songs.  Thats one reason why metallica would always have bass solos live, so that their bassists could get a moment of enjoyment with playing. Metallica never did have good bass recordings throughout their entire songs, especially live.  I have a killer sound system and cranked the bass up to full throttle, the only bass in there is Lars's double bass, which is ok and all, but its missing the bass guitar as well.  Still minus the bass, there are some very good songs on here.<br />Blackened-Nice intro, odd lyrics about the end of the world having to do with evolution. Hetfield gives a nice touch with his vocals.<br />An Justice for all..-Excellent opening, excellent political lyrics, and a nice solo by Hammet.<br />Eye of the Beholder-Excellent name for a song, but I cant get into this song at all.  Its too slow and way too repeative. The chorus is catchy though. <br />One-Of course a great song, lyrics are a bit awkward but it is still deep.  Hetfield is playing the opening bass on here with his guitar, while Jason should be doing it himself.  It wouldve sounded so much better. Talent wise, this is Kirk's best guitar solo off the album, and lars does nail the drums nicely.<br />The shortest Straw-fast paced song, interesting lyrics.  A fun headbanging tune to listen too.<br />Harvester of Sorrow-Excellent,heavily distorted song, however when the touch of melody comes in place, hetfield is playing the bass again with his guitar, that should be another spot for Jason. Dull lyrics, but killer chorus. (Anger, misery<BR>, you'll suffer unto me?) <BR>Frayed ends of sanity-nice song about a schizo, fast and heavy.  The opening intro of the chanting which originally took place in the wizard of oz movie is hilarious.<br />To live is to die-My opinion, this is the best song off here. The spanish guitar flows nicely for an intro and an outro.  The mid melody is simply outstanding, nice distortion from Hetfield, still no bass guitar added.  Yet it is still an awesome song, I hope to cover this song, and add some more bass work on it.<br />Dyer's Eve-Angry, aggressive song.  Hetfield screams his lungs out, and you can almost feel his pain for these lyrics about ungreatful parents.  Hammet delivers another nice solo to close this album off.<br />After this album, I couldnt ever get back into metallica, it did have its moments I guess in the 90's and now, but still doesnt cut it for me. This album is really good though, its a very easy album really, not complex at all.  If it had better bass work on it, I wouldve given it five stars, and no it did not have any good bass work on it at all, really listen to it and see for yourself, its true. Lars delivers the goods, hetfield's vocals improved on this album and does a fine job with the rythm guitar.Hammet is a pretty good guitarist, he is no god of guitar, but he is good.  Even though metallica are better then these talentless nu-metal bs bands today, they still are for these bands, and still support them, just so they can stay commercial.  So all in all, they betrayed the metal scene, just like Ozzy did, see the ozzfest yourself now days.  Still this is when Metallica was in their prime.  Get this album if you love metal.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is a awesome band.  I listen to them in my spare time, when I'm on the computer and whenever I steal my sisters Hybrid Theory.  This CD has a lot of great songs on it, including my favorite, Papercut.  I recommend this CD to anyone who at all likes Linkin Park.
B00005RYQO|5.0|\\"The Fast and the Furious\\" (2001)<br />After the disappointing Driven, in 2001 we really needed a movie with awesome cars and awesome girls to perk up our screens with the driving theme. The Fast and the Furious was not a movie I was looking forward to watching, but it surprised me with its ability to entertain me like no other car movie before it. This is a stylish, amazingly shot, witty, man's movie that set new heights for future great racing flicks.<br />Okay, so the movie doesn't exactly have the most amazing story. The characters aren't really 3-dimensional and most of the plot is taken from Point Break (which I have yet to see). What really made me love The Fast and the Furious is the fact that I was never bored, sighing or rolling my eyes. I was never shifting my [behind] around on the seat, never twindling my fingers on the seat in front of me, nothing like that at all. I was involved in this movie, because, however undeveloped the characters are, this is a movie proud of what it is - a movie strictly for entertainment value. It was loud, had the most awesome cars you will ever see in 2001 and had lots of cool actors that suit their characters. The Fast and the Furious made me get in the car, take a little ride and I definitely had to make sure I'd hold on.<br />This movie is all neat and stylie, with kinetic energy and the best races I've ever seen on-screen. I was also surprised at how well the movie was made, the editing was very tight, the cinematography stunning and surprising (nominated for an AFI this year), the colours flashy and the presentation exuberant. And to boot, the undercover cop idea was done to the best it could, considering how the director had to focus on the cars more than a brilliant story, because this movie is mostly aimed at teenagers and youngsters who love the noise and the cars. That doesn't mean to say that anybody can't enjoy The Fast and the Furious, because it is pretty hard not to like this film!<br />The actors, as I saidbefore, are rough and tough and suit their characters well. Paul Walker (also seen in Joy Ride this year) was charming enough and a believable cop. Michelle Rodriguez was particularly sexy for the girls side and is taking a tough-chick perspective - she also made her debut in Girlfight. Lets see what else you can do, Michelle, because girl, you got talent. Jordana Brewster is beautiful and looks great with every movement she makes - she's not a Judi Dench, but that's definitely not what the movie is asking of her! None of the lead characters, male or female, can top Vin Diesel's classic as Dom, the deep-voiced, strong, action-man of a hero - or not? Another good thing about the movie - the characters constantly change positions, and it made them 2-D. Good enough for me, especially in a racing film!<br />Some corny lines sometimes overrun the furious style of the movie, but it is still a fantastic, unpredictable, masterfully constructed piece of film. I enjoyed every minute, this is a never-dull, loud, action-packed flick that's on fire with audience praise and has the most exhilarating chase sequences of the year. One of my 2001 favourites!<br />MY GRADE: A-
0789723107|5.0|This book walks it's talk. It is written and arranged exactly as a useable web site should be, clear and concise, with scannable (as well as enjoyable) text. The clean attractive design and graphics accurately and efficiently illustrate the text, which is easy to read and to understand. I love the use of cartoon people with thought balloons to suggest how people think while using a web site.<br />There is no clutter of technical gibberish or endless verbose rambling on statistics. The chapter on usability testing takes us step by step through the process and is descriptive and instructional instead of theoretical. Steve Krug doesn't feel he has to sacrifice creativity, visual interest, individuality, or effective advertising in order to develop a usable web site. \\"Good tag lines are personable, lively, and sometimes clever. Clever is good, but only if the cleverness helps convey - not obscure - the message.\\" <br />I can't agree with those who dismiss this book as nothing but common sense. While I see nothing wrong with publishing a reference and instructional manual that is full of common sense, this book also presents the reasoning behind every method that is suggested. The clashes between designers, programmers, and advertisers are explored and addressed. While I agree that the simple and obvious conclusion is that the focus should be on the user, it is refreshing and helpful to find a book which distills information from all of the varied and opposing developer viewpoints, and applies to them to that end. The book is, after all, subtitled \\"A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability.\\" Also, like most common sense, it isn't really so obvious until after someone has pointed it out to you.<br />Here are a few things you won't find in this book, which makes it all the more effective and convincing. You won't find anything that claims this is the \\"right\\" way to design web sites. There will be no discussion of business models or predictions for the future of the web. Thebest omission of all is that there is no bad mouthing of poorly designed sites. According to Steve Krug \\"Designing, building, and maintaining a great web site isn't easy. It's like golf: a handful of ways to get the ball in the hole, a million ways not to. Anyone who gets it half right has my admiration.\\" <br />This book gets it more than half right.
B00005T343|5.0|\\"Hannibal\\" (2001)<br />Finally, after the long wait, the much-anticipated sequel to one of the best films of the 1990's, The Silence of the Lambs, has arrived. We have waited 10 years for this movie, and now that it's released, many viewers and critics disliked it. In my opinion, the gruesome Hannibal was worth the wait.<br />The critics and viewers disliked it because it wasn't Silence of the Lambs-ish enough. Because it didn't have the intelligence or story that The Silence of the Lambs had. Hello, it's a different movie! Sure, some characters return and it's a sequel, but this movie isn't the crime drama that The Silence of the Lambs was. Ridley Scott's goal with Hannibal was to make a gruesome and gory romantic horror film, and in my books, he has certainly succeeded.<br />Many say the movie is boring at the start because \\"all Clarice does is look at a computer and study Hannibal Lecter.\\" Again, I have an argument against that statement. Clarice is developed a lot in the first half of the film. Her character is different now; she's stronger, more feisty, and she is now a full FBI agent. The way she moves and talks to people in the starting half brings Clarice's character into a whole new light, and I really liked that perspective. In The Silence of the Lambs, we knew a lot about Clarice and her past and her pains. With Hannibal, we get to learn more about her attitude and the way she sees life. I loved seeing the first half get off to a start which enables us to see different sides of the characters. Despite the title being Hannibal, this movie was way more about Clarice.  And the part about her just looking at computers and searching for Hannibal? Well, if you were haunted by endless dreams about the most terrifying cannibal in the world, I think you'd want to track him down and try to catch him, don't you? She isn't just looking at computer screens; she's thickening the plot. <br />Hannibal Lecter is way scarier, more vicious and more exciting in the sequel. He is now walking freely in Florence. Hannibal is funnier in this movie. When he starts to go on a murder spree, he sort of jokes about the death that is upon his victims. This isn't supposed to be funny, but I root for Hannibal and his series, and in this movie, Anthony Hopkins brings Lecter to life in such a classic cool style that's it's almost impossible not to be drawn into the wild antics of our favourite movie villain. One weird thing about him in this movie is that - spoiler area - he doesn't eat any of his victims, either that or we don't see him crunching and munching. Hannibal is displayed as more of a serial killer in this movie than a cannibal, which disappointed me somewhat. Never mind though, Hopkins makes the character interesting enough once again to stop us from moaning.<br />Ridley Scott's direction in this movie is superior. Fresh from his success with the massive Oscar-winning Gladiator, Scott turns this movie from a drama, to a thriller, to a romance, to a horror, to a black comedy and so on and so on. He mixes a lot of genres so there is something for everyone. Of course as you probably already know, this movie is mostly a horror film, and is definitely not for the faint-hearted, so don't go in expecting a black romantic comedy! Anyway, back to Scott's direction. Moodiness is the style that Scott presents his spectacular film in, and he endlessly uses touches to add that extra bit of perfection into the suspense scenes. I liked the way Scott keeps the level of intensity in the air at all times during the film, it added to the unpredictably and scariness of the film.<br />Hans Zimmer has done an excellent score for this film. The track about Clarice is really just quite brilliantly played. The music sort of expresses how Clarice is a gold-knuckles girl on the outside but a somewhat confused and frightened woman on the inside. Zimmer allows many of his \\"dangerous\\" sounding tracks to make us keep on task about the murders and gore in the movie. Zimmer, as usual, has made a winning musical approach to this movie.<br />All in all, Hannibal is a movie that grows and grows on you with each viewing. It's great to see our favourite and smartest baddie out in the open and seeking his next meal. If anything, this movie definitely confirms this character is one who'll never get tired or boring.<br />MY GRADE: A-
B00000J7SS|5.0|As I write these words, \\"Spanish Key\\" is blasting through my headphones! Miles and his electric/jazz orchestra created something truly magical and brilliant that weekend in August 1969 and the world of music has yet to recover.  Mmmmmmm, Wayne Shorter is soloing right this second....Awesome. To call \\"Bitches Brew\\" the first shot fired in the Fusion War is a gross understatement. To say it's the most challenging, ethereal, frightening and ingenious music ever recorded (just hear Miles' intro on the 27 minute title cut) is more like it. My life has never been the same since I first heard it 15 years ago, and I'm truly better off for the experience. A MASTERPIECE.

B000000H3Z|5.0|The 80's was a great time for underground Thrash metal acts like Magadeath, Metallica, Anthrax and Slayer to release classic albems, but my one of my personal favorite thrash albums, and bands came straght out of South America. Beneath the Remains is simply amazing. The lyics and drumming are unmatchable. It sounds as if there are two drummers instead of just one. Even though I like Sepultura's lastest stuff fine, they will never match their older music. Beneath the Remains is one of my favorite albums.<BR>I am a teen, but it is no supries to learn that there are lots of adult headbangers around today thanks to Sepultura or a band alot like them. Sadly alot of kids my age are stuck in a world of Limp Bizket and Kid Rock. I guess they don't know what real metal is. Long Live Sepultura!
B00004RF98|5.0|This was the first DVD I bought (even before I actually owned a DVD player) and if I could only own one DVD, this would be it.  \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" is filled with likeable, humable tunes throughout. The dancing is spectacular.  And the story and comedy elements are sidesplitting.  The DVD is not letterboxed because its 1.37:1 aspect, still the norm in 1952, is about the same as the 1:33:1 TV screen.  It's too bad that the film was about 4 years too early for widescreen and stereo sound.  Some would select \\"The Sound of Music\\" as the greatest musical.  Certainly no one in \\"Rain\\" has a voice half as good as Julie Andrews.  But then, there are no dancers in \\"Music\\" on par with Gene Kelley or Donald O'Connor.  I find \\"Rain\\" holds up to repeated viewings better. A perfect film?  No.  Neither is \\"Citizen Kane.\\"   What is missing from the DVD are the feature commentary, documentary, and outtakes included on the various Laser Disc releases.  Also some versions of the DVD jacket imply that one of the audio tracks has an isolated music track (that is a track without dialogue and sound effects). A few DVDs have offered this feature and the music tracks are nearly always kept separate from dialogue and effects to facilitate foreign language dubbing, but there is no such feature on this DVD.  It's odd that this film, usually included on lists of the top 10 American Films of all time, is given so little respect by its copyright owners. This is a much better film than \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" which MGM/UA re-releases on video every few years with fancy packaging, a multitude of extras, and lots of marketing hype.
B00000JZI9|4.0|Now I tell you, I give my right arm for a western like this one. This is a modern day Classic by Lawrence Kasden, and he did a good job on this one. The Music Score is just great and if you remember, they used this opening music for one of the NBA's Alstar games years ago.<BR>   Add this to your collection of Westerns along  side \\"John Wayne\\" and \\"Clint Eastwood\\" Classics. I like \\"Kevin Costner\\" in this one.
B00005N9CV|3.0|...and every track sounds the same!  Her earlier stuff was better, but I admit that Krall's excellent expression and feeling shine through the ever-present cloud of violins.  This album doesn't show Diana Krall at her best.
B00005U2LM|4.0|I thought the Wu dropped off a little bit with some poor solo albums and a decent outing with \\"The W\\".  However, Iron Flag is an improvement and a step in the right direction to get the Wu back on top.  In the Hood, Rules, Chrome Wheels, Uzi, One of these Days, and Y'all Been Warned are my favorite tracks.  The RZA is back doing most of the production, with some help from Mathematics, Tru Master, Tone & Poke, and Fury Loftin.  The Wu always have great MCing, the question is whether you'll like the production or not.
B00001IVQT|5.0|Ashkenazy plays with plenty of power and passion in these recordings, and the sound quality is quite good.  The Second is superbly executed, but the Third could be a bit more tenderly played.  But, as Rachmaninoff said, this concerto was written \\"for elephants.\\"  It's still one of the best renditions I've heard, and is at a good price.  Don't pass this one up.
B00005JKBC|1.0|I have that same caption issue as everyone else; and it's not the normal subtitles, either.  That, I could deal with.<br />These are all over the screen.<br />Someone at Universal screwed up, methinks, and I won't be keeping this DVD.  It takes a lot for me to return one, but I can't stand watching it [I, too, had to switch and watch it on a cheesy early model rca].<br />I'll bet it would be a good movie, but, ew[...]  Were they trying to make them distracting?
B00005JKED|5.0|With a great performance by Denzel Washington this movie will catch your attention since the first minute to the last one. Is an action thriller about a young L.A.P.D. officer -Jake Hoyt- (Ethan Hawke) who wants to move to the narc division. In his first day, his training day, he is going to be tested by the twisted leader of a narc squad Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Hoyt will learn \\"techinques\\" and \\"procedures\\" not included in the procedure manual and will be challenged by Harris to play his dangerous game.<BR>The cast includes music stars Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg.<BR>You'll see why Washington won the Oscar for this movie. You'll love him. He was fantastic, explosive, funny and hard. There's no doubt Denzel can perform any character he's asked to.

B00005QK3W|4.0|I am a 32 year old drummer who has grown up loving the Beatles and some of McCartney solo work. I felt that he has done some great things with Wings and his earlier solo efforts during the seventies.  However, I felt he hit a low point in his career during the eighties with albums like Tug of War, Pipes of Peace, and especialy Press to PLay. <BR> I felt he started to break out of his slump with Flowers in the Dirt and Off The Ground, but I felt something was still lacking particularly in the quality of his voice and songwriting, but with the release of Flaming Pie in 1997, I felt Paul had turned a new corner and was back on track.  His voice seemed to be improved and his sense of melody was back.<BR>  I feel that driving Rain is equaly as ambitious as Flaming Pie.  His voice sounds really good again, and I like the energy of his young band.  Paul also hired David Kahnea who is a rock alternative producer to produce his record. <BR> There are some really good tunes on this album such as About You, Lonely Road, Your Way, Magic,Heather, and even Driving Rain. <BR> So what if the lyrics are a bit simplistic on some songs.  The hooks and melodies are there.  The musicianship is good, and Paul's voice is sounding better than it did during the eighties. <BR> Frankly, I am shocked that this album has sold so poorly in the USA.  The radio stations need to give this album a fair chance.

In hands of a real writer this would have been 500 page book and possible good. As written it isn't even readable. Nothing happens for hundreds of pages. The only thing to keep you turning pages is the thought something must happen. Characters like Eddard Stark are so one sided they are a joke. Everything that happens is forced. Characters are never rational. Most of the scenes are contrived. The whole off with his head thing is so pathetic. Then I am left wondering what third grader edited the book. Does Martin know how to say anything without thirty layers of nonsense surrounding it? Doubtful...No, oops that's he said doubtfully, anxiously, darkly...Oops no, I meant he spit or should I have said. No Martin wouldn't have. His characters don't say.

B000021XS0|5.0|I can't hype this album up enough.  It's one of my top three favorites (along with Metallica's Ride the Lightning and Queensryche's Operation:Mindcrime), and it is without a doubt Dream Theater's best.  So many well crafted songs weaved together with an intriguing story.  DT has been criticized for not having enough emotion in their playing but in this album they pour out their hearts as each song touches you at your soul.  Highlights include Overture, Strange Deja Vu, Home, and Finally Free.  Get this album.  Everyone I've played it to has really enjoyed it.  I'm not sure if DT (or anyone for that matter) will be able to outdo this album in the future.

He offers us tales of smuggling on the border, Lord Grenville, yet also gives us whimsical Sand in Your shoes and If it Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave it.<br />There is his signature Year of the Cat which is mysterious and intriquing, and with highly visual images and lines such as &quot;you go strolling through the crowd like Peter Lorre contemplating a Crime..&quot; But also balances this with the haunting, near sad Midas Shadow, Broadway Hotel and maybe (?) autobiographical On Stage Before.<br />This is a feast for someone hungry for more than bebop!!<br />One of my favourites!!
B01L3TCBMQ|4.0|The first half of It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I almost envy the people who still haven't figured out that you need to flip the DVD over to finish it lol.<br /><br />Kidding aside, the second half isn't terrible, but the reason this movie has survived and flourished in popularity is 100% because of the first half. The kids and the story are just too good. And you finally get to watch it (It?) in its original aspect ratio on Blu-ray. Guess I can finally toss that EP VHS tape out now. Also, Amazon - get it together. I ordered this and Salem's Lot three weeks after their release date from Best Buy because of your silly nonsense.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This film is amazing.<br />It's not for people who want nice little movies that you don't have to think about... It ranks up there as a recent film (that makes you think) with Memento.The graphics are astounding and the points that the characters make are also. Definitely for intellectuals, artists, and people who want to think!
B000056WTC|5.0|WELL IVE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE BUT EVERYONE ELSE SAYS ITS GOOD! I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS; IS THERE ANY FEMALE FIGHTING IN THE MOVIE?<BR>&amp;<BR>IS THERE ANY WIRE-FU OR FLYING IN THE MOVIE OR DOES BRUCE LEE DOES THE FIGHTING HIMSELF?
B00005OWEG|4.0|I have both the original and redux versions of Apocolypse Now.The Original has always been one of my all time favorite films. The true definition of a masterpiece. Redux? Well it's clear, after watching Redux, why they cut scenes from films. Sure they are interesting (it's nice to see the original version), but most of the cut scenes make Cpt Willard (Martin Sheen) seem like a buddy to the boat crew. From stealing the surfboard to getting playmates for the boys inside the helicopter. Cpt Willard  (sheen) is better in the original when he seems distant from the crew. The French plantation scene is a total waste (but nice to see in comparison). I recommend you get both(too bad they don't have it on one DVD).
6304240554|5.0|A classic horoor film not as good as Ultimate Street Brawls but good none the less.
0790732203|5.0|It's hard to believe teen comedies were actually good once. I just saw this movie for the first time and I found it entertaining. Tom Cruise plays a teen who gets in way over his head with hookers and pimps. He was a lot younger when he made this and his acting is pretty weak but this movie is a good way to pass some time. I liked it.
B000001GEM|5.0|I just compared Klemperer/Gardiner/3 Karajan's versions/Masur/Barenboïm /Shaw. This is the one I prefer because of the singing tempo, the articulation is just superb, very tuneful. If only, the solists were rather the Janovitch &amp; Meyer combo of another Karajan's version but whose rythm is too flat &amp; bland compared to this one, the ideal match would be met. I also really liked Rodney Gilfry in Gardiner's version &amp; Janet Williams in Barenboïm's.
B00003CYLT|4.0|The most important thing to understand about this DVD is that \\"Journey of Man\\" was originally created for an IMAX 3-D presentation.  I saw it in the theaters and was blown away, and so I bought the DVD as a reminder of that experience.  The sound on the DVD was spectacular, drawing out the beauty of the soundtrack, but there are inherent limitations on the visual side.  Because IMAX's aspect ratio is close to that of a TV, there's no need to letterbox this feature, but there's no way to capture either the size of the IMAX screen or the 3-D effects that made it so spectacular.<br />All of the acts were taken from the various touring Cirque shows:  The opening \\"Taiko\\" from Mystere, some synchronized swimming from \\"O\\", \\"Cube\\" from Alegria, \\"Statue\\" and \\"Banquine\\" from Quidam, and so on.  I'm not sure that there were any original acts, but each of the performances here has been further stylized and put into a setting that frees the act from the constraints of the stage, making each one larger and more powerful.  \\"Statue\\" is especially striking, as the performers in full-body grey makeup perform on a vivid green leaf floating in a black pool.  The colors are beautiful throughout, and the performances are, of course, spectacular.  The acts are connected by sequences that were amazing on the big screen but feel a little bit unnecessary in the living room.<br />The storyline explores the \\"child-like wonder\\" theme of previous Cirque productions, but I think that the theme is both better portrayed and has more of an impact here than I've felt in Cirque's other work.  There are all sorts of amazing things in the world if you keep looking, and what you think you want isn't always what you need most.<br />Basically, this DVD is a good buy for rabid Cirque fans who need to have everything that Cirque has produced, people who never got a chance to see Mystere, \\"O\\", or Alegria and so can enjoy some acts they haven't previously seen, or for those of artistic bent who don't mind shelling out the money for a 35-minute presentation of beautiful staging and cinematography.  I fall into all three categories and am very happy with my purchase.<br />However, EVERYONE should see this in its original IMAX 3-D format.  On the big screen it truly is an amazing spectacle throughout.  On the small screen it's more of a novelty.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I think I watched this movie for approximately 30 minutes before I then turned it off.  I really could not get into it.  I was lost.<br />I bought the DVD, but decided to rent the movie and watch it first...I'm glad that I did. I returned the un-opened DVD the next day.  <br />I know that some people said it was great, but in my opinion it wasn't.  If a movie doesn't grab me in the first few scenes or at least in the first 30 minutes, then forget it.
0060920386|5.0|This book is a description of the largest leveraged-buy out of the 80's.   The book covers the management buy out of RJR and all the financial moves that took place to get it done.   It covers the winners and losers and the tactics they used.    The authors are investigative reports so they have the ability to provide the reader with a very well constructed and easy to understand story.  They really bring the reader into the negotiations and all the high pressure and tension is coved to the reader.  The most fun was when the authors took to describing all the financial players involved, their egos and ways of life and doing business.   The excesses of some of the companies detailed are really something.    <BR>If you are interested in this topic then I would suggest you also read \\"Den of Thieves\\" and \\"Predator's Ball\\", both of which cover the 80's M&A and Junk Bond world.   To get a better understanding of KKR, I would suggest \\"Masters of Debit\\" and if you are looking for more info on this particular deal I would suggest \\"True Greed\\".
B00005RY7X|4.0|For the last 10 years we have had to deal with bands who were SO serious that they took the fun out of music. \\"I GET WET\\" brings the fun back to rock. This album is what rock 'n roll is all about! Crank it up, BANG YOUR HEAD, and Party Till You Puke!!!
B00005JKBC|5.0|Spy Game was by far one of the best movies of the year. It keeps you completely focused and wondering what will happen next...most of the time you don't even suspect what happens. It is gripping and dramatic yet keeps you tuned in. There was not a moment in this movie in which my mind was wandering. See this movie...you will not regret it!!!
B0000524CY|5.0|I really don't think of this film, scary as it may be, as a horror movie, but actually an intense human drama that rides on a universal theme: the battle between good and evil, and each person's role in that neverending struggle. Witness Father Karras' guilt over his mother's death, and how Pazuzu tries to wedge his way into Karras' conscience using that guilt. Also there is Chris MacNeil's increasing meanness as Regan's stuation gets more and more hopeless...Probably my favorite movie and a very beautiful story, believe it or not.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) albums of all-time.  I bought this album on whim one time, and boy am I lucky I did: it's amazing.  But this isn't an album for a slouch.  Nope, you have to work to appreciate this album.  Sure, some of the tracks are catchy by themselves (Money stands out) but to appreciate and understand this masterpiece fully you have to listen to the entire thing through.  At first I did not think DSOTM was anything special, but thats because I wasn't listening to the album as a whole.  Without listening to track one you probably won't appreciate and/or understand the last track.  This is simply becuase the music and ideas are intertwined throughout the entire album.<br />I would definetly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys good music, but not everyone will have the patience to listen to the whole thing a few times to extract the \\"deeper meanings\\".  So  if and when you get this album try and appreciate its entire beauty, not just the surficial ones that any idiot could comprehend and I know you will enjoy it.
B00003CY0V|2.0|I find it strangely amusing that while this film was clearly made with the ambition to become an icon for being THE epitome of unflinching cinematic violence, it's level of style and substance never gets above that of &quot;Howard the Duck.&quot; Don't think youre going to see another &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; here.
B00003CY6M|2.0|I was highly disappointed by this sappy romantic comedy. My main problem with it is that it's predictable and quite unrealistic. I know, I know... you're saying \\"but that's the point!\\", but c'mon, there needs to be a drop of reality in there somewhere. On the other hand, if you're looking for a \\"feel good\\" movie to see with a loved one, this may just fit the bill. One other problem I had with this was again, dealing with reality. The NYT's office is located on W 43rd St, not 42nd St, and in some points, it was clear that it was being filmed in Toronto, and not NYC.
B00000016W|5.0|Any serious music lover realizes this is a crucial collection of material to have. Wilson is at his creative best in this album. Just as we can say Sgt Pepper is a creative watershed for the Beattles, this is true for the Beach Boys.. The harmonies are equisite. The music without the lyrics have patterns reminnisent of clssical composers.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I have to admit I was hesitant to watch this with the kids, having read that some of the language and humor were inappropriate, and some of it does seem gratuitous and needlessly provocative; it would be a better film without.  But it's so much fun, so energetic, and the computer generated animation looks so good, that I suppose it can be grudgingly forgiven a few excesses.   <br />The filmmakers have taken William Steig's fairly minimal story and expanded it into a full blown fairy tale, complete with an evil lord, a dragon, and a plot borrowed from Beauty and the Beast.  Then they've given the whole thing a post-Modern twist that Steig would surely approve of, with insider jabs at Disney, Princess Fiona reenacting slo-mo kung fu scenes from Cameron Diaz's Charlie's Angels role, and various other humorous touches that give an adult overlay to a film that kids enjoy at an entirely different level.<br />But for all the snarky humor, the Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy antics, and the impressive technology, the most delightful irony is that movie ends up working because of the way it taps into classic themes.  Shrek, the ugly and much-feared ogre, goes and rescues the princess after Lord Farquaad promises to restore the misanthropic privacy of his swampy home.  But over the course of their adventure the previously solitary ogre becomes friends with donkey and falls in love with Fiona.  Together they learn timeless lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and the true nature of beauty...I very much like the poetic justice of the filmmakers retreat.  But, of course, I'm a bourgeois and believe in those homilies.<br />GRADE : A
B00004U30D|5.0|To be honest, this film looked boring when I saw the previews - another story about bored people in Middle class suburbia. Thankfully my boss talked me into renting it and boy am I ever glad he did.  From the very first moment until the last I was glued to the screen. <BR>The performances are brilliant, every time you think you know a character they progress to another level, none of them realizing that their pathos and dreams and nightmares and joy and sorrow will all collide in the final few moments of the film, altering their course forever.  What is amazing is the trip that you are given in route to those final moments - the subtle combination of every human emotion is explored in ways which will make you smile one minute, and wince the next. <BR>The scene where the next door neighbor shows his video of a paper bag &quot;dancing&quot; in the wind is one of the single best moments I have ever encountered in cinema.<BR>I honestly don't know how to describe this film in words except to say that it is perhaps the closest I've ever seen to perfection in film !!<BR>BUY IT, BUY IT, BUY IT !!
B000002B7O|5.0|This album really was about as good as Blizzard of Ozz. Ozzy gives us some more great singing a Randy delivers the goods with the help of Bob and Lee. (If you are bored and want to try out a different version of this album ceck out the New remaster but, don't get it if you don't a copy of this album at all. The new one is terrable.) Noice that all the songs I reviewed down below have at least a 90%. That tells you that this one is a keeper! Now onto my review of the tracks:  1. Over The Mountain - I like this one for the Positive sound and the beat. The messenge Ozzy Gives rules! . . .95% 2. Flying High Again - You will truly feel like your flying high with this one. Great Rock tune. Good for getting Partys started too! . .. 95% 3. You Can't Kill Rock And Roll - A song where Ozzy states what everyone in Rock music feels. We may be not so cool or hip, but Where here to stay! By the way this is one of my Fav. Songs by Ozzy every!  . .100% +4. Believer - A sort of thinker of a song. I enjoy the positive thoughts Ozzy shares in this song. A uplifting song.  . . .95% 5. Little Dolls - I enjoy this songs sound. It's not a major hit track, but great background music.  . . .90%6. Tonight - A Ballad all the way! But he leaves it in a nice way. It also is a reflection time ,like song. . . .90% 7. S.A.T.O. - The ship is waiting on the shore. Like the last song he's reflecting. . . .90%8. Diary Of A Madman - Sad last song of his insanity. Weird keyboards and stuff really make this song interesting.  . . .95%If you like this album may I suggest the following: Ozzy Osbourne - Blizzard of Ozz (Blue Border), Ozzy Osbourne - Bark at the Moon (Grey Border), Ozzy Osbourne - No More Tears (Brown Border),Black Sabbath - Vol. 4.
B000002LVB|3.0|The Velvet Underground is one of the greatest bands ever.<BR>Obviously. And their first three lps are brilliant, beautiful, <BR>inspiring and 100% indispensable. I am loathe to admit it, because i think John Cale is by far the most talented and musically astute Velvet, but \\"The Velvet Underground\\" (album #3) is a revelation - an accomplishment that is truly on the same level as the banana album and \\"White Light/White Heat.\\"<br />  \\"Loaded\\" isn't even in the ball park. I began listening to the VU nearly a decade ago and my taste in music has evolved constantly. I'm always finding new fave bands and leaving others in the past. However, I go back and listen to the VU periodically and they blow me away as much now as the first time i heard them - maybe even a little more. <BR>I basically never listen to \\"Loaded\\" anymore.<br />  \\"Loaded\\" is inexplicably overrated. Actually, i can see why.<BR>It happens to have two AMAZING songs. \\"Sweet Jane\\" and especially \\"New Age.\\" \\"Sweet Jane\\" you know about even if you only a casual VU fan. It's one hell of a well-written rock and roll song - no doubt about it.  <br />   \\"New Age\\" (especially the extended version that's on the \\"Peel Slowly and See\\" boxed-set and the less essential \\"Re-Loaded\\" re-issue) is one of the most moving songs i've ever heard. It's as beautiful as \\"Candy Says,\\" but more emotionally complex.  <br />  It feels crazy to say this about a VU record, but a lot of the <BR>other songs are [junk] - filler. \\"Who Loves the Sun,\\" \\"Rock and Roll,\\" \\"Oh! Sweet Nothin'\\" are listenable. <br />  Songs like Cool in Down and I Found a Reason are just crap, though. Doug Yule has a good voice for certain occassions, but have you noticed that he's kind of an idiot? It's one thing to not be able to write lyrics like Lou Reed, but sometimes it seems like he doesn't even quite get the lyrics he's singing.<br /> And the music is at times pretty conventional and dull. <BR>Think about the closing of \\"Waiting for the Man\\" or Cale's organ on \\"Sister Ray.\\" Compare it to \\"Train Round the Bend.\\" Yawwwn.<BR>\\"Loaded\\" is way over-produced. Any life that may have been in these songs at one point was sucked out in the studio.<BR>  <BR>  If you're looking to buy your first VU record, please choose anything but this. Their albums of un-released tracks, \\"VU\\" and \\"VU: Another View\\" are both more rewarding than \\"Loaded.\\"
B000063DIR|1.0|Ozzy must be mad to have made such a terrabe remaster. The rerecording of the Bass and Drums is showing in a really bad way! BOB and LEE were better Ozzy! Take note that this album is lower than even Blizzard. The album is even more off and out of sink than the other. GET THE GREEN BORDER COPY OF THIS ALBUM AND NOT THIS VERSION!!! unless you must have it all. Now onto my review of the tracks:  1. Over The Mountain - Sound effects are messed up and we get a eve more out of sink sound than the sounds on Blizzard.  . . .65% 2. Flying High Again - Not on the mark either. Sound is yet again off badly. But thats the story of this whole mess.  . .65% 3. You Can't Kill Rock And Roll - The Worst remake I've ever heard! The Bass is out of place and in the way of Randy's Guitar! The Drums are out of step as well. Even the vocals are slightly bad sounding which puzzles me. I thought remastering was a good thing?! Oh well. By the way, this was my fav. song for this album. . . .45%(DESTROYED!)4. Believer - Decent intro and the sound effects are more aparent but other things hurt it. Ozzy sounds like he did this song another room. But it's about the only song where they sounded better than Bob and Lee somewhere. Sadly the song still sounds bad. but I'llgive them credit for trying . . .80% 5. Little Dolls - I thought for a second there, they were going to add a bit to it, but sadly they fall short. Vocals are like destorted, and things sound off. Sounds like the drummer is trying to sound like leading the song when they really ain't following.  . . .65%6. Tonight - Sounds off, I hear defects everywhere (By the second Verse). Perhaps the first remasters hid this problem, but It hurts. it almost sounds like Ozzy resang it and messed up. Fans may want to look into this a little. Bassist sounds out of place at the end as well.  . . .55%7. S.A.T.O. - Intro sounds decent till they speed, then this falls out of sink. Bass is off by a mile. Vocals have an echo to them which sounds wrong. Drums hit wrong everytime they start up.  . . .55%  8. Diary of a Madman - Not too bad, to start. The keyboard effects are mixed lower and drums are louder. Maybe dcent to some. It's not as good as the other version of the album however. . . .70% 9. I Don't Know (Live) - I'm not a big fan of live versions of songs. This one sounds decent I guess. Some told me that this same live recording is on Tribute ,but since I don't listen to that one much either.... . . .70%If you like the 1995 remastered version of this album I would suggest: Ozzy Osbourne - Blizzard of Ozz(Blue Border), Ozzy Osbourne - Bark at the Moon (Grey Border),  Ozzy Osbourne - Ozzmosis, and Black Sabbath - Vol. 4.
B000003CMD|4.0|Although I generally don't like country rock music, the Allman Brothers are just good, with enough alluring rock and blues to make me forget the country.  However, Brothers and Sisters has more of a country flavor than other of their albums. \\"Ramblin' Man\\" is a good song but, as well as a classic, it is a classic radio-tired song.  Not to knock it, for people know that.  I also like \\"Southbound,\\" straight blues and fast-paced, strong musically, zippy soloing.  The rest, to be honest, doesn't interest me except...<br />Yes, I think Dickie Betts has the stronger entries on the album.  And yes, the reason I am writing this review is because of \\"Jessica.\\"  Betts may have composed it with his little daughter in mind, but boy, it is about all of us.  Musically brilliant, but can anyone think of a WARMER song, country rock or otherwise?  Rich in texture and spirit, it exudes brightness and optimism.  Chuck Leavell's piano jamming hardly falls short of Betts' brilliant guitar, either, and the organ glows in the background.  It is the Allmans' acme, apologizes to Duane, and simply one of the best things ever written.  Certainly, \\"Jessica\\" alone justifies getting Brothers and Sisters.  And if you like the Allmans' country style more than I, there is more reason.
B000002B7M|5.0|About the only thing bad about this version of the album, is the cover. This Album was what started the whole Ozzy solo thing, after being kicked out of Black Sabbath. He went thru his ups and downs before gettng to the point of making music again.  Thanks to the talents of Randy, Bob and Lee (If you disagree with Bob and Lee's usefullness, go buy the newly recorded remaster which will make you sick!) and Ozzy, We get this great album. By the way, doves taste good with contracts! lol. Onto my review of the songs:1. I Don't Know - Ozzy tells us that he doesn't really know the answers. It's a middle pace song with a good beat. . .90%2. Crazy Train - The biggest song of all. This Sad song later became a symbal of Randys Rhoads as a passing Star. RIP.  . .100%3. Goodbye To Romance - Such a soft song. A goodbye to Black Sabbath is what Ozzy said he wrote the song about.  . . .90% 4. Dee (Guitar instrumental)- Randy performs this great, and to this day is a trademark of Randy and many young guitar players start out play this guitar Instrumenal.  . .85% 5. Suicide Solution - All about drinking. The song is condemning drinking. Of coarse someone missunderstood the music. But thats a story best left to the history of Ozzy. .  . .90%6. Mr. Crowley - Well this song was written to Crowley. Cool trippy song in a way. I also enjoy Randys guitar in this one alot.  . .95% 7. No Bone Movies - This Song is a mid paced song that is about being a porn additic. A fun song really tho.  . . 85%8. Revelation (Mother Earth) - About the end of the world. Somewhat sad, and doomy! I enjoy the piano /guitar bridge. Randy Rules! . . .100% 9. Steal Away (The Night) - A Quick Runaway Love song. So it's a tad odd for ozzy t do it. So what?! It's cool. . .90%If you Like this album check out: Ozzy Osbourne - Diary of a Madman (Green Border), Ozzy Osbourne - Bark at the Moon (Grey Border), Ozzy Osbourne - No More Tears (Brown Border), Black Sabbath - Paranoid (remaster).
0966638328|5.0|I need to come up with lots of design ideas constantly and this is the best resource of its type. It's open on my desk constantly. And it makes a great gift for designer/artist friends who love to play with color. It's simple, doesn't go into a lot of theory (read Itten and Albers for that), but the color combinations are wonderful--with really nice layout examples. It's designed for print (CMYK) but works just as well for Web design (RGB). It really is one of my favorite books.
B000063DFN|5.0|Iron Maiden at their absolute best!  This album is what Maiden was all about in the 80s, at their peak and best.  The songs fit perfectly well together and they tell their stories beautifully thanks to the hi power vocals of Bruce Dickinson.  If you ever wondered about Maiden, pick this up and get hooked quick.  Videos and all kinds of extras add to the value of all the enhanced CDs.
B000050IE6|5.0|This Opeth release has many slow, mellow parts (and also parts where the music is heavy but there is clean singing) and few heavy, violent screaming sections. This is Opeth's most mellow CD to date, 2 of the 7 songs here have absolutely no death metal vocals. Of course I like the mellow side of Opeth better but that is all up to your personal taste. If you don't have any Opeth albums yet get this first if you think you'd like the mellow parts better. You'll get used to the death vocals and learn to accept them. If you're already more of an extreme metalhead, go with Morningrise first.
B00005RHGK|5.0|I thought that this film was very well put together. It is terribly scary and will give you chills every time you watch it! The creeper was the most grousome thing you could ever see with him ripping out tounges and eating hearts to survive. You even see him in the daylight dressed in dirty clothes and driving a beat-up truck. When he dumps dead bodies down a pipe, the two teens go to see what they were. The guy falls down the pipe and finds bodies all over the wall. He is scared for life when he sees that. The ending of this movie is completly unexpected and is sad as well. GO RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXE7|2.0|I agree with Roger Ebert, this [was terrible]! I thought Crowe would be great, like he's a great actor! He [wasn't]! Pheonix had no depth like he did in Signs! He showed no enthusiasm, he was dull and his character was in love with his sister, how dumb is that? The sister wasn't any help! The hero was a gladiator, no problem there, only a dull gladiator, problem! The only one I liked was the slave that helped out Maximus(Crowe), he was pretty good! And of course, I like Russel Crowe but he was bad in this movie, get another one of his, any other of his is better then this,...
B00005Y10C|5.0|This is the German import of M!ssundaztood, it includes the exclusive track Catch 22, an R&amp;B dance track that fans of her first album (Can't Take Me Home, 2000) will absolutely love. If you liked Get The Party Started, you must buy this album. Check my reviews (December 19,2001) for a full review of this record, but believe me when I say it is one of the best of last year.
0790734850|5.0|I saw this film on a holiday weekend when it first came out. We were a group of five relatives and everyone had different tastes in film.  We finally decided to try this movie without much hope of anyone being too happy, but instead every single person loved it. It is a thriller and a romance and a tale of good versus evil. Set in 1950s Los Angeles and based to a small degree on actual events, this tale of corruption in Hollywood and the LAPD, with 80 speaking parts and 45 locations, deservedly won many awards. The cast is fantastic -- amazing that two young Australian actors held their own against veterans James Cromwell, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito -- but Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe made their big American splash with this film; Kim Basinger does her best work here, and the supporting cast is flawless.  Director Curtis Hanson preserves some of the elements of the traditional film noir, like voiceover, plot twists and hidden motives, while updating others, such as the use of more natural lighting and a more character-driven story.<br /><br />DVD extras are plentiful and fun.  The soundtrack is in English or French, the subtitles in English, French or Spanish; there is also a music only soundtrack.  Extra features include: cast and crew credits; text and pictures covering the characters of Dragnet and Bloody Christmas, 1951 -- an event similar to that in the film; prices for various items in 1953; awards the film won; three television ads and a film trailer; a fun interactive map of 1950s LA; the screen tests of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe; a 19-minute featurette, &#34;Off the Record&#34;, with cast and crew interviews; and the 18-photos used by Curtis Hanson to visualize the project and to pitch the film to the producer and actors.<br /><br />This is a terrific film and the many DVD extras make this edition even more attractive.  Highly recommended.

B00003CXZ1|1.0|For a long time I wanted to see this movie and two nights ago I watched it on DVD... and I was terribly disappointed!<br />This movie lacks all elements of a movie. I see they only used Angelina Jolie to attract audience. The over use of action &amp; CGI is very poor and insulting. The story is very shallow and weak and everything else is as bad.<br />I thought this movie would be &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; of 2001. But it is not! This movie was rated for audience above 13 years old. I am afraid they made a mistake, it should be for audience less than 13 years old.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I think it is so cool that NO Doubt is putting songs that you can dance to. They sing like a cross between techno and something else. I like techno and this CD is so much better than the others because it is easy to dance to. I've like No Doubt since the beginning but this makes me like them even more. So everyone who reads this, but it and just Keep on Dancing.
0800177363|5.0|This movie deserves much more publicity than this. Both Robert De Niro and Robin Williams are great actors and they both did a great job... you feel their emotions are so close and real.<br />This type of movie lives with you for days after you watch it. And you just can't stop thinking of it. And what makes it more powerful is that it is a real story. This movie has no special effects at all except for its highly driven emotions.<br />I truly recommend watching this movie.
B00005OWEG|5.0|Ok, i have to admit, i am biased here. This film is less an examination of war than the nature of man. Every character in it is amazing. The extra footage is not all necessary, although it fills in some things that were missing and adds more. Just knowing what went on during the filming of this is enough to astonish, without even watching the film itself. This film catapults you into the nightmare of the human psyche. Cinematically, the film is an odessy of spectacular visual and audial sensory assaults (i wish you could have olfactory components in movies - this deserves it). It could be a young knight, sent forth by his lord to slay a fearsome beast. In this case, the stark reality of Vietnam is the backdrop and beast is a creation of the lord gone awry. Without overtly judging a single thing about the war or people in it, the film clearly depicts the strong parallels between good and evil, and how thin a line it is that we walk.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Beautiful movie.  Superb graphic and soundtrack.  Classic fairytale in an unconventional style.  There is always movement, and in the slow parts, it's setting the story.  Excellent buy.
B00005JKHP|4.0|While not the most dynamic of the Star Trek films, this film kept with the spirit of the original series more than any. It did not rely on special effects or even dramatics. The story was and continues to be the key to Star trek. Not just a story, the typical Star Trek episodes wrestled with philosophical, moral and scientific quandries beneath a thin veneer of science fiction. More speculative fiction than science fiction (to borrow from one of the shows early writers) it has always tried to capture the wonder of a much-hoped-for idealism of the future facing the brutal realities of the present. The film itself is about discovery and prejudice, about human emotions and the foilables of being human. The evolution of man and machine, of thought and technology, of life and its meaning are all represented in a wonderful story. The film delivers a good story and the characters develop over time. Its a bit slow, and some parts seem to be filler. The special effects are dated, but the content still very relevant. I highly recommend this to fans of the original series, although those seeking high action/adventure films should look to the second in the series for their best bet.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Do not listen to this CD on a rainy day.  You are likely to get very depressed.  This is not a jazz CD.  It is more like a Country and Blues CD.  No diversity in the album whatsoever.  Pass on this one.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Many people have criticized this film. While i agree, the childish humor of jar-jar is tiresome and annoying, it captures a more simple, open feeling which is reflective of the young Skywalker. This film sets the stage for the upcoming tragedy that the other films part of. Peace is coming to an end, innocence has no place in the story being created by Lucas's vision. The parallels between Luke and his father are so easy to see in this film. My only dissapointment in this film (aside from jar-jar) was the Jedi council. It seemed a bit too oppressive and narrow minded... not that i would have any idea what such a society would be like. In all, i liked this film. By the third time i watched it, i was able to tune out Binks and focus on the story of the Jedi and Skywalker.
B000002GYW|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Drastically underrated. Before they developed a harder sound and recruited Joe Walsh, the Eagles were a great country rock band. The group's early albums defined the genre. While I really don't agee that the concept album approach works here, songs like Doolin Dalton, Bitter Creek, Certain Kind of Fool, Desperado, Tequila Sunrise and Outlaw Man make the album a worthwhile venture. If you want to know what the Eagles sounded like before Hotel Calfornia, this is as good a place to start as any. The music on this record influenced many, despite the fact that the Eagles moved on to conquer new territory.
B00005RYLE|4.0|OK, IF you are a horror movie fan and do not already own a copy of ED (shame on you!), Buy this edition before it goes out of print. Best Buy has it for 29.99.<br />IF you already own a previous version of the DVD, then know this:<br /> The only new features are a documentary about the extremes of fandom done by Bruce Campbell (it doesn't deal with ED directly...more to do with off the wall fans), and a featurette focusing on the phenomenon and beginnings of ED's VIDEO success.  No &quot;Within the Woods&quot;, as was so desperately hoped.  The picture seems clearer than the special edition, but the special edition has an insert booklet interviewing the women of ED.  The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; itself is cool.  It has great reproductions of all the pages seen in the movie.  It has an insert booklet that also deals with the early video and european video success of the film all the way to the present time. One drawback though, no case for the DVD save for the pouch in the book.  The book itself is latex coated and seems fragile.  In other words,I don't want to keep it on a shelf with all the rest of my dvd's.
0385484518|5.0|\\"Tuesdays\\" - the chronicle of a young man spending time with a dying teacher who played a central role in mentoring him, is simply an American classic.<br />Writer Mitch Alborn captures the spirit of Morrie, elicits tears and laughter, and brings us face to face with courage and humor in the face of death.  Never afraid of meeting my maker, my feelings were reinforced by the time I spent with Mitch and Morrie.<br />A wonderful read!
B00005JKED|1.0|After Denzel won his Oscar, I rented this expecting a great performance in a great film.  I got neither.  The film was utterly mediocre and, frankly, boring.  Not because there wasn't any action, but because none of the actors gave me any reason to care about the characters.  And all Denzel should have gotten was an Oscar for Best Shameless Scenery Chewing by a Lead Actor.  This movie, and Denzel Washington's performance in it, are absolute proof that the Oscars are blatantly political and have nothing to do with the actual quality of any given performance.
B00005V9QJ|1.0|Even though she is one of my favorites, a live CD does her injustice.  Can't really get the true feeling of her voice and songs with all of the clapping and misc noise in the background.  I was very, very disappointed.  Gave it away to the first person who would take it and went back to all of my Sade studio CD's.
B000003CUJ|4.0|Many people are put off or intimidated from listening to Wagner's operas.  &quot;The Ring&quot; is at least 14 CDS long at full length.  It could be daunting to even think of listening to the first note, knowing what's ahead.<BR>  &quot;The Ring Without Words&quot; is a good place to start.  It has Orchestral highlights from all 4 &quot;Ring&quot; operas.  Richard Wagner was and is a controversial composer.  His world and political views were at worst vile and at best kooky.  His personal behavior was low....yet, these orchestral excerpts show the God-given musical genius he possessed right up there with Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven.<BR>  I liked most tracks.  I didn't like the interpretation of &quot;The Magic Fire Music&quot;. For some reason it dragged and it didn't have the expected musical incandescence. The &quot;Siegfried&quot; and &quot;Gotterdamerung&quot; highlights stood out.  The conductor was able to capture &quot;the Noble Savage&quot; aspect in Siegfried with those musical bits.
B000056K04|3.0|This album lacks the major things that dmb is known for such as long jams and solos.  The highlights of this album are the songs so right, if i had it all, and when the world ends.  Also included of course are the radio songs i did it and the space between.  In my opinion the worst song on the album is sleep to dream her.  It is slow and just doesnt have much to it.  If you are a hardcore dave fan you should get the album because it is different than what you are used to, but if you are just starting out go for a live album like red rocks.
B00005NB0H|5.0|I've burned through 2 vinyl copies, and have all the re-releases of Live at Leeds and it never ceases to amaze me. I won't go into the highlites of the disc. Every reviewer here basically took the words out of my mouth. Buy this disc just so you can hear what a proper live disc should sound like. The mix is amazingly crisp, thick and, most importantly, LOUD ! I can't put my finger on it, but when I cranked this disc, it's like getting the wind knocked out of you. Especially \\"Sparks\\". Even jammed at top volume, one can still hear Townshends guitar pick hitting the strings. Simply incredible ! This disc should be required listening for all garage bands anywhere !
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's a shame that some Radiohead fans feel the need to insult or dismiss those who \\"don't get\\" Radiohead, or simply don't like it. It may be driving off potential fans. I shunned Radiohead for some time for this very reason.<br />Bottom line, no one is wrong to like, say, Limp Bizkit more than Radiohead. And this is coming from someone who becomes suicidal when he hears \\"Rollin\\". What may be wrong is dismissing a band without having given it a try.<br />I finally gave them a try after hearing \\"Karma Police\\", which remains my favorite Radiohead song to this day. I downloaded \\"Creep\\", which I immediately recognized as one of those songs I never could identify of but loved to listen to on the radio. Acting on suggestions from several friends, I tried \\"Paranoid Android\\" from OK Computer, \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"Life in a Glass House\\" from Amnesiac, and \\"My Iron Lung\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" off The Bends. Some, like Paranoid Android and Life in a Glass House, I loved immediately. The others have since grown on me immensely.<br />I bought OK Computer a month ago, and it is my sole Radiohead album right now. My favorites:<br />2. Paranoid Android - My second favorite song off the CD. Like others have said, it seems like 3 songs in one. \\"Ambition makes you look very ugly.\\"<br />3. Subterranean Homesick Alien - I just love the mood this puts me in. It seems a perfect fit for a rainy day, yet it's uplifting.<br />4. Exit Music (For A Film) - Just like the title says, I could see this fitting well into the end of a drama. Starts slowly, builds up greatly.<br />6. Karma Police - As I said before, my favorite Radiohead song. Great guitar at the beginning, cool lyrics, and vocals that make the song sound like a milestone.<br />8. Electioneering - The seventh track, Fitter Happier, has an android on vocals. Strange, and IMO, quite interesting, but Electioneering is a welcome change. It's a fast-paced rocker. Like many of the songs here, the vocals are the best part.<br />So, if you'recurious about Radiohead, try the songs listed in this review. If you don't like 'em, don't sweat it. We weren't meant to have identical musical taste.<br />I would recommend getting OK Computer or The Bends.
B000060K4O|5.0|I ain't afraid of no ghost because they make me laugh.  In this 1984 comedy, Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd, and Harold Ramis play paranormal investigator/exterminators who go around New York City hunting ghosts.  At first, business is bad, but all of the sudden, the phones are ringing off the hook.  They believe it to be luck, but when Murray's girlfriend (Sigourney Weaver) and her neighbor (Rick Moranis) become possessed, they must find the source of these paranormal occurences.  It all culminates to the famous battle between the Ghostbusters and the Sta-Puft Marshmallow Man!  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll... SCREAM!
B000002C1V|5.0|The hell of war...insanity at its best.  Best Floyd album ever.  Makes you dig deep.  Makes you see the demons.  Makes you real.  Want reality?  Want a pictue of yourself?  See it.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is not in my collection YET, but it will be VERY soon!  After hearing the 3 hit singles on the radio- Lateralis, Parabola, and Schism, I will be heading off to the music store VERY soon to buy it.  Lateralis may be one of the most artistic pieces of work in a Tool song I've ever heard, and I NEVER get tired of Parabola.  Schism is one of those songs that inspires you to sit back and think about what Maynard is talking about when he says &quot;to free the pieces back together and re-discover communication.&quot;  I'm sure, from what I've heard from other fans, that all the rest of the songs are damn good, and that this might be Tool's best work yet.  I'll have to find out!
B00004XMV6|5.0|This is the film started it all. The story line is simple.  A cool, distant man, Mickey Rourke, a beautiful charming woman, Kim Bassinger, who was pushed by the man that she loved into doing some things that she would not normally do. The movie was all about the man, the woman and his games. The whip scene made the &quot;Un-Rated&quot; version but not the theatrical version. This scene gave the theatrical version a x-rating. The film was well written, well acted and directed and the themes worked so well that Mr. King used simular themes in the films &quot;Two Moon Junction&quot; and &quot;Wild Orchid&quot;.
B000007MVX|5.0|Simply, close your eyes and listen to this version...THEY ARE IN THE ROOM!
B00005U11Z|5.0|Well, I figured since people who have never seen the DVD can review it and give it one star, I thought I throw in a few extra stars to offset their reviews!  Come on people, if you haven't seen the DVD and just want to put your two cents in about how you hate the band's current lineup, do us a favor and leave the stars blank!!
B00005RY7X|5.0|When rock was created oh so long ago, this is what, as another reviewer said, what our \\"fore fathers\\" meant for rock to sound like.<BR> Lets name some other bands that are simple, but great, just to prove my point KISS, Iron Maiden, Poison, Motley Crue, Ozzy, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and ect, ect,ect.<BR> Do you see what I mean, its all about the feeling the music gives to you, not if the guitar part is blazing fast and impossible to play unless your on speed.<BR> It's just about what it makes you think and feel, and this album brings that idea back into music.<BR> Besides, its also one of the most original albums I've heard in a while.
B000003S0R|4.0|After his guitar-fuzz-coated solo debut, 1973s Here Comes the Warm Jets, Brian Eno washed away the distortion and worked within a clear, fluid sound for his second album, 1974s Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy. Ironically, the change makes Tiger sound even stranger than its predecessor. When taken as abrasive, Velvet Underground-ish art rock, Mr. Enos wry vocals and schizoid lyrical games seem somewhat appropriate. When taken as gleaming, Beatles-ish pop, though, they seem idiosyncratic and somewhat startling. Still, Mr. Eno has the formula for engineering a good pop song down pat. Abnormal as they are, the songs of Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy are playful, melodic and infectious as hell (I dare you to find catchier songs being made in 1974 than Back in Judys Jungle and The True Wheel). He may be eccentric and utterly experimental, reveling in cryptic cries about brainwashing and mind-control over wavy, squeaking sonic sparkle, but Mr. Eno knew how to make a track work. Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy is another excellent installment of his experimentation in sardonic, mutant pop.
B00005QK3W|3.0|don't get me wrong, this is a real good album.  its alot better than alot of his other albums.  however, i didnt think it was as good as &quot;Flaming Pie&quot; and certainly not &quot;McCartney&quot;, but it is good and melodic to listen to.
B00005TT77|3.0|In honor of the title character's fixation on The Beatles, the soundtrack to I Am Sam, Jessie Nelson's film about a mentally challenged man's crusade to gain custody of his daughter, features seventeen of the fab four's classics covered by various present-day artists. Ordinarily, such a collection would be many diehard Beatles fans' nightmare. After such painful transgressions as Britney Spears' cover of \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,\\" last year's all-star molestation \\"What's Going On\\" and the dozens of ungodly frankensteins sew together by sample-dependent rappers, we can be forgiven for being apprehensive about today's pop scene entangling The Beatles into the immeasurable mess in which it is in. Luckily, the producers of I Am Sam ignored the artists who most encourage cynicism about today's pop music in classic rock sticklers (No P Diddy and twelve interchangeable cohorts filling \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" with declarations of \\"uh-huh yeah!\\" or Limp Bizkit turning \\"Fixing a Hole\\" into a song about date rape) and invited a plethora of artists more or less outside the mind-numbing mainstream and better known to audiences of public and college radio stations to perform their favorite Beatles tunes.<br />Although there are certainly more than a few who flop, the artists of I Am Sam generally prove why they worthy of the buzz they generate. Rufus Wainright's passionate \\"Across the Universe\\" is a stunner. The Wallflowers deliver a excellent, dry version of \\"I'm Looking Through You.\\" Nick Cave performs a convincing, if somewhat unadventurous \\"Let It Be.\\" Stereophonics bellow out \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" as if it were always meant to be an emo-ish lament. Eddie Vedder dashes and clangs his way through a dazzling \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.\\" And The Black Crows show once again that they are one of the few bands of subsequent decades to successfully flaunt the freewheeling spirit of the nineteen-sixties with their almost faultless rendition of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\"<br />And now, on to I Am Sam's inevitable duds. The Lilth Fair crowd should have perhaps been filed next to teen cheese and pop rap as a troop unworthy of The Beatles' legendary songbook. The contributions from their frilly ranks, \\"Mother Nature's Son,\\" performed by Sheryl Crow, \\"Blackbird\\" by Sarah McLachlan and \\"We Can Work It Out\\" by Heather Nova, have all been flattened into soft rock blather. Former Replacements leader, Paul Westerburg's drowsy-eyed \\"Nowhere Man\\" is excruciating and up-and-coming folky, Howie Day's similarly lethargic \\"Help\\" is not much better. I Am Sam's most horrid wrongdoing, however, is Aimee Mann and her husband, Michael Penn, turning \\"Two of Us,\\" into a cheeky lovebirds' duet. To compare the charming, easy-going original version that opens Let It Be and the cutesy, nauseating cover that opens I Am Sam is to shutter.<br />Although there are a number of covers that would have better been left undone, I Am Sam is laced with enough decent renditions to keep devotees to the fabs from running for the hills. The producers obviously had their ears out for solid, sensible artists who could be entrusted to interpret these songs without turning them gaudy or absurd. The soundtrack is a surprisingly undisastrous contemporary tribute to The Beatles.
B00005QDW5|5.0|FYI, I own all \\"official\\" PF albums (most of them 2-3 copies at least) + Relics + Soundtracks +<BR>all live stuff + number of RoIOs. And I still bought this albom, and I believe that it is the best purchase I made in a while. <BR>Why? Sound quality. This beats hands down all recent and newest remasters, including Japanise, and, no flames please, beats MoFi \\"Gold\\" DSotM hands down, and MoFi long considered to be the best digital release of PF out there. One can compare tracks from MoFi and Echoes, and will be amazed how much better new recording is - warmer midrange, more detailed, but yet less \\"edgy\\" highs, greatly improved imaging and far superior bass, etc. What is rewarding is that recording engineers did not try to \\"de-hiss\\" (read: suck out life) from original tape. \\"Echoes\\" reminds me of some great jazz remasters (\\"Kind of Blue\\",\\"The Great Summit\\", etc.) - spooky good. <BR>No, I will keep now megabuck MoFi for my collection, but when now I am in a mood for \\"Time\\", I am going for \\"Echoes\\".
B00005QW5X|5.0|Think about what rock musicals have been like. It's no surprise that when most people think about the rock musical, they think about midnight showings with tons of obsessed fans screaming as the movie plays out before them, decked in attire identical to that of the characters up on screen. One thinks of cultish style, no substance. In other words, when thinking about the rock musical, one immediately thinks \\"Rocky Horror\\", and there's a reason for that. Finally, someone has decided to take the rock musical seriously and it works better than one could've imagined. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not... \\"HEDWIG!\\" <br />Based on the off-Broadway hit of the same name, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell), and his journey to find his \\"other half\\". While living in East Berlin, Hedwig (then Hansel) meets Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), who over some gummi bears decides to marry him. The only problem is, he has to marry him in Berlin, which would require a physical examination. \\"To get away, you've gotta leave something behind,\\" Luther tells Hansel. So it is agreed that Hansel must have a sex change operation. Unfortunately for Hansel (who changes his name to Hedwig), the doctor botched the operation, leaving him with nothing but an \\"angry inch\\". Luther and Hedwig run off to America, where Luther's wandering eye gets the best of him. Left alone, Hedwig just puts on some makeup, pulls the wig down from the shelf and goes back to her first love of music. That too has its problems: Hedwig gets involved in a relationship with Tommy Speck (Michael Pitt), who steals her music and becomes pop icon Tommy Gnosis. When we meet Hedwig at the beginning of the film, her and her band The Angry Inch are following Gnosis world tour in hopes of landing a successful lawsuit. <br />\\"Hedwig\\" rocks like no other movie I have ever seen. The soundtrack is (in my humble opinion) full of classic songs, and the film is full of audacious numbers to match them. I could easily be convinced that this film was made for upwards of $25 million. But obviously, style isn't dictated by budget (the film was made for $6 million). Just look at \\"Wig in a Box,\\" where a trailer wall is kicked down to become a stage. Or \\"Angry Inch\\", where Hedwig's bold retelling of his past lashes out and causes the whole place to erupt. The music could've easily been tacky, but no. The songs, written by Stephen Trask, are punk rock masterpieces (some highlights including \\"Origin of Love\\", \\"Midnight Radio\\" and \\"Wig in a Box\\") that had me singing for days after. I am now convinced that the music industry would be on its way to redemption if more people could write with the gusto and originality of Stephen Trask's work. <br />The film's characters all have stunning emotional depth. Every character is developed, the relationships seem real, and they are all acted to perfection. That there is already more than you can say about most rock musicals. \\"Hedwig\\" is the brainchild of John Cameron Mitchell. He knows \\"this punk rock star\\" up and down and thus turns in a near flawless performance. Hedwig is bitter, stubborn and sarcastic, but never unpleasant for the audience to be with. Michael Pitt is impressive as the rip-off artist Tommy Gnosis, and Miriam Shor gives a wonderfully layered performance as Yitzak, Hedwig's husband/wife obviously unsure of her place in the world (just like Hedwig herself). <br />\\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" has done what no other rock musical has done before. It refuses to give up the music for the story, or vice versa. Instead, the songs complement Hedwig's journey in such a way that we understand her position even more after each one. Now only one question remains: is \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" the greatest rock musical ever made? Hell, yeah.
B00003CX95|4.0|Although the film is historically inaccurate, it portrayed the main events of Sir Willam Wallace's struggle against King Edward I, Longshanks, i.e, the Battle of Stirling Bridge and the Battle of FalKirk, as well as his execution. Mel Gibson did well in his portrayal of Wallace (he presented a believable image of a Sottish warrior). <BR> Also, the battle scenes are graphic - which add to the impact of the film. It does NOT glorify war and shows that humans shed blood and die. If this was not the first movie to do so, then it was ceratinly one of the first. Since then, realistic battle scenes (e.g. in Saving Private Rayn and Black Hawk Down) have been created.<BR> The film is never boring, even when Wallace is not fighting. The political intrigue and romance in this film are adequate (and well developed for an action film). Well done Mel.
B000065U1N|4.0|I was skeptical going into \\"Black Hawk Down\\". After all, just look at the credits. Ridley Scott is the director, and he hasn't had a good film for ages (no, not even \\"Gladiator\\".) Jerry Bruckheimer has bad enough judgment to produce cash cows like \\"Pearl Harbor\\" (and that's a train wreck big enough to destroy anyone's career.) The cast, while featuring some good actors, is not exactly stellar. I was convinced I wouldn't see the film after seeing the trailer (the dialogue struck me as incredibly poor). But somehow I found myself seeing it, and boy was I surprised when I discovered the most riveting, unsettling war film since \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". <br />The time is October 3, 1993; the place is Somalia. 120 American soldiers were on a mission to capture lieutenants of warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a portrait of how what was supposed to be a half-hour mission turned into a grueling, 18 hour ordeal that led hundreds of Somalis and 18 Americans to their deaths. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is amazing in how it puts you right in a soldiers shoes. It doesn't speechify or go heavy on irony. The event is depicted through actions, not words, and the result is stunning. We see each little decision that was made, each step that went wrong, and how it all lead to tragedy. Watching \\"Black Hawk Down\\", I felt like I was actually a soldier in combat, and it was terrifying. <br />It is important to remember that this film isn't about the politics and the reasoning behind the mission, but about the experience. There is no trying to justify the reasons why things happened like they did. At times, it seems the screenplay (written by Ken Nolan and Steven Zaillian) wants to go that route, but Ridley Scott won't let it. We don't get to know the characters, but the idea of the film is that you are one of them. \\"Black Hawk Down\\" differs from films like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in that it isn't so much about the soldiers lives and their legacies, but more the terror of being shoved into circumstances beyond your control. <br />Scott has regained his title of one of the most visually brilliant directors around, after losing it with films like \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Hannibal\\". Anyone can make a film gory, few people are clear-headed enough to make it realistic. \\"Enemy at the Gates\\", for example, gives us a good look at Russian soldiers being mowed down by German machine guns, but the film is such a blur that it's impossible to care for them. In \\"Black Hawk Down\\", a sense of urgency is constantly pushing the film forward. Every time Scott cuts to a wide-angle shot to show the incoming enemy, it will get the entire audience tense. But as soon as he brings you back down into the action, the tenseness turns into horror. At times it feels almost impossible to watch, but it is just as hard to turn away. <br />There is the issue of the treatment of the Somalis in \\"Black Hawk Down\\". It's a sticky subject. I won't pretend that most of the Somalis aren't being treated as the enemy. But I will say that the film is not overly unfair. This is a film about battle, told from one side's point of view. If this were a story about the Somalis, then the Americans would be just as much the \\"bad guys\\". But this is battle, plain and simple, and no matter which way one looks at it, its barbaric. What would be unfair is if the film assumed it knew the other side's every thought and tried to simplify their story. This was done to the Japanese in \\"Pearl Harbor\\" with disastrous results. <br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a visceral film that shook me down to the core. It doesn't try to tell the political and moral complications behind all the chaos, which are far too vast and incomprehensible for any film to grasp. Film is a visual medium, and so Ridley Scott keeps the speechifying to a minimum and with his camera puts us in the middle of one of the biggest travesties since the Vietnam War.

0792833686|5.0|This is the greatest musical ever made, making fun of the very industry these people work in.  It's wonderful!  For those of you disappointed that there is no widescreen, Singin' in the Rain was not filmed in widescreen.  Cinemascope and other widescreen processes were not used all the time until the middle fifties, so this film is meant to be and remains in full frame.  Sorry to those expecting more, but it was filmed in and remains in 1.33:1 ratio and is still as beautiful as ever.
0553208845|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read, next to Catcher in the Rye. Steppenwolf is on one of my next books list. I usually hate reading, but that was a great book because it dealt with the deeper meaning in life and made you think. It also made you realize how you can only be happy with simple things and with whatever makes YOU happy. It also deals with the fact that although there may be obstacles in your path, you must always follow your true destiny to uncover your Nirvana. 10/10!
B00003CX5P|2.0|A mediocre begining to the Star Wars saga. It seems like it is aimed at children too much for adults to care about it.  Also missing is the sharp irreverance that the first films had.  Lucas' dialogue reads like it is to be acted with the same importance of Shakespears.  Even more offensive is the Steppin'-Fetchit Jar-Jar Binks.  A character that is so annoying you hope that he gets killed off.  Soon.  Please.  What the film really lacks is a strong, menacing evil figure (similar to Darth Vader) to contrast the good.  The evil in the film is almost amibigously dull.  Overall, nice special effects but a cardboard story.

B0000042H4|5.0|This is it.  Search no more.  You may, as I do, have eclectic tastes and find it difficult to narrow down an answer for people asking you &quot;what's your favorite CD?&quot;  But it's pretty hard to find anything that compares to the experience of Solti's cycle.  Little touches, such as the striking anvil in the forge, are the only distraction from the MELOdrama that is this soundscape.  And by melodrama, I do not mean screaming heft-maidens throwing their girths onto divans and wailing; I mean that our facile human dilemmas are metaphorically painted into large invasions of sound and emotion.  Wagner creates worlds with his music.  If all those Lord of the Rings and Star Wars junkies would strain to be just a little more cerebral, they would find here a treasure trove of fantastical, imperialistic, frightening, and provocative aural philosophy.
0553579908|5.0|I always enjoyed the idea of an epic fantasy, where the author could create a world and characters that are much more in depth than in a normal novel, yet I never could really get into any enough to put the time in.  I read the first Wheel of Time book and the first Dune book (Sci-Fi is close enough to fantasy), and enjoyed them both, but not enough to put my time into reading the rest of the series.<br />But when I read A Game of Thrones, I was absolutely hooked.  The day I finished it, I went out and got A Clash of Kings and read it more quickly than I've ever read a 1,000 page book.  Both of these books are absolutely amazing.  I'll let you get the reasons from other reviews (that's basically how I came upon the series), but I just wanted to say from the point of someone who is NOT a big fan of this genre, these are still some of the best books I have ever read.  I can't wait for the next one to come out in paperback next month, so I can go get it!  If you want to only read one series, THIS IS THE ONE!!!<br />I haven't read as much as many people that will read this, but of the 40 or so books that I have read, this is the only one that I felt compelled to write a review on.  Again, I don't want to reiterate all the good points of these books (and there are many), but I just wanted to say that I'm glad I finally found a fantasy series that is truly worth the time investment that they all take.

0066620996|5.0|I have a hard time making it through this book simply because I am rereading pages multiple times.  I don't work for a large company such as those studied in the book, but I found the description of how to focus one's business to be priceless.  I also have benefitted from the concept of a 'stop doing' list, as a foil to the 'to do' list that has too often overwhelmed me.  Unlike rah rah management books this one relies on fact -- a large helping of fact -- garnered from a lengthy and presumably costly process of interviewing thousands of executives in great and not so great companies.  If I could pick one book to read in 2002.... this would be it.
6305810109|5.0|The quotation from Lynch in the soundtrack lets you know what you've been thinking all along: that David Lynch intends this to be taken both sincerely and ironically. <br />Priceless, if for no other reason than the unforgettable last few seconds with Harry Dean Stanton.
0823003035|5.0|Tony Ryder's book is, hands down, superior on the market, both in terms of his extraordinary illustrations and beatuifully articulated text. In my experience, it is uncommon to find both done equally well. Although Ryder's examples are specific to portrait and figurative work,the pronciples of careful observation are relevant to every subject matter. <br />While there are many art-related texts on the market today, there are painfully few devoted to drawing, which is amazing to me, since it is the underpinning of every aspect of representational art.<br />This book is as absolute for every serious artist's bookshelf.

0780626966|5.0|There are the big bad three in modern horror. I'm talking about Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and then there is the one and only Freddy Krueger. There had never been a character quite like him before or a series of films like it before. Horror master turned the horror genre on it's head when he reinvented the genre with his classic 1984 screamer, &quot;A Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;. The movie was brilliantly scary, clever, gory, and was one of the most influential films in horror history. All of those things that made the original what it is was sorta lost on subsequent sequels, until Part &quot;New Nightmare&quot; in 1994. Even the other sequels had great direction and make-up and effects. The casts were always above average for a horror film. Nightmare 2 really went a few rungs down the ladder from the original. It did delve more into Freddy's history a little bit, but managed to do little else. Mark Patton as the terrorized kid did a good job of going nuts tho. Too bad Craven didn't do this. Nightmare 3 really got things back on track. Heather Langenkamp and John Saxon return from the original for this stylish, clever, slick film that's a real crowd pleaser. Nightmare 4 was the beginning of a different Freddy. He became more in the light and fired off the one liners right and left. I liked Part 4, but a lot of people didn't. Nightmare 5 was pretty bland. Like 2, it went into more of Freddy's history. That's always a plus. It was still well directed and very stylish, but pretty bland. Freddy's role could've been considered a cameo. &quot;Freddy's Dead&quot; was an interesting idea. It had the most insight in Freddy's life. The best history shown in a Freddy movie. The movie was pretty mediocre, but above most sequels. You gotta give the filmmamers credit. Lastly, we come to &quot;Wes Craven's New Nightmare&quot;. Craven returns 10 years later to the thing he created and got it back on track. This film is incredibly intelligent, very clever, and as slick and polished as a good thriller can be. Craven and company brought Freddy back in an ingenious way. The sets and art direction were fantastic. What a triumph!. The heart of these movies is actor Robert Englund. He has joined Lugosi, Karloff, Chaney, Cushing, and Lee in the 'horror icon' category. He is a fantastic actor with great presence and incredible charisma. The extra features here are all good. Even &quot;Freddy's Dead&quot; is shown with the 3-D ending with 3-D glasses!. It also comes with a commemorative book. There is an extra DVD here that includes a whole bunch of goodies. Interviews with casts and directors, trailers, music videos, trivia, screenplays, and some more!. This is the total package people!. If you need the Elm Street adventures in your collection, this is the essential piece you need. And after watching these, remember this - Whatever you do, don't....fall....asleep....
B000002I25|5.0|Ahead of it's time. A magical bond between music, lyrics, and vocals. Amazingly, The Doors completed this entire album in under two weeks. They all arrived one night to record what would be &quot;The End&quot;. They lit several candles next to each other's places and as the studio's illumination was dimmed, they began recording. &quot;The End&quot; was captured in just two takes. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; became an anthem for it's generation. All cuts on this album are essential, so break on thru to the Soul Kitchen, riding in our crystal ship, spotting a 20th-century fox, from one whisky bar to the next, man, we should take the back door and take it easy as it comes before we reach the end of the night. <br />&quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.&quot;<BR>-William Blake
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I am still laughing about this movie, even though I saw it several days ago! I have never seen a film that makes simple-mindedness, male modeling and the fashion industry so entertaining. <BR>This is easily Ben Stiller's most hilarious offering. Through mind-numbingly idiotic international male supermodel Derek Zoolander, Stiller both skewers and winks at the world's modeling/fashion industry.<BR>The plot: As the Malaysian Prime Minister prepares to raise wages for his country's impoverished workers, the powerful fashion magnates who rely on cheap labor prepare to strike back. Fashion designer Mugatu is ordered to dispose of the prime minister via an extremely dimwitted patsy, who comes along in the form of  Derek Zoolander. <BR>Zoolander becomes the perfect candidate when he looses VH1's Male Model Of The Year Award to archrival Hansel (Owen Wilson), and becomes disillusioned with the fashion industry. But, that's nothing an orange flavored coffee drink cant fix! Life is like a video for Zoolander, whether carousing with similarly dimwitted friends, working in a coal mine or facing down archrivals in back-alley 'walk-offs'. <BR>Words cannot describe the entertainment value of seeing Derek Zoolander, male supermodel, working in a coal mine with his father (jon Voight), played strangely like Christopher Walken. I almost fell off the couch.<BR>There are few genuinely smart characters in this film, but their presences only serve to make the rediculous heroes (and villains) more hilarious. Christina Taylor plays Zoolander's love interest, an intellectual reporter with Time magazine who finds out about the plot to destroy the Malaysian P.M. Jerry Stiller plays the soft-hearted owner of Balls Models, a reluctant participant in Mugatu's scheme. Finally, Saturday Night Live's outrageous Will Ferrell plays Mugatu, the evil fashion designer who programs Zoolander to do the dirty deed. I don't understand how any of the cast made this movie-I would not have been able to keep astraight face.<BR>Most of the extras in this film are, were or can be associated with the modeling/fashion/entertainment industry. Some are mentioned by name, but you can catch others if you are careful and knowledgeable about such things.<BR>There is not enough space to gush about this movie. This is a simply a piece of comedic brilliance that should be seen to be believed.
6304510861|5.0|The best Bowie track off of \\"Outside\\" provides bookends for this story within a story within a story within...<br />Were you to really unravel the plot, you would arrive at an endlessly repeating maelstrom of a doppelganger porn gorefest with slight variations on character.  The valium-fogged padding around in Lynch's hideous LA house sets a pace that is frustratingly engrossing.  And Richard Pryor runs a garage.<br />After the fourth or fifth trip out to the cabin in the sand, one welcomes the death of most of the leads as a cathartic end to the increasingly inane intrigue.  But how can you not love 2 Patricia Arquettes?  AND Gary Busey as a tearful, Zen, motorcycling suburban dad?
B00005JKJA|3.0|You can't forward to a scene which would be helpful for a movie like this.  The insert has 10 \\"clues\\" to help fans figure out this movies complex layers but they create more questions than they answer.  <BR>I can't stand that it is a beautiful widescreen print which they censor during the lesbian love scene.  No commentary, no documentary, only a trailor and filmography for 4 people in the movie.  Blue Velvet is being rereleased with some bonus stuff, perhaps they are planning to do the same for this DVD.  Come on David Lynch, give us something besides a \\"clue\\" to look for coffee cups.
1559408898|4.0|Made in 1987, this film paints a rather bleak picture of the future in its depiction of the escalation of crime in a major metropolitan area (in this case, the city of Detroit), but whats really disconcerting watching it now is the fact that the reality of today seems to be catching up and closing in on this fictional future all too quickly.  And its a scary proposition when you think about it, which makes Robocop, an action/drama directed by Paul Verhoeven, something of a cautionary tale, as well as engrossing entertainment.<br /> Alex Murphy (Peter Weller) is a veteran police officer, newly assigned to crime infested Old Detroit, which is about to undergo a major renovation.  Plans are on the board for a multi-million dollar new city, but first the vermin who control the present city have to be eliminated.  Toward that end, OCP, the major corporation apparently controlling just about everything (including the police department), are about to unveil a new kind of policeman, that will make the Murphys of the force nothing more than support units.  What theyre proffering is an ominous looking robot, the Ed-209, touted by OCP Vice President Dick Jones (Ronny Cox) as the law enforcement of the future.<br /> An up-and-comer with OCP, Bob Morton (Miguel Ferrer), has ideas of his own, however, that involve a project hes been trying to implement that would feature yet a different kind of future cop.  And when a demonstration of Ed-209 goes awry, Morton makes his move, pitching his plan to The Old Man (Dan OHerlihy), the CEO of OCP.  Murphy, meanwhile, on his first day of duty in Old Detroit, is brutally gunned down and killed (or is he?) by a gang of criminals lead by one Clarence Boddicker (Kurtwood Smith).  Bad for Murphy, good for Morton, however, who proceeds to turn Murphy into a prototype of his vision of the future of law enforcement.  Enter Robocop, half human, all cyborg.  Good for Detroit, bad for criminals, especially Boddicker and his gang.  Because somewhere deep inside of whats left of Murphy, is a glimmer of memory.  And Boddickers face was the last thing he ever saw.<br /> Going into this project, Verhoeven definitely had a vision of what he wanted this film to be.  That vision was dark and violent, and he succeeded in bringing it to fruition, in grand and graphic style.  The finished product is extremely violent and at times unpleasant to watch; but its also riveting filmmaking, and quite effective.  it works because Verhoeven gives you more than just a gore-fest; despite the graphic violence (the scene in which Murphy is gunned down, for example, is beyond brutal), he keeps the human element at the heart of the story.  He never lets you forget that beneath all that armor there is-- or was-- a man.  And he gives you just enough background of Murphys personal life to make you care about him, and it makes what happens to him all the more disturbing.  On the other side of the coin, his villains are despicable, and you get to a point where you cant wait for Robocop to mete out the justice they so readily deserve.  Verhoevens presentation is solid and cohesive, perfectly complementing the action with the drama, which affords the audience a satisfying cinematic experience.  And quite an experience it is.<br /> In a challenging role, Peter Weller succeeds in his portrayal of this man-turned-machine; in lesser hands, Robocop may have been nothing more than a machine with a bit of flesh beneath the metal, but Weller plays to the man inside, rather than the machine that encases him, and it makes a huge difference in the way the character is perceived.  Wellers performance enables the audience to become emotionally involved with the Murphy he presents, rather than offering just a soulless Robocop, which from an action standpoint would have been fine, but would have diminished the drama and the overall impact of the film.  Obviously, this is something Verhoeven and Weller realized, and in the final analysis, it was their collaboration and like-minded approach to the character that made this film really work.  <br /> Another interesting aspect of this film is that there are three significant villains, each plying their own unique brand of treachery, and all effectively presented by the actors portraying them.  Cox epitomizes the unscrupulous corporate executive, who cares less about the service or product he can provide than the bottom line,  while Ferrers Morton is an insufferable snake.  The worst of the bunch, however, is Smiths Boddicker, the kind of villain you love to hate, but who is also unsettling upon reflection, as his outward appearance so subtly masks what a truly evil individual he is.  You hate to think that there are really people like this walking around free in the world.  <br /> Also turning in memorable performances are Nancy Allen, as Murphys partner, Anne Lewis; Ray Wise, as Leon Nash, one of Boddickers bunch; and Paul McCrane, as Emil, another of Boddickers men (McCrane is especially good at creating characters you despise, as he does with his portrayal here, and currently as Dr. Romano is TVs ER).<br /> The supporting cast includes Robert DoQui (Sergeant Reed), Felton Perry (Johnson), Jesse D. Goins (Joe), Del Zamora (Kaplan), Calvin Jung (Minh), Rick Lieberman (Walker), Lee de Broux (Sal), Mark Carlton (Miller) and Edward Edwards (Manson).  Hard-edged, thought-provoking, visceral entertainment, Robocop is a film you may have to steel yourself a bit for, but its well made and delivered, and ultimately, a mesmerizing cinematic experience that far exceeds the typical action genre formula.  Its violent, but then again, so is real life; and this is one of Lifes stories.
B000002AGN|5.0|Even if you've never purchased this CD, you may well have already heard it and enjoyed it. As a baby-boomer, some of my earliest memories in the early 60's are of the sounds of &quot;Blue Rondo..&quot; and the rest coming from the hi-fi in the living room while my parents sipped cocktails with the neighbors. The West-coast cool jazz of the period flourished because it was accessible and didn't demand (although it deserved) the full attention of its audience; hence it was also great background music for suburban cocktail parties on lazy weekends. That's not a slam; it's just a practical observation. <BR>This music has an important place in American history; it speaks of the vigorous new courage and affluence of our nation at that time. I bought my own LP copy when I was in college, largely because of sentimentality. Then I really LISTENED to it. I haven't stopped listening for more than 20 years.<BR>People who are much more enthusiastic about Jazz than I am, tend to dismiss the conventional overtones in West-coast music and &quot;Time Out&quot; (even as the album pioneered new time signatures--whatever the heck that really means). But it is elegant in its simplicity, its mellow, its cool, and it is certainly not conventional. No, Brubeck didn't set the stage for the Jazz that came later, in the way Miles did, but he was a master of what he did and it shows here. <BR>Is this a great introduction to modern jazz for the beginner? Probably not. As broad as my tastes are, I still get lost in the more progressive jazz that followed in the 70s. What it is, though, is great music, period. Buy it.
0380973464|3.0|Cryptonomicon can't decide what it wants to be: a crypto primer ? A historical documentary ? An adventure story ? The one thing it never actually accomplishes is being a book with a real plot and characters. Yes, if I wanted to compare some books on the history of encryption, Cryptonomicon would probably win; but we are discussing fiction books here. I have seen a lot worse though, hence the 3 stars. For a real technothriller, I recommend Acts of the Apostles, by John F. X. Sundman.

1577311523|5.0|While many spend a lifetime meditating in order to fully experience creation, mind transcendence is somehow uncloaked in a flash of Tolle's genius resembling the Guru's touch. No ego there, just a pure mind and spirit laying down truth's profound simplicity.  Tolle's book does not chart yet another arduous path to higher consciousness, but a freeway to enlightenment on which you can put the top down and the pedal to the metal.  He is an excellent navigator who shows the attentive reader how fully to arrive at the best of all destinations -- the present moment. Like many others, I recommend buying a half dozen extra copies for friends. God, thanks for Eckhart Tolle!

B00005RY7X|4.0|First things first... this is NOT sophisticated music, nor does it pretend to save the world, or aspire to create... ANYTHING! This is, rather, moronic kegger-party music which, paradoxically, will on the one hand be dated almost as soon as it hits your local radio station, yet on the other hand, is almost timeless in its joyful celebration of what Rock 'N Roll USED to be... The \\"founding fathers\\" (i.e. Little Richard, everybody at Sun Records, Chuck Berry, Gene Vincent, Fats Domino) simply wanted to, much like lunkhead Andrew's statement of purpose, \\"Party Hard\\"... There were hardly any artistic pretensions in popular music until Dylan plugged into the mainstream in 1965 and the Beatles and Beach Boys tried to keep up with this newfound aural and lyrical sophistication. Yes, all of those artists were, in fact, VEEERY talented... Andrew IS NOT, by any means, \\"talented\\", but his music IS organic, made by people who play their own instruments and \\"write\\" (if you could call this \\"writing\\") their own music. It's joyful and, as I said, \\"organic\\", so I would rather listen to it than any of the drivel MTV... but as far as mainstream, video-driven Rock 'N Roll, this takes the cake... eats it in 1989, and pukes it 2002.<br />Here's to hoping Andrew W.K. beats the stuffing out of Scott \\"J.C. Superstar\\" Crapp, of Creed.
B00005JKQX|4.0|\\"Beautiful Mind\\" has a lot going for it: Russell Crowe's great performance, a compelling story line, strong direction, good score etc. It probably also deserved the Oscar of the films that were up for nomination. Even though I liked this movie a lot, it bugged me that I wasn't seeing the absolute truth. It appears  that Hollywood  feels that they have to manipulate the stories they film- have a feel-good ending-add Hollywood gloss etc.etc. ala \\"The Player\\" I just wish they trusted us to be interested in the facts as they stand. I don't feel that distorting the truth, as they have in this film, makes a better movie. It insults our intelligence by assuming that we value entertainment (a formulaic entertainment, at that) over the real, truly interesting stories of real people. They could have avoided the distortion  in \\"a Beautiful Mind\\" and instead of a great film we, instead, end up  with a film that's merely a pretty good one. Still you should see it- there is still plenty to like and I recommend it.

They probaly popped this in and got a big suprise.  People say that it is a Goodfellas clone.  Goodfellas isn't nearly as ferocious as Casino.  This is De Niro at his best.  This is my favorite Scorsese film and mabye my favorite film of all time.  I think the narration is very creative.  The point is that if you are like the people that I described above, don't write reveiws for this movie that destroys its rep.  (Jerry Vale Rules!)
B00005RY7X|5.0|A lot of people are wondering why this music is getting such great reviews. Its because the hard rock of today is terrible. Its all terribly overproduced, very overdramatic, shallow, pompous and stupid. Want examples? Well the list goes on forever: stained, p.o.d., incubus, papa roach, creed, 3 doors down, kid rock, dirt, blood, linkin park, whatever, etc.etc.etc. I could go on forever. First of all don't take these guys seriously, they very smart and know exactly what there doing. They are making fun of all the terrible music that I have just mentioned. They are making fun of the \\"ohhh!!! yea!! my life's terrible!!! so sad and lonely!!! oh yea I forgot I from the suburbs and my life really isn't that bad because I'm rich!!!!!!\\" I think these guys have a whole lot more substance than \\"Linkin Park\\" for example because they aren't drama queens.  I personally can't stand much of the music today. I listen to a lot of British, Indy and progressive music and this cd makes sense because its an \\"in your face\\" to the pop rock thats going on today. Eat you heart out creed.
630280082X|5.0|...Crossroads is the story of aspiring Blues guitarist, and current classical<BR>guitar student at the Julliard School of Music, Eugene Martone. Eugene<BR>worships the blues and is constantly getting in trouble for this with his,<br />more learned, teachers. Through a lot of research Eugene finds that a<BR>genuine Blues Harp (harmonica) man has been put in the local prison<BR>hospital. <BR> With a bit of subterfuge Eugene is able to get a job there and meets<BR>Willie Brown who initially wants nothing to do with this young pup. Finally<BR>Willie sees a use for this boy and agrees to teach him the lost music of<BR>legend, Robert Johnson, in exchange for Eugene busting him out of the<BR>hospital and taking him down to his home in Mississippi.<BR> Eugene reluctantly does this and then much to his horror finds that<BR>they don't have the money necessary to get them to Mississippi. Willie<BR>scoffs at Eugene's protests and states that if he is really a blues man then<BR>they will have no problems hoboing across country. They do this and at first<BR>Eugene is horrified especially at the lack of food and the lack of<BR>shelter...and the occasional death threats. But after he begins to feel the<BR>music course through his soul and learns about love on the road he begins to<BR>appreciate hoboing and old Willie more and more.<BR> Finally they reach Mississippi and Willie begins asking if anyone<BR>knows about the crossroads because he has to meet someone there. All along<BR>he keeps putting off Eugene about the lost songs of Robert Johnson. Willie<BR>finally tells Eugene the reason they are going to the crossroads is that he<BR>has to meet a man that he long ago made a deal with...a deal for his soul in<BR>exchange for the music. Eugene blows up at this and accusing the old man of<BR>running scam after scam on him.<BR> When a black car appears out of nowhere and the two are transported<BR>to a raucous dance hall, Eugene shuts up. Willie pleads his case to another<BR>old man that shows up and is told no deal. Eugene, being young and<BR>disbelieving, steps in on Willie's side and is suddenly facing a choice. He<BR>can participate in a \\"Head-Cutting\\" contest, a little see if you can top<BR>this musical contest, with the hard rock guitar playing wild-man that is<BR>there. If he wins, Willie is free. If he looses...both their souls are<BR>forfeit. <BR> Walter Hill has to have a love of music in his soul. He directs this<BR>movie with the slow easy feeling of the Blues running through the majority<BR>of it yet also knows when to kick in the hard edge of rock to move the pace<BR>along. His visuals in the South bring back memories of magnolia, kudzu, and<BR>a sleeper time of life.<BR> Ralph Macchio plays the cynical Eugene perfectly. We have seen him<br />more than once as the New Yorker thrown into the South and he manages the<BR>fish out of water context perfectly. He also manages to fake playing the<BR>guitar well enough when it is focused on him that it isn't insulting to<BR>musicians watching the piece.<BR> Obviously though, the key here is the music. Ry Cooder is<BR>responsible for the majority of the score and it would be harder to find a<BR>more accomplished guitarist. He knows the blues and can switch into the<BR>classical styling with no threat to the continuity of the performance. The<BR>Devil's guitarist is played by rock legend, Steve Vai. The duel between<BR>Steve and a Ry Cooder influenced Eugene is a treat for the ears. It comes<BR>across as a visual \\"Devil went down Georgia\\" and shows both the agony and<BR>ecstasy that music can bring to people. I strongly recommend this one.
B00005RFAI|5.0|pink's 2nd cd, m!ssundaztood, is really good.  it's the kind of album that you can discover tracks on; a few weeks ago i found out how great \\"lonely girl\\" was, when i wasn't attracted to it the first few seconds i'd listened to it before.  so here's how i graded the songs again:<br />1) m!ssundaztood- a nice, airy feel to this feel-good song. A<br />2) don't let me get me- a rock song, but way too short. A<br />3) just like a pill- i like how it changes swiftly from a simple guitar to a powerful rock track. A+<br />4) get the party started- how overplayed is this one. B+<br />5) respect- not really any different than #4. A-<br />6) 18-wheeler- a rock song that is also uplifting and feel-good. A+<br />7) family portrait- meaningful lyrics don't do anything to this sort of blah-sounding work. B+<br />8) misery- flowed into this by family portrait, we hear jazz and pop, and not really good vocals. B+<br />9) dear diary- good beginning but it doesn't go anywhere. A-<br />10) eventually- a different-sounding style for pink is just<BR>ok. B<br />11) lonely girl- a good song but you can tell that pink didn't write the lyrics even without looking in the lyrics packet.

B00005NWM3|1.0|Not really though, because I would never buy this band's garbage (music).  They're super bad and super generic.  But I bet Roadrunner is happy that they finally have another big hit after Slipknot's 'Wait and Bleed' Remix.  Woohoo for them.  But unfortunately for people with functioning eardrums, it's another story.  And the other story is sad.  Nickelback is just another slue of bands jumping on the alternative train.  Other such examples are as followed: Puddle of Mudd, Default, and Staind.  Like the aforementioned bands, Nickelback is very bad.  Once again we have a band playing the same guitar riffs with virtually the same beats as all those other alternative bands.  Accompanied by bland and uninspired lyrics.  This type of stuff is pretty sickening if you ask me.  And what's even more sickening is that people buy into this horrible &quot;music&quot;.  I want it all to go away, so take your nickel back.  No one with any musical integrity should want it.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; is a wonderful upbeat song that makes me want to dance.  &quot;Respect&quot; is the same.  &quot;Family Portrait&quot; is sad, but it makes me thankful for the type of family that I have.Since I am a BIG Aerosmith fan, I have to say that &quot;Misery&quot; is one of my favorites.  Steven Tyler is really great.  This cd is a must have!  It will make you experience feelings you didn't know you had.  At least it did for me.
B00005YW4H|5.0|like so many on this site, i have a tendency to be skeptical of anyone compared to billie or proclaimed to have &quot;the best voice in the past twenty years&quot; or &quot;she's only 22&quot; or (insert overly sensational complement here).  but listen to the cd.  if you only listen to old school rap, you might not like this cd.  if you only listen to pop (brittney, nsync, etc) you might not like this cd.  and if you are an incredibly snobby jazz purist (and i've recommended this cd to some pretty snobby folks who've loved it) you might not like this cd, because every song on it was not first produced in the fifties or earlier (though some were) and there is no brass section.  her style overlaps a lot of genres--jazz, folk, blues, even (gasp) country.  but wow, guys.  what a voice.  unique--she's not mariah, janis or ella she's something new and different, creating her own niche just like each of the three above did.
0451191153|5.0|We live in an age where tradition is scoffed and ideas are irrelevant, yet Rand masterfully shows in this novel how she works out her philosophy in real life.  <br />I certainly didn't always agree with her philosophy, yet the book encaptures the imagination and lets you disagree with her and at the same time still love the book.<br />A MUST READ!...
B000065U1N|1.0|This was a movie that was created to be the most PC and pleasing movie of the year. THe characters were unbeleivible, with stupid antics to make shots at jokes during the movies. THe main character was the perfect boyscout who loved all races and was there to save lives, i dont doubt that the men and women in service do this but he was just too much the perfect human being without any faults. The movie was also too repetitive, i would of loved to pay 1/4 the price and have seen 30 mins, but instead it seemed they took thirty minutes of footage and put it on a loop.
B00005QCVT|5.0|I just watched Requiem for a Dream for the first time. It touched me more than any other piece of art ever has in my life. I am a drug addict, now in recovery. ... Nothing I have ever experienced in my life has been able to just...God, there are no words for how this movie has touched me. The acting was incredible. The way it was shot was incredible. Nothing has ever been able to capture drug addiction and manifest the feelings that a drug addict goes through everyday the way this movie has. The most incredible movie I have ever seen. Maybe just because I can relate to it.
0786882212|5.0|There are two reasons to pick up John Hodge's screenplay for \\"Trainspotting,\\" based on the novel by Irvine Welsh.  The first is because you have trouble understand English spoken with strong Scottish brogues and you cannot figure out how to use closed captioning.  Admittedly, this is the minor reason.  The second and major reason is to appreciate how well Hodge transformed Welsh's novel into a solid screenplay.  After all, the novel was a collection of loosely related short stories about several different characters that neither aspires to nor reaches a complete narrative form.  Also, the key to the characters comes as much from their internal monologues as it does from anything they say or do.  Of course the solution was to focus on one character and make him the \\"narrator\\" of the film.  This becomes Mark Renton, the unrepentant drug abuser who does not seem to be as hell-bent on self-destruction as the rest of his mates.<br />This volume includes an introduction by Hodge, who explains how he came to be coerced into writing the screenplay.  The screenplay is indeed the screenplay, and not a transcript of the film, so there are plenty of changes in dialogue and editing if you actually do sit down and follow along while watching Danny Boyle's film.  Notations tell you want scenes or bits of dialogue were cut from the film and there are plenty of black & white photographs of the various scenes (but just Ewen McGregor coming OUT of the toilet...).  The Afterword consists of a brief interview with author Irvine Welsh, conducted during the penultimate week of the shooting of the film (Welsh was doing a cameo performance as the drug dealer Mikey Forrester).  Welsh speaks candidly about the transformation of his novel into a film and how the drug scene in Scotland has changed since the book's original publication.  However, for those who have actually tracked down and read the novel, reading the screenplay soon afterwards will give you a greater appreciation of how excellent a job Hodges did with this adaptation.nt a job Hodges did with this adaptation.
B000002A3T|5.0|There is no doubt that Pink Floyd is one of the greatest bands  of the world. I think that only a few people know what music really is, therefore, when someone says that Pink Floyd stopped being the same when Waters left the band, as a matter of fact, he doesn't even know what Pink Floyd really means.<br />David Gilmour really changed the band for better, there is no doubt that Waters was always a sort of shadow that never let the band get better than it was.<br />Division Bell is the plain proof that Pink Floyd is now quite better than it was once, thus, Waters already knows that Gilmour overcome him indeed, Pink Floyd was and will always be something incredible and wonderful thanks to Gilmour now ahead.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Not only is this one of the greatest car races, it just happens to be filmed durning the most important climax in Porcshe automotive history.<br /><br />Porsche had been working on winning the World Championship and had been focusing on making the ulimate race car. The 908s just did not have what it takes against the big Ford GT40s, but when the rules changes to 5 liters - Porsche had been working on the 917 which would rule over the next couple of years.<br /><br />Steve McQueen was at the right place at the right time. He was heavily into racing and was about to race in the Le Mans in a Porsche 908. He had just finished the 12hrs at Seabring, in second place - just barely losing to Mario Andretti in the Ferrari 512, which was meant to compete with the 917. Steve shocked the motor world with his placing in Seabring. He was not the typical actor to race driver - it was more the other way around.<br /><br />That year (1970) the film company refused to let him race again, even though LeMans was his dream.<br /><br />But most amazingly, Steve did what no other person had done before. The movie of LeMans has some actual footage of the 1970 LeMans race, as well as the real drivers.<br /><br />Steve had a Porsche 908 entered in the race with a front and rear film cameras mounted onto the car. It was an officail race entry. What is even more amazing the 908 camera car finished 8th overall - it had completed the race, while having to make twice as many stops to reload film.<br /><br />After filming 24hrs of car footage from the race - almost all in car. Steve had to rap a movie around it. He kept it a pure race movie. The whole movie is the race, except for 10 minutes in the begining. Other then the GT40 of Jackie Ickx beating the 908 of Hermann in 1969 by a matter of seconds, only does the movie Le Mans have an equally exciting finish.<br /><br />I have seen several Le Mans Races on TV and video and I actually went last year to see the Audis take it again (2001), but except for the 1999 LeMans (Mercedes flipping) the movie Le Mans captures the excitment and a bit of important history.<br />This movie could also be called GULF 917 vs Ferrari 512!<br /><br />If you are a Porsche fan, a sports car history buff, Le Mans fan, or just like car racing - this is it.<br /><br />(If you are into auto racing - specially the pinicle years of 69 - 73 check out the movie \\"The Speed Merchants\\" it is hosted by Mario and Elford - it covers the 72 Sports Car Championship, and has LeMans, Targa Florio, Seabring and more - more of a documentary.

0783229364|5.0|I remember watching this movie over and over again, since it came out in 1987. I find myself still watching  it and its the year 2002. I always liked movies w/ Michael J. Fox.
B000002HMH|5.0|This album is amongst Metallicas best. The older albums are great being heavy. ... This album isnt as fast as those old albums, but it is very heavy, and very diverse. The music covers a wider range and every song is great. Highlights include Bleeding Me, House that Jack Built, Until it Sleeps, King Nothing, Hero of the Day and Thorn Within. The guitar solos are really cool in this album too. Not as fast as the old metallica, but very creative and bluesy. Hetfields lyrics are also much more personal and words you can relate to, and his singing is very free. Great album, must have for true fans
B00005RIZP|4.0|A madman sneaks into a seriority house and terrorizes the people inside.<br />Great movie! I heard this movie was one of the movies to first use the &quot;The call is coming from inside the house&quot; bit; if it did, the movie's filmmakers pulled it off the bit brilliantly.<br />What I really liked about the movie was that the audience was prevented from seeing the killer's face; this left the audience guessing as to who the killer really was. In one scene, the camera is in front of the killer, but the killer's face is hidden in the dark; the only thing we really get a good look on are the killer's eyes (we would later see these eyes again later in the movie).<br />Probably the best part about this movie is the ending. The ending kind of makes you want a sequel.
B000060MY6|4.0|I don't know if I'm just naive about what he was trying to do when he directed this film. He would know more than I would what he wanted the viewer to come away with. I wanted to rent it again right after I returned it. It stimulated my brain thats why, and my libido. I thought that the lez-curious scene was very real and sensitive. My heart was beating so fast. Then people started disappearing, little Lilliputan characters were walking under doors, people were swithching identities... You will need a notepad to keep up with the names and who switched with whom. It was just like an episode of Twin Peaks, or even CSI. If you want to be stimulated in the brain and body watch it. Don't buy anything that cuts out scenes, (even the nude ones) because they really help to pull you into the characterizations. I will re-rent it just to break it down like a Shakespearean sonnet. I hope I can still enjoy it.
6305736650|5.0|no point exists in explaining why this movie is good. it just gets on another level, and plays with one's emotions. how many movies could do that?<br />perhaps my favorite scene out of any movie is when the german thugs are racuously singing a patriotic tune (probably deutschland uber alles... but it doesn't matter). victor lazlo, incensed, stands up and walks to the band leader, where he perfectly delivers a laconic line... &quot;PLAY LA MARSEILLAISE!&quot; eventually, the song starts out with just lazlo, and the germans are still heard. soon, everyone sings and drowns the germans out. the blonde girl (i don't remember her name) gets a close-up, and as we can plainly see, she is crying. she cries with frustration, rage, and vengeful pride. <br />seeing this scene chills me to the bone.
0385474547|5.0|Things Fall Apart is the first of the four African novels that I've read, and it struck me as a wonderful novel, concentrating more on the society more than character. Although the character development was thorough and in depth, the society becomes more important to the reader. Okonkwo is truly an intriguing character throughout the book, using his lazy father as a motivational device to be more than good in anything. Achebe stays true to the African perspective, but really is not biased in any way. It is for the reader to decide and determine their own feelings.
0812550706|4.0|This is probably one of the most well written books that I have ever read, very intruiging, and interesting. However despite the author's explanations in the beginning of the book, he does not manage to make the characters people. He obviously is trying to delve at emotions, and the like, but the characters come across without the genuine, human feel, that is needed for a sense of completion in any novel. A very good read, but the characters do not satisfy.
B00005JKED|4.0|Training Day was not one of Denzel's best films but he more than earned his Oscar just spanning his career he should've got it for Hurricane and Malcolm X ...  Anyway lot of folks out there think it wrongfully depicts cops as basically corrupt, anti-social, authoritarian parasites and really I've met many of those types in my very bad habit of driving while black but there are good cops out there and they are the norm.  This movie was very disturbing in the sense that people in a position of power and authority will more than likely abuse it and shamefully at that I mean police officers are human beings and given power and authority on certain levels can turn anybody into a sociopathic monster.  It's just terrifying to watch a character on screen that was so twisted morally and basically evil.  I was reminded of the pimp in Taxi Driver and for some strange reason that crazy guy who hardly said a word in Fargo.
6304535570|5.0|I have never seen one of Val Kilmer's movie's before.But I sure have since then.He is an excellent actor and there seemed to be real chemistry between him and Elizabeth Shue.So far I have watched it 8 times and plan on watching it many more.The action keeps you on your toes wondering what will come next,and the romance is really sweet.
B00005A46T|5.0|So bleak, so heavy, so cool. I have never heard anyone play music so loud and heavy, with just about every element of metal thrown in to it. It is very speedy, and is fueled almost entirely on ear splitting guitar and Joey Jordison's hardcore double bass drums. Joey can play the bass drums faster with his feet than many people can hit a desk with their hands, and he keeps it in perfect rythym, too! The bleakness of the music just adds to the intensity, but unfortunately, it is scream singing and growling down on a mic more than anything. Corey Taylor sings very rarely, but the screams are just something that allows for the music to build aggression.<br />#1: (515): Eerie sounds like something you would hear in Black Hawk Down or other war movies.<br />#2: People = Sh**: Very intense and profane, but is just a too-real song. 10/10<br />#3: Disasterpiece: Almost hypnotic, long, and tense. 9/10<br />#4: My Plague: Great, an awesome song, but quite bumpy. 8/10<br />#5: Everything Ends: OK, but not the best. 7/10<br />#6: The Heretic Anthem: Nothing but a big fight song, and not very good. 6/10<br />#7: Gently: Nothing but a big explosion of noise, but it sounds good. 9/10<br />#8: Left Behind: The 2nd best; a really great song, and Slipknot's classic. 11/10<br />#9: The Shape: Cool. I like very much. 10/10<br />#10: I Am Hated: Speedy, but it it very hard to understand. It is really an anthem telling people with problems to shut up. 9/10<br />#11: Skin Ticket: This sounds like ship labor music! 8/10<br />#12: New Abortion: Off-beat and cool. Not Slipknot at their best, however. 8/10<br />#13: Metabolic: AWESOME!... The best on the cd. It is really about Corey Taylor's rage against his bad dad. 12/10<br />#14: Iowa (Killers Are Quiet): Strange and scary. It sounds like something a stalker would sing. 9/10<br />This is the future of metal music as we know it. It is fueled' enraged, and well worth listening to. This Iowa bred group deserves all the great amount of attention they get.
B000060P79|5.0|In case you've never heard of Simple Plan before I suggest you give them a chance. If your into amazing pop punk bands like Good Charlotte, M.E.S.T., Blink 182 and so on. Then Simple Plan is definatly worth a listen. In fact, Good Charlotte fans would be pleased to know that Joel from Good Charlotte helped out with the album..or so I&quot;v heard. All in all it's a great CD and totally worth the buy.
B00005B36H|4.0|A cd this good doesnt come around very often. It is extremeley loud and crunchy, leading to a more impactful sound. The intensity is found after odd noise at the beginning of most tracks. The Grudge almost sounds like it begins in a dentist's office, then becomes an ear-bombing prog-metal song. Lateralis starts with a minute of seemingly senseless guitar, but leads to an amp-shattering noise that any metal fan will enjoy. The length of the songs is a problem, but it is worth dealing with. The booklet that comes with the cd is a mystery in itself, kind of like the Aenima cover with all of its holograms and bizarre imagery and text, and Undertow, which had a (sic...) sheet. The titles of these songs don't make sense either. Despite all of that senselessness thrown into the music, it comes out even better with it, because it just adds to the complexity, darkness, and the scare factor thrown in. This haunting cd it great for any metal fan, and Tool fans will not be dissapointed comparing to the classic Aenima.
B000060P79|5.0|Like many people around the world I bet you are looking for a musical group that you can relate to. Someone who sings about life as you see it. Life in general and how it feels to be \\"Just a kid\\" in today's society. If your looking for all that and more in a band. I would suggest to you to take a listen to Simple Plan. If you love bands like Good Charlotte,MxPx,M.E.S.T, and Blink 182. Then this pop punk band has been created for you. In fact for all you GC fans, I heard that Joel Madden actually lent his hand in helping with the CD. As well as Mark from Blink 182 , so if you call yourselves true fans of GC and Blink, you would totally support thier friends. So it has their stamp of approval and if it makes a difference to you it totally has mine. Simple Plan has just broken onto the big scene and it's up to you to make them last. They actually have songs that have meaning to them which is a breath of fresh air from all the worthless music circulating in our country today. \\"I'm just a kid\\" is their debut single which shot these boys straight up the chart. The songs on their album get better and better each track that plays.These amazing Canadians will show the world how great our country really is. Pick up a copy and support Simple Plan !!!
B000002JNJ|5.0|Pantera fuels all of what modern heavy music is. They make speed quite emphasized, and keep everything sound great (and brutal) at the same time. All of this music is expressed the way it should be, with the music put on top of the lyrics, not the other way around, like on many modern cds. (Hey, a lot of new cds are good, but these were the golden days). Pantera did the world a favor by making sure metal stayed alive in the 90's, when alternative rock took over. They are the greatest metal band of the 90's, and deserve more attention than they get today, which may unfortunately be because of their absence. This is their best album, ... The attention this album got was well deserved.
B00005QGAV|5.0|When this album was released in '91 I was just 6 years old and wanted my parents to buy me this after I had heard Black or White. Soon I became a massive MJ fan and discovered my parents had various other MJ or J5 cds. Late last year I stumbled across this cd which hadn't been listened to in a good 7-8 years. It has been a constant fixture in my cd player ever since. Words can't describe how good this album is. My personal favourites would have to be In The Closet, Remember The Time, Who Is It, Give In To Me and the bangin title track which finishes the album off. This was MJ at his innovative best taking over the music world as he seems to do every 4-5 years
B00005JKJA|5.0|I can't help but get a laugh out of all the people who are freaking out at the lack of chapter stops on the DVD.  Get over yourselves.  David Lynch says that movies aren't books, and shouldn't have chapters.  Just admire Mulholland Drive as pure cinematic acheivement.  The sound and picture are amazing.  The performances are astounding, and the story will make you want to view the DVD again and again.  Isn't that what great cinema is supposed to do?  If you can't get past the lack of &quot;Chapter Stops&quot;--maybe this isn't the film for you.
B00005B36H|5.0|If your just looking to expand your music collection, this album will bring you to a fork in the road:  buy it, and you won't need anything else.  Don't buy it, and you'll keep on buying... looking for what?  For THIS album.
0140186395|5.0|I loved this book. My favorite Steinbeck book (have read Of Mice and Men, Cannery Row, The Grapes of Wrath and The Moon is Down). I read The Grapes of Wrath just prior and I found Eden to be the better of the two. It was a book that I had trouble putting down. The characters were great.

6305327084|4.0|This movie is one of those true gems that no one I know had seen before suggesting it to.  Do yourself and relations a favor, go buy or rent this movie soon.<br />The cast is the best ensemble cast I have ever seen.  Each and every character works in the movie, there are no awkward or misplaced actors here, from beginning to end.  With the likes of Tim Hutton, Matt Dillon, Uma Thurman, Natalie Portman, Mira Sorvino, Noah Emmerich et al. all sharing the spotlight equally- make this the kind of movie you will enjoy wathching over and over.<br />It's 10 year high school reunion time in 'the ridge', a small, working class town that seems to keep most of its graduates in close proximity, except for Willie (Timothy Hutton) who ventured off to the big city as a musician after school.  His character plays a wonderful guide through the whole movie, undoubtedly the one that most viewers would best relate to.  We are taken by many of life's obstacles in this picture, albeit fairly small ones, but they are so much easier to see and understand than the large ones.  That is where I find most of the joy in this movie, in its confronting and questioning the challenges of adult life.<BR>Beautiful Girls is a 'smart' movie, but not so much that it becomes a burden to watch.  It makes you feel really comfortable really fast and immediately turns you into that unseen character that we all play while watching a movie.<br />After the acting, the hilarious script will keep you thinking about it long after viewing it.  It also has an INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK that you cannot miss that features some great indie and classic rock.<br />If your mood tells you to see a movie that is fun, talks to your soul, makes you sit back, relax and enjoy without any overt action or violence.....(well, almost none) then grab it and go!<br />My 4 out of 5 rating relates to the DVD, which includes NO special features or extras...too bad.<br />A great choice for older teenagers to the most mature!  They should evenenjoy watching it together.
B00003CY6M|3.0|Serendipity (2001), directed by<br /> Peter Chelsom<br />With John Cusack and Kate Beckingsale<br />No exactly a silly movie, or rather, a silly movie worth watching, but if you missed it you didn't miss much.  Let's put it this way: it was 91 nearly enjoyable minutes.<br />It's the story of two young people who meet at a Christmas gift shop (on Christmas Eve), and pretend they are married to a customer who wants to buy the same gift they want. After that--call it fate--they meet accidentally several times throughout the evening but then get separated for saver years--can you believe that?  When the story resumes its thread, they are in process of planning their own weddings with different persons, but we know this will never happens, because serendipity (whatever that weird word means) will bring them back together again, which it does.<br />That's actually it.  What makes the movie watchable is splendid photography, inventive mise-en-scene, camera movement, clever montages, good music (soundtrack), and especially the personalities of these two engaging young actors.  Especially Beckinsale, who played Emma, in one of Jane Austen's adaptations, and also was in Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado About Nothing (playing Hero, and very well).<br />The idea here, admittedly too New-Age-ish, is that the stars, and the signs, and the what-not, can bring people together, somehow, if they are destined to be. Coincidences play a role, and, in this case,  a five-dollar note is the clue that reveals the address of one of the partners after a lapse of several years.  Of course, the odds against a note going back to the persons who wrote something on it are astronomical, but in Hollywood improbability of plot is part of the game, as long as everything is wrapped up neatly in the end. Good faces to look at, good sound, no violence, no foul language, no sex (practically), and you have almost all the ingredients of a nice romantic comedy. These days, that's probably the only thing that's left. All the other genres a glutted with obligatory gore and nudity--and the the f... word. Not much choice.  Advice: go back and re-watch the classics.ft. All the other genres a glutted with obligatory gore and nudity--and the the f... word. Not much choice.  Advice: go back and re-watch the classics.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I think I have figured out what is going on in this movie, probably because I got lucky.  On my first viewing I had no <BR>clue what the hell was going on. The movie haunted me for days. I decided for my second viewing I would start watching the movie upon the opening of the mysterious blue box.  The following scene is Betty sleeping in bed. The cowboy comes in and says, time to wake up pretty girl, giving away the clue that the first part of the movie is all a dream. Other clues are the two girls at club silencio, where the theme at the club is what you see is not what you get. Everything that transpires there is a test of our perception. Much like what we are watching is too a test of our preception, an illusion. Another clue is at Betty's first acting audition.  Before she starts her lines the director says, don't make it real until it's real.  This movie clearly becomes real once the box is opened. Don't try to look too deep into this movie because you will end up with a brain aneurysm.  Whether I am right or not this is truly a hypnotic movie watching experience with some classic scenes. Even at 2.5hrs in running time, you can never get enough Lynch.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Loved the movie, but the features (or lack thereof) are the worst that I've seen for any DVD to date.  Rent the VHS copy so that you have the ability to skip around, and save the remaining [amount] for something more practical--like an updated (Criterion Collection) release of this DVD.
B000062X9B|3.0|This is a very strong disk with a few soft spots, both thematically and aesthetically.  9 of the 14 tunes are very strong with some almost unbelievably good songs: Solitary Man, Mary of the Wild Moor, Wayfaring Stranger--JC now owns these.  Nothing more can be said about this giant's genius.  The cinematic Mercy Seat is almost unbearably intense.  Gorgeous.  The duet w/ Merle Haggard, I'm Leaving Now just couldn't be better.   But why bother covering that blowhard Bono?  Has anyone not heard One before?  Johnny sounds as disinterested in singing it as I am in listening to it.  Also, some of the corny stuff sounds like pandering or goofing off.<BR>It seems that the space on a Johnny Cash album is so valuable that song choice is a huge decision.  Rick Rubin continues to be one of the most interesting and important figures in American music with this series of disks.  If anyone out there knows Rick or Johnny, try to get Johnny  to sing Burning House of Love by X on the nex one.

B00004YKUY|1.0|This CD was a attempt on a band that has seen its heyday to make a few bucks off of its legacy. Steve Perry may not be with the band in person, but the sound didn't change. All they did was get a sound alike/look alike to replace him. The songwriting is average at best, the music is second rate. Go buy Jouney's Greatest Hits to hear how great this band can sound, but don't waste your money on this album.
B000002J1F|5.0|After the success of their eponymous first venture into Prog, Yes went all the way with this stunning disc. What strikes me most is the MUSICIANSHIP displayed here. These are WORLD-CLASS artists working on this one. Especially striking is William Bruford's astonishing battery of effects he can get out of his drum set. For instance, the one of the sounds at the beginning of &quot;Fish&quot; was made ny an empty plastic milk jug suspended from a frame! Bruford has got to be the best percussionist EVER.<br />Another feature unique to this album is the occurence of solo tracks, possibly inserted after the band saw the success of Howe's solo on the prevoius album. Jon Anderson's solo is my favorite of the five. Every time I listen to it I hear another vocal part! (for all you &quot;totally weird sounds&quot; enthusiasts out there, play this one backwards. PIPEDREAM!)<BR>My favorite moment is the piano solo on &quot;SSOTS&quot;, which gives Wakeman a chance to shine. Beautiful.<BR>I imagine most people reding this already have a copy of this album, so my reccomendation would be this: buy another copy and give it to a friend.
B00002E233|3.0|Deep Blue Sea is one of those dumb but fun action thrillers with enough humour and excting action set-pieces to cover it's flaws. Renny Harlin (Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, the Long Kiss Goodnight) adds plenty of intense, fast-paced action to satisfy audiences.<br />Still, it's no Jaws, and by the first half hour, plausibility and subtlety go out the window in favour of one big over-the top action scene after another. And one by one, the hapless people stuck in a gradually sinking laboratory get picked off in increasingly gory ways. It's entertaining to see them get munched, but unlike Jaws, you don't care about the characters, and subsequently want to see them become fish food.<br />But it is fun, and in turns, unpredictable and exciting. Forget about the script and hackneyed plot and enjoy.
0070511136|1.0|This book and its concepts are old and stoggy. Even worse is the seminar!
630512762X|5.0|John Woo, uber director of The Killer (1989), Hard Boiled (1992) and Broken Arrow (1996) proves that even after the move to Hollywood, he still knows how to create fantastic action and  Face Off is no exception. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Castor Troy, a villain, and John Travolta as agent Sean Archer, the only man who can stop Castor from unleashing a nuclear device.<br />Woo's trademarks are all present here: slow-mo gunfights, explosive action and those perennial doves. And both Nic Cage and Travolta are brilliant, especially Cage, whose eccentric performance is one of his most unrestrained and outstanding.  One of the best (if not THE best) action films ever made. Excellent.
B00005JKBC|1.0|This is a pretty good movie but I'm placing this review to warn buyers that many reports are now coming in with problems playing this disc. On many players, Toshiba particularly, the close captioning for hearing impeared appears after running a few minutes and can't be switched off. These are much worse than subtitles as they cover a large part of the screen at times and makes watching the movie very frustrating. Wait until the studio produces a repaired copy or you will risk having a title you can't watch and wait months to get a replacment.
B00000ILDE|5.0|James Cameron's gung-ho sequel is generally regarded as being superior to Ridley Scott's original. In my opinion, Scott's \\"behind you\\" approach to Alien works better than James Cameron's modus operandi: \\"blast everything into outer space\\".<br />Regardless, it's a great thrill ride, adorned with menacing Aliens (hats off to Stan Winston, the special effects are brilliant) and an equally menacing Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver got an Oscar nomination for the role). The DVD adds more footage including Ripley's discovery that all her family have died since the last film, and although the added scenes tend to slow the pace sometimes, they add to the character, and make the film feel more complete. Great visuals, ear-splitting sound and Cameron's trademark over-the top action make this a must buy.
B00005NGAG|5.0|When I watched this movie I fell in love with it. Rachel Weisz is suberp as Petula and Susan Lynch is great as Dorothy. It all begins when Petula and her boyfriend Brian are fighting, and Brian starts strangling Petula, and Dorothy comes to her rescue and kills Brian by hitting him in the head with a lead pipe.<br />The action continues from there, its almost Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels meet Thelma and Lousie. Awesome flick!!!!!
B00005UW7V|5.0|First of, David (the kid from 6th sense) acting was superb.  I could have sworn he was a real robot in the beginning.  The story is unmatched but very gloomy.  I guess thats why the whole setting is fixated in the future where everything is simplified and possible.  However, love is still untainable even if artifically created.  The conflict begins when the catalyst is introduce - which is jealousy.  I will not destroy the story as everyone wrote practically the whole story.  In essence, as vague as this rating is, is that love is a force which not even humans can control.  Robots are programmed and so can we.  The possibities of creating an artificial intelligence is endless.  This story provokes fear and thought.  The concept of an inanimated object to love so unconditionally is so heartbreaking.  After I saw this movie - all I can think of is how cruel we can be.  I guess acceptance is something we must rely on to control the fear of love.  Watch this movie with a box of tissues because you will drown as it progress.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|What more can be said about The Beatles and all the band's top hits? This CD offers one feel-good hit after another, 27 times. It's pretty astounding, really. There's a boyish charm to most of these tunes, especially the early recordings. George Martin, the band's producer, said it best in his message within the CD booklet: \\"Never did they (The Beatles) fall back on a cliche or a rehash of an earlier success.\\" It's so very true.<br /><br />Though all these songs are great, the highlights for me on \\"1\\" include \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand,\\" \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" \\"Ticket To Ride,\\" \\"Day Tripper,\\" \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Something\\" and \\"Let It Be.\\" The Beatles had such great musical chemistry, which made the group highly infectious. To me, this band is probably the most cohesive, melodic bunch of guys to ever play rock 'n' roll music. It's just great pop music, with simple but worthy themes (mostly about love), great vocals and astounding melody. Plus, songs like \\"Yesterday,\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" give \\"1\\" a sense of elegance. I guess Beatles' material \\"matured\\" as time went on, but there's nothing wrong with charming pop hits, either. No. 1 hits on the charts can sometimes be total trash (especially these days), but these songs are revolutionary.
B00004RF8J|5.0|One Day in the Month of September, a mean green mother from outer space came.  She came to eat and eat and eat...and eat some more.  But, it was Seymour Krelborn, a shop clerk who stopped the man-eating plant and saved our world from the menace of outer space.<br /> One of my favorite movies!
B00005MP58|5.0|I first got to watch this adaptation of Austen's Pride and Prejudice when my parents bought the original DVD release.  I was immediately charmed by the series, and couldn't stop watching it.<br />Despite the series' excellence, its original DVD release was not without its shortcomings.  The compression was one of the lousiest I've ever seen (we have a dvd player with a VERY small buffer, which will not play high-bitrate DVDs; this DVD played on it with no problem, the bitrate was so low!).  There was a noticable lack of extras, and the menu itself was spartan, to say the least.<br />The Special Edition remedies just about all of these problems.  Not only has the picture been remastered, but it is also presented in ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN (Now there's something I didn't expect) The sound has also been remastered, and sounds beautiful, crisp and full.  For extras, you get &quot;The Making of Pride and Prejudice&quot;, which is a decent little documentary.  I would have preferred a few less scenes taken straight from the final print of the movie, and more off-takes and off-screen happenings.  But it works.  The only other extra you get is the biographies/bibliographies/filmographies, which are not very comprehensive.  The menu is still somewhat minimal.<br />Even if you don't like period dramas, I can't reccomend this series enough.  If you already own the previous DVD set or even the VHS set, you won't regret having bought this Special Edition.  A great presentation of a great film.
6301697707|5.0|Tremors takes place in a small village called Perfection in the Nevda desert.  A nice village, with only a handful of people who live there.  There's only one store, and the town has a unique problem.  A underground creature problem.<br />  A creature dubbed &quot;Graboids&quot; lives underground and hunt by movements above ground.  Graboids are 30 foot long creatures that like to munch on anything and anybody.<br />  Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are the &quot;handy men&quot; of Perfection, taking care of all the dirty work.  They both start to move to the next town, but the road is blocked.<br />  The town is anything but Perfection when the graboids start to munch on the townspeople.  Only a handful of people live through the movie, like all horror movies.
6305014140|5.0|This was the first Anime that I had ever seen in my life way back in 97 (what a debut, right?).  For a while, it took me a long time to find on that could match it's complete package of great heros, villains, story plot, and animation quality.  Since then, the mind has matured in the way of anime, and this one is still near the top.  This is one of those movies where if someone has the gall to say that they didn't like it, you'd look at that person funny from that point out.  <br />Look at my title....
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I purchased this DVD this past Tuesday since I heard it was a great film from my friends and cousins. Coming into this movie with the plot outline I read a few weeks back really led me to a totally different place, but after seeing the movie I am thankful it went the way it did instead. It is truly amazing. This is an excellent movie which sort of defies classification: thriller, mystery, sci-fi, horror - it just doesn't seem to fit altogether in one category in particular. I have not felt so in awe after a movie since Fight Club. It is just so beautiful. The camera shots, the scenery, everything is so beautiful. The mood is set so well. There is a certain &quot;ambience&quot; which the director/writer Richard Kelly (27 - 28 years old) is able to create which alternately gets you laughing, thinking, or just sends chills up and down your spine. The plot is mind blowing, really really mind blowing. So much information to process, so many mysteries, so many thoughts it is hard to say anything but &quot;Wow&quot;. I am lost in my chills and my hollow stomach, and I feel thoroughly satisfied. You can not watch this movie just once, it just won't let you. The experience watching this movie is one of the most gratifying experiences I have ever felt. I love this movie. And even if you didn't get the ending, you can't but help enjoy the creepy atmosphere which runs through this film. There is nothing quite like it and probably won't be for a long time.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This album totally brings back the feeling of 80's new wave and thrash.  This is comparable to Devin Townsend's work as in merging past genre's of the 80's with metal and industrial music.  Andrew WK could possibly get other underground bands such as Devin Townsend into the spot light in MTV and if not that at least get him on Ozzfest.
B000002MY3|2.0|What's most disappointing about this album is how musically uninteresting it is.  The countless music videos she made (all clever in their own right) alluded to a deeper artistry, but without the accompaniment of a clever visual, it becomes increasingly apparent that the songs have about as much musical depth as anything on TRL. The songs themselves--\\"One Hand In My Pocket\\" is a great song to listen to on the radio. And \\"You Oughta Know\\" as well; it hits your ear within seconds. But that's the point. You listen to it, you like it immediately, you listen to it again, and you like it less, and less, and less, until you find yourself dreading the moments when MTV would play it...again. Jagged Little Pill is filled with old pop songs of the worst and most irritating variety, fraught with production overkill and video overplaying.<br />The lyrics do not appear to have a structure, like stanzas or repetition. For example, on \\"All I Really Want,\\" Alanis tries to fit a monologue into a short measure. The words are so sticky and unflowing, that the way she stays on the same notes to keep in rhythm is simply ackward. That would be okay if she actually had something interesting to say.  \\"Boyfriends are mean.  I love you because you made me feel like a princess.  My parents put too much pressure on me.\\"  Are these topics we need to hear about?  Actually maybe.  But the way Morrissette discusses them is so unimaginative.<br />Screechy and distinctive as it is, Morrissette's voice is devoid of a certain personality that really sticks out in one's mind. There should be a charisma, a humanism, or a certain thrill in sharing secrets in self-confessional singing like a passionate, unpretentious singer like Fiona Apple. But Morrisette struck me as cold most of the time, always pitting the blame for her troubles on someone else, usually a boyfriend or even her parents (\\"Perfect).  She never admits that she might have some doubts about herself, and it's frustrating to listen to someonewho essentially thinks the whole world is to blame for her problems. <br />If Alanis were a man, her badly conceived lyrics, lack of charisma, and hooky but mundane melodies would be laughable.  <br />Alanis also downplays her sexuality, always unsexy, nearly asexual, with the exception of the \\"the theater\\" line in \\"You Oughta Know\\", there is never a hint of sexual longing or sexual<BR>expressiveness.  She attempts this in \\"Head Over Feet\\" but the  lyric is talking entirely about what He did to make her love him, once again sustaining that mechanical distance.<br />Despite this, in the mid-90's Alanis was annointed the epitome of the unconventional, Independent Woman. An independent woman would write all of her songs, instead of depending on a man to co-write the music.  An indepedent woman would convey herself as a flawed but strong human, not a finger-pointing feminist messiah. Mostly, an independent woman would depend on her artistry and not her status as an Independent Woman.
B00005JKES|4.0|I never watched this series when it was on t.v. because I don't watch t.v. I thought \\"The Prisoner\\" was the only good t.v. series, but that was in the '60s! It was only after I watched several of David Lynch's movies (I was particularly impressed with \\"Blue Velvet\\") that I decided to watch \\"Fire Walk With Me\\". I loved it so much, I borrowed a bunch of \\"Twin Peaks\\" episodes on video from my sister in law! It was like I needed my fix every night! She had the pilot (not on this dvd) and all the episodes on this dvd (1-7), but not the last episodes showing \\"who killed Laura Palmer\\". I have never seen those episodes! It doesn't matter that I know who killed Laura! I was hoping this had all those episodes, and it didn't. I will go insane if they aren't released on dvd soon!<br />I was very pleased to revisit this wierd town again, but I think they could have given us more extras. The packaging is great. I just wish more extras were in it. The pilot should have been included as well. It's weird to hear \\"previously on Twin Peaks\\" as soon as you hit play!
B00000099Y|5.0|Well, I listened to Aenima once at HMV, and I bought it immediately. So, I took it home, and listened to the whole thing. The songs that really stand out, in my opinion, would be Stinkfist, Eulogy, H, 46 and 2, Jimmy, Aenema and Third Eye. Notice that, other than 2 songs and the segues, I loved ALL of the songs! Now, isn't that amazing. O yeah, and you ... who think Tool should get rid of the \\"filler\\" like Die Eier Von Satan and (-) Ions, you really are dumb. Useful Idiot is an intro to 46 and 2. Intermission is an intro to Jimmy. Die Eier Von Satan makes you think Hitler is alive again, but all it is is a recipe for cookies! great stuff. Message to Harry Manback is downright creepy: a ton of threats for some guy, and in the background, love music is played on a piano. (-) Ions just adds to the mood - a raging storm with the power lines outside cut. I really don't know what Cesaro Summability does for the album, but all the other 1 or 2 minute tracks have a purpose. Without them, this album wouldn't be nearly as disturbing. P.S. Don't you DARE skip the 14 minute long Third Eye: I made that mistake, and then came back to it, and I LOVED IT! it's my favorite song now. Anyways, buy Aenima if you haven't already, and it'll be the best 14 bucks you'll ever spend (Well, you could make a case for Lateralus, I guess).
B00005T30L|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" was the best movie I've seen in a LONG damn time.  The key to a great movie is that it's its own world --<BR>a self-contained universe.  \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" is one such example, so is \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"For a Few Dollars More.\\"  Any of Billy Wilder's movies, too.  This one was one of them.  <br />I love Enid.  A teenage H.L. Mencken, she skewers pretentious poseurs and tips over sacred cows.  But, underneath her outer punk persona, there is a soft-hearted hero-worshipper.  Her predicament is that she's stranded on a social desert island and uses cynicism as a shield to protect her from the hopeless banality in which heroes and passion are deemed passe by people who walk through life questioning nothing, but just parroting the answers they've picked up from the larger society.  <br />\\"Ghost World\\" abounds in social commentary, but doesn't fall into the schmaltzy trap of trying to \\"solve\\" the world's social ills.  Although on the surface Enid is directionless, she nonetheless has a mania for sketching a diary of the oddballs and weirdos that make up her small town.  An excellent artist and charicaturist, Enid ends up failing art class TWICE.  <br />Her airheaded hippy/burnout art teacher, Roberta (Illeana Douglas), is a walking cliche of a total conformist affecting an air of anti-authoritarianism.  She blows off Enid's diary and her cartoons of Don Knotts, but pushes her students to instead produce so-called \\"controversial\\" art.  A really dead-on scene is when one of Roberta's sycophantic students creates a sculpture out of coathangers, which represents \\"a woman's right to choose, something I feel super-strongly about.\\"  It's a gem of a parody on political art in which the politics are much stronger than the art.  I was rolling on the floor when Roberta's real bad college art film \\"Mirror/Father/Mirror\\" clip was playing. God damn, that rings true.  Roberta doesn't encourage the artistic impulse so much as pushing her agenda on the students to be \\"controversial\\" and \\"confront people's attitudes.\\"<br />So, Enid decides to spoof Roberta and bring in a \\"found object\\" of a Jim Crow charicature from the 1920s of \\"Coon's Chicken,\\" which depicts a monkey-like negro.  This pisses off the other students (who were sotto voce receiving the message that they should only confront people with PC controversy), but the irony of the movie is in how Roberta reacts to the Jim Crow poster; Enid can't get the time of day from her when it comes to her own talented artwork, but her jokes on Roberta's inanities wins Roberta over to her cause and even inspires Roberta to get Enid a scholarship to art college.  All this falls apart when Roberta enters the piece in an exhibit, and the local censors force her to remove the poster and fail Enid in her class.  Her capitulation reveals her devotion to \\"controversy\\" and \\"confrontation\\" to be a hollow pose, and she covers her [rear] by letting Enid be the lamb to the slaughter.<br />The relationship between Enid and Seymour (Steve Buscemi) evinces Enid's yearnings to find someone to look up to, rather than down upon.  I liked Steve Buscemi a lot.  I'm so used to him playing funny roles, that it was sort of incongruous seeing him play it (mostly) straight in a comedic movie, but it worked quite well. Like Enid, Seymour is a middle-aged outcast, and at first becomes the victim to one of Enid's and her best friend Rebecca's (Scarlett Johansson) cruel pranks.  But underneath the nerdish and pitiful exterior, Enid comes to discover in Seymour someone as isolated and alientated from society as she is.  She finds in him a noble soul, whose passions are worn less on his sleeve than Enid's are, but locked up in his 1920s-themed room dedicated to his 78 rpm blues and ragtime records and poster art from the same era.  Enid sees in Seymour a lot of herself, but also someone who has been run over once too many times in life and whose social rebellions have shrivelled into repressed loneliness.  Enid finds in Seymour a hero, and gushes \\"I'd kill for a room like this\\" when complimenting his passion for nostalgia.  To which Seymour -- who has given up on the possibility of ever fitting in or finding love -- replies \\"go ahead, kill me.\\"<br />By the movie's end, Seymour starts asserting his inwardly pent-up feelings to relate to the world through his romance with Enid.  Finally getting up the nerve to break up with Dana, a nice, though conventionally-thinking person, in order to be with Enid, who shares his passions, and thinks like he does, Seymour nonetheless has his love for Enid somewhat unrequited. Just as the revelation that Seymour deserves happiness manifests itself, Enid alientates herself from the world -- and the two people she most treasured in the world, Seymour and Rebecca.  A happy ending does not win the day, because Enid is compelled to travel down the same lonely path that Seymour has.  Perhaps in twenty years, she will have become what he is now.<br />As I recall, this movie was nomimated for absolutely NOTHING by the Academy of Motion Pictures \\"Arts and Sciences.\\"  And yet, this was the best movie in a year barren of talent, originality and true cinematic art.  Now I understand why this movie is called \\"Ghost World.\\"
B00005RFAI|4.0|this albim really surprised me. I expected the useal stuff about her boyfriend dumping her or she was in love. but i took a gamble and bought it anyway.to my surprize she can really do it up. a mixture of blues and pop and alt. rock make this a breakout album for her.I like the fact that PINK trusts her voice to go through all the different ranges in these songs. It takes a real singer to do a album like this and if people are comparing her to britney spears she need not worry anymore. I dont think brit has the vocal range to cover an album like this, nor would she ever take the chance.  go PINK! highly reccommened.
B00003CXTG|1.0|They made the trailer look all sweet like it was going to a good war movie, I was expecting something along the lines of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" <--great movie by the way, but this was total [junk], it wasn't a war movie, it was a cheesy, mediocre love story with a little bit of action in between. Why do you think they rated it PG-13? I think it's so \\"everyone\\" could go see it, to make tons of money, and not offend anyone (except for those of us with taste)
B000002IXS|5.0|There is no doubt that Mireille Mathieu is one of the most versatile French performers ever. She's been seen as another Piaf for years, and that has affected her career sometimes positively and mostly negatively. <BR>In this album, Mathieu sings some of the most famous Piaf songs. Let's not forget that this is Mireille singing  . . . not Edith Piaf & the results are breathtaking. Yes, she does a [Heck] Of A Job!!!! Her own interpretations are spellbinding & Heavyweight. <BR>A few people performed Piaf's songs with such elegant and power.<BR>Strictly Recommended.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|...<br />I'll freely admit that I dont like all the album, Baby Driver doesnt do it for me, and there are a few other songs that while attractive don't quite shatter me either. However, Bridge is just one of those seminal tunes, a once in a lifetime piece that was not once in a lifetime for Paul (he managed to write at least 15 songs that if not its equal are darn close from as far back as Kathy's Song to as near to the present as The Obvious Child), and cannot be underestimated as an achievement. Amazingly beautiful, orchestrated perfectly, and despite Pauls misgivings, the second half of the song holds up beautifully. El Condor Pasa is a gorgeous reimaging of Latin Folk. Cecilia is so infectious even a three year old could tell its genius. The only living boy in New York is so achingly beautiful it makes In My Life seem almost pedestrian in comparison (and this from a die hard Beatles fan!).  Keep the Customer satisfied is fun, and possesses a deeply satisfying driving rythem w/terrific singing. The Boxer is a stand alone masterpiece that can equal anything from Dylan. I can go on and on. Its just plain Genius and it doesnt matter what generation your from.
0060977493|5.0|This book powerfully recalls the astonishing feat Faulkner performed in rendering children's points of view as they try to comprehend and assimilate the tragedies drawn and suffered by the significant adults in their lives. With an equally experimental and more poetical narration than Faulkner, Arundhati Roy renders a family saga comprehending three generations in Kerala. The book should be read aloud; it needs to be heard. The brooding sense of looming disaster made me put the book aside several times, for I could not bring myself to see the disaster which would fracture the worlds of the two-egg twins. But the charm of the twins and of the narration, the eccentricities of the characters, brought me back each time to the charms of the book. Like all great poetry this needs to be read aloud and read several times. It is like a traditional Romance--as opposed to the novel which aims to do realism--which is more dreamlike and poetic than an ordinary novel It should be categorized along side _Moby-Dick_ and _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ and _Sound and Fury_.
B00005RDAE|2.0|I expected this video to have her hit videos. But when I sat down to watch it, it began with \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" which is a great video so I was like 'hey this is cool'. Then it went into her \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\" VMA performance and then the video. And then it's just her dancing at photoshoots to her song \\"Anticipating\\". What's with that? And then there's \\"Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman\\"...no argument there. Then Behind Crossroads. Which is interesting...but not. And then her \\"Overprotected\\" performance. And that's it. Then it ends with some pictures with the credits. I guess I expected way too much from a Britney Spears video but I thought there'd be a LITTLE more to it.
B000002H72|5.0|Beautiful, that's the only way to describe this.<BR>Less upbeat than Surfer or Bossanova. Hey is amazing, but kim makes the record. The production is pretty, pastel shades rather than surfers' clear black and white, bossa's shimmering colours, and trompe's polarized gleaminess, but, unfortunately dave's drums sound false, he's one of the best drummers in the world, why make him sound like an EMU-drumulator? That's my only complaint.<br />Or for those who haven't heard the pixies, they're:<br />Far better than nirvana, or any imitators, the pixies trick was the 'soft start, loud chorus' stolen from 'petty theif lout' by the fall. the pixies are sort of like a slower, generally less [good] husker du. only better than the husker. <br />p.s. buy all pixies LP's and about 15-20 of the fall's ones.

B000001FFR|5.0|THRASH TIL DEATH! This album shows Anthrax circa 1985 when they were at their most rambunctious and rowdiest. This album along with S.O.D.'s Speak English or Die kick started punk-thrash metal and revolutionized the scene. (That is until 1986's Reign in Blood revolutionized the scene forever). This song is all thrash, no maturity, no pointless ballads, no heartfelt emotions, no sorrow any of that pointless [junk]. This is just a bunch of kids that wanted to get together and have some good thrashing fun. Best song are \\"A.I.R\\", \\"Madhouse\\", and \\"Medusa\\".
B00005NB8J|5.0|Stargate takes us on a fantastic journey to a &quot;what if&quot; story about ancient Egypt and the questions we have no answers for. At one level in the movie, a Special Forces team led by Kurt Russell ventures to the other side of the known universe in search of the truth, and at another you come face to face with the idea that there was not a single Egyptian culture, but perhaps more and certainly some that are far more ancient than what we currently know and believe.<br />The movie has everything from bad aliens with nasty weapons to a love story (that avoids the normal Hollywood approach) to scientific fact and speculation.
B000002H33|5.0|After this album it all went downhill for Metallica. Well, Justice for All was good but this album is definitely their peak. This album was just all pure raging thrash fury with epic thrash metal classics such as &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Welcome Home: Sanitarium&quot;, and &quot;Damage Inc&quot;. Everyone thought that this was the definite thrash metal album that everyone would be talking about forever. It is a good album but later that year REIGN IN BLOOD came out and absolutely slaughtered this album. Anyways buy it if you like thrash metal.

Im a guy who usually doesnt read that many books, but a few guys at school said it was good. SO i bought it and read it. This book about two teenagers falling in love has brought me into a new world. I never cry in movies, books or songs. BUt this time i had to put the book down for a tissue. This book touches your heart like nothing else. This was so good i recommended it to every one in my family. You should, no you must read this book.
B00005AQGH|5.0|this is pacs realest truest album.  when you listen to it you can tell he put everything into this album.  it was like a combination of me against the world and all eyez on me.  he had those hardcore songs like bomb first and against all odds and he had those deep songs like krazy and white manz world.  the only song i dont like is hold ya head.  my favorite song on there is hail mary.  the outlawz did real good on life of an outlaw.  to live and die in l.a. was a good follow up to california love.  i really liked krazy and white manz world.  we saw a return from the deep artist we heard in me against the world.  you feel 2pac on every song.  if this had been a double disc this would have made all eyez to shame.  if you love 2pac because you feel him and you know what hes talking about in his music you need to get this.  no rapper will ever come out with an album like this.<BR>                      by 2pacs #1 fan
0553275569|4.0|This non-fiction tells more than the story of America's race for space - but actually tells a deeper story: of America's push into the next frontier and how it discarded the heroes and heroism that led the way.  Beginning with the early years of the jet age - when jets were prone to disintegrate at transonic speeds if they didn't just fail, Wolfe charts the conquest of the sonic barrier by Chuck Yeager.  When the Russians jump the gun and pioneer the artificial satellite (and the nuclear-capable ICBM that lofted it into orbit) the US responds with its own programs - which fail miserably.  The triumph of Gagarin's and Leonov's space flights spur the Americans to use unproven and flimsy hardware, and respond with apparently less success.  (Unlike the first Soviet space flights which achieved orbit, the first American astronauts flew short suborbital missions; though superior technology allowed the west to loft satellites comparable to Sputnik but much smaller, conventional wisdom held the grapefruit-sized satellites as inferior).  Though military test pilots had been flying (and dying) in virtual anonymity for years, those chosen to fly the American rockets become national heroes before the first launch.  Wolfe parallels the civilian Mercury program that lofted the first Astronauts with the exotic but military X-15 program (which did not reach as high or as fast, but was at least flown by a pilot like an airplane) as if paralleling a more promising program with one that people were more interested in.  The distinction is between the heroism that the Mercury astronauts stood for, and the heroism X-15 pilots (who snapped up no book deals) actually embodied.<br />\\"The Right Stuff\\" is a triumph.  Though it doesn't tell the whole story of the space program, Wolfe sets up an ingenious theme.  The pilots and astronauts of the day were heroes, like knights of the round table, and the cold war was there crusade.  While this sense of the epic was an outgrowth of the end of WWII, the burgeoning missile and nuclear technologies meant it would soon become impossible to see the world in simplistic terms.  Though technology improved, those who developed or relied on it matured as well, shedding their addiction to the epic - John Glenn (whom Wolfe paints as a sincere hero) clashes with NASA bigwigs and never flies again (until the late 1990's), while Chuck Yeager assumes command of test pilot school, only to confront Kennedy-era political correctness.  The book ends on a bittersweet note - with Mercury giving way to Gemini, and the end of the X-15.  Wolfe describes these events and others as hallmarks of the cold-war's end.  No longer would American's fly in space solo like warriors of old, while the demise of the X-15 eliminated American warriors from spaceflight entirely.  Paralleling this were the Cuban missile crisis and the DC-Kremlin hotline.  There would still be a cold war but, divorced from its epic delusions, we would learn how to end it...eventually.  So profound was this change in mentality that, JFK's assassination at the crosshairs of a pro-Castro militant did not raise red-scare hsyteria.<br />\\"The Right Stuff\\" also triumphs because of its unique perspective of the time which seems to parrot the hysteria of the day without actually condescending to it. Through the book we see the world marvel at the illusion of Russian ingenuity (\\"imagine, they kept a man alive up there a whole day!\\") while remaining fatalistic about American blunders (\\"our boys always screw up!\\"  \\"Our rockets always explode!!\\")  Wolfe inspired a new school of journalism and history, but none have come close to matching this feat.

6300216268|5.0|What? You havent seen Harold and Maude? This is the movie that we identified with in the early 70s. Yes, it is outrageous and funny, but more than that it teaches a simple lesson: loving life. This is a one of a kind movie that others have tried to imitate but have never hit the mark like this one did. Ruth Gordon and But Cort are perfectly cast but special mention has to be made of Vivian Pickles, the woman playing Harold's mother. She was robbed of not being given the 1971 Oscar for best supporting actress. She wasnt even nominated! We loved this one in the 70s because it represented viewpoints that we were all striving to attain. For those of you who are younger, if you are a fan of Benny and Joon, see where they got the inspiration. This one is as quirky but loveable as it gets.
B00005MAM2|5.0|As far as i'm concerned this is the movie that blew the lid off of anime feature films in the U.S. So for newcomers, to story or genre, I recommend this title above all else. Based on the excellent manga by (director) Katsuhiro Otomo, it is an alternate version of the story told in those comics (which was actually better than this gem but would make for too long a film). Kaneda ( who is owner of the coolest fictional motercycle ever created; check the McFarlane Toys flyer that comes in the case for an idea) and Tetsuo, two teenage friends from the gritty streets of  Neo-Tokyo and members of a violent biker gang, are the main focus. Their story begins when, during a gang turf skirmish, they encounter a military unit on an abandoned freeway,and more importantly when they encounter the secrets the military is desperate to protect. Akira is definatly mature in nature and presentation,the story is more disturbing than most first time viewers think. It takes no prisoners and is extremely brutal and grizzly at times, but it is the pinnacle of this type of entertainment. For vets who've seen it on vhs a hundred times and haven't touched it in years I recommend you revisit this edition. The remaster is top-noch, english dialouge has been retranslated to better fit the original screenplay, and, to me, makes the script come across much better. The extra disc, not anything extrodinary, has a extensive pic-and-paragraph glossary plus the basic interviews and behind the scenes elements of which some, in this case,were interesting to me. I am definatly glad I own this one and most mature anime fans will be too.
6305428425|2.0|Many people are incredibly fond of this picture, and not just on Amazon. I don't get it. I can't even say that it's Sorvino or Kudrow's fault- they're both engaging, and there are other pictures they've been in which attest to their comic abilities, but they have an uphill struggle against this script.<BR>   Even with a mostly coherent story,**Romy and Michelle** feels like a series of tv show sketches strung together, because most of its humor depends on people being two-dimensional stereotypes and behaving according to the dictates of gag writers rather than being wholly realized(or even semi-realized) characters.<BR>   I wonder if many people like this movie because they WANT to like it so hard, much like the fable of the emperor without clothes, which makes one of the many implausible gags kind of appropriate, come to think of it.<br />I liked Parker Posey in  **Party Girl**, like, ten thousand times better.

B00005JKJA|5.0|I've got one word for:&quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; and it is:WOW! That was a really good movie. But it's not perfect. David Lynch directed and wrote this movie really well. He also did the music pretty good. The acting was good. Those two lead actress (who I've never seen before) both are good and could a good carrer if they are in the right movies and get good breaks. Most of the cast was good. Dan Hedya was not in the film enough tho. Billy Ray Crus did a good job in his two scenes. There were some people in the movie that were not that good. The stroy line &amp; plot are good and really original. The beging of the film was kind of slow but then it picked uped and was good. But the last 25 mintues are defintly the highlight of the movie. Most of the 147 mintues good buy good expect for those slow parts. I expected a better DVD for this movie tho. Becuase it did well for indie film. The features are:Theatrical Trailer (1:47) which is good and there is also Cast/Film Maker Bigoraphys. There are bio's and film highlights for four of the cast member and they are 3 pages and there is the dricetor which is two pages. This is a really good movie and I hope that there is a special edition DVD planed for it!<BR>9/10

B00003CY6M|2.0|\\"Serendipity\\" could have been a good movie. Insted it was a big let down. I thought that movie was well stupid. The stroy line and plot are okay. With the cast the movie had it sould have been really goo (I'm not saying the acting wasn't good - it was).<BR>It's just the script is just so badily written that makes the movie unenjoayble. They wrote a pretty much unfunny movie, only laughed a few times. The end was perdicatble. I knew had it was going to end for the tv spot. Well that was a disapointment. The DVD has extras but they are not good. Commentray is boring. <BR>\\"Starz on the Set of Serendipity\\" wasn't okay it lasted to long (almost 20:00). The Deleted Scenes (nine) [stank]. I can see why they were cut. And most of them were alternate or extened. Only two were deleted this last almost 16:00. Stroybody-To-Fianl Scene-Comparesion was pretty good and it's last not even a minute. The trailer was okay it last two & 1/2 mintues. The soundtrack spot wasn't good. The \\"Bounce\\" & \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" sneek-peeks were good and came out to almost 4 mintues. There was also a dumb sneek peek \\"About Adam\\" lasted almost 2 mintues. Plus a Director's Diary(in text) it was boring. So this movie & DVD are a let down. I recomend only when every thing elese that you wan't to see is out!<BR>4/10<BR>-RuffRyders20013
B00000J7S8|3.0|... I've given it many listens over several months, and I still don't get it. The problem is that it just doesn't sound very interesting! <br />To my ear it's performed and sung perfectly well but if you want to be moved there are many greater performances out there, be it in jazz, opera, classical, folk, or whatever. If you are considering buying this CD, you may love it like many others here, or you may find it rather dull.
078322804X|5.0|When I first saw The Blues Brothers, I expected to see a typical comedy with nothing else to offer. I was very wrong. You are taken along for a wild ride with Jake Blues (John Belushi) and Elwood Blues (Dan Akroyd). The two brothers have to reassemble theri band within a week, get enough \\"gigs\\" to earn $5000 to help the orphanage where they were raised stay in operation. All the while they make enemies from Nazis, rednecks, and of course the police.<br />Like the shark in Jaws, the music in The Blues Brothers steals the show as the star. Like \\"China Town\\", which had a cast all at their prime, The Blues Brothers have many great comedians and musicains in their prime. John Belushi, Dan Akroyd, John Candy, Cab Calloway, Carrie Fischer in great comedic roles. The Blues Brothers Band (which is a real band), Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Jams Brown, and many others in great musical roles. <br />Special Features are great, including trailors and a feature about the making of the film that also has a chapter selection.<br />Bottom Line:<BR>The Blues Brothers is a gem, both comedically and musically. It's a cult classic like \\"Animal House\\" and gives us a chance to see departed talents John Belushi, Cab Calloway, and John Candy. If you want a film to fall in love with and a great DVD, Blues Brothers needs to be on your shopping list. This is a very lovealbe film that I would recommend to everyone.
B00000J7JO|2.0|This is a terrible album.  It is quite boring and don't compare to Blood Sugar Sex Magik.  They went from being totally original on BSSM and One Hot Minute to being completely generic on Californication.  If you want real RHCP, listen to their old stuff.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Gladiator took home the Oscar for the Best Motion Picture of 2001 and rightfully so. Gladiator is a great movie with a great plot. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is taken from a high place of being a general with the Roman Army to a lowly slave and gladiator. Without giving away any more of the plot, I will just say that Maximus engages in several fights for his life and for Rome. <br />Every member of the cast in this film of epic porportions deliever the best performances of their career. No element of this film is done unintelligently, which actually would have been very easy to do in a film about a time where men wore women's style garments. The only thing that may be over rated is the special effects, some of which are clearly CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).<br />The Special Features Disc includes features that go above and beyond the normal call of duty. It flaunts some things we have never seen on any DVD yet. Dairies, trailors, televison spots, and many featurettes. <br />Bottom Line:<BR>You will love Gladiator. If you like action movies you get plenty of fights. If you like romance you will find that in Gladiator as well. Some war as well, inklings of comedy, and drama make it a blend of everything we go to the movies for. This is why Gladiator is the best picture of 2001 and possibly one of the top ten best American films ever. Anyone who wants a great film and a great DVD should purchase Gladiator right away without one thought of hesitation, rather you have seen it or not.
B000063CMK|5.0|The Swedish ProgMetal giants &quot;Pain Of Salvation&quot; have issued four great albums so far. But their most recent one, &quot;Remedy Lane&quot;, is clearly their most mature. Again, almost all tracks have been written by singer and guitarist Daniel Gildenlw. Again, the unique properties of the music are superb melodies, stunning vocal arrangements, and the perpetual change between immense instrumental power and breathtaking balladesque interludes. However, &quot;Remedy Lane&quot; is the first one that moves the band far beyound the confines of ProgMetal. While Pain Of Salvation still have retained the power of their previous works, their musical dynamics and instrumental variety have increased quite a bit. Although the music still gives me a strong feeling of ProgMetal, it's sometimes hard to spot the origin of this feeling, because there are long musical passages where the instrumentation is somewhat untypical - let's say, &quot;unmetallic&quot;. Some tracks make heavy use of piano, synths, and acoustic guitar, yet you can't really classify them as &quot;ordinary&quot; ProgRock. It's something beyond metal and rock - it's an offering!
B00005JKQX|5.0|He changed the way that the world is run. He forever shaped the way we look at the world. His story is unbelievable, but is true. He is John Forbes Nash, a paranoid schizophrenic who's acomplishments shaped computer processing and the game theory.<br />A Beautiful Mind, winner of several Academy Awards including Best Picture & Best Director (Ron Howard), is one of the most amazing stories of all time. It is amazing how Nash (Russel Crowe) was able to survive the torment of schizophrenic personallity disorder. It also stars Ed Harris, a angry control freak who works for a secret group in the government who inlists John's help to save America, and Jennifer Connely (Winner of Best Actress for her performance) who plays the woman that loved John and stuck with him. Russel Crowe perfectly plays Nash as a neurotic oddball who is a genius. The real John Nash is one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and created several theorys that went into the game theory. It would take to long to explain the game theory, but luckily the film explains part of it. If you want to know more, like I did, pick up The Essential John Nash book.<br />Some of the greatest things in this film are the makeup design and the score. The makeup design transforms Russel Crowe into John Nash from his college days to present time when he is a old man. The makeup on Jennifer Connely is also unbelievable. It transforms her into a old woman also. The score really brings the mood of the film to it. John's story is sad, but good at the same time. Which makes the score creation very hard, but they made it perfect. <br />I love this film and urge every human being on Earth to see it. John Nash's story of triumph of insanity is amazing and will change the way you look at the world. Then, get the soundtrack, the book, and The Essential John Nash book to get the full thing.
B000002KB8|5.0|Yes, Black Sabbath's self-titled album was the darkest and heaviest thing around when it came out, and it remains one of the darkest and best metal albums out there. It still amazes me how different this sounds than what was being produced at the time.<BR>1. Black Sabbath (10/10) The darkest, doomiest song on the album. I love the creepy intro, with the sound of rain in the background and doomy guitar. Type O Negative's cover of this isn't bad, but it can't beat the original.<BR>2. The Wizard (10/10) Surprisingly upbeat when compared to the first song, this is still a great jammin' song, with Ozzy even doing some harmonica, something you won't hear often in metal songs (probably a good thing).<BR>3. Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Basically/NIB (10/10)Great guitar work in this medley (actually 2 songs, Wasp and Basically are \\"intros\\"). Behind the Wall of Sleep seems to me to be about drugs - they would later have a song called \\"Snowblind\\" with lyrics that echo this song. NIB of course is the famous song of satanic enchantment, with the killer bass intro.<BR>4. Wicked World (10/10) This song has been overlooked I think - I've never heard a cover of it. It's a shame cos it's a really good song, killer drums and guitar at the beginning (and the entire song, but the intros always grab my attention). The lyrics also display social consciousness: \\"They can put a man on the moon quite easy / While people here on Earth are dying of old diseases.\\"<BR>5. A Bit of Finger / Sleeping Village / Warning (9/10) For some reason this track has never really kept my attention. It starts out slow, and later on some doomy guitar kicks in, then the tempo increases, but....It just doesn't seem to \\"flow\\" like the other songs do. Don't get me wrong, there's still some great guitar work on this track, sounding improvisational, but it just seems one step below the perfection of the other songs.<BR>There's a lot worth checking out on here, the dark, doomy, improvisational, even ephemeral, guitarwork, Ozzy's awesome vocals, Butler's crunching bass, the dark, apocalyptic, and socially conscious lyrics - if you like metal, you should have this.

B00002E224|4.0|Before Sunrise is one of those films that starts off slowly and never really picks up pace.  The journey is what this film is about.  Yeah it is kind of slow, but a good slow, that would lose it's appeal if it were any faster.<br />This film is quite typical of the romatic comedy genre, but it stands out due to it's strong lead performances and unique narrative stucture.  The plot is simple.  A boy (Ethan Hawke) meets a girl (Julie Delpy) on a train in Europe and they only have one day to spend together.  Do they fall in love?  Do they walk off into that sunset?  Well...see the movie.<br />Richard Linklater who made one of my all time cult favorites in Dazed and Confused has made a pleasant and engaging film.  The chemistry between Hawke and Delpy is apparent before they even speak to each other.  The script is filled with observations and insights that are not typically seen in this type of film.  Not a whole lot happens with the story, but a whole lot happens with the characters.  It is well done.
B00005JKJA|5.0|To describe this movie I might as well cite a widely known critic: &quot;You don't have to be smart to enjoy it, just willing to do a little work of your own and come to your own conclusions.&quot;<BR>Interestingly enough, this movie is already attracting at it's very surface, whereas it actually needs one or two cycles to just understand the basic plot. And only then the real pleasure begins, trying to put the numerous details into place.<BR>As the script itself is intellectually pleasing, I understand this movie to be an ensemble achievement. The cast is extraordinary and gives you an idea what acting is really about. Most notably, Naomi Watts is a blast. The camera is subtle, observe for example the 'continous movement' strategy, and the score, though mainly synth, congenial.<BR>I admit I always had a slight problem with Lynch since, to me, he sometimes seems to be a manipulator with the actual message missing. Now here, if you decide to understand the movie that way, you'll find at the bottom a deeply humanistic theme of Shakespearean dimension: &quot;a bit forced, maybe, but still humanistic.&quot; :)<BR>For me, in years maybe decades, beside Takeshi Kitano's Hanabi, one of the few real Masterpiece Candidates. A cinematic peak, presumably in the class of 81/2 and Andrei Rublev, as time will show.
B000002UB3|4.0|This  album recorded on 8 tracks in the late 60's early 1970 still sounds current. There is no need to explain the sound since it sounds(engineeringwise) exactly as clean and clear and polished as any Rock lp out today. The music  of course is way better! Moreover,this is the  beatles album where geoge  writes the two best songs &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; on the album out doing the Mcartney /Lennon  combine that held him down &quot;all those years ago&quot;.  Mind you, &quot;Come Together&quot; and &quot;Because&quot; are pretty good and so is&quot; O darling&quot;. &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; is great except that is a fragment as is &quot;You Never Give me your Money&quot;.

All in All it one of the Beatles  top 3 full lengths.(i am not a big &quot;Pepper&quot; lover tough its OK)
B00005JKBC|3.0|Robert Redford wasn't able to quite elevate The Last Castle from its limp, oversimplistic depths, but he certainly succeeds in Spy Game, a thriller constantly threatening to sink under its own weight but ultimately succeeding on old-fashioned star power.<br />The role of Nathan Muir allows Redford to resurrect the irreverent, witty persona that had launched him into superstardom in the first place, in classics such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Sting. The best scenes in Spy Games are hands-down the ones where Muir spars verbally with Tom Bishop (Brad Pitt), and the centerpiece -- a montage where Muir instructs Bishop on the tools of spying -- is terrific, also forming the theatrical trailer which had tempted me into watching this film in the first place.<br />It's too bad this movie moves forward in lurches and spurts. Bogged down by too much flashback, the central problem of rescuing Bishop becomes entirely moot. I can't say the flashbacks were all uninteresting; I just wish they had been more economical. Bishop's love interest (Catherine McCormack, stuck with a very vague role) enters the movie way past the halfway point, resulting in a seriously off-balance narrative. MTV-style overcutting also hurt. Veteran action director Tony Scott has generated much more excitement with much less empty flair in the past, in films like Top Gun, The Last Boy Scout and Enemy of the State. At times, the camera and editing trickery simply serve to drag down the performances, the multiple locations and schizophrenic music also coming together jarringly.<br />But thankfully, just when things get too grandiose for their own good, we come back to Redford's scenes. It's simply a lot of fun watching Muir manipulate everybody around him. The idea of a high-ranking CIA director messing with national security is a pretty disturbing one if you think about it, but after all, Spy Games is popcorn entertainment and shouldn't be taken too seriously.
B000002UAX|4.0|I was always a \\"Paul person\\". I  defended Paul when people started using the late John Lennon as a stick to beat Paul up with. Then again ,as a young man ,I could never afford The WHite Album. I never heard it until I borrowed the library's copy. NOW I see what people mean. John contributions(Dear Prudence,Happiness is a Warm Gun,Julia,I Cant Sleep) are mostly better than Paul's(OBLA _DI,Rocky raccoon) with Some exceptions(\\"still\\",Blackbird). On balance I would say Paul did  wrote more of the best stuff OVER THE WHOLE OF THE BAND'S RUN but on The White Album (as well as\\"Hard Days Night\\")John was puttin in the work.PS: Geoge scores with\\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" ,probably one of the thre best cuts on the set.
B000059R8Y|4.0|Eric Clapton's work is so consistently good that it's easy to overlook HOW good he is.  \\"Reptile\\" opens and closes with two instrumentals, kind of like bookends.  The opening track is a smooth jazz instrumental.  \\"Got You On My Mind\\" is a midtempo blues with a mean slide guitar and a roll with a Jimmy Reed influence.  \\"Traveling Light\\" has a throbbing guitar on another midtempo tune, \\"We can go to Paradise, maybe once, maybe twice.\\"  The positive lyrics with the light pop sound are great on the commercial \\"Believe In Life.\\"  \\"Come Back Baby\\" is a churning blues with Clapton's firebrand guitar followed by \\"Broken Down,\\" a slower blues.  A Scott Joplin-like piano roll highlights the loping melody of \\"Find Myself.\\"  My favorite track is the fiesty \\"I Ain't Gonna Stand for It,\\" a burning rocker with an infectious chorus....\\"I Want a Little Girl\\" is slow bluesy tune.  Clapton's vocals are resonant and assured as his guitar weeps on \\"Second Nature.\\"  Eric transforms James Taylor's \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\" into an aching blues lament.  \\"Modern Girl\\" is more smooth acoustic jazz, \\"Where would you fit in scheme of her day?  Where would you fit in her heart?\\"  \\"Superman Inside\\" is an electric rave-up.  The CD concludes with the reflective acoustic instrumental \\"Son & Sylvia.\\"  This is a VERY good set.  Clapton's blues and jazz inflections make \\"Reptile\\" one that gets better the more you hear it.  Enjoy!

B00005JKJA|1.0|This movie is quite simply the most horrible waste of time movie I've ever seen.<br />It is boring as hell and quite hard to understand.<br />-RoNNY
B00005JKED|5.0|this movie had my mind reeling for days after watching it. It leaves you with a complete sense of awe at the power and manipulation that goes on when someone wants to fit in so badly. the corruption comes though brillantly. great acting and direction.
B00000JCB2|1.0|i dont like this cd. this band just gets worse and worse. Wes, being the only talented member of this group, was smart for leaving. the hip-hop direction and Fred's ego dont work at all for this band. they should have stayed more rock like on 3DB. thats all im saying on this one. peace.
0440224764|5.0|I found his books on a holiday in America and have read through 3 in the last week and a half<br />If you have read many of Grisham's books then you will definatly like this one. Even if you have never read a book in your life then this is a good one to start on. Starting with the capture, torture and interrigation of Patrick it goes on to the crime he commited and to the huge amount of law suits filed against him. The ending was a twist which no one was expecting and was something of a bad ending. This doesn't take down any of my enjoyment of the book as it occured at the very end. The legal maniplution makes you laugh out loud especially the devorce case.
B000062YAZ|5.0|this CD is excellent! Fast, heavy, and energetic. For years and years they have been conquering the heavy metal world. They are a true metal band. Slayer is what thrash is all about. They deserve tons of credit and respect for not only playing their own style of music and being great at it for so long, but also for surviving and continuing to remain popular among the true metalheads. The songs on this album are some of their greatest. SLAYER!!!!!!!!!!
B00005U122|5.0|This is the one to buy!  Of course the music is good, this is Roger Waters we are talking about.  There was no question in my mind that he would make sure that the music would be dead on.  But the music being right is only the first in a long line of great things about this concert film.<br />The guitar work is of course different in places, but is just as good as the original Floyd work, and it offers a welcome look into what can happen with musical variations and different musicians.  Much more was live than I thought would have been.<br />The vocals are amazing as well.  Roger sure did his homework getting the vocals down, and during some of the songs, I was awe struck with the change into duet rather than keeping with the standard solo vocals.<br />The camera work was really at the top end of this sort of production.  Not once did I notice any clumsy camera work or camera men quickly ducking out of the shot.  Post production editing was also very good, as the film flowed seamlessly from one shot to the next.<br />Immediately thinking back to the concert, I would rather have this dvd than the cd, and the dvd is less expensive to boot!  <br />This is an incredible concert film and quite possibly one of the best dvd values out there.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is the best miniseries that's been ever made on tv! The cast is amazing, they give their best performance and the movie is very faithful to the book. Very faithful, I would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys watching period films or anyone that's into Jane Austen films.<br />This is a great movie, very little to object to i.e. some cleavage is shown, lydia and wickham live together a few days before they decided to get married. That's very minor and the positive outshadows the negative, so its appropriate for families. I would definately reccomend it.
0671027573|5.0|I really enjoyed the realistic heroine here. Jaine cracked me up with her penchant for cursing and I loved Sam, the hero/cop who lives next door.<br />Jaine has just bought her first home, and life is pretty good, except for her neighbor, a man who comes home bleary-eyed and rumpled. Jaine assumes he's a drunk and curses his loud, in need of a muffler car--which wakes her up at odd hours.<br />However, soon, the two neighbors see um, different sides of each other. Different...being nude. LOL When Jaine gets an eye-ful of her well endowed neighbor, suddenly, she sees him in a new, lusty light.<br />That's the romance side of it.<br />Now, as to the suspense...<br />Jaine and her three best friends who all work at this computer company get together each Friday at a grill/bar to have dinner, a drink or two and share about their life. One night, they decide to create a fictional list of qualities for the PERFECT Man. It should have been just a joke and laugh shared between friends, but it gets out to the local paper, and is picked up by national TV and Magazines. The women are thrust into the limelight. That limelight catches the eye of someone who considers himself the perfect Man, though he lacks all the qualities listed. And he will KILL to prove it.<br />Sexy, funny, sad and emotional, this was an extremely enjoyable read. I loved it.
B00004Y6NT|4.0|Looking at the cover of this album you recognize similes with the previous work; if you look at the track-list you'll find 9 tracks; and finally when you listen to the album you'll say \\"They are Dire Straits I heard on the 1st work\\". The malicious persons told that \\"Communiquè\\" is the exact copy of Dire Straits homomymous debut, but I say it's not a true copy, but another masterpiece like \\"Dire Straits\\" was (and it is!!). The album was recorded under the watchful eyes of old foxes like Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, and under the hottest sun of Bahamas' Islands, who characterized the singular radiance of the whole work. \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" reveals the Mark's inclination for the western atmospheres (who'll become clear with \\"Local Hero\\" soundtrack);\\"Portobello Belle\\" follows the city-tour started with  \\"Lions\\" and \\"Wild West End\\"; \\"Communiquèe\\" cites the young Mark's journalistic style (do you know that in the end of 60's wrote on the Yorkshire Evening Post?), and \\"News\\" (who'll be dedicated during the Making Movies tour, for the J. Lennon's Death!!)  one of the most intimist self-confessions of. M.K.. Communiquè shows in his limpidity a strange aspect of the society, nothing to do with the punk-movement; a well-educated group who gives prominence to his aspirations and interests, conscious not to be part of a privileged class. Knopfler's songwriting is more abstract than on the debut-lp, stories are less burning and just a little bit barely perceptible. Do you want to know why \\"Lady Writer\\" and \\"Where do you think you're going\\" where published on the same single\\" Discover why I consider this album the right step before \\"Making.......\\" it big.
B000060P79|5.0|I just bought this CD on Friday because I went to the Virgin Megastore and listened to the whole thing and I loved it. It's a really cool CD and I had never even heard of this band until I went there. The songs are good and fast. Some of them are slow but the words have a lot of meaning and its my favorite CD now. I think you should buy this CD and love this band. They rock.
0375703764|4.0|Much of what supposedly makes this novel experimental merely detracts from the reading experience.  The footnotes, in and of themselves, are not too bad.  But footnotes leading to footnotes, the upside down text, the text boxes within text, the one word per page pages, all get tedious and annoying after a while.<br />On the flip side, the story line involving the Navidson Record and the house is fascinating and kept me reading despite the B.S.  The sub-plot taking place in the footnotes, involving Johnny Truant, is less successful, as it constantly gets bogged down in self-pity, women, alcohol and drugs (don't let your sons grow up to be cowboys).  But still, there is some good stuff.  Johnny's past comes through subtlety and manages to build on the \\"is any of this real\\" theme flowing through the book.  Also, The Whalestoe Letters, found in the appendix, are fascinating and quite moving.<br />When all is said and done: Gravity's Rainbow it isn't (despite the glowing reviews on the cover).  But still, an interesting read.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This film is not for everyone.  But if you're into it, what a ride! I saw it in the theater and was mesmorized until it  insulted my intellience, and just when I thought Lynch was trying to pull off a gimmick, got me thinking, and then I kept telling myself now that Lynch has me thinking, if he doesn't pay off and pull the rug out from under me, I am going to very angry and never see a Lynch film again,(except Blue Velvet).  But he pulled off a remarkable, unique, beautiful, disgusting, sick,..., artful film that was worthy of a best director nomination.  And all of the clues are there in the context of the film to solve this a twisted plot.  Bravo Mr. Lynch!  The DVD version is outstanding but the theater experience can't be captured on disc.  The blurred frontal nudity is no big deal but I have to agree with others, we're adults and it should not have been altered. Like it or not the film is worth seeing!
0790729725|5.0|no need to explain the movie to yous, but it is without a doubt one of the best mob movies of all time. but the way the dvd is set up is enough to [tick] off the pope on easter sunday. you have to flip the thing a little over halfway into the movie. which doesn't make any sence. saving private ryan is all on one side, heat- one side, casino- one side, and all of those movies are longer than this one. i dont get it. plus the whole movie is on just one vhs tape. real wierd.
B00000IONU|3.0|This record is certainly cool, but if I'm looking for really raw, minimalist RnR with just 1 guitar &amp; drums, then  I'd rather take Bantam Rooster - they're wilder, faster, meaner and cooler, too. For a fuller Garage sound, then, I'd take Jeffrey Evans &amp; His 68 Comeback - they got more SOUL.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Very ambigious movie that will leave most viewers very uncertain. Lynch includes scenes and characters briefly to only add to the the confusion. I finished the movie asking too many questions as to who and what? To generalize in my opinion to what this movie is about is this:  A young insecure woman with an obvious identity crisis who cannot the handle the corruption and deceitfulness of the Hollywood scene.  Her dreams were crushed. To me, this movie did not make very much sense and I did not even have the desire to watch it a second time to gain clarity.  There are parts to this film I find very interesting, especially the bonding between the 2 female characters.  Some scenes are interesting  but I find that they never form a connection to the puzzle of what is going on and why.  I guess the concrete scenes the viewer sees are suppose to help him or her form their own symbolic or abstract message of what this movie is supposed to be all about.  This movie might click better with a crazy person who suffers from multi-personality disorders?
B000021YQV|4.0|Their first album was better. This a good CD, but it lacks the complete insanity of the first one (Sugar, Ddevil, Darts...). The band is starting to head in a more mainstream direction. This CD is good, but I'm worried that they will become progressively more poppish with each album.<br />There are alot of songs on Toxicity, such as Science, that succeed only because of one small section. Science would be a pretty boring song if it weren't for that awesome eastern sounding bit. The songs on the first album didn't need to be patched up to sound cool; they were brilliant to start with.<br />If you don't have the first CD and want to buy Toxicity, do yourself a favor and get the first one instead. Only buy this if, like me, you really like the first one and want more.
B000002UEB|5.0|This is by far one of the top three albums ever. When I mean album I mean the ENTIRE thing - the balance on this album is amazing. The story is unbelievable - this is a musical story - a heavy metal rock-opera. <BR>I could go on like crazy but a story about political corruption, brainwashing heroin addicts to kill religous figures around town.<BR>Amazing story - woudl love for it to be a book but afarid the book could not be good enough.<BR>My vote for the best concept album of all time
B00005JKBC|4.0|If I didn't know better -- I'd have thought the CIA actually wrote &amp; produced this movie.  How it played out is actually very different from the impression &amp; ideas I got from the commericials.  This is definitely a movie you do not want to miss a second of..... otherwise you may miss something and &quot;fall behind&quot;.  <br />A very good movie.... lots of action &amp; it keeps you guessing until the end.  I'll admit there are a few parts you kind of have to &quot;think your way through&quot; -- a little too much in my opinion.  Hence the reason it isn't 5 stars.
B000003N7G|5.0|John Coltrane was a thinker, never satisfied - a perfectionist, and he tried in his life to reach God.  He wanted to know and understand Him.  This album is really a big &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;praise&quot; to God.  Great jazz, one you can listen to all day.  So many ideas in his soloing, a true innovator.  Probably the John Coltrane album to get.  Great ideas, always fresh, and exciting.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This CD has lived in my car changer since I got it with the likes of the Pixies-Doolittle, Stones- Exile/Let it Bleed, Beck- Odelay and it holds it's own. Don't hesitate to pick this one up just watch your speed on the hwy, I found myself doing 100mph jumping around to Barely Legal last week. Great stuff.
B00005UK1F|5.0|In a perfect world I'd have heard of this album months ago and bought it the day it was released, so I would not have missed having it for so long. In the vein of A Pleasant Shade of Gray (by Fates Warning), Light of Day, Day of Darkness is entirely _one_ song, filling the album up to about 60 minutes. This is a fantastic, seemingly unheralded album.<br />I don't know who this Tchort guy is or what he's done in the musical world, but I'm convinced he's a talented man. This CD is his baby. &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot; plays out in ebbs and flows of aggressive, crunchy metal passages and gorgeous, placid soundscapes, with influences ranging from folk to gothic to ambient to opera. Instrumentation runs the gamut of a traditional metal lineup to a wealth of non-metal ingredients: strings, saxophone, sitar, opera choirs, children choirs. There is a lot of B3 organ which imbues a certain &quot;classic&quot; feel. Needless to say, this is not your run-of-the-mill CD.<br />Listening to this album is a dreamlike experience, even during the heavy moments (of which there are many). When you wake after a dream you try and recall details, and yet they elude memory. The first several listens of &quot;Light of Day, Day of Darkness&quot; are similar. When the album ends for the first time, you try to reassemble seemingly disparate musical threads in your mind, but they are fleeting. It takes many of listens to piece this album together entirely, for the cohesion is deeply hidden. Musical passages lead you on in a haze of multifaceted musical realms united through ingenious arrangements and creativity. Recurring motifs are very subtle, excepting the album's main theme which plays out several times. Often, unity is generated by reusing just a single bar, or reintegrating a 5-note melody on a different instrument. All the transitions are very smooth musically, and they seem more so because this is all happening on one track. (In contrast, the aforementioned A Pleasant Shade of Gray divides itself into 12 tracks to separate sections of the overall &quot;suite&quot; and so the listener can navigate to different parts easily. Dream Theater's recent &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; does the same thing.)<br />Naturally, it's much easier to describe a normal 5-minute -- or even 10-minute -- song than this 60-minute titan. It's just difficult to explain how it all comes together. You have your crunchy metal, and then there's myriad other elements looped around it. Some passages set grandiose string crescendos over pounding drums. Others have acoustic guitar with a delicate keyboard accompaniment. Some parts bring in weird, cosmic synthesizers. A big chunk of the 30-40 minute zone is taken up by misty sonics and a female vocalist singing wordless melodies (at one point she makes a weird fluttering effect with her voice). As the song goes through all these changes, Tchort orchestrates the movements with perfect build-up to heavier moments and skillful withdrawal into quiet passages. The &quot;flow&quot; of the song is just perfect.<br />The nondescript and deadpan vocals of Kjetil Nordhus work _perfectly_ with the overall sound. Outside of this album, I don't think I'd like them. One of those hyper-vibrato/falsetto power metal singers wouldn't have fit, that's for sure. When he sometimes gets drowned out by the metal sections, even this seems to fit within the album's dreamy context. He is not so much a _lead_ part of the music, but another thread in an elaborate tapestry. Some of the metal sections' rhythms come across a bit rigid because the drumming is sometimes amort (a few times I think I could predict the fills), but most of the riffs are heavy and memorable. At about the 16:00 mark, this killer riff comes in but it's only used briefly...too bad, because I liked it. Under this riff, the drumming continues to grow more intense until the heaviness retracts again.<br />Some night, jump in the car, throw Light of Day, Day of Darkness in the CD player, and drive around in the country for an hour. It will be a good experience.arkness in the CD player, and drive around in the country for an hour. It will be a good experience.
0792839730|4.0|...And that's the way it should be.  War is not a movie, in which one person stars, and everyone else is the supporting cast.  War is about teamwork, and ABTF showed it.  There were plenty of big names in the cast, but no one stood out.  It was probably meant to be that way, and that's what made the movie great.<br />Some of the scenes seemed to be reenacted quite faithfully, especially the Arnhem Bridge battle scene in which the German attempt to storm the British position was turned back.<br />The equipment is pretty authentic, although most Shermans were short-barreled, and I can't pick out what type of fighter-bombers the Allies used.  I am impressed by how the makers of the film managed to scrape together such a collection.<br />The acting (unlike Saving Private Ryan, for example) is more dramatic than realistic.  The blood and gore have been limited (like when the old lady walks out into the street and gets shot, but you don't see any bullet holes in her), but then this movie came out 25 years ago.
B00005RY7X|4.0|Whoever said that this disc was [bad] obviously does not know how to cut back and have some fun. Granted, many of the songs are basically the chorus repeated 4 times, and they often run together. But still, it is good for that kind of primal release where you can just let loose and \\"Party Hard\\" no matter what mood you are in. And it also provides a good soundtrack for going 90 miles per hour down I-70.
B00005UJBP|4.0|Yep,thats right,the Princess of Pop is back with her new CD 'Britney'...<br />Her Cd starts out with smash hit 'I'm a slave 4 U',then one of my favs,'Overpertected'.Other songs include:'Lonely','Boys','Not a Girl,Not yet a Woman','I love Rock n Roll',Cinderella','Let Me Be','Bombastic Love','Anticipating','That's Where you Take Me',and 'You don't know what it's like to be Me'.<BR> Also on this Asian import includes 2 new songs!These 2 are only on the Asian Import!The Songs are:'I Run Away' and my favorite 'When I Found You',this is definetly Britney's Best!<br />When I first got this I just listened to a couple seconds,and my first thought was,\\"I will NEVER listen to this again!\\".Her new album is so well, adult...Most of her fans are under 15,and practically anyone old enough to really understand her music thinks she is garbage,at when I first heard 'I'm a Slave 4 U',I agreed with them!<br />But after a while I decided to listen to it again,since I have been a big fan since her debut....Well,I put it in the player,and listen for a while and listened to it again several times and I realized that it wasn't bad,just not what I expected!<br />Although I still think some of the songs are trash,I have found many new favorites!<br />I you think she is great or even if you think she's trash,I think this is a good adition to anyone's music collection!<br />Just give her a chance!
0140277447|5.0|The author of this book, Iris Chang does a wonderful effort in detailing the horrible events in an eastern Chinese city under Japanese occupation in the late 1930s.  The slaughter that she describes really is hard to read due to the incredible evil that she detailed.  I must admit that I had almost no remembrance of this event from a history class, but after reading the book I doubt I will ever forget it.   This is a well written and fully documented book that details the story from the perspectives of the victims, the Japanese soldiers who committed the crimes, and western ex-patriots.   One of the more important parts of the book for me was explaining how the government of Japan had spent years dehumanizing its soldiers and creating an environment where these kinds of atrocities could take place.  If you are interested in World War 2 this would be a very interesting and new topic to read about.
B00005N9CV|1.0|Being a fan, I found myself horribly disappointed at this near &quot;elevator music&quot;.  For me, Diana Krall is a great pianist who can sing; not a great singer who can play piano.  Why these sappy arrangements?  Does popularity mean selling out to the mainstream?  Please get back to where you belong!
0385424736|3.0|Well its another McBook from the burn and turn factory know as Grisham Inc.  I am convinced he has a group of Santa's elf's slaving away in some South Carolina sweat shop turning these screen plays - sorry, I mean books out.   If you have read some of the authors books in the past you have a good idea of what you are going to get.   An easy to read and understandable book that is as light as cotton candy.  I actually think the movie was better.  Why do I read his books, for the same reason I eat junk food, it is easy to get, fast and not complicated.   Sometimes you just need a little light reading to take the stress from the day and his books fit that bill.
B00004XPP0|3.0|I'm a fan of the films as they were, not what Lucas intended them to be, or so he says.<br />In my opinion, Lucas added or replaced characters with CGI ... just so he could test pilot 'technology' that would be used in subsequent films.<br />The changes made turn Han from being a dangerous smuggler into someone that has survived because only far-sighted idiots have chased him across the galaxy ( I refer to the Greedo shoots first scene ).<br />The changes make the story inconsistent.  In episode 4 Jabba is a laid back, don't worry about it pal, when you get the chance dude, but a I'm going to send bounty hunters after you at the same time.  If he is so mad, then shouldn't he had offed Solo when they met in e. 4?<br />They also axed the classic ROTJ songs.  Again I feel that it was done as an excuse to show off what would and wouldn't work for episode 1.  Now that episode 1 is out, can we get the ORIGINAL trilogy?<br />IF dvds ever come out for this trilogy, I hope they have a 'watch the original movie' option.
0743216458|5.0|The author, Stephen Ambrose has become the preeminent American World War 2 historian, because of books like this one.   He details the life of a Company of Airborne solders from boot camp, D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge and ending at the Eagle's Nest.  This is a very gripping book, not because of the detailed battle scenes, but because of the human element Ambrose brings to the book.   His focus is the people involved, the average GI that was in high school 6 months earlier and how is the greatest conflict of their generation.  Due to the rather high casualty count in the company you do get a view of a number of characters, not just a few.      I cannot recommend this book as much as D-Day, but it is a great book for World War 2 buffs and general history readers alike.   It is just a very good, fast and engrossing book that will take you not time at all to read, as you will find it difficult to put down.
B00003CX5P|2.0|I was not that impressed with this move.  Everyone complains about Jar Jar and other very similar things, but I can look past that to some degree.  The main problems I saw were the following:<br />The 'force' was interesting as something mysterious but this movie knocked the foundation of my interest right out from under it.  This is a movie about Star Wars and some things need to exist without explanation.  Everyone in the SW universe grew up with that garbage as part of their fictional character's culture, so they do not need explanations of every little thing.  Besides, leaving some things unexplained lets the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination - as is the cast in the SW trilogy (before the special editing).<br />The story.  Yeah I'm not the first one to mention this, but you need more.  Darth Sidious' plot to come to power seems like a - ...I can't believe the cards are falling this way, I better cash in on this!' when it should show that he was behind the scenes in every little aspect.  That was a big dissapointment.  What is the deal with the 'chosen one' angle?  A setup for the obvious 'I don't need you/I'm better than you' conversion to the dark side that is sure to come?  In the movie, Anakin comes across as clumsily shooting a missle into the ship to destroy it from the inside out.  In the book, there was a little force action motivating him to do it.  I like the book better than the 'oops' feel that the movie gave.<br />My rants go on, but I'll just say that I'll probably read episode 2 and decide if I want to watch it.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I read the book for the movie \\"Spider-man: the adventures of Spider-man\\" by Micheal Tetelbaum ( it's about 144 pages ) and (sigh) let me tell you sumth'n you talkin bout sum gooooood readin! this book is off the hook! I hope the movie is exactly like it. the prolouge is just outstanding. and the story is even better!!!<BR> especially when peter  wrestles a wrestler by the name of \\"Bone-saw\\"!!! OOOppps!!! (Did i just say that?) watch the movie and see what happens next.
B00001ZWTT|2.0|First off, I like Will Smith but he had no business being cast as James West (originally played by Robert Conrad in the 60's series).<BR>Now on the other hand Kevin Kline being cast as Artemus Gordon (master of disguise) is a little more accurate and to the mark.<BR>What I'm saying is if I was a film director remaking something from<BR>another's work,I would try to make it as close to their work as possible. However Mr.Sonnenfield mis-directed this movie,it's an ok film but if  your expectations were as high as mine don't bother with this . Actually the only redeeming quality of this movie is Salma Hayek.  Oh yeah Sonnenfield also missed the mark with the Dr.Loveless character which originally was played by a dwarf in the original series. Hell give me the project, the dollars and the actors of my choosing and I'll make a movie people would enjoy<BR>Apologies for such a scathing revue. I hope Barry reads this!
B000002KB8|5.0|This album is where the legacy of Black Sabbath began. Just about every hard-rock/heavy metal band you listen to today borrows something from Black Sabbath. And with this CD, it's easy to see why and how they have had such an impact. &quot;Black Sabbath&quot; is, in my opinion, their most musically diverse album. From the bluesy &quot;The Wizard&quot; and &quot;N.I.B.&quot; to the doom-metal of &quot;Black Sabbath,&quot; you've got it all. This album proves everyone in Black Sabbath as a group of immensely talented individuals. Where would rock today be without Tony Iommi's infamous larger than life riffs be? Many argue that Led Zeppelin started the whole heavy metal movement, but I hear Black Sabbath's influence in a lot more bands today than I hear a Led Zeppelin influence. Another good point to this album is the transfer to CD. The sound is crisp and clear, especially when compared to the god-awful transfer of &quot;Master of Reality.&quot; This is one of those classic albums that no hard-rock fan should be without. I think everyone should own a copy.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Mulholland Drive is one of my favorite movies, but I regret that I cannot recommend buying the Mulholland Drive DVD. Though reasonable in theory, David Lynch's decision to present the entire film as one chapter on the DVD is in fact a terrible idea, for reasons of unfortunate technical reality.<br />If you a typical blundering idiot like me, you sometimes scratch a CD or DVD. If your DVD player finds a scratch, it can freak out and jump to the beginning of the current chapter. Woe be the David Lynch fan, for his scratch will deliver him back to the beginning of Mulholland Drive, from whence he has to fast-forward to find his place again. Talk about a breach of cinematic continuity.<br />My advice is to (a) rent it while some copies are still scratchless (b) buy it on VHS or (c) be vewwy cayfow with your Mulholland Drive DVD. Don't lend it to any David Cronenberg fans.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|anyone who thinks this movie was good or &quot;artistic&quot; is kidding themselves.
B000002LCU|5.0|In keeping up with the trends since this album first came out, I have owned 3 tapes (two broke after being played way too much) and have just bought one of the new CDs for sale on Amazon.  I cannot live without this CD.  It has helped me through the most difficult trials in my life; more than any other album, it is soothing to the soul.  I recommend the song \\"Just for Today\\"--it is pure musical therapy.  Most people are familiar with \\"I've Got My Mind Set on You,\\" but it's really just the tip of the iceberg.
B000062Y98|2.0|European metal outfit Blind Guardian has indeed put out an ambitious release in 2002. Recorded in Germany over most of 2001, Hansi Kursh (vocals) and Andre Olbrich (guitars) have done much of the creating. I must also say that Tom Stauch does a fine job on the drum kit. Who can I compare this to? I hear some Savatage in here, maybe a little Dream Theater in some of the guitar arrangements. But the vocals are what get me. If you are new to Bling Guardian, I guarantee it will take about a dozen spins to get used to Kursh's screaching... that is, IF you can get used to it. I've seen published magazine reviews using the words, &quot;monumental&quot;, &quot;masterpiece&quot;, &quot;majestic&quot;, &quot;ambitious&quot;, &quot;unbelievable&quot;... are these reviewers listening to the same CD I am? On the cover of the cd is a sticker that says &quot;BG is the most musically significant band since Iron Maiden&quot;. I am a huge Iron Maiden fan and I would never put Blind Guardian in the same league, group or class as Iron Maiden. I would recommend listening to this CD at the store. You'll find the music has numerous layers; it's hard, crisp and progressive. Then, focus on the vocals. Can you listen to this for 60-70 minutes at once? I gave this CD many repeated spins over 2 months and I decided that I could not. Perhaps the best thing about this release is the cover art by Paul Raymond Gregory.
B000002KO3|5.0|The greatest CD you have never heard. There is a reason why this CD is listed as a ton of 'must own' or 'greatest CDs ever' lists (Spin Mag, Rolling Stone etc). Amazing that a CD with such little radio play when it was released could strike such a chord with so many critics and fans alike. <br />I remember buying this album when I was about 14 years old after hearing Crosseyed and Painless on WNEW out of NYC. I was amazed by the sound that came out of my radio... funky yet urban. Between Brian Eno's production and Adrian Belew's guitar solo, I knew I had to OWN this album.<br />Side One was a masterpiece, containing only 3 long songs... but mind altering jams and amazing layers of what sounded like a million instruments playing at once made this one of the greatest album 'sides' ever. Side 2 ended with a song that scared the [heck] out of me... not really because of the lyrics, but instead the music was just plain haunting. <br />I can't believe this album is over 20 years old... this is still better than 99.9% of the music released today... and most of all, this does not sound dated by todays standards.
6304806418|5.0|I have to say that this is the best show adaptation to screen that I have seen yet. I mean, Jesus Christ Superstar and Fiddler on the Roof and all that are okay, but this shines above them all with it's stunning visuals, wonderful cinematography, and excellent casting choices. Though some people have some reservations about Madonna playing Eva Peron, I think she did an excellent job and she really worked to pull off the role well. And who can say more about Antonio Banderas as Che? He is the perfect actor for the part, displaying his range of talent from acting to singing to dancing. Though the movie does change some things from the original play production, I believe they are for the best. All the songs are included including a new one written for the movie, &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;. I was disapointed that this DVD doesn't have any special features what so ever, but I hope people will buy it for the movie itself instead of the special features. An excellent movie no matter what.
0316921173|4.0|\\"Infinite Jest\\" is a book that is difficult to describe. The three loosely intertwined plot threads involve an academy for teenage tennis prodigies, a halfway house for hard core drug addicts, and a political farce where a lounge singer becomes President and really cheeses off Canada. The narrative jumps around a lot, partly in time and often between different characters' viewpoints. The book meanders from the rituals of tennis drills to the harrowing binge stories of addicts to the brutal tactics of a group of wheelchair-bound Quebec separatists. It is engrossing but not casual reading. (It is also probably the best advertisement for Alcoholics Anonymous I can imagine, as the damaged addicts are irritated by the cheesy cliches that are heaped upon them, but after sticking with it and taking it One Day At Time they eventually are shocked to find that they no longer crave their Substance on a daily basis. Powerful stuff.)<br />The size of the book is daunting but after the first couple of hundred pages the fix kicked in and I was hooked. Also notable is the hundred pages of footnotes in the back of the book, which I found annoying. Maybe Mr. Wallace is getting kickbacks from the bookmark industry, I don't know. In an interview from Wisconsin Public Radio he says that \\"one of the neat things about having a footnote is it's a way to get kind of a double consciousness, or a sort of call-and-response on the page\\", and he does occasionally use the notes to comment on the text as if the narrator at that point in the book and the writer of the endnotes were different people. For me, though, it was a case of the format of the text distracting from the substance of the text.<br />It's hard to say if I could describe \\"Infinite Jest\\" as accessible. Some sections of the book are very funny or informative or moving; other chapters just seemed full of unnecessary detail. The detail builds up vivid pictures of the main characters and their existential crises, though, that really hit home with me after a while. At one point when a character cried, I cried too. One part of my fascination with the book comes from my emotional investment in the people trying to deal with their hard core addictions.<br />More of my fascination is with the book's self-referencing internal structure that is just begging to be analyzed and argued about. It's PhD-thesis fuel, this book.  The complexity is engrossing and humbling and confusing all at once. I love it that Mr. Wallace brought his considerable knowledge and skill to bear in his masterpiece here, but it was also clearly his intent to make a book that was captivating but not satisfying in a conventional way, leaving a lot of open questions and a need to re-read the book to be able to piece some things together.  How many \\"post\\"s do you have to put in front of \\"modern\\" to describe such a mind-bender of a novel?  Although \\"Infinite Jest\\" is meaty and thought-provoking and well worth reading, I was disappointed that something which takes such an effort to chew through didn't have an easily digestible payoff at the end.¹<br />I have a hundred other things I would like to say about the book, but I'll just stop here after gushing-with-reservations.  If you've got the time and gumption for it, do yourself a favor and read it.<br />¹ I suppose I am an example of one of the themes of the book, which is that Americans crave easy entertainment to an extreme degree.t home with me after a while.

B000063CPL|4.0|I've been a Maiden fan since 1982. They have always been one of the tightest, most impressive live performing bands in Heavy Metal. It's now 2002, and not much has changed. Sure, their older, and not quite as tight, but they still [rock] on this \\"Rock In Rio\\". It's without question the best live recording they've done since \\"Live After Death\\".<br />The set list is questionable in my opinion, and that's why I only gave this four stars. The production is surprisingly very good. I was worried this may be another dead one....It's not. <br />The addition of guitarist J. Gerrs still annoys me though, and I wish he would let Maiden move on without him. A. Smith is the key ingredient in Iron Maiden in my opinion, and he wrote many of the greatest songs Maiden has ever released. His absence of influence on BNW was very disappointing to me. Adrian makes Maiden the very best they can be. Throwing Janick into the mix, just makes them sound off key to me. He sounds good on \\"Rock In Rio\\", but when he starts playing Adrians leads, I get very angry. <br />All in all, I highly recommend this Iron Maiden release. It will be followed by the \\"Rock In Rio\\" DVD. This release poves that Heavy Metal isn't dead, and that as long as Maiden are still around, it will never die!!!.....UP THE IRONS!!!
0446608955|5.0|After reading &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; I was left in tears.  This book was one of the best books I've ever read. I'm 15-years old and I'm not one of read many books but if I do it takes me a very long time. This book took me only a couple of hours to complete because I could not put it down. Nicholas Sparks did an excellent job of portraying the heartbreak and happiness that love brings. I recommend this book to anyone who believes in the power that love can bring.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I like deep movies, i like artsy movies, i like thinking movies. This is none of those. This is over-hyped garbage. Blue Velvet, good movie. Not great, but good. Every other thing this man has done is [junk]. He is laughing at all of us. I can only hope he is doing an experiment to prove to everyone, that a man can make movies that stink, and if he packages them well enough, he can convince everyone he is a genius. That.....is David Lynch's only genius.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|Let's start with the positives, shall we? The choreography, costuming and (some) of the characterizations were excellent. I particulary liked John Leguizamo as Toulous Latrec (how'd they shrink him?) and Nicole Kidman as Satine. Now for the downside. The first part dragged on forever and was just too trite. Is it just me, or is historical accuracy in music when a historical period is being depicted at least a little important? I don't know if the original songs they performed at the Moulin Rouge were lost, burned in a fire, or what, but I think there should be enough Parisian history to find out what type or genre of songs they actually performed back then. Some burlesque songs, perhaps. The pop songs and lyrics just confuse and clutter up the story. They should make a DVD with just the very beginning and the second half, cutting out all the pop sentiment and possibly including more songs from the era. I will make one exception for Lady Marmelade. That should be kept for the ending.
B00000K31Q|3.0|After nearly ten years directing TV shows and pilots, this was Gil Junger's first shot at a feature film.  Not bad.  Because it was based off a Shakespearean play, it doesn't seem as contrived as most recent teen genre movies -- but don't let that fool you.  It still manages to be contrived, but in a fun way.  This film does what it's supposed to do -- entertain young people.  I mean, what do you expect out of it -- Shakespear?
B00000AFFF|5.0|This album is so great I almost cry everytime I hear it.Burt's songs can be a bit sappy at times.Hey Im into that and Elvis can pull those love songs off.Take my word for it give this CD a listen.
078322608X|5.0|If you haven't seen Chris Marker's \\"La Jetee,\\" please do so.  \\"La Jetee\\" was made in 1962, and \\"12 Monkeys\\" is an up-to-date adaptation of the cult favorite short film.  This film has all the elements to provide the audience with an amazing experience -- mental illness, animal rights, time travel, apocalyptic themes.  This film is all about the perception of time and the illusion of it -- not to mention a look at society.  It arises questions of existence, the thought that perhaps those in mental institutions are not the ones who are crazy, and sheds light on a possible fate for a not-so-distant future.  This is definately a masterpice with great acting, a terrific story, and is beautifully shot.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I saw this lovely creature on late night television once and was compelled to buy the cd and see what else was on it... I am amazed. Norah has such a sweet and beautiful voice. I am not really into a lot of the &quot;new&quot; jazz artists, usually I just stick with the classics, but this disc has not been far from the cd player since I purchased it. Definately worth a listen.
B0000542DG|3.0|\\"Final Destination,\\" directed by James Wong, has an intriguing concept and a strong start. High school student Alex (played by Devon Sawa) has a horrific premonition which is ultimately instrumental in saving the lives of himself and a number of others. But have they cheated death? Or is there an even more horrible fate in store for each of them?<br />I found \\"Final Destination\\" to be an oddly uneven film. Director Wong helps create a genuinely creepy atmosphere; I especially liked the way ordinary household items and actions are invested with an ominous weight. But some aspects of the film struck me as inappropriately humorous, leading me to wonder if I was watching an intentional spoof or if the filmmakers were just slipping up in moments of ineptitude.<br />I found the tone of the film inconsistent. Were they trying to create a serious psychological drama in which the viewer is meant to care about the characters, or rather should the viewer view Alex and the others as mere fodder for yet another \\"slasher\\"-style horror pic? I was also disappointed by the ending.<br />One of the best aspects of \\"Final Destination\\" is the strong work by its ensemble cast, which includes Kerr Smith and Kristen Cloke. Sawa in particular makes a sympathetic leading man. His solid performance carries much of the film; he is definitely a young actor worth following. Give \\"Destination\\" a try.
B00004XQP4|5.0|I thought Green Day would not be able to make a better album than 'Nimrod'- but alas they have. From the first listen this album grabs you with it's melodic hooks. Admittedly, it's a lot less heavier than earlier albums, and whilst not departing completely from the formula that made them huge, 'Warning' is definitely their most progressive and mature work to date. It's hard to pick a favourite song, but 'Castaway', 'Macy's Day Parade' and 'Fashion Victim' are standouts. The live versions of 'Brat' and '86' are a great addition also. Do yourself a favour, get this album, pump up the stereo, and enjoy the magic of Billie Joe &amp; Co.
0967984602|5.0|Brilliant, ..... well worth the investment. Easy to read and understand. Great ideas for designs. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to build an outdoor earth oven.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Okay, let's set the record straight, and give some insight on some ways that I believe this movie could have been better. For starters, was the director or whoever was in charge of dialogue in the right state of mind when they made the line &quot;you're gonna need more than that crotch rocket&quot;. Let me just say that the Honda CBR 900RR that Johnny Tran was riding would have smothered the tar out of Dominic's ride. And though Dominic wasn't speaking to Lance, the Yamaha YZF R1 he was riding would have incinerated Dominic. I am an avid bike rider, so I KNOW these things to be true. One complaint I had was, why didn't they have the mother of all super sport bikes on the film? The Suzuki GSX-R 1000 is without a doubt the hottest bike on the market. How else can you refer to a machine that weighs a feathery 374 lbs. (dry), and can go a quarter mile in 9.74 seconds at approx. 144 mph. Given, that cars weigh a lot more than bikes and can still run at fast speeds, but my argument is that the dialogue personnel was way outta line.
B000003NA3|5.0|I love John Coltrane very much, and his musics means much to me with its ernest and honest approach.  Moreover, the music contained on this box set holds a special place in my memory over the years....This box set helped me get an introduction to Coltrane (more than listening to blue train, of course).  This and Live @ Birland helped me see the depth of Coltrane's music and dive deeper and deeper into freer more modal music. I must also mention that Dolphy (who I have to plug -->several good solo records, too)  adds and excellent playful counter voice to coltrane's much more serious and meditional feel. Even though I  generally perfer the heavier modal material at this point; I still find it necessary to pay homage to these discs on a regular basis...
B00005JKJA|5.0|I have to admit, it's a very well put together piece of cinema and it has a finally apparent, though certainly not pervasive, clarity and message.  Beautiful.<BR>But.<BR>It is really pretentious, and that is reflective of Lynch's maddened little artiste's ego.  Whatever you say about Mulholland Drive's message about the moral malleability of Hollywood and how it strives to twist human issues for monetary gain, Lynch only portrays this message on a level visible to those educated in the cryptography of the arthouse film.  He doesn't, and never has cared to speak to an intellectual audience that is interested in smart films but doesn't have the time to sit through unending viewings of Eraserhead and Begotten. There's a certain amount of talent involved in making a film palatable, and I would say that Lynch has decided to distance himself from it in order to create for himself a dedicated fan base who in good turn built him an ivory tower.  <BR>Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the film.  The casting was spot-on and the acting was excellent.  But Dune was execreble and nothing's ever going to change that.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Ok so i thought his was going to be a good movie but i was soooooooooooooo disapointed like many fans. Kill Jar jar there is a lot of holes between this one and episode 4 queen amidala will almost get killed before episode4 so why not kill jar jar. Portmans dialog was so monatone that it dove me carzy it that there accent to have no emotion in there voice. jake loyd should of gone to acting school of had more trainers. I would much rather see a giant puppet (chewbacca) than jar jar at least chewie felt like a real person and he added somthing to the story and lukas didn't try to overuse him. <BR>this movie was a sad chapter in this saga i hope that the next one will have a story and emotion.<BR>THEY SHOULD OF JUST THROWN 150 MILLON ON A TABLE AND LET US WATCH IT FOR 2 HOURS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT THE FILMAKERS BASICALY DID. OHH CAN WE PLEASE SEE ANOTHER C.G. SHOT UHHHH IT GOT OLD.
0395645662|3.0|Take a close look. This encompasses the central theme of the book. At some point, people realized that all kinds of sin and strife sprang from differences and envy. And so they removed color. The book never explains quite how- it's not pure science fiction but more of a mix with fantasy. But there are two in the society that can always see in color. And they are the ones who remember pain, for without pain you can not truly make wise decisions.<br /><br />Now that cuts to the wick. You don't expect something so deep in a children's novel that puts the novel into a category of not only readable for adults, but one adults *should* read. Lowry very realistically describes the process of emerging color-sight, describing what it is like for the first time to truly see after all your life living in a society of black and white. In the process she reveals, if it is our differences which cause the strife between us, perhaps the removal of those differences is too great a price to pay. And perhaps pain itself is too great a thing to lose if it means a life of mediocrity and forgetfulness. For with much pain also comes much Joy.<br /><br />I wrote this review before there was a hint of two sequels, and hence was forced o give it the low rating.  Without the sequels, it is incomplete.  The Giver will stick with you; you will remember it's myth. But embrace it as an unfinished story until you've read the sequels.
B00005T30L|1.0|OK, Scarlett Johansson is very sexy in this movie, and the 80's guy (complete with mullet hair) got a snicker out of me, but most of all this movie is missing a plot. The main characters drone on in their meaninless lives cursing a lot. After watching, you aren't uplifted in any way or even challenged to think about anything, you are just depressed. It is a very slow moving and maybe I just don't get the 'art' of it. I just think it was boring.
B00003CXTG|2.0|Although this would have made a great science fiction film, it was billed as being based on a true event -- Pearl Harbor.  Maybe their overdoing of everything was to appeal to a younger generation of movie-goers, but this epic is executed like an over-budgeted music video.  Why oh why didn't Jerry Bruckheimer make this movie like Black Hawk Down (which had some of the same actors and a similar 'military tragedy' plotline).  However, two stars are deserved SOLELY for the hospital scene, which I thought was excellent, yet it was only a small fraction of the film.
B00005U11Z|5.0|If you love Journey, you will love this video. The 'new' Steve does a great job. A great show from one of rock's all time best bands.
B000001FRY|5.0|If you like All That You Can't Leave Behind, you'll love Boy.  U2's first album from 1980, it stands up to this day and does not sound 20 years old.  It captures the band as they struggle with becoming adults, and is one of the most open and vulnerable album you'll hear.  Bono is earnest and honest in his lyrics, the Edge's guitar is raw and powerful, and the rythym of Adam and Larry keeps the record moving.  <br />&quot;I Will Follow&quot; and &quot;Out of Control&quot; are two of U2's best live tunes, and the record manages to capture their live sound in the studio.  An Cat Dubh/Into the Heart are two songs sown together in a weave of sonic textures and rock beats with chiming bells and guitars.  This is a record you'll play again and again, and you'll wonder how you've lived so long and not heard it already.<br />And you can hear the sound that influeces some of today's promising new bands like Travis, Coldplay and Flickerstick.  While you wouldn't know this band would one day rule the world when it came out, it does reveal their essence.  Thier just four friends who want to make music together.  After two decades, things haven't changed, and they still haven't found what they're looking for.
B000002IGV|1.0|If the band members had enough collective brains to either write songs, or sing tongue in cheek, this would merely be a very bad album.<br />As it is, however, they unknowingly caricature themselves.  Stop for a minute and ask yourself: How many countries in the world could produce a band like this?<br />One of the few things worse than this album is any of their putrid videos.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Love this album! First heard of John Mayer on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and I couldn't keep my eyes off the tv. He was playing No Such Thing (which is my favorite). So I finally got the CD and I'm giving it 4 stars because there are like one or two songs I don't click with but the rest of it are stellar! Just his voice makes the songs great (aside from the great lyrics, great guitar playing, etc.) I wish more artists would play this type of music because it sounds more real compared to Britney Spears and those manufactured pop-stars...

B00000064E|5.0|We are so lucky to be alive in an age of recorded sound. Artists such as the Beatles, Bob Marley, Bob Dylan, and Nick Drake will live forever and sing to each new generation. Do yourself a favor and pick up all of Nick's albums. He was an amazing songwriter, superb guitarist, and oh...what a golden voice. I cherish all his recorded work and you will too. I hope you're in a good place Brother Nick.
B000002UVZ|5.0|&quot;Murmur&quot; and &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; get most of the attention from the critics, and deservedly so.  They are two great albums that deserve their place in the top lists of 80 and early 90s albums.  However, I personally believe this album ranks right up there.  You don't hear this album mentioned at all, and yet it has some of REM's finest songs... &quot;I Believe&quot; &quot;Fall On Me&quot; &quot;Swan Swan H&quot; &quot;Begin the Begin&quot; &quot;Cuyohoga&quot; &quot;Superman&quot;... heck, every song is a winner.  I remember this as the album that first introduced me to REM, and it is still the one that I look for when I want to get my CD case loaded with good music for a road trip.  It is beyond my imagination why it has never gotten the respect it deserves.
B000002B2X|5.0|If you like Alice in Chains and do not have this CD, then BUY it!<BR>I've always like their music but I never really listened to this CD until on a road trip to Mammoth Mountain. My cousin had it in his SUV and once I listened to it, I had to buy it.<BR>It's a short CD, but it's worth the money. Too bad they broke up.
B000065U1N|4.0|Alot of viewers of Black Hawk Down claim that it lacked substance, plot structure, and character development. I guess in a way you could say that. Then again, if you want to see another war love story i'd recommend Pearl Harbor or something along those lines, but if you want a realistic war movie? Hawk emphasizes more on the important realism of the events in Mogadishu than anything else. This was a war movie for war movies. And the characters were brilliant, acting as real soldiers would in this scenario. Overall, Hawk was a good war movie, but still not the best.
B00003CY0V|2.0|No.  Borrow it for the ten seconds that you want to watch.  You know which 10 I speak of.<br />Not worth it.
B00005QFHG|2.0|DO NOT READ THE NOVEL BEFORE YOU SEE THE MOVIE!<BR>The movie is a cute little piece, but a pale imitation of the novel. The producer tried to capsule the story on his own terms, and failed.<BR>   The biggest mistake is replacing the priest with the mayor, as the Advesary of the character played by Juliette Binoche.  Ms. Binoche did a fine job in her role, but her role was toned down and so stripped of the mystic and magic of the novel.<BR>   I realize it is a challenge to capsule a 300 page novel in a two hour film.  However, the producer would have done better by sticking more to the original theme of freedom versus tyranny of religion.<BR>   Let me warn you in even sterner terms.  If you read the book, don't see the movie.  If you see the movie, don't read the book.

014100018X|5.0|I read this book, and then rented the video. I made a mistake.  This book stands on its own, as one of the most enchanting I've read. The movie is a pale imitation.<BR>   The author's use of descriptive adjectives surprasses any book I can recall.  I found myself enthralled and unable to stop reading.  (I also found myself with a very strong craving for chocolate).<BR>   As a retired Episcopal Priest I was enthralled by the battle between the Priest and the Heroine.  (I laughed so loudly at religion and the institutional church's narrow and unholy view of life and reality).  My wife is now reading this delightful novel, because she hadn't heard me laugh like that in some time.<BR>   It is indeed a work which does not provide all the answers, and rightly so.  I hope the author does a sequel.  I will read it hot off the press.<BR>    Meanwhile, I think I'll get myself another helping of candy!

B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's subversive and compasionate film is his most coherent ever. It's the story of two women with very different agendas. One deeply personal and the other one ruthlessly professional. When these two worlds collide, the results are tragic. I wouldn't say that this film is a criticism of Hollywood as a previous reviewer did - that would be too literal - I think it's more about what happens when passions run too deep and people loose their way in a world of self made delusion.
0140067477|3.0|This book is cute, and I enjoyed many parts of it, but....<br /> He  wrote the book from a western-Philisophical stand point but he gleened items from religious/folk Taoism as it suited his needs. This is not a useful approach, as I am CERTAIN that he and most all of the fans of this book would reject religous/ folk Taoism. <BR>It is not that you cannot find use in folk Taoism... but the way that he presented \\"his\\" Taoism as a *total religion* quite was misleading. Perhaps he is just hoping that the American readers will be to azy to research Taoism any further *shrug*<BR>But he made a huge mistake in presenting all things classified as \\"taoist\\" as being infalliable and all other things... not.<br /> He often criticised other religions, but, having opened up the folk-Taoist \\"can of worms\\" he opened Taoism to a scrutiny in which it would fare no better than any other doctrine (mind you that Taoism has been around for thousands of years, and it is no fault to Taoism that it has picked up \\"[stuff]\\" along the way.... however Hoff used examples that I would put in the \\"[stuff]\\" catagory).<BR>Hoff spoke of being \\"playful\\" and tried to be playful, but I found much of that to be forced, or trite in the least. There were many bitter and non-playful parts to the book as well. <BR>He \\"playfully\\" mocked and degraded 90% of the residents on planet earth in one way or the other.  I actually found the book to be rather severe!<br />In presenting it as a doctrine with a set of beliefs and folk-stories, Taoism gains the same problems as any other religion.<BR>Although he repeatedly denounces dogma, he makes a dogma of Taoism.<br />I also didn't get to pooh/Taoism parallel except in the most superficial sense... the actual Winnie the Pooh stories include Pooh doing some quite un-Taoist things. He does have Tao-spirit though, I admit. :)
B00005RHF8|2.0|I was so excited to see that this wonderful made-for-tv movie had been released on DVD.  What a horrible shock it was to see that the print the DVD was created from was in terrible condition.  Whole scenes are missing.  The dialog jumps around.  The screen goes completely black in the middle of a scene for a good three seconds.  There are scratch lines throughout the film.  <BR>The &quot;original&quot; film itself I give 5 stars (from memory).  The DVD -- doesn't deserve a single star.  Shame on the production company for not remastering this brilliant film.<BR>If you love Jane Eyre, these performances in this are well worth watching, but find a different copy.
B00005NNT1|2.0|I am not even a Barbra-hater... I kind of like her sometimes.<br />But that version of \\"someday my prince will come\\" is so horrible I have to dive at the VCR to make sure I am not tortured by a single note of it. <BR>I don't think I have ever hated a song so much.<br />The kids like it. <BR>Actually my 2 1/2 year old wont watch it because it is too \\"scary\\" but, I expect she'll like it someday. <br />I think the color might have been better on this version of Snow White. That was nice, though I couldnt really tell.
B00005JKJA|3.0|but also hard to stop watching!<br />I generally am not a fan of Lynch's work.  I think his movies are extremely bizarre and the story always hard to follow because of the weird fashion they seem to be in.<br />While this movie did have me totally lost, I was intrigued by the story. Naomi Watts plays &quot;Betty&quot;, a fresh faced girl who has just moved to L.A. to make it as an actress.  I appreciate films about the making of actors, but this goes beyond that. She meets &quot;Rita&quot;, who has been involved in a nasty car accident(This is the start of the film). Rita has lost her memory, and Betty decides to help her figure out who she is.<br />Do we really ever find out who &quot;Rita&quot; really is?  I watched this movie three days ago, and I still don't know.  This movie was confusing, really confusing.  I think they were going back and forth in time, but the viewer doesn't really know for sure.  At least I didn't.<br />There are some really strange characters, as with every Lynch project, that join Betty and Rita along the way to figuring out the truth about Rita's life. This is a twisted tale of Hollywood.<br />Both actresses were excellent, and Justin Theroux, who plays a director in the film, was very good. I just saw him in a play in Boston, and he is a great actor.<br />It's been so long since I've watched any of Lynch's other work, but I think only diehard fans of his will truly appreciate this film.  It's extremely hard to follow but at the same time it's interesting.  I found myself engrossed in it, and wanting to know what the turnout would be.  I'm still trying to figure it out.
B00003CXXP|3.0|The fatal flaw of this film is in the fact that its premises are only partially thought-out...and this is bad news, especially when you're dealing with a &quot;thought-provoking&quot; movie.<br />Um...if scientists were smart enough to program &quot;love&quot; into a robot, wouldn't they also be smart enough to omit depression?  That seems logical.  And surely somebody would have the foresight to give robots some sort of &quot;shelf-life,&quot; so that they wouldn't just fumble around moping and sad for the rest of eternity...  <br />Also, if you were a parent looking to buy a robot to replace your own son, wouldn't you WAIT to see whether your own kid was going to pull through or not?!?  That was silly.  And don't you think that the instruction manual would say something about your robot boy's eating habits?<BR>&quot;Does he eat?&quot;<BR>&quot;I dunno...&quot;<BR>Hmmm...and it certainly seems strange to me that the scientists would have built a swallowing mechanism into a robot that wasn't supposed to eat...<br />Here's another one: wouldn't robots be given some sort of outer sign to differentiate them from &quot;real people,&quot; ESPECIALLY if one of our favorite pasttimes was blowing them up?!?!?  Nobody seemed too concerned when an apparently real boy was spotted in the cannon-fodder cage at Lollapalooza...<br />Furthermore, if the robot-boy's creator wanted him to know how to find him, why didn't he just e-mail him directions or something?!?  Instead we get the cryptic riddle arbitrarily placed in Dr. Know...something about &quot;Weeping tigers at the end of the world.&quot; <br />There were lots and lots of cognitive irritants in the move like these that I've mentioned--some more grating than others.  I liked the look of the film, and the atmosphere was very Kubrick, but the hole's in the plot were inescapable.
B00005RY7X|4.0|In this era of derivative, angst-filled studio rock (linkin park, staind, etc.) where every rock album with any merit, no matter how small (Strokes, White Stripes, etc.) is lauded as the second coming of R.O.C.K., comes a fresh rcord with no pretension and real promise of saving a dying sound. <br />Andrew WK is not about composing the next great musical exploration. <BR>He is not about wowing the musical elite with complex time signatures and obscure tunings.<BR>Andrew WK is about party. <br />I Get Wet is a 12 song explosion of basic rock chords, simple song structures and lyrics about drinking, partying and having fun. With heavily layered trebly guitar and driving beat, these tracks lower the top and blow out the speakers. The addition of a slight electro undertone with rhythm keyboard and subtle phaseshifting makes the record complete.<br />The one flaw is that the simplicity of the tracks make sthe record blend together somewhat. Each single stands on its own, but all sound very similar. Still though, check your indie pretensions at the door and raise a fist for Andrew WK.<br />Easily the best cover art of the year as well.
B000005QH3|4.0|Three films in one: existential art film, car chase exploitation fare, counterculture political statement.<br />I prefer its existential aspects, which hold up best. It may have been a great car chase film for its time, but special effects stunt technology has long since surpassed it. And its counterculture aspects, while historially interesting, are dated. But it remains thought-provoking in its existential philosophizing.<br />Big question, which remains unanswered: Why does he decide to speed across the American west? No easy answers. The bet is just his excuse. And why the ending? (I won't include a spoiler, but it's surprising and intriguing).<br />Film has a great soundtrack. Years ago, it was released on CD in Brazil, and there was reputed to be a limited European CD Club edition. Now out of print, used copies sometimes go for [a lot of money]<br />Entertaining, historically interesting, and thought-provoking.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I was a mild fan of &quot;The Bends,&quot; and taking the advice of a friend, I decided to expand my CD collection with OK Computer. The first time through was a complete disappointment. I simply did not know to what I was listening.<BR>After days, perhaps even weeks, stuck between seat cushions, I providentially decided to take the album as one of 4 CD's that would accompany me on a leisurely trip to Seattle and Canada. <BR>It was on this trip that I underwent a change, a musical catharsis if you will. While on a ferry going from Victoria Island to Vancouver, I found myself on deck at the bow listening to the album on my headphones. The sky was cloudy and the sun was nowhere to be seen. My vision was filled only with the rippling and seemingly endless sea; I tasted the mist on my tongue and smelled the sea breeze through my nostrils; I felt the cold air brush against my face. Four of my five senses were thus occupied, and the final sense, as though it were the will of God, was completely in tune with all of the others listening to the alternating chimes of &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien,&quot; and for one of the few times in my life, I was in the middle of a full somatic experience. <BR>From there, I could not get enough of Radiohead and their collective musical genius. I think my aforementioned friend put it best when he said, &quot;Never before have I fallen this hard for a band before,&quot; and OK Computer is top on my list of their albums, and of any musician's albums for that matter.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I loved it so much that I plan to buy it.  First of all, get it on DVD so you can see all the extra stuff, including the director's comments.  Second, watch this movie more than once.  Than visit their website.<br />This movie was described as &quot;American Beauty meets the Twilight Zone&quot;.  That it was.  It is not your run of the mill typical movie.  There is a lot of depth and hidden things in it.  It has already been described by other reviewers.  I would just like to say that this movie is FANTASTIC!<br />BTW, the song Mad World is AWESOME, and the video clip on the DVD is even better.<br />Finally, I want to end with I am not a teen ... I am 35 and still think this is a great movie.
0345363132|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it on the advice of an intelligent, well-read friend who has yet to steer me wrong.  I was a little concerned, however, that I knew so little about the time period in which the book was set -- England's War of the Roses.  Those concerns drifted away as I got more and more into the book.  What beautiful writing!  What clear analysis of the political machinations of the 15th century!  What human-ness Penman gives her characters!  Those reviewers who have called this book a &quot;tour de force&quot; are completely correct.  This is a great, illuminating book, and one I am glad to have read.
B00005K3OT|4.0|This movie is so cool I can hardy stand for it!  I like how the sexy lady comes to town and make all the dumb church people have sex!!!  That is so cool.  Chocolate is a well-known afrodesiac, you know.  And chruch people need to get a lif!!!!This was my favorite movie of all times beside Cidor House Rules and Goodwill Hunting which also is good.  This movie has a good moral that people should [have more fun]!  Plus I like the seenary.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Just a great albumn.  The best I have heard in a while.  Great simple, catchy melodies.  Just right for summer.  It has just enough backbone to elevate it above plain pop.  I have tried, but I cannot get it out of my player.<br />Sounds a little like DMB with better song writing and better guitar work.  A little SRV and Dunkan Sheik mixed in for good measure.  The lyrics rival Ben Folds for memorable modern poetry.  Simply a wonderful album.
1565846117|4.0|Older readers will recall the fine series of police procedurals featuring the Swedish policeman Martin Beck.  These books, by the Swedish writers Wahloo and Sjowall, were nice combinations of crime fiction and social commentary.  The Kurt Wallender series by Henning Mankell is a worthy successor to the Martin Beck books.  The stories are well plotted with good characterization and an interesting central character.  As with the Martin Beck books, an underlying theme is the reality of Swedish life as opposed to the goals of socialism.
078324228X|5.0|The Hurricane was and outstanding film, i think everyone should see it. It goes back to the 60's where white people hated black's. In the movie Rubin Carter was wrongfully accused for a crime he didnt do, and Carter trys to get out of prison, and then comes along some freinds from Cananda who save him, it's awesome!! What ever you do, dont miss out on this great film. You'll love it!!!
B00005JKBC|3.0|Apparently some DVD players will display closed-captioning (very annoying since it's in about 1000-point type) every time a scene changes on this DVD.  We tried two different copies from Blockbuster (happened on the store's player as well), as well as a purchased copy.  It happened every time.  A friend tried our purchased copy, and it didn't happen. His DVD player was new last Christmas; ours is two years old.  We finally saw the movie all the way through on VHS with no problems.  We've written Universal Studios about the problem but have not heard back. Be aware of this possible glitch between the disk and your player when you purchase!
0553801481|4.0|I've been reading Robin Hobb since she was Megan Lindholm (and now recognised as such); her early books were aimed at a younger audience, but had that certain appeal that set her apart from the run-of-the-mill authors. <BR>The Six Duchy saga is on a different plane, appealing to a more mature audience who wish something to get their imaginations' teeth imto, and she has done it again with the Tawny Man - although it doesn't seem like it during the first 1/3rd of the book ... <BR>15 years have passed since Fitz's last adventure (he is now known as Tom), so the telling of this has to be done subtly, to avoid those boring resumes that we often get; the Fool too has changed in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways and seems intent on being as manipulative as Chade. <BR>The threads that are brought together during the latter part of the book promise an adventure just as good as the other 2, especially as we seem to be drawing both previous series to a common point (which may have been guessed at from the previous frontispiece maps).<br />There are many unanswered questions as well: who or what is the Fool &amp; is it male or female? Where does Hap fit in? Starling is more than she appears; Why is the Fool's horse called Malta? Treasure Beach hints at another connection; Wit &amp; Skill - same or different?<br />By the end of the book, one is left wondering which will be next - a further episode of Tawny Nan, the Liveship Traders sequel, or a new series about the OutIslanders?<br />Ms Hobb has fashioned one of the most believable worlds in modern fantasy - on a par with George RR Martin's Song of Ice &amp; Fire - the characters are 3-dimensional, hidden traits appearing unexpectedly, and not all of them perfect, as so often happens in lesser tales.<br />I can't say much more without 'spoilers', so I leave it to you to persevere with the first part of the book, your persistance will be rewarded!

The two minutes of cricket noises at the end are a bit mcuh though. Nevertheless, one of the songs that will make Incubus great.
6304779607|2.0|Stallone's prefermance was surprisingly strong as this twisted tale bombed. Stallone as usual plays a one-man army placed against a cult of neo-fascist revolutionaries, who like to kill attractive women with claw-like metal slashing devices. Stallone is a rogue policeman on a squad nobody likes, the zombie squad. The zombie squad is a small composition of individuals who handle terriosts usually armed with weapons and hostages. (Cobra is merely the name of Sylvestor Stallone's character.)<br />As for these neo-fascists, strange seens show them clanging their weaopons in large groups making it seem that they are praying to their leader. By the way, the implied leader speaks a total of four or five lines and always seems to be driping with sweat. <br />Now, as for how these two groups (the neos and Stallone) came together was merely a clash of occupation. One girl who was targeted to be killed by the neo-fascists escaped and Stallone was giving the seemingly easy and boring task of guarding her.<br />Cobra is action packed with violence, gore, and loads of weapons, orthodox and un-. If your in for a decent 80's flick Cobra would be the place to look.
B00004U8P9|5.0|Something different, something wild. Not your typical show. A Cult Classic that keeps on bring them back for more. If you like something not so traditional this is the show for you. Filled with an all star cast that sings and acts, Tim Curry, Meatloaf, Susan Sarandon and more. For those that want to get totally involved promps and behind the scenes looks are all included in the fun. It's diffinitely a timewarp of fun and laughs as men in lingere put on a show. It feel good singalong show of fun. After all what other show do you get to actual do more than sit, waterguns and newspapers, clapping and more. Different is good. Come find out what everyone else has been talking about and what you have been missing. It here to stay and will never fade for there is nothing quite like this! So find you favorite corsett, teddy and high heels and join in the fun!

6304082428|4.0|Although this is as good a version of Pride and Prejudice as there is likely to be, the quality of the tapes supplied to me was disappointing.  The sound quality is subpar:  in places the sound track is out of sync and distorted.  And the color tones are inconsistent, so adjustment is needed from scene to scene.  Watching these tapes was definitely less enjoyable than watching the original.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is for the people of the world that love to laugh. Filled to the brim with good old british humor that appeals to us all. Great for young and old - something all will love. If you have seen anything by Monty Pythons and loved it this is the best. Every time I find new laughs and old ones too! The behind the scenes info is great, and almos unbelievable that most of it was filmed all in one castle. And then of course there is the educational film that all must see &quot;How to use your coconuts&quot;! After you pass Coconuts 101 you can sing along with Sir Robin and all your other favorites.  A must for any Monty Pythons fan!!
B00005QDW1|2.0|After listening to No Doubt's latest offering, \\"Rock Steady\\", I couldn't help but think how every album by them is worse than the one before. No Doubt's self-titled major label debut in 1992 was a fun and refreshing album. Tragic Kingdom, although more commercial sounding than their self-titled, had it's own feel and managed to grow on me. No Doubt's last album had a few decent songs, but nothing that jumps out as a classic. The first thing that No Doubt needs to do is take a page from Weezer's book of success and employ Ric Ocasek to produce an entire album for them instead of a few songs like \\"Rock Steady\\" does. Ocasek's offering, as well as a song from the Artist (Prince), are ear catchers. No Doubt seems to be gearing their music towards the hip huggers, Saturday afternoon at the mall and Saturday night cruisin' crowd instead of its die hard fans. But  this is a disappointing album from a talented band that needs to begin pleasing it original fans from the late 80's and early 90's instead of the ones born then before it's too late.
B000002GK1|4.0|Although it was their third album, it was &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; that really jump-started Soundgarden's career, both commercially and creatively.  The psychedelic-influenced riff-rock that made &quot;Superunknown&quot; both a smashing success and and a metal masterpiece was first developed here.  &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; starts off on a rollicking note with &quot;Rusty Cage,&quot; an anthemic number which boasts one of the fastest and catchiest guitar riffs I can think of.  They shift direction on the next track, the single &quot;Outshined,&quot; a slower track with a griding, sludgy riff behind Chris Cornell's masterful wailed vocals.  &quot;Slaves and Bulldozers&quot; continues in a similar direction, with another sludgy riff and more melodic vocals from Cornell.  The band ventures more into psychedelia in the middle part of the album with trippy songs like &quot;Jesus Christ Pose,&quot; &quot;Searching with my Good Eye Closed,&quot; and &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide.&quot;  The album returns to rocking out in a big way though on track ten, the fast and insanely catchy &quot;Drawing Flies.&quot;  &quot;Holy Water&quot; features yet another grinding guitar riff with some more melodic vocals, while &quot;New Damage&quot; is a slower track with some cathartic wailing from Cornell.  All in all, &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot; showcases Soundgarden's versatility and musicianship with an interesting array of sounds.  It was these qualities which would serve the band so well on their next release.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is, quite simply, the best adaptation of a book that i have ever seen.  Though my children, at eighteen months and three, are too young for the books, I cannot wait to buy the video next month to watch with them.  The casting of the film was perfect, the characters every bit as lovable as in my imagination. The best thing I can say about this movie is that, after forcing my very reluctant husband, (who NEVER reads anything that doesn't feature a mountainbike on the cover) to watch the movie, he purchased and listened to the audio CDs for the remaining books in his car! This film is MAGIC, in more ways than one! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES.
B00005JKES|5.0|This is just an informal message to all of you guys who have not seen Twin Peaks before and don't know where to begin.<br />First of all I just want to say that Twin Peaks is the best thing to happen on this planet. It's just amazing from the very start.<br />Okay, now that's out of the way.<br />First you should buy/see the pilot episode. It's an import from Hong Kong or something, has a really bad sound and not-so-good picture, but it's the only version out there on DVD. I guess it's better than nothing. Oh...and it's REALLY expensive. <br />Then you should buy/see the \\"Twin Peaks - First season\\" box. It's not really the complete first season since the pilot episode (see above) is missing, but anyway... On this box is the rest of the first season (7 episodes). There's also some extras like interviews and that sort of things, but if you have never seen Twin Peaks before, do NOT - and I repeat - do NOT see these before you have seen the rest of the series. One guy in one of the interviews is actually saying who is the killer...so if you don't want to know that from a film professor, but rather from Twin Peaks itself, see the rest of the series first and the extras after that.<br />But now comes the problem: The second (and final) season does not exist on DVD yet. We all hope that some time in the near future this will be released, but for now you'll just have to wait for it. This season consist of 22 episodes. When this seasons is released, it will brobably contain some extras too, but I don't think you should see those either before seeing...<br />FIRE WALK WITH ME. That's the name of the Twin Peaks movie. It was released one year after the series final episode was shown on TV, but the story is about Twin Peaks's murder victim's life before she was murdered (one week before the pilot episode). Since it was released after the series, you should see it after you have seen the series. Another reason is that 1) You won't understand a single line if you haven't seen theseries first and 2) You will know about an hour in the movie who the killer is and that's not good!<br />Finally, there's a \\"european theatrical release version\\" of the pilot out there (only on VHS). This is the pilot episode with an alternative ending. Just for the über-fans of the show, but if you want to see <everything>, you should see this after you have seen everything else (see above). It was actually released on VHS before the series aired on TV, but it totally ruins the experience you'll get from the series because here too, you'll learn who the killer is.<br />So that's it. You can (if you're not up to date) order the whole series (not the pilot, though) on VHS, but I would have waited until the second season in released on DVD.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I wasn't crazy about Hey Baby when it hit the radio, but once I heard Hella Good, I wanted to buy the CD. I think Hella Good is a great song and is reminicient of the No Doubt of the 90s. I've always loved their ska base and punk feel. But this album is nothing like that. I hate to say this, but it's awful. The only song I like on Rock Steady is still Hella Good, which is the only reason I gave this album two stars. The rest of the songs are these cheesy lyrics and reggae beats that aren't even fun to listen to -- it's just painful.

B00005RY7X|4.0|God it's good to hear the noise Andrew W K is belching on this CD.  Detroit does it again!<BR>The sound is best described as Stooges meets the Ramones mixed with the Sweet.  Meaning it's savage, rocks hard and fast with a sense of humor and it's got a hook.  Jeez this is a STOOPID CD, but it's fun to listen to, and kicks arse while listening LOUD in the car!  This is a must for Hard Rock/Punk/Rock & Roll Lovers!  Guitars, Screaming Rock & Roll!
0767903862|4.0|Whether you plan a visit to Australia or not, this book is simply a fun read any way you look at it.  Bryson's descriptions tend to be off-the-cuff rather than stylized and professional, making his experiences much more real to the reader than the average travel book.  His descriptions are fascinating.  Before reading this book, Australia never had any particular interest for me.  Now I can't wait to go.
B000060MWU|1.0|I bought this DVD without noticing it wasn't widescreen because the store sticker was on top of the info. I was pretty mad when I got home and realized this. Then I sat down to watch it. I got hysterical. This is the worst DVD I have ever seen!!!! The compression looks like a bad internet stream, there's a faint white line that flashes randomly across the picture (like a ghost image), the sound is ordinary at best. I don't know who did this hack job but I certainly intend to find out and complain. I'm sure a high school kid with an iMac would've done a  better job at compressing this movie. It honestly looks like a copy of a copy of a pirated copy!<br />David Lynch is one of my favorite directors and I just can't believe he approved this. If you need a Lynch fix, get Blue Velvet and wait for a \\"real\\" version of Lost Highway. This edition is absolute trash.

B00003CXQX|5.0|Okay, I have to admit that sometimes I judge animated disney films by the looks of the characters; like I did with &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot;. I didn't even plan on watching this. But, my uncle had the DVD, so I decided to give it at least a try. It was one of the greatest Disney films ever! The plot wasn't boring at all, like I thought it would be. The characters were really entertaining. Especially Yzma's dumb sidekick, Kronk. This film was so touching. You know, Koozko risking his chance to become a human once again just to save Pacha from falling. This film ended with a great song that had a touching message. <br />I even cried a little at the end of this film. :)
B000059XUO|5.0|This DVD has it all, and is well worth the extra price. First of all there is a great movie. The Crow is a cult classic, but I don't mean to demean it at all by calling it one. Based on the comic book of the same name, The Crow has a great premise (a man comes back from the dead to avenge the death of the woman he loves) and is made well. It's a dark film made in muted, dark colors, almost black and white. The action sequences are great (after all, Brandon Lee is Bruce Lee's son). This would have been Brandon's break-out role if he hadn't died. It also has one of my favorite fight scenes, the shoot out at Top Dollar's. And Ernie Hudson is surprisingly good in his role in the film. And a great soundtrack. <br />The DVD is loaded with extras. There is commentary by Jeff Most (producer and executive music producer of the Crow movies) and John Shirley (co-writer of The Crow). Their commentary is almost as good as the film. You get a lot of insight into the movie, how it was made, and why certain choices were made. This is what DVD commentaries should be like. (It is a shame that Brandon Lee was unable to do a commentary, it would have been very interesting to see what he had to say about the film). Most's commentary is very informative and very entertaining. My only fault with the commentary is that there wasn't much on Brandon's death. I really expected to hear more about it, since it is such a huge part of the mythos of the film. Also on disc one is the DVD-ROM extras. There is the script that you read the same time the film is playing. There is a trivia game (which really isn't that great and is about the entire Crow franchise and not just this movie). You can also watch the \\"enhanced playback track\\" which has trivia and other features as the film plays. <br />In addition to the usual production stills, posters, and (five) story boards (one of those is the story board for the Shoot Out at Top Dollar's and it is very interesting to see), Disc 2 contains a Behind the Scenes featurette that runs about 15 minutes. It is not a making of, rather those involved with the movie (including Brandon Lee) discuss the movie and concept. There is a 30 minute Portrait of James O'Barr (creator of The Crow comic book) which is O'Barr in his basement talking to someone holding a video camcorder. You get a lot of insight into his life, his work, the movie, Hollywood, and where many of his ideas for The Crow came from.  There is something called the Deleted Footage Montage, but it really isn't deleted footage. There is some deleted footage in the montage, but most of it is outtakes, alternate takes, behind the scenes footage, and what looks like scenes that weren't deleted from the movie. It's a touching `tribute' to Brandon Lee, but not what it should have been. And finally there are three extended scenes (The Arcade Bombing; Fun Boy Fight; Shoot Out at Top Dollar's). What makes these so interesting is that you see what the original footage was and how they edited the scene to make it move so fast paced. You see the decision process in removing unessential footage to keep the movie from bogging down. <br />So you have a great movie and some really good extras on this DVD. Definitely one that should be in your library.
0790749858|5.0|I can't remember why I bought this movie in the first place, I think it was an impulse purchase a few years ago in the hopes that it would entertain my 4 year old.  Years later we still have the movie and now I want to get it on DVD for my other toddler.  I am no Warner Brothers fan nor a Michael Jordan fan, but I thought this movie was great and my little girl still likes to watch it.  She would pick this film over Cinderella any day.  If you are into super analyzing a film, comparing it to other Looney Tunes and expecting Shakespeare out of the actors, then yes, you will always find something to complain about. As for those who would prefer to watch Cartoon Network over this, then consider that when reading how they rated this movie.  This is way beyond and above what Cartoon Network would offer.  If you can just sit back and enjoy a film for what it is, then you will like this, I don't see how anyone can not find it amusing, albeit it does have a slightly offbeat sense of humor to it.  The addition of Bill Murray was the best part, his deadpan acting and view of reality provides the most laughs.  The songs are great, we HAD to get the soundtrack to it also. This is one movie that will stay in my collection, and it is certainly not just for little kids.  WATCH IT!!
0971855110|5.0|I have been FLYing since February, and bought this book as soon as it came out. The system is amazing! My life has honestly changed for the better thanks to the FLYLady, as my husband and friends can attest to. Her no-whining, no-excuses method is just the kick-in-the-rear that I and many like myself have needed. The book is great because it puts all of her system at your fingertips, for exploration at your leisure. The testimonials throughout the book are inspiring and affirming. You will never need another housecleaning book again!
B000002HJD|5.0|I am 33 years old and have listened to American Prayer at least a couple hundred times over the past 15 years. After reading some of the negative reviews, I am once again reminded of what separates the wheat from the chaff, in terms of people. This album is a perfect compilation of music and poetry (for lack of a different label). First off, anyone who is offended by the &quot;vulgarity&quot; of the album wouldn't strike me as someone who would appreciate Jim anyway. Other negative reviews seem to focus on 2-dimensional, establishment, criteria for good &quot;poetry&quot;. No, Jim doesn't focus on specific rhyme or syllabic patterns. The focus is on the words and the images they invoke. The shallowness of preoccupation with such trivial elements of poetry is troublesome to me. If you are one of these 2-dimensional folks who has all of life's answers figured out: where we came from, where we're going, etc., you do well to leave this album alone. All of Jim's work(especially on this album) deals with the uncertainty surrounding death/the &quot;loss of god&quot;. This underlying theme permeates much of what Jim is about. Also, in Jim's own words, the poetry on this album does exactly what it's suppose to - &quot;It's not suppose to say anything, just tick off the possibilities.&quot; I have found my brain ticking off the possibilities for the last 15 years on this one. In short, if you generally wake up in a good mood each morning, this Cd is not for you. If you often find yourself wondering what the heck's going on, you'll appreciate this CD.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is one of the classic Hitchcock films, made in the latter part of his career, where he could almost do no wrong. It ranks up there with Psycho, The Birds, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and in my opinion the only movie of Hitch's that is better than Rear Window is North By Northwest. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly give one of their better performances. The action in this movie takes place in Stewart's apartment or viewed from his apartment. Stewart plays a photographer who has broken his leg and is pretty much immobile (the cast is from the pelvis to foot) and witnesses what he suspects to be a murder. The film can be truly horrifying. Imagine what it would be like to watch a man attack the woman you love (there is only one way a man should be allowed to put his hands on Grace Kelly) from your window and not being able to do anything about it. Or having a hulking man (the size of Raymond Burr) coming to kill you and not being able to flee or adequately defend yourself. It gives a level of creepiness that you won't find outside of Psycho or The Birds. Rear Window is one of Hitch's more chilling works. <br />The DVD gives a better picture and sound quality over VHS and it is nice to be able to skip around the movie quickly. Unfortunately there is no commentary, but with Hitch dead and virtually no action who would be the logical choice? Probably better that no one attempts a commentary. In addition to trailers and production stills there are production notes, which give you that little bit of trivia that you can use to impress your friends with. There is also a featurette \\"conversation with screenwriter John Michael Hayes\\" which is interesting. And an hour long documentary titled \\"Rear Window Ethics\\" which is a commentary on the film (including audio interview excerpts with Hitchcock) and Restoring the Film. The two added featurettes are a definite plus for the DVD. Also, if you have a DVD-ROM on your computer you can get to a copyof the screenplay, which plays the section of the movie (in a little box in the corner) that you are reading. Makes for a nice addition to your DVD collection.
B000002UZ1|4.0|Here is the second of the 2 sets of double albums that were released containing some of the Beatles greatest hits and is nicknamed the Blue album.  The songs contained on both of these sets are pretty decent intros (though some of my favorites are missing), but the packages are rather expensive.  The cost would be justified if the CD's were close to being filled up, but they are not.  Instead, they were given the same track list as the original albums which came out in the 70s, hence they make poor use to the space available on a CD.  If you want to buy both, you are looking at spending a lot of money, that would be perhaps better sent on buying some of  the actual albums.  For those who just want to get a quick intro and see if they like it, The Beatles 1 disc might serve you better, though it is not as complete as these two sets, it is a much cheaper intro and uses the space much more efficiently. <br />Still for some, this disc might make sense.  It's positive points are: for those who own all the albums but don't have a CD burner to make their own best of CD collection (NOT illegal if you OWN all of the albums on which you are getting the songs from), this could be the best alternative.  Also the songs are remastered.  And if you just want to get a best of collection but are not interested enough to buy all the albums, then this set could be worth while.  <br />The booklet include are nice, having all the song lyrics plus nice photos.<br />Also, on the Blue Album, the version of A Day in The Life does not have the Sgt Pepper Reprise fadeout when the song starts, which as far as I know is the only way to get this version.
B00005JKJA|1.0|I believe David Lynch is one of the boldest an most creative directors in american cinema. But if you want to catch 2 examples of this brilliance buy the Elephant man or Blue velvet,not this hogwash of an unbalanced movie!!! This film never really takes off the ground an remains lackluster through out. I love Lynch's Past efforts but not this one. This film made me feel plenty of Garmonbozia(pain an sorrow)...
B00005JKES|5.0|This superb box set collection has brought Twin Peaks back into my life at last!<br />I already had the pilot (which is NOT and never was part of the first series!!!) on DVD so eagerily anticipated the release of series one.<br />Some reviewers here need to think a little before slagging off this box set.  The pilot is NOT part of the first series!!!  HOw many other TV shows include the one off pilot episode in a series one collection?<br />Also, another reviewer has hand picked a lack of characters from series TWO in their review of this!!  All very bizarre.<br />This set is not available in the UK, so I was delighted when it came up from grabs on Amazon.com<br />Does anyone know the timescale for series two being released?<br />Guess what, that will not include the pilot episode either, shock horror!!<br />Buy, sit back and enjoy the best TV ever made.
B00003CY6M|3.0|\\"Serendipity\\" is that kind of romantic comedy you know for sure how it is going to end since the very first scene. Jonathan and Sara meet in a department store a few days before christmas. Both are engaged and believed they would stay together if that was their destiny. So, Jonathan writes his phone number on a $5 dollar bill and sarah hers on an old book she sells. If these objects came back to them unexpectedly, they were meant to be a couple.<br />The soundtrack is good and you can see lots of NY sights in this movie. As always, John Cusak is great.I liked the movie, but I was a little disapointed with it, because it is too predictable. It's not boring, but entertaining, due to the coincidences uniting the main characters. The extra material could be better, with cast interviews and other making off stuffs.<br />Despite my comments, I recommend you watch this movie in a sunday afternoon, just for fun.
0380973650|4.0|This is another one of those cases where I'd like to give 4 1/2 stars; since I can't I've decided to err on the side of caution rather than exuberance, and award 4 stars to this great work of modern fantasy, which is almost -- but not quite -- perfect.<br />American Gods is a reinterpretation of the numerous myths and myth-figures of the Old World -- the Norse, African, Asian, Greek, and Egyptian pantheons, the pagan gods and faery-folk of the Celts and Picts, Nativa American spirit animials, and others.  Enough gods to fill a plenitude of Heavens...and Hells. The novel takes these beings and places them in an American context (hence the title!) -- the first of many juxtapositions which make the story as brilliant as it is...but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br />The actual tale centers on Shadow, a small-time ex-con of uncertain origin and less certain future, whose beloved wife perishes just as he is paroled. Drifting and heartbroken, he falls in with Mr. Wednesday, who hires Shadow to drive his car...and to do things much less beneficial for someone who's on parole. Wednesday, we soon learn, is none other than Odin, the Norse god, who is trying to organize all the Old World deities for a final, apocalyptic (what else?) battle against the gods of the New World: Television, Internet, and even undercover operatives of a shadowy Secret Agency straight out of The X-Files. It's this fight which is central to the novel...or is it? The more Shadow becomes involved with Wednesday's doings, the less certain he is of anything -- and by the time the novel reaches its stunning denouement, Shadow (and the reader) will understand that Wednesday's \\"holy war\\" isn't all it's cracked up to be. By then you will have been mightily entertained, amused, delighted, and horrified -- sometimes all at once -- by Gaiman's incredible tale.<br />That isn't hyperbole, either. Gaiman has written a superb novel here, superior in just about every way to 90% of the fantasy that's out there. Only Tim Powers, Blaylock, and possibly Terry Pratchett are doing better work...and if Gaiman keeps doing stuff like this, he may very well outstrip them all. American Gods is imaginative as hell, particularly in its depictions of the Old Gods who make up the central supporting cast. They aren't seen as gods, but as just another bunch of immigrants, working dead-end jobs and eking out a bare-bones existence, because their native and unique \\"skills\\" no longer serve them in America. So it is that they take whatever work they can -- waiting tables, pumping gas, even prostitution. A Russian god works for a Chicago slaughterhouse. Several of the Egyptian gods work in Cairo, Illinois (where else?) as undertakers -- such a brilliant concept, just thinking about it brings a smile to my face. There is also a leprchaun who makes an early appearance, and is a hilarious distillation of all the Irish myths which populate our collective consciousness -- the hard drinker, the bare-knuckles brawler, the quick-tempered, coarse-natured ruffian. Being of Irish descent myself, I found this particularly amusing, if only because it's at once so far from the truth, and so close to it. The guy might have stepped right off someone's Notre Dame jacket.<br />Another reason this book excels is because it works on so many different levels. On one level it is a mystery; on another it's dark fantasy; on yet another it retells one of the oldest myths, the god's death and rebirth, which crops up again and again in religions  the world over. Gaiman has done his homework here and then some, and it shows in the numerous myths and myth-figures which occupy this novel's background -- everything from urban myths, to tall tales, to local heroes, can be found here. Sometimes they are blazingly original and subtle, as in the case of the numerous \\"Home Of This Great Athlete\\" signs welcoming Shadow to practically every town he visits. Sometimes they're blazingly obvious; I figured out the deal with the \\"klunker\\" long before I think I was supposed to.<br />But that's one of the few flaws in a novel full of wonders and delights. Gaiman, a Briton by birth, writes American dialogue and characters with a facility that is scary. His prose is crisp, clean, and puts me in mind of Stephen King at his peak, imitating Harlan Ellison. Lines like \\"[He was] the same size and shape as a Coke machine\\" populate the pages, full of a descriptive wit which is rare in modern fiction. If you care about modern fantasy at all, then American Gods is for you. There are few novels in any field that I can reccommend more highly.g before I think I was supposed to. <br />But that's one of the few flaws in a novel full of wonders and delights.

0399143904|1.0|I am a big fan of Tom Clancy's earlier work.  But as Jon's review noted: much of this book must have been written by someone else, and written poorly.  Tom Clancy is the acknowledged master of military detail.  How could he refer to Clark's legendary Vietnam-era unit (SOG) by the wrong name (\\"Special Operations Group\\")?  Any armchair special ops fan knows the correct name (\\"Studies and Observations Group\\").  Likewise, the book wrongly refers to the MH-6/AH-6 helicopter as \\"the Nightstalker.\\"  In fact, \\"Night Stalkers\\" is the nickname for the pilots and crew of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (motto: \\"Night Stalkers Don't Quit\\") portrayed so vividly in \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"  The MH-6/AH-6 chopper is known as the \\"Little Bird.\\"  I think Tom Clancy knows these details -- it's too bad he didn't read the book that was published under his name.<br />The book also was never read by a copy editor.  Bits of dialogue between the same characters are repeated verbatim just a few paragraphs apart.  Popov states that Sean Grady is \\"quite ruthless,\\" and Henricksen agrees.  On the next page, Henricksen asks Popov if Grady \\"has a reputation for ruthlessness.\\"  Short term memory loss?  These simple, silly errors recurred too often to list.  Either Clancy's editors are too cowed to correct simple errors in his work, or he really is paid by the word (and refuses to cut obvious repetition in order to pad his word count).<br />Even if the reader is able to suspend disbelief and swallow the major premise, there are obvious holes in the bad guys' plot.  How did a fanatical tree-hugger become the CEO of a major corporation (or a Presidential advisor) without ever revealing at least some of his/her wacko beliefs?  Doesn't ring true.  How did the Project bring in at least 50 conspirators, without a single leak or compromise of security?  Efforts to maintain secrecy could have been an interesting part of the tale, but the issue is never mentioned.  Finally, after the Project was kept in secrecy for years, why was Popov sent to wander around the facilities unsupervised?  Makes no sense.  <br />It should be clear to Clancy fans that this book was commissioned as a set-up for the computer game of the same name.  I've heard the game is pretty good.  It's too bad the book is such a shoddy piece of work.  I'm going to try out the game myself -- all the shooting might help me work out some frustration from wasting my time reading Rainbow Six.
B00005RYKU|2.0|Well, if the movie will not disappoint you, I dont know what will...
0800196767|2.0|An 8-year old friend of mine has been asking me to watch this movie with her for several months, so I finally rented and watched it with her.  Based on the description on the back of the video case, I was prepared for the good versus bad scenario, but not for the truly abusive and outright hostile behavior on the part of Matilda's parents and the school principal.  The whole thing starts with the newborn Matilda being tossed in the back of the family SUV where she crashes from side to side in her unsecured child seat on the drive home from the hospital while her parents fight.  Things go from bad to worse as the parents leave her home alone from the age of 4, tear up her library books, become verbally abusive when she shows her intelligence, and neglect to send her to school until the age of 6.<br />When the parents finally get around to sending Matilida to school, it's to a place ruled by a woman who behaves like a demented drill sergeant, screaming abuse at the top of her lungs, picking kids up and throwing them out windows, and hurling darts at their pictures.  To punish children who break her rules, she locks them in closets studded with nails, humiliates them in front of other students and swings them in circles by their pigtails before tossing them over fences.  Sound a bit over the top?  It gets worse.<br />Equally disturbing is the pretty young school teacher who does nothing to protect her students despite the fact that she is all too familiar with the woman's behavior.  Her timidity is explained by the fact that the principal is her aunt who has been physically and psychologically abusing her for years. No one, not even the parents of the other 100 or so children at the school can manage to do anything either.  Has no one heard of the police or child protective services?  If you were a young child seeing an adult physically hurt and emotionally destroy children, how would you feel when not a single adult steps in to remedy the situation?<br />The solution posed by the movie is to have Matilda develop magical powers.  These powers are discovered when she finally becomes so upset by the abuse that her emotions activate them.  Here is another disturbing message.  Talents and special abilities are unleashed by violence and anger?  The only way out of abusive situations is through magic?<br />Finally, I had a hard time with the images of women in this movie.  Matilida's mother is portrayed as an airhead, her teacher as a thin, frail waif who can do nothing to protect herself or her students, and the principal (a former Olympic athlete who is very strong and still loves sports)as a child abuser.  What are the underlying messages being given here?  Women who are strong athletes become obsessed and use their strength to hurt others?  Thin, frail and timid women are ineffective until rescued by magic?  This all smacks of Cinderella and Snow White to me.<br />Whatever your interpretation of the role models, I would strongly suggest that you think twice before exposing your children to the violence in this film.  My 8-year old friend was in tears and didn't seem at all consoled by the sappy magical solution.  She wanted to know why nobody helped Matilda when she was little,  and why none of the parents of the students stopped the principal. I wanted to know what the point of all the cruelty was.  In my opinion this film was way out of line.n posed by the movie is to have Matilda develop magical powers.

B000001FS6|1.0|A very overrated album by a very overrated band. U2, with its incantatory vocals, its asthmatic guitar riffs and its sententious messages, has always been closer to church music than to rock n'roll. If you think this is rock, you must be either 15 or 85.
B00005RHGK|2.0|This is sheer enjoyment if you watch it with your brains in the \\"off\\" position. Even for the horror genre, there are actual plot holes as big as the hole where the Demon beast hide the bodies of its victims!!!!<BR>Other than this, theres no way for you not like the first half of the movie, where we are introduced to the brothers, the beast and a few of its preys. THen things get a little bit out of the hand with the history, bnut the overall result is a very satisfactory horror movie.
B000007R13|5.0|I had the quad LP in the 70's.  We listened to it because a lot of the 2 channel LP's seemed poorly pressed.  This DTS disc isn't perfect, but it is the best version you'll ever hear of this concert.  Imagine, Duane- left rear, Dickey-right rear, and the rhythm and vocals up front.  To me, the &quot;Fillmore concerts&quot; CD set was nice, but disappointing, in that many alternative recordings were used.  I preferred the original song selection.  This is worth owning (as is the Mobile Fidelity version, if you can find it.)
B00005RHGK|1.0|That is the worst - least scary - film I have ever seen.  Promising first 15 minutes followed by the least intelligent, pointless collection of disjointed scenes, lame acting and general nonsense I have ever come across.  Where was the tension, fear, scares?  None....
B00005YW4H|5.0|I heard &quot;Cold,Cold, Heart&quot; on internet radio and just loved it. Norah is very talented on piano and has a great sense of timing and phrasing. Her sound belies her age, I think she will be very popular in circles that appreciate this style of music, I sure do!
B00005JKBC|4.0|Great Movie, but I could not get the English sub-titles to go away on my Mitsubishi DD-6000 player. So I watched it on an old RCA DVD player, where the problem did not repeat itself. I suspect this is a defect on the DVD, since others are having the same issue.
B00005RY7X|5.0|This is the middle of the road CD that has so been lacking in the music world.Music has either been really negative and heavy, or its been so bubblegum you want to puke.This album does neither of those.This seems like the kind of stuff Judas Priest were putting out in 86,like TURBO,or If you remember the band Accept, this is like their album Metal Heart.It is exactly like Too High To Get It Right or Midnight Mover off that album.The real good heavy metal years ended about 84, then those same bands began to do much more commercial stuff-this sounds like that 85-86 stuff.It also mixes a little bit of more recent Green Day(circa WARNING).Musically it is terrible with very little talent.But ,the energy and feel good attitude make up for it.The past 15 years have been a really bad time for music, in that anything good didnt make it to radio,or completely bombed.You really have to dig to find good music.The radio is a complete wasteland, and will miss out on this album,as it misses out on everything that isnt backed with a fat check.When I first heard party, I thought this must be the exception on the CD, this guy sounds like he might be another RobZombie.The cover made me think this album must be typical I hate Life 90-2002 music.I was pleasantly surprised when I got the CD.It was very heavy,but seemed positive at the same time-a hard feat indeed.If you took away the distorted guitars, you'd really see how light this CD is.It seems a little naive, but naivety is sorely needed in this day and age.Everybody is so worried about coming off cheesy, that their music ends up being boring.Everybody is so worried about being a cliche, here's a guy who embraces cliches. This is rooted in Chuck Berry, while Rob Zombie is rooted in BAuhaus. Live every moment is the message on this album.Life is not about the seven demons of hell coming to get you, life is about partying with the seven demons of hell!!!
B00005JKL8|5.0|This is probably one of the best military action movies I have ever seen. I especially liked the opening of the movie. It struck me as a little odd as to why Serbian soldiers were planting trees to the backdrop of erie back tingling music. As most people are familiar with the atrocities that the Serbs committed during their reign of carnage and mayhem, then you probably guesed why the soldiers were planting trees.<br />Another aspect of the movie that I liked was the portrayal of the immense difficulties that existed between American and Allied NATO forces in how operations were to be carried out against the Serbs. However, I believe that more information could have been given about the relationship between the French and American Admiral.<br />Although the ending was predictable and somewhat gungho, I feel it was a proper ending. When Hackman joined the Marine team in it's extraction of the downed navigator, it really displayed the humanness of the American Admiral.<br />This movie is a must because it reminds us of the carnage that ensues unleashed terror.
B00003CXI1|5.0|As a big fan of the Harry Potter series, I was anxious to see the movie.  Now I'm dying to see the next one!  Fun for the whole family, over and over again!
B00005QZWI|5.0|The music managed to catch the feelings of the movie and  the book perfectly.  The Hobbit's theme makes you feel as if you are contently skipping through the feilds of the Shier, while the Uri-ki (SP?) theme makes you think of fire and hammers, and the \\"Evil theme\\" is just plain scary! And the Fellowship theme is perhaps on of the best peices of music I've ever heard. And Enya is, of coares, fantastic
B00005O5JV|5.0|Reese Witherspoon (Pleasantville) has done an excellent job of taking a potential fluff/dumb blonde film and turning it into an edearing story of going after a dream not just for a man but for herself.  I have never loved a comedy like I have loved this one...only My Man Godfrey comes close to it.  Went to see this with friends, thinking it was just a dumb blonde flick and was very pleasantly surprised to find this cheerleader [turned] sorority queen dealing seriously with her own decision to go on to Harvard Law School.  Whoever played her beau was a brilliant foil.  The wit is marvelous and absolutely charming.  I have watched this film many times, and enjoyed it more with each watching.  Don't be turned off by the title....do take a chance; it's worth it!
B00005V9HH|5.0|For a movie that wasn't a mega-success when it was released in theatres, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; finally gets a good deluxe treatment.  Beisdes getting to pick between seeing it in pan and scan or widescreen, you also get two commentaries from the creators of this cool crime thriller.  Plus, it was great to see the documentaries on this film (and also learning that the famous interrogation scene wasn't intentionally meant to be as funny as it was), and some of the hidden material on this DVD.  But the prime reason for getting this is the movie itself.  Boasting one of the better ensembles in the realm of current crime dramas, this movie manages to succeed at being one of the more surprising movies the 1990's ever produced.
0790749815|4.0|&quot;North by Northwest&quot; has been hailed as one of director Alfred Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces. In terms of script, acting and intrigue, that is absolutely true. &quot;North by Northwest&quot; can be enjoyed for the same reasons as virtually ever other Hitchcock film, particularly because they keep the viewer guessing until the very end.<br />However, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; adds another dimension for your viewing interest. It is perhaps the worst-edited movie of its quality that I've ever seen. There are hanging boom mikes, reflections in mirrors, and visible scenery curtains. Two things to particularly look for: the missing roof on Cary Grant's cab near the beginning of the film, and a little boy with his hands on his ears BEFORE Eva Marie Saint even produces her pistol in the Mount Rushmore cafeteria. The missing roof might not be visible in some prints, especially those which have been modified for TV screens, but the boy is evident in every version and is always a howl for those who know he's there.<br />Even with the errors, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; is a wonderful movie, and is something worth owning -- particularly on widescreen DVD, so you can freeze, and even magnify, the mistakes!
1577314808|5.0|One of the more notable spiritual teachers to emerge over the last couple of decades is German-born Eckhart Tolle, whose book \\"The Power Of Now\\" has proved to be an absolutely phenomenal success. This book caught on not only among seasoned spiritual seekers, but also penetrated into the mainstream of Western culture, and once Oprah Winfrey started to recommend it, iconic status was guaranteed. It is well deserved though, because the quality of \\"The Power of Now\\" is beyond any kind of dispute.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle's path to his present role as a major spiritual teacher in the Western world is quite unique in that prior to his spiritual awakening he didn't study with any teacher and didn't observe any particular spiritual practice. He reports in the introduction to \\"The Power of Now\\" to have lived in an almost constant state of anxiety, despair and depression until shortly after his 29th birthday. Then one night his inner pain became so unbearable that consciousness withdrew from its identification with the mind, which led to a spontaneous and profound spiritual awakening. He spent the following years integrating and understanding this new dimension of consciousness, and it took some 20 years from his initial awakening until he wrote \\"The Power of Now\\", during which time he also studied the work of other spiritual teachers and traditions.<br /><br />The teaching outlined in \\"The Power of Now\\" is firmly rooted in a non-dual tradition with clear parallels to Buddhist philosophy, and yet it expresses a truly unique and radical approach to spirituality. It is a profound and far-reaching work, but at the same time it is so easy to understand that anyone can read it and relate to its contents. It is precisely this rare quality of expressing deep, timeless truth in a straightforward and simple manner that is one of this book's greatest strengths. The format that Eckhart Tolle chose for \\"The Power of Now\\" is one of questions and answers, which contributes greatly to making this book so accessible. He says in the introduction that the book is based on answers to questions from people at retreats and in private sessions, which goes some way to explain the freshness and immediacy of the text.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle's teaching bears some resemblance to that of the late J. Krishnamurti, but unlike Krishnamurti, he does prescribe certain practices for living what he calls the liberated life. One example of this what he has to say about body awareness. He claims that by being attentive to the energy field of the physical body, it is much easier to go beyond thought and live effortlessly in the present moment. However, he stresses that this isn't something to be practised with an eye to future results. On the contrary, the experience of consciously inhabiting the body is part of enlightenment, and anyone can do it, without any special training or background in spiritual matters.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle seems to imply that enlightenment is already the case, and that we only need to stop and be silent for this dimension to be revealed to us. Furthermore, he maintains that enlightenment is the only truly natural way to live one's life, and that it is only through a radical transformation of human consciousness that humanity can ever hope to live in peace and harmony.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Now\\" is a book of extraordinary clarity, understanding and beauty. During the relatively few years that have passed since it was first published, it has earned a highly deserved place among the classic and timeless expressions of human spirituality. Like his two other main books, [[ASIN:0340829745 Stillness Speaks: Whispers of Now]] and [[ASIN:0141039418 A New Earth: Create a Better Life]], it is likely to inspire and challenge spiritual seekers for many years to come.ower of Now is a book of extraordinary clarity, understanding and beauty.

B00005OWEH|5.0|\\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" is quite possible my favorite war movie.  The acting is superb, mainly Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall.  Based on a story called \\"The Heart of Darkness,\\" the movie is about a Captain in the Vietnam War who is introduced in a very bad state.  He's not in the jungle fighting, but he wants to be there, he misses it, and he sort of starts to break down.  Then, he finally gets what he is hoping for: a mission.  His mission is to go upriver into Cambodia, which is known as being particularly \\"hairy,\\" and there he must hunt down a military colonel gone mad.  The colonel assassinated people that he believed were double agents, and then disappeared into Cambodia.  The young Captain, played exceptionally well by Martin Sheen, must hunt him down and terminate the colonel \\"with extreme prejudice.\\"  Along the way, he meets up with the crew of the boat that is taking him upriver, and also meets a very interesting Robert Duvall, who is a military officer that orders some men to fight, and others to surf.  There are many other things that happen in the 3 hour and 22-minute-long movie.  \\"Apocalypse Now\\" shows how horrible war really is, and gets to be rather intense.  It is the darkest war movie that I've seen, and I definitely recommend it if you like a well-made war movie.
0060922583|5.0|This book is an absolute must read for anyone interested in &quot;paranormal&quot; phenomena. Thought provoking in the extreme and highly credible, this book makes quantum physics understandable to the lay person. It lets us know that &quot;reality &quot; is only so real. By bringing together numerous sources documenting the existence of paranormal phenomena, he lets us know that these phenomena are too prevalent to be rationally dismissed as they so often are by society at-large.<br />Unlike many people who are drawn to books describing paranormal phenomena, Talbot had direct knowledge and experience with paranormal phenomena. These expereinces coupled with his superb powers of discernment allowed him to give us a brilliant overview of things &quot;paranormal&quot; and to place these phenomena into a scientific context. He successfully bridged the two worlds. I commend him for pulling of a stupendous feat. He has made a real contribution.<br />Also recommended: 1) Reinventing Medicine (Larry Dossey), 2) The Fire From Within (Carlos Castaneda), 3) The Path (Esmeralda Arana), 4) Far Journeys (Robert Monroe).
