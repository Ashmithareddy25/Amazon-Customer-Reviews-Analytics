B0013D8LOU|4.0|For me, I always feel Edward Scissorhands is Tim Burton's best film while a Nightmare Before Christmas is the best one he was attached to. But he's one of those kind of filmmakers that tends to flipflop between projects that show what he's capable of to films that are more or less visual eye-candy and little else. For every Big Fish there's a Planet of the Apes or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. His latest, Sweeney Todd, can very much be described as his best since Big Fish and while it's not for everyone, it's certainly showing a director who can deliver on the goods anytime he can.    Benjamin Barker became the victim of Judge Turpin and sentenced away from London leaving Turpin with Barker's wife Lucy and daughter. 15 years later, now renamed himself Sweeney Todd and mind on revenge, he decides to go after Turpin with the help of Mrs. Lovett, a pie-owner known for \\"the worst pies in London\\". With Anthony the sailor in love with Todd's daughter Johanna, Todd goes after those who did him wrong but starting something can take you farther than you planned.    Strangely, the only musicals that I can really stand are those from Disney. I love the songs and lyrics and don't find them distracting from the overall film but in live-action, there's that weird part of you that finds it odd characters would not only burst out in song during conversation but inexplicably, people around them will know the tempo, timing and the lyrics to join in. But with the theatricality of the story and the Broadway origins, I can forget it. The music, huge in bombast though some could find it ever-shifting and almost sloppy, helps bring out the story and adds to it rather than just being \\"song time\\". The 2 main actors don't have the most cleanest vocals but they're serviceable within the film.    Burton's style, like David Fincher, is incredibly unique and it's easy to point out what he had a hand in and Sweeney Todd is almost an even drearier Sleepy Hollow...if that's possible. A greyishtint and low lighting is abundant in Sweeney Todd and while not the most shiniest film to test out your new system, it's quite attractive in its weird macabre way. The acting is quite spot-on as frequent Burton colloborator Johnny Depp goes for broke and probably gives his most twisted performance and there's even times where he's almost frightening. Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall and even Sasha Baron Cohen do good work though my one gripe is Helena Bonham Carter who's not as humorous as a role of hers kind of needed nor can she sing all that well (\\"Worst Pies in London\\" kind of...hurts sometimes).     With a musical genre, a dreary look and frequent gore spots, including a doozy with a stove, if you can handle it, Sweeney Todd is definately worth a look.
0887307280|5.0|THE E_MYTH REVISITED is worth reading and revisiting. Gerber reminds the reader about the basic premise of business: satisfying the customer, in a new, entertaining, and insightful way.<br /><br />He proposes that the three key characteristics (skills) of a successful business owner are: skilled technician, entrepeneur, and manager. This is sound advise and a proper balance of the three prevents tyranny by any one personality. I have seen exagerations of all three of these skill sets to the ruin of the afflicted enterprises; mine included.<br /><br />As a case study, he follows Sarah, owner of All About Pies, as he leads her through her catharsis from exhausted technician to balanced, productive and fulfilled business owner.<br /><br />There is a great deal of truth that Gerber captures and teaches along with room for some disagreement. Not every business, for example, is suited to be franchised. Not every service can easily be documented. Nonetheless, this quick read is worth its weight in gold to the young or new businessman. I wish I had read this 20 years ago - it would probably have changed my business and my life.
B000244FDW|4.0|This adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is the 1980 BBC miniseries,adapted by British novelist Fay Weldon and is a very faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. It consists of five episodes and stars the engaging Elizabeth Garvie as Ms Elizabeth Bennet and the aristocratic-looking and handsome David Rintoul as Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy.<br /><br />This was the first adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that I watched, almost 16 years ago back when I was in college, and till today it remains one of my favorite adaptations of Austen's works, right up there with the 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. In fact, both Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul do a very credible job portraying the lead roles.<br /><br />Although Jennifer Ehle was charming and feisty in her role in the 1995 version, Elizabeth Garvie makes a spirited Elizabeth and a very attractive, bright woman. She delivers her lines with great spirit and I was utterly charmed by her performance. Her chemistry with Mr Darcy was also very believable, from the early days of misunderstanding and tension to the gradual growing of affection between them. David Rintoul's Darcy may not be as popular as Colin Firth's but he definitely brings a certain dignity and charm of his own to the role.<br /><br />As for the adaptation of the novel itself, the 1980 version is more faithful than the 1995 version, as it also contains about 75 extra minutes of dialogue that adds to the authentic feel of the adaptation. The rest of the casting in the 1980 adaptation was also well-done - Priscilla Morgan is hilarious as Mrs Bennet,Moray Watson is wonderful as the beleaguered Mr Bennet,Sabina Franklyn as the very beautiful and very nice Jane Bennet,Marsha Fitzalan made a very conniving Caroline Bingley and Judy Parfitt is perfect as the haughty and meddlesome Lady Catherine de Bourgh. However, I must admit that I preferred the 1995 casting with respect to the roles of Mr Collins [suitably oily and deferential], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.<br /><br />What lets down this older adaptation is the poor production quality - the lighting is too dull and scenes of dancing at the balls are very uninspired with cheap looking, very small sets that don't enhance the dramatisation. It's a pity for with better production values, this could have been a stellar production given that it had a great screenplay and wonderful acting.<br /><br />On the whole, I find it hard to fault this adaptation. It will always remain one of my favorite adaptations, not just of Pride and Prejudice, but of Austen's works as it is very faithful and well-cast. I recommend this to all Janeites and also those who have only watched the 1995 adaptation and the movie version starring Keira Knightley.and deferential], Lydia Bennet and Mr Wickham.

B00082IJ08|4.0|I bought the album for only a few songs, but found that the songs were much better than I expected. It also has a good range of different genres all in one album. For the most part, it was very enjoyable, only a couple of songs were a bit grating.
B000E6GBV2|4.0|is an apt synopsis of this album. Not breaking major new ground, but somehow managing to create a classic sound, Band of Horses sounds like Brian Wilson's slightly melancholy, introspective brother who also likes Ride; creating sing-a-long-y sad pop gems infulenced by roots rock, alt-country, and dare i say it, gloom-pop. Somehow they make this sound important and meaningful and it's hard not to like the swirling melodies of \\"Wicked Gil\\" or the intimate, disarming folk of \\"St. Augustine\\". Sublime Anglo pop for today.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|King has said he wrote the story as an homage to Lovecraft, and if your read his novella, it's rife with Lovecraftian references. To this end, Darabont did the story a greater justice with his decidedly Lovecraftian ending. In Lovecraftian literature (Cthulhu Mythos, et al), the stories are all about the futility of hope, insanity derived from seeing the horrific or beautiful \\"beyond the measure a human might perceive\\", and the good guys never winning in the end. Had HP written \\"The Mist,\\" he assuredly would have chosen the same ending as Darabont. Darabont did an amazing job making this film very-HP Lovecraft, from tentacles-action (also in the original King story), to truly cyclopean creatures that literally seemed to have walked off a Lovecraft story. Viewing the film as Lovecraftian, then, Darabont's ending completely fits with the rest of the story, and is the only way it could have ended. I'd love to know how SK felt when he saw it. As an aside, I doubt American audiences would have liked the original King ending either, where the protagonists simply drive away hoping to find an end to the Mist...
B00133MKVK|2.0|Maybe it's just me feeling my age, but I was sadly disappointed with Shirley Bassey's new release, \\"Get The Party Started\\".  Usually I'm so moved by her voice,I'd pay to hear her sing anything or so I thought.  While her voice still seems as incredibly strong as ever, it's the material she's singing and the arrangements that make you feel that there's just something missing. I SO wanted and expected to love this CD. Instead, sadly,I feel it's a waste of this brilliant performers talent.

1594489505|4.0|I am fascinated by books like this one and Reading Lolita in Tehran. While the books are set in different countries and social classes, they both present a culture that is unfamiliar and in some ways indecipherable to me. I constantly wonder if my perceptions of the characters (as weak/strong/willful/shy/etc.) are indeed about their personalities ... or arethe people that way just because that is the way someone of their status is supposed to behave in that environment?    Hosseini's book offers interwoven personal stories and pressures that survive in an unchangeable and yet precarious world. In this world, so much of life is written in stone that any diversion from the expected is astonishing and even unbelievable. I ask myself, do I know more know than I did before I read the book?

B000ILZ67S|3.0|Alex is a fourteen year old boy who has to go through many difficult events.  I, as an adult, enjoyed the book; however, I do not believe that it is appropriate reading for those under 15 years.  Within the first paragraph it talks about a man being killed, the words Kill/Killing are used four times within the first chapter, not to mention a detailed description of a death scene.  In chapter 4, poor Alex is being tortured and the torturers are threatening to cut off his finger.  This seems a bit violent for younger readers.  It is action filled with lots of violence and blood, definitely a fast and enjoyable read for those who like such books.  BEWARE parents as this series is being advertised to 4th grade and lower children.
B000P12LWY|5.0|This was an excellent first season series and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br />There are many different historical versions about the Reign of Henry VIII, Catherine and Ann Boleyn. None of the story ever gets old, and all the plot twists and turns seem refreshed in this continuing series.<br />I do wish there had been a little more about Henry's older brother, Arthur and what led up to Henry marrying Arthur's bride after His death, and ascending to the throne....but I guess every story has to start somewhere.<br /> All in all a very entertaining way to spend the hours!

B0007PAMR4|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS GREAT. NOTE: IT IS LONG, SO YOU NEED A LITTLE PATIENCE. THE ACTING IS THE BEST. GREAT PLOT. GREAT COSTUMES ETC.... IT DOES HAVE SOME GREAT COMBAT AND ACTION SCENES AND SOME GREAT SUSPENSE. THE STORY IS LONG. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BUNCH OF BLOOD AND GUTS, THIS IS PROBABLY TOO INTELLECTUALLY COMPLICATED FOR YOUR TASTES. THE FIRST TIME I WATCHED IT, I THOUGHT IT WAS OK. I WATCHED IT A SECOND TIME THE VERY NEXT DAY. I LOVED IT. WHY, I UNDERSTOOD THE PLOT AND DETAILS DURING THE 2ND VIEWING.
B0013D8LOU|2.0|Musicals are a highly personal preference. I don't begrudge people who liked this movie. I just wasn't one of them. Personally, I found the music un-melodious, and the lyrics insufficiently poetic. Perhaps Sweeny Todd is an acquired taste. Perhaps if I watched it a few times, I'd like it more. But for me, the musicals I enjoy most are the ones that I love the first time around. For your derision :-) I will list my favorite musicals: \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\", \\"Music Man\\", \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Fiddler on the Roof\\", and the delightful \\"A Shoggoth on the Roof\\" (which, so far as I know, only ever made it to audio form, from the HP Lovecraft Historical Society, and you kinda need to know about the Cthulhu Mythos to fully get it, but it's great). The trick with each one of these is that the very first time I watched them, I found the music beautiful. I listen to a lot of rock and metal, and it often strikes me as odd that a lot of my favorite songs took a couple of listens before I really loved them. But musical writers really don't have that luxury. They pretty much get one shot to make you love their stuff. And if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen. For me, it just didn't happen this time. Having said this, I thought Depp brought terrific pathos to his role. I regret giving this movie a mere two stars, simply because I don't think it gives enough credit to his role. (But see some of the 1-star reviews where people are angry at his singing! Personally, I thought it was quite good for someone who isn't a professional singer).
B000UBMWG4|5.0|After buying the standard definition 5-disc version, i was impressed with the content but now with this Blu-Ray version it's a whole new ballpark.  The picture quality is outstanding considering the age of the movie, there is so much more to see and hear. You're missing out if you don't have this in your collection.  Nice one Ridley.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|Mike Oldfield was originally going to call his first album \\"Opus 1\\", rather than \\"Tubular Bells\\".  \\"Music of the Spheres\\" is Oldfield's true Opus 1.  He has created a wonderful classical piece.    When I heard that Oldfield had gone classical, I was concerned that he created something totally experimental and far afield from his previous works that I enjoy so much.  I was pleased he chose to start with the next evolution of \\"Tubular Bells\\" and then take off from there.    It all works for me.  I'm so glad Mike Oldfield's creativity is alive and well.

B000A7DVR2|3.0|This movie is great! Without a doubt, but I purchased this \\"3\\" times, and the same thing happened: the cover says widescreen edition and the disc is fullscreen (except for the new intro). Should I try the fullscreen and hope that the disc is wide? Not worth my time!
B0012F9VS4|5.0|I bought this book for my six year old nephew who is going to get a baby sister in May 2008.  I read the book when it arrived at my house.  I loved it...it was simple to read and the pictures where nice too.  I'd suggest this book for others looking for this type of book.
B00005OM4K|5.0|Although I like to have all the seperate albums the same as the vinyl ones I ordered this box for a price worth it. What's making it really worth is that you have all the recordings from CCR (even the live-ones) and pre-CCR at once in a very high (remastered) quality. Listen how good John Fogerty (and his bandmembers) really were at that time and still is after all those years!
0307387178|4.0|but great anyway.  I saw the movie first and I didnt know anything about Alex's story, so it was a good surprise. the writer shares his how experiences and shows Alex's story as viewed by all sorts of people.  Its a good book that went on to make an amazing movie.
0670036544|4.0|The Whole Story's edition of The Hound of the Baskervilles is an excellent way to read the novel without first being familiar with Victorian English society.  The original text of the novel is reprinted in full, without annotative numbers or footnotes to distract from the story.  All historical pictures, anecdotes, and information are to be found in the margins, complete with smaller, bold text.  This allows the reader to read the original novel without interruption, read the novel while glancing to the margins for additional historical tidbits, or just peruse the history separately.<br /><br />The pictures and anecdotes are simply presented, interesting, and relevant to the section of the story in which they appear.  This would be a great edition of the story for use in a combined British Lit/British History class or any literature class where students might not have the background knowledge necessary to fully imagine this wonderful text in their minds.<br /><br />The greatest drawback for the book is the use of new illustrations by artist Nicollet.  Nicollet's artwork comes across more like political cartoons than true representations of the characters.  Holmes's perpetually bored expression, horrid green suits, and thin to the point of illness frame are distracting, but it is the droopy eyed, loose jowled and much older Watson who is truly misleading.  Nicollet obviously gave in to the movies of the 30s to 50s which cast Watson as the much older idiot, rather than the apparently attractive gentleman presented in the original texts.  I would have much preferred for Nicollet to depend on Sidney Paget for inspiration, or simply to see Paget's originals presented.  The book draws so much on real history and historic allusion that it's a shame to so misrepresent the main characters in the original illustrations.
B00009Z574|3.0|as a whole, Tormato is pretty awful.  However when you break it apart, it's an interesting listen to look back on, because it clearly delineates where the band's factions were headed.  by 1978, classic prog had become either repetitive or just plain bad, and bands that could evolve would survive(such as Rush and Genesis).  on Tormato there is an obvious attempt to update the Yes sound, clashing with an attempt to remain static.    The best aspect of Tormato is the combo of Chris Squire and Alan White, whose energy and imagination reflect the changing scene.  Most of their contributions, particularly \\"Release, Release\\" and \\"...Silent Wings...\\" contain the rock aspects of early New Wave and straight Rock, while retaining Prog musicianship.  They are clearly moving in that direction, leading to their 80s success.    the worst of Tormato comes from the combo of Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman; they are clearly stuck in 1974.  As an example, i give you \\"Madrigal\\", the only song not to include Squire and White.  Wakeman, whose techically brilliant playing usually makes up for his soul-less compositions, offers the same stale ideas he'd played throughout the 70s.  His choice of harpsichord underscores his complete reliance on his baroque/classical style, and his interjections throughout the more grooving tunes are absolutely out of place.    this album marks the start of Anderson's decline as a lyricist.  the formless ramblings of \\"Madrigal\\" are again out of place with the scene, and much more suited to his solo \\"Olias of Sunhillow\\"(if you think i just hate Anderson, i thought \\"Olias\\" is a great New Age album).  he had not yet reached the point of constantly singing about the universe, love, and the powers of imagination, but his lyrics here are pretty unbearable.  listening to subsequent solo albums of Anderson and Wakeman, you really don't see much positive evolution.    Steve Howe's playing is a mixed bag.  \\"Release Release\\" has great Police-like rhythm, while \\"Silent Wings\\" and \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\" have some nice fills.  \\"Future Times\\" features some of his most unpleasant playing, particularly during the verses.  His choice of guitar sound on \\"Onward\\" just plain sucks; listen to the live \\"Keys to Ascension\\" version for wonderful warmer version.    by 1980, classic Prog was long gone.  Rush had \\"Permanent Waves\\", Genesis had \\"Duke\\", ELP and KC were dead.  free of Anderson and Wakeman, the remaining Yes-men were prepared to offer a fresh sound, starting with the fantastic \\"Drama\\" album, and running through the Trevor Rabin era(don't bitch, purists, they weren't supposed to be Yes at that point...record company decision), with Howe finding huge success with Asia.  Anderson did his New Age thing on and off, and Wakeman continued to be brilliant yet boring.    to remain successful, bands must evolve...Tormato was a vital, albeit ugly, step in the right direction.

0399237720|5.0|Excellent book to use for counting, hands on the children, good size, toy the same as the book.
1594489505|5.0|In Khaled Hosseini's bestseller A Thousand Splendid Suns, curiosity and mystery grasp readers from the beginning. Being born out of wedlock, Mariam has an unordinary youth that foreshadows unpredictable future. Nana, her mother, gives great love and care. However, her dual personality towards Mariam causes distrust. On the other hand, Jalil, her father, shows kindness and warmhearted attitudes toward her. His logical explanations make perfect sense to this five-year-old girl, while Nana seems to tell lies on everything. When Mariam reaches old enough to identify and judge by herself, she takes an action she would regret in the future.            Women's lives in Afghanistan are unfair and miserable. They are often treated as ignorant humans or baby-producers. Men think that women \\"are not able to think like they can.\\" Becoming a burden to a husband after giving birth is a matter of time. Mariam also suffers from this realistic, crude society. Staying home for weeks is a common part. Her identity, beauty, personality, and freedom get blocked from burqa. By looking at Rasheed's terrible attitude towards her, readers feel anger and rage.            Meanwhile, Afghanistan goes out of control. Demonstrations, Soviet's surrender, and Taliban's tyranny drive citizens into huge chaos. Families, friends, and cities are utterly destroyed from civil wars and terrorist attacks. As Taliban takes control over Afghanistan, its new barbaric rules suppress women's activities and rights. All important facilities such as hospitals and schools are not available to women anymore. This horrible situation also affects another pretty woman's romantic life.            Beautiful Laila has two brothers in a war and a best friend Tariq. She awakens the true love as she grows up. Imaginations of kissing and making love fill her mind. When her romantic life ripens, the world turns gray. Wars and terrorists reverse everything. Poor Laila has to withstand and overcome her new environment.The changed fate never goes back to normal, but she learns to live with harsh situations.             These two women, Mariam and Laila, encounter numerous life-threatening moments and dilemmatic situations. Escaping for the better environment through risking their lives is simply too hard to comprehend their desperate needs. Mothers' tremendous care for baby outruns the strength of lashes and antennas. Their fearless actions surprise and paralyze readers. However, numerous other Afghanistan women are in the same situations.      Through excellent flow of this story, nothing can stop readers from being curious about what will happen next. The amazing plot represents a graph with numerous curves and one peak at the last step. At the beginning, the story starts with Afghanistan's surprising culture. Mariam's young life contains vivid and thoughtful moments. As the chapters go on, another story appears similarly to the first one. The plot seems to portray one girl's love life, but they two intersect with the author's strong writing skills. The coincidences may seem as fairy tales, but detailed descriptions about characters' relationship with each other provide realistic sense. By using two different people's perspectives, the story becomes much closer to the readers. Hosseini combines omniscience and limited omniscience perfectly. The readers would often feel wearing two people's shoes repetitively. The flow goes upward very smoothly until the two thirds of the book, and extremely steep at the last part. The climax grips readers' full attention. Needless to say, the ending wraps up lovely.     Furthermore, excellent hooks squeeze readers. The author exactly knows when to slow down and when to hook them. From Mariam's tragic experience to her bravery, the book contains everything to spellbind readers. All the detailed events are thrilling; sometimes, they show ultimate consequences that could paralyze the whole atmosphere. Rosy romance provides fresh and smooth flow, sothat when it breaks, readers would scream, frustrate, and cry.     Hosseini had fantastic scheme of depicting Afghanistan women's lives by showing society's cruelty, using tight, organized plot, and hooking the readers with thrilling events. Through two women's challenging, thrilling stories, the author's plan works smoothly and clearly. Once this book gets to the hands, they will never drop the book until the end of it.

B0013D8LOU|5.0|I am a Sondheim fan. I can't help it! I get addicted to anything he's written and composed. When I first listened to the original cast recording of Sweeney Todd on a lonely Halloween night  a few years ago (True Story!) I had chills of fright and of excitement! The music was so hauntingly beautiful and the lyrics had impeccable timing comedic and otherwise. I was helplessly hooked! I had a nightmare or two but I welcomed them (they weren't that scary in retrospect). And one evening while listening to it I had a thought... \\"Johnny Depp would make a GREAT Sweeney if they made this musical into a film... providing that I play Mrs. Lovett opposite him!\\" (LOL) It was just a simple idea that I presumed would NEVER happen... but dream came true (well the Johnny Depp half of it) in December 2007! I was jumping for joy and I got my ticket in advance to see this movie... by myself even! I saw the trailer and heard Depp's singing and I was taken aback... in a good way. His version of Sweeney was violently ruthless and he was on key! It was a different style of singing though... a kind of rock ballad style. It played against the same lush musical score like cayenne pepper in hot cocoa. I realized at once that this must be seen as an ACQUIRED TASTE. Musical theatre lovers seemed livid at the fact that Depp was not singing operatically. But they forgot... this is a MOVIE musical. NOT a STAGE musical. If I were to look for operatic style singing I would go to the theatre where it belongs. But if I wanted to see the stage version toned down in certain characters (Mrs. Lovett for example), and see more dramatic effects (Blood, blood and MORE blood), and just as fabulous looking costumes, I'll see Tim Burton's version of Sweeney Todd. I love this movie because of its different take on the stage musical. I'll cherish them both until I die! Dare to be different! Try something new! Become cultured in the art of acquired tastes! ^_^
B000NQPZCO|5.0|I remember catching Donnie Brasco in the theater and thinking it was stupendous back in 1997. The entire cast is as solid as Goodfellas ... or any other movie for that matter. Initially I held off from buying the Blu-Ray because I wasn't sure if the film stock of '97 would have all of the detail that high-def reveals, but this transfer is excellent. The few scenes that seem kind of soft are outweighed by the 99% of beautiful footage. I especially enjoyed the extra scenes added back into the film. I remember the theatrical release seemed to skim over Donnie's home life because there was so much story to tell about him infiltrating the mob. Now I see they actually had tons of footage of his marriage with Anne Heche's character. Normally extended versions have stuff that you think could have remained on the cutting room floor. In this case, every bit of it belonged back in the film. I regret that I didn't get to see all of that footage on the big screen, but now a high def at home is like having the big screen at your house. Like every other reviewer has mentioned Depp, Pacino, Madsen, Bruno Kirby and Anne Heche make the best cast possible. It's a must for any Blu-Ray library.
B001041JLE|5.0|Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" is such a timeless album. This album will always be the greatest of all time. Why?  Because no one makes good music like this anymore. My parents, who have always been big country music fans, had this album on record.  That just shows how much Michael broke down barriers.   I was 2 years old when the original album came out and as I grew older and became a fan I bought this album on cassette tape. When the 25th anniversary edition came out I had to get this puppy on CD and of course get the deluxe edition with never before seen pictures.  The original songs are still awesome of course.  The remixes are ok. \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" with Akon and \\"Beat It\\" with Fergie are my favorite. \\"Billie Jean\\" with Kanye West is alright...the beat is good. However, Billie Jean is the kind of classic song that maybe should have been left alone.  And \\"For all time\\" is such a beautiful song.  It is amazing that this album is selling better than current artists 25 years later. But not that amazing considering the type of album this is and the genius who made it.  Plus, I think it is great that people who were not around when the original album came out can finally see what the fuss was about.    Michael Jackson is the greatest artist in history and this album, \\"Thriller\\" is the greatest as well.    Hopefully, Michael will give us new music sometime in the future. The music industry needs him. If you haven't bought this album yet then you are missing out.  Go out and get the album; it is well worth it.

0735619670|4.0|This was a great book both for me and my team. I've been in the software industry for many years. I started building a team of developers and needed an easy way to bring novice and experienced programmers together on a similar set of standards. This book provided us with the perfect framework from which to start our team. We've developed several major projects using the principles in this book and have experienced a great deal of success.    One warning, the book gets a bit tedious after the first half. If you're looking to improve your C programming skills, it gets really detailed into pointers and other fun, or not, stuff. Also, the examples are in VB.NET...but you still get the point.
0375703764|5.0|I came across some references to House of Leaves and was intrigued by the reviews.  I became even more interested when my local library told me they didn't have it and didn't have any plans to get it.  Hmmmmm.  I came home and ordered it, then waited for this masterpiece that people either obsess over or hate entirely to get here.  I flipped through it when it arrived to see what all the hype was about.  My first impression was that it was a cluster...erm...mess.  All of the strange formatting and different fonts made it seem horribly busy and my impression was that someone had gone out of his way to make a statement.  Ah, the disappointment.    Not one to give up, I resigned myself to start the book and see where it led me.  Only a few pages in (hooked), I made the executive decision to arm myself with those little page-marker sticky notes so I could go back and re-visit things of interest.  Superficially, the challenge at first is to develop your own tempo in reading between the story (The Navidson Report) and the narrative.  It took a little getting used to but once I got the hang of it, I actually found that it added to the story.  This is expounded on further into the book when the strange formatting and page layout comes into play.  What I'd thought would be a horribly distracting, PITA gimmick turned out to be an integral part of the story.  Yes, in a few places it was a bit distracting.  However, in most places it heightened the reading experience and upped the creepy factor exponentially.  In some spots I actually found myself holding my breath as I turned the pages, not physically able to read fast enough to keep up with the suspense and dismay that was building as I read.  Wow.  My copy is littered with those sticky page-markers.  Yeah, its that good and I found myself embracing its complexity.  It grows on you.    This book has more layers than an onion.  There is symbolism and foreshadowing galore, and a multitude of hidden codes within the text.  Somefolks will only catch the blatantly obvious, but the more astute people will catch the subtle 'secret' codes that have been painstakingly included.  Everything in there has been carefully placed for a reason.  I found after I read it the first time that the fun of reading it a second time is that you know what happens so you can pay even closer attention to the hidden goodies.  Keep some page markers handy as you read so that you can go back and analyze the things that caught your eye on the first read.    When you're finished, I strongly suggest that you visit the HoL forum on the Internet.  There are people who have picked this book apart and I guarantee you will be astounded by what you've missed and what others have found.    I loved the interactive experience of this book.  It is a highly personal experience for the reader. A lot of the underlying messages and tones (and codes) can be interpreted in a multitude of ways, leaving plenty of room for the book to mean something entirely personal to you as a reader.  It is artistic, experimental, and a fun read.  I strongly recommend it.
B000GFLE86|1.0|I really like Peyroux's first two albums - she has a lovely voice - but this one left me cold. The first track is very good, and the title track isn't bad - almost everything else is dull and lifeless. Some of the covers are frankly awful. If you are coming to this artist for the first time I strong advise you to try [[ASIN:B0002NRRAG Careless Love]] or [[ASIN:B000002JAX Dreamland]] dreamland first. This one seems to have been airbrushed to smooth out anything interesting.
B000069HJM|4.0|Yes,I am a Supertramp fan, but I am far from hardcore.  I think I am more in a place to judge fairly.      Bottom line:  This is a solid album for expanding one's Supertramp catalog beyond their more known albums (specifically: Crime, Breakfast, and Brother -- if you do not have these, definitely get these first)    This album is really quite good.  The songwriting, performance, and orchestrations are very good.  After listening to this album quite a few times, many of the scathing reviews are unfair.  Really.  I almost passed on this album entirely.  I am REALLY glad I didn't.     I know this album will not solve world peace, but -- at the end of the day -- it is a very good listen if you like Supertramp.    PS  And don't miss the sweet guitar solo in 'An Awful Thing To Waste'
1400034779|4.0|Do not be deceived by the apparent simplicity of this novel upon first turning its pages. Although it initially appears to  be such, the underlying insights into people and their reasons for doing what they do, is quite profound. Mma Ramotswe owns the only ladies' detective agency in Botswana, and through this book the reader follows her as she embarks upon solving one case after another. This makes the reading quite neat; yes, there are threads and cases that are resolved through the course of the book, but mostly a case is solved in every few chapters. Hence in some ways it reads like a collection of shorts about the same character, a bit like a serialised novel, I guess.<br />The humour in the novel is infectious, the chapter where Mma Ramotswe solves a case for the powerful Mr Patel, had me grinning widely.<br /><br />Moreover, the book is very balanced in its outlook on people, and I appreciate its honesty there, it recognises how divergent human nature can be, presents the good with pride and the bad as something that can be overcome in many cases by good people everywhere.<br /><br />McCall-Smith's love for Botswana and all things Botswanan is tastefully evident throughout, to the extent that it would not surprise me if many a person upon reading a book in the series were to have a desire instilled to travel to this place themselves for  a holiday!<br /><br />I really liked Mmma Ramotswe and her outlook on life. She seems such a positive, straight (in the sense of no alterior motive, what you see is what you get) person (in spite of having faced some life-changing challenges, which the reader is reminded of regularly). Her philosophy: \\"I love all the people God made... It is my duty to help them solve the mysteries in their lives\\".<br /><br />Future reading:I would not hesitate to move on to the other books in the series, or to recommend it to other readers.<br /><br />The BBC has produced this as a film, which I intend to watch next, if I can get my hands on it!it!
0385495323|5.0|great book regarding the history of cryptography. The only way to truly understand anything is c the history of it's introduction
B0010YSD7M|4.0|The movie is good. I marked it 4 stars because some of the dialog was long and drawn out.  Basically, I feel this movie could have been shortened and made into a single episode. However, some of the character commentary and even some of the scenes were a bit drawn out.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was good, and at least brings some closure to the team's final struggle.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This was such a great buy and having all the dvd's in one place just makes it so so cool. The packaging is awesome as well.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult's most touching novel, My Sister's Keeper, is a story about a girl Kate who has struggled with leukemia since childhood. Kate's sister, Anna, was mainly born to be a donor to Kate because their bone marrows match. Anna has gone through numerous surgeries and operations to help her sister fighting the cancer. However, as Anna grows up, she starts questioning who she really is and her decisions have separated her from her family; Picoult's tone in this book will make you feel sympathy for Anna, but on the other hand it is hard to realize the struggles that the family has undergone.      My Sister's Keeper is one of fourteen novels by Picoult, who is an Internationally Bestselling Author. The style she uses in this novel is very unique. There are several different persons' points of view alternating so you can clearly feel their thoughts. Her voice is clear and she does amazingly at describing the scenes and the actions. \\"The veins on Kate's neck and chest are a road map highways that don't go anywhere. I [Anna] trick myself into believing that I can see those rogue leukemia cells moving like a rumor through her system\\" (167). The subtlety she uses can help the readers to vividly go into the story. Above all, she does not give away the details so quickly; she tells the story gradually so it will not take your attention away.      This book is a page-turner especially when you read to the end because the plots are connected tightly to make you keep reading. There are not a lot of characters in the novel; however, due to the style of Picoult's writing, you can really stand on each character's side and imagine their feelings. When Kate's mother, Sara, sits in the hospital staring at Kate while she is sleeping, \\"I pull my chair closer to the hospital bed `Do you remember the summer we signed you up for camp? ...I told you to get a seat on the left side of the bus, so that when it pulled away, you'd be able to look back and see me there...you get that same seatin Heaven. One where you can watch me, watching you'\\" (326). There are some specific plots where your tears suddenly crawl over your face before you even notice.       The uses of clichés are common in fiction writings. However, there are not too many clichés in My Sister's Keeper, but there is some part that will make you question about. Although Sara's concerns about Kate's health are understandable, her reaction sometimes make the readers feel like she does not really have sympathy for Anna and her contributions. Both of them are her daughters, she should treat them equally, but since Kate is the one who is sick and needs to take more care of, Sara tends to treat Kate better. This is the part that will make reader to think more thoroughly why this happens and where Sara is really facing as a mother.      There are lots of ways to interpret this whole story and its ending. The rise and fall of the plots strengthen readers' curiosity. The unexpected and unpredictable plots always come out and they are sometimes out of your predictions. Picoult does not write a story that sounds totally not true, but a story that might have happened in real life which makes the readers to think more realistically. As you think more realistically, your reactions and emotions towards this novel will become much stronger and sincerer. Finally, when you find yourself enjoying the novel, you will understand why this is a bestseller book because almost everyone likes to read page-turner.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I have been waiting for years to purchase the definitive edition of this movie and it has finally arrived. No, I didn't go crazy and buy the super deluxe, suitcase, with the wings from the dove bonus collectible, etc... sure one or two of the extras on that version sound cool but for me this is just the right amount of material.<br /><br />What can I say, the film looks and sounds amazing - I was fortunate to have seen it re-released at The Ziegfeld in NYC but being able to watch it again and again is wonderful. I must say I was a bit disappointed with Ridley's commentary as he rambles quite a bit and does not seem to be watching the movie after a while as his comments often do not relate to what is on screen. He just doesn't seem that focused or enthusiastic about the process.<br /><br />However the 'making of' segments are phenomenal - a filmmaker or film lovers dream! Tons of development information, behind the scenes decisions, fights, etc. Very educational, informative and engaging and worth the price just for these segments alone.
0316166685|4.0|\\"My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name, Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" The first time the narrator, Susie, appeared in The Lovely Bones, was dead already. Susie was raped and brutally murdered at the age of 14. However, her spirit remained and was able to tell the story from a first person, omniscient view. If the story of a 14-year-old girl being raped, murdered and hacked was reported by media, it could definitely astonish the society and create a sensation. If it was published as a novel, it would most likely become a whodunit or a thriller that attracts readers by its plots. But the author, Alice Sebold, developed her own style, shifted the focus from the suspense to the emotional impact and expressed the beauty of family love. The Lovely Bones was a story about how people face the dead. Susie was dead. She was. But it was she in the book that was telling us the story, and commenting on everything that happened to her friends in the real world. She talked like she was right there, but she was only a visional looker-on.  Susie watched everything and recalled her memory. Even though she experienced horrible violence, she still missed the real world. She could feel everyone's thoughts but she couldn't do or express anything except for recording what she has seen. The scene changed between Susie's memory, Susie's heaven and the real world. The idea of heaven was one of the highlights in the book. Everyone has their own heaven. Susie described her heaven as a world that included all her \\"simplest desires but also the most humble and grand.\\" Her heaven looked like a school. But there was no teacher, and she only went to her favorite art class. The textbooks were Seventeen and Vogue. She lived in a big house she always wanted and had cute dogs companying her. \\"The heaven is not about safety just as, in its graciousness, it isn't about gritty reality. We have fun.\\" The heaven was a place where you could get everything you desired. People are always pursuing their maximum satisfaction of desire. But Susie's biggest wish was not owning anything, but being alive again. She wanted to go back to her family and re-immerse herself into a loving ambience. But this was the only wish that couldn't become true.   Susie's death was like a stone that hit the surface of a river; the ripples represent the impact of her death on different people. Susie stood on the position of a dead, watched her family and friends after she vanished, and watched their lives unfold after hers has ended. Salmons collapsed after the disaster happened. Mr. and Mrs. Salmon's marriage couldn't last without her as an important connection. Mom's escape, dad's
0800179501|3.0|I'm not proud of it, but I will confess:  I've seen THE KARATE KID more than once.  And because of this film's adolescent annoyance, I really have no explanation.  I truly believe Ralph Macchio has yet to shave; Pat Morita (\\"Wax on, wax off,\\") should have stayed on the set of \\"Happy Days\\"; blond William Zabka is about as menacing a bully as a yapping chihuahua; and Elisabeth Shue appeared in this film long before she hit her glorious sensuous stride.  The haircuts are a riot, the music relentlessly myopic, and while watching this campy caper I have the unmistakable taste of bubblegum haunting my mouth.<br /><br />Yet I continue to take in this sappy marshmallow yarn--a story about a displaced (and annoying) New Jersey teen suddenly transplanted to the left coast with its yuppie culture and peach-fuzzed Cobra Kais.  Our young hero must learn to defend himself, he must learn karate, and what better way to absorb the martial arts than under the careful tutelage of an eccentric Japanese maintenance man?<br /><br />Hey, it works for me.<br /><br />I can't explain it--maybe I'm a glutton for hokey--but this is a feel-good story that will put a smirk on your mug.  Plus THE KARATE KID gives us at least two cinematic legends:  the shower curtain costume and the infamous, \\"Sweep the leg.\\"  That's worth two extra viewings right there.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:1413406114 Walk-On]]
0385338724|5.0|Kinsella makes the reader care about Lexi.  At first her shallow interests make you wonder if she's up to being the heroine but she \\"grows on you.\\"  Lexi transforms from being a bit of a loser, into the woman who has it all.  Due to a 3-year memory gap (from an accident), she struggles to comprehend how she ended up with the perfect marriage to a wealthy man and being the boss in a high-powered job.  Gradually she realizes that along the way, she's lost all her friends, and now without her memory, may lose her job, and even the husband.  To make it even trickier, there are family issues and a possible new love interest.<br />Kinsella knows how to pull these elements together and there's humor and angst before it all ends.<br />I'm eager to read another Kinsella, so I hope she's working on it now.
0307265730|3.0|As much as I admire Ms. Lahiri for her remarkable writing skills, I was disappointed with her new book. I've been a big fan of hers ever since I read 'The Interpreter of Maladies' but as I was reading 'The Namesake' and 'Unaccustomed Earth' over the past few years I could not help but feeling that her subject matters are very limited and characters are always the same. She seems to find the stories only from her own family and the range of her experiences is very narrow. It is still enjoyable to read her writings but it would be nice to read about something else, beyond her own family history (that is, stories about London-born, Americanized, Ivy-league educated young people of the Bengali origins)
B000EGCITG|5.0|I really like this PINK CD.  I got it mainly for the song \\"Who Knew\\" but I pretty much like the rest of her songs too.  I also like U & Ur Hand and didn't know it was on this CD - so that was a good surprise.
B000EJ9N6Y|2.0|Not sure if I just don't like the songs they've chosen to redo here so much, or if the problem is that nothing interesting or new has been done with them. Either way, I only end up listening to \\"killing moon\\" \\"Bela Lugosi's dead\\" and a couple others. The self-titled album was great throughout.
B0013FBS20|5.0|The theatrical version is a truncated cheapshot rating 2 stars for Will Smith's poignant acting & Francis Lawrence's elegant directing. The ALTERNATE ENDING VERSION IS A FIVE-STAR CLASSIC on par with \\"Pan's Labyrinth,\\" \\"Hostel\\" and \\"The Kingdom\\" in depicting the harsh reality of human existence buffeted my forces they strive to control. Like these other films, \\"Legend's\\" touchstones are political torture, animal testing & xenophobia. Rewards devotees with multiple viewings in subtle \\"butterfly\\" and \\"cocoon\\" imagery that enriches the experience to an almost unbearable pitch. Simply exquisite.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Here we are with Faceless.  I love the heaviness of this album.  From the first song you know that this is going to be good.  I believe that this \\"new\\" Godsmack was an attempt to shed any AIC influence whatsoever, and it actually works out to their favor.  I don't believe we'll have a Godsmack II for a long time, if ever.  The fire of the dual and triple Rectifiers blast through the speakers and sounds blissful.  Definitely something for your rock parties.  The strong points on this album are the heavy aggressive riffing and the guitar solos, and the killer drum fills.  The hint of AIC in this production would be the closer, much like on Alice in Chains' last album, where they closed with Over Now, but that's pretty much it.  Faceless picked up where Awake left off, and does so in spectacular fashion.  True, there are filler tracks on this album, and some of them are actually pretty good once you get used to them.  Personal favorites are I Am, Dead and Broken, Changes, Realign, and Straight out of Line.  I've noticed more of a James Hetfield influence in Sully's singing on this album, and it especially shines on the song Faceless, which is another one of my favorites.  Overall, Godsmack is starting to find their niche with this album.  The songwriting is good, and sounds more original than their debut, nothing against the debut album, but this is Godsmack the band, not the Alice in Chains cover band they started out as.  If Straight Out of Line is the first time you've ever heard a Godsmack song, listen to their debut, pick it up if you like it.  Chances are, you may or may not like it, but go from there and you can see where Godsmack came from and where they are right now.  Highly recommended.
B0010HOZXA|4.0|\\"No Reservations\\" is excellent behind-the-scenes glimpse at food-and-beverage business and an excellent movie.  The pressures of keeping the service, quality of food and the customers pleased is brief but real.  Smooth operation of the every day of a restaurant is dictated by the staff on duty at that moment.  The dialogue. plot, action, and acting did present that \\"movie\\" feel but a real-life sensation.

B000UR366S|4.0|While I was at first put off by the opening instrumental on multiple listenings it really does fit.  The songs remind me of an earlier Joni without sounding rehashed.  A must for any Joni fan.  I don't patronize Starbucks so I would have liked to have seen an earlier wide release.
B000EGDB10|4.0|\\"This mission will self destruct in five seconds\\". That is a classic line in movie history that everyone should know. Mission Impossible is based on the popular TV series that spawned 7 seasons. This motion picture adaptation is a wonderful treat indeed, it includes espionage, action, suspense you name it this movie hits the nail on the spot. The only thing about the movie that..well isn't bad but troublesome is the plot which is quite confusing but then again that is what makes the film shine; so yeah if I where you I would give the movie a couple of multiple viewings in order to comprehend the film's plot.<br /><br />The movie's plot surrounds Tom Cruise' character of Ethan Hunt, IMF agent (Impossible Mission Force) Who looses his team of spies in a mission gone bad. It seems that there is a list known as the NOC list, which contains the names of all the agents working for the agency, if stolen or obtained by the wrong source it could jeopardize every agent in the force. So without ruining the movie it's all about Treason and it requires a lot of thinking and observation... In a way the viewer must behave as a spy in order to understand it and notice the tiniest important detail. So as I said it may require second viewing, in my case I had to watch it 4 times in order to understand it completely.<br /><br />The only thing that I found a bit silly is the last action sequence in the train; it feels out of place as if the movie out of nowhere changed genre from espionage to action. Also the film is kind of dated but it won't ruin the movie's plot which is phenomenal. Last thing make sure that when you buy it that it is the special collectors edition. I say this because of experience; the standard version is presented in a letterboxed format. Which means that if played on a plasma HD screen it will look horendous, due to the fact that it is not enhaced for 16:9 screens. If you have a regular 4:3 screens then I guess it's okay to buy the cheaper standard one, the special edition doesn't include many special features anyway.  So yeah great movie, a bit confusing but phenomenal. Definitely a must have.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5oesn't include many special features anyway.  So yeah great movie, a bit confusing but phenomenal. Definitely a must have.       MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5

0670018651|5.0|After reading \\"The Emperor of Scent\\", I was curious about Turin's fabled fragrance reviews.  Having at one time compounded, if not invented fragrance mixtures for a major candle maker, I still have a fascination for the scents that capture peoples emotions in a timeless way.  I purchased this book at the first mention of it's pre-publication status, and it does not disappoint!  I have only glanced at a few pages, and it delivers as promised.  If you ever wondered what the difference was in the overwhelming plethora of fragrances, whether classic or pop, this book will quickly allow you to develop a knowledgeable nose for the fragrance counter, and if cocktail hour expertise is your forte, this will add to your arsenal of quips in short order.  Bravo! Turin and Sanchez!
156224003X|5.0|Please get involved with this product. I was at a fellow musician's home in Sydney about 6 years ago when I first read this book. Since then I have changed from an uptight, crappy player into a player who gets noticed, has \\"chops\\" and one who can find peace in playing. Like the man says, I used to approach the piano with trepidation - now, like Kenny, the piano seat is the most comfortable in the house for me. I have even prescribed this book to my students. IF YOU WANT TO BE A MUSICIAN, YOU MUST READ THIS. I repeat   READ THIS NOW  - BEFORE YOU WASTE HALF YOUR LIFE (like I did) WONDERING WHY YOU CAN'T PLAY LIKE \\"A HEAVY\\".
B00003CXC7|3.0|It's summer in New York, but L. B. \\"Jeff\\" Jefferies (James Stewart) is trapped in his apartment with a severely broken leg.  Aside from the daily visits from his nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) and girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), his only diversion is watching the people in the apartment complex out his back window.  And since it is the middle of a horrid heat wave, everyone has their window open at all times.<br /><br />Late one night, Jeff witness something funny going on across the way.  The invalid wife in one of the apartments has vanished and the husband (Raymond Burr) is taking many trips out of the apartment carrying something in his suitcase.  Jeff quickly assumes the wife was murdered.  Enlisting Lisa and Stella's help, he tries to prove it.  But is he right?  And can he prove it without leaving his own apartment?<br /><br />I seem to have a weird relationship with Hitchcock.  I don't enjoy the movies everyone considers his masterpieces, but I do enjoy his lesser known films.  In keeping with this tradition, I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would.  The beginning of the film was very slow as the many side stories were set up.  Even once the main story got going, I still found it rather slow for my tastes.  The ending, however, was exciting if a bit predictable.  And the acting was great, bringing the characters to life.<br /><br />I'm definitely going to keep watching Hitchcock's films.  But I'm going to explore all his films to see which ones I think are his best.  I doubt that this one, while not his worst, will make the list of his best either.
B000KCHWCC|3.0|Thin white duke-ing it out with god while lathered in the period-defined gestalt of Gibran mingled with contemporaneous man/superman/machine doodling that apes either Nietzsche and/or the plot outline of \\"The Forbin Project\\", we must be satisfied mostly in knowing that meetings are already set for the next bardo (a 7 to 49 day visit depending on your behavior while on this plane o' being). Which makes \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" a charming but merely transitional record for Bowie. Here he strives to set aside his memories of a free festival by being fitted for mock madness and women's clothing -- just one look at the restored cover art should give pause to the \\"heavy metal\\" theorists here among us and hear it instead as it is: The trial balloon for Bowie's more successful marketing of a seemingly dangerous/thrilling androgyny that finds its better expression not within \\"The Width of a Circle\\", but rather when all at last became \\"Hunky Dory\\". Bowie proves it's no fluke by then going on to realize the full mutation of Ziggy and Aladdin, each a more mature and more deliberate record than this. Hey, you gotta re-restart somewhere...
B00009P1O2|4.0|The rock band Queen formed in England in 1972.  Although several critics admired their earliest releases, the public remained largely indifferent until the 1974 SHEER HEART ATTACK, which jolted the band to fame in both England and America--and throughout the 1970s Queen generated one major recording success after another with A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, A DAY AT THE RACES, and NEWS OF THE WORLD.  Even so, the band often provoked a \\"love it or hate it\\" reaction; they offered an odd mixture of thundering hard rock, English musical hall, and progressive sound in a \\"glamrock\\" package, and as time passed American audiences found it less and less appealing--particularly when dogged by rumors about lead singer Freddie Mercury's sexuality and the sexually \\"ify\\" nature of the band's name itself.<br /><br />By the early 1980s those controversies, shifts in musical tastes, and the band's extremely ill-advised gig at the segregated South African resort of Sun City effectively knocked Queen out of the lucrative American market.  But something unexpected happened: Queen, which had long been a concert favorite in Asia and Europe, emerged as the world's premiere stadium concert act, and quite suddenly the American market was almost irrelevant.  Who cares about New York and Los Angeles when you have out-charted every one from Elvis Presley to the Beatles and when you are the single biggest concert draw in world history?<br /><br />In 1986 Queen played England's Wembley Stadium, one of the largest venues in Europe, performing two concerts (one in a rainstorm) to sold out audiences.  The concert was filmed, and it presents a great band that clearly had a great talent for playing to such incredibly large audiences.<br /><br />When you listen to Queen's most popular releases you listen to a band that knows how to work a recording studio to the nth degree--and so it is very easy to forget exactly how atheletic and musically muscular Queen was.  WEMBLEY reminds you of the fundamental facts in no uncertain terms: four band members, a single back up musician to pick up occasional phrases here and there, and that was it.  And they clearly do everything but tear Wembley Stadium down to the ground.<br /><br />At this point in the band's history concerts focused tightly around lead singer Freddie Mercury, who had a unique talent for dominating the massive audiences to which he played: handsome, muscular, he is all over the stage--and then there is that voice.  Mercury is said to have had a four-octave range, and while his upper registers were too delicate for the demands of the concert stage you don't doubt it for a minute.  This is a voice as delicate as a trembling candle flame, as roaring as bonfire, and shifting between both extremes without the faintest sign of strain or effort.  And the band is behind him every inch of the way: Brian May, lead guitar, is a legendary performer in his own right, and bassist John Deacon and drummer Roger Taylor are rock solid as well.<br /><br />That said, however, the film itself is actually only so-so, and the reason is very obvious: the editing.  The thing consists of one flash cut after another, bouncing from Mercury to May to Taylor and shortchanging Deacon in the process.  We have plenty of close ups, and very often some remarkable shots of the crowd--\\"Radio Gaga\\" is particularly extraordinary in this--but we seldom actually get to see the band as a whole.  The endless cuts become more than a little wearing after a while and they ultimately undercut the energy of the concert itself.<br /><br />The producers make up for this a little bit on the bonus disk, which includes a feature that allows you to focus exclusively on one performer at a time over the course of a few songs.  The bonus disk also includes several documentaries that range from the \\"fair enough\\" to the \\"very good.\\"  Queen was a great live band, no doubt about it; the film falls short of that, but even so it reminds you very clearly of what Freddie, Brian,John, and Roger could do when they put their minds to it.  It also has a certain poignancy, particularly when Mercury remarks that the band will stay together until they die, particularly given that Mercury very likely knew at this point that he was HIV positive and would not be able to tour much longer.  He would be dead five years later.  Strongly recommended in spite of flaws.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerds to it.

B000YAA68C|5.0|A beautifully intricate plot that metes out humor and grief in regular measured doses. Death, mysticism and psychology are intricately married alongside rather intelligent wit and occasional slapschtick. Swank and Butler are both sexy, gorgeous, brilliant and perfectly cast. Lisa Kudrow is the only weak link, as per usual, as it always seems like she simply walked into the wrong door (from the Friends studio); but I got used to her by my fourth or fifth viewing. Death is handled as frankly and productively as in Meet Joe Black - one of my other favorites. For thems what loves a good laugh, cry, laugh, cry, laugh, cry, with a little sex and magic, this gem is virtually flawless.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|What more could I add to all the accolades the series has received.  But I couldn't keep slient.  This is the BEST BBC Production to this date, at least in my opinion!    \\"North and South\\" is one my favorite books of all times so I was watching the series with critical eyes. Once I finished the series, I bought the DVD and have been watching it at least once a week ever since.      Acting in this series is just superb!  It's amazing how much Richard Arimatage was able to convey so much of tormented psych of Thornton so accurately.  His subtle glances, facial expressions and the slight movements all are just John Thornton himself (5 stars for Richard Armitage!!).  Deniela is a perfect Margaret with just the right amount of haughtiness and not to mention the incredible acting from all the supporting casts...  Did I mention the hauntingly beautiful music, great camera work, editting, etc. etc.      If you haven't seen the series, please go rent, barrow or buy it.  You are missing out on a lot...
0671027344|2.0|I read this book for the first time recently, well aware that many of my friends when I was in high school (I'm currently a senior in college) raved about it and considered the book one of their favorites as an absolutely necessary read.  I can see why they believed that (they probably still do) but I guess I just don't see the light.    There have been other reviews which comment on this, but the sheer amount of clichéd teen-angst drama make for a jumbled and highly unrealistic mess.  People who loved this book have told me it that encapsulated what it was like to grow up in high school.  Really?  While issues like sex, hardcore drug and alcohol use, peer pressure and abuse, dealing with death and suicide and having some pretty severe sexual abuse problems certainly exist as fragments of adolescent lives, the idea that all of these issues and more can barrage a kid in one calendar year is too unrealistic for me to handle or relate to.  Does a friend's suicide and sexual abuse need to even be part of this book to make it poignant and accessible?  Teens, for all their supposed angst and emotional problems, also for the most part live pretty normal and healthy lives with spots of trouble that generally fade in significance as they mature and experience life.  When teens read books like this,  I'm willing to bet they are more likely to think they are as \\"deep\\" and \\"conflicted\\" as people like Charlie or Holden Caufield than they really are.  It's as if teenagers need to read literature that says, \\"you're life is complex, unique and desperate\\" when most are truthfully not.      This is another book to be read with self-importance and pseudo-self awareness that invokes all the worst and rare parts of growing up and not enough of the quiet memories and stable lives which most kids have.  Life can be complex and meaningful outside of tragedy and it's a shame that an author who writes in such an accessible prose chose to go the easy path and formulate a story that could befound in a bad lifetime movie.  Read it if you want to, but don't believe the hype.    By the way, \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" was one of my favorite books as a teenager and it still ranks up there.  Looking back, I believe that I was one of those victims of that \\"I'm deep and special and nobody understands the depth of my depthness and specialness\\" mentality that a book like \\"Catcher\\" can evoke.  Yet \\"Catcher\\" is a far better book than this piece and will deservedly outlast it in terms of influence and readability.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Perfect blend of Creep era and OK Computer....less noisy than recent releases.....the only CD I have enjoyed more in recent months was the new Vallejo Thicker Than Water CD, which I can't recomend enough! Can't wait to see the U.S. Tour
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Not all of us have seen it, but most everyone has heard about this film. It's influence has dictated policy not only in Washington, but globally as well. It is a well - made film, which takes a complex issue, and makes it easy to understand, with effective use of video, graphs, audio, and other techniques that maximize the subjective and recall of the human mind. Now, it may not have the technical innovations and obsessive perfection of Leni Reifesnshtal's famous film, but it does perhaps do a better job of creating a point of view than the The landmark documentary.  Trouble is, both are built on a foundation of lies. History has shown the lies of Triumph, but not even the frigid winter and empirical refutation of the statistics of this film can overcome the voracious desire to believe this is all true.         *****SIDE NOTE******    What is often overlooked is the story buried beneath the story, where Al Gore discusses his lonely childhood, who was whisked around the country according to the needs of his U.S. Senator father. Gore's stone face can't hide what appears to be a deep sense of feeling useless and inferior, of the sort that is so strong it can become the driving force  the driving force of  a person's life. Is it a coincidence that that child was motivated to grow up and surpass his father politically and monetarily? Could this environmental movement be a way to fill what must be a large, gaping wound at losing the presidency so closely. This would   be a great way to feel important again, and get even with those who failed to see his importance . . .

B0006L89N8|4.0|Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus is a highly popular book by John Gray and contains much to recommend it, especially for men and women in an intimate relationship.  It also may be valuable to anyone seeking to have a better understanding of the opposite sex.<br /><br />Personally I have some problems with the book which I should state up front. The first is that the cover lists the author as \\"John Gray, Ph.D.\\" I find that people who feel the need to list their academic credentials after their name (or otherwise boast about such achievements rather than let their ideas speak for themselves) are often more pedantic than informative.  Imagine for example:  Albert Einstein, Ph.D!  Secondly, Gray is riding a one-trick pony with this idea, having a series of books with this name, as well as a small business empire which he promotes in the book.  There are workshops, workplace seminars, counseling centers, etc. all devoted to Martians and Venusians.  Which brings me to my third objection, namely that the idea is just too cute.  Mars is a dry (probably), barren planet and Venus is covered with gasses. Why they are symbols for men and women is beyond me. I just can't take seriously such statements as \\"A man falling in love with a woman is similar to what took place when the first Martian discovered the Venusians.\\" (page 42) or the constant reference to men and women as \\"Martians\\" and \\"Venusians.\\"<br /><br />More significantly, Gray lumps all men and all women together creating more of a stereotype than real people. The sense is that all men and all women act in the way he describes. All men are from Mars--don't want to be improved (p.  162), argue for the right to be free (p. 134), solve problems alone (p. 27), etc. And all women are from Venus--get together and talk openly about their problems (p. 27), are like waves (p. 120), use poetic license to express their feelings (p. 61), etc. But all men are not alike, nor are all women.  Sometimes I like to talk openly with people about my problems, and engage in other behaviors that Gray attributes to women. I am sure that many women also act in ways that are supposed to be reserved for men. People are complex; Gray tries to simplify them too much.<br /><br />Having said all this, the book still is quite valuable. The following is a summary of some of the main points. Gray also provides numerous examples of how to respond and deal with problematic situations. The basic idea is that men and women communicate differently and should be aware of these differences. A man's sense of self is defined through his ability to achieve results. To offer a man unsolicited advice is to presume that he does not know what to do or can not do it on his own. Men want to be trusted to do the right thing. A women's sense of self is defined through her feelings and the quality of her relationships. Women want caring. Men should not offer solutions to women and women should not give unsolicited advice to men. When a man has a problem he goes inside himself to find a solution. When a woman has a problem she talks about it with others. When a woman is under stress she finds relief by expressing herself and being understood. A man under stress finds relief by solving the problem. Men like to feel needed, women like to feel cherished.<br /><br />Men take a win/lose approach (I win therefore you lose), women take a lose/win approach ( I lose so that you can win). A man's deepest fear is that he is not good enough, therefore he compensates by striving for success in material things. It is difficult for a man to listen to a woman when she is unhappy because he feels like a failure. Men and women mean different things even when they use the same words. Women express feelings, men give information. Men are literal, women are figurative.  Men are often silent rather than talking. Women have a hard time understanding this silence. Women talk to feel better and create intimacy.<br /><br />Men are like rubber bands--they move away and come back. Women should not chase after them. Women are like waves, they have emotional ups and downs. Men should not think it is their fault. Men want space to be free, women want understanding for the right to be upset. Men think that money will solve all problems. Women have both financial and emotional needs. Women need to receive:  caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation, reassurance. Men need to receive:  trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval, encouragement.<br /><br />The secret to empower a man is never to change or improve him. The best way to help a man grow is to let go of trying to change him. In an argument men fight (become aggressive) or flight (become silent) while women fake (pretend there is no problem) or fold (give in). Men do not say \\"I'm sorry\\" because it makes them seem to be wrong. Arguments escalate when a man invalidates a woman's feelings and she responds with disapproval. Men think that giving a woman a big present or kindness is more important than a small one. Women see all presents and acts of kindness as equal. Women need to learn to ask for support. The best way to do so is: be direct, be brief, use \\"would you\\" or \\"will you\\" phrases. Men are more willing to say yes when they have the freedom of saying no.<br /><br />I give the book four stars because it is useful and can help anyone understand themselves and have better relations with the opposite sex. Just don't believe every word.should not chase after them. Women are like waves, they have emotional ups and downs. Men should not think it is their fault.

B000MR9D5E|3.0|Saw preview on Oprah, had to have.  Was disappointed; fast forwarded thru a lot of sections, waiting for the \\"good stuff\\", and still haven't watched the last DVD of the set.  I watch a lot of nature and wildlife shows on public television, and because of that, \\"Planet Earth\\" simply does not provide a \\"WOW\\" factor for me.  There were also several \\"repeat\\" scenes about polar bears and penguins that I felt contributed to a waste of \\"space\\" where \\"new\\" scenes could have been provided.  It is a good DVD; but if you already watch a lot of nature/wildlife shows, there's really not much new on it.
B0012K1ILW|2.0|This is my opinion. Wow \\"E\\"--you owe me (and some 'us') an apology and I want that verbally and I want to understand it when you say it.      I don't want to be left scratching my head, crying uncontrollably or cursing like I got \\"Tourettes\\" because I am pissed off I bought this thang you call musik.    Let me say this...it is one thang to support your artist but sometimes enough--is uh DAMN NUFF!     There is always two sides to a situation with artist--you write the music you love and you write music for the fans who love you.  They evolve.  It's a beautiful thang.  You are suppose to love what you birth.    Unfortunately, evolution ain't (yep I sed ain't) alwayz a good thang.  Maybe it's a touch of insanity I don't know but I should have learned my lesson from \\"World Wide Underground\\".  I'm still blinking erratically off that mess and the doctors cain't (yep I sed cain't)--stop it.    I'm mentally scarred bcuz of it. I knew after that, what we would be in for when she's in one of her \\"SPACEBALL\\", incense, egg & candle cookin'---MOODS.     It is my belief that some (not all) of these 'high raters' are not being honest and are going strictly off the love for her only and not her work.  I respect that love but....    There is something to be said about a good combination of lyrics, meanings (messages) and beats to create masterpiece.      Ummmm...Twisted messages with No beats (or abscure beats) = \\"WHAT THA' F%$K IS THAT!\\" musik.  It doesn't equal good musik.    Just ask the lost fans of Prince, Purple Guy, Signature Man or whatever his name is (\\"The Forgotten One\\" is what I call him) and \\"NAS\\".  Trust me when I say...I love me some \\"NAS\\"...but his last two drops....litterally dropped.  Good messages, fresh lyrics but staaaannnnky beats.    This whole album is OFF BALANCE and selfish on her part and to think she has an \\"Amerykah PT 2\\"., \\"DownTown Lorreta Brown\\" and another (I can't think of the name)--coming back to back is really scary because I am betting those aswell will be....    Garbage for the lost soul.      As for the so-called only song that was liked by those of us who hated/disliked this album...\\"Honey\\"...it should be called...    \\"Erykah...Honey...STOP IT\\"...FUH REAL. You got a beautiful voice but..STOP IT!!!!!
006441034X|2.0|Sophie, the eldest of three sisters, is turned into an old woman by the Wicked Witch of the Waste, who is jealous of her abilities. She takes off and moves into Howl's moving castle. Howl is a magician, and his fire demon is managing to keep the castle in a number of places at the same time.<br />  The book was fairly well written, without any glaring failures in plot. The ending felt rushed, cluttered and it was the only time that I had to re-read sentences in order to keep up with what was happening. Overall, a fairly pleasant, but rather mindless experience. The characters were developed up to a point, but there was nothing really original here, just a lot of flippant remarks. The story had little depth to it, and it seemed that the author wanted to 'keep it light' in the sense of this is just a little fun story, don't take it seriously, wink-wink, let's have some tea now. But the humour wasn't worth more than a smile and the story, while not grating, was nothing more than the equivalent of bland tea on a breezy afternoon.

Michael Hall is superb. I love Six Feet Under but could not picture him in this role ... until I viewed it. The guy is brilliant and imagine ... TWO 5 star shows at such an age. Pure talent, hard work and then landing the correct roles.    Anyway, Season Two ... I'm thinking it will be like the first and wondered what plot would make another season. Could they do it again?    All I will say is that Season Two is even better ... much better and I still give Season One 5 stars.     SFU AND Dexter are on my Top Ten series ever produced. We could not wait for the next show after one had ended. Delightful yet dark, great cast, writing and everything else. Perfecto!

0151013047|2.0|The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid  This small book with large pretensions is thoroughly unsatisfying. The basic plot is conventional enough, to the point of triteness. A young Pakistani comes to America, experiences great success, falls in love with an unattainable troubled woman, decides that the American Dream is deeply flawed and corrupting, loses his love and returns, chastened, to his homeland. The supposed build-up of suspense to a shocking conclusion, the love story, the Pakistani and 9/11 backdrop, the world of high-finance, all strive to make this tale a little different. The tone is ambiguous from the outset, putting one in mind of LeCarre, even Rushdie, but Hamid is not worthy to tie the sandal the Master wears. The narrative method is an odd literary experiment, the whole 184 pages addressed directly by the narrator to his guest/nemesis/enemy/victim listener. The narrative breaks remind us that not only is the reader the audience, but the text itself has a listener, too. \\"What bad luck! The lights have gone. But why do you leap to your feet? Do not be alarmed, sir; as I mentioned before, fluctuations and blackouts are common in Pakistan. Really, you are overreacting; it is not yet so dark....\\" (60). If in Heart of Darkness every few pages Conrad had Marlow remind us that Marlow's story is being told after the fact, that Marlow has an audience within the book as well, the reader could not become so involved. Hamid's distancing, intended to build suspense, does not work, just as the story's conclusion does not work. The protagonist's reaching for the unattainable woman is much better told in An Equal Music, or Ground Beneath Her Feet. Erica the Firefly, the brief moment of fire in Changez's life is one of many jarring and heavy-handed symbolic touches. The prevailing mood is one of regret. \\"The ruins proclaim the building was beautiful\\", a Pakistani saying, is clearly meant to sum up all, the political subplot, the romance, the lives of all thekey characters. In the end, however, this building, this novel, is not beautiful, just ruins.
159562015X|5.0|I had been introduced to StrengthsFinder at a conference, and I decided to try it out since it was inexpensive.    What you're really paying for when buying this is a service that lets you take a test online. The information is simple to find, and in fact, the report repeats what is in the book for your top 5 themes. It is annoying that one has to buy a book instead of being able to directly pay online to take the test, but that does not detract from the quality of this service.    From my experience with the test, there were some suprises, and some things that just seemed obvious. While themes such as Analytical were expected, others such as Relator were more suprising, but never did the results of this sound completely out of line with my character/skills. If anything, it was interesting to think about how my choices and preferences came together into the themes.    I'd recommend this for anybody who has a general interest in determining what strengths that they can capitalize on AND is willing to devote about 30 minutes to taking a simple (although long) assessment. I would imagine that the report provided in StrengthsFinder is also useful for employers who have a vested interest in placing their employees in occupations which are best suited for them.    To summarize the perspective: Use and develop your strengths; don't waste time on the weaknesses - Too much time developing weaknesses is detrimental. You can only develop your weaknesses so far, and too much effort developing weaknesses weakens your strengths.

My own reveiw is differnt i liked this movie the camera put me that much closer to the 4 people and there seemingly endless stuggle to live. Ive seen most new horror movies and the classics to. Given that Cloverfield had me the edge of my seat more then any movie ive seen in years. The grittyness of the handheld camera,special effects and the sound blended together to make a awesome movie experince. I personally give this movie 4 stars and a must see
B000MRAAJW|5.0|I bought the series in HD_DVD. Of course I know about the recent history of HD-DVD but it doesn't matter to me. The program was excellent as far as I am concerned. It played beautifully on my HD player, all four discs. It seemed to cover about all the major categories of earth and was presented with good picture quality. Actually to me, it was probably more educational than entertaining. I saw many things that I did not know existed. I was impressed with the work of the cameramen. It is about 9 hours long but not the least bit boring. I feel that people of all ages will enjoy seeing this. I really recommend it in whatever format you choose.

In that way, over time, you will find it possible to make major changes in your life. All the kaizen references are a bit annoying, and, as another reviewer stated, the kaizen program is all about manufacturing and as such using kaizen in this way has no real relevance... however, despite that, a very good little book!
B000002TQV|5.0|In reading some of the reviews of this album I must say I am amused.  It seems like most people are trying to justify their greater love for this record over OK Computer.  Even more fascinating than that are the people completely bashing the band as a whole (a strong comment on their musical education and taste).     To address the first issue \\"Which album is better The Bends or OK Computer?\\"  Is this really a necessary debate?  They're both great albums, their completely different.  One of the things that makes Radiohead such a incredible ensemble is their evolution through the years.  They didn't just create a formula that worked and keep repeating it like most bands.  Every Album is a unique expression of art, and evolves and changes.      If I was really pressed to pick their greatest accomplishment I would probably pick OK Computer, just because it hits me on the deepest emotional level and because its so sophisticated.  Musically it is brilliant.  Personally, I think it is better to think of their best ALBUMS instead of album.  In that case I would say \\"The Bends\\" \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\" are their best recordings.  Kid A took the longest for me to appreciate, but when I did it was astounding.  I think people that love The Bends should stop trying to convince others to love it too.  Its an amazing achievement and if others dont love it its their loss.      For those who completely panned Radiohead as a band, I dont know what you're looking for musically and I really don't care.  You should go out and buy you're self a Michael Bolton CD, I am sure it will be right up you're alley.     All sarcasm aside.  For people who struggle with Radioheads later albums it is important to remember that Radiohead is art, not entertainment.  Its not always easy.  Thats what makes it so special.  While the rest of the commercial music industry is producing crap by the barrel full, Radiohead dares to create something risky and original.  And miraculously they have created something beautiful and moving.      So back to my title.  The Bends is the last great (somewhat traditional) rock album.  OK Computer breaks the barriers of genre and therefore it gets a little hazy calling it a \\"rock\\" albul.  The Bends was the last breath of life in a dying art form.  If you like music that is interesting and moving, buy The Bends.
159102594X|5.0|There are two things that made this novel a fantastic read:  1. The Characters: purposely stereotypical at first - northern barbarian, dashing young soldier, torturer, wise old wizard, etc..., their true natures are slowly revealed in a fast moving plot that will leave the reader amused, surprised, and sometimes horrified by what the characters say and do.  2. The Action: I cannot remember a more amazing, jaw-dropping combat sequence then the city spanning fight that occurs at the conclusion of the novel. And just when you think it is over, the author throws in one more hilariously horrifying little surprise.
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I found the movie quite good and the kids love it and watch it over and over. Well done Jerry.Barry
0792839749|3.0|I am 37 years old and never saw this movie growing up. Earlier this year we took a trip to Germany and the Bavarian Alps and toured the castle that is in this movie (the one featured on the cover). I believe this movie came out right before I was born. It was very entertaining. I recommend seeing it if you have never seen it or if it has been years since you last saw it.
0634022296|2.0|True to its title, it is just a chord book. Chords and lyrics, nothing else. I would have liked something that had some picking and strumming techniques as well, but I can't honestly say there is anything about the book or the way it was packaged that indicated it would be more. My only question is, why? Why bother putting out a book that is so sparse on content, when there are plenty of books out there with much much more. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one.

Adams hasn't rocked since Cuts Like A Knife and Monster was the last time I paid any attention to REM.  Until now.    This flat out rocks!

B00005JLEJ|5.0|Kagemusha is a great movie, and for my money it is more entertaining than  Ran. Kurosawa was trying to be too artsy in the latter film, which always puts me off just a little. Kagemusha tells the story in a more straightforward fashion, the acting is less exaggerated, and I think it's just more fun. However, what prompted me to review it was the visual quality, which I found a bit below what I'd expect from Criterion.    I saw the original shortened version in the theater when it was first released in USA. That was so long ago, memory won't allow me to compare with this Criterion DVD. However, the film, as noted by other reviewers, is a bit grainy. Nothing wrong with that. I like film grain, myself, as opposed to digitally smoothed visuals, which look less \\"organic\\" to me. The problem is that if you want to preserve accurately the whole visual character of the film, including the grain in the film, you need a lot of digital bits to do so. Kagemusha is three hours long. As a result, the average bitrate of the video on this DVD had to be shaved down somewhat. This leads to some \\"artifacts\\" of digital compression.     It is a small point, perhaps. But the lower bitrate does make the movie look slightly more grainy than it already is, due to digital compression. Perhaps you won't care, or even notice unless you watch on a high definition monitor, however the movie is not quite as sharp and clean as it could be.    My own preference would be for Criterion to have divided the movie in 2 parts on 2 DVDs, allowing the highest quality image possible. I don't think they quite achieved that goal with Kagemusha. Alternatively, Criterion could have applied more digital filtering to reduce the grain, and still put a three hour film on one disc.
0525950079|4.0|This was a great story, however, I could have done without the graphic sex references to women's anatomy.  I am so not a prude, but I felt that those references lowered the literary quality of the story--more like a bare breasted romance novel than the well-researched historical novel that it was.  In contrast, I just finished \\"The Painted Veil\\" by Somerset Maughn.  This was great literature with references to sexual encounters, but not quite so raunchy.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the greatest ever and I appreciated it at a great price.  The character development is so much better in this longer version than in the shorter (theater) version that came out a few years back. My entire family enjoyed it, including my husband.
B000CE9R26|4.0|Yes, some of the reviewers don't like every song. I can hear why.<br /><br />  She took the most chances after the Casablanca Years with Geffen Records. This was in the vein of The Wanderer (1980), also on Geffen.<br /><br />The following  tracks make this a must have:<br /><br />3) THERE GOES MY BABY (4:24) (122 BPM)<br /><br />4) SUZANNA (4:31) (129 BPM)<br /><br />5) CATS W/O CLAWS (4:23) (Oh, was Giorgio in the studio too???)<br /><br />6) OH BILLY PLEASE (4:56) (You know you have friends that would make<br />  this a complete production) (Or they have!)<br /><br />7) E  Y  E  S  (4:46)  (124 BPM) I LOVE THIS !!!!!<br /><br />10) FORGIVE ME (BALLAD)  (4:32) Super Sweet Summer :o)<br /><br />You just can't write a hit song everyday.  But Summer & Co. gave it their all folks.  PS: There is more than one listing for this disc, click the other CD available for a price much less than the almost $50 one found here.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|If the intent of this movie was to satisfy long term fans with a \\"wrap-up\\" of the final season, the producers/writers missed the target by a light year.  If you want a wrap-up of the season 10 story arc regarding the Ori, that's what you'll get.  However, that's about it.  I was vastly disappointed, finding the acting robotic, and the writing unimaginative at best.  Relationship issues were not addressed at all.  If you want to see what happened to Sam/Jack, or Daniel/Vala, don't waste your money - it's not even mentioned.  The whole plot felt rushed, as if the directors were trying to cram a hurriedly scripted ending into 1 hour of action - it can't and shouldn't be done.  Stargate was an amazing series, and had a great run.  I never thought I would say it, but maybe, just this time, they went one episode too far.
B000VUDSH6|4.0|The great, unbeatable, real life actionman Jackie Chan is ageing. This of course is not new or shocking information, but it is true. Therefore he has shifted focus a bit in his new film, \\"Robin B Hood\\" (for which the English name in China interestingly enough was 'Rob-B-Hood', which to my ears at least sounds a bit better). Although he still fights and leaps and such, it is no longer the main act. The comedy takes over, and I must say, quite succesfully.    There is one big problem with this though. While action and leaping around is universally understood, humour varies from one end of the world to another, and I think that there is a bit of that going on here. If you understand Chinese and Chinese culture and or cinema history, you will probably see more funny things in this film than if you don't. There are still plenty of things that are easily recognized as humourous, but many of the references and a lot of the dialogue is better if you speak Chinese. Nothing surprising about that really.    I think there are enough leaping and figthing (and a visit from Yuan Biao) to keep genre fans happy, and enough humour to keep anyone else satisfied. In short: I think it is a good film. Highly recommendable.
B000002IKR|5.0|This is a metal classic that still sounds fresh today. Saw these guys recently and they are even better now. Can't wait for the new CD to come out....8+ years is along time to wait!!!

0800141660|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I do not belive a better version of Sense and Sensability could be made. Everything is beautiful, the actors the landscapes the home decor the clothing the music. The acting is amazing (but not suprising from a cast that leads off with Emma Thompson). When I wear this out I will buy another!
B000OCXFCO|4.0|Finally the Megadeth I know is back! I had gotten away from metal for the most part, as the energy seems to have been pulled out of the genre. Once I heard this it reminded me of how great the genre can be....in fact I ordered the live Skinlab CD, SkinnedAlive that comes out the end of the month...it's about time they released a live CD, that's really their strength.

Do we know women who are in arranged marriages? Yes we do. Do we know women who didn't want those marriages? Yes we do. She tells her story honestly because she doesn't have anything to lose. She already lost her family and people.

B0010X745K|4.0|I watched this for the first time a couple weeks ago, and I have to say that I was thinking about the movie long after I had finished it. The Mist is the perfect examination of the rapid disintegration of civilization and humanity when faced with horrifying circumstances. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie or read the Stephen King story it's based on, The Mist concerns a group of people trapped in a supermarket while some otherworldly mist containing violent creatures swirls outside. But what is more terrifying than that are the happenings inside the store. Over a span of only (I believe) two days, the once-ordinary small-town folk degenerate into a bloodthirsty, pseudo-religious mob who sinks to the level of wanting to initiate human sacrifice to appease the monsters outside. Marcia Gay Harden does a brilliant job playing the ultra-religious Mrs. Carmody, who whips the group into a feeding frenzy. You just want to reach through the screen and slap her to shut her up, because you can see what she's doing to stir up turmoil. I don't care how many monsters you throw out there; I can't imagine anything scarier than a mob mentality. Thomas Jane is wonderful as David Drayton, an ordinary guy just trying to protect his son, but over the course of events he gets reluctantly thrust into a leadership role. The cast is truly brilliant here, so much so that individual accolades would take up too much time. Suffice it to say that this is a fascinating, genuinely terrifying horror film that, like any good horror film or story, makes you reflect upon yourself and what you would do if faced with similar circumstances. We all want to imagine ourselves as the hero, but, really, what would happen to our mindset and our grasp on humanity and doing the right thing were we faced with such a situation? I believe that question is truly unanwerable. To put it short, we don't know until we're in it. I would have given The Mist five stars but for one thing: the ending. I did not like it at all, and wish the director Darabont would have stuck with King's original ending in the written story. Without spoiling the ending too much, I'll say that King's original ending would have at least given the audience a glimmer of hope rather than the deeply disturbing conclusion Darabont gives us. Of course, it may be that perhaps in a true horror story, the good guy never wins. Whatever the case may be, if you enjoy a good horror movie that makes you think and sticks with you long after you've finished the movie, than The Mist is definitely for you.t all, and wish the director Darabont would have stuck with King's original ending in the written story.

B000UO7IM4|5.0|Brilliant collection from Monk's phase of collaborating (mostly) with Charlie Rouse in the form of a quartet, or playing solo, this small box contains a lot of brilliant music, original compositions and compact performances...<br /><br />Rouse was criticized by some for being to rigidly monkish in his execution, of having no individual voice, but to contribute to such magnificent art is by no means small achievement. He is no John Coltrane or Clark Terry, some of the giants Monk worked with on equall basis, but he was capable of digging into Monk's music. For crying out loud: even Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, in their famous album with Monk became an extension of Monk's mind (and, with Johnny Griffin on board, it was by no means one of the lesser line-ups of the Jazz Messengers).<br /><br />Monk plays beautifully throughout, giving some fresh songs, fresh recordings of his older gems and improvisations on standards.<br />For instance, on Solo Monk he plays \\"Dinah\\" and \\"These Foolish Things\\", on \\"Criss-Cross\\" he plays \\"Tea for Two\\", etc...<br /><br />For some variance (admittedly, these albums ARE similar in execution and the  line-up), the great modern vocalist Jon Hendricks has a glorious vocalising guest appearance on the album \\"Underground\\".<br /><br />Great collection, great general intro to Monk's work, great overview of a later stage of Monk's magnificent carreer, this collection is a great value for money...<br />BTW - on one of the albums the liner notes were written by the legendary baroness Pannonica...
B000LE16VW|4.0|Ghost starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg works because of the talented cast. The premise of the movie is a bit soapy but the acting is top-notch. Goldberg won an best supporting Oscar for her role as a wannabe pyschic, she's a hoot in this film. The chemistry between Swayze and Moore is sizzling, and I am rooting for a speedy recovery, get well soon Swayze! Ghost is the ultimate love story, check it out sometime.

B0001VTPWM|4.0|Remember when Robocop used to actually NOT look cheesy?  Times have really changed.  There's some really goofy things that happen in the movie that drag it down a *little* bit.    First of all, the very bad animation of that one SUPER robot that came into the picture to eliminate Robocop.  Did you see how fake that thing looked?  It walked like it was walking on sandpaper.  It was not believable in the slightest that this devastating robot was actually *right next* to the people in that one office.      I liked how Robocop stopped acting so much like a threatening robot as the movie went on.  He had some human emotions that weren't really noticeable until near the end of the movie, when he started saying \\"thank you\\" to that one woman who gave him baby food (yes, that's right- baby food).  There's probably a joke behind that, about a big scary machine robot eating baby food.    One thing I found really funny was how the bad guys outside on the streets were standing around destroying everything with these new updated and extremely powerful guns, and yet, despite all those men in the police station, not ONE of them ran out there to see what was going on, haha.    I think the biggest problem is that Robocop just doesn't look BAD enough anymore.  He's calm, he's got some protection from bullets, and he's able to walk forward in a quiet intimidating matter.  But... I don't know.      A decent movie at any rate.  Just some comical segments that are only funny because the movie doesn't hold up as well as it used to back in the late 80's when it came out.  Some of the fighting scenes are really intense, and when the human being that turns into Robocop dies in the beginning, it was surprisingly graphic watching his head blow apart.  I enjoy the movie at any rate.
0783219695|5.0|As I write this review on the anniversary of the launch of that fateful mission, I am reminded of how I felt during this tragedy. I was a teenager with an eye towards the sky. I had watched every launch I could since Mercury. Landing on the moon seemed so easy after Armstrong and Aldrin. It was hard to find out even when they would land let alone find coverage. We were all distracted by Vietnam. Little did I know, nor did anyone, that this, not the landing on the moon, would become, as Gene Kranz, the flight director, said, \\"NASA's finest hour.\\" This movie captures the mood of the time and the joy of that moment on April 17th when radio contact resumed after re-entry.<br /><br />This is an excellent ride, as one of the astronauts once said.<br /><br />Here's an interesting footnotes from Wikipedia:<br /><br />Grumman, the maker of the LEM (lunar excursion module) sent a bill for towing to the North American company, the maker of the command module. North American, jokingly declined, by saying that their accountants priced out a towing fee for the LEM for past missions to the moon. The LEM was the crew's lifeboat after the accident that crippled the command module.<br /><br />Ironically, stirring the O2 tanks may have prevented a worse tragedy. A level gauge failed early into the mission causing ground control to doubt a reading. So, the frequency of stirring the tanks was increased in the hope that the gauge would clear, i.e., function again, or that the cause of its failure could be determined. Increasing the frequency also upped the risk of failure of the heater. Based on normal stirring, the accident would have had a greater chance of failure later in the mission when there would have been less provisions to ration ¯ sometimes luck throws some English your way.<br /><br />If this review was helpful, please add your vote.
0124297854|5.0|Absolutely excellent book!!! but make sure you spend the extra money on the hard cover.  I bought the paperback and used it for a grad level total synthesis class and after two weeks the book completely fell apart.  I now have a very useful stack of papers instead of a very useful book.  I even emailed the publisher about it and got no response.  i would try and boycott the book but it's just too good to live without.  I recommend the hard cover instead.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|With all of the adjustments to the original story incorporated by the screenwriters, maybe the title should have been changed with this rendition just as it was with two earlier movie versions. My choice would be \\"He was Legend\\" based on the ending of the theatrical version. In the book the title highlights the irony of Neville's existence and demise, here it makes little sense.<br /><br />On individual merit, this version is worthwhile, bordering on above average in the genre of horror/zombie films, although in the original works the creatures pursuing - or alternatively pursued by - Robert Neville were vampires, and the movie's arguably cathartic, placebo of a conclusion is uninspired.  My difficulty is compartmentalizing the film and the book because knowledge of the source material rendered the film somewhat disappointing. While a few of the liberties or adaptations infused by the screenwriters are largely cosmetic, some can be attributed to the eras of the media as the novella was published in 1954. I did not find the change in locale from Los Angeles to NYC to be detracting even though it seemed to be a vehicle to substantiate an \\"Escape from New York\\" themed back story that is non-existent in the book. Altering the significance of the dog was a tender touch however I thought the role of the dog in the book conveyed Neville's conflicting senses of isolation and optimism much more effectively.  The introduction of the woman and the child to the movie, while in all likelihood unavoidable to tie this story together, unfortunately, resulted in a near complete loss of focus and direction.<br /><br />The adjustment in his occupation and experience may have been necessary within the constraints of film however Matheson's depiction of Neville as an average man forced by the vagaries of chance to carve out his daily existence was engrossing. Here, Will Smith's character is a physically fit, militarily trained scientist doing only what he knows best, continuing the research he started before the infection overran humankind.  The panoramic views of sites in and around Manhattan were an homage to the cinematographer and the CGI effects may have some enticing effect for some viewers but they could have easily have used those opportunities demonstrate why Neville became legend in the original story.<br /><br />I don't want to meander into the realm of spoiler, but there is a dichotomy in the book that fails to be addressed by the film.  One vehicle addresses competitive interests and survival while the other offers an idealized view of moral and ethical choice. Personally, the dystopian view holds more appeal for me.before the infection overran humankind.

B0006IIPIK|3.0|This film takes place in the same world as the adventure serials of the thirties that inspired George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. It even has the same feel as \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Indiana Jones\\" but nowhere near as good.    Huge robots are firing on New York City as they attempt to unearth the generators from below ground.  Six scientists have been kidnapped and a seventh is fearful he may be next.  Before he gets picked up he contacts reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) to tell her who he thinks is behind it and why. He thinks the man may be a missing scientist named Totenkopf. Totenkopf hasn't been seen or heard from since the war. Before he went missing he was rumored to be working on some kind of doomsday machine that would bring about the end of the world. Providing the terrified citizens protection from the air is Sky Captain a.k.a. Joe (Jude Law). Polly and Joe were once an item but the two broke up due to suspicious minds and sabotage.on  The old flames team up to track down Totenkopf and stop him before he destroys the world. Angelina Jolie (looking very sexy in an eye patch and tight leather and speaking in a British accent) plays Frankie Cook. Frankie runs a refueling station in the clouds. She is also a Commander in the British Air Force. Polly suspects Joe of cheating on her with Franky which leads to some friction when the two call on Frankie for help. Jolie's screen time is limited to just three scenes.  The rest of the film is carried by Law and Paltrow and it doesn't always work. Paltrow, though very attractive, is extremely grating as Polly. She is constantly screaming and shouting at Joe and the two lovers can never get along. Jude is no Harrison Ford and doesn't make for a very thrilling hero. The villains are more interesting  and that isn't saying much. Bai Ling is a robotic assassin who channels other films of the era by not talking. Totenkopf is \\"played\\" by Laurence Olivier. The director used old outtakes of the legend to create two scenes, played out in a hologram, that barely last three minutes. Interesting concept but it doesn't pay off. The reason to see the film is it's amazing visual scheme. It's fun and exciting for a little while but it all builds to a boring confrontation and  ends on a terrible joke.

The only thing I believe in is The Law Of Attraction. And I will share my secret with you - IT WORKS! This book changed my life, helped me achieve my dreams. And it still does. No matter who you are, where you are from, how old or young are you, take my advice - read this book and just allow yourself to believe in it. I truly wish it helps you as it helps me.

B000RZGFZC|3.0|Slayer is ok, I remember seasons in the abyss playing on headbangers ball and to me was no more better then when they played Overkill or Sepultura.  The songs to me that really are decent are tracks 3,4,5,7 and 10.  The rest of the songs to me are just thrash speed metal.  I can find lots of influences from other bands in these songs and their album-- but to me the group stands on line with Pentagram.  The riffs to me are nearly identical in tempo and style.  They talk about black obscure spooky things.  The lead singer is good and appreciate the way he expresses his voice in the songs mentioned.  The irish are tending to be masters of black realmed music beginning with Pentagram, Slayer, Tool.  But then again this is USA you cannot capture what you can let go.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Other disgruntled customers have complained about the shabby cardboard packaging of There Will Be Blood, but no one has mentioned, in this context, the considerable irony that the subject of the film (and Upton Sinclair's novel) is greed. The throw-away packaging has nothing to do with ecology (as one customer speculates charitably). It is all about maximizing profits. In landfills, cardboard lasts about as long as plastic, but it's cheaper.    Paramount and Miramax ought to a offer standard replacement case to anyone who bought the DVD. Distribution could be handled through sellers, such as Amazon.
B0010ZR160|5.0|Being a huge fan of Dennis Lehane and his Kenzie/Gennaro novels, I was anxious to see the movie adaptation of Gone Baby Gone.  I can't really separate the book and the movie, therefore I do take a bit away from the movie in comparison to the book.    First, the good.  I liked Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan as Patrick and Angie.  Although I pictured them to be a bit older, I thought the actors did a fine job.  The direction by Ben Affleck is wonderful.  The movie did a very good job in following the book, although it was like reading a Cliff's Notes version.    I only have two complaints.  First, Angie's character is almost non-existent.  She's a major player in the book, and much more than just Patrick's girlfriend.  Second, I was really hoping to see more of the unstable Bubba Rogowski.  He's another major character in the novel and the other novels as well.    My complaints aside, this is a terrific movie.  Exciting, gritty, and heart-breaking.  I highly recommend this film.

(Well I say so). On the Extreme Edition, disc #2 is just junk. Its so you can play it on your PC, & it plays it in \\"1080p HD\\", & to setup a Terminator game. Trust me, the game isnt that cool. Now, youll have to do alot of stuff, to get that up & running. Also, disc #2 has 18 mins or so of never before seen stuff. I say get the Extreme Edition cause of the picture quality & the Ultimate Edition cause the Ultimate Edition, has 2 discs packed with lots of special features that you can access on you DVD player.
080701429X|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for years and finally got around to it. WOW WOW WOW! That just about sums it up. The amount of thought provoking passages increased with each page. I was in tears several times. I've gone back and reread many sections that touched me. I think I'll read the entire book again very soon. There are already so many great in depth reviews here, so it's not necessary to go into detail. Just read it if you haven't yet! It'll make you count your blessings and give thanks.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|I have been watching this series episode by episode, and have been enjoying it very much.  I have visited the homes of John Adams and John Quincy Adams, and also read David McCullough's excellent book.  I look forward to owning it when it is released.  I just pre-ordered \\"The Adams Chronicles\\", the outstanding PBS minseries from 1976, and can't wait to get it.
B00139B39E|2.0|One must ask, why did they bother? As other reviewers have noted Dream Theaters songs definitely sit within the context of the album and even in the live atmosphere they are cleverly blended with past material to flow evenly from one to the other.    This album seems to have been compiled for a new audience rather than existing fans and as such is somewhat of a slap in the face. To proclaim this is the bands best work is ridiculous. What about such epic hits as Metropolis 1, Overture 1928, Lines in the sand, Trial of tears? Why has the Train of thought album generally been ignored once again? Surely Stream of Consciousness would have fit nicely between songs?    While I'm sure the remixes will strike a cord with a few people I would personally say don't bother. While Dream Theater put out an incredible number of live albums between albums, you are guaranteed to find plenty of interest capturing a snapshot of the band at the point of time of the album release. With these live albums you are at least treated to interesting compilations of songs coupled with exceptional solo spots and improvisation which provide far better value than a so called greatest hit album could ever achieve.
0670018651|5.0|You'll laugh out loud, you'll cry (especially if you've just bought a bottle that you have second thoughts about, only to find in this book your very doubts put into words like \\"third-world air freshner\\"... in other words, you will not be bored with this read!    If you are looking for a guide that provides the reader with a list of individual notes in each perfume, this isn't your book. Thank the gods, because as the reader discovers, such a list does not lead one to imagine with any accuracy the outcome of combining various notes.     Instead, Turin and Sanchez offer up for us the IMPRESSION left by various perfumes, mentioning unusual molecules and ingredients when noteworthy. In other words, they put into words what image/mood the wearer will deliver when wearing a particular perfume, and isn't that the point? For example, with efficient dispatch we, the reader, have no doubt of the lasting impression made by \\"Paris Hilton\\", or by Elizabeth Taylor's \\"Passion\\" reviewed in two words - \\"Fog Horn\\"... and by contrast, we are treated to a description of Dior's \\"Diorissimo\\" that truly helps a consumer/collector decide if this might be their one true love before purchasing a bottle - describing it (paraphrased) as just a bit shouty and yet radiant and uterly distinctive... and then there is Habanita's review which is a must read, evocative and paints a picture which sums up this perfume great in one image...    The book is organized not only by names of perfumes, but also with a very helpful sort by the rating given. Further, and for the first time in a direct and accurate way, this book addresses myths about wearing perfume, how to store it properly, to rub the wrists or not... and a host of essential tidbits for anyone wanting to protect their investment of the liquid inside those lovely little bottles.    Whether you are new to perfumes or a seasoned consumer, this book is indeed \\"The\\" Guide. Bravo to Turin and Sanchez!
B000IOM1YG|4.0|The remastering of Pyramid is nothing short of excellent. Of all the early Alan Parsons Project material Pyramid's sound quality was below par. It's sound lacked dynamics & clarity. That has been rectified with this new re-release.    Though Pyramid was not his best album it nonetheless has much to recommend. There aren't any hit singles from here, the Alan Parsons Project wasn't about hit singles. Parsons albums were thematic, the songs told the story of the particular album's theme. The early or classical Parsons period covers his first six albums. Pyramid peaked at #26 on the Billboard charts. Only Tales of Mystery & Imagination fared worse (#38). Of these six albums Pyramid is my third favorite album; I Robot & Eye in the Sky precede it.    In typical Parsons fashion the album opens with an instrumental, \\"Voyager\\". Parsons has a special knack for putting instrumentals together best described as 'ear candy'. Other instrumentals include \\"In the Lap of Gods\\" which is good & \\"Hyper-Gamma Spaces\\" which is excellent. \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again\\" is a beautiful ballad. It had the potential to be a single but the lyrics didn't have a strong hook, nevertheless, they are strong. \\"Can't Take It With You\\" is reminiscent of the Beatles with it's guitar riff, a highlight of the album. Only \\"Pyramania\\" drags the album down. Pyramid doesn't have the highs or quite the consistency of I Robot or Eye in the Sky but it's still a strong album.    The reissue of Pyramid contains seven bonus tracks. Being a musician I thoroughly enjoy hearing early versions of the songs included on the album. The demos are elaborate for what they are, all of them contain multi instruments but they are definitely demos. The booklet has some nice liner notes that gives information about the album & bonus tracks.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is delightfully fun and energetic.  The music is simply fantastic!  Although somewhat predictible at times, it definitely is a movie one could view multiple times and still leave feeling in awe of the story.  Robin Williams is such a multi-faceted talent - he did a wonderful job with the 'bad guy' Wizard character.  Freddie Highmore was a delight to watch - hope to see more of him.  Additionally, Jania Simone Nash was enjoyable - her singing was spirited and her character was true to her movie namesake 'Hope'.  A must see film.
0307394549|5.0|Martha Stewart et al have done it again. This is an absolutely mouth-watering book, full of beautiful photos and fabulous recipes. Everything is very clearly organized and well-written so that a novice can bake like a pro. Her instructions and tips are also wonderful for the not-so-new to baking as well. This book should be on every cook's shelf.

0440211727|3.0|John Grisham has established himself as one of the premier American writers in the recent past. Almost everything he writes is gobbled up devoured by his fans and rightfully so. He has a great knack for drawing you in to the characters and then like a punch in the nose..he hits you with the hook. Time to kill already is a classic and will remain on the reading list for high schooler and collegiates for quite a while.
B00004RJ74|3.0|woah -- 128 reviews?  this is insane!!  yeah, the cd rocks...but the only reason to buy the cd is song #13 - by tito & tarantula...\\"after dark\\"...the rest is just rock, not so extraordinary...and mostly found elsewhere.  but i suppose #13 is also...but if not, buying a cd for a gem like this could not be wrong... in any way....
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This soundtrack is charming, intelligent, energetic, and reminds me of the film (which I love). A single, simple piano song winds it's way though the movie. Sometimes played beautifully, sometimes not, sometimes grandly, sometimes quietly. My favorite scene in the movie is Kiera standing on a cliff with her eyes closed, just experiencing the breeze and the glory of nature. The song that plays during that scene (titled Liz on top of the world) is just brilliant. I can't imagine a nicer thing than a bubble bath, a glass of pinot, and this soundtrack soothing my jangled nerves.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I read the reviews but Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel - I bought the DVD.  Apart from the miscasting of Elizabeth (she is beautiful in the book) and Mary (either she can't act or was mis directed)- I enjoyed most of this version but the ending.....the running was insanity! It ruined the whole production! I could not recommend this, the last BBC version was much better, buy it instead.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Excellent movie. I first saw this movie in the theater. Afterwads bought the dvd. I was very satisfied with my purchase. Very heartwarming movie.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Short and sweet:  hands down the best production of anything I've seen since 1995's A&E TV production of 'Pride and Prejudice.'  The acting, music, story, costumes, everything - just top notch and unforgettable.  If you like quality storytelling and great literature, you'll enjoy this.
B000OCZD60|5.0|First rate transfer.  Video quality is outstanding.  Sound quality is adequate.  I'm a huge fan of Mad Max flicks and I only wish the first one would've been released on HD DVD.
B00104QSOM|5.0|I thought this would be your typical make it rich western oil movie.  I was so wrong.  At times, this movie has its slow spots, but that's for an eventual dramatic effect.  The acting in this movie was so above par.  Daniel Day Lewis deserved Best Actor, and I really believed that Paul Dano should have been given some sort of award other than a BAFTA nomination.  He has really developed as a serious actor stemming from his days in L.I.E. and Girl Next Door.  Because of this movie, we'll see good things from him.  I never really cared about how they got oil until I saw this movie, makes us wonder why we rely on the Middle East so much when we're sitting on so much oil.  I live in Michigan and we have a lot of unused oil here.    Get this movie if you know what's good for you.
B000MV9026|5.0|Arrived in time for Christmas as it was a gift.  Excellent play and condition
006135323X|2.0|I received this book as a gift. Would I have liked the book better if I purchased it myself? There is a chapter in Predictably Irrational that suggests that I would. Unfortunately, in my case, I don't think so. The first chapter was intriguing. The idea that humans judge on a relative basis rather than on absolutes was a notion I found fascinating. Unfortunately, the rest of the book was not as interesting. The remainder of the book seemed little more than anecdotes and personal feelings regarding human behavior that, in my view, most people already generally accept to be true. For example, I think most people recognize that the feeling of something being free is a lot different from the feeling of something being low cost. The book also seemed to be a thinly veiled vehicle to promote his views on the benefits of a more socialist society. At times, I was left scratching my head at the shortsightedness of the author's conclusions. For example, because human behavior is sometimes irrational, he suggests that government is needed to suppress this behavior, and to suppress \\"market norms\\" in favor of \\"social norms.\\" However, the author (irrationally?) forgets that government is made up of people, and elected by people, who are also irrational. Which group is more irrational: consumers or voters? There seemed to be little academic or logical rigor behind his conclusions. With some exceptions, his conclusions seem based mostly on anecdotes and informal experiments performed with academic friends & colleagues. In his discussion regarding the \\"high price of ownership,\\" the author exposes various irrational aspects of an ownership mentality. The author's conclusions, to me, are less convincing unless also expressing the irrational aspects of a more communal mentality otherwise it's simply rhetoric. If one explores why some value owning Duke Basketball tickets so irrationally, perhaps we also need to explore why most people pick up trash in their own yard but walk past litteron public streets, and why we we're apt to wash our own car before that of a rental.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|Okay, the three stars are for the cinematography, production design, and some of the acting.    Here are the flaws:   1.   the music is irritating and pervasive to the point of being a distraction.  We don't need to be manipulated with music; just tell the story.  2.  I assume Daniel Day-Lewis was doing the best he could with the \\"direction.\\"  The same goes for Paul Dano, though I found his preacher-man over the top at times.  The wonderful Ciaran Hinds (I think it was him) is wasted in a tiny role. The only one I enjoyed watching was the young boy playing H.W.  3.  the tracking shots and several other shots linger too long.  This is a common problem with directors who are so enamored of their own work that they cannot bear to clip out a single frame in the editing room.  4.  The last part of the film is bizarre.   The milkshake/bowling alley scene is unintentionally funny, and we have no idea what happened between 1911 and 1927.  How did Daniel deteriorate so much?  And the last scene just leaves us wondering how long he's going to sit on the bowling lanes with a dead body.  Rent it on cheapo day, but don't pay full price.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|Excellent.  Amazing video and music in a marvellous ancient place.  I love Lorenna McKennit music.
B000001GQP|3.0|I would like to clear up some confusion: THIS IS NOT THE RECORDED PERFORMANCE THAT CARL ORFF CONDONED!!  Orff attended the rehearsals of Eugen Jochum's earlier **1953** mono recording of Carmina Burana and approved that final performance.  That version is available on another DGG recording of all three pieces Orff wrote in a similar vein; the album is entitled \\"Trionfi\\".  The 1953 recording presents a very different version than this stereo one that Jochum recorded 15 years later in 1968 AND WHICH ORFF DID NOT HEAR!!  The earlier version is grittier, perhaps not as smoothly played or expertly sung, but altogether more primal and exciting.  The early mono sound of that 1953 version is very good, easily  the equal of the stereo sound except for the sound-stage, and the performance is far superior.  This later one is sluggish by comparison.    If you want to hear how Orff wanted this piece to sound, buy the \\"Trionfi\\" album and enjoy it.  Orff certainly did!
B000J233SK|5.0|Amazing music, excellent artist.  I love Lorenna McKennit music, and this disc is one of her best ones.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Very nicely packaged, sound and picture quality were excellent.  John Cleese's interview segments were a tad rambling, and the outtakes feature wasn't nearly long enough.  \\"Fawlty Towers\\" (or \\"Fatty Owls\\", \\"Farty Towels\\", \\"Flay Otters\\"...read the sign out front at the start of each episode) was wonderful in its time and it's wonderful now.  Basil Fawlty, it turns out, was based on a real hotelier -- imagine paying good money to go to a seaside resort and then being verbally abused by a hotel owner who loved the business, but hated people!  Ole Basil wasn't as far off the mark as he seemed!
0879309210|5.0|This is an excellent book. It covers basic to advanced information on a repair as well as great explanations on how to do the repair. I have repaired guitars for years, but had gone away from it for a while. This was a great refresher on some measurements and fine points I had forgotten the specifics of.
0618918248|1.0|For reasons of space, I shall pass over the routine recital, now given in hundreds of the reviews, of most of the points in Dawkins' book The God Delusion, and concentrate my review on one point only, which he deals with on pages 339,340.  His position is, unambiguously, that there cannot be any such thing as `human' ethics or morality, and he tells us why:  there is no real, meaningful distinction between a human being and a brute beast.  I am astonished that this passage is not more frequently commented on.<br /><br />Dawkins simply ignores the critical issue of human rationality. Flying in the face of all the evidence, he assumes (I insist, he assumes, he does not prove) that Homo sapiens, absolutely like every other form of life on earth, is simply a bundle of cells.  He says (p. 340):  \\"The evolutionary point is very simple.  The humanness (italicised) of an embryo's cells cannot confer upon it any absolutely discontinuous moral status.\\"  I must underline what Dawkins is saying.  He is not saying that man is `like' the brute beast in some ways ('Intelligent Design' authors like Antony Latham, Alister McGrath and Michael Behe who attack Dawkins' atheism have no difficulty in accepting common descent, shared cellular similarities with the rest of creation, in varying degrees).  He is saying that man is `no more than' a brute beast in any way, is no more than a collection of cells.<br /><br />Dawkins explicitly rejects the idea that any moral consideration can apply to humans simply as humans. He rejects the idea that there is anything that clearly separates human beings from non-human animals. This follows from his view that limits everything to pure Darwinian evolution of matter from matter.  He believes in the evolution of the non-human animal into the human animal, body, mind, 'spirit', 'soul', religion, science, and all.  He tells us (p. 339):  \\"Notice now that 'pro-life' doesn't exactly mean pro-life ('life' is italicised) at all.  It means pro-human('human'is italicised)-life.\\"  Of necessity this must mean that he views all merely brute animal life as equal with human life.<br /><br />Notice the monstrous conclusion that follows from this.  It destroys any possibility that Dawkins' version of Darwinism can be right.  \\"The granting of uniquely special rights to cells of the species 'Homo sapiens' is hard to reconcile with the fact of evolution\\" (p. 339).  I repeat this:  \\"The granting of uniquely special rights to cells of the species 'Homo sapiens' is hard to reconcile with the fact of evolution.\\"  I conclude:  It is not only hard, it is impossible (which is what Dawkins clearly means us to understand).  And therefore, for me, on the grounds of the evidence provided to any observer (even a Darwinian observer) that Homo sapiens and the brute beast are not the same, Dawkins' 'fact of evolution' must be abandoned.  I see no alternative to this.  Dawkins is utterly indefensible here.  But his arrogance blinds him to the absurdity of his own position, for he goes on immediately:  \\"Admittedly, this [irreconcilability between the pro-lifers and the Darwinists] will not worry those many anti-abortionists who don't understand that evolution is a fact!\\" (Dawkins is responsible for the exclamation mark.)  Dawkins has just proved, to my satisfaction, that 'the fact of evolution' cannot be a 'fact' because of the manifest monstrousness of the conclusion that he sees as necessarily following from his position.  Surely the idea that a human being is fully and exhaustively defined by its having \\"cells of the species 'Homo sapiens' \\", to use Dawkins' own words, in exactly the same way as any other living organism is fully and exhaustively defined by its having cells of its own species, is an intolerable assumption that, I repeat, will not stand one moment's observation of the world about us.  This Dawkinsism must be exploded for the absurdity that it is.<br /><br />Dawkins takes as proved (but doesn't prove) the existence of 'intermediate species' (Dawkins' words) between man and any brute beast you care to name.  So Dawkins asks the question: \\"Would these [intermediate] creatures 'count as human' or not?\\" Dawkins replies (p. 340) that only 'absolutists' \\"must answer the question, in order to apply the moral principle of granting humans unique and special status because they are human\\" (Dawkins puts the last four words in italics (p.340). Dawkins scorns this 'absolutist' position.  He says:  \\"To a consequentialist like me, the question doesn't deserve an answer, for nothing turns on it.\\"  Can Dawkins be really aware of what he is saying?  He tells us that it doesn't matter if we are humans or brute beasts, \\"for nothing turns on it\\".  Once again, this must be exploded for the absurdity that it is.<br /><br />He goes on (p.340): \\"Even if a clear answer [as to whether a living being is a human or a brute beast] might be attempted for Australopithecus, the gradual continuity that is an inescapable feature of biological evolution [another glib assumption of Dawkins that he doesn't prove] tells us that there must be some intermediate who would lie sufficiently close to the 'borderline' to blur the moral principle and destroy its absoluteness. A better way to say this is that there are no natural borderlines in evolution. The illusion of a borderline is created by the fact that the evolutionary intermediates happen to be extinct. Of course, it could be argued that humans are more capable of, for example, suffering than other species. This could well be true, and we might legitimately give humans special status by virtue of it.\\" (Understand what Dawkins is saying: the only reason that he can find for granting human beings any 'unique and special status' 'because they are human', is that the human may be more conscious of suffering than the brute beast.  Dawkins continues: \\"But evolutionary continuity shows that there is no absolute (in italics) distinction.\\"  Yet again, an absurdity to be addressed andcondemned.<br /><br />Understand again what Dawkins is saying: There is no absolute distinction between human beings and brute beasts - or any other of the now-lost 'intermediate species'.  He goes on: \\"Absolutist moral discrimination is devastatingly undermined by the fact of evolution.  [I riposte:  Exactly the opposite statement is true:  'The fact of evolution is devastatingly undermined by absolutist moral discrimination'.] An uneasy awareness of this fact might, indeed, underlie one of the main motives creationists have for opposing evolution: they fear what they believe to be its moral consequences. They are wrong to do so\\" [Are they really? Am I then free to judge Dawkins the same way that I judge a brute beast? Does Dawkins accept that it is acceptable for a human being to be a carnivore?  Where do I draw the line in my choice of meat meals?]  \\"but\\", Dawkins goes on, \\"in any case, it is surely very odd to think that a truth about the real world can be reversed by considerations of what would be morally desirable.\\" Really?  This is intolerable reasoning.  It is not odd, it is essential, that what is 'morally desirable' must rule the world.  Law and order would collapse otherwise. Murder and lying and stealing and adultery are 'truths about the real world'. Morality is a truth of the real world. Without 'morally desirable' judgments, which Dawkins' Darwinism considers to be impossible, the quiet world of scholarship (and even scholarship is impossible as a strict Darwinian evolution from matter) that Dawkins inhabits would collapse into sheer barbarism, '(human) nature red in tooth and claw'. Dawkins' philosophical ramblings here are simply derisory.<br /><br />Ruse and Wilson, `respected giants in this field' of moral philosophy and science, find it \\"easy to conceive of an alien intelligent species evolving rules its members consider highly moral but which are repugnant to human beings, such as cannibalism, incest, the love of darkness and decay, parricideand the eating of faeces ... \\" (quoted in Latham's The Naked Emperor, pp, 154,155). Dawkins' reasoning above forces him to accept such a scenario as unobjectionable morally for us humans now.
B000024D4R|5.0|In 'Animals' Pink Floyd supposedly went in a little different direction compared to their other works. The music in this album is less spacey and atmospheric, and is harder than most of their other albums. This goes with the fact that all five songs in this album have lyrics. While this album is less experimental compared to many other PF work, it is still quite innovative. I agree with many of the reviewers here that this is one of their finest work, although unfortunately, it's not as well known as, say, DSOTM. What most people hardly point out though, are the first and last songs from this album (Pigs on the Wing, part 1 and 2). These two songs are short, a little over a minute in length, and they are very different from the rest of this album. Strange as it may sound, these two are actually love songs. That's right, love songs. Strange, because I don't know many PF songs that are about love. Well, both of these songs are just amazing, and while many people don't care much about them, I would rate them among PF's best songs. Six lines of lyrics and pure magic.    The rest of the album includes the three songs in the middle - Dogs, Pigs and Sheep. These are very different from the two songs mentioned earlier. Very negative and bleak, these three songs are metaphorical, drawing parallels to the society. And yes, they are long - 'Dogs' is the longest at over 17 mins. I personally like 'Dogs' best among the three, but all of them are really great.    An extraordinary album. If you want to venture outside the more well-known PF work, listen to this one.
B00132D808|5.0|I did not consider myself a Panic fan...until this album! This is probably one of the best albums I have heard in a very long time. The songs are fun and catchy and if you can resist singing along, then there must be something wrong with you! What really made this album such a great comeback album is the new predominant use of instrumentals that wasn't there before. Each song is so unique because the instruments play such a big role in making the sound. The vocals are great and this time Ryan is singing along too! His voice really complement's Brendan's. The lyrics are also really fun and at times even amusing. All I have to say is that I have been listening to this album for the last week and it hasn't gotten old. The songs are pretty mellow, but they are also great to rock out to so it's a nice medium of sounds. And the album's name does it justice, in a good way. The lyrics are pretty odd and the songs are about sort of random things; it has a kind of fairytale feel to it that's really cool! I didn't even buy this for myself and now I find myself only wanting to listen to this one album! I definitely recommend listening to this even if you were not a Panic fan before and definitely if you are a Panic fan! They have really matured musically...their new sound is awesome! This album deserves an A+++!
0810994739|5.0|School's starting again and Greg, Rodrick's younger brother (a.k.a., The Wimpy Kid) is starting his journal. You can't call it a diary because that's `girlie.    Greg, through his alter ego, a.k.a. author Jeff Kinney, is following up his New York Times Best Selling Diary of a Wimpy Kid with a story where his brother \\"rules.\\" Created on wide lined paper with cartoon drawings throughout (some handsome; some not-so handsome, and the weird ones are easy to pick out).    This book has many possible markets: boys in this pre-teen age, their parents, men who want to reminisce how thrilled they are to have made it through junior high--and anyone else who wants to laugh out loud at the antics of this wimpy kid (your little brother, maybe?) Everyone who attended school can relate to him, some of us more so.    Before school journaling starts, Greg has to recount his summer, his friends and enemies--and he has lots of them. But then the first day of school starts with Greg's biggest fear is that the stupid thing he did in summer that ONLY brother Rodrick knows about, will be spread around school--the kiss of death.    Here are some of the common themes that I am sure are played out in families worldwide, as our siblings toughen us up for surviving life:    * Older siblings that taunt and blackmail you, and young ones who tell on you.  * Name calling and ugly nicknames.  * Older sibling's poor educational reputation passes down to you.  * Praying for school to be cancelled by weather because you don't have your report done.  * Dad/Mom `helping' with a report so you get a good grade--and maybe better than they ever got.  * Stupid things boys say/do that other boys think is cool-and girls hate.  * Your worst fear coming true, or not being as bad as you thought.    Near the end (p. 211) the book says, \\"So that just proves once and for all that Mom doesn't understand a THING about kids my age.\\" Boy, isn't that the truth!    From the cover to the last page, author/cartoonist Kinneyhas captured our families and given us some deep and joyful laughs (especially if we and our kids survived that time). Kinney is an online game developer and designer when he isn't Greg's alter ego.    Armchair Interview says: Kids of all ages will enjoy this. Read the first book, too, and anticipate Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw.
0810994739|4.0|That he is. But he is funny and recognizable. The shock of the familiar may actually hit home with some kids. Just don't expect our hero to be a role model.
B00102FELM|3.0|I'm not a Mathias fan, so I won't comment on that. It was nice to see the Scorpions w/ some faces from the past. Uli was on as usual, but I felt bad that Michael seemed so unrehearsed & uninspired. If you're looking for Michael to blaze some Scorpions songs, you might be disappointed...    A couple things to add after owning this for a while:    1. Yes, the video editor should be shot...  2. The tunes are a bit rushed. The Scorp's have a bad habit of that...  3. The sound has that loud broadcast mastering sound to it, where everything is always loud. No dynamics...    Kind of a disappointment overall...

B000PKG6TE|3.0|Sincerely I expected a longer live for QOTSA, when I get \\"Rated R\\" and \\"songs for the deaf\\" I  was pretty sure to have a large romance with this band, however it seems Homme doesnt give a damn in letting go very valuable musicians, Hernandez first, and then Oliveri, QOTSA is his band and he doesnt share the control of it with no one, this is very bad if you want to make a name as a band, otherwise you better become a solo artist and no problem, Now I have to point at the good stuff in \\"Era Vulgaris\\" I absolutelly looooove, \\"Into the hollow\\" and \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" other songs like \\"Battery Acid\\" , \\"3's & 7's\\" and \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" are amazing as garage rock cuts, but I have to insist, this is a Josh Homme solo album, the intellectual and creative other half that Oliveri provided to the first three QOTSA albums is gone since \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" and because of this the last two albums of the \\"band\\" are missing the incredible variation we used to enjoy in prior recordings.

0525948023|5.0|Reading this book has moved me from fearful to fantastic.  There was a shift in my way of thinking of my world.  It caused me to be in action around the things I set out to accomplish.  I have gotten more accomplished in the breakthrough moments I have experienced from reading this book and putting the lessons into action.  I am able to see the things in my life that prevents me from accomplishing my goals and dreams to one of realizing my goals and dreams.
B0014BEDBQ|5.0|Believe it or not, I'd never heard an entire Justin Timberlake song until a couple of months ago. My sister loves him, so I decided to buy his dvds for her. My mistake was watching them first. I was so easily sucked in! Now I have to buy another copy of this dvd, so I can keep this one. It's the 4th one I've bought her (2 concerts & 2 music videos), and my favorite so far. It's the only one that hasn't been censored (I sought this unedited version purposely). There's a full length concert, and not just a few songs, like on \\"Live From London\\". As mentioned, there's an intro and outro with Justin and crew that gives interesting insight on their tour and relationship.    I'm not very familiar with Madison Square Garden as a venue, but it seems to change every time I see it. I like the effects, especially the netting that is used as a projection screen. I appreciated the fact (as a woman) that the dancers weren't emaciated and looked healthy and sexy. All of the back-up singers and musicians were wonderful, and you could tell that everyone enjoyed touring together and had a good relationship. Of course Justin shows some smooth moves, and Timbaland joins in on some songs. To me everything seemed just right. Not the best concert I've ever seen in my life, but highly enjoyable and worth purchasing and re-watching!    P.S. - I guess it's really a collection of 5 dvds now, including his Dec 2006 Saturday Night Live appearance. Darn good show, and \\"Box\\" is definitely a catchy tune!
1891252089|5.0|It's an amazing book which is also very very user-friendly. Besides clear explanations of all the terminology such as \\"Ashtanga\\", \\"Bandhas\\" and so on, it's equipped with a spiral binding and a hard cover so that you could read/ watch it by practice the movements. In addition, it will teach a series movements instead of separate movements (like some Yoga books do) so that you could have an idea of the whole \\"flow\\" of the movements. It's very useful and practical. I would strongly recommend this book to whoever wants to learn this amazing Ashtanga Yoga.
B0014BDP88|3.0|A beautifully shot movie that lacks substance and even summarizes itself in a Norah Jones song at the end - \\"The Story.\\" The story has indeed been told before, but never with some much vivid color and magnificent scenery. Natalie Portman looks spectacular and David Strathairn delivers a great performance. Norah Jones sounds incredible on the soundtrack and acts quite respectably, particularly in the company of her famous cast. Still, the movie's zooming in and out technique and the constant shifting of focus is more distracting than helpful. Elizabeth (Norah Jones) might be going on a self-reinvention tour through United States, but the movie stands still without proving much of anything.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I admit it, I have all of Britney's albums. I have to say by far this is her best. It is so upbeat, it makes me dance and I hate dancing. Break the Ice is definately my favorite track on the album, it's got a great beat.  If you loved the earlier old school Britney, I think you will definately like this album. She has made her comeback, I can't wait for the next album!

B00065MDRW|5.0|..... the most important progressive rock album ever recorded. Truly, an astonishing piece of music, that led the way for many others in the progressive genre.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This music is definitely inspired. I have performed Under Your Spell for my mom and she loved it...It's the only episode that I can get my whole family to watch because we all love music. Anthony's voice is to die for in this music! Listen to the part in Walk Through the Fire where he first comes in, his voice goes really low and it gives me shivers...by the way, if you like his voice, check out the cd Music For Elevators, it's all him singing...and it even includes a song that Joss Whedon wrote and orginally wanted in the musical, but it never made it. The song's called Last Time. Hope you like it!
B000OQF6N6|2.0|I didn't like this album at all.  I was really looking forward to it because I loved Billy and Smashing Pumpkins growing up and through college but this album never grew on me.  Maybe I'm just getting old and I'm not as into something this heavy. The album was much heavier than I thought it would be. I always liked the Pumpkins' mellow songs the most and this certainly didn't have much of that.    Matt Zarnstorff
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I'm a big Radiohead fan, and I absolutely love this album.  It may only have 10 tracks but considering the cost of the album its well worth it.  I enjoy them all, with over half being very good songs.  I also love how they introduced the album with a \\"pay what you want\\" download.  Great idea.  Thumbs up for In Rainbows

0060558121|3.0|The characters in this book are entirely an afterthought to the setting of the book. A lot of interesting ideas come together in a so-so way, but it takes the reader too long to get there. This probably should have been a graphic novel instead.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|First off, let me just say I know nothing at all about the Final Fantasy series (although I did see \\"Spirits Within\\") and hate anime. In all fairness, that could be exactly why I thought this movie was such sweet sauce. I'm sure the die-hard fans believe the film did an injustice to the franchise.<br /><br />Watching this flick is the equivallent of watching some really hot chick dance at the bar. You just can't look away.<br /><br />The CGI is absolutely the best I have ever seen in a movie or on a video game. The creators must have put countless hours in perfecting every detail down to the characters hair. I mean I'm talking serious perfection here, when the wind blows you can see individual hairs on the characters' head move in the breeze. Flippin' amazing.<br /><br />One of the complaints I've heard is the lack of a cohesive plot. I never felt lost and I can't think of one animated movie I've ever seen expecting a compelling and complex plotline. What I do hope for is to see a flick that is mindless entertainment. That is where \\"Advent Children\\" more then succeeds.<br /><br />I assure you, coming from someone who knows nothing regarding Final Fantasy and dislikes anime, this flick will rock your socks.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|SG1 fans, the back cover of the DVD says it all. It \\"...picks up where Stargate SG-1 left off...\\" What happened after that Ori killing bomb was sent through the Super Gate? \\"The Ark of Truth\\" answers the question. I won't answer it for you. Doesn't really introduce anything new and closes (?) a few story arks. Glad I've added it to my collection.
B00005JPOO|5.0|unless it comes out in a director's cut. There is so much more I want to see of the Christina Ricci and James McAvoy characters before she reveals herself to him (no character names for a reason - see the film). I *KNOW* there's got to be more that, for some bizarre reason, got left on the cutting room floor. You still feel it with what's there... but there's more. Admit it! Please! A director's cut and ONLY a director's cut!!! C'mon! Have a heart!!!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|saw this on tv thought it ended the sg1 series fairly well . the only dissapointment was the scenes with the replicators. i thought it wasnt neccessary to include them into the movie after all this was supposed to put an end to the ori story. anyway, id recommend this movie if you are a stargate fan . i also thought more could have been added to the storyline regarding the ori but all in all its not a bad story
B00139W3NE|1.0|This is a perfect example of inept film making at its worst and the blame has to lie at the feet of the Director. He obviously has no experience directing Actors and the sorry performances attest to it. I could not believe that this wealth of acting talent could uniformly deliver such appalling performances. From Tom Courernay to Nicole Kidman the acting is terrible.     The worst performances, if that is possible, are by the child cast. Dakota Blue Richards is a very bad actor. Period.    This type of mess is typical of what Hollywood has been producing since the new millennium and is the main reason that less DVDs are sold and less people go to the cinema. It is not because of file sharing or pirate DVDs, it is because the product produced by Hollywood is of such an low standard that people are finding or making their own entertainment.    This is proof that the people in charge at the Hollywood studios are ignorant and out of step with what the public wants. They need to be replaced by artists or else Hollywood dead, if it is not already.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|While I thought the movie was going to filled with action and blood, it really is a story of compassion and love. Beowulf brings a sense to the movie of having a heart where others see him differently. I found it to be a movie that we have seen over and over again but, created with a beauty and understanding of being different. Great job!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the Best shows I have ever seen. It has a lot of values and personal conflicts reflected in each of the characters, and it shows. A television show with some morals...go figure. In this day and age, it really was nice to watch something worthwhile, and it is a tragedy that it was not continued past the first season. Cudos Joss Whedon! They cut this show just when it was ready to break out and that is truly a loss for everyone. I recommend this compared to ANYTHING being made today, and the difference is that this was a Family of misfits who learned to get along and trust, help, and love one another as humans should and even to sacrifice for for each other when necessary. I Love This Show....
B00009P1O2|5.0|Awesome sound and video. Freddie Mercury has proven why he and Queen were the best. Freddie is such a showman that you cannot take your eyes off of him or you are afraid you'll miss something! What a voice range! The greatest voice that Rock ever knew.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|SHINEY! A continuation to the Firefly series, this movie closes out the show and has a lot of gusto in doing so. A must have for any Fan of the series and the explanation of what the Reavers are and where they came from. Very well made without the swearin', cursin', or Godlessness of most Sci-Fi movies. Add to your collection. 'nough said....
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Tremonti's guitar playing has gotten so much better with each Alter Bridge Album.  He really has raised the bar.  One of the most improved and innovative guitar players nowadays.  Every song is good, and that's what really matters.  Miles Kennedy has a great soaring voice and also lends his talents to the new Sevendust CD Chapter 7 in one of there songs.  Pretty cool.  Keep on rockin

B00000G3AZ|4.0|It's been said that for two weeks every year, the countryside of England is the closest Earth comes to Eden.     That is the England of Douglas McGrath's 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen's novel, \\"Emma.\\"  Starring Gwyneth Paltrow (pre-\\"Shakespeare in Love\\") and a host of British acting aces, \\"Emma\\" is a pure feel-good romp through England's strict Victorian manners.      Emma Wodehouse is living her life by arranging the lives of others, content to try to arrange the marriages of the Harriet Smiths (Toni Collette) of the world to the Mr. Eltons (Alan Cumming).  Romantic misadventures abound, particularly when the dashing Mr. Churchill (Ewan MacGregor) shows up and the equally dashing Mr. Knightley (Jeremy Notham) begins to look like something a bit more than a best friend.    McGrath keeps all this romantic folderol clipping along at a blithe, cheery pace, complete with pitch-perfect soundtrack and gorgeous camera work.  But perhaps the most moving scene is where Emma bares her claws and tears into a ridiculously chatty friend (played perfectly by Sophie Thompson) only to have Mr. Knightley call Emma out.  This is the prototypically Jane Austen scene - the exactly right words say so much with subtext even though they aren't that damning at first light.  To say the actors handle this scene well is an understatement.    Perhaps I should give this movie five stars.  It's tough to do so - both the Jane Austen filmography and the spate of terrific English romantic comedies are crowded fields.  While I can't say \\"Emma\\" is the best film I've seen, it is surely one of the most enjoyable, smile-inducing flicks I've watched in a long time.  A sure-fire winner.
1569242739|5.0|I was a strict vegan for many years, now an omnivore.  But I still prefer to bake like a vegan--not so much for health reasons, but I find it easier, challenging and fun at the same time. I borrowed the book from the library to try it, and will definitely be purchasing it for myself.    So far we've made the Vanilla Cupcakes with Fluffy Vanilla Buttercream, and the Cookies and Cream Cupcakes...both way better than any non-vegan cupcake I've made in my life!      The buttercream frosting recipe alone is worth the price of the book.  It's the first time i've made perfect, spreadable, delicious buttercream frosting.  And the chocolate cupcake recipe is divine, and as the authors suggested, I'll be making those without frosting for quick little chocolate cakes.      The authors' troubleshooting suggestions are helpful too; it had been a long time since i'd attempted cupcakes, but I felt confident when following their advice.  A well-done, fun, cute book, with fantastic recipes.
006112429X|3.0|Maybe it's my position as a school teacher that made this novel disturbing to me.  I felt as though I was watching a slow train wreck before my eyes through the novel.  I did not enjoy this novel.  Kevin and the family portrayed in the novel should have been in counseling way before Kevin commits his crime.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Great Movie! I am a huge fan of all stargate movies and series. I really  hope that more will be made.
B001437DMA|5.0|I have read all the reviews and believe with Satch his music is a different experience for all.  I have everything except maybe some strange expensive imports.  I have really listened to this extensively before giving a review.  I do not have the one song from itunes so just for the 10 songs the best to me is Andalusia.   Following that would be almost every song just a small amount less as incredible than Andalusia.  Personally it his best he has put out since Crystal Planet.  There are many reviews which say dislikes about I Just Wanna Rock and that is baffling the song is a very good song with a sizzling solo.  I wish I could understand why people think it is not up to par b/c I believe this purchase is a great Satch buy with a big variety to choose and to lead up to Andalusia, Asik Vaysel works perfect.  I think Joe can play so well and fluid that it is hard to reconize how difficult or intricte his playing is to accomplish.  Coming from 20 years of listening and enjoying Satch this disc is up there at the top.
B000002I2I|4.0|The Doors organist Ray Manzerak has said that Morrison Hotel (1970) was his favorite of all of The Doors' albums. Why? \\"Rock n' Roll!\\", he said. It's the closest they ever came to a pure rock or blues-rock album. Sure, they had done blues (Back Door Man) before and were always a rock band, but their main focus had always been on theatrics and darkly sensual rock poetics. On Morrison Hotel, Robbie Krieger's electric guitar leads the way while the tinkling avant-garde English organ passages of the past give way to a bluesy Hammond B-3 organ sound. The Lizard King isn't much interested in poetry or theatrics now, he's ready to party and rock n' roll!<br /><br />Roadhouse Blues opens the album, and right from the start you know you're in for a rocking good time. The song rocks harder than anything The Doors would ever do, and the wildly manic Morrison rips it up good.<br /><br />Well I woke up this morning and I got myself a beer<br />The future's uncertain and the end is always near.<br />Let it roll, baby, roll<br />Let it roll...<br />All night long<br /><br /> Waiting For The Sun, the unreleased title track from their third album is a classic. A mixture of spacy poetic longing and commanding electric rock, Morrison is melodious and vivid.<br /><br />At first flash of eden<br />We race down to the sea<br />Standing there on freedom's shore<br />Waiting for the sun<br /><br />You Make Me Real acknowledges identity validation from a lover.<br /><br />You make me real<br />You make me feel what lovers feel<br />You make me throw away mistaken misery<br />You make me feel love, make me free<br /><br />The strong and funky rocking Peace Frog was taken from two separate Jim Morrison poem fragments. The first was originally called \\"Abortion Stories\\".<br /><br />There's blood on the street, it's up to my ankles<br />There's blood on the streets, it's up to my knee<br /><br />The second poem in the song is spoken by Morrison, and was originally titled \\"Ghost Song\\".<br /><br />Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding<br />Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind<br /><br />Blue Sunday is a tender love song that's a nice change of pace for the album. Ship Of Fools and Land Ho work in tandem to bring metaphoric images of the sea together with good rock n' roll. I like the slow, bluesy and sensual The Spy, too. Queen Of The Highway and Indian Summer are both rather forgettable, then the album closes with the blues flavored rock of Maggie McGill.<br /><br />Morrison Hotel was a return to form for The Doors after their somewhat disappointing attempt at a rockestrated epic, [[ASIN:B000002I2G The Soft Parade]]. It doesn't get much better for Doors' fans than some of this stuff, but like every Doors' album, there are some weak spots.

0060007737|3.0|This book was supposedly a classic on the subject of branding some years ago. It's age certainly shows, having gotten around to reading it only recently.    For me it was basically a far less captivating version of Douglas Rushcoff's \\"Media Virus\\" - for me, the true ground breaker on the subject of branding.    I suppose the problem with any popular book about branding is this: as soon as it's concepts are popularized and utilized by any and every below-the-line boutique marketing joint in town, the concepts are rendered obsolete.    Further compounding this are extremely aging remarks - from the latest edition - along the lines of 'well, I suppose one day the internet will really find it's feet and become an important part of the proccess'.     Do ya think...!
0340818867|5.0|I've only just begun reading, but so far, it's been quite enjoyable. The author writes with humor. I've some British online friends. I've been able to use tidbits from the book when joking around with them.
1400082773|5.0|The story of Barack Obama is one that gives me a lot of hope and inspiration.  I had read the Audacity of Hope last year and liked it but wasn't riveted. This book is much more riveting - the personal story of a young man's journey to find himself. It is a unique story but one that, I think, we can all empathize with.  Obama is truly the child of the dramatic cultural shifts of the post WW2 years.<br />I picked this up the other day at my son's home and have found such an insight to who Obama is now and how he got here.  I wonder if any political personality has ever been so good at communicating his own humanity and his understanding of the American people?  I love the hope and honesty Obama shares!

0452289963|5.0|I have always been interested in books about spiritual themes.  I have loved Tolstoy, Joseph Campbell, Thich Nhat Hanh, Henry Nouen, Emerson, Thoreau, and many other enlightened writers and poets. I have been through Catholic, Quaker, Presbyterian and Buddhist phases.  There are things I love about all these traditions. I have always wanted grasp the deeper truth behind them that would illustrate the unity behind all these seemingly disparate traditions.<br />I think that in this book Eckhart Tolle has done an amazing job of putting the core of spirituality into contemporary terms.  I liked his book The Power of Now but I think that he has refined the clarity of his message even further here. I hope that those who need to put down Oprah and don't want anyone to talk about spiritual subjects in nonbiblical, nonsectarian language will not stop people who are really looking for realistic and helpful insights into living an enlightened life. Take wisdom where you find it.

B000BZIT5M|5.0|Five stars for the production - a truly exquisite cast (I've adored Ileana Cortubas ever since experiencing the Glyndebourne dream cast version of Le Nozze di Figaro.)  However, there is a caveat regarding subtitles. I don't know if it's something universal for opera dvds or just Kultur video productions (I didn't have this issue with the aforementioned Arthaus Musik dvd.) And it's really only a minor cavil, since I'm not an opera buff just an enthusiastic neophyte.  My problem was that the subtitles were insufficient - sometimes they were there, sometimes they weren't. Sure, they don't need to translate every \\"Buon Giorno\\" since we can all pretty much understand that. But there were whole passages which were omitted. It can be argued that it's for the music which we watch and enjoy opera(which we do!), but it helps us newbies if we can also know (rather than infer) what's being sung.  As this was my first time ever watching a full production of \\"La Boheme\\", I found this marginally distracting (though, thanks to the superb acting ability of the entire cast[as mentioned by several other reviewers], linguistic incomprehension was vitiated by the visual aids of the actors' gestures and facial expressions.)    Definitely recommended on all counts, but those inexperienced opera viewers or anyone not fluent in Italian should be forewarned and may want to have a translated libretto on hand while watching this.

1592332803|5.0|First, an admission. I'm not vegan.  I have a dairy allergy but I still loved baked goods--I love to bake them and I love to eat them. The biggest challenge for me is finding the right balance of soy milk and oils in baking.  I've had so many mishaps.  So to find a book that doesn't rely on any dairy products is wonderful. I was anxious about buying this book because I thought that it would be too earthy-crunchy or use hard-to-find ingredients or just be too strange. Instead, it is chock full of great recipes, is presented very well and the recipes are easy to follow.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
0312379293|5.0|Two social groups come together in a pub.  Danny Cartwright is out celebrating his engagement to Beth.  Four nobs are out celebrating one of their birthdays.  When one of the nobs insults Beth, the matter gets taken outside into the alley.  Beth's brother is killed and the nobs frame Danny for the murder.  Not everyone believes that he is guilty.  Some reviewers have compared this to the Count of Monte Cristo (a wrongfully convicted man seeking revenge).  In the plot, Danny is reading that novel in the prison library.<br /><br />One gets a good look at the British legal system, as well as the class system.  Danny is a garage mechanic from London's East End who somehow got through school without learning to read and write (he is exceptionally smart, and has an amazing somewhat photographic memory).  He is well liked, and has his allies.<br /><br />Locked away in prison, he has nothing else to do with his time, and two years of concentrated study can bring about major changes.  Call it a finishing school.<br /><br />The villains do not have the solidarity they might desire (there are always weak reeds) and tend to get themselves in deeper over time.  There is some very interesting legal maneuvering.  There is also some information about Swiss banking.<br /><br />It might be noted that the author spent two years in a prison (as well as time in the House of Commons and House of Lords).  He had the unique opportunity to research material for the novel first hand.  It might also be noted that he attended Oxford University and cast the villains in the novel as being from Cambridge University.

B00000K413|5.0|Unlike some \\"remasters,\\" this one delivers the audio quality goods. It's mastered much louder, so don't be fooled by that. After correcting for the different levels, this remaster has much better image size, instrument separation, and superior treble resolution, as compared to my original late-80s CD (wish I still had the vinyl). The remaster is a bit on the chilly, digital side, but it is still an obvious (i.e., noticeable in the first 5 seconds) improvement over the original, which sounds closed-in by comparison.

For too long, we've had this high-school history view of the founding of our goverment. I've found it interesting to learn that politics then wasn't much different from politics now, with its share of violent arguments and outright backstabbing.<br /><br />However, I believe that the casting of Paul Giamatti in the lead role was a crucial mistake. He simply does not exhibit the emotional range that this character requires, and his expressions seem to range from a befuddled, blank look to a smirk. Laura Linney, an excellent actress, was a fine choice for Abigail, but I've often had the sense that she was holding back so as not to embarrass Giamatti too much. I'm glad that HBO has created this series, and I intend to watch the remaining episodes, but I doubt that I will buy the DVD set.
0385338724|3.0|A fun, light-hearted chicklit book that is very predictable. I'm obsessed with Sophie Kinsella but I thought this new book paled in comparison to her Shopaholic series.

0670018651|1.0|A perfume guide: Sounds like a wonderful idea, doesn't it? Something to help you navigate the flood of scents at the department store counters, to help you sort through the dross and pluck out the gold. I hoped that this is what this book would be. But sadly, it is not. This book is hardly \\"The Definitive Guide\\" to fragrance that it claims to be. It should have been titled \\"The Highly Subjective and Personal Opinions of Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez.\\" Do a little bit of research and you'll find that they offer fawning praise to all the work a particular perfumer, while inexplicably tearing apart another. Reading this book, the untutored consumer will believe that all the perfumes by the great old French house of Caron (no affiliation, I don't work for them, I just admire them) have very recently been reformulated and now smell disappointing, terrible, awful. However, I was just at the Caron boutique in New York yesterday, and they smell as wonderful as ever. I even tested them against some of my older samples. No difference. None. Clearly, there's something fishy going on here. The reviews are influenced by something other than the quality of the perfumes themselves.  Not that I would have thought too highly of this book even if it were untainted. The authors' humor was entertaining at first, but after a few dozen pages of it, the constant avalanche of snark became strained. And the tone of the prose is a bit lowbrow for my taste. Example: Dr. Turin's favorite descriptive word seems to be \\"cr_p.\\" I had such high hopes for this book, but I ended up sending it back. If you do happen to pick it up, take it with a mine-full of salt. And most importantly: Trust your own nose.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I bought a copy of this DVD.  It was packaged in a folded cardboard envelope.  I was disappointed.  I watched 20 minutes of it and the scratches on the disk from the packaging made it lock up.  Took it back, and the store swapped it for another.  Same problem, but this time I got 40 minutes in before it yorked.  Took the 2nd copy back and asked for my money.  They gave me a hard time but I finally prevailed.  I will wait until the jerk who picked out the packaging gets fired and an adult decides to spend the 23 cents for a proper plastic DVD box.

B0000029GA|5.0|I know people say this a lot but Nasir Jone's \\"Illmatic\\" is the best Hip Hop of all time. NOW, it may be hard to believe but there are very few albums like this that can deliver true-given lyrics about ghetto life in such a beautiful, insightful, complicated and poetic matter. Nas was the hype everybody was talkin about back in 1992 but soon gained buzz when his song \\"Halftime\\" came out and the rest is history. This album put Nas on the map, and also remains his \\"magnum opus\\" if you will. \\"Illmatic\\" is one of those special albums that created the \\"East Coast Renaissance\\" along with the Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep and Notorious B.I.G. and that was also considered the Golden Age of Hip Hop.<br /><br />Illmatic comprises of 10 tracks, 9 of which are actually songs excluding \\"The Genesis\\" which is an intro. But those 9 songs are all included in the top 100 songs of Hip Hop indefinetly. Nas's lyrics are undeniably his best, he tells a story every single song, and although his lyrics and delivery is a but complicated at times, Nas does it seemlessly that you would think he was born with that kind of lyrical talent. The production value is at an all time high with legendary producers DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Large Professor, L.E.S. and Q-Tip, this is (in my opinion) the epitomy of Hip Hop production teams coming from the East Coast. The production is filled with soul, jazz as well as dark and gritty samples. There are no fillers on the album, as well there should be. This is considered to be one of the greatest hip hop albums in history, and undoubtly so, this album isn't the perfect album but it is damn near close to perfection. This album automatically sored NAS to legendary status, an album that deserves your hard earned money and is essential to own in any music collection.<br /><br />1) The Genesis - Nas and AZ speaking in slang while you hear a train passing by, basically creating the atmosphere of the album giving you a feeling as if you are about to enter the dark ghetto's of New York. It's amazing and feels overwhelming. N/A<br /><br />2) N.Y. State of Mind - a Preemo production. This was the very first song I heard from Nas, although I didn't like at first it grew on me. Nas's retrospect of New York and everything thats happening around his environment. This is the darkest and grittiest track on the album but its classic EASTCOAST. Great way to start off the album . 10/10<br /><br />3) Life's A Bitch feat. AZ - this is the only song that features someone other than NAS. AZ opens up the song with a great unforgettable verse, and Nas finishes  it like a G droppin' knowledge. This song is a prime example of how people normally view life. This is a song of reminicing just to say \\"Just live life to the fullest\\". The jazzy production is a great compliment to Nas and AZ's lyrics, also feat. Nas's father \\"Olu Dara\\" on the trumpet. 10/10<br /><br />4) The World Is Yours - YES!!!! this is one of my favorite tracks. Pete Rock produces this track and it is so silky and smooth. The Piano melody and sampling is just perfect. Nas's lyrics are great and his message is \\"THE WORLD IS YOURS FOR THE TAKING\\". Great song and in my top 5 of Nas songs. 10/10<br /><br />5) Halftime - if there would ever to be considered a filler track on the album, this would probably be it. Although every song on this album is Classic, this song is probably the weakest. Nas's lyrics are great as usual and the beat is good as well but the concept of the song isn't as great. I Never got it. This is Nas's debut single of his career to the music industry and will always be recognized as \\"just\\" that, nothing more. 9.5/10<br /><br />6) Memory Lane (Sittin' In Da Park) - MY FAVORITE SONG ON THE ALBUM. This is an example of DJ Premiers production genius at hand, he samples and scratches with pride on this track  and I Just love it. Nas's lyrics are bascially about reminicing and in metaphor sittin in the park just thinkin about life. I memorized every single line of this song,Nas is just a lyrical beast and his storytelling is just amazing in every aspect. 10/10<br /><br />7) One Love - speaking of Nas's storytelling, this is his best. Nas tells the story of one of his homies in jail to which he is writing too, telling him everything that is happening during his time in prison. Q-Tip of \\"A Tribe Called Quest\\" produced this track, and he does a fine job. Nas has a knack for storytelling. I would consider this to be Nas's signature track and also their is a music video for this song. 10/10<br /><br />8) One Time 4 Your Mind - Nas droppin knowledge to the young black youth. Telling everybody that sometimes you have to do things \\"By Any Means Necessary\\". Great lyrics by Nas once again. 10/10<br /><br />9) Represent - a dark beat, Nas just continues to rap phenominally. Nas is consistant. The beat is so catchy that you would wish it was yours. Represnt yourself, Nas implies to \\"represent yourself well and with pride\\". 10/10<br /><br />10) It Ain't Hard to Tell - The last song on the album and it is a good way to end it. The production on this track isn't one of my favorites, the production is kinda sloppy in my opinion, and the Micheal Jackson sample wasn't a very good idea because it doesn't flow well with the beat. But Nas's lyrics save the song. 9/10amazing in every aspect. 10/10    7) One Love - speaking of Nas's storytelling, this is his best. Nas tells the story of one of his homies in jail to which he is writing too, telling him everything that is happening during his time in prison. Q-Tip of \\"A Tribe Called Quest\\" produced this track, and he does a fine job. Nas has a knack for storytelling. I would consider this to be Nas's signature track and also their is a music video for this song. 10/10    8) One Time 4 Your Mind - Nas droppin knowledge to the young black youth. Telling everybody that sometimes you have to do things \\"By Any Means Necessary\\". Great lyrics by Nas once again. 10/10    9) Represent - a dark beat, Nas just continues to rap phenominally. Nas is consistant. The beat is so catchy that you would wish it was yours. Represnt yourself, Nas implies to \\"represent yourself well and with pride\\". 10/10    10) It Ain't Hard to Tell - The last song on the album and it is a good way to end it.

0553582461|5.0|After reading the prior Tawny Man books, I was really worried about finishing the series.  My fear was that this was going to be yet another long book about how sad and pathetic Fitz's life has become because he is compelled by duty to wallow and wither away in the shade with grievous self defeating thoughts.  I'm glad I read this book and restored is my faith in Robin Hobb's storytelling choices.  This book was filled with adventure with several things going on at once, with a pace that kept me reading through at a fast clip.  I loved the choice she made for Fitz at the end which merited his journey.  His hero journey is now complete, his character 'arc' is finished with grand style.  So many times, I was worried the tale would turn on its end, as I kept glancing how many pages where still left unread, fearing that Hobb would repeat the dismal ending she has employed many times throughout this series.  This is definitely a book to read if you have journeyed this far in the series.  Hope you enjoy and happy reading.
0783240236|4.0|When I rented this movie, I expected to see a dated film with awful special effects. What I got was a whirlwind of suspense and mystery.      Tippi is your average upper class wealthy women. She meets a man in a bird shop looking for some lovebirds and is instantly intriuged. When the man can't find the love birds and leaves, she orders them and brings them to his small weekend home by the beach where he, his sister, and his mother live. When Tippi arrives...mysterious things start to happen. Various birds attack the people of this town. The citizens say that it's impossible: How can birds with supposed low intelligence attack every human they see?      This movie is slightly dated, but it doesn't diminish the fact that it is incredibly suspenseful. I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of this movie.      Squab anyone?

B0007DAZW8|5.0|. . . whether one dances . . . or not, does not detract from the beauty of Daft Punk doing what they do best: Electronic Music.  I am glad that they were able to express this vibe (Human After All), perhaps alluding to us all living repetitive existence, which adds dimension to their complete works.  I am very interested in what they will do next with their computers: possibly we will hop, skip, dance, and sing Zen to our Id without moving a muscle.
1416914293|5.0|The events of recent have left the shadowhunter members of the Clave broken and confused. Jace and Clary are trying to reestablish their relationship as being platonic after finding out that they are brother and sister. Simon is sullen and moody, and Clary thinks he's preoccupied with his previous battle with the greater demon ,Abaddon. In reality he is caught up in her, after being in love with her for years and not telling her.<br /><br />To complicate matters further someone is killing downworlder children and the Clave suspects Valentine's hand. What is it that he wants this time? And when one of the mortal instruments goes missing does it have anything to do with the murders.<br /><br />I confess, I waited for this book for almost a year after reading the first book, \\"City of Bones\\". When it came into the bookstore where I work I literally screeched on the floor. \\"It's here! It's here! It's here!\\" And then I promptly knocked over my coffee in an effort to get to it. I bought a copy and then set it aside for a few days. I waited for a day off when I could lock myself in my apartment with food and caffeine and shut my phone off and just... enjoy the ride. The last time I did that was, well... with \\"City of Bones\\", actually.  I must say, the wait was well worth it. I got exactly what I wanted from the book. Clare is such an amazing writer, and amazing storyteller, and a phenomenal voice in urban fantasy.  I am upset that I read through the book in one day, but I knew I would. I might have to reread it slower now, just to make it last a little longer. I fear I am going through withdrawal now. Blimey... withdrawal over a book! It's that addictive. Trust me. Addictive, and glorious, and completely absorbing.
B00133KFGW|1.0|What a great idea for a movie and absolutely awful script. Make a list of cliches (make it long!) and see if this movie misses even one of them. It's nothing but cliches with some very good actors that should have protested having this bad a script. Oh, if you are wondering, the worst movie of all time is \\"You light up my Life.\\" If you saw that, this isn't quite that bad. I found myself sitting there saying \\"they're not going to...\\" and they always did. Seriously embarassing with some terrific music and terrific actors. Blame the script and the Director. Oh, and someone explain to me how Loren Mazel taught this kid to direct. The kid did a great job faking the guitar he couldn't play, but the conducting was beyond terrible. Walk outside and stare at a brick wall. It will be more enjoyable than August Rush!

B000BTJDGC|5.0|Whether you enjoy this movie or not depends a lot upon your expectations. It's impossible to think about a movie with this theme without recalling The Exorcist, projectile green vomit and all. That movie was just flat out scary. If I were to compare this movie to any other, it would be The Sixth Sense. The tone, the pallet, the hushed conversations, and the supernatural, all elements that make this a riveting movie. I was literally on the edge of my seat, not wanting to miss a word. For a movie with a central theme of an exorcism, it was amazingly grounded. It is after all based on a true story. No need for over the top theatrics. Having said that, the performance by Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose was horrifying. Just to be clear, I mean that in a good way. Empathetic and startling. All the actors are great. A-list all the way. More than anything, I found this movie thought provoking. After watching the classic The Exorcist, I just thought, \\"Wow! That was scary!\\" After watching this I thought, \\"Wow! I need to...read my Bible, or pray, or...something!\\" Watch it with a few friends and than prepare for a lively discussion afterward.
0316067598|5.0|Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell shares the tragic story of Operation Redwing in June, 2005, where his ill advised vote to spare the lives of three Afghani shepherds culminated in an ambush that caused the largest casualty in Navy SEAL history. Luttrell's disdain for the liberal U.S. media is certainly understandable, as it became one of the reasons why he hesitated to follow the strict military code in such chance encounters with unarmed civilians during a covert operation. Mr. Luttrell's strong Christian beliefs and compassion, however, appeared to be more responsible for his hesitancy to kill the three Afghans. Regardless, Operation Redwing was a dangerous mission in unfamiliar terrain. This is war, and sh*t happens. A tactical mistake was made, and Luttrell's team was ambushed by a force of at least 100 Taliban fighters loyal to the Taliban commander this SEAL team was tasked with killing. What followed was a jaw-dropping account of valor and courage under fire by this team of four who were outmanned, outgunned, and outeverythinged. Luttrell's teammates were lethally trained warriors who fought as warriors and paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country in an unbelievable turn of events hard to stomach even in a fictional Hollywood movie. Against all odds, Lottrell lived to tell the story.     Lone Survivor began with Mr. Luttrell's \\"redneck\\" (his admission) youth in a small town in Texas, his SEAL training in Coronado, a tour of duty in Iraq and finally Afghanistan and Operation Redwing. His initial description of the SEALs had a bombastic tone to it, and his belief that Saddam had strong links to Al Qaeda (page 35 of the hardcover), and a uranium-235 mobile spinning program are not even supported by Dick Chaney at this point.     Nevertheless, America should be proud of fiercely trained and patriotic soldiers such as Marcus Luttrell, who take on insurmountable odds on a moment's notice. As John Chatteron (\\"Shadow Divers\\") put it, \\"It's what a person does at the moment of his greatest struggle that shows him who he really is.\\" In Lone Survivor, Marcus Luttrell shares the story of his and his teammates greatest struggle and shows the world who the SEALs really are.
B000068FWC|5.0|This was one of my favorite LP's when it came out years ago. THen came along CD's, and over the years I somewhat forgot about the group. A few years back, tho, I purchased a \\"Best Of\\" CD, only to be disappointed in the way the long instrumentals at either the front or the end of the song had been snipped. So, I was very happy to see this CD released, and I now enjoy hearing Goodbye Stanger in its entirety (the instrumental at the end is worth the wait!!) and I get to hear Long Way Home with it's fantastic strings building and the strong piano presence before the harmonica comes in. This is a great CD. Highly recommend!!!
B000FTWB7G|4.0|Personally, I'm a Peanuts Whalum fan.  Love jazz; smooth jazz..and even the Dixie Chicks.  But this is what my granddaughter wanted.  So ordered it for her.  She is happy!  She is particular about what she likes and doesn't like.  So if this is your kind of music, get it.
B000XJ5TOK|5.0|Although based on a video game, the movie has an original screenplay which explains the cause of the T-virus outbreak which is the focus of the video game series. You do not need to have played the video game  to watch this film. In fact, the plot is not entirely congruent with the video games series.      The special effects are well done and the eerie score really adds to the atmosphere of the film. The picture quality on Blu-ray is excellent.     The movie is strong enough to stand on its own in the sci-fi/horror genre without any tie-in to its video game ancestry. The sequels; however, are both disappointing when compared to the potential shown in this film with the last film in the series being the better of the two sequels.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The Ark of Truth is just as well-produced as the infamous, award-winning TV series on the SciFi Channel, and ties up the loose ends that the last season couldn't manage. A must see for any Stargate SG1 fan, it brings to final endgame the pieces that seemed to foretell humanity's doom... but once again, SG1 saves the day.    What was otable was that this final summary leaves open the possibility of future movies, either big screen or direct to DVD as this product was.

B000UD0ESA|3.0|It'd be nice if they'd release a version with EVERYTHING. ALL the extra footage and extended scenes, narration, and so forth. The only thing I really liked about this version was that they fixed Zhora's death chase scene.     Disk two has a featurette, which is over 3 hours long. If you are a true fan of this movie, you will savor every second of it. But if you're not, you could be bored silly (I was). Because they go into serious detail.  I also thought they would do a segment comparing all the different versions of this movie, but they didn't. In one segment, they showed the Millennium Falcon building they put in the cityscape, but no one mentioned it verbally, which seemed odd.     It would also had been nice if they showed the deleted scenes seperately that they talked about in the featurette. But they didn't. They covered too much of the unimportant elements and too little of the important stuff.
B0000640SA|5.0|I love the case for this edition. It's like a case file that Cops, Psychiatrists, etc. use. The extras are pretty nice, but I love this movie, so I would recommend this movie anyway.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|Tim Burton's Sweeney Todd is wonderful. It's a typical Burton piece, beautiful, stylized, and funny - but weird. I thought the segment in which Johnny Depp's Sweeney sang \\"My Friends\\" was incredibly strong, both musically and artistically. Burton's imagination and Depp's talent were both impressive. Depp is certainly not a professional singer but he is more than adequate vocally and nobody is better dramatically.     I thought the decision to cast very young actors, they were all teenagers at the time, in the roles of Anthony, Johanna, and Toby was inspired. Ed Sanders as Toby was particularly impressive. He was only 13 or 14 but he really can sing.     I also enjoyed Jayne Wisener as Johanna. Although she was only marginal musically, her youth and beauty made Judge Turpin's obsession with her entirely believable. In fairness to Wisener, I should point out that Johanna's role has traditionally been taken on the stage by classically trained coloratura sopranos, which Wisener certainly is not.. A change was made to her character in the film. In the stage version she is palpably nuts and ends up shooting the asylum keeper, Fogg, after Anthony rescues her. In the movie she is just sad and naïve. I thought that it worked.    My only caveat to Burton's Sweeney is that it is haunted by the ghosts of George Hearn and Angela Lansbury, the quintessential Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett. Both have great voices and are strong actors but, alas, Lansbury is in her 80s and Hearn in his 70s. Where are they when we need them.      Hearn's and Lansbury's absence from Burton's Sweeney made it inevitable that Depp as Sweeney and Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett would be compared to them - a contest that Depp and Bonham Carter would have to lose. Bonham Carter was barely adequate vocally. Nevertheless, I found her songs to be mostly effective and she shone dramatically. Despite her character's often monstrous conduct, Bonham Carter gave us a Mrs. Lovett who is pitifully sad but somehow sympathetic. Ultimately, she is her own worst enemy, the victim of her obsession with Sweeney.     I give both Depp and Bonham Carter high marks for even being willing to take on this viciously difficult piece. Sondheim's music is closer to opera than it is to traditional musical theater and I can think of nothing in the repertoire that is as hard to sing as Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett's songs.     Despite its cast's vocal limitations, Burton's Sweeney stands on its own as a brilliant musical homage to classic horror movies. Highly recommended, 9 out of 10.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love all of Miyazaki's movies, this one being my favorite. It's a very moving story, which takes some pointers from movies like Alice in Wonderland. This movie is good for kids, and adults alike.
B000002LPD|5.0|I love this album!  In the Sammy/Le Roth wars I tend to strongly lean on the Le Roth side.  That being said this might just be my favorite VH album.  Astounding guitar opening with Poundcake and onto a mostly upbeat with dark corners and listening to it feels like being a kid again first time on Disney Rollercoaster Ride.  Their is pure rocking fun, light hearted upbeat jams, shet talking, made solos and outstanding song sound production and punctuated with rather prophetic social commentary.  The album is best listened to it on its own to be best appreciated as opposed to pulling out single songs onto a mixed greatest hits compilation which I feel damages the overall effect.    If you are gonna get any of the Van Hagar Albums this one is clearly it!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I bought this DVD for the stars in it, then fell in love with the music.   As a 77 year old, I remember the many movie musicals, (Music Man, My Fair Lady, Oklahoma, etc.) and wondered why there wasn't any now. You just have to find them hidden in a heart warming movie.
B000W4HJ44|5.0|Everything about the movie made me want to get up and dance and sing with the people in this film.  It feels like everyone on the movie was having a great time and brought their \\"A\\" game to this one and it really shows throughout.  I'm not normally into this style of movie but i had no problem loving this one from beginning to end.  While the movie runs at about 2 hours you won't really notice.  I was so engrossed in this that i might just break down and get the soundtrack to it as well.<br /><br />Also this edition has a 2nd disc with LOADS of features on everything about the movie process from the music to hair, makeup, dancing and just coming up with ideas to make this not a complete copy of the musical or the orignal Hairspray (Ricki Lake, Divine, Ruth Brown and others starred in that one).  Its a movie that anyone and everyone in the family can watch nothing to worry about hiding the kids from except maybe the occasional kiss between different characters.<br /><br />While everyone has fun in this one there's a deeper issue going on in this one and that's the racial prejudice that were evident during that time.  With the Corny Collins show (hosted by James Marsden who can sing). Its probably better to just check it out if you haven't already seen the original it was and still is an issue in today's society.  I thought it was important to have that in there and keep it true as its something that needed to be touched on even in an overall fun and enjoyable film like this.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Queen Latifah, John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, James Marsden, Elijah Kelly (who all get their chance to shine both singing and dancing) round out an excellent and well acted movie and its worth every penny to purchase and partake in this great movie.
B000JK8OYU|2.0|Not what I thought it would be, and the recordings don't sound like the original hits.
0375842209|5.0|Where to begin?  I think it should be considered an adult book. Putting it under the young adult section probably prevents it from being more widely read.    It is the most unforgettable book I have ever read. I felt actually sucked into it as if I was living the story. I didn't want to let the characters go. Every one of them came alive to me, and I cared about all of them, even the villains (except Hitler, of course). I couldn't put it down and the next day, I had to start reading it over again. A heart wrenching story that shouldn't be missed. I don't think I will ever for get Liesel Meminger, Rudy, Hans, Rosa, and all the rest including the unusual narrator.  Give it a try. You won't regret it!
B000RJO578|4.0|This is one of the best action movies of the decade.  Not only does it purposefully follow other action films but contains tongue in cheek references to the other greats.  Simon Pegg is brilliant as Sgt Angel and Timothy Dalton is absolutely despisable as a villian.  This movie is great for a laugh and for the over the top action one can expect from modern gun toting cop flicks.
0783231202|3.0|What an opportunity for a great film: the drama, the tragedies, the historical crossroads, the meaning for US history in the state of birth...<br />I am often opposed to remakes, but this story would deserve a competent serious new version without the cute little Hollywood cliches and without the music that envelops everything in sugar coating.<br />I am not sure which parts of the tale are historic and which are added by the script writer or Spielberg. I find it hard to believe in John Quincy Hopkins, and if the real man did make this speech, it was a great one and would have deserved to be acted without the horrible sentimental soundtrack. The whole part is such a terrible cliche, it almost does not matter if it is historically correct. The esthetic conventions of inferior Hollywood productions should be banned from serious subjects.<br />(Was Martin van Buren really this awful as President?)<br />I would still say, the film is worth watching, but it is so unsatisfactory.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This film came out a few years before the famed 300 movie by graphic novelist Frank Miller and a year before Frank Miller's Sin City who were both shot on green screen backgrounds.  Entirely shot on green screen backgrounds.  I remember watching this movie when it first came out and hardly heard any buzz over the way the movie was made and how none of the scenes were shot on location anywhere except for on some Hollywood studio lot. I didn't too much care of the way it was made to fully appreciate it.  I just went to the theater with a friend expecting to see another action movie.  Well that's what I got. Cinematically though, it was a true gem.<br /><br />It was only after watching 300 that I remembered about this movie and could have sworn that it was shot in similar fashion, and low and behold it sure was.  Boy, what an entertaining way to make a vintage-looking film without all that production value behind expensive movie sets and expensive trips to different destinations across the world.  It really deserves a second or third go around to fully appreciate today's cinematic technology and how we can easily still enjoy a movie if we suspend reality a bit, as long as the story is entertaining and tickles our imagination.<br /><br />The storyline is of course not believable, that's why this movie should fall under the Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre, but without a doubt it is still an entertaining story and look at a world of yesteryear and what many foretellers would truly see as the world of tomorrow.  Robots, mad-scientists, and hidden islands with prehistoric animals running amuck.  Man's imagination of the future.<br /><br />So before you go hailing 300 as the future of movie-making, you should check out Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow and appreciate it for its nostalgic feel and much better acting than that of a few greased up hulking Spartans.
B000FIMG68|5.0|I ordered this to add to my collection.  I now own all three seasons.
B00005AG7K|5.0|Any Beatle related movie is a treat! From the inadvertant innovators of music videos, which stirred the minds of the creators of MTV, this \\"movie\\" was great to watch, but the picture quality could have been greatly improved if it had the quality of the vhs release by Apple Records instead of what looks to be from the first vhs release from Media (which was the Beatles error by people wearing all white outfits), but all 'n all it was truly a long awaited release and as \\"Sir Paul\\" once said of the movie \\"it's the only place you'll see John Lennon performing \\"I am the Walrus\\"! Bravo!!!!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was just bubbling with enthusiasm before watching it because I wanted to know how the Ori storyline ended.I like it a lot. Nice with surprises. There is a scene towards the end with Cam and Sam which I thought was cute.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have only seen the first two episodes, and have to say that this is so far, a very, very good work. This is not the story of great men being great, it is the story of a human man, with normal flaws and doubts, being thrust into a situation where he, and his fellows, rise to the occasion--even as they wish they did not have to. Even the men who you wind up disliking are not villains--they are people. They have their own thoughts and concerns, and are not \\"bad guys\\".    This is not spectacle. It is not explosions and violent conflict portrayed larger than life. It is, rather, the process by which the Founding Fathers pushed, and drug, each other to recognize the need to break free of the Crown.    People have complained about the cinematography. I think all I have seen fits the atmosphere the era quite well.    If you like history, or human drama, this one is one to buy. And, HBO is to be commended for brining this story to the screen in this miniseries.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful. You'll want to hear it over and over. The soundtrack<br />is much better than the movie. He sounds a lot like Cat Stevens.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|The series finale of Stargate: SG-1 was really an un-ending. It totally left us hanging in the middle of the Ori conflict. The Ark of Truth attempts to close the story in a satisfying way, but in my opinion, falls short. What has happened is, the entire planned 11th season was condensed into a 90-minute movie. And that's really what it feels like.    I will say that the movie benefits from a second viewing, and when viewed more as an episode of the series, it feels a little better. However, there were better action sequences in countless episodes than there are to be found in AoT. In places it just felt like it drug on a bit. In others, it felt rushed.    If you're not a fan of the series, no need to start with this. If you are, it's a must-have for the collection and as a lead-in to the next movie, Continuum.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Loved this movie in the theatre. Very artsy, intense and great use of Beatles music. Highly recommend.
1591841992|5.0|This book should be taught at the college level.  It is an extremely well written book that captures the essence of business communication and what it should be.  How many of us have sat through boring word wall presentations of list after list of speakers notes.  The next time someone makes me sit through one I am going to send them this book.<br /><br />The basic concepts of Visual Thinking: Look, See, Imagine, Show are helpful in providing a framework for developing your thoughts prior to starting any presentation.  Then using the SQVID guide to understand what type of picture to use helps you think through the problem and finishing with the author's six ways we see and show of Who/what, how much, where, when, how, and why provides a guide for how to communicate your ideas.<br /><br />I never read a business book twice but find myself studying this one.  I have read over 50 business books in the last 18 months and this is at the very top of my list.
B00003CXS4|4.0|Whoever said Brad Pitt was just a pretty boy? Here he shows a mastery of comic timing. Every word that comes out of his mouth is totally incoherent. Marvelous! This film has \\"Pulp Fiction\\" stamped all over it. They sell the screenplay to \\"Pulp Fiction\\" in the classics sections of bookstores in England, believing it comparable to \\"Bleak House\\" and \\"Macbeth.\\" This film was made in the shadow of Tarantino's enormous influence on the Brits who love the antics of down and outers. It has many wonderful bits, combining a kind of Scorsese brutality with a Marx Brothers hilarity. It doesn't quite match its model for invention or genius but it is a lot of fun. It also has the virtue of being politically incorrect and is a tad less romantic than Tarantino's picture, which I remember as cloyingly optimistic. There's been a string of these goofy gangster flicks lately coming out of the UK, all with small-picture scope, but with big-movie acting. All one can do is hope for more.
B000JSI7AI|1.0|This \\"Collector's Edition\\" is a big disappointment. Not only is the transfer exactly the same as on the previous releases, there are not many new extras, anyway. The space of the second disc was probably not at all required. The biggest disappointment is that again the three hour Director's Cut of the movie is not made available.

It is well put together, well researched, and it gives my clients something to study when we are not in session.  Many of 'The Secret' forerunners are caught up in greed.  Jack Canfield is not one of these.  He sincerely wants to help others to have a better life.

B000YAA68C|3.0|Hilary Swank is sniping at her ne'er do well husband Gerard Butler for taking out a loan behind her back and for telling Kathy Bates, her mother, that she does not want children.  You know why I don't want children yet, Gerry, she screams, it's because I don't want to bring them up in this tiny lower east side apartment, where I would be having to change their diapers on the windowsills because this place is so small there's not even room to turn around.  In this opening scene I lost all faith in the movie, since the apartment they are fighting in is a fantastically large 3,500 square feet place with views on every wall of every room and plus, it's decorated like she's a staging contest winner.  I know it's a convention of the movies that every New York apartment, no matter how opulent and grand, is supposed to be tiny and unfit for humans, but this really takes the cake.  If you're going to make your PLOT TURN on how awful and small a LES apartment is, why don't you show one?  Don't show something that looks like Krystle and Alexis could both live there and never bump into each other for a week.  How idiotic, how far removed from real life.  Basically you'd have to have an income of $750,000 yearly to afford the apartment that most of the action takes place in.  And yet Swank and Butler, appealing actors of course, are supposed to be barely making ends meet.<br /><br />The script does manage (barely) to explain away why Swank is always dressed in fabulous Marc Jacobs originals.  She buys them on EBAY, she claims, as though that means they would cost only pennies.<br /><br />I'm sure much of the movie ended up on the cutting room floor.  All of James Marsters' scenes for example, and most of the scenes that inveigled Lisa Kudrow enough to sign on, for the movie we have makes her look to be a one dimensional tease.  She does look exquisite in a Marc Jacobs wedding dress, posed high on a grey carpeted revolving disk in the middle of a bridal salon.<br /><br />You could sort of see where the movie was going, and that's okay, but there came a time where I longed for one more twist.  Here are a few that I dreamed up.  At the end it would be revealed that Hilary Swank had also died of a brain tumor quite early on, too; or another ending where it was revealed that she had actually been married to Jeffrey Dean Morgan and that Gerard Butler was alive and singing \\"Fairytale of New York\\" to her in real time.<br /><br />Who was the actress playing Swank's sister who came from Australia?  Why did they even have her in the movie?  Questions from a man with a deep love for Hilary Swank\\"s oeuvre and who rubbed his hands with glee mounting the airplane when the stewardess announced the movie was going to be \\"PS I LOVE YOU.\\"movie was going, and that's okay, but there came a time where I longed for one more twist.

0618918248|3.0|Please read this objectively before rating its usefulness. My own beliefs are left unstated. With such a controversial topic, the danger is that the star rating gets equated with the rater's agreement of the reviewer's own stated or implied position on God's (non-)existence, not on the reviewer's assessment of Dawkins' own claims for denial of God. I'm summarizing my response to Dawkins as I have hundreds of other books rated by me on Amazon, so I strive here for the same fairness I try to give any author.<br /><br />After reviewing Christopher Hitchens' \\"god Is Not Great,\\" Sam Harris' \\"The End of Faith,\\" and Daniel Dennett's \\"Breaking the Spell,\\" I now come to the fourth in recently amplified rationalizations that both attack religious credulity and assert scientific inquiry. As a scientist, Dawkins shares with Dennett an ease in explaining laboratory findings. As one tending towards social impacts, Dawkins connects with Harris, whom he often cites. As a popularizer of intellectual currents, Dawkins addresses the same audience as Hitchens. I've found all four books fascinating, and all four have caused me to think harder about my own beliefs; all four also contain flaws in their perhaps inevitably sweeping claims that may not prove major, but nonetheless need to also be addressed respectfully.<br /><br />I anticipate many who criticize Dawkins may need reminding of his early caution, twice repeated: \\"I am not attacking the particular qualities of Yahweh, or Jesus, or Allah, or any other specific god such as Baal, Zeus,or Wotan.\\" (31) He counters the \\"God Hypothesis\\" of a \\"superhuman, supernatural intelligence who deliberately designed and created the universe and everything in it, including us,\\" with an \\"alternative view: any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\" Creative intelligences come later into the process and cannot have designed it, therefore our attribution to a Prime Mover or Uncaused Cause is incorrect, and so that's the title of his book. He reiterates: \\"I am not attacking any particular version of God or gods. I am attacking God, all gods, anything and everything supernatural. wherever and whenever they have been or will be invented.\\" (36)<br /><br />Dawkins employs the crane, i.e., a process of gradual construction that allows more complex construction from the ground up, rather than a skyhook, i.e., a \\"deus ex machina\\" (surprisingly he does not use this phrase) that intervenes in the plans from the opposite direction, and lacks an empirical foundation traceable in the geological and genetic and biological records. Despite his credentials, he does seem to fudge Fred Hoyle's Boeing 747 argument as he does Anselm's ontological proof and Thomistic  proofs, causing me to suspect he's stronger in science than philosophy; yet even with his insistent separation of chance from Darwin's theory, I felt as if Dawkins labored to explain this clearly. After he insists that this process is not by chance or by random unplanned happenstance, but by an immensely meticulous and attenuated internal mechanism of advancing by what benefits an organism in its survival, Dawkins enters the territory that Harris, Hitchens, and Dennett have also explored. Religious dictates to truth are undermined by claims using logic, improbability, and lack of external proof. If humans (see Dennett) have an inbred attraction to religion, it's like a moth to a flame-- the insect's been engineered to guide itself by the moon, and has not evolved past the stage of discerning and avoiding artificial light as its beacon.<br /><br />Here, although compared to a radio interview I heard with him he devotes only a fraction of what I would have expected to this topic, Dawkins adds his own emphasis to the atheists' resurgence. I was peeved by his donnish dismissal of theology itself as a respectable endeavor. This may be logically true by histheorem, but it reeks of Oxonian snobbery. He denies that religious faith should be accorded any automatic respect per se. \\"The teachings of 'moderate' religion, though not extremist in themselves, are an open invitation to extremism.\\" (306) That is, any appeal by moderate religious adherents cannot be justified anymore than the extremist interpretations, for both ultimately rest on non-demonstrable standards lacking objective verification.<br /><br />Finally, as with his non-believing colleagues, Dawkins proposes an ambitious counter-attack. Young people, he warns, should not be subjected to beliefs by indoctrination; he agrees with Hitchens that such upbringing amounts to brainwashing. And, as with Harris' urging that if parents simply told the truth to their children, that religion would cease, Dawkins may appear quixotic in such an appeal to reason given our global diversity and immense differences in upbringing. As with Hitchens, Dawkins seeks the long-term vision of humanist nobility, and a sense of our own fragile bursts of life within a universe that on its own terms has plenty to chill, dazzle, and fascinate us.<br /><br />A few of his points in this predictably ambitious book needed sharper focus. For example, Stephen Unwin's Bayesian argument for God's existence is converted by Dawkins into six points, but Dawkins glosses over them in his criticism. On language drift being probable \\"by the cultural equivalent of random genetic drift,\\" Dawkins fails to give sufficient explanation. (189) I'd consult Guy Deutscher's \\"The Unfolding of Language\\" (reviewed by me) for an up-to-date elaboration.<br /><br />Dawkins later leaps into the Stalin/ Hitler atheist debate getting tangled in Adolf's profession of such, striving to uphold his main point: \\"Individual atheists may do evil things but they don't do evil things in the name of atheism.\\" (279) Stalin's \\"dogmatic and doctrinaire Marxism,\\" however, did encourage mass destruction of cultural patrimony and attacks on religious confessionalists, so I became confused at too hubristic a simplification. In less brutal versions, the clash of secular and religious still causes terror, according to Dawkins. Yet, criticizing the right of the Amish to raise children in \\"their own\\" way, Dawkins does not raise the \\"rumspringa\\" option, featured as the title of a recent documentary, that allows young Amish a chance to sample the delights of the world outside before they decide to return to their traditions and continue them. Dawkins overlooks this rather sensible \\"Plan B\\" when it would have strengthened his argument, if unintentionally, that religiously raised children should be given a chance to question their faith and not be treated as if dissent is never an option.<br /><br />Inconsistency in the documented nature of Dawkins' enormously complex assemblage of disparate sources deserves mention. While he introduces his quotations, he unevenly cites them in the endnotes. Furthermore, most chapters have but a few numbered references; not all of the texts he uses can be traced to the bibliography. For a controversial book like this, whose references by challengers and defenders will be hunted down, it's important that the same standards of scholarly reference be applied to every quote, summary, or paraphrase in conventional academic form.<br /><br />When I finished and reviewed Hitchens' (livelier if more pugilistic; however, Dawkins baits the Templeton Foundation very annoyingly too) book a couple of weeks ago, I wondered what would replace the comforts of faith. For Dawkins, the \\"humanitarian challenge\\" must replace God. Even if our well-being depended on a belief in God, Dawkins rejects the truth of such a belief. Without independent criteria, it's next to impossible given the physical evidence that a Creator designed the universe. Dawkins here paraphrases Dennett's distinction between belief in God and belief in belief. Dawkins finds that while atheists may well despair, they appear todo so neither more nor less so statistically than their fellow believers. He also asserts non-believers and believers do not differ in basic morality; he favors, naturally, atheists here.<br /><br />He ends his intermittently engrossing, yet ultimately scattered study with an analogy to \\"the mother of all burkas,\\" asking us to imagine the tiny slit from which we see the world through our electromagnetic spectrum. This vast scale of improbabilities that allows us to live at this moment may be statistically nearly impossible to understand, but Dawkins inexorably insists that this is the only evidence we have.t too hubristic a simplification.

Her rendition of \\"Many Rivers To Cross\\" was so heartfelt, it brought me to tears. I could relate!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|\\"Sweeney Todd\\" has long been my favorite of Stephen Sondheim's works, even though I've never had the pleasure of seeing it live (I own the Broadway album and have watched the Broadway production DVD). Needless to say, I had some trepidation about this film project, since the trailers in advance of the film's release didn't make it clear how much singing would actually take place. I also had some concerns about length, since the stage production runs a bit long. For various reasons, I missed seeing the film in its theatrical release, but I picked up this special edition DVD last week when it came out.<br /><br />I've now watched/listened to the movie five times; I was absolutely delighted the first time through, and my appreciation for it grows each time. It's clear that Sondheim was closely involved in reshaping, and combining, cutting down, and eliminating musical numbers (and the text), and in some cases modifying the lyrics themselves -- and in my opinion, it's all for the better. The movie never lags, never drags -- once it starts, it moves quickly from point to point to its Greek tragedy conclusion. And of the eliminated numbers, the only one I really miss is \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\" (which shows up instrumentally in a few spots).<br /><br />As for Tim Burton's direction and Johnny Depp's acting, they were both made for \\"Sweeney Todd\\". I am so used to Len Cariou's Todd from the Broadway album that I wasn't sure how Depp would bring the necessary gravitas -- vocal and acting -- to the role. But he pulls it off. His Demon Barber is more wraith-like, more detached, almost ghostly -- note his lack of response all through the 'By the Sea' number, not to mention \\"Johanna\\" -- but all the more chilling for that. The rest of the cast is great as well, and Depp and Helena Bonham Carter such a natural chemistry that I was surprised to learn they had never acted together before.<br /><br />My complaints are relatively minor and are endemic to \\"Sweeney Todd\\" itself. First, Helena Bonham Carter's character is, frankly, hard to understand at time, due to her thick accent and use of slang. Second, Sondheim likes to write fast, complicated, and overlapping lyrics, which sound wonderful when performed but can be a pain to decipher. (When I bought the Broadway album, one of the first things I tracked down was the \\"Sweeney Todd\\" libretto.) However, the DVD itself offers a wonderful solution: you can turn on English subtitles.<br /><br />I am listening to the movie even as I type this (\\"...'twas Pirelli's miracle elixir...\\"). My wife's been gone visiting family the past two weeks, and I do most of my work on my laptop sitting on a stool at the kitchen counter. I stick the DVD in to play and simply listen to the soundtrack, occasionally stopping to watch the film itself over my shoulder.<br /><br />As I said, a brilliant adaptation, brilliantly filmed.  ..bruce..er's character is, frankly, hard to understand at time, due to her thick accent and use of slang.

B000NVIXFK|4.0|I have been a Rush fan for many years and, to be honest, I was a bit apprehensive to get their new album.  I thought Vapor Trails was a disaster--still, many years later, I cannot warm up to this album.  Like many albums with Rush, I had to digest this album.  Many times with them, I find myself not liking a certain song initially, but then come to like it.  It's the same with this album.  I love the instrumentals on this album, especially \\"The main monkey business\\". Probably my favorite songs are \\"The way the wind blows\\" and \\"Faithless\\".  The one thing on this album that I love is the acoustic work that Alex does throughout nearly every track.  Geddy's vocals are generally good, but I don't like some of his vocals on \\"Good news first\\"--sounds like he's 14, going through puberty.  \\"Armour and sword\\" is a throw back to the late 70's with it's weird timing elements and catchy beat. Overall, this album is a pretty solid effort that does at times feel retro and progressive at the same time.  This is their best effort overall since the \\"Counterparts\\" album, which I feel is their best album of the modern era--by far.

In one full page photo, there is a picture of Marcus in full combat gear, rifle in ready position, and his name is clearly marked on his chest.<br /><br />I thought is was odd, or coincidence or whatever that the two books on BUD/S were on Marcus's class, pictures and all, and then Lone Survivor comes out which gives you an idea from start to actual missions of one particular guy.<br /><br />Fantastic story, regardless of your politics. I have always admired the SEALs, and this book just reinforces my admiration.
B000065PUE|5.0|\\"Doolittle\\" isn't necessarily *the* crowning achievement from the Pixies, as they didn't have just one defining moment, but they certainly never put out an album that was better than this one. It's dark, it's playful, and artistically beautiful. Every single song on this record is a pure joy. This is one of the few albums I can put on at any time of the day - no matter what I'm doing - and be compelled to listen to it from start to finish. Black Francis and crew really show their stuff here. The evidence on this album that the Pixies were one of the greatest musical acts in the history of music is overwhelming. The Pixies were one-of-a-kind Gods and this is a masterpiece album - need I say more?

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I haven't listen to my CDs for a long while.  This 240 really sounds nice and clear.  It's like listening to music with good amplifiers and speakers at the proper level.  The sound is slightly toward the warm side, but with authority on both the highs and lows.  It has excellent imaging, and is well worth the money.  I also bought the AKG271.  They are very much alike.  If you don't need the features of the 271, then 240 is a better buy because of the lower price.  Both were made in Austria.  Very good quality throughout.<br /><br />I am using them with the stereo receiver or the headphone amplifier.  The sound is very nice and no specialized equipment is needed to achieve this level of joyful experience.

B00008YJHC|5.0|It seems that \\"Bossanova\\" usually doesn't get the best rap among music enthusiasts and most critics. It's really a shame because this album is just as great as their best work - like \\"Doolittle\\" or \\"Surfer Rosa\\". \\"Bossanova\\" has a much more laid-back, surf feel to it, and it's infectious. There are some truly amazing tracks on here and the album flows so effortlessly. If you're already a Pixies fan, there's no doubt about it, just get ahold of this album - it's amazing stuff.
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse-Five (or The Children's Crusade) is an anti-war novel by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. about the bombing of Dresden, Germany at the end of World War II. While Kurt Vonnegut was a POW at Germany he related the experience of being in Dresden through the character of Billy Pilgrim. Billy is deeply disturbed by what he experiences at Dresden and through the rest of his life he travels to different moments in time. He believes that he was abducted by aliens, Tralfamadorians, who can see and travel through all moments in time. This discussion of time is one of the most fascinating parts of the book.    This creates a disjointed effect as Billy tells the story of being captured and sent to Dresden, interspersed with experiences from the rest of his life. Kurt Vonnegut makes interesting use of prose with many repeating phrases, the most common of which is \\"so it goes\\" which comes after death (to include animals and even a glass of water). It seems to create the effect numbing effect of seeing as much death as the author saw in World War II, while at the same time highlighting each instance.    This is a creative and engaging anti-war novel that is also very well written. A very quick read but one that provokes some thought.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|While very slow moving, the film still covers a lot of historical territory.  Young, idealistic college boys join the preWWII espionage agencies in Britain and the US because they want to live lives of importance and make a difference.  Three generations of Yale Skull n Bones, cronyism, the planting of moles in Soviet and American spy establishments, torture, careerism, the competition between the US and the USSR for Nazi physicists, the Cold War, the space race, and finally, the Bay of Pigs fiasco -- these are the big themes of this film, which spans 25 years in the life of Edward Wilson, the young spy who joins the OSS to atone for his father's traitorous mistake.  Add to that the sexual mores of the times (c. 1940) and Edward marries for honor, not for love.  The film casts a critical eye on espionage and the people who undertake it.<br /><br />I liked Matt Damon in this film so much better than in the endless Bourne car chases, although his character is very hard to like.  Unlike some others who have written here, I did not think Angelina Jolie was in any way wasted in this role.  She poignantly plays an emotionally unstable woman who uses her sexuality to catch herself a husband, but ends up finding herself caught in a loveless marriage, so unsuited to be a CIA spouse.  I liked her much better here than in A Mighty Heart.  I agree with other reviewers who said that Robert DeNiro did a much better job directing this film than acting in it.  William Hurt does well as Edward's boss. Alec Baldwin plays a crusty FBI man.  Billy Crudup's British spy is so likeable that you know he will be a problem in the end. John Torturro as aide to Wilson is excellent, as are Oleg Shtefanko as Wilson's KGB counterpart and nemesis and Eddie Redmayne as Wilson's son.<br /><br />The atmosphere, technology, and fashions of the times are also well represented here, which also makes gives the film its claustrophobia. This is a film which improves with multiple viewings, because every bit of dialogue adds a crucial detail to the plot.  It's a very sober enterprise up to and including the last scene, where we see Matt Damon as Wilson plodding diligently down the long hall of the new CIA wing where, as reward for all he has endured over the course of the film, he will be in charge of counterespionage efforts.  His pace and posture make it clear that he heeds the call of duty with a heavy heart.e adds a crucial detail to the plot.

B0000025KI|2.0|With Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978)Bruce Springsteen reached a turning point. It was a very succesful album and his live appearances had proved he had all the ins and outs of an allround modern rocker. So why should he be tied down with those long, complex, bombastic pieces that dominated his previous albums?  Springsteen took the easy road, and it started with the River. No more intriguing musical structures, no frills. Just three chords and go. No more moving, almost journalistic stories as in Meeting Across the River or Jungleland; just plain, ordinary stuff about walking the streets like John Travolta did in the opening scene of Saturday Night Fever, or blatant statements about being a rocker. Yeah baby, I'm a rocker(repeat ad infinitum).  It worked, of course. Millions throughout the world loved The River and almost all the other mediocre albums that would follow.   The River is one of my favorite saturday morning albums. Nice background music with a cup of coffee and the morning papers. When the sun goes down and the tension begins to fill the air, I can always put on Born to Run. That at least is a relief.
B000YD7S26|5.0|I concur with the previous, splendid review. This two DVD set is an important release for capturing von Karajan's brilliant vision of Bruckner's Eighth Symphony, his personal favorite amongst ALL symphonies. I was privileged to attend Karajan's final American performance, and his penultimate anywhere, in February 1989, conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in the Eighth for a flu-ridden Carnegie Hall. Frail and ill, a mere 6 months before his death, his performance felt like a communique from the beyond as he somehow managed a titanic Eighth lasting 100 minutes. That performance seemed to suspend time as his Bruckner communed with the Angels. At its completion, we witnessed Karajan, his breath labored and his shriveled body barely upright, weeping through a 30 minute ovation. The audience wept as well. This performance was captured in June 1979 in St. Florian, Bruckner's own church of the Augustinian Monastery near Linz where he had been organist, and where he lies buried in the crypt beneath the organ. The performance is shorter than that final Eighth, lasting 84 minutes but is nonetheless probing, profound, and touched with an epic grandeur. The orchestral sonority is rich and multi-colored, their playing superb, frequently moving and always thrilling.<br /><br />The unfinished Ninth symphony, anguished, often nightmarish with its machine-like scherzo, chilling trio and dissonant climax that seems to presage the new century, is given a tough reading of great urgency. Although the performance is not technically perfect, its conception is brilliant, the effect staggering. The Vienna Philharmonic sound massive and dark hued: the horns are weighty and monumental, the strings forceful yet lyrical, speaking insistently from out of the darkness, producing shivers down the spine. This is a troubled symphony and we are captive for its duration. The experience is shattering. The Te Deum is beautifully sung, a lofty hymn of praise, the light of faith following the long midnight of the soul. It is a splendid end to a superb concert.<br /><br />These are performances that Bruckner/Karajan aficionados should enjoy and may even find revelatory. Most strongly recommended.<br /><br />Mike Birmansoul. It is a splendid end to a superb concert.    These are performances that Bruckner/Karajan aficionados should enjoy and may even find revelatory.

B0013K6WLM|4.0|The Black Keys' latest release was originally intended as the collaborative product of DJ Dangermouse, Ike Turner, and the title band.  The man responsible for \\"Crazy,\\" a couple of white Midwestern bluesmen, and the guy who almost sent Tina Turner rolling down the river was an unlikely grouping to say the least, and I for one was curious to hear the inevitably bizarre album.  Unfortunately, before this marvelously disparate musical collision could get on its way Ike Turner passed away.  Who knew decades of drug, alcohol, and spousal abuse could end a life so early?  Ike left this plane of existence at the age of seventy-six.    I half expected a DJ Dangermouse mash up between The Black Keys and Li'l Bow Wow (or, does he go by Bow Wow now?), but thankfully Dangermouse decided to mostly stay out of the way and let the Keys do their thing.  If you were to suck all the studio trickery out of Attack & Release you would still have a collection of some damn fine songs.  What Dangermouse ends up doing best is accentuating the open space on the slower songs.  He adds a psychedelic atmosphere that fits perfectly with the classic rock underpinnings of The Black Keys' songwriting, which has always been a few steps closer to Cream and Hendrix than Robert Johnson.    \\"Same Old Thing\\" is perhaps the only song where it feels as if Dangermouse is unsure of Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney's songwriting and unleashes some unnecessary Gil Scot Heron inspired flutes just to gum up the works.  The result is unfortunately more than a little distracting.  Dangermouse is most effective on \\"Psychotic Girl,\\" an acid trip on the bayou that's enhanced by wraithlike backing vocals and eerie piano notes.  Auerbach provides appropriate paranoia-by-moonlight lyrics and infuses even the slower songs with a strong sense of melody, something that had been sorely missing on their previous record.  While most Black Keys albums feel as if they just stop regardless of the whether the last song is an appropriate end point, here \\"Things Ain't Like They Used to Be\\" is a note perfect closer.  The slow-dance pace and female backing vocals add just the right amount of effervescent heartbreak.    I'll put myself on record as being disappointed with The Black Keys' previous album, Magic Potion.  After their superb (and still best) album, Rubber Factory, The Keys sounded listless and without momentum.  The Ohioans needed a new direction.  Attack & Release sounds like a true follow up to Rubber Factory, and even though I can't help but miss their minimalism, I fully welcome their rediscovered sense of adventure.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|I bought this CD about six months ago after hearing Bruce was again working with the E Street Band. While it lacks any overarching theme(s) such as in Born In The USA or Born To Run albums, it still is a great listen as it displays musical sparks from his past efforts while remaining fresh.    The upbeat Livin' In The Future sounds like something he could have recorded with Gary U.S. Bonds in the early 80s, while I'll Work For Your Love is a beautifully sincere song of devotion (probably something we don't hear much in music these days). I regularly listened to Girls In Their Summer Clothes with headphones on while walking to and from work just as the southern summer was approaching and boy did it conjure up some (mostly) happy mental images and it's still conjuring up some images now that the summer is over. A few songs including the title track can take a few listens before they can be really appreciated. This could be because there is not that one overarching theme.     I agree with some of the other reviewers that the sound production sometimes does not feel right, probably somewhat distorted such as in You'll Be Comin' Down (though not a bad song). Overall, the lyrics on this album could be described as interesting in that they sometimes paint a beautiful picture but sometimes can be a little too cryptic. Bruce's lyrics on this album also display quite a fascination with blood..... Hmm!     For an artist who's way past his youth, this is a good return to form. Buying this CD has also taken me back a few years to a time when buying an album was a satisfying experience. John Fogerty's recent Revival release also did something similar.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This miniseries is captivating. Well casted and need I say more... It is an Emmy winner, for sure...
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Director Robert Zemeckis claims he found the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf `boring' when he read it in junior high, and that he intended this film to be decidedly not boring, and thus supplied with ample gore and fornication.  Well, he did succeed in making a non-boring film, though whether the fornication adds much to it is debatable.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the plot of the poem, here it is in a nutshell: In medieval Denmark, the court of the chieftain Hrothgar is ravaged by a man-eating monster named Grendel.  Beowulf, a Swede, arrives with his band of brave thanes (knights), and Beowulf defeats Grendel in hand-to-hand combat.  Hrothgar showers Beowulf with honor, but soon after Grendel's equally vicious mother goes on a killing spree, so Beowulf has to kill her too.  Years later, back in his homeland, the honored Beowulf does one more valiant deed, ridding his land of a dragon, but dying in the process.<br /><br />Thus far the old epic and the Zemeckis film agree.  But this is the 21st century, after all, and you can't just film a classic `as is.'  This is `revisionist' Beowulf.  It turns out Grendel is also the son of Hrothgar, a kind of bloodthirsty payoff for Grendel's mother giving Hrothgar the semi-magical gold drinking horn that bestows prosperity and honor on whoever possesses it.  Grendel's mother, in the form of the seductive Angelina Jolie, likewise seduces Beowulf when he comes to killer but, years later, Beowulf learns that she bore his son--the dragon that he has to dispatch.  In this version, Grendel's mother is a kind of female Satan, tempting brave men to father children by her, then letting those children wreak havoc later on.  It's an interesting twist on the story, and, frankly, a rather silly one--after all, Beowulf, when she seduces him, is already young, handsome, brave, and honored by all--so what is she offering that he doesn't already have, pray tell?<br /><br />Revisionism aside, there is the sex factor.  The two male script-writers apparently have the mental and sexual development of eighth-grade boys, never passing up an opportunity to refer to sex or, even more often, the male crotch.  We never forget that they learned one Old English word to include in the script--`swive' (same as the F word)--and we hear it repeatedly.  Beowulf's thanes are obsessed with seducing the buxom women in Hrothgar's court, and in his famous battle with Grendel, Beowulf chooses to be nude--for no good reason other than holding the audience's attention, wondering if he is ever going to show us a full frontal view (he doesn't), since we're given lots of back views.  In the original poem, Beowulf does indeed take off his armor and lay aside his sword to fight Grendel, for the monster is protected by a magic spell from all weapons.)  In his aerial battle with the dragon at the film's end, Beowulf shows as much concern with dodging things that menace his groin as in killing the dragon.  (Rather like a medieval version of the usual crotch-punishing scenes on America's Funniest Home Videos.) We're also given an unnecessary view of Hrothgar's fat, bare (and computer-generated) behind.  Forgive me for sounding like a stodgy adult here, but this is really low-level scripting, something to make MTV-lobotomized boys snicker.<br /><br />Now the good news: it really is a fairly interesting and watchable action film.  You may know already that what you see on screen was mostly generated via computer, not by live actors.  Ray Winstone, a 50ish actor with a beer gut, gets morphed via the computer into the young, blond, muscled-up (and sometimes nude) Beowulf.  Essentially this is animation that looks awesomely real, and we can thank the techies for giving us an eyeful.  The actors--Winstone, Anthony Hopkins as Hrothgar, Brendan Gleeson as Beowulf's faithful friend Wiglaf--basically just lend their voices, not their faces and bodies to the story.  If you watch the bonus features and see just how little of the action wasdone by live actors, you'll wonder why they didn't just release it as animation.  But again, it is highly watchable, and some of the action scenes are impressive, particularly the last segment with the fire-breathing dragon.  And the ending is wonderful--the dead Beowulf put out to sea in a burning boat, as in the epic--but here there is a kind of O. Henry twist that makes it even more interesting.<br /><br />Obviously this is not a chick flick, it's an adventure that will appeal mostly to men--or, more accurately, to boys of all ages.  Due to the language and the sexuality, I can't recommend it for kids, although it's probably no worse than prime-time television.

B0002XNSY0|5.0|I remember watching this movie near the end of the Cold War and wondering just how daring the film was when it came out back in the mid-sixties.  Probably made a lot of people nervous because the prospect of something like this occuring was probably very much in the minds of filmgoers.<br /><br />I think the greatest parts of the film are poking at the president for knowing nothing of a bill he himself signed into legislation, or how the politicians speak to each other like nervous lovers.  Of course, all that pales to Ripper's running fear of flouride finding its way into his \\"precious bodily fluids.\\"  What about the fear of  a Mine-Shaft Gap?<br /><br />Great film, but it may be lacking a bit in the a younger viewer's eye, as the very real fears prevelant at the time probably seem comical by contemporary times.

I admire the way she studies her topic, conducts interviews, and learns all she can about the material in her book before she writes it.  Her books are not merely interesting and well-written, but very true to life and educational.  In Nineteen Minutes, she helps the reader to understand the depths of despair some students feel and the pain and anguish their parents feel when their teenager is driven to commit an unspeakable crime, which affects the lives of so many students and parents in the community. Picoult helps the reader to feel the horror of events like Columbine and other school shootings - from the viewpoint of both the victims and the shooter.

B000BTGY1O|5.0|What started out as a seedy and truncated tale of a would-be New York socialite in print, turned out to be a much grander and unforgettably intoxicating film. Truman Capote seems to have been going for a Holden Caulfield with a crush, with the original short story. Anybody that's read the novella, definitely comes away feeling that Capote was reaching for the literary stars with it, but in an all too obvious way. Equally reaching though, was the screenplay adapted by George Axelrod, a Hollywood scribe who hadn't yet written his big hit, and surprisingly followed this film up with the much darker `Manchurian Candidate'. But strangely, and for the fortune of a fool, it works, and it works well ... and in both mediums. The story and the film are unconventional in its time, place and alongside its peers.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn was, in my mind, in an even greater classic film: `Charade', with a much more endearing performance as well, but most of us will always remember her as Holly Golightly with the orange cat. Holly seems like the girl that a lot of men would want to be with but won't admit. The proposition she puts to the book's Mr. Bell is to:<br /><br />\\"Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell ... That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.\\"<br /><br />Holly was a contrast of a character for a time now vanished, when women were supposed to be less than their parts and quiet, too. Holly was anything but the locked-in house-frau of old America. In both versions, her past, `Doc', comes to pull her away from her independent life and remove her to lesser experiences and lesser moments, lost and wasted on an older man's desire.<br /><br />Maybe Capote was saying much more than what we've given him credit for with Breakfast at Tiffany's. Maybe he was really speaking about the longing of the soul, the desperation of will, set deep within a person almost unreachable, untreatable. Maybe he was speaking to all women; women feeling carefully stitched into unbelievably cruel and untenable situations like a fourteen year old wife to a much older man on some far away farm. Or maybe he was speaking to all men. Men, who are in grey moments fading fast and isolated, wanting to reach out for some young beauty, some young prize to remind them of someone else, also long faded; older men that would wreck a young girls life unknowingly, just to fill an unquenchable need.<br /><br />It's difficult to say what Capote was thinking and what he was shooting for. But watching the film and reading the book, the underlying theme is hard to block out and ignore. Hopefully, I'll keep the youthful indifferent perspective of a Paul Varjak, and not the lustful and slobbery gaze of a Doc Golightly or a Rusty Trawler.on an older man's desire.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Once more, Michael Moore uncovers the uncomfortable truth and overturns the arrogant self-satisfied complaisense that characterize America's inflated view of itself.  We are on a slide not only to mediocrity in so many vital areas but may be beyond recall in the collective power of vested interests and their puppy dog media that have devastated the human heart of this nation.  As Moore makes abundantly clear, we are not citizens of the Earth, we are isolated and blinded by hype, we believe the very persons who destroy the values upon which Jeffereson, Madison, and Franklin build this nation.  We are a nation of 'me's,' and our minimalist interest in 'we' is tribal and childish.<br /><br />How does a nation remain so blind?  Perhaps the freedom of the press has taken an Orwellian flip and become the freedom from the Truth.  Under the cynical guise of 'family values' we have destroyed our human family and made a rotton, corrupting heap of any true values in human life.  BushChenCo lead the lemmings to their own destruction, and their prod is fear, fear, fear.....<br /><br />Yes, Michael.  Keep on.  But also give us hope.  We seem trapped more and more in the deadly spider web which ever more tightly binds us to the powers of death.  The BushChenCo politburo has undermined our confidence and convinced our young that nothing they do can change things. But the only changes of any signicance in history have come from a few.  We can only hope this change is peaceful, loving, and free--not the bloddthirsty spectable of Madness disguised as Statesmanship.<br /><br />Only Dennis Kucinich has spoken to these issues, and large media chose to eliminate him and his voice from the campaign by muscling him out of open debate. Dennis tells too much truth in this Orwellian state. Newspeak, we have arrived.<br /><br />Bob Sauerbrey
B000U1ZV8K|4.0|If you are fan of Action films,then this boxset is for you.It's got all the movies in great audio and video...although the DVD's are the old versions,and don't contain any special features other than theatrical trailers.All of them are basically bare-bones DVD's,and if the special features matter,then you shouldn't buy this item.But for $10.50,you could'nt ask for more bang for a buck (quite literally) !
B00139B39E|3.0|the reason why i am giving three stars is actually split in 2 thoughts: the first cd deserves 4 stars and the second 2 stars. the first one was quite good there were good songs i liked expect i disliked that they edited the great songs and skipping most of the intro's and i missed long length songs like The Glass Prison, a Change of Seasons and Octavarium. if there wasn't enough room to place these songs then just release a 3 cd compilation. anyway on to the second cd which i think deserves only 2 stars. it's a cd full of ballads now don't get me wrong i love songs like: Solitary Shell, I walk beside you and Answer lies Within. but you don't just put all the ballads on 1 disk balads are there for some relaxing and chilling down. I don't want to be chilled down al the time. I want to freak out on the skills of John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy, but i didn't get the chance to. Therefore my 3 stars in total
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is easily one of the best drama/crime series I have watched in some time.  Mix one-part serial killer with elements of any popular crime series drama, a bit of dark comedy and it will have you glued to your TV tube for hours.<br /><br />I subscribe to Showtime primarily to watch The Tudors, another great Showtime series (although quite different) and started watching season one of Dexter out of boredom one night.  I will admit the pilot started off a little slow for me, but after a few episodes I was completely hooked.  Now thanks to Showtime on-demand I've watch all of season one and most of season two in a matter of a few days.  Maybe I need to get a life, but I can't turn it off.<br /><br />Not for the squeamish, but otherwise highly recommended.
B000002OX7|5.0|One of the most essential of the Amazon \\"essential recordings\\", a candidate for greatest rock and roll album of all time - millions upon millions of words have been written about these songs to which I can't really add much except for one element of them that isn't captured on this CD.    While of course the music stands on its own merit, the most famous of these songs contain a profundity, a theatricality, a majesty and a drama (REAL DRAMA, not melodrama) that was not completely fulfilled until they were performed live (the only comparison that comes to my mind is Springsteen with \\"Rosalita\\" and \\"Badlands\\"). When The Who were at their performing peak, \\"Baba O'Reilly\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" were not only the most thrilling moments in the history of live rock performances, they were the most meaningful moments in the history of English-language popular music.    Tragically, the biggest hole in the Who's recorded legacy are the concerts where the Who's Next songs became the centerpiece. We have the soundstage show from \\"The Kids Are Alright\\", the out-of-print [[ASIN:B0001B0U2Q The Who Rocks America 1982]] videotape and precious little else - even the marvelous crowd dynamic you see with \\"The Concert for New York City\\" can't make up for the already obvious fading of Roger's voice. I don't have a good feel for the bootlegs, and I'm not sure I can even bring those up on Amazon anyway.    What these songs really mean isn't going to be known until people get to hear the way they were done onstage - I'm hoping whoever reads this will use the comments to help younger Who fans get to experience what I did.
B00005JO1R|5.0|At the time this was in the movies i was unable to go see it, but i just happened upon it on tv yestarday and was intantly hooked. What really struck me was how much Joaquin Phoenix looked like Johnny Cash. his facial expressions, voice and mannerisms i thought were spot on. at times it was like looking at a young Cash. amazing! he is a fabulous actor. he should have won the oscar. i am buying this right now and it will go in with my all time favorite movies. big thumbs up!
B00132D808|3.0|I am going to start out by saying this.  Panic(!) At The Disco is one of my top 5 favorite bands.  I love Brendon's voice.  And after their debut came out, I called Ryan Ross my favorite lyricist.  I bought \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" after only hearing \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" a few times, and hearing samples of the last 4 tracks at Borders.  I played the album and fell in love with it straight off.  It became my favorite album as well.  The sound was different, the lyrics catchy, and it was just so clever.  So I was looking forward to them releasing a second album.  When I first heard the first single from \\"Pretty. Odd.,\\" \\"Nine in The Afternoon,\\" I wasn't impressed at first, but it grew on me.  So I was curious about what the album was like. . .     Then I played it.  And I was very dissappointed.  My reaction was, \\"What the hell?  What band changes their sound in their second album?!\\"  P.O. had none of the appeal of AFYCSO.  In fact, if this was their first album, I wouldn't have bought it.  I pry wouldn't have even liked them.  Fever had a darker sound, and I love that.  The lyrics were so great, and it was music I could dance to and really get in to.   I'm not a fan of the Beatles, but after listening to them a bit, saw Panic really wanted to be like them.  And that blows, cause Panic was so unique before.  They also had that whole \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" look, and considering how much I love that, the fact that they dropped, kinda pisses me off.  I really wonder what is next for Panic.  They go from a 1930s look w/ a different sound, to the 1960s Beatles.  What's next? 1990s grunge?  Are they gonna sound like Nirvana next and wear flannel?   Seriously, I wish they'd return to the way they looked and sounded before.  I get their whole, \\"We matured, but we're still the same band.\\"  That's a bit of a lie.  They are 2 years older, not 10.    I did buy the deluxe edition, which is worth it cause of all the awesome things you get with it.  I am not gonna give them only 1 star, but anything above 3 is a joke.  I can see why NITA was the first song released; it is the only great song on the album, though still can't compare to anything on Fever.  You don't change your sound.  I kinda question if I'll even play this album again.  I've played it 3 times, and still I cannot get into it.  Luckily, I own Fever, and that is where the good stuff is.
0880794968|3.0|I am particularly in agreement with the reviewer who states, \\"To me reading them was like trying to absorb road directions from an incoherent person who was hitting you over the head with a board!\\"  regarding the original Rider Waite.  I never really liked the original because of the strange colors and the bizarre expressions the characters all have!  Additionally, the horses are really badly drawn, and as a horse-woman, I find that very annoying.  The smoother style of the Universal deck resolves these problems pretty well (although I still wonder if the horse in the 6 of wands is a pantomime horse!)  This is not my favorite deck, but I do use it about once a week, and I find it pleasant.
B00034EOKA|5.0|The book arrived in awesome condition and it is a classic I never had the opportunity to read in younger years.    I thoroughly enjoyed this family and their lives.      A marvelous read; everyone should be required to read this wonderful, heartfelt story.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I'm sorry, but I just gotta say this. MARS VOLTA DO NOT SOUND LIKE RUSH. I keep reading this. The ONLY connection to Rush are his somewhat similar vocals. There is nothing musically equivalent, besides being a prog band. Anyone who compares them to Rush is a moron. Both bands are excellent in thier sounds.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I have been a sg-1 fan since the first episode and could not wait to get my hands on a copy of the ark of truth and i was not dissapointed it is a must have for your collection.
0525950079|3.0|There are parts of World Without End that are captivating, and you can't wait to read what happens next. But too often, you will have to wait seemingly forever. This would make a great summer read when you have a couple of days or weeks to devote to reading this 1,100-page tome. Because there are chapters separating characters' exploits, if you read a chapter an evening, you may not remember who did what to whom two chapters ago.<br /><br />I can't explain it better than that. While \\"Pillars\\" held my interest to the point where I couldn't put it down - even though the narrative if the same and definitely Follett - this seemed drawn out. Perhaps in the 17 years between volumes, I've gotten much older and want things to happen faster, but there's a fine line between meticulous and drawn out.<br /><br />World Without End is fascinating from the standpoint of the accurate picture it paints of life in the 15th Century, but it could have been told more quickly unless Follett felt that the book had to stand on its own for those who didn't read Pillars.<br /><br />So, sometimes a 5, sometimes a 2, and while I hate \\"averages,\\" the book would come out to 3.5-stars. On the other hand, if you've loved all of Follett's previous works, you'll love this one, too.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|If you have never seen this Kurosawa classic, and have seen and enjoyed The Magnificent Seven, this movie is a must for your collection.

0452289963|5.0|this book \\"the new earth\\" is a very enlightening book.  Eckert states things in a easy to understand way.  He makes you really think of things in your life in a very different way.  I've learned a lot from reading this book.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I started looking for this alblum after seeing Jethro Tull in Mobile, Alabama. They were great! Itunes had a partial album availible but it was missing \\"My God\\" which for me was like missing a front tooth. The CD has extra cuts on it including an interview which was interesting. I could do a side be side comparison of the origanal to the CD but I wolud thik the CD has to be cleaner.
B000OVLBHG|3.0|I was about to buy Blu-ray if there's any, but found out that it was not released yet so I just bought the newest DVD cut. Actually Sony had it HD telecine and the picure and sound quality is very impressive.    Whether or not I like Paul's movie making, this one has a lot of violence which I like.
0689859414|5.0|My grandson is in the middle of reading the Spiderwick Chronicle series.  He was very excited to get this book as it gives details about the characters he's reading about.
0783225849|5.0|This is the original and no other can come close to it! Psycho was based on the book but Alfred Hitchcock turned it into a real suspense thriller! A woman embezzles 40,000 from her job, runs away, and encounters a psycho path running an old motel. She ends up missing and those who try to locate her find out about the history of the the infamous Norman Bates, his mother, and their sinister looking house and motel. Psycho is definitely a movie to watch if u haven't seen it yet like I did as a child, and the sequels and prequels too. Thumbs up Sir Alfred Hitchock! The remake was a joke! Can't top Hitch! This DVD has the original trailers and the making of Psycho as well as other extras on it. Good job!
B0016BP0PW|1.0|I couldn't believe how horrid this film was.  I went in not expecting much because nothing can be what The Beatles were or are.  But when they started introducing new characters with any name they could pull from a song regardless of what the song was about I couldn't believe it!  Prudence, Sadie, Jude, Lucy, JoJo?  Are you kidding me?<br />I didn't care for the covers, the story was just about as thrown together as you could get.  Some of the imagery was interesting, but the song placement was disorienting and sometimes downright boring.  I went with a friend who knew I was a The Beatles fan, and when we left the theatre he just looked at me, and I just looked back.  What do you say?  I wanted to like the movie, I really did.  It should have been one more way to celebrate The Beatles.<br />If you need modern day The Beatles interpretation, go see LOVE, the Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas.  Now that is The Beatles.
B0000X61UU|5.0|This is my favourite workout. It is great because engages all the body parts and at the end it has a relaxing stretch - very important part after every workout. This program tones and fits the body exactly in a way a healthy woman's body should be. I saw results immediately after the first time i did it. After couple of weeks working with the program my body felt and looked great. I have been using Cindy's workout for the last 10 years and it works!
B00005JPTK|2.0|A semi interesting Movie thats somewhat depressing and boring until bam the ending happens.Really not very interesting until the contrived ending.            Nobody is in New York City except Rabid Humans and Will Smith and his Dog until much later someone hears his radio and  one human comes to save the planet.                Seem simple doesn't it ? It was .
0375751513|4.0|It will be a while before I forget this book. Dorian teaches me a very important lesson:<br /><br />You can never escape the consequences of evil and regardless of how fortunate you are in some areas of your life, there are always lurking in our souls those moments of shame and regret.<br /><br />I know that the book has many messages about narcissism, beauty, art, conscience, friendship, social classes and other topics, but Dorian's inability to shake his evil actions is what I will remember the most.
0375805613|3.0|I bought this for my 20 month old and he just isn't that interested yet.  He doesn't get the humor or the anticipation yet.  I will hand on to it until he is older.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This is an excellent re-release. The liner notes are a bound book, and have quite interesting sections from many people associated with the production of Joshua Tree, often explaining the background information for songs. Listening to the album again with the new-found backstories brings new meaning and weight to many of the songs. The concert is quite enjoyable, bringing back memories of what used to be... stylish. Very entertaining. The documentary is also fascinating.     (I bought this without knowing anything about it, so I can't comment on that.)
B0014DBZT2|5.0|I'm not writing much on this album.    Its fantastic, hilarious, brutal and thats it..    go listen.
B00008NRI8|5.0|I bought this Film for the Sandra Bullock appeal.Any other addition is a plus.The relationship with Hugh Grant works because of Sandra's Charisma. It helps that the supporting actors are top notch.And The work with the   Director/writer in Ms Congeniality is spoken of in negative terms here in reviews, well, I loved Ms Congeniality, so that connection was and is a plus for me. I enjoyed the film  from start to finish, and the commentary shows where Hugh did some \\"ad lib\\"  work, and it is quite fun.The bottom line here is that if you like Sandra, then you will like thye film, if not then any excuse to bag the film will do. So, Pick a film you like and review that one.  The DVD is quite good, the Bonus elements provide great extra materials that add to the film  and has a special extra that when accessed shows some behind the scenes extras( And the best ones come on an alternate path where a Heart shows up, and it shows \\"bloopers\\" and a bunch of fun material that adds to the enjoyment of the film after several views...but, I could re-view without this feature anyway :-). Anyways, as a variation on one of my favorite saying \\"Any Sandra is Good Sandra\\"...  ENJOY
0805079831|5.0|I was literally blown away by the quality of the research and the writing that went into this book. The quality of Naomi Kleins mind is so pervasive throughout the analysis that I was considering ditching my bachelorhood and trading up into the world of the superior intellect. Then I found that she is already taken.<br />This book is a stunning critique of the biggest jerk that ever imprinted the schools of economics, Milton Friedman. While taking a capstone economics course at a prestigious university I was given a handout one day. The title of the piece was \\"Only Money Matters\\". The author was Milton Friedman. I considered his theory for a few minutes. That meant that selling lives for $100 was smart economics.<br />There are plenty of powerful people, (Rockefeller & Kissinger & Cheney & Rumsfeld to name a few stalwarts) who have spent decades showing that extracting $100 with the ruination of a human being was simply good business. Milton Friedman was their biggest cheerleader.<br />Friedman is now gone and the world is a better place. His doctrine of complete and utter selfishness has finally been shown to be nothing more than complete and utter selfishness. Too bad that millions had to die. Unfortunate that millions lost their jobs. Sad that millions lost their homes. Luckless that thousands committed suicide in the wake of the triumvirate of Friedman, the IMF, and the multi national corporation.<br />Happily, the world is waking up. Those who cheer for benevolence and sanity hope that it fully awakens before the master planners kill it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have never been a Britney fan but I've got to give her 2 thumbs way up for Blackout! She has 6 really great songs on this CD and the others, while not great are still good.    The music is fresh, upbeat, catchy and even the biggest Britney naysayer will find themselves movin' to Blackout!
B0013FXWU6|2.0|The performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is indeed Oscar worthy, as was his performance as Bill the Butcher in \\"Gangs of New York.\\"  I say this because the two seem to be one-and-the-same, down to the bushy mustache.  At times, this movie was tedious, and I wanted it to \\"get going.\\"  Scenes seemed to be thrown in for no reason (witness Plainview and his son in the dining room/bar when the movers and shakers from Union Oil walk in--everything said here was said in a previous scene between Plainview and the Union Oil big-wigs.)  And the ending made no sense--just because his son wanted to strike out on his own, he goes nuts and calls him every name in the book.  What happened in the \\"skipped\\" 16 years to cause this estrangement?  And no clear explanation was given why Eli Sunday deserved to be bludgeoned to death in the final scene.  Infinitely better than \\"No Country for Old Men\\" but still a disappointment.
B000060MMI|4.0|If you like bands like The Pogues, Dubliners etc. you will like this as well. Nothing really surprising or new, just good Irish folklore in \\"pub rock\\" or even punk style. Big load of energy and sentiments. Listening this, all you want to do is go to good Irish pub, collect couple pints of Guinness and probably switch to Irish whiskey later...
0307265730|5.0|Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote, \\"Human nature will not flourish, any more than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series of generations, in the same worn out soil. My children ... shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.\\" This quote, which was a revelation to me, so much so that I redid my work e-mail \\"inspiration quote\\" signature to put it it, is the inspiration of Jhumpa Lahiri's new collection of short stories called \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\".<br /><br />This is the first book I have read of hers, and it simply does not disappoint. Eight stories are so intricately woven with their words and themes that each in itself is a beautiful work of art, and yet together, form the basis of a masterpiece. Former author of [[ASIN:0006551793 Interpreter of Maladies]] and [[ASIN:0618733965 The Namesake (movie tie-in edition)]], Lahiri's carrying on her success with this new bunch. The book starts with the story named after the book, a story about a Bengali woman named Ruma and  her father who comes to visit her from Pennsylvania. Cultures and expectations collide as these two virtual strangers learn to exist with each other without the familiar glue of her mother, who passed away only months before. A garden, her mixed race son, and a secret love, permeate the layers of this opening story that literally leave you breathless by stories end. Similar themes are woven through the other seven stories, some which I liked more than others, but all of them written with such scope and craft.<br /><br />Reading a story written by Lahiri is like sitting in a well ordered, immaculate living room, with a rich, fragrant onion sitting in front of you. As you delve into the story, you peel back the layers of the onion, and the exactitude and preciseness of her stories marvel, and the scent of the onion, not bitter or harsh, but rich and alluring, fill that perfect room, so much so that by the end, all of yours senses are heightened, and you may possibly have tears in your eyes.<br /><br />It's as if Lahiri wrote her stories, and took a literary comb and brushed out all of the extra verbs, nouns, and adjectives (most which can clutter today's fiction), leaving only the essential words behind, creating an exquisite picture. People have compared Lahiri's writing to Hemingway. I sense more of Michael Cunningham, who also strives for leximic precision. Both Cunningham and Lahiri's writing is character centered, creates worlds of inner conflict, and flows like a beautiful river.<br /><br />After just reading the first story, I told five people of this marvelous new book, and highly recommend you to that if you want to marvel in the worlds created by Lahiri, this is the perfect place to start.as if Lahiri wrote her stories, and took a literary comb and brushed out all of the extra verbs, nouns, and adjectives (most which can clutter today's fiction), leaving only the essential words behind, creating an exquisite picture.

159562015X|3.0|Finding Strengths was a great book and very helpful.  The only negative I can give it is that you must have computer access.  I bought it for someone without access to a computer and he was unable to take the test at the end which was the whole point of the book.  There is no option to do a pen/paper test.
0143039504|1.0|After watching the Jane Austin Book Club, my wife and I decided to read the complete Jane Austin books to better understand the first movie.  I purchased a paperback edition from Amazon.com, which arrived in a few days. The book, published by Penguin Paperbacks, has an uneven cut in the binding. The pages stick out like it had come apart and been re-glued.  The paper, since it is a paperback, is an off white that with the small print is too hard for my aging eyes to read, although younger readers may not have a problem.  In order to read the books, I went online and found the entire series for free since it is in the public domain. I am reading the book on my laptop instead where I can increase the font size for easier reading.<br /><br />The stories, of course, are worthwhile reading.  More is understood than just what the videos on PBS and BBC shows, as is always the case when comparing books to film. But, for $[...], it is nice to have a hard copy of the books.

B00005JPTK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Will's acting in this movie because he conveyed the fear so much through his eyes. He showed a tiny hint of this in Enemy of the State, but it really shone as an overriding emotion that the Neville character had to overcome. Also, I was impressed with his slip from humanity after the loss he suffered in the middle of the movie. The descent in maddening isolation in the video store scene was excellent characterization.     This was the first time I was nervous watching a movie. I kept waiting for the jump scenes to happen, and I would tighten every muscle like I was going down the first steep drop of a roller coaster ride. It was an awesome.    I know people found the infected people cheesy, but that is because they were misled into thinking that they were supposed to be zombies. This is not Night of the Living Dead or even 28 (Days/Weeks) Later. The infected had become a super race, a no body fat, all muscle, dark-loving, voracious race. They were driven to consume by their super-fast metabolism. (Not necessarily the way I would like to lose weight.)    In my opinon, the theatrical release was in every way better than the alternative ending. It was more logical and truer to the storyline. I found that the alternative melted into a Disney happy-ending for all involved that erased the first hour and a half. What were they thinking?? It just did not make any sense to make the man-eating super race look like they were misunderstood. For all that, a dream sequence would have been more acceptable.    I would definitely recommend this movie. Thanks to all involved.
B000683VI4|2.0|This movie is very hopeless romantic, predictable. All in all, i found the movie to be BORING! Why? Just because it's so silly, and the story line wasn't all that great. I could fall asleep throughout the whole movie. I personally thought A walk to Remember was 10x better!
B00104QSOM|4.0|Although this is one of the best films of the 21st Century, the special features on this \\"collector's edition\\" are almost not worth the space that the extra disc takes up in my DVD folder.  The \\"Dailies Gone Wild\\" is one shot that merely continues until \\"cut\\" is called and you get to see Daniel D-L smile.  Great.  The \\"'Fishing' Sequence\\" is merely an extended version of the one already in the film.  The \\"Making of\\" is just a photographic comparison of how well the production design matches real photos from back in the day.  And the \\"Haircut/Interrupted Hymn\\" again is an extended sequence.    Didn't watch the \\"Story of Petroleum,\\" but I also have the History Channel.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I have to admit, I did go into watching this show with a bit of dread. But boy did they do a good job of it. I think the main reason I immediately loved the show is the fantastic cast that was chosen, in particular Lena Headey as Sarah and Thomas Dekker as John.    This show immediately became my new favorite show on TV which I would not ever have predicted (CSI has been my number one for years, closely followed by Law & Order SVU).    I can't wait for Season 1 to become available on DVD and am looking forward to Season 2 (there simply has to be one, right?).
0452289963|5.0|This book is the best I've read, ever. I'm a huge Tolle fan, and I think this is his best book yet. I've also signed up for the Oprah/Tolle webcast. While I'm not a huge fan of Oprah's interviewing style (she interrupts a lot!), it's so exciting that millions of people have access to these concepts.  They're simple, yet so simple we usually miss them.   Tolle is an incredible interpreter, very skilled at pointing the way to the power we possess inside us.   I can't recommend this book enough. Also, if you like Tolle and want to REALLY GET what he's saying, with no interruptions, rent The Flowering of Human Consciousness from Netflix, or wherever you can find it. In fact, I think I'll go right now and order my own copy here on Amazon! Excellent!!!  Roshana
B0012Y22KO|2.0|It's really unusual for me to buy a box set that has just been released, as I usually wait until I see it used and then buy it.  But I've been wanting to get the old Toto records for a while now, and when I saw this I thought it was perfect, because I didn't have any of them on CD as of yet and thought it would be a great space saving solution (as was the Queensryche \\"Revolution Calling\\" box set).  The drummer in my swing band is a Jeff Porcaro fan, so we split the cost so she could download all the tracks and listen to Jeff and I could have the little baby Toto collection.    Having just received it in the mail, I really would only recommend it for people who are in my situation and are either looking to save space and/or don't own these albums yet.  Here's an overview:    --Not remastered.  They sound OK for what I'm needing but I can hear the lack of bass and slightly tinny sound of a late 80's digital mastering job.  I remember \\"Mushanga\\" being a lot warmer sounding on vinyl, for example.  --Crappy artwork on the mini-sleeves.  The cover of \\"Hydra\\" and the painting on \\"Fahrenheit\\" have that infamous diamond-textured look that you'll get if you don't scan something correctly. The \\"Toto IV\\" front cover is BLOCKY with a capital \\"B\\"!  It looks like they took it off a 72 dpi scan made for the Internet (no kidding!)--it really looks awful.  A couple of times (as in \\"Toto IV\\" and \\"The Seventh One\\") they try to approximate the vinyl packaging (with inferior scans of course), but many times, as with \\"Hydra\\", it looks like they are looking off the old CD's rather than the vinyl.  It's a pretty amateur-looking hack job that I could do myself with Photoshop (with the possible exception of \\"Turn Back\\" which looks pretty good).  Makes me wish I had kept my Toto vinyl for the artwork.  --The DVD of \\"Greatest Hits Live and More\\" (formerly \\"Toto Live\\" on VHS). The concert is well-edited and was recorded at Le Zenith in Paris on October of 1990.  This DVD comes with a couple of interesting extras.  One extra is an interview with the band that Jeff Porcaro dominates that was shot in Holland in 1988 and is interspersed with clips of their old music videos.  The other is a Behind the Scenes promo for the \\"Tambu\\" album from 1995, which is fun.  This DVD is available separately, as all of you Toto fans know.  It's a fun disc, but everything looks like it's taken from VHS masters.  --A flimsy, bare bones 12-page booklet with credits for the songs and some short recollections from David Paich on each of the albums.  Interesting, but nothing to kill for, as it fills one page with gaps to spare.    I hope this helps all you Toto fans who are wondering what's in this box.  Don't rebuy everything if you don't have to.  If you like having the Mini LP sleeves, don't buy it for that either because they look really bad.  Only buy it if you do not have the albums already, as was my situation.      --David Gasten
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is one of the best shows that I have ever watched and the blu-ray quality is amazing.
B00104QSOM|1.0|I won't be buying this DVD for the packaging they put it in.  It's a disgrace for the serious collector, worse than snap cases and that's saying something!  -kd5-
B00011RPB0|5.0|My favorite movie to date. A very personal movie to me. Great music and you can't beat Bill Murrey. What a gas!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have always been a nature lover and lover of nature programmes, especially those of the great David Attenborough. When \\"Planet Earth\\" came out I knew what to expect because it was the same team that did \\"Blue Planet\\", and yet, it still managed to take my breath away.    The imagery alone is mind-bogglingly magnificent and worth five times the prive of the DVDs. As a photographer myself, I often found myself truly and utterly amazed at the skill and dedication of the cameramen involved in this series. Those pictures alone are enough to make one feel the small, insignificant, tiny speck of dust on the face of our great and wonderful planet that one really is. On top of this the sound is world class and really helps to support the majestic feel of our nature, that the imagery so perfectly displays. The narration by Attenborough is the clincher. The familiar sound of, perhaps THE nature documentarist, is icing on the cake. Wonderful icing though.     To make an already lenghty review slightly less long than it could be, I'll say this: \\"Planet Earth\\" inspires, captivates, spellbinds, strikes you with awe (not the sadly overused teenager 'awesome', but the proper God fearing kind of awe), and makes you fall absolutely and utterly in love with the earth on which we are so fortunate to live our lives.    Highest possible recommendation.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a fan of all of the Stargates this was an excellent story that tied up loose ends yet still left the possibilty for future stories. Very well done. Bring back General O'Neill!
B000R7HY0K|3.0|Let me start out by saying, that I am not a fan of the horror/grindhouse genre, and thus might take to this with a less than perfect attitude. I am, however, an admirer of Quentin Tarantino. I don't worship the ground he treads as so many of his devoted fans do, but I usually like what he does with films (although I think there is a very, very thin line between homage and plain copying at times), especially on the sound side.    \\"Death Proof\\" is not among my favourite films though. Kurt Russel is nothing short of amazing as stuntman Mike, the homicidal and death defying petrolhead picking up girls in bars. The rest of the cast also acts well, no doubt about it, and there is a few bits of decent action thrown in the mix as well, but the story is simply too boring. I belong to the crowd who think it is slow, dull, and not at all witty. This, however, may be an added effect of watching it in the cinema right after the actionfilled and hugely amuzing, over the top Rodriguez film \\"Planet Terror\\", but I think that even when watched on its own, \\"Death Proof\\" is still a bit bland. The slow pace with which the story unfolds and the concomitant desire to yawn is not entirely justified by the action sequences in the latter third of the movie, which would've been the only reasonable way for this film to redeem itself. Sadly it doesn't happen.     If you are a fan of the genre or, to use a pathetic and utterly silly, yet popular term, a Tarantino fanboy, I think you might like it better than I did. It's definitely not without potential, but it is just not good enough.
B000FVRACK|5.0|It's a delight to see Rubinstein at his 90ths playing three magistral piano concerts. The peaceful way that Rubinstein plays the Chopin's concert is a special moment in this DVD. Another important point is the youth Andre Previn conducting the London Symphony Orchestra masterfully.
B000053ZRR|5.0|Bon Jovi's Crush tour DVD is full of great songs, behind the scenes action, interveiws and one heck of a stage show! John and the band rock! Richie plays his guitar with his usual flawless ease and He and John sound awesome together as always! Kudos to all the gents in the Band!<br /><br />  Kathleen.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|I was not really familiar with this story, but I watched anyway when it was broadcast on television.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I was quite charmed by the simple story, and by the main character (who was quite unlike anything I expected to find in a story from that time period).<br /><br />The costumes in this particular film were also quite lovely.  As with all of these Jane Austen productions, the quality and look of the films is top-notch.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|Like was this a true story or what?  Like life is hard and then you die.  Yeah.  We know that.  The main character, daniel day-lewis,  talks like a robot.  Why does he always sleep on the hard wooden floor?  We were shown him there twice.  Is this a true story?  Yeah he gets rich from oil and he hates religious people so he gets to kill one of them.  The most interesting part of this story is the deaf child who learns to sign and moves out of the realm of the wack job who is the main character.  The \\"extra features\\" on the second disk do nothing to clarify why these things happened.  Neither does the dvd jacket.  I dont even know who played what roles.  The jacket has no information.  Save your money.  This film is just as inscrutable as the reason gas is now so expensive at the pump.  Baloney. Good thing this never happened in real life because its idiotic.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I was not familiar with this story at all before watching this adaptation.  But I did enjoy it quite a bit.  The production quality was very good, the costumes were lovely, and the casting was excellent.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000I5XOW8|2.0|I've noticed various reviews here have stated that the video quality was impressive. Personally I was quite disapointed.    This was the first Blu-ray I purchased and frankly I was disappointed with the video quality. I realize the film is never going to look as sparkling and clean as more recent films, but the image quality seemed lacking.     It has a soft, washed out 'milky' look and the detail is off and on. Sometimes the close-ups on faces are impressive, but then it will cut to a city shot at night and I really noticed the lack of definition.     Of course much of this flatness comes from the fact that the photography was fairly dull in the first place (the whole film has a 'grey' look), but I still expected something more impressive on the Blu-ray format.    Also the sound is not HD or PCM. It comes with the same audio as the previous DVD.    So my advice, if you only want to collect Blu-rays with superb video & audio quality, this is NOT one of them. But, if you are simply a fan of the film and want the best quality version available, then this is still your best bet.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved the book when I first read it more than 10 years ago.  I've since seen a number of productions based on the book, but this one is my favourite.  It is just beautiful.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the story (or even if you're not), I highly recommend this adaptation.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|To me, science fiction must deal with how people cope in a world different from ours. (Or how do aliens deal with our world.) Without a sympathetic character to walk with, I get lost in a haze of techno babble and lose interest.     Since this book, by the title, is about war, I was afraid it would be all lazer guns and technical details. I was happy to find it was just the opposite. Enough tech details to explain the circmustances, and a real person to relate to.    Some may want the main character to spend more time questioning the causes of eternal war and his role in it, but it would have been out of character. He enlisted, he had a job to do, and he did it. He faces some truths about himself. Circumstances force him to change and in that change he discovers talents he was unaware he had and also discovers some things he's not comfortable admitting about himself. He's a believable and interesting character.    The aliens and the technology are handled well. Since this book is not about alien society, we don't get much of that. I would like more, but we don't need it for this book.    I enjoyed this book from page one bought the second book immediatly.     If you want a good human  character in an alien world, you can't go wrong with this book.
0767020308|2.0|I watched this adaptation on television.  I thought that I would enjoy it (I had enjoyed the theatrical version with Gwyneth Paltrow), but I was mistaken.  This one just couldn't hold my interest, and I was watching the clock throughout, waiting for the whole boring mess to be over with.  It's only been a couple of weeks since I watched it, and I can barely remember anything that happened.  I guess it really couldn't hold my attention!<br /><br />I can't comment on whether or not it was a faithful adaptation from the book.  When I tried to read it a few years ago, I got bored and never finished.  Having recently watched six adaptations of the Jane Austen works on Masterpiece Theatre, I can say that, for me, \\"Emma\\" is the weakest of the bunch.
B0013FBTHO|4.0|This seems like the last HD-DVD to be issued by Warners since they'll be pulling the plug as of June.  Too bad because this disc boasts superb visuals & sound.  Smith should have been at least nominated for a Golden Globe or Oscar but I guess the committees don't appreciate good sci-fi. This film is superior to the 1971 version with Charlton Heston (RIP). If any of you still have a HD-DVD, do get this one before Warners withdraws its HD version from the catalog. Have already seen the Blu-ray version from Netflix and there's no difference. Also the alternate ending is interesting but implausible so stick with the theatrical version!!
B000RZIGYU|5.0|The movie is a great concept, well executed. It looks better than I've seen it in a long time. The best part is, the movie holds up. It is still entertaining. The following link is to the review I read before purchasing this HD DVD film.    [...]    My only warning is HD DVD is over.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|I have been waiting for a decent film transfer of this movie since the original DVD which was non-letterbox stereo.  Boy did that one suck.  I am sure the 2001 DVD release re-mastered from HD and 5.1 audio was much better.  But I waited for this one and it's 100x better.  The menu is cool but would have been even better with a faster interface response like HD-DVD provided.  Let's hope Java-BD offers better menu speed/quality/consistency that all of us were used to on HD-DVD.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|I saw this movie at a friends house. Several people were there and we all had mixed reviews. Most of the people there said they were ok with it but they would never watch it again... But we found that after a few weeks we were still thinking about it. It has a great Alien-esque feel. The third act changes things up and I think that's what threw everyone off. So, I would say watch it first. Let it sit. Then if you're still thinking about it in a few weeks, pick it up.

B000TT1QLE|5.0|Angela Hewitt is a star - the Well Tempered Klavier Book I and II are complete and wonderful She has amazing phrasing and technique.

B00005JLEU|2.0|What am I missing? I like Miyazaki's movies. But this one does not make any sense. It is all about the STORY, there is none here. Instead, it is suggestive. You could cut out any half-hour of the movie without altering it. Great art, no story
B000001FS3|5.0|This album contains many of people's favorite U2 songs - this is my favoite album (and I have all of them). Highly recommended!
B00019074O|4.0|There certainly isn't much light I can shed on Police Academy.  Anybody who was old enough to watch a movie in the 80s is familiar with this film as well as it's many sequels(and lets not forget animated and live action TV series.  Well, it's probably a good idea to forget the live action series).  The story of a bunch of goofballs(let into the academy due to a new rule put forth by the mayor which allows anybody to join) and their shenanigans are stuff of legend.  Characters like Hightower, Jones, Mahoney, Lassard, and Tackleberry are pretty much household names.<br />I've always liked this movie.  Sure, it's all pretty juvenile and not every joke is a winner, but what can you do?  Some of the stuff is still pretty damn funny, a lot of the best gags going to Michael Winslow.  Winslow isn't featured in this one as much as he would be in the sequels.  And lets not forget the podium scene and the infamous Blue Oyster Bar(which is personally my favorite part of the first four movies).  A young and very tasty looking Kim Cattrall is here, but she really doesn't have much to do but look cute, and she doesn't really seem to generate much chemistry with Guttenberg.  No big deal, this is slapstick not a romance.<br />Watching these films is always a nice trip down memory lane for me, so thanks for bearing with me.  The 20th Anniversary edition DVD has a nice 30+ minute documentary that has interviews with director Hugh Wilson, producer Paul Maslansky, and a good number of the cast.  Well worth the very reasonable asking price.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Great movie, wish there were more extras, but the movie is the important part, and it's a modern classic.
0805079831|5.0|\\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is a must-read for anyone who wants to get a clearer picture about what the US has done in Iraq relating to the 2003 invasion, from an economic perspective. The book begins decades before, from the lens of  Milton Friedman and his advocates' approach to laissez faire, free-trade corporatist economics and government's role in making it happen.<br /><br />She does seem to come from a viewpoint as seeing free trade, etc mostly just punishing the less fortunate. It should be noted that Milton Friedman did advocate a negative income tax to replace welfare. So, it is not that he and some of his advocates are either totally misguided or heartless. However, there are indeed excesses by many in powerful positions who really are either misguided or heartless or both.<br /><br />From tsunamis to Hurricane Katrina to changes in government in Chile, the Soviet Union, Argentina, etc and the 'shock and awe' in Iraq, there are people with power who either wait for or effect some cataclysm to panic everyday people to accept what is really not in their best interest and looks to reward the well-connected.<br /><br />I'll just mention a few things from the book which come to mind and I feel noteworthy:<br /><br />1. The author uses the term, 'useful crisis', like with the Canadian debt crisis in the 90's, to create a sense of panic to justify potential cuts to social programs. This term is appropriate in generalizing what has happened around the world in different situations.<br /><br />2. Donald Rumsfeld was a board member of ASEA Brown Boveri, the Swiss firm that sold nuclear technology to North Korea. Interesting!<br /><br />3. Rumsfeld was Chairman of the Board of Gilead Sciences, maker of Tamiflu, the preferred treatment for bird flu, setting up Gilead to make tons of money as the government which he became a part of, then stockpiled the drug while Americans were warned of a possible mass outbreak of the disease. When Rumsfeld left the government, the value of the Gilead stock he still owned had gone up 807%. Interesting!<br /><br />4. The 2006 Defense Authorization Act grants the president the power to employ the armed forces, overriding the wishes of state governments during a 'public emergency' which could include hurricane, mass protest or public health situation. Previously, the president could only invoke martial law in case of insurrection.<br /><br />5. US orchestrated foreign coups seeking to protect corporate favorites, can sometimes try to sell the coup because the country is being alien to  Americans simply because it is alien to an American company and thereby trying to undermine the US.<br /><br />6. Paul Bremer, given the responsibility to remake Iraq, enacted a 15% flat tax and allowed foreign companies to own 100% of the profits in Iraq, not re-invest in Iraq and not be taxed. Plus, 40 year leases for foreign investors so any future Iraqi governments would be stuck with the deals.<br /><br />7. The author reminds the reader of what the political scientist, Michael Wolf, had to say that conservatives never govern well because they believe that government, itself, is bad.  Surely not always true, but it is certainly a thought to keep in mind when evaluating a conservative candidate for office.<br /><br />8. The White House ignored most of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations except to now allow companies like Shell and BP to get long oil leases and keep most of the profits, something not even Bremer permitted, effectively keeping millions of Iraqis in perpetual poverty.<br /><br />This book is well documented with references and definitely a must-read.up 807%.

0618918248|4.0|For those that find themselves offended or brutalized by Dawkins fearless and straightforward writing, he is merely fighting fire with fire.  Although I believe this isn't a good technique that will convert the truly religious, I feel he has no responsibility to dish out the bible's dirt with care, or clean up its bloody pages like so many other non-believing writers do.  The bible, particularly the first testament, is brutal and grotesque and Dawkins makes no attempt to clean up its equally as cruel history.  However, the name calling and bitterness expressed by Dawkins will not have a persuasive affect on the fundamentalist; it could open the eyes of those who are on the fence.  Too many authors walk on eggshells when it comes to science and religion, however, Dawkins doesn't.  He launches an all out attack on religion with the aid of science, truth, and common sense.  After listening to this book and thinking about it, I must give him credit for being so bold and honest.  This book is probably not for the very religious; however for us that finds ourselves unrepresented in society and without a voice, Dawkins words will give a strong tone to the voices of those that seem to be kept silent by society.
B000LAZDQA|2.0|I purchased this movie as a gift.  It won, I believe, the GLADD award in 2007 for best film.  Excellent movie and very, very interesting as to how it was actually developed and produced.  I was incredibly frustrated when, near the end of the movie with only about 15 minutes left the DVD froze.  I found no way to advance the film even using the chapters.   Thankfully, Amazon did replace the film with another DVD.  Sadly, it froze up in the exact same spot.  Apparently there was a glitch in the production of these DVDs.  I did manage to get to the end of the film with many stops and starts.  Very distracting.
B0002B15XI|5.0|The DVD was new, worked fine. I'm perfectly happy with the purchase and delivery. Thanks!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I am a Beatles fan and I thoroughly enjoyed both the movie and the soundtrack. Several of the tracks seem like \\"unplugged\\" versions of classic Beatles songs. Others gained new life through rearrangement and the clear sweet vocals of Evan Rachel Wood.   Not every song is a home run - I wasn't very impressed with the Dana Fuchs tracks, but the album is definitely worth getting. My entire family has it on their favorites list.
0743496736|5.0|This was my favorite of the 6 Picoult books I have read: Tenth Circle, Plain Truth, Second Chance, Vanishing Act, My sister's Keeper, Keeping Faith. This is compelling and powerful. She presents more then one side of a story and this one was so meaningful, my 16 yr old niece began reading it as soon as my sister finished. I have become a strong Picoult fan recently and this one was incredible for me.
B000002UA9|5.0|This old stuff is fun to hear, you can hear them grow from one Lp or Cd to the other very raw.
1401300529|5.0|Shows the darker side of Douglas McArthur and some of his underlings.  Makes you proud of the Marine general who stood up to McArthur's staff and saved the day. I  recommend this book to any student of history.  After Inchon it was all downhill from there with McArthur and some of his self serving actions.
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|I must admit that this movie did not appeal to me when it was first released in theaters.  However, many years ago, I rented it and was captivated by the story.  Since then I've had to make do with the underwhelming DVD edition.  If you are looking for a lot of action, then this movie is probably not for you.  What it does offer is a fantastic story with a cast that gives top notch performances.  If you already own the DVD, and are not sure if this one is worth the upgrade, believe me the Blu-ray edition blows the old DVD out of the water.  The sound and picture are near perfection.  The colors on the DVD version appear washed out compared to the high def color palette.  While this movie won't give your surround system a major workout, it does provide very clear ambient surround effects.  The special features include two new short documentaries on the making of the film.  While these don't compare to some of the extras offered on other titles, they are very informative and a welcome addition to the previous version.  My one fault would be that it would have been great to have at least a good commentary track, or even a picture in picture feature.  But, because I feared that this movie would never get the treatment it so rightly deserves, I would still highly suggest you add this title to your Blu-ray collection.
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|This is meant to be a thriller with a revolutionary political message.    It fails to satisfy on both counts.    As a thriller, the anti-hero fights an evil political system, mostly for revenge for the cruelties inflicted on him, but also to bring it down. In doing so, he kills a number of figures in the system and carries out explosions to topple the state. Fair enough. But he seems invincible, almost, and the state pretty powerless, even though it is supposed to be totalitarian. V is able to distribute a very lareg number of Guy Fawkes masks undetected and to drive a train under Parliament to blow it up. No one is killed in either of these explosions, unlike in real life. Furthermore, how does the masked V supply himself with food?    Politically, this is as subversive as cold porridge. The state is a fascistic one, with an Oswald Mosley figure on top. Its homophobic and racist. How it got to power is explained by a gigantic conspiracy undetected by almost all. It fails to convince. And what happens after the overthrow of the regime? Most revolutions lead to either greater tyranny or a sordid compromise at best.  The film fails to engage here, and simply cops out. We also might wonder how why the apathetic masses suddenly risk death to overthrow the state.     This film is actually in favour of the current liberal status quo, with rights to all, though it does advocate vigiliantism and capital punishment for evildoers. But again, this is not really explored. The fascist bogeyman of the 1930s is the villain of the piece - yesterday's enemy (how daring!).     This is a film which thinks it is clever, but only in an adolescent fashion, which fails to convince on any other level. Having said that, the viewer maintains enough interest to see exactly how it will turn out, because the overthrow of the evil state is inevitable, isn't it?
0679720200|5.0|This was an amazing book, as well as an amazing translation. I loved it and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.

B000001FV1|5.0|Why isn't THIS album more popular?  I'll tell you why- by this point in the bands career, Steve Winwood was starting to run low on musical ideas for the band, and was on the verge of making a big commercial impact on the music scene going solo.  However, whatever was about to happen, doesn't affect what really DID happen, that being Winwood and the rest of the band members continuing to deliver with the creative goods for another Traffic album.      The title song rocks hard with some funkiness thrown in, \\"Roll Right Stones\\" has some spiritual vocals from Winwood and magnificent rocking segments that elevate the song to new heights (and no, the song is NOT overlong- I wish Winwood's vocals would keep going for another few minutes because they're THAT good, and on a personal note, they move me quite a bit) and \\"Tragic Magic\\" is just a really jazzy piece of melodic brilliance.  \\"(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired\\" probably shows the frustration of Winwood at the time, but doesn't interfere with the great music.  Another great song.    A classic album that's JUST as good as all the previous Traffic albums.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|The Wall the movie sure was a strange experience!  What is the movie exactly?  It's basically a bunch of scenes attached together that fit together with the music from the Pink Floyd album.  In other words, while the music is playing from the Wall album, you can see the lyrics from the songs matched together with the scenes on the screen.  Most of the scenes involve a little school boy who appears lost and confused when it comes to family and school.      My favorite scene is the same one MANY people who currently hate, or have hated in the past, the dreadfully LONG hours (and days) of going to school and learning.  Man, it really stinks to be a kid and have to do the same old routine day in and day out as far as learning and classroom assignments are concerned.  In the movie, you get to see what going to school is like through a childs eyes, and how boring it can be.    Also, another highlight of the film was all the incredibly diverse and creative animation that fit in well with the music.  A colorful tale and vision that was beautiful in every sense.  It almost looks like an amazing drug trip.  You truly have to see it to know what I mean.  Worth watching!
B0010YSD7M|2.0|Not what I expected.   And Jack's charactor wasn't in the movie which was a downer!  The TV episodes were better than this movie.
1401200605|3.0|The story is a very good tale and the art is done by Jim Lee a very talented artist. It features several of Batman's villians including my personal favorite Killer Croc. My major problem is the only way to get the whole story in one volume is the absolute edition which is ten more dollars then the two volumes put together. Other DC stories with Absolute Editions, such as Kingdom Come, you can get the whole story without buying the absolute edition.But on story and art alone I recommend but the presentation is sloppy.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Tim Burton gives us the dark side of Old London with cinematography that might just as well have used glorious B&W rather than drab color. Perhaps only the blood (of which there's plenty) could have been filmed in vivid tones of red and the rest in B&W, since this basically falls into the horror film category--with music.<br /><br />Some of Stephen Sondheim's lyrics are enormously clever and at the same time simple, except for certain songs sung by HELENA BONHAM CARTER as Mrs. Lovett, the infamous woman with a bakery shop on Fleet Street. She has some of the most difficult material to handle and she does it extremely well. JOHNNY DEPP manages to sing the part of Sweeney Todd without actually being a professional singer--so he's effective enough but one can sense how much more powerful this would have been with a real singer. Performance wise, he's fine.<br /><br />SACHA BARON CONEN is a surprise as Pirelli, demonstrating a good voice and an Italian manner that makes him sound like Stromboli from Disney's \\"Pinocchio\\". ALAN RICKMAN is as slick as ever as a cruel villain who gets his comeuppance from the devilish pair of Mrs. Lovett and Mr. Todd, as do most of the other members of the large cast.<br /><br />ED SANDERS as Toby has a nice boy soprano voice and does an excellent job of emoting, and JAYNE WISENER has a lyrical voice that suits the song she sings while gazing out the window at the film's start. All of the orchestrations sound strong and full-bodied but I can't say that any of the songs are the kind that stayed with me on a first viewing. Perhaps after a few more looks at the film, some of them will begin to stick.<br /><br />It's definitely worth watching for any fan of musicals, although you have to be prepared to expect all the blood letting--even if the gushes look a bit fake. Burton loves to depict horror with a wicked gleam in his eyes, or so it seems, and he runs the full gamut of horror right up until the final scene that has a rather shocking conclusion.<br /><br />Haven't seen the play but have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show. The film's biggest drawback is the fact that all of the photography is deliberately dark and moody, with rarely a glimpse of sunshine, and after awhile this becomes a strain on the eyes. We get the dark nature of the story from the beginning, no need to hammer the point home with an Old London atmosphere that is drearier than anything Dickens could have imagined.<br /><br />Summing up: Sondheim's score doesn't rank with his best, nor is this Tim Burton's best film--but it's well worth a watch thanks to the very energetic work of Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in difficult, very demanding roles.ut have heard Angela Lansbury do some of the songs from the Broadway show.

B000EOTTV8|5.0|Yes yes, I stole my title from another reviewer.  Hey, he wrote what I was thinking.<br /><br />You look at the blurb and you might think, \\"Wow, this has so much potential to go so wrong.\\"  But guess what?  It has just as much potential to go so right, and it certainly does.<br /><br />The writing, the acting, the character arcs, the plot and subplots...  everything is excellent.  Insightful, observant, clever, great dialogue, stellar performances from everybody.  Quite serious and quite humorous at the same time.<br /><br />I have a small shelf of movies I've seen before that I want to see again.  This one just joined the collection.
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|I love the zep. Favorite band ever. As a teen I fought for Plant when all my buddies said his new stuff was terrible and in the late eighties it was terrible (Now and Zen, Manic Nirvana). But his early stuff was damn good e.g., Pictures at eleven and Principles of Moments. Fate of nations was great and then it was of course a beautiful day when he got back together with Pagey (although Page lost his mojo in...1979?) But with this record he owns it. Fifty something years old and I mean he owns it on this record. The band smokes, the production is killin, songs are great and Plant shows up and schools you. Of course he doesn't scream like a banshee -hasn't done that since 1975 for Pete's sake. But he makes a great record here for sure -much, much better than Dreamland. Highly recommended.
B00081912E|4.0|The Mask (1994)<br />(8.5/10)<br />I wasn't going to remark on this one, but this release I just picked up surprised me. I was at the WalMart with the missus, and we passed by the bargain bin, and of course I was dragged in by it but this time she joined me. She pulled out The Mask & said \\"Why don't we ever watch this one?\\", and I said \\"Because I never bought it, I'm waiting for a newer version, that one was made around 1997, probably looks pretty bad.\\" But then she pointed out from the back that they credited \\"Lemony Snicket\\" from 2005. \\"Oh, they just updated the cover, but the disc probably is the same inside\\". Anyway she said I've bought worse for $5, so pick it up at least for our daughter, and I did.<br /><br />Glad I did it, because I was wrong! Though the covers for the two are similar, this is a brand new 2005 re-release with 4 new documentaries and a new additional commentary. The transfer's gotta be new too because it looked great. Sure, you lose the FullFrame on the flip now (good riddance), but New Line should of packaged this differently because it's almost impossible to tell that this is a new version of the DVD. And for 5 bucks it's definitely worth the double dip. Just remember, the old version has a black background behind Carrey on the cover, the new one<br />is cloud-filled blue.<br /><br />A great classic of a film that has so many firsts in it:the start of CGI becoming useful, as well as the film career starts for both Jim Carrey & Cameron Diaz (of which the extras give plenty of new attention to). After what each of them have released recently, revisiting this will remind you what potential they once had. Sad to see Richard Jeni, a talented stand-up comedian, who got his big break in this film, due to his real-life suicide 13 years later, but all together this was a fun time. Worthy of your collection (this disc version at least).

B0012EM5D8|5.0|I rented Bee Movie and plan to purchase this hilarious, sharp-witted,cute film about a bee named Barry (Jerry Seinfeld)who defies convention.  Barry is about to graduate from college to what to him is a mind-numbing life devoid of choice.  He is the only bee who questions the bee way.  His best friend Adam is content with the status quo.  Barry ventures outside and falls in love with a human named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger).<br /><br />The story is not predictable, the jokes and gags fly, and there is plenty of humor for adults.  My husband is a conservative engineer.  I told him I had  Bee Movie, and he said, \\"Well, I'm going to be on the laptop so I won't really watch it.\\"  Well, he laughed so hard he couldn't talk.<br /><br />For a comedy about bees, it is surprisingly enthralling.  Thank you, Jerry Seinfeld!
B0013FBS20|1.0|I have no idea what Blu-Ray is but it would not work on my player.  When I tried to adjust my player I screwed things up badly.  Be careful when you buy a DVD if you don't have a Blu-Ray player or have no clue how to use it on your DVD player.  It can cause you a lot of grief.  Amazon should give a warning to those of us who are not up on the LATEST technology -- which is hard for some of us busy working folk.
B001152TL6|1.0|I wish I could find the original Amazon listing, copy it, paste it on an E-mail and send it to Universal home video and ask \\"Where the *** are the bonus features you said were going to be on this edition. This ranks way up at the top of most disappointing DVD releases. It is unforgiveable. I was genuinely angry when I put the DVD in my player and saw the menu (with music that's not even from the film, WTF?) The video transfer and sound quality are great. I never owned the Canadian version, because I had a widescreen VHS copy. It's great to finally complete my David Lynch DVD collection, but I am vastly disappointed with this release.
B00001OH7U|5.0|This is one of Bowie's more underrated efforts, due to the fact it was recorded in the mid 70's after the glam rock phase had ended, and before the experimental association with Brian Eno.    Some of these songs give off an initial impression of a basic love song quite like Neil Diamond or other similar musicians from the same time period (such as \\"Word on a Wing\\" and \\"Wild is the Wind\\").  However, there's something truly moving about these songs that will probably take most people a few close listens to really get what makes them so special.  I can't really explain it myself, just that they are distinct songs in the long and winding legacy of David Bowie.    The title song has two very different segments attached together, the first one sounding like something Pink Floyd would do (quiet and atmospheric) and the second segment builds in intensity while also showing a bit of sadness in Bowie's vocal delivery.  I'm really not sure if that was intentional or not.      \\"Stay\\" is a relaxed jam rocker, to put it simply, and \\"TVC15\\" predicts the early 80's new wave scene.  \\"Golden Years\\" was the big hit that everyone knows very well by now.    Yes, a great album in every way.

B000002GDJ|5.0|Whether the Police had intentions of saving rock and roll in the late 70's, being a revolutionary new punk band, or just liked the idea of mixing reggae with rock, their second album is a MASTERPIECE.    From top to bottom, the songwriting is wonderful and very inventive the entire time.  If you're looking for melody, it's here.  In fact, it's truly an album designed for people who specifically appreciate vocal melodies above everything else.  The way the album was recorded sounds very good and packs a LOT of energy and punch.      \\"Message In a Bottle\\" is vocal melody perfection and a classic pop song, \\"Walking on the Moon\\" delivers with a slow build up and terrific chorus, \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\" is memorable for the creepy bassline chugging along to the reggae beats, and it's totally a darn shame that \\"Bring on the Night\\" never received more recognition because it's amazingly catchy.     Early Police is a lot better than the commercially lackluster 80's stuff that most people seem to remember the Police for.  Remember the band for the energy and daring creativity of the early years, and buy Reggatta de Blanc in particular.
1933784032|4.0|As someone who was heavily influenced by Star Wars as a kid, so much so that I know work in the visual effects industry, this book is amazing.    While I love CG, I grew up watching movies that had absolutely astounding model making, and looking at these creations in close up is worth the price of the book.    The only issue I really have is that the physical binding/stitching on my copy of the book wasn't great.  After looking through it once or twice it was already looking a little ragged.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Naturally I baught the movie because I like it, so unless a movie is a new release, the ratings are always going to be high, but I must admit, the new final cut is very impressive.  The subtle inclusions from the cutting room floor really added to what can only be considered a work of art. The only small complaint is that they left off the scenes that made you wonder if our favourite anti-hero was himself a replicant (leaving this out made all those scenes showing the red glass like eyes of the artifical lifeforms a bit pointless). Another thing of great interest for hi tech lovers is the amazing job they did cleaning up the picture, gone is the grainy picture of old.  This movie really does justice to my new 58\\" screen.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is a truely wonderful film.  The special effects are amazing!  the casting and acting, supurb.  You will fall in love with Peter Pan- the story and the character whether you are 5 or 85.  There are a few parts that may be too scary for younger children but it is my 5 yr old daughter's favorite movie.  She calls it the Real Peter Pan.  It is also a good movie for us adults who don't want to grow up!  Be sure to watch the extras.  They are also very well done.  This does justice to Barrie's timeless tale.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Good, (and very long), civil war era drama.  One of the few movies that focuses on home life during the war, rather than the war itself.  Some over dramatic scenes, (including a chicken attack of all things), takes the movie out of the \\"great movie\\" category, but it's still a very good story, with fantastic cinematography and surround sound.  Worth a look, if you've got the time of course.
0739323687|5.0|Professor Hawking's A Briefer History of Time is an updated version (yes, shorter) of his 1988 surprise best-seller A Brief History of Time.  The intent is to give the reader an overview of what the top minds are thinking about the origins and future of the universe.  As expected Hawking does this with great wit, explaining complicated topics without any equations, as his publisher told him that each equation used will reduce sales by 50%.     It is not really necessary to read this book, if you have read the earlier work.  There is some new material, but not much.  As Hawking ages, he seems to have increased his metaphysical considerations, as this new work contains his thoughts on the role of God in all of this creation.     I saw Hawking speak (he uses a computer generated voice synthesizer) at a recent event in DC and he is truly an inspiration.  Keep in mind that all of his great scientific work was accomplished after he was stricken with Lou Gehrig's disease.
1592289444|5.0|Sunday, March 26, 2006   \\"The Long Walk\\" by Slavomir Rawicz, © 1956  This is an amazing story. It is incredible that the torturers in the U.S. Army did not read this or take lessons from the KGB, because some of their tortures are very similar to what is described in this book. But that is only in the first two chapters. The rest of the book is the story of Mr. Rawicz's walk with his cohorts from United Soviet Socialist Republic labor camp in Siberia to India. The walk starts with advise to walk south, not east, to avoid the obvious route and, therefore, obvious pursuit.  The oddest part of this story is that one of the particpants is known only as Mr. Smith. He is an American of unknown origins. No one on this trek is cognizant of the reason of their incarceration, but Mr. Smith is so unknown that even his Christian name is never known. The next oddest part of this story is in the preface. It was supposed to be a story about people who have encountered Yeti. These fellows saw some on their walk through the Himalayas, so the assistant to the author, Ronald Downing, reseaching for a story about the Yeti, came across this amazing story.
0312360266|1.0|Zoey:  perfect/goody-two shoes/never does anything wrong/fits in/has so many flaws in the way that she is perfect...horrible main character.  At the beginning, I thought that I'd give her a chance to see if I could relate to her, and I've regretted it ever since.  This plot is so predictable, and it seems that everything is going to work out perfectly for this girl.  She gets marked and her life turns around, of course she falls for the popular guy who states that he's a dork (what guy actually says that these days?).  I didn't like the language either...what kind of teens say Pooh!  these days??  Please...if you're looking for a book to get hooked on, this is not the one.

1402210795|5.0|What a wonderful book!  This was a favorite when I was in high school, and I've just re-read it at age 40.  I love it just as much now as I did then.  Although the characters are young, the humor and human situations are timeless.  It's like Jane Austen, but more readable, more funny, and more fun.<br /><br />The special thing about this book is how well developed all of the characters are-- so unusual in a romantic comedy.  The book has a fabulous gentle humor that draws you in and makes you love each of the endearing characters and truly \\"root for\\" a happy ending. The characters (both major and minor) are so very human, and each is challenged to grow and change through their interactions with each other.  A special treat is the fact that this is one of the longer Heyer books!  It is long enough to resolve all the threads of the story in a satisfying way.<br /><br />You will LOVE this book! It is absolutely Heyer's best.

B000002JNJ|3.0|The first time I heard Pantera was in late 1990 early 1991, the song was Cowboys From Hell, I thought wow these guys are pretty intense. I then heard Cemetary Gates, this song blew me away and I had to go buy the album. When I bought this album I was truly impressed and enjoyed it very much. Looking back at Pantera's discography this album was by far not their best, but Pantera was still a work in progress. If you want to check out Pantera you should start with Cowboys so you can hear the progression of their work. The title track, Primal Concrete Sledge, Psycho Holiday and of course Cemetary Gates are the standouts on this CD and you will notice that this is the last Pantera CD to feature Phil Anselmo's Rob Halford like vocals. After Cowboys, Phil stuck with his dinstinctive deep gravely sound.
B000VEA38E|4.0|Is everybody forgetting a great piece of Max Rebo music? The groovey music that plays while the sail barge travels to The Great Pit of Carcoon? So far, none of the soundtracks that I've listened to have this great jam. What gives? And instead of adding an additional bulk of music from the prequels, it would have been great to add not only the music that was replaced in the Special Editions, but also the Basic/English version of Lapti Nek. (Part of this can be heard watching the makings of Return of the Jedi) A CD featuring the music and songs from the Holiday Special (however awful), the Ewok Adventures features, and even the cheesey Star Wars disco would be a fan treat.
B000002H6C|5.0|Truly one of the greatest metal albums...no greatest albums of all time. The 1980's were filled with bland synth rock and pop and ugh! Michael Jackson. Metallica with the release of ...And Justice For All sent a clear and (very) loud message to the music industry, things were going to be different in the 1990's. This album opened the door for so many musical acts in the 90's to be heard, this would not have been possible without the success of ...And Justice, it showed the record companies that they could sign musical acts that were not of the norm and that they could sell records. Without Justice we may have never heard Nirvana, Manson, Pantera, Slayer, Alice In Chains, Tool etc. This was truly something Metallica could be proud of, they lead the way, but sadly did not continue to carry that torch.  For me this album was like opening a door to another world. I had never heard such furious sound coming from musical instruments. I was instantly addicted to this album. I was stuck in the hair metal rut and didn't know that this other world existed. Justice opened the door for me to check out Megadeth, Anthrax, Testament, Slayer, Death Angel, Iron Maiden, Pantera, Flotsam and Jetsam and so many more great tru (not nu) metal bands. Eventually it lead me to hear grunge because I was looking for the heaviest angst filled music I could find.  Some say Justice was just an angry album, but it was also an intelligent album from the concerned lyrics of Hetfield to the break neck musicianship of Hetfield, Ulrich and Hammett. In the 20 years since, this album still stands as one of a kind, I have never heard anybody say, this album sounds kinda like Justice nor will I ever.  An album like ...And Justice For All only comes along once in a life time.  So for you kids out there who want to check out Metallica stay away from everything after ...And Justice (except for Garage Inc.). Listen to Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets. If you want to get into metal and you want to go out and get the 10 best metal CD's ever, ...And Justice For All has got to be on that list.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|\\"In Treatment\\" is a beautiful work that was not given enough hype by HBO.  The acting is all there is and it is beyond outstanding.  The stories of the lives of the participants are realistic.  It is very easy to know these people and yet, like real people, realize that they are very complex and you don't really know them at all.  This series is addictive and I am going through withdrawal now that it is off the air.  I want more.

B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|In the short lived Fox TV series Firefly Joss Whedon created an interesting new world 500 years in the future that was a mixture of outer space adventure and the post Civil War old West. He peopled this world with an interesting group of misfits who somehow became a family by Episode 14. In Serenity much of the family atmosphere disappears and we are left with a medium budget action film. This is not necessarily bad just different.    The film starts about six months after the close of the series. River Tam (Summer Glau) has been broken out of a Government facility by her brother Simon (Sean Maher). River has unwittingly been turned into a weapon by the government but more frightenly she harbors a secret that has the potential to weaken the govenment itself. An assassin (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is sent to find her and bring her back at all costs.    Without spoilers that is the premise of the film. The characters are all ther from the show but they have changed in the time between the show's cancellation and the film's release. The Captain (Nathan Fillion) has become darker and more withdrawn. I think that his character is now closer to Whedon's original vision of him in the pilot episode. Other characters are not used as much as some of the fans may have wished but this is a limited run time film with nine main characters.    Whedon keeps the film running smoothly for its entire run time and the film looks more epic than the TV show ever could. As a side note the cinematography of Jack Green looks fantastic even though I enjoyed the work of David Boyd on the television show a little more with its rougher edged look. The music is now by David Newman and ids much more thematic than that of Greg Edmonson.    I watched the two disc Collector's Edition. The picture and sound were almost perfect. There are two commentary tracks: one featuring the cast which is more anecdotal and a more technical commentary by Whedon himself. Also available are numerous featurettes; some outtakes and deleted and extended scenes.    This may be one that appeals more to fans of the original series but the film stands on its own quite well. By all means see it.
B000022TSY|5.0|Yes the ending, the ending!!!!!!!!! that redneck goiter laden hick freak in his pick up truck deserved some little trophy award for saying that line \\"why dont you get a haircut?\\" and then Boom!!!!!!!!!!!. I remember walking out of that theatre unable to speak, feel or show expression. Those were my heroes (Billy and Captain America)seeing them get blown away so violently seeking freedom and the real America which thay found unfortunately, was just too much for me. But they needed to be martyrs for the movie to work as well as it did. A great American indie that needed to be made before the 60's left us for good. This is grass man it gives you a whole new way of looking at the day. Now If we can get someone to make Easy Rider 2. Get your motors running.
B000E41MRC|5.0|Leni Riefenstahl captured souls of the people participated in those events. Not knowing anything about history of Nazism before the Nueremberg congress nor after it - it would be difficult to understand what is the real spiritus movens of all that anonymous crowd and their 'dignitaries'. The most frightening thing to me in that movie is the youth naivety and innocence drowned into a surrealistic understanding of dignity and patriotism.

One evening, on his way back home, he heard singing voices of some women. To him - the songs and voices were angelic and never heard before. He decided to wait and see the approaching singers thinking that these singers might be equally angelic beautiful girls as their songs and voices were. To his great disappointment - he met a group of ugly, sweaty, old women going back to their homes from a work in fields. My father died twenty six years ago - but his expectation to see the girls of angelic beauty and voices would be met with the Celtic Woman - for sure.

Maybe all this world needs are more Word Shakers, not world shakers.

076790382X|5.0|With \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\" Bill Bryson proved to me that I was wrong thinking that \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" was unsurpassable. This collection of essays about the United States of America and the lifestyle and often puzzling habits of its inhabitants is a true gem. Now, I might be biased, because I found a lot of my own experience as a foreigner living in America very similar and therefore enjoyed Bryson's reflections, but his usual sharpness and wit, his ability to ponder on small things and point out details are important factors contributing to the objective value of this book.<br /><br />Bryson returned to America after twenty years abroad, moving to Hanover, New Hampshire with his British wife and British-born children. He was surprised to see how much the country of his childhood had changed and also, how different it was from what he was used to in Europe. The newspaper column was, however, his friend's idea, Bryson's reluctance stemming from the fact that the column was weekly... Luckily, he agreed and produced the articles collected in \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\". The collection spans different topics, from driving everywhere, through food, exercise, holidays (a hilarious piece on the Presidents' Day) to immigration procedures. Bryson criticizes and wonders without prejudice, giving his personal opinions about many hot issues, at the same time writing lightly and in a greatly amusing manner. The loving, tender relationship of the author with his country is visible even in his most scornful and negative remarks, in the cruelest jokes. Because of his great, flowing, casual style, even the most mundane and trivial musings are a joy to read.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I found many of Bryson's notes reflect my own feelings about America and my own observations - of course he put them into writing much better than I ever could. It may be because of the specificity of New England (I am sure other regions of this country are different still, as Bryson concludes comparing New Hampshire to Iowa of his childhood), but I loved this book and it convinced me that all Bryson's writings are worth the time.g New Hampshire to Iowa of his childhood), but I loved this book and it convinced me that all Bryson's writings are worth the time.

B000O75F7C|5.0|I heard my first PT song a long time ago on a digital music channel. I remember it being pretty cool but never got into PT myself. I saw this cd sitting all by itself on the music rack in our little PX here in afghanistan, where they sell nothing but country music and mainstream rap-crap. Im a pretty big metal fan and I bought Fear of a Blank Planet having no clue what it would sound like. only the simple fact that I kind of knew what genre to expect because I heard them so many years ago. But it turns out that this is the best CD that I've bought all year! its like a blend of Pink Floyd, Blur and Helmet or something. cant really describe their style, but their sound is awsome! it's not like any cd I've ever heard before. so unique. truely good stuff! they have a 17 minute song and every second of it is awsome! any metalhead, classic rock or 90's grunge fan (or whatever category you fall into) will love this cd. buy it.
B00005MP58|5.0|Still the best - apart from reading the book , of course. Very true to Jane Austen's novel. Wish it was even longer , I did not want to leave Mr and Mrs Darcy!
B000FC1JCQ|4.0|This book has tons of reviews, and it is a good, just fun read to escape for a while.  I'm not going to spend much time on the literary aspects because others here have done a great job.   What I do have to say is the Kindle edition is well formatted and has no issues.  If you like science fiction/fantasy this is a good read.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|The movie has a lot of action which keeps you watching it to the end. All of the people in the movie have there own individual things going on,which keeps the movie from lagging at any time.
B000WZAE1I|3.0|This movie had so much potential!! A brilliant cast, wonderful photography, and most important, a truly enchanting book as a basis--and its author, Neil Gaiman, was involved with production.  But most of the magic was left between the pages of the novel.  There are individually wonderful moments in this film--and Michelle Pfeiffer is completely irresistible as the wicked witch Lamia--but the movie is very uneven as whole.<br /><br />The truncation of the end of the book, and the decreased role of the people of Wall in it, throws the film off balance.  The interpretation of Captain Shakespeare is unfunny, and his making eyes at a certain party in a final scene is ridiculous, and not in a good way.  The revelation of certain secrets, although we suspect them all along, is made too suddenly, part of the reason that the end doesn't really feel as if it pays us off.<br /><br />The movie is definitely worth watching if you like fantasy, special effects, are a fan of one or more of the actors involved, and won't feel cheated by what happened to the novel on the way to the screen.  Do note that there are some really violent episodes which small children (and maybe some older folks too) may find upsetting, especially during the final scenes.  More stardust might have helped.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Doesn't matter which HD format you own, Planet Earth is the must have HD series in your collection. It should be a 4.75 stars rating instead of 5. It is because of some footages had been used in multiple episodes. Other than that, it will be a perfect Nature Documentary series.
B0001HLVS2|1.0|This movie is boring. There's nothing here that I like. I know people like it because of the pyschology and the emotion depicited in the film. Somehow, it does not appeal to me.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|An ASIA reunion was an impossibility - it was easier for China to renounce communism than for Wetton, Downes, Howe and Palmer to unite on the same stage and play their great world-famous repertoire of songs.  As they say, never say never - we fans have been given the gift of a European and US tour and now also the release of a new studio album in April 2008 - PHOENIX.    Asia disbanded in 1991 and left their fans without a quality live release from the four original members - John Wetton, Geoff Downes, Steve Howe and Carl Palmer.  Sixteen years later the four of them reunite and put together a fantastic, thoroughly enjoyable comeback tour. This is a recording of one of these shows (released also on DVD)offering the very best from their two albums - Asia and Alpha. One can feel that the four of them are enjoying themselves as this comes through via the excellent musicianship and wonderful solos.    The highlights of the set list are the outtake \\"Ride Easy\\", a past favourite of Wetton, and the four songs taken from the individual member's musical past - \\"Roundabout\\" from Howe, \\"Fanfare\\" from Palmer, \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\" from Wetton and \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" from Downes.    I recommend this live CD to all those who want to experience classic rock at its best with a touch of originality and a very unique lead vocalist.
1400082773|1.0|I digested the audio version of Dreams From My Father.     Whatever lead the author to writing the book years ago, the language and style of the potpourri of its stories tell me that he went out of his way to dazzle the reader and condition the reality to serve his ambitions.     There is no clear message in the book that would support Mr. Obama's choice of its title, nor did I find any clear message in it whatsoever.     I would also tike to add, in light of the author's current bid for presidency, that the book does not support his claims to being a uniter and an enthusiast for change.  The book does, it seems to me, support my preconceived notion of Mr. Obama as a slick man, craving attention and power, and jostling to get as high as he can in order to validate and glorify himself.  Indeed, had I believed prior to listening to Dreams From My Father Mr. Obama to be a person passionate about change, uniting America, bettering the lot of her poor and underprivileged (including those in the hoods of South Chicago), I would have almost certainly be dissuaded now by, among other, the author's nauseating use in the book of big words, high-flown language, and labored poetic imagery.

B0015AARJI|5.0|The Playstation 2's highly regarded DualShock 2 controller was considered by many to be the best videogame controller of all time.  So when you've got a winning design there's no need to change anything.  However, because of a legal battle with Immersion over rumble technology, Sony was forced to offer their Sixaxis controller without rumble.  The Sixaxis had the same Dualshock design but it felt too lightweight and cheap.  Thankfully the lawsuit has been settled and rumble has come back to the Playstation.    For the most part, the DualShock 3 is almost identical to its PS2 precessor.  But it has all the features of the original Sixaxis controller in addition to rumble.  The controller is still wireless, can be charged by plugging it into your PS3 (or PC), rumble is compatible with all PS1 and PS2 games, and the PS3 supports up to 7 controllers at the same time via bluetooth.  Rumble in the DualShock 3 seems more responsive in regards to the location of its vibration depending on which side you get hit on during the games.  I don't know if this is something in the design or if it's the developers doing it for the games but I welcome it.    All in all this is currently the best designed controller on the market right now.  The PS2's DS2 was incredible so \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" applies here.  I'll be enjoying rumble in my PS3 games from now on.
B00007BKVC|5.0|If you can imagine a blend of \\"9 to 5\\", \\"Smokey and the Bandit\\" and \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\", you should come up with an approximation of \\"Thelma and Louise\\": a mix of adventure, humor and comrade in the style of the Burt Reynold's chase movies, and getting even with the stereotypical men who try to abuse, control or recapture these 2 women intent on a short escape from their boring lives. The possession of a pistol or two and daredevil driving enables them to silence or elude most of the males who try to abuse or capture them or just have some fun with them. Clearly, Louise and Thelma initially have very different attitudes toward the men who try to seduce them. Louise makes it loud and clear  she wants no part of these amorous come ons, whereas Thelma, especially after a few drinks, is often flirtaceous and sometimes willing. But, Thelma eventually learned that fooling around with strange persistent men   can have traumatic consequences, and joined Louise in rebuffing these advances. According to the DVD commentary, many in the audiences cheered and clapped when Thelma's would be rapist is shot dead by Louise for his continued obscene threating remarks in the aftermath of Louise's breakup of the rape attempt. This clearly confirms what we may conclude from the popularity of confrontational westerns and action movies: that lethal vigilante justice, when done in appropriate circumstances, is considered justified by the majority of people, regardless of what the legal system thinks and does.      One gets the impression that even if this duo didn't face probable long prison sentences, they might have become permanent runaways from their unsatisfying routine lives. It is significant that neither had children, which may have alleviated some of their dissatisfaction, and which made their overblown girls night out gone bad practical. The fact that both these women were often foul-mouthed, smoked and occasionally went to seedy bars turns off some viewers, who label them brainless white trash who perhaps deserve some of the misadventures they suffered in their attempt to  have a short escape from their boring lives.     Brad Pitt and Michael Madison provide two handsome hunks for female viewers to drool over, though very different. Brad represents the perfect con man who exploits naive vulnerable women both sexually and financially. He was the perfect bad boy for Thelma to find release in. Michael represents a man who isn't willing to settle down to a permanent one on one relationship, but who is willing to make occasional sacrifices for the women he has relationships with.     The ending seems appropriate for the duo. Like Bonnie and Clyde, the pair eventually knew they were doomed to long prison sentences, or to die in a shootout, car accident or by their own device. Like Bonnie and Clyde, they were prepared to elude their pursuers as long as possible, and to engineer their deaths if capture seemed imminently certain.      This DVD is of excellent quality and includes several special features, including commentary versions by the director and by a combination of the main actresses and the screen writer.
B00005Q4CS|2.0|Before you watch this movie, here is something to think about ...    Most people who watch it consider it to be bleak and depressing. Others, who were not moved by the plight of the characters just found it boring and annoying.     So it seems like the very best you can possibly hope for after watching this movie is to feel bored and annoyed. Well, I'll give it 2 stars because I guess some people probably need to see it. I mean, if you're actually dumb enough to consider using, then maybe there's something in it for you. Otherwise, if watching a movie about people destroying their lives via drug addiction doesn't sound like your idea of a good time, I'd give it a pass.    But if you still want to see this movie, I'd just rent it. It's sort of like watching a documentary about the Nazi concentration camps and the horrors therein; I can't imagine why any person who is not emotionally disturbed would want to watch it more than once.
0670018651|5.0|I think the way I feel about this book may be something approaching love. This is a delightful read; witty, giddy, chic, dry, goofy and romantic, and manages to be historical and educational at the same time, but with the kind of playfulness that you get when real genius flexes itself in its chosen realm. It's like Einstein sticking out his tongue at the camera.    Because while for the artist, art is work, for the fan/aficionado, it's play, pleasure. Turin and Sanchez know that, I think, and that's why I am able to read this book from cover to cover like a novel like you could never do with a dictionary or encyclopedia. Perfumes: The Guide makes learning feel like eating candy. I can't put it down.    The only thing more that I could ever ask of it would be a \\"Scratch'n'Sniff\\" edition.
B0012K1ILW|1.0|I truly hated this cd and thought that Erykah would give a better product to her fans...  Very disappointing that I purchased this cd.
B000RJO578|5.0|I really liked this movie lots.  It was TOTALLY hilarious.  The characters have such a good on screen charisma and charm together that the humor just flows naturally.  I found myself laughing through the entire movie.  It's a clever film with lots of dry Brit humor and a bit of gore too.  Impressive!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|A real eye openner.  You owe it to yourself, friends and family to be educated on the content of this documentary.  The data has been taken from reliable independent sources, so for those that think this was fabricated, you are incorrect.
B000000OQY|5.0|A LOOOOOOOONG time ago this was THE second tape (yes tape) I bought with my allowance money (the 1st was Appetite for Destruction.)  I loved it then and still love it now.  People say there's no talent, the music is hatred and the singer is lousy....they are complete idiots.  The band is completely fantastic.  They broke up the mundane mainstream music and made their own type of musical masterpieces, unlike anything out there at the time.  The music is still kickass, my kids even love it!!  They STILL rock, and in my opinion are the BEST Rock band that exists.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I personally dislike Michael Moore, as he is a very disrespectful person.  But like Oprah said, regardless what you think of Michael Moore as a person, if you are an American, you must see this movie.  It is very eye openning, sad and sometimes funny.  A must see!
B0009R1T7M|5.0|As you may have heard, Sufjan Stevens wishes to come out with an album for each state and tailor the songs on each album to that particular state.  I love the creativity of his songwriting, I love his voice and I love most of the songs on this album.  \\"Chicago\\" has already gotten some play on the airwaves although the best track, in my opinion, is \\"Concerning a UFO Sighting Near Highland, IL\\".    Matt Zarnstorff
B000QUCNP4|4.0|This is one of the best crime/mystery movies I've seen in a long time. It's a bit longer than most but that was ok, since I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It had suspense, authenticity and great performances all around. The only problem was that I kept thinking, \\"I thought they never caught the Zodiac killer, but how could they have made a movie about the case if they didn't?\\". Well, my memory was correct about the killer never being caught, and that was the biggest disappointment about this movie. Instead of having the satisfaction of seeing Jake Gyllenhall track down the Zodiac to some abandoned warehouse, where our hero would be overpowered by the killer and on the verge of getting skewered before Mark Ruffalo appeared unexpectedly and put a bullet through the Zodiac's heart, we are left with a \\"climax\\" of seeing everyone connected with the investigation frustrated and disappointed. It's a bracing but perhaps salutary antidote to our pop-culture of happy endings to see such reality in a Hollywood film. Things sometimes....check that...things_usually_don't work out the way we want them to, but it is a man's duty, and compulsion (which this movie accurately shows women not understanding) to be true to his calling- in this case the pursuit of justice- no matter the obstacles, and that his efforts are still commendable even if their ultimate result is failure. Besides that didactic lesson, the movie provides a fascinating look inside the puzzle-solving nitty-gritty of police work, which was a bit more reliant on the human mind in the pre-computer age. So, my verdict is that this was a winner.<br /><br />As an aside, all the movies and publicity about the Zodiac killer, with his 5 known victims, stands in stark contrast to the media blackout of the Zebra killings, which claimed 71 innocents in San Francisco during the same time period. In that case, a gang of Black Islamic serial killers ritually butchered 71 men and women because they were White. The Black community of San Francisco impeded the investigation and showed no sympathy with the victims. At least one Black police officer conspired with the killers to try and murder a witness against them. Don't you think that would make a compelling drama? Yet, only 2 books have ever been written about the killings, and San Francisco has done its best to throw the case down the memory hole. Hollywood refuses to touch the story because it's politically incorrect. The Zodiac killings deserve remembering, but the Soviet-style deletion of the Zebra killings from public acknowledgment is a perfect example of the second-class status Whites victims have in the eyes of our ruling class when their killers are members of a privileged group.

B000MGUZM0|3.0|Not as good as Funeral, in my opinion but that would be a hard act for anyone to follow.  It is a different sound than Funeral also; you won't hear as many of the layered horns and strings. For some who looked forward to more of that, you might be disappointed. There are some great tracks on this album though; \\"Keep the Car Running\\" and \\"No Cars Go\\" are already hits.    Matt Zarnstorff
B000UBHYH6|4.0|You hear it everywhere in modern music - octave double in the guitar riffs.  Wes Montgomery was the man responsible for this wonderful sonic improvement to what could potentially be another boring guitar line.    This album should be in every guitarist's collection - regardless of their selected genre.    4 out of 5 stars because the source material was recorded in live sessions and the engineering is a bit on the week side.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I like the unique, upbeat sound that Vampire Weekend has.  The drums sets and basic rhythm of the songs sets them apart from many groups.  For fans of indie music, you will like their upbeat style.  I like some of the chords tied in with a type of afro-pop beat.  They definitely have their own sound which cannot be said very often in today's day and age. \\"Oxford Comma\\" is the best song on here in my opinion.    Matt Zarnstorff
B0013FSL0C|5.0|This is a powerful, deeply moving, intelligent, emotionally nuanced series. It consisting of nothing more than psychotherapy sessions between a cast of reoccuring characters, this show fills an important niche missing from most television -- the richness, complexity, and heartbreak of the \\"emotional life.\\"<br /><br />Are you tired of seeing thin, carbon-copied and cliched characters in movies and television shows? Then this is the perfect series for you, because here the whole point is to explore the inner lives of the characters.<br /><br />Does the the fact that this series focuses a great deal on the emotions of the characters mean that there is no \\"action?\\" Only if you define \\"action\\" as soley encompassing explosions or giant robot attacks.<br /><br />To me, however, there was more action in this show than almost any other I've seen: there was the complexity of coming to terms with the guilt of death, of a disintergrating marriage, of children torn between parents, of unrequieted love, of the intense pressures to be successful, of professional jealousy, of the quiet desperation of everyday life, and the pain and bravery of those trying to take control of their lives.<br /><br />The writing is really quite incredible. I was time and again rivited by the ways in which the story tellers captured and traced the emotionally raw and complex workings of the human heart- the tangled web which constitutes human relationships.<br /><br />Some detractors have said they find the characters \\"annoying:\\" these characters strike me as \\"real,\\" for, in life, people are themselves complex and full of paradoxes, at times annoying but at others deeply sympathetic. I came to be involved with all the characters, and, in the end, they all suprised me, up until the very last episode.<br /><br />The acting is also superb. Gabriel Byrne (as the therapist \\"Paul\\") gives the performance of his lifetime, and Mia Wasikowska gives a star making performance as \\"Sophie,\\" a troubled gymnast.<br /><br />This is a show for people who find themselves interested in the human mind and heart, particularly, in the complex ways in which we become entangled with our fellow human beings, and often punish ourselves, lie to ourselves, and hide from our own inner truths. What is the thrill of an asteroid threatening to destroy the Earth compared to the everyday struggle with such things as love, guilt, and the fear of facing another day on this planet.<br /><br />Truly, one of the great shows I have seen- original, thought provoking, powerfully acted, intelligently written, and as deep and as rich a portrait of the human soul as we're likely to ever get on television.interested in the human mind and heart, particularly, in the complex ways in which we become entangled with our fellow human beings, and often punish ourselves, lie to ourselves, and hide from our own inner truths.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|I want to start out saying ONCE upon a time because it might have fairy tale qualities but it also seems like something that really could happen. You don't have to check the rational side of your brain at the beginning. You come away thinking, that really could have happened in life. Glen lives and works with his widowed father who owns a vacuum cleaner repair service. He has also just broken off a romantic relationship with a girl who is still living in London. He wants to be a full time musician and in his spare time he plays in the downtown area on the streets of Dublin. Marketa and her infant daughter live with her widowed mother in a small apartment. We learn she is estranged from her husband (still living in the Czech Republic) and it just wasn't working out. She sells flowers and other small items on the streets to support her small family. They meet on the street when she listens to one of his songs and strikes up a conversation. She, too, loves music and 'borrows' a piano at the local music store during lunch because she can't afford a piano of her own. They find they have a shared passion for writing and creating music. A relationship starts to develop. Where will it lead? Is it more than just music? Is this the ONE chance for both of them to fulfill their dreams together? Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune says, \\"ONCE may well be the best music film of our generation.\\" [...]
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I've been a Stargate fans since the very beginging and \\"The Ark of Truth\\" didn't let me down.  Just too bad the Richard Dean Anderson couldn't have  made a cameo in the movie!  If you hadn't watch the TV show, you might not be able to understand the story line but I found it exciting and very well made!
B000PAAH3K|5.0|In short, it is a book about when we can rely on our instincts (gut feeling) and when we should use our head and think things through.  It also touches on how and why our instincts are sometimes wrong or unreliable, and how we can try to \\"teach\\" it to work better.  Very interesting, with great options for further reading and great stories and examples throughout.

0393316041|5.0|I love physics and reading biographies and in a way this is a perfect book.  It does not go into physics issues though, it is more about the life of a great scientist and a very different and profound person, Feynman.  The only strong criticism may be that he was known for telling stories about himself, and generally knew how to portray an image of a very smart and original man.  I don't mind, however, and still like to believe he was all of that.    Not just fun, but also an opportunity to be introspective.

B000NA2BEU|5.0|Many people seem to have been let down by Veronica Mars' 3rd Season. I must report -- I am not one of them. Instead, I found this season to be just as strong as the two before it, and possibly stronger overall than the 2nd.    In the 3rd Season, Mars makes the jump to college that so many high school shows ultimately do. It's always hard on a show, to make that large-scale transition, but this one pulls it off pretty well. Yes, it's true -- some characters get less time in the spotlight (like, understandably, Weevil), but that doesn't mean that characterization suddenly weakens in the show. Instead, we meet some new characters, and get a deeper glimpse into one or two (like, finally, Dick).    Moreover, Veronica Mars, by its nature, is a constantly evolving show. The first season revolved around mysteries and conflicts that were all essentially resolved by the season finale. By this point in the series, we're far from what gave the show its initial identity -- Veronica isn't as much of an outcast anymore; her romantic situation is far different; her parental situation has changed, having resolved the situation with her mother; she understands what were once question-marks about her past; High School has ended. Characters we've known and loved have died, or gone to jail, and others have taken their places in one way or another. In short, it makes sense to me that there are people who bought into the show in Season One, who cannot hang tight through Season Three, because they're fairly different experiences. If someone just absolutely loved Duncan, and watched the show for him (and there must have been some)... well... they'd be disappointed. But what does not change are good characters, tight plots, smooth writing, and excellent acting, and these are what keep me happy with the show all the way through to its too-soon final minutes.    The smaller plot-arcs this season employs, instead of the marathon sessions of the first two, are well done and each satisfying. Those who say that the show's final episodes are all stand-alone, this is only partially true. While there isn't the over-arching mystery for Veronica to solve over the last few episodes, there are running arcs that tie events together, like the upcoming Sheriff's election, and of course the constantly dissolving/re-forming relationship dynamics.    The last (and sadly final) episode is powerful and gripping, and makes any good fan clamor for a continuation, which was, perhaps, the point.    All in all, and even if I never get my final resolution, I'm happy with the show and grateful for the entertainment it's provided over three stellar seasons. Season Three is no drop-off in quality from its predecessors, and only hurts me in its sudden finality.    Excellent show. Excellent season. Five stars.

0375707972|5.0|After reading the Los Angeles Times' cover note that The Reader is a \\"disturbing and finally morally devastating novel,\\" I postponed reading it till I thought I could handle 'moral devastation.' I have to say that was quite an overstatement, in my opinion: part of the self-righteousness that appears in the trial in the latter half of the book.<br /><br />Bernard Schlink created a delightful afternoon read that included erotic interludes reminiscent of [[ASIN:B0000024PC The Graduate (1967 Film)]], intellectual and moral arguments and a decision on the best way to honor someone you love in difficult circumstances.<br /><br />A bit of an insider's view (Nazi's) of the holocaust toys with conventional horror at what was perpetrated. Were guards in fear for their lives if they did not cooperate fully?<br /><br />Far from theoretical analysis, Schlink forces us to new analyses by asking, \\"What is law? Is it what is on the books, or what is actually enacted and obeyed in a society? Or is law what must be enacted and obeyed, whether or not it is on the books, if things are to go right?\\"<br /><br />Showing a keen understanding of humanity, Schlink writes, \\"Even when the facts took our breath away, we held them up triumphantly. Look at this!\\" (That could account for part of the passion surrounding [[ASIN:B00012QM8G Schindler's List (Widescreen Edition)]].)<br /><br />Are we all doomed to punish ourselves if society doesn't punish us enough? Or to punish ourselves for the crimes society does not even hold against us?<br /><br />If you want a fun book, this will do it. If you want a book that will haunt you for months or even years, this will do it. If you want a book with characters and actions about which you can argue and philosophize way into the night, this one will do that, too!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|It is rare to find an album that you can listen to from the beginning to the end. This is one of those rare albums. It represents the growth of Mayer as a song writer, singer and musician. The bluzy tune, the socially concious lyrics, the skillful guitar playing, and the souful vocal will take you from one emotion to another and transport you from one place to the other. His messages are deep. I have been to his concert and his live performance was impressive - both his mastery of his guitar and his vocal. Buy this album and his others. You will be glad that you did!

JT gets behind the piano and sings in Places In My Past.<br /><br />And I can't remember why<br />But I still love those good times gone by<br /><br />James grabs his guitar and sings the sad and atmospheric Hey Mister, That's Me Up On The Jukebox, and you feel like you're sitting there with him. There are plenty of other great songs on the album, too, including Long Ago And Far Away, Highway Song and the bluesy Machine Gun Kelly. The album closes with the short but sweet Isn't It Nice To Be Home Again which features JT alone with his acoustic guitar.<br /><br />The album won two Grammy Awards including Best Pop Vocal Performance and Song Of The Year (You've Got A Friend).

B000P0J09W|4.0|it was a very good movie the first time i seen it 20 some years ago and it still makes me laugh even now. so it has to be a very good flick for me to spend the money to buy it.
B00011F5DK|4.0|I like to invite people over for an evening of chatting and good times, and most of the time it involves playing games (in my house, anyway).  This is one of those games you can play and still have a decent conversation with people and just have good times.  I love to bring this one out at my place, though I never bring it with me to someone else's house.  There are lots of small pieces that are too easy to loose....
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I have never had to ask for my money back in all my life, untill now. It had a decent story about it, thats what got the single star.. I felt like i was watching a underground High School movie production.. The only good thing about the ending was that it ended so i could go home and ponder Why a movie like this would even be shown anywhere but some rouge 5 day movie Festval between 2am and 4am. Stay away from this movie, if you have a friend who buys it goahead and watch it so you can see what i am talking about, but what ever you do DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Not entirely satisfying.  Ark of Truth is like being invited to Mom's for Thanksgiving dinner and finding out there is no pumpkin pie.  Ark of Truth serves its purpose and ties up loose ends but with little originality or suspense and with a good deal of bland dialog. The interaction between characters lacks the humor and spark of the television series. The production is good and the scenery is great but the director seems to have been rushing to stay as close to an hour and a half as possible.  Thirty minutes more and the Richard Dean Anderson would have made the difference between merely okay and very, very good.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME... and that's saying a lot!  I'm a fickle music listener and I'm never faithful to one artist.  I tend to like one or two songs off of every cd, but not with Sara.  I LOVE EVERY, SINGLE SECOND OF EVERY, SINGLE SONG!  Ms. Bareilles is so talented and I can't wait to hear more from her.  You won't regret getting this one! Plus the second disc is such a bonus!  Oh and jump at the chance to see her live, she's even more amazing in concert!
B00104QSOM|1.0|This is a review of the packaging which all but makes this purchase a rip-off!  A horrible treatment of a fantastic film.  The two-disc edition comes in a folded and cheap cardboard package.  The discs are tucked very tightly into a couple of cardboard flaps and are so difficult to get out that you WILL scratch your discs every time you remove and replace them in their flaps.  Why this choice of packaging was made has me scratching my head.  When I pay $22.00+ for a brand new double-disc set I at least expect packaging which protects and does not damage the DVDs.   I can only think this is a cruel joke made by the studio to the consumer.  But I suppose 6 months from now they will be laughing again when they release the super-deluxe 3 disc edition with improved packaging and force consumers to once again pony up for the product.  Horrible... just horrible!

Chris will leave the reader inspired and refusing to believe that such a good person could leave the world in such a horrendous way.
0143038419|2.0|I borrowed this book from the library, long quit buying these self indulgent american travelogues, especially those by women. She is a good writer, and keeps the reader interested. I could not relate emotionally to her story though, I have travelled widely myself and seen many cultures and lifestyles. We all have times in life where we are lost/depressed/sad and we find our ways out in many ways. Majority friends I have believe it was 'her way' and definitely one she has articulated well. Perhaps. For one thing, most people in her situation or even much worser situations do not get paid to travel like she did. Even if they do, even few of them get paid to write books and have it sell millions of copies. If there is one key factor missing all through this book, i would say 'GRATITUDE'. I hope at some stage in her life this woman realizes how lucky she is, to have done all the things she did and have people read about it. I hope she realizes that there are many women who do extraordinary things in her situation, with much less resources - one woman i know from India raised 8 children, 5 of them to be doctors and diplomats, by selling produce. Another african lady survived war and gang rape to be well settled and runs woman shelters in Nebraska. There are many,many more, who never get read about or talked about and are much greater in strength and character.    To the people who read, including me - it is her choice what she writes, self indulgent or not, we have no control over that. I think about spending my money, and wisely. I'd rather donate the 12$ or how much ever the book costs to the nearest woman shelter, and read from the library if I have to.And to the next whiny woman who comes along thinking running off to ashrams or taking foreign lovers makes her extraordinary or even helps her find her 'self', I would say, do it but please don't tire the world making it into a book.

0446401307|4.0|Shorter than the usual Connelly-Bosch combination, but just as rich. The plot is taut and requires Bosch's terrific power of observation, gut instincts and relentless ability to stick with the facts. Maybe not as layered as some other Connelly works, but a very satisfying entry in the Bosch chronicles. The scene near the end, where Bosch is a couple of steps ahead of Walling and helps her see what he has already seen -- or, in this case, not seen -- is a beauty for dialogue and how to reveal what's really going on, including for us readers.
0670018651|5.0|Yes, perfume is subjective. Sure, you won't agree with all the reviews. But does that make reading about it any less enjoyable? No! If you love perfume, you need this book. So many reviews are like a feast for the senses. You'll find yourself drawn to the perfume counter (or your own perfume collection) with book in hand, testing out your own nose, wondering if you can smell the heliotrope or the oakmoss. It's a fun challenge! Even if you don't love perfume, you still need this book. It will inspire you to delve into the world of delicious, provocative and mysterious scents that have been enchanting people since the beginning of time.     I really enjoyed the way this book was organized. It's very easy to navigate and very logical in its approach. I also appreciate the fact that, even though the authors are clearly experts in the field of fragrance, the book is written for the layperson. It's not at all dry, scientific or pompous in tone--like some writings about perfume can be--although there are snippets of chemistry speak here and there. It's very easy to understand and peppered with funny and very unpretentious and relatable observations. A great reference guide for buying, analyzing or just reading about perfumes.
0670018651|5.0|last night i read this book for hours and it has left me with the *real* hope that it will make a difference for the way the perfume houses treat their classic fragrances (and let me tell you, i had given up on that, resigning myself to the fact that the general culture of greed will always prevail: cutting corners, cheapening, slashing and burning and mangling and destroying. but -- just maybe -- this book will help stem the destruction.)    what i mean is that the authors give concrete information about changes older fragrances have gone through -- cutting through the hype and obfuscation of the marketing departments insisting that what they sell us under the same name is the same formulation and juice -- when we *know* it's not.  sanchez and turin simply state  (IN WRITING that is not as ephemeral feeling as blogs are and with the clout of turin's name behind it) what we all know is the truth: *classics have been changed* (and how they've changed they will tell us too, in their own, highly irreverent, highly entertaining, and yes, highly subjective ways.)    my hope is that this book will have an impact on the fragrance industry -- that it will make them think a little more before they slaughter classic fragrances, and fight a little more to be able to keep using ingredients that have been used for a long time, and that *make* the fragrance. that they will at least have to contend with a general knowledge that they *in fact* have made changes, and that they will be more transparent with the changes they *have* made: telling us what and why and by whom.    and therefore, i do hope there will be a \\"perfumes. the guide.  part 2\\"  which lists as many of the classic (reformulated and/or discontinued) fragrances as possible (since many have been left out.)    it's a true public service turin and sanchez are doing us here.    and then there is the fact that the thing is so much fun to read! i have not been as happy with a perfume book since edward michael's \\"perfume legends\\" about 10 years ago (and turin's original \\"le guide\\" in french, which i could barely read, my french being so bad.)    and lastly and for what it's worth: chandler burr, who i used to judge pompous and disliked based on his -- sometimes pompous -- writing is redeemed in my eyes by sanchez' mentioning him in her acknowledgements: she's thanking burr for \\"telling fragrance pr people to get used to it\\" and she can only mean that he told them that perfume writing is not all pr and hype -- and that the first amandment applies to fragrance-writing as well.     and so: a wonderfully entertainining book, this book. but also: an important book.    so go and buy it, everybody -- if for nothing else than for the hope that it will instill a measure of fear in the fragrance industry's heart.

B000TGJ8IU|5.0|The Iliad has always been my all-time favorite story, and I was very skeptical about Brad Pitt playing my favorite Hero, Achilles. When I saw the movie in the theater, I though it was okay, and never had the urge to see it again, but one night I was in the DVD section of a major retailer and the very cool packaging caught my eye. I bought it right away, and was blown away by the film the second time around. No one should ever second-guess Wolfgang Petersen. He truly understood the story and knew how it should be told. He filmed it the way he wanted it to be presented, but of course, the producers always seem to screw things up afterwards on any movie and it was edited badly, in some cases ending conversations before the characters were finished with their dialog. If this movie had been shown in theaters the way it's presented here, It would have been way more successful, but that's Hollywood. Thank God epics like The Ten Commandments, or Ben-Hur were not made in this day and age. I can just see some modern-day Hollywood idiot casting Justin Timberlake as Moses or Kid Rock as Ben-hur. Man that would Suck! I don't think even Wolfgang could save either of those!
184195425X|2.0|The Life of Pi did not make me believe in God.  It only reinforced what I already knew about man and animals-- that along the evolutionary trail, man and animals developed strong survival skills.  Sadly, animals will never evolve intellect and spirituality.  Is this realization the reason we would come to be made to believe in God?  Sorry!  It didn't work!  The absurdity of life remains in the forefront and this story is just to silly and absurd.
B0000524CY|5.0|To coincide with the re-release of this movie on DVD with all the extras, and the now-famous \\"Spider-Walk\\" scene, The Exorcist was shown again in movie theaters at the time. My Wife and Son and I were treated to an interesting experience during the movie; AN EARTHQUAKE! It was not a major one, but that along with the movie being as scary as it was, almost half the people in the theater walked out, and you could hear some of them saying things like \\"I can't handle this\\", \\"this is too much\\", \\"I'm gonna have a heart attack\\". I must admit it was a bit overwhelming, but I felt like I got my money's worth even if the Earthquake was not a special effect dreamt up by the theater or the producers of the film. (i.e. the vibrating seats during \\"The Tingler\\").  WHAT A RIDE!!! The only thing that would have made this movie scarier is if Alfred Hitchcock had directed it. I recently read that he was more than a little interested, and even tried to secure the rights to it. Who could've handled a film that scary? Not Me.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I first saw and heard Josh on the Jimmy Kimmel show during the Matt Daemon love skit. I bought the album based on the show and my sister's recommendation. The album is very enchanting. My favorite song is So She Dances; its so beautiful.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  Great music and choices of songs - especially  when you realize Melody Gardot's pain and story behind the CD.  I hope we will hear more from this artist in years to come!  I will purchase anything she puts out.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|While Ellen Paige gets accolades for her performance and Diablo Cody's story of stripper turned Oscar winning screenwriter have garnered attention of the public, the director Jason Reitman gets less and less kudos for his work on this movie.  Yet its his direction that often makes this work so well.  Juno is Reitman's second feature.  Like his first feature, \\"Thank You For Smoking,\\" he's dealt with the task of taking a hot button issue, making it funny, and thereby not making it an issue.  This is why Juno works - And it's the team of Reitman, Cody, and Paige that make the whole thing come together.<br /><br />The script reminds of a Kevin Smith script for a slightly younger less stoned generation.  That is to say that the dialogue is hip, sharp, and quick.  Not only is it fun and reverent, but it doesn't drag.  Some people have griped about the unnatural way people talk in this film and that's when you have to looks at some of the best comedy scripts in recent years and you realize that writers like Cody and Smith carve out their own worlds in their stories.  It feels natural in the world of Juno that Juno can quip at the store clerk about her pregnancy test and he'll give a clever quip back.<br /><br />That actors in this movie bring Cody's clever dialogue to life.  While Ellen Paige carries a lot of the scripts weight, she's also supported by wonderful character actor JK Simmons as Juno's father.  In all the fun, the relationship with Juno's family is addressed very sincerely.<br /><br />What makes the film work above all things though is how, as stated earlier, this is not a movie about teen pregnancy.  Think of it as a device and you'll get the politics out of your system.  Cody's script is more about love, friendship, and maturity.  The film is a feel good film, but the relationships in the film are complex.  Cody's script and Reitman's direction keep you interested til the end giving a very satisfying conclusion.
0786838655|5.0|The five-star rating is my 12-year-old son's view of this book.  We listened to it together and, while I only liked it compared to his loving it, I would certainly recommend it for kids to read or families to share.  Much about the book is standard fare, reasonably well presented:  outcast kid discovers he has special powers in magical world and, together with two friends (a boy and a girl) must undertake a dangerous adventure to save the world, figuring things out that the adults overlooked along the way.  Of course, so many books follow that particular line for a reason, and this book is well-enough executed to make it a success.        What makes the book special is the introduction of greek mythology.  The kids are the products of a mortal parent and a greek god parent--giving them special powers related to their immortal parent--and the book is chock full of greek mythology in the midst of the modern world, from Medusa's statuary shop to Hades beneath L.A..  While at times one is reminded of an episode of Cheers in which Dr. Crane introduces a maniac, killer clown to keep the rest of the patrons interested in his retelling of A Tale of Two Cities, I felt the mythological side significantly enriched the book.  Both my son and I were constantly going to Google to refresh our recollection about various ancient myths, and it helped to keep fresh the story's familiar pathway
B0013ISU0A|2.0|Unlike many people, I liked some of the songs on the last few REM albums.  \\"Leaving New York\\" and \\"Around the Sun,\\" for example, are wonderful songs. The new CD is really phenomenal, however, and several of the songs (e.g. \\"Hollow Man\\" and \\"Accelerate\\")are amongst the best the band has ever recorded.  I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering the CD/DVD package, and given their recent track record (the \\"REM Live\\" DVD, for example), I suppose it's not a shock that the DVD is complete and utter garbage. The video looks very much like the work of a pretentious 20 year old art student who is trying very hard to show how clever he is.  It's complete dreck, nearly unwatchable, and belongs in the trash.
B00104QSOM|3.0|Having been bitten by the HD bug I cringed when this film was not announced on Blu-Ray. I love the film so much so I picked it up on an impulse buy, and I was truly disappointed. The audio transfer is fantastic, but the picture quality is abysmal. Again, I'm picky, so for those of you who have not seen this film, by all means buy it, it's well worth your money, I just hope the Blu-Ray comes out soon...
B00008NRI7|4.0|Light and fun, airy and pleasant.  Would be a good date movie, but I watched it alone and enjoyed it.  Didn't think I would when I pulled it out of the bargain bin, but both actors work pretty well off each other and there was surely a chemistry between them (a good hybrid between friendliness and romance).  You'll chuckle some.  I'm embarrassed to say it, but this is a well enough made movie and entertaining in an easy way.
B0014CQNTK|5.0|Originality is a lot to come by these days.  Not to mention, this pails in comparison to the many hostile male movies of the year.  This one should have picked up more Oscars.  Finally a great chick flick that they don't necessarily cram into that category, but falls under what we all really want in a flick.
0765318741|5.0|Including by me. I did not think the genre has a right to exist. I thought Stoker said all that needs to be said.<br />Then came this book, some 50 years ago, and combined the vampire theme with the 'end of the world' genre and created a strong story in its own right. In its simplicity and clarity it has a chance to be a long-term survivor. Well, typical vampire.<br />I had watched the recent movie and liked it, and this way I learned about the book, which an AF recommended to me. I picked it up for a long distance flight and started reading early in the flight. Then I noticed it was on offer in the video system (one of Lufthansa Business Class strong features), both in the new version with Smith, which I knew already, and in the older one with Charlton Heston. Since the man just died, I was tempted to try the movie, but found it not worth the effort. It is a wooden pointless aged product without merits. (While the Will Smith version is likeable.)<br />So back to the book. Its hero Neville is a soulmate of mine, a hermit. He also calls himself a Robinson (this for my critic who blamed me for that comparison im my film review.)<br />Neville is not a scientist, but tries to understand what happened, why mankind has been seemingly eradicated by a plague and why the dead have become vampires unless burned. His fight against despair, lonelyness, alcohol, suicide, vampires, cluelessness makes it a very strong piece of storytelling.
B000ZN258W|5.0|I don't know why industry hacks and some reviewers compare Dig, Lazarus, Dig to Grinderman. About the only real similarity is that the Bad Seeds seems to have gotten away from songs centered around Cave's piano and rediscovered the guitar.  Grinderman is a \\"half-back\\" journey that nods to Nick Cave's goth-punk roots. Dig, Lazarus, Dig is a leap forward into the kind of inventive guitar driven music that the Bad Seeds haven't touched in a long time. I liked this recording the first time I played it through and I like it more every time I hear it. There is so much going on musically that it just keeps getting better with each listen.  Real fans of Nick Cave won't be disappointed by Cave's return to the guitar. They will be delighted, because most of us as fans are not just aboard for the music, we are aboard for the lyrics. Cave is one of the few songwriters that can pull off the trick of making edgy, raunchy lyrics sound like the pinnacle of erudition.  There is nothing I dislike here in the fifty plus minutes of stirring rock and roll. But some songs are of course better than others. My favorites are Today's Lesson, We Call Upon The Author, Hold On To Yourself (with its haunting organ), Lie Down Here (& Be My Girl), and Jesus of the Moon.  If you are a Nick Cave fan, I think you'll find that Dig, Lazarus, Dig is his best album overall since No More Shall We Part. The booklet of lyrics you get with this import edition is fine, but I am curious as to what you get with the US release dubbed special/limited edition besides a much better price. The price of this has remained fairly static, the price of the other has done a deep Lewinsky. Whichever one you decide on, you are not going to be disappointed.
006135323X|4.0|Anyone who believes that humans are rational cost-benefit calculators, as per the economics perspective on human decision-making, needs to read this book.  It adds to a recent body of literature, including Gigerenzer's \\"Gut Feelings,\\" Fine's \\"A Mind of Its Own,\\" Tavris and Aronson's \\"Mistakes Were Made (But not by Me\\"), and Gladwell's \\"Blink.\\" So, this book, per se, does not really break new ground.  However, it does make a contribution to the larger discussion.  And much is at stake here, whether in terms of political decision-making (after all, our elected leaders are just like the rest of us in how we think) or daily decisions about what products to buy.<br /><br />The book addresses what the author refers to as one view of human nature (Page xix), \\"the rational economic model. . . \\" (For a simple discussion of expectations from the economics view of human nature, see the discussion on pages 64-65). In contrast, this book takes a different--and far more accurate view--of human nature. Dan Ariely says that (Page xix): \\". . .this book is about human irrationality--about our distance from perfection.\\" To the extent that government policy and the economic sphere accept the standard view of human rationality, they are basing decisions on an erroneous view of human nature. Will swift and certain punishment deter crime?  If people are rational economic calculators, yes.  If not?  Forget about it. It's phony baloney. That's what is at stake with this book.<br /><br />The book covers a number of relevant topics as to how humans make decisions.  We overweigh negative consequences, we make foolish decisions based on whether or not something is labeled as \\"free,\\" social norms will often trump cost-benefit calculations, how anchoring of choices skews our decision-making, and so on. One of the nice features of this book is the outlining of various experiments that the author and his colleagues have carried out.<br /><br />He concludes that (Page 243): \\". . .we are pawns in a game whose forces we largely fail to comprehend.\\" A second lesson? Understand that key point and learn how to make decisions given our departure from the rational decision-making orientation. As the author says (Page 244): \\"Once we understand when and where we may make erroneous decisions, we can try to be more vigilant, force ourselves to think differently about those decisions, or use technology to overcome our inherent shortcomings.\\"<br /><br />In one sense, being critical of how we make decisions is a bit wrongheaded.  That's how people are. Shortcomings?  Sure, but that's where we are and that's who we are.  And, as Gigerenzer suggests, our flawed decision-making may actually, through the long evolutionary history of our species, do as well or better than economic models of decision-making.  So, this is another useful work raising questions about the nature of human nature--and making us more human in the process.rgely fail to comprehend.\\" A second lesson?

1883217040|5.0|This is the best book of its type that I have come across. It is written in a very accessible style with lots of examples to help you grasp the concepts. It makes apparently esoteric jazz concepts understandable, and complies them in one volume. It provides lots of tips and advice, and the friendly tone of the book is encouraging for the burgeoning musician.
0446677450|4.0|I hate to admit it, but this book is worth the read.<br /><br />First the negative, this is a laughingly badly written written--didn't the author have an editor?  The book uses the device of a series of discussions with a fictional rich dad and poor dad.  The language is at times insultingly simple, the author often takes forever to make sometimes very simple points, he has a tendency to say the same things over and over, he often starts thoughts that never get concluded or explained, and in many instances presents overly broad pronouncements as unquestionable fact.<br /><br />If you can get past those huge failings, the lessons in the book are truly invaluable.  Distilled down to its essence, the book teaches that rich people structure their economic life to channel available monies into their \\"asset column\\"--that being those investments that will generate income, with the intent of living off of those investments. Hence, wealth is that point where those investments generate enough cash flow to cover expenses.  Those who do not follow this strategy are forced to exist on income generated by effort, which require continued working, are subject to risk such as loss of job, etc.  As the author says, rather than working for money, rich people know how to make money work for them. By following this simple lesson alone, people will certainly be able to create wealth and a better life.<br /><br />While some other reviewers have cited the \\"duh factor\\" on some of his points, I think that's unfair.  There are many things that we \\"know\\" to be true, but have to hear over and over AND OVER again for them to sink in.  (That's why therapy doesn't last for one session).  So the fact that some of these lessons are intuitive or obvious is less important to me.  Additionally, some of the more obvious lessons are used as the basis for less obvious ones, which again merits their inclusion.<br /><br />Another common knock on the book is its lack of a specific strategy to grow rich.  The book does talk in general concepts, but that's OK.  There are lots of other books that lay out specific strategies to invest in specific fields, but that's simply not the arena this book stakes out.<br /><br />This book does a good job laying out the general terms of an approach to generating income, and does a good job of making a reader enthusiastic and excited about the possibilities.  That's a great place for a discussion of wealth to start--and in fact, has now brought me to other more specific books to continue my reading.<br /><br />I SAY READ THIS BOOK, TAKE NOTES, AND GRIN AND BEAR THE PRESENTATION.oncepts, but that's OK.

As other reviewers have said, it's not unalterated genius.  But there are some great moments and memorable tunes.  And, heck, it's got a good beat and you can dance to it ...  for real.
0670018651|5.0|Finally real critique in an area of multibillion commerce where pussyfooting was the most negative comment one would ever read, and where non-sensical hype in press releases was the norm. For the novice: neither Georgio Armani nor David Beckham have ever mixed a perfume, no designer or celebrity most likely ever has: they lend their name (not for free, as you might guess) and perhaps a \\"concept\\" to a fragrance, and that's it. The actual toil of producing the \\"juice\\" on a most-often pitiful budget (vs. the millions that go into advertising and promotions) falls into the hands of more or less gifted \\"house elves\\", the perfumers, who until recently were entirely creatures of the shadows. And Luca and Tanya lead you into this world from the angle of an incorruptibe sense for quality and craftsmanship which form the base of great art and whose absence defines \\"good intention, but...\\" or outright trash. No holding back here: the next time you stop in the ground-level fragrance bazaar of your favorite department store, be aware that the fragrance industry is perhaps the only business that gets constantly away with blatant label fraud: if you think the \\"Fahrenheit\\" that you smelled in the bathroom after your dad took your mom to the theater, is still in the identical-looking bottle that you would buy today, think again: since Dior is now part of LVMH, which in his blog Luca called \\" the Microsoft of the fragrance industry\\", all its famous perfumes have been re-formulated under the thin disguise of conforming with new regulations, yet in truth to squeeze out the last centime of profit by often substituting original high-quality ingredients with cheap large-volume synthetics. Which is where small niche perfumers come in who sell their creations either under their own name or as part of a growing boutique business that defines its success by offering uncompromising quality. While even 15 years ago, when Luca Turin's first Perfume buying guide appeared in France (and was never translated), one would have to travel to Paris or London to buy one of those hidden treasures, with internet-commerce in full swing all this is now at your fingertips. And that's where this book really shines and becomes a great help for all of those who already love perfume and want to explore a wider realm, or especially for those who always wondered if there was more than J-LO but needed to hold on to their dollars. Many entries among the nearly 1,500 reviews refer to offerings by those very boutique houses you had never heard of, but who will define the world of fragrance from here on, by bringing quality and originality back to the longing but so far mis-informed consumer. I myself was once writing perfume-reviews for Glamor and Elle magazines and had to witness the editing-out of any trace of critical wording. Repeatedly, the editors would point out to me that they had to publish either glowing reviews or none at all, since the same issue would carry the ads for those very fragrances. And since advertising is the number one revenue generator for these rags, you don't want to bite the hand that feeds you. So, dear young reader and seeker of a scent that finally would make you feel being yourself, the next time you consider throwing in one of those magazines at the supermarket checkout, save your dollars and instead spend them on this wonderful, irreverent, entertaining, witty, and most-of-all very informative book.translated), one would have to travel to Paris or London to buy one of those hidden treasures, with internet-commerce in full swing all this is now at your fingertips.

B0010YSD7M|5.0|I was delighted to find that this movie is as good as the series, and has some loose ends tied up.  Great Stargate movie. . . and I could foresee some others in the future, possibly.  (I hope so!)  Sorry to see this series of shows end.  Love the actors, and actresses!  I highly recommend you buy it, if you're an avid fan, or not.
B0000004V2|5.0|I love this album, recently purchased it like 2 months back and this cd is always in rotation in my car, theres one song i usually skip over and its the reversed track of \\"Dont Stop\\" not even that its a bad song but not really in the mood when im driving usually to hear it, other than that all these songs i love. I can definelty hear the influence of these guys on all the brit pop bands to come after them especially in The Verve and Oasis..    Excelent album recomend to anyone who likes genuinely good pop rock music

B00006RU5B|5.0|When I heard RATM was gaining Chris Cornell as the lead vocalist for their new band Audioslave, I was a little wary...I was never into Soundgarden all that much, however, I think Cornell is great in Audioslave...This album I particularly like, as most of my favorite Audioslave songs(Cochise, and Bring Em' Back Alive) are on it. They have good lyrics, and Morello's solos are very innovative and intriguing(although not as good as RATM). A great band for the casual rock listener, and I highly recommend it!
B00005JPLW|5.0|IF YOU LIKE GRAPHIC BATTLES, THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU. A MIX OF FACTS AND FICTION. I WATCHED THE MOVIE BEFORE I WATCHED THE SPECIAL FEATURES DISC. AFTER I WATCHED THE SPECIAL FEATURES DISC, I WATCHED THE MOVIE AGAIN. IT WAS LIKE WATCHING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AGAIN. AND WHAT A GREAT STORY. MAKES YOU WISH YOU WERE GREEK. YOU KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO END. BUT JUST LIKE WITH THE MOVIE TROY, YOU'LL BE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I like this album because the cd is almost as round as Karl Pilkington's head.
B00000612G|5.0|This is the second Richie Sambora album and very well worth investing in... it has slightly more of a rock vibe than the Stranger in this town which to me has a rock vibe but with a strong laid black blues sound.  Richie Sambora may be most known for his integral part of the band Bon Jovi but both albums prove without a doubt he is an incredible solo artist as well.    Definately a must have for all.  Highly recommend (both albums)    A Totally AWESOME album :)
B00005MP58|5.0|This production is a masterpiece of the time period with high quality actors in the roles. It held my interest throughout the film, the characters are realistic, and believable. Colin Firth (Mr. Darcy) is a brilliant British actor. Personally, I find him much more attractive and appealing in Darcy's role than Sir Lawrence Olivier's performance. Firth's stature, manners, bearing, dark good looks, brusqueness, yet emotional insecurity combines well with Ehle's confident personality as Elizabeth for their on-screen \\"attraction\\"-- a perfect match. I was kept guessing, though had a niggling feeling they would eventually come together and discover their attraction, and that they are just right for each other.    The actress playing the four girl's mother kept me laughing (or snickering) at her marvelous interpretation of the mother's personality: a person who is a bit ditsy, always on the verge of hysteria and ill equipped to deal with the problems that arise having four young women as daughters that she is MOST determined \\"to marry off\\" to men worthy of them, in her eyes. The father is wonderfully portrayed as calm, sensible, good natured, tolerant toward his wife, and  most capable of making excellent decisions regarding his children and their financial circumstances--if only his wife would allow him to get a word in edgewise and listen to his wisdom (though possible only infrequently). The sisters were well cast, particularly Jennifer Ehle; she's perfect as Elizabeth Bennet. She has her head together combined with very spirited wit and verbal reparte skills; she is so calm, cool, collected, and wise. \\"Her feathers aren't easily ruffled\\" by anyone, and she always has a quick, appropriate retort readily available when someone oversteps social decorum or attempts to put her or her family down in some way. You keep wondering whether Firth and Ehle will discover that in reality, they are perfect for each other if they'd just open their hearts to the possibility, rather thanconstantly bantering with each other over moot points while conversing. Extremely well done production--must see!
B0012QI4E0|5.0|Airbourne rocks!  Heard one song on the radio and called the station to find out who the artist was.  Immediately downloaded the CD and what an excellent CD it was.  Great music and lyrics.  This is a \\"throw back\\" to a great age of music.  Airbourne seems very AC/DC inspired but definitely has a personality of their own.  I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys anything from classic rock to \\"today's\\" rock music.
B000002G23|5.0|Message in a Box is an amazing box set, with every song The Police have ever played, and it is all neatly placed in chronological order. The Box Set also comes with a biography of the band, from their humble beginnings as a pseudo punk group, to the amazing Reggaesque group that epitamized there career. Sting and The Police were lyrical geniuses, and were candid when discussing anything from temptation(Don't Stand So), obsession(Every Breath You Take), and even the misery of war(Canary in a Coalmine, and Invisible Sun). For any classic rock listener out there, I highly recommend this band, it just kicks butt!
B000Y179KO|5.0|After reading some reviews that this is their best work ever, I said yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all before of some dude listening with rose colored earplugs. After buying this CD I must agree. Beautiful music is in the ears of the beholder but I must say this could very well be their best work up to date. It's rare when I buy a CD that I could listen to the whole thing and not program my CD player to just listen to a couple of songs on each CD.
B00003CY0V|2.0|Well, I'm seeing this movie about seven years after its premiere so that should tell you something. I'm pretty sure all the other reviewers have given a synopsis of the plot and storyline, so I won't rehash that. I will just share my opinions.  For having such an all-star, big bucks cast, this movie was incredibly uninspired.  None of the actors, except maybe Hugh, seemed to embrace the characters.  When a movie has a thin, boring plot, typically the portrayals are all that's left in order for the audience to not feel cheated, but you could have taken aspiring theater majors and done the same thing.  Travolta's character was an arrogant psychopath with an ugly goatee.  He played the maniac much better in Face Off.  Hugh, oh how I love Hugh Jackman, but he just simply wasn't believable as a hacker and even more so every time the camera showed him clicking keys.Halle...her part didn't add anything to the story. I remember all the press about her \\"first naked shots,\\" and it was obviously a cheap ploy to get horny guys into the theaters. Don Cheadle, well I just expect that Don was in it for the payday. He has had much better roles.      The twist at the end isn't really a twist when it's been done soooo many times before.  It reminded me of so many movies: Speed, Mission Impossible 1& 2, The Thomas Crown Affair, etc.      I had such high hopes too, b/c as everyone has said, the opening sequence was incredible. From John Travolta's monologue (was that prophetic or what?) to the 180-deg explosion. I thought we were in for a ride. Such a letdown. It was extra punishment as I try to watch movies til the end unless I really hate it or find it offensive. So I suffered through.    So seven years later, I finally got to see what the hype was about, and it wasn't worth it. I would usually say a movie sucked, but for Swordfish, it seems like something you'll figure out about 30 minutes into it.  I would only recommend Swordfish if you are bored or need background noise.
B00000K3D4|5.0|A Fantastical Quest Through the Labyrinth of Time. This Henson/Lucas production isn't quite what you'd expect from these legendary directors. Somehow, it's better.<br /><br />The genius of Henson and Lucas shines brightly as Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie perpetuate this wonderful tale of fantasy written by Dennis Lee and Jim Henson. Henson's son, Brian (now the head of the Henson Empire), even gets in on the act as the voice of Hoggle.<br /><br />The story opens in the present, this world, this plane. Sarah (Connelly) is a spoiled rotten little drama queen who thinks she is the center of the universe and the sun around which the world revolves.<br /><br />In a brattish fit of colossal immaturity, she stumbles upon the correct words to summon Jareth the Goblin King (Bowie) to take her little brother to the Goblin Realm.<br /><br />Once done; however, she realizes how angry her parents will be and decides that it's more prudent to go \\"rescue\\" Toby rather than allow his assimilation into the Goblin fold.<br /><br />Jareth gives her 13 hours in which to find her way through an impossible labyrinth, fight her way through the Goblin City, and puzzle out the staircases of the Goblin Castle and save her half-brother.<br /><br />She is punished for arrogance, beguiled in her naivety, confused in her indecision and imprisoned for her quick, thoughtless decisions. \\"That's not FAIR!\\" is one of her most used and best delivered lines; used again and again, until it FINALLY sinks in that life just isn't fair.<br /><br />It is a warm, funny and enriching tale, once started. It's about growing up, accepting responsibility for your actions and choices and making them more wisely in the beginning, rather than cleaning up your messes as you go along.<br /><br />In the end, Sarah realizes all the infantile tantrums and childish toys are nothing but detritial remains of her otherwise out-lived childhood. She begins to stumble upon the reality that the important things are family, friends, and the responsibility that comes with making mature decisions. She throws away her immaturity and child-like selfishness to save her brother and thereby sets her feet back on the right path to adulthood and maturity.<br /><br />It's a wonderful \\"coming of age\\" movie, and perfect for its target audience: girls 9-13. But I must say that children and adults alike love this movie, worldwide. It's not ONLY for girls, but for anyone who loves fantasy. This movie is far superior to what most consider to be your standard \\"Muppet Movie.\\" It's one of my favorites.ions.

0517548232|4.0|Economics in One Lesson is a clear and concise explanation of opportunity cost and price incentives. This book is extremely useful as a supplemental text. The reason why is that most modern economics textbooks pass over opportunity cost too quickly. The basic idea of opportunity cost is easy, but students need to see how the opportunity cost concept applies universally.<br /><br />One way to learn opportunity cost is to read Cost and Choice, by JM Buchanan. Cost and Choice is a great little book, but it does not work well for an intro class. Bastiat wrote some classic essays on opportunity cost, but his work could be seen as a little dated. Of course, opportunity cost is itself timeless, but Bastiat aimed at explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning to a nineteenth century audience.<br /><br />Economics in One Lesson is a modern restatement of Bastiat's essays. Hazlitt writes to counter mid twentieth century Keynesian fallacies. This is an important aim. All to many of us believe that disasters like 9-11 and Katrina created jobs. Too many of us fail to see that the labor and capital that goes into reconstruction has forgone alternative uses. Too many of us believe that capital itself causes unemployment by replacing labor. Labor saved by capital has alternative uses. Even some economists can benefit from reading this book (if they have an open mind) because too few of us see how government spending and credit expansion can displace and distort private sector spending. This is not to say that the free markets never have any slack or are perfect, but the Old Keynesian belief that activist fiscal and monetary policy can permanently increase real GDP is not well founded. Any New Keynesian will tell you that Hazlitt was right about the Old Keynesian economic program.<br /><br />Hazlitt also does fine explaining the basics of price incentives and price and wage controls. Many people will object to what Hazlitt writes about wage and price controls on ideological grounds, but his reasoning is sound. Even pro-minimum wage economists like David Card and Alan Kreuger admit that large increases minimum wage rates must cause increased unemployment. This is a basic lesson of economic theory.<br /><br />The critics of this book generally do not know what they are talking about. Sure Hazlitt does not discuss externalities or asymmetric information, but EIOL is not a comprehensive text, it's a primer on opportunity cost and price/wage controls. Keynesian critics will find fault in its discussions of unemployment, but the fact of the matter is that virtually all economists now reject the Keynesian paradigm that Hazlitt attacked in 1946, including contemporary self described Keynesians. Hazlitt is second only to Bastiat in explaining the general applicability of opportunity cost reasoning in an entertaining fashion, and his book is more up to date. All first year economics students should read Economics in One Lesson., but his reasoning is sound. Even pro-minimum wage economists like David Card and Alan Kreuger admit that large increases minimum wage rates must cause increased unemployment. This is a basic lesson of economic theory.

1400082773|4.0|I bought this book to learn a bit more about Mr. Obama since he and Hilary Clinton are pretty well tied in the Democratic race at this point & I knew little about his early background.  This book gives a pretty good picture of his early years and offers a much deeper understanding of how he developed as a person.  I feel I know a great more about him than I did before reading this book.  It is not a complicated or hard to read story, rather it is pretty well much written in an almost simplistic style perhaps reflecting his attempt to be truthful and portray his early life as closely as he can remember.  Highly recommended to develop a more well rounded picture of the man running for president.

B0000639FE|5.0|Apparently, it can be very easy for an album or a film to take the world by storm and everyone gets to raving and talking about it and the success of the film almost seems bigger than the film itself. However, just because you're the biggest at the time, does that mean you were the best or just simply the most visible? Compare \\"Jerry Maguire\\", Cameron Crowe's first huge film to make massive business after the so-so successes of \\"Singles\\" and \\"Say Anything\\", to \\"Almost Famous\\", long considered Crowe's best work yet barely got any box office attention. But here we have the one that put him on the map and while some parts don't fit well, the overall film is quite solid after all these years.    Jerry Maguire is a sports agent that works behind the scenes that makes sure his clients get the best contracts in sports as well as top product endorsements. But over time, he realizes it's becoming more about the money and lying to clients and writes a \\"mission statement\\" which details his ideas to better the relationships between clients. While emotionally it makes sense, to everyone else it's absolutely ridiculous and he's promptly fired. But with help of Dorothy Boyd, a fellow co-worker moved by his writing and Rod Tidwell, a football player who believes he's not getting the life or respect he deserves, Jerry changes into what he wrote about but never acted on ever.    One of the most successful films and certainly one of the most quotable, it's easy to see Jerry Maguire being a success. Equal parts drama with many comedic moments, actor and character showcases as well as stuff romantics will gush over, it does have everything (well, there's no action scene to speak of but that's nothing). But it's kind of unfair since many would find overrated and a bit overexposed thanks to several lines of dialogue, its box office success or the fact its a Tom Cruise movie. It's not really the most flawless film since for every scene that feels just right, there's other parts where it doesn't really drag so much as they're just \\"there\\".    Acting-wise Tom Cruise has always been a curious case since not only his celebrity status but his press and behavior after awhile kind of overshadowed his acting talents. While I'll admit that some performances aren't the greatest, when he does shine he kind of pulls out the stops and Jerry's probably his most layered performance after Magnolia. We also have Renee Zellweger who's finally not annoying (Cold Mountain) or just used as a superstar than an actress (Bridget Jones). We get Cuba Gooding Jr. as the very loud and charismatic Tidwell and also roles by Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, and Jay Mohr.    The director's cut of Almost Famous entitled ironically \\"Untitled\\" is probably the best thing Crowe has his name attached to. The second would naturally be Jerry Maguire and while people might've gotten a little sick of the film, if you revisit after not seeing it for awhile like I have, you find the perfect date movie, or even just a movie for yourself.

6304981635|4.0|The 1973 film ENTER THE DRAGON was the first Hollywood kung fu film, placing the then little-known Bruce Lee among American actors and featuring a plot of international proportions.<br /><br />Of course, the Hong Kong roots of the genre still hold. The manaical supervillain Han (Shih Kien) is murdering young women on his private island. When Han organizes an international martial arts tournament, Lee is sent by the Hong Kong government to bust Han's operation. He is joined by American businessman Roper (John Saxon), hoping to get some money to pay off mafia debts, and black activist Williams (Jim Kelly), who just seeks victory and looking good.<br /><br />There's a great deal of humour in the story, beyond the traditional incompetent henchmen and improbably deft martial arts. I can't imagine that the film-makers did not intend that the viewer take the supervillain's tropes seriously. When Han strokes his cat while plotting his schemes, or when he gives one character a tour of his entire criminal enterprise before asking him to join them, we can't help but chuckle at this borrowings from James Bond. The film works well as mindless entertainment.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the film-makers succeeded in making a film that was more than a simple action outing. Two scenes made ENTER THE DRAGON a classic of cinema. In a scene where Bruce Lee wields nunchaku we are treated to one of the finest documents of athletic prowess, testimony that Lee was not just a simple action star but a great sportsman. The climax of the film, where Lee duels with Han in a hall of mirrors, is rich in symbolism and elegantly filmed, coming to influence many films since. And I personally, a recent visitor to Hong Kong and one passionately interested in the area, enjoyed seeing how Kowloon and Hong Kong Island looked before the boom era.<br /><br />I had a good time watching ENTER THE DRAGON and recommend to any who might be intrigued by a kung fu film that transcends its genre to some degree.
B000ZN802W|5.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart. It moved me in a way that few films do, in a way that may have changed me and the way I raise my children. This is the story of a young, disillusioned man coming of age in the 1990s, who flips off society and finds his own meaning of life. Traveling away from all he has known as his privileged destiny, he abandons everything in search of a new truth.<br /><br />Alexander Supertramp, an immediately lovable soul, takes us on his journey, and supplemented with important background information from his sister (narrator), breaks the heart of the viewer along with each character in the film--mile by mile. The musical score, film direction and beautiful cinematography make this an unforgettable work of art. Completely intrigued by this character--this person who lived and searched the earth for truth, AND found it--I will definitely read the book. Excellent work by all involved. Wow.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I stumbled onto Vampire Weekend on the internet and decided to get a preview of what this band could do, before I considered ordering the MP3 Album.  The vocals sounded catchy enough for me to gamble on them and I'm glad I did.      They have this harmonic  melody that enthralls you to listen to every track, with no breaks in between.  I read a review about someone saying that there were no memorable tracks, but I'd have to disagree.  There are quite a few songs that can easily become singles and the other songs are still pretty well polished.  The only con I could find was that there wasn't any more tracks, because I can't get enough of these guys.  If you're in a need for an album that you need to relax the soul, Vampire Weekend is for you.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|I've known some of the music from this for years. I've known the story for even longer. I've seen multiple presentations. But the rest paled in comparison to Tim Burton's version of 'Sweeny Todd'.  I never would have thought that Burton could have pulled this off and boy was I wrong.  Every now and then a winning combination happens. The cast, the sets and costumes, the score, director and everyone else involved have brought together this masterpiece.  No need going over the details, others have done it in their reviews. All I can say is that I was glued to the screen and grateful for this movie. Although the story is bizarre and macabre, there are a lot of life lessons in here. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, nor for children. And setting a horror story to music is indeed macabre in itself. But it all works here.  Must see. At least once. Highly recommended.

B000YABYLA|2.0|This movie has to be the perfect example of a hipster/scenester turned script writer. If this is what i have to look forward to in films that are considered \\"edgy and different\\" i'd rather watch the paint peel. Let's see what this film had working for itself- Juno- she is my high school nightmare. the edgy girl who has \\"eclectic\\" taste in music, who thinks she's original and talks with \\"witty\\" quips.....well, i didn't have any sympathy or connection to this character. I found her pretentious and annoying. This doesn't help when the film is titled after the main character. I thought the music in the film was ridiculous...and i have an open mind when it comes to music. i will be getting on my knees and praying that the hipster set doesn't start making movies in droves.
0345350499|5.0|I loved this story. I don't care if this Arthurian legend told through the eyes of the women behind the throne is the way it happened or not. I do know that experiences are different for each person who experiences them, and the re-telling of an event will certainly reflect that.<br /><br />That said, I loved the creative way Marion Zimmer Bradley put this story together. This was the first book I ever read of hers, and I did not want it to end. At times just when I thought the story might be beginning to drag, I was startled by an unexpected event, such as the time the high priestess Viviane was suddenly assassinated at a castle banquet by an angry member of Arthur's entourage by cloving her head in two with an axe. The story is full of romance, sexual tension, deceit and power ploys, which all make for an exciting story if told well - and I found this story to be one of the most captivating fiction works I've read. Romance, obligation and intrigue begin well before Arthur is born, as his mother Igraine is attracted to a man from another culture despised by her husband, who later ends up becoming Arthur's father.<br /><br />I particularly liked the merging of the magical elements with the more earthly aspects of managing a kingdom that ultimately is most empowered by its spiritual leaders, whether from its goddess culture heritage, or the new fathers of Christianity.  The struggle between the two forces accelerates throughout the book, as the women of the priestess tradition feel their own time of power slipping away.  The section where Arthur's half-sister Morgaine was missing for ten years and experienced it as a time warp of only three days was another fascinating part of the story that continued to artfully mix magic with the mundane life most of the others were living.<br /><br />Morgaine's son Mordred, the twisted result of a manipulated liasion between she and Arthur, takes the story to an even more scandalous level near the end of the book. This story is too rich with detail and imagery to do it justice in a review. I suspect this story it will find its most enthusiastic readers mostly among women, but so what? Men have certainly had their share of stories that favored the male viewpoint so I say it's about time.<br /><br />Readers, enjoy this wonderfully scandalous, engaging and captivating story. It's a true escape to another time and place. I highly recommend it.d imagery to do it justice in a review.

It will be familiar to most movie-goers, which is that there's been a world-wide epidemic of zombies that caused the near end of civilization.      The author is definitely creative, and provides plenty of variety in telling the story through the eyes of the survivors.  For instance, there's a blind old man that lives in a park by himself where he was able to fight off the undead.  Or the film-maker that records these horribly inefficient laser weapons simply for their cool effect of vaporizing zombies.    Inside jokes about the Iraq War are hilarious, such as this one given by a soldier pointing out how zombies don't carry guns:  \\"And what genius thought to put us in body armor anyway?  Because the press reamed 'em for not having enough in the last war?\\"    The overall history does come together - you have infection, panic, and finally war.  And there are allusions between the different interviews to connect them (such as the \\"decimation\\" of Russian soldiers, which literally meant executing every 1-in-10 of them).    The problem is that it still feels disconnected, and there are so many characters that they mostly blend together.  Also, the interview-format rules out any suspense, since you know that character will live despite the overwhelming odds.    I did like this book, but I wouldn't consider it top-notch horror.
B00132D808|5.0|While the first effort produced some promising tunes, I had a real hard time following any kind of meaning or significance to the lyrics or the plastic-synthesized instrumentation. I knew they had talent based on the abilities of Brendon Urie and the aforementioned catchiness of the music itself, but I wanted there to be more substance to the whole package. The sophomore album seems to have cured all of these.    Coming through with a vastly matured array of lyrics (ones that weren't penned when the band was still high school aged) as well as instruments, Panic! has made some necessary changes that helped form a sincere collection of tracks that completely transcends the well-received album from 2005.     Just compare these snippets between the first and second album:     From 'A Fever You Can't Sweat Out'  I Write Sins Not Tragedies    Oh, well imagine: as I'm pacing the pews in a church corridor,  And I can't help but to hear,  No, I can't help but to hear an exchanging of words:  \\"What a beautiful wedding!\\"  What a beautiful wedding, says the bridesmaid to a waiter.  \\"Yes, but what a shame...  What a shame, the poor groom's bride is a whore.\\"    I'd come in with a  \\"Haven't you people ever heard of closing the goddamn door?!\\"  No, it's much better to face these kinds of things  With a sense of poise and rationality.    From Pretty. Odd.  'Folkin' Around'      Allow me to exaggerate a memory or two  Where summer's lasted longer than  Longer than we do  Where nothing really mattered except for me to be with you  But in time we all forgot and we all grew    Your melody sounds as sweet as the first time it was sung  With a little bit more character for show  And by the time your father's heard of all the wrong you've done  Then I'm putting out the lantern  Find your own way back home.        Don't tell me at least their lyrics haven't matured. If I could compare the 2 with audio, I'd do the same.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a simply amazing series and it just shows the idiocy of the network that it was on that they canceled it.  I would recommend this to any fan who enjoys anything from the Loan Ranger, Battle star Galatica, Starwars or Star Trek.  The dry humor from the main character is wonderful and the actors and actresses are first rate.
B000F3UAFC|2.0|I am a big movie fan and especially period pieces but this was a sorry movie! Helen Hunt delivered her lines with less emotion than a waitress behind the counter of Denny's. Her voice tones are great for sarcasm but for meaning and depth lines it stinks.    Johansson was as pale as a ghost. Sure she was a very young innocent but she needed some rouge. I also thought she looked downright ugly and dowdy in this movie. Altho the costumes were beautiful she was an ugly ducklying standout.    The whole movie lacked the delicate touch and nuance a Wilde story should have. Helen Hunt was the biggest standout as missed casting. She may do in cutting edge stories in 2000 but not in this period piece.    The scenery and costumes were about the only redeeming factor in this movie.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|It reminds me in some aspects to many of his past masterpieces, like Tubular Bells, Ommadawn and QE2, using a good Orchestra, on a very first class scenario, on Bilbao's Gugenheim Arts Museum as scenario. It's a kind of walk across his past masterpieces.    It should be used as a film soundtrack.    Very good sound quality, altough I miss a Collector's Edition DVD, with the video in 5.1 and special features.    I found it a little bit short, but of a very good quality. As usual, Mike likes to introduce a base melody and plays with it all along the disc on many ways (as anyone else can), as he did in the past with Amarokk.    I am looking forward a disc that does not use at all the concept of Tubular Bells, and use instead of it, the Incantations scheme. A really breakthrough masterpiece.    Good Job, Mike! It was a quite fine job!!    \\"Buy it!, You will not be disapointed\\".
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|LOVED the Lethal Weapon movies.  The price was awesome!  At first, couldn't figure out why it was so much cheaper than the others, so I was a bit leery of it.  The only difference was the box was thinner than the normal box and instead of 4 discs, you get 2 disc, a movie on each side.  Still played great, so no complaints there.
B00012L786|5.0|***** 1953. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller. One nomination for the Academy awards (Thelma Ritter). A pickpocket steals a microfilm without knowing it. Cops, F.B.I. and communists are soon after him. Criterion released a perfect copy of this movie that should be in any movie lover's library. Two rare interviews of Samuel Fuller complete this DVD. Masterpiece.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Yes, it is similar to most teen movies, which have actors way too old to look like they're in high school, and plots that probably never happen in real life, but this movie has a lot of great humor, spectacular acting, a superb soundtrack, and that little something that makes you melt in your seat every time you watch it. This movie is definitely not to be missed!
1401322336|5.0|The intention of this book is to be a beginner's guide for cooking, and it is just that.  The book allows you to cook with confidence because you finally understand why certain things are done and why they work so well.  Although this is a beginner's guide, it should not deter seasoned cooks from reading.  There are many great and handy basic recipes that it remains a book that every cook can enjoy.  As a bonus you can enjoy Jaime's excitement about the joy of cooking and using quality ingredients.
6305882592|5.0|\\"Harold and Maude\\" is a delightful, funny, moving, off-beat black comedy with a lot of heart. It is also one of the best and unusual on-screen romances I've seen. If the opposites attract each other, there have not been perhaps more different in every possible way screen couple than 20 years old Harold (Bud Cort) and Maude(charming, clever, multi-talented Ruth Gordon, the Oscar winning actress and three times Oscar nominee for writing) who is just about to turn 80. Harold is a rich kid who is obsessed with death and likes to stage very believable and hilarious succession of suicide attempts to impress his unflappable socialite mother who got used to them and not impressed anymore. Harold's others hobbies are driving the hearse and to attend funerals where he meets one day a woman who will change his life forever, 79 years young free-spirit, rebel, and fighter for \\"Liberty. Rights. Justice\\", Maude. She also likes to attend the funerals of the strangers. We won't learn much about Maude's life story but there will be one visual flash which gives us a very good idea that Maude knew a lot about death, losses, and suffering but she chose to celebrate, worship, and enjoy life to the fullest. This short poignant moment is a stroke of genius, and there are many of them in the truly unique, one of its kind movie. Maybe Hal Ashby had brought some of memories from his own childhood that included the divorce of his parents, his father's suicide, his dropping out of high school, getting married and divorced all before he was 19, into \\"Harold and Maude\\". Hal Ashby had made a series of memorable, intelligent, well acted films in the 70s, that included The Last Detail (1973), Shampoo (1975), Bound for Glory (1976), Coming Home (1978) and Being There (1979) but it is \\"Harold and Maude\\" that has become the cult classic from the first days of its release and it more than deserves its status. The movie also benefits tremendously from the soundtrack of songs by Cat Stevens.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|This is a great movie to watch once.  After you see the ending you wont want to watch it again not even with someone else who havent seen it. A deffinite rent but I wouldnt buy it. Acting, story, and plot is great!
B0010V4TZU|2.0|I have a theory that the people who like this album are hearing how this band channels influences they like and really like those influences.  So, the concept here - mix some Paul Simon with some Elvis Costello with a sort of Beach Boys/prep club vibe is a winner.  The execution, unfortunately, falls way, way short, which I guess is easier to ignore than one would think.     But play two tracks from Graceland by Paul Simon and anything by Elvis Costello; then listen to this album. You'll notice that there just doesn't seem to be much energy, hooks, or singalong material.  It's background music for a really lame party you throw when your old college friends get back together and talk about their investment banking jobs.    I like the musical direction.  I really do.  Conceptually.  But, again, the problem is in the execution.  The performances sound like first take material.  The lyrics fall flat.  Rather than the poetic turns of phrase of Paul Simon, you get lines like:     \\"I didn't like the business,  But that was at first glance  Your pillow feels so soft now  But still you must advance\\"     (from The Kids Don't Stand A Chance)    The lyrics fail to paint much of a picture of anything. They are random comments of people and situations we aren't told enough to care about.  Links aren't made. Time isn't taken to create a world we can believe in through the blending of sound, texture, and poetic imagery.  It's not even vacuous dance music or fun, pointless garage band throwaway songs.    Ladies of Cambridge, the B-Side off of the Mansard Roof single is actually more alive than the material on the album proper.  Yet, \\"A morbid streak runs through the whole of my family.\\"  So says our intrepid vocalist in a blatant attempt to rip-off Morrissey.    Morbid is nowhere near this music.  Lame ska is more the flair (or lack thereof).  The choice of band names, while I realize is supposed to be ironic, still makes one wonder if the lads originally thought they were forming agoth band and then, through a major case of hyperactive attention deficit disorder, got sidetracked into pablum pop disguised as 'new wave'.    Hint:  new wave is long over.  And those who compare this band to Talking Heads and The Police - again, please listen to the source material.  Then, listen to this band.  You will find stark differences.  For instance, while Sting wrote some of the great lyrics of the late 20th Century, this person from this band seems to have written some words down so he would have something to sing when the band plays.    Overall, this album is all bland, washed out water color paintings of life for supposed elites in New York, Massachusetts and elsewhere (not Africa, by the way - there is not even a hint of danceable rhythm here).      But, here's my caveat... if you really don't care about what you're listening to much and want to do the fashionable thing, please, please, please, you must pick this CD up and play it at your next yacht party.      If you want to be reminded of good bands (by the way, no one has destroyed all their albums, you can still purchase them and listen to the real thing - or, better yet, they are probably already in your CD collection - so dust them off already), please, really... get this album.      But don't expect to hear anything new or authentic.
B000TGELLY|4.0|Some inaccuracies in the legend, but that's movie making for you.  I loved the epic scale and how the story was told.  Eric Bana is simply astounding as Hector.
B000V6S8P2|5.0|I listen to this soundtrack at least once a week. If you love Buffy, and especially of course the musical episode, you should really get this. It makes every listen worthwhile.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I have given this CD as a gift many times.  This is our all time favorite CD.  I ordered it for a hostess gift for St. Patrick's Day event and it was received with enthusiasm.  We never get tired of the music, songs, or the taleneted ladies who preform.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|\\"There will be Blood\\" explores the oil boom in early-20th century America via its character profile of oil baron Daniel Plainview portrayed by Daniel Day Lewis. A man who literally dug his first oil strike with his own hands, Plainview becomes a swindler and, eventually, a murderer. He twists the oil out of the land by taking advantage of rural people who are too naive to understand his purposes. He goes head-to-head with rural fundamentalist preacher, Eli Sunday who is one of the few people able to understand Plainview's corruption, but who later falls victim to corporate greed himself. Upton Sinclair wrote the original novel upon which this film is based, \\"Oil\\". Daniel Day Lewis embeds himself in the corporate robber baron, Plainview. This is one of the towering performances of the 21st century.<br /><br />A great film with a stunningly inventive musical score -- electronic and mechanical. Set aside 3 hours and see \\"There Will Be Blood\\".

B00111YM5G|2.0|I had some hopes for this movie when I picked it up, but after about an hour, my hopes became more concentrated on watching the timer drag slowly towards the 114 minute mark.  This was a very disapointing film and the twist at the end was pretty weak I thought.  All the arch angels of Heaven could not fight the forces of darkness in Purgatory, a place where the souls of people who's fate has not yet been decided go.  I didn't know that that is what Purgatory was supposed to be.  God can't make up his mind?  Anyway, why were the fates of these souls undecided.  They were practicing rapists, theives, killers and prostitutes.   They were drug dealers and sellers of illegal firearms.  They shouldn't have been in Purgatory if the only criteria is that God has not decided on where they should spend eternity.  Anyway, the forces of darkness have taken over and arch angels from Heaven (or THE LIGHT as they called it. I guess because they had to be politically correct and not use words like God, Supreme Being, Creator etc.) were sent down one by one to defeat the forces of darkness and bring light back to Purgatory.  Six archangels fail and Gabriel is the last one.  When he arrives he becomes a warrior in a post-apocolytic looking city or something.  I found it troubling that the weapons of choice by angels would be knives and guns and bombs and lead pipes.  It was hard to accept this place as Purgatory.   Anyway, the movie has it's moments when Jade is rescued, then plays not much of a part any more in the picture and when Raphael is healed.  After that, the film is a series of ever increasingly boring fight scenes, including the final climactic one which seemed to take...well, it took an eternity for goodness sake.  This isn't really an unwatchable film but I would not recommend it to anyone and for sure would never consider owning it.
1596680296|4.0|I purchased this book as I decided that it was about time that knitting socks would no longer intimadate me.  While I think that the book is informative and I found a few sock patterns I would like to attempt to try once I learn the basic.  I need something more of a teaching book.  I would recommed this book for anyone who already knows how to knit socks.
B000051VWW|5.0|I love every song on this CD! My two favorite's are Every Word and By Your Side. I've been listening to this CD for years and never get tired of it. I love it! :)
0143038419|2.0|I was watching Oprah one day and the author of this book was on.  After listening to the said interview, I ordered this book.  It was interesting.
0375505091|1.0|I was very excited to win this book as a prize for a photo contest tied to the Annie Liebowitz exhibit in SF, CA. My photo was related to families. I acknowledge the other reviewers. The graphic layout of the photos reduced the value of her beautiful work. This book is important. It's production should have accorded it the same treatment. Who was in charge of its publication? Was Annie consulted? I can't imagine it. Actually it would make me feel better to think that she wasn't included in the approval cycle; how could you do this to yourself?
B0000042GM|5.0|While there may be recordings of individual works in this set that equal these by Katchen (by the likes of Richter, Michelangeli, Gilels and Arrau), you would be hard pressed to find any that clearly surpass them. In other words, Katchen plays Brahms like Rubinstein played Chopin - that is, better than everyone else. That, of course, doesn't mean these should be the only versions of these works you need, but it is the perfect place to start. Katchen does take the sonatas at a slightly faster tempo than Richter, but each line is still clearly articulated. Most box sets have their peaks and valleys, but this one is fairly even throughout. Also highly recommendable for Brahms fans are Katchen's violin sonatas with Josef Suk and piano trios with Suk and Janos Starker.
0385338724|5.0|All I have to say this was so good that I hope they turn it into a movie!
0670018651|2.0|This is a fun read for maybe a half hour, and then it becomes a bit repetitious.  As much as I love perfume, I found myself getting bored with the reviews, and not long after realized I don't really care what either Turin or Sanchez have to say these scents.  And no, it's not because we disagree on many things.  We're actually in agreement on quite a few things... I just don't care.      Having read some of Turin's earlier reviews, I think I was hoping for a collection of very pointy, entertaining and pithy takes on scents, his trademark blend of sharp wit, industry insight and facile tongue.  But this feels watered down for some reason.  Sanchez is an excellent writer, and she does a lovely job with the essays up front, but I think some of us might've secretly been hoping for a heftier dose of Turin's insights and prose.  I think I was, I just didn't realize it before I bought the book.      And yes, in case you hadn't already decided that perfume appreciation is a wildly subjective animal, this book will help you come to that conclusion.  As another reviewer said, I hope perfume newbies don't take this as the perfume gospel or as a manual of perfume taste; they should learn to trust their own noses.  Their reactions to scents are just as valid as anyone's, even if they're not as informed or experienced as Turin and Sanchez, and maybe because of it.    As I like to say, to thine own nose to be true!
074356619X|4.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD, though it is often repetive.  It is motivational, and reminds us of the importance of thinking of the goal, instead of focusing on what is holding us back and the negative things in life.  However, like everything, it is not a cure all and must be used in moderation.  Yes, thinking bad thoughts frequently may make it more likely for you to have bad events happen to you, and even to get cancer.  However, the reverse is not true.  Cancer does not happen only to people who think bad thoughts, and environmental disasters do not selectively effect only those people in town who were not thinking positively.  Overall, it is a good reminder of the power of positive thought, personal empowerment and personal responsibility.   I think in our victim oriented society, many people can benefit from the idea that what happens in their lives is strongly related to what they think and do, though it should be listened to or read with a \\"grain of salt\\".  Following the principles of \\"The Secret\\" does help one to succeed in life, generally.  In real life though, nothing is foolproof.
B0007DPZMI|5.0|I cannot believe I never heard of this masterpiece until this past year. I do not usually like books that are this sad, but \\"Stoner\\" grabbed me from the first page and never let go. The writing is unadorned yet elegant and the story, although sad, is so compelling and real.<br /><br />Stoner is a man who never achieved much in life, with a failed marriage and not much success as a faculty member at the university. But he never gave up on life. He worked hard at his teaching and became the best that he could be. His life was one constant struggle, with much self-sacrifice, but he kept on trying despite one disappointment after another.<br /><br />It was amazing to me that Williams made me care so much about this man whom some would call a \\"loser\\". As the New York Times reviewer said \\"a perfect book\\"....a fascinating story of a man and how he lives his life.
0143038419|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I'm sad to say that it was a huge waste of money and this woman should never have had a book deal to begin with. She is whiny and self-centered and I'm sorry that I had to read anything about her shallow life.
0670018651|4.0|Fragrance is a highly subjective experience, and this is a book of opinions -- by two finely tuned and highly experienced noses. Anyone expecting an empirical, entirely objective \\"guide\\" on this subject will be waiting a long time. Thankfully, Turin and Sanchez are also gifted writers; the descriptions are unfailingly colorful, succinct, and evocative -- so although my taste differs from theirs in many respects, I always find their observations illuminating and fun to read. The book targets aficionados rather than novices, I think, although newcomers should enjoy the exploration, too; there are a few chemical references, but the authors also include a long explanatory introduction, a glossary, and a few top ten lists at the end. This compares very favorably to Jan Moran's \\"Fabulous Fragrances\\" and others of that starry-eyed, scent-shilling ilk. Turin and Sanchez are not afraid to smash a few icons, praise some very unlikely candidates, and rail against the reformulation of some gorgeously eccentric classics. The only improvement would be an expanded version; but fragrances proliferate so fast these days that any guide is outdated before it's even published. Anyone for Part 2?
1400082773|5.0|This book really touched my heart.  I've enjoyed reading it for many reasons:  portrays a perspective to help me to understand many things, I've learned things in this book that I wouldn't have thought of regarding my own family.  The book overall really lets us reflect on our own lives. It also helps us to understand where Senator Obama's strength comes from, which Colleges he attended, the dedication of his family towards his well being, shows us he's got strength, energy, and intelligence to pull through anything.  That's what we want in a President.   Laura S.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Accelerate, the newest album from REM, is the kind of album that a person has to listen to several times before you can start to pass judgment. On my first listen through the album I came away somehwat dissapointed, however, with each subsequent listen, the album grew stronger. The return of Peter Buck's guitar is especially welcome. Let's hope that they don't wait several years before releasing their next album, because if they stick to the formula that was used on Accelerate, it will be a winner as well. My only complaint with the album is the length. I wish they could have put a couple of more songs on it.
B000R4SMCW|2.0|The most enlightenment I got from this film was reading the Amazon promotional material, which indicates well-known critics like Rex Reed called this film \\"smart\\" and interesting. I found little of either in this boring rehash of roles Anthony Hopkins has lived off since his Hanibal Lechter days merged with a dull courtroom drama.<br /><br />Hopkins is an aerodesigner that kills his wife, who's had an affair. He manages to get even with the guy that cuckolded him during the investigation and is tried by hotshot prosecutor Ryan Gosling, a walking, gum-chewing, guffawing cliche of one of Hollywood's great archetypes. Mr. Cliche gets surprised by the way Hanibal, er Hopkins, sets up the crime so he can't be found guilty (in fact, he can't even be tried.)<br /><br />But, wait, as they say in the infomercials, there are a bunch of twists coming that will give you satisfaction. Turns out prosecutor Gosling isn't as dumb as he looks and Hanibal II isn't as smart as he looks. So guess what? They do find a way to try him for his crime after all.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the two paragraphs above comprise the sum and substance of this really bad movie. I don't recall when this made its appearance at the theaters but it couldn't have made much of an indent. The action, what there is of it, is slow-moving, full of holes in its logic, and so predictable you'll figure it out in about a half-hour. The ending is one of Hollywood's greatest traps -- it does nothing more than set the ground for the sequel, which I'm sure was filmed same time they did this one.<br /><br />Save your money, time and energy and pass on this dog. The alleged \\"humor\\" in the script isn't funny, either. People that confuse cynicism with humor don't have very good senses of humor and that's what you have to do to think any lines in \\"Fracture\\" are funny.
B00006WKSZ|5.0|In the 1970s, rock and roll live records were at their peak. Peter Frampton was acheiving huge success with his 'Frampton Comes Alive!' record, which documented a concert he gave in San Francisco. Led Zeppelin was acheiving commercial success with the soundtrack to their concert film, 'The Song Remains The Same.' And of course, Lynyrd Skynyrd had 'One More From The Road.'    But, what always puzzles me is the fact that Scorpions' incredible live record 'Tokyo Tapes' is always left in the dust.     This is an essential record documenting the legendary heavy metal band's shows recorded in Japan in late 1978. The record was released in 1978 on the RCA label, but I see Hip-O has remastered it.    I still own the vinyl of this, and I have looked at the track listing and noticed that 'Polar Nights' was left off. But I'm not bothered at all; as the previous reviewer pointed out, that appears on the reissued version of 'Taken By Force.' And, that wasn't one of the highlights (to me) on this disc anyway.    I have listened to the tracks and I am shocked with how well Hip-O did at remastering this. 'In Trance' sounds better than it ever had before; 'Steamrock Fever' still has the same charm it had 30 years ago, and the cover of the legendary Japanese folk song 'Kojo No Tsuki' is really interesting.    Overall, if you're a Scorpions fan who hasn't invested your money in one of their live records, than this set is highly recommended. Buy it with 'World Wide Live!' and you have a great Scorpions live collection.     A great live record and a must-have. Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!
0143038419|3.0|Boy, if only we all had an opportunity like this in our lives to take a year off of work and travel the world!  Ok, jealousy aside...Eat, Pray, Love was an interesting book, pretty well-written, but it didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />I guess I just found this book dragging at times, well, quite often.  I didn't feel the emotions well enough from the author, I didn't \\"get\\" her.  So, this is probably why this was only an OK read for me.  I just couldn't relate or find inspiration in what I was reading.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to a friend.  Again, it wasn't horrible, it just didn't hold my interest and it certainly didn't meet my expectations with seeing it on all the hot-sellers lists in the last year.  Oh well.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Taking from an amazing book, this movie really put the story to life. The imagery and music really hit home. If you have a love for the outdoors, or always wanted to, this movie will touch you, move you, and impact your life. Eddie Vedder's voice and instrumentals enhanced the movie dramatically.    If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you put this one on your list. It is my favorite of the year.

B0014DBZT2|3.0|There comes a time when a great songwriter's work eventually builds a monument of such indisputable glory that fans and media alike exchange objective criticism for the kind of polite noise everyone's making about the latest from Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, Dig!! Lazarus Dig!!!, as if to handle their work with the remotest honesty is to befoul the names of the gods. Let me make one thing clear: Nick Cave has without any doubt attained the heights of rock `n roll divinity, but that doesn't mean he can't be pulled to the ground when he asks for it. And with Lazarus, he doesn't just ask-he begs.<br /><br />The several talking songs on Lazarus (like \\"Night of the Lotus Eaters\\" or the title track) betray a presumptuousness that undercuts Cave's performances here, a combination of indifference and indulgence that suggests Nick's been reading his own clippings. Instead we get a self-congratulatory Cave luxuriating in the density of his own chiseled lines while spitting stale similes like \\"you came on like a punch in the heart,\\" accidentally stumbling here and there into a vocal melody that almost approximates song. The band accompanies Cave in a drunken nausea of whiny violins and one-chord riffs that condemn most tracks to the monotone rut Cave is so clearly steeped in. At times, as on the entirely discordant \\"Midnight Man\\" or \\"Moonland,\\" the band simply collapses into an unlistenable jazz of dispassion. It's all noise and no nuance this time around-the exact inversion of everything Cave fans expect of this otherwise brilliant man.<br /><br />When Cave released the jam-packed double album Abattoir Blues in 2004, a mature masterpiece that integrated the blistering abandon of his Birthday Party days with the brooding balladry of Boatman's Call, he suggested that fans ought to listen to disc one first, and then resort to disc 2 only when they grew hungry for a new Nick Cave album.

B0013FXWU6|1.0|I watched the movie with my husband. The beginning was fine. It slowly escalated from one sick feeling to another. I thought to myself, what was this writer thinking? Who wrote this? It is very disturbing. It was too long  of a movie especially when there were no happy moments. It was nothing but Greed, Violence, Anger, Betrayal, Jealousy, Hate, you know the rest. I could not find the light in this movie, very dark spiritually. I do not recommend. I Hated the movie!!! :(:(:(
0553582038|2.0|I greatly enjoy the first few books in the series and was greatly surprised when I read this one. It seems Martin was too daring and bold with his killing off of main characters in the previous books in the series. Now what we are left with are mostly uninteresting characters and some of the characters that we have come to love have changed enough that they seem like a different person altogether. Killing off interesting main characters is not the problem it's when an author chooses to clean house and gets rid of MOST of the characters that actually made the stories so great is really the problem. We could loss one or two good characters but Martin killed so many of them. This book really does feel like a different book entirely from the series. I'm hoping the next book will introduce some new and more interesting characters.
6305076995|4.0|Performed and recorded a few months after the release of 'Close to the Edge' and the abrupt departure of drummer Bill Bruford, this show represents Yes as it crested on a tidal wave of critical acclaim and creativity.<br /><br />The standards are all here, of course, with the band performing 'Your Move/All Good People', 'Close to the Edge', 'And You and I', 'Roundabout', 'Yours is No Disgrace' etc. but there are, in my opinion at least, some serious omissions here.  Yes would have been well served to have left out Howe's solo rendition of 'Clap' and Wakeman's theatrical 'Excerpts from Six Wives of Henry the VIII' and instead included, for instance, 'Heart of the Sunrise' and 'Siberian Khatru'- both breathtakingly performed on the Yessongs album but, for reasons unknown, not the movie.  Likewise, the cheesy special effects interspersed with 'Close to the Edge' are unbelievably annoying, especially when the dry ice and mist encloses the stage and performers during the composition's beautifully ethereal middle section.<br /><br />The editing and production could have been better with some scenes not properly synchronized with the sound.  I also found the looping of the applause track to be disconcerting and an unnecessary form of cheap hype.  There are also far too many scenes focusing on Steve Howe - his face, his fingers, his prancing around the stage and not enough of Chris Squire or Rick Wakeman.  Alan White is portrayed the least probably to assuage Bill Bruford fans.<br /><br />The performances themselves are capable but I can never understand why the band insisted on playing each song at double its normal tempo.  Combine that with the muddy sound quality and you almost get cacophony at times, the fine points of the band's musicianship pretty much being lost.  Listen, for example, as Chris Squire tries to play the intricate bass lines of 'Yours is No Disgrace'.  I found myself disappointed as he hurried over the phrasings just to keep up with the rest of the band.  Another problem was Steve Howe's free form guitar solo played during the middle of the same tune.  Quite frankly, it stinks.  His technique is sloppy and downright uninspiring and he appears, at times, to be struggling for ideas but then again, Howe has never been known as a particularly creative improviser, preferring instead, like cohort Chris Squire, to carefully work out and rehearse his solos beforehand.<br /><br />All criticism aside, this concert, to me, represented a peaking for Yes.  Their subsequent work, the many personnel changes, the almost revolving door of band members coming and going, the complacency and boredom that began to set in as the seventies wore on.....These all gradually chipped away at the band's energy and creative hunger and what was known as YES, as it was in 1972, as we see them in concert on this film, soon morphed into something entirely different and unrecognizable.  Too bad.Steve Howe's free form guitar solo played during the middle of the same tune.  Quite frankly, it stinks.

B000O1799U|4.0|DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 and was in the running for a film version long, long before it closed in 1985.  Very loosely based on the lives and career of The Supremes, it told the story of a black girl group whose cross-over from \\"race records\\" to the pop charts fuel the success of an increasingly cut-throat recording mogul--and find the price of fame and fortune in the recording industry too high for their liking.<br />While it borrows a great deal from numerous music personalities and stories of the 1960s and 1970s, DREAMGIRLS is essentially a riff on the career of The Supremes and the group's relationship with Motown founder Berry Gordy.<br /><br />The Supremes were originally created by Florence Ballard, a powerhouse vocalist who worked with Diana Ross and Mary Wilson as back up singers.  Berry sought a group that could cross over into the pop charts and reformulated the line-up, moving the prettier Diana Ross to lead--and ultimately dismissing Ballard from the group entirely, replacing her with Cindy Birdsong.  After the music industry turned its back on Ballard, she declined in alcoholism and poverty and died at age 32.  She is widely regarded as one of the great tragic figures on the long list of American rock and roll casualties.<br /><br />When DREAMGIRLS opened on Broadway in 1981 critics praised its powerhouse performances and its dazzling staging--but were somewhat less favorable toward its script and score, noting that the characters were one-note and with one or two exceptions that the score was neither memorable nor able to capture the sharply crafted pop hooks of the Motown style it tried to mimic.  Even so, the play ran five years, and over the years numerous studios, producers, directors, and stars have took a crack at bringing it to the screen--something that didn't happen until 2006.  And once more critics praised its powerhouse performances and dazzling staging--and were considerably less enthusiastic about its script and score.<br /><br />The great flaw in DREAMGIRLS is that, while it centers on the story of Florence Ballard, neither the stage nor screen version actually has the nerve to play it out: it, the rivalry between Ballard and Ross, and the brutalities of the music business are actually somewhat underplayed in an effort to place every character in a softer light.  As for the music, the score does include the stunning \\"I'm Telling You I'm Not Going,\\" but the original criticism stands: although pleasant enough, the songs are not particularly memorable and they do indeed lack the sharp, slick edges of the Motown sound that inspired them.<br /><br />Like many another period film, the look is not really accurate: instead of accurately depicting the 1960s and 1970s it is that era as seen through a modern filter, the 1960s and 1970s as we tend to recall them rather than as they actually were.  Even so, there is plenty of visual splash; the costumes, the concert stagings, and the overall art design is quite fine, and you never actually question accuracy while it unfolds before.  And then there are the performances.<br /><br />With the exception Jamie Foxx, who seems slightly miscast in the role of music manager and producer Curtis Taylor, DREAMGIRLS is filled with memorable performances.  Although she does not imitate Diana Ross per se, Beyonce Knowles captures Ross' look and sense of style remarkably well;  Danny Glover offers a memorable turn as agent Marty Madison; and overall the supporting cast is quite fine.  But the big noises her are Eddie Murphy as James Early, a role based on several singers of the era but most particularly on James Brown, and Jennifer Hudson as Effy White, the role based on Florence Ballard.<br /><br />Murphy's film career has been very up and down over the years, ranging from the popular 48 HOURS to the diastrous HARLEM NIGHTS, and he is at present best known for such mild comedies as DR. DOOLITTLE and NORBIT.  He typically plays himself--but DREAMGIRLS puts him onthe acting map in a serious way.  Not only does he does he offer an extraordinary bit of work as the flamboyant but self-destructive R&B singer, he tears strips off his musical numbers.  Prior to her appearance in DREAMGIRLS, Jennifer Hudson was best know as an also-ran on television's American Idol, which entirely failed to anticipate the depths of her vocal talents and acting skill.  DREAMGIRLS, however, exploited what television missed--and while it is technically a supporting role, Hudson's Effie White is the glue that holds the whole thing together.  It is easily the most remarkable screen debut since Barbra Striesand's 1968 FUNNY GIRL.<br /><br />DREAMGIRLS is not a \\"perfect\\" film, much less a \\"great\\" musical.  As previously noted, the script is a bit weak and the music slightly below expectations, and when all is said and done it's a bit too glossy for its own good.  But it is easy on the eyes, the cast is solid, and you'll never be less than amazed by Murphy and Hudson.  The one-disk DVD offers extended scenes but little else; if you are a hardcore fan you'll no doubt want to go with the double disk special edition.

B000QQFKYE|4.0|Inland Empire is perhaps the most obtuse movie David Lynch has made since Eraserhead. In many ways it is a triumph of the imagination and admirable for its total disregard of Hollywood convention. However, this is the first Lynch film (and I've seen them all) where my attention began to lag and my fingers were sorely tempted by the fast-forward button. Although this movie contains a plethora of dark and wonderful elements, the whole does not equal the sum of the parts. I think the ultimate problem is the story lacks a compelling central character. About halfway through the movie I ceased to care what happened to Laura Dern, in any of her incarnations. Also, while the movie is laden with the sense of mystery and forboding that is a Lynch trademark, it quickly loses any effect because there is never any payoff. Inland Empire is in many ways a summary of every theme or device Lynch has employed in the past. Until he creates his next masterpiece, it will have to do.
B00005QCVY|3.0|Although it didn't impress much at the time of it's release, this film probably more than most others, goes to show that eventually the cream always rises to the top.  It's just a charming, heart-warming film with a nice mix of comedy, drama, sadness, despair and joy which makes it difficult for any human being to not be touched emotionally in some way by this film.  The screenplay is very good, the casting excellent and James Stewart shows why he is considered to be among the greatest screen actors of all time.<br /><br />The DVD though isn't all that much to shout about.  The Special Features are pretty decent with a very good documentary about the film hosted by Tom Bosley of \\"Happy Days\\" fame being the standout but it's placed on the the \\"B\\" side of this single disc.  Fortunately with the advent of Blu-ray and the much greater capacity such a format affords, we don't have to put up with this inconvenience any longer.  The sound quality is in the original mono format which has been THX mastered which makes it the best possible mono quality that you can find.  However, it would have been nice if they were to provided Dolby or otherwise 5.1 Surround Sound Options as well.  The picture quality has been restored but not very well as visual imperfections exist throughout the film suggesting either a poorly preserved master or that the restoration job wasn't the best.<br /><br />I note at the time of writing that a Blu-Ray version is out there and I wonder if they made any more audio and visual restorations and if so, I will certainly put it on my list of Blu-Ray titles to get in the future.  If you are not too picky about the \\"dirtiness\\" of the picture quality, this DVD is certainly one for your collection that bears the test of repeated viewing and enjoyment.<br /><br />Recommended.
B001437DMA|4.0|Not that close to the masterpiece Super Colossal is, but not so far from it either. This album is quite balanced as all Satriani's work tends to be. It has the ups, it has its downs. I just wish he hadn't been so shy in a couple of songs like \\"Asik Vaysel\\" where he experimented with sounds unusual in his works but he didn't quite got \\"there\\", didn't break into any new landscape of sound he probably was searching for and instead shied away back to his confort zone. I loved \\"Revelation\\" as simple as it is. That's the beauty of Joe, he's a master on both complex and simple, and his songs are both melodic and emotional in any kind of variety. As another reviewer commented, I'm beginning to see this trend for \\"crowd songs\\" now he kinda followed up \\"Crowd Chant\\" from Super Colossal with the new \\"I Just Wanna Rock\\". I don't critizice Joe for the quality of the song, his quirks or any corny reason why he's playing this type of song, but I do feel the track is out of place in this production. I think he should limit these type of songs to DVDs and Live Albums. Overall a very good album which sadly doesn't build up on Super Colossal's breaktroughs and shows Joe \\"playing it safe\\" once again.     I will be enjoying it for a while, nonetheless and I'll hope for a greater \\"revelation\\" of a true \\"musterion\\" of Joe's music in the near future.
B0013D8LOU|2.0|I hate musicals, I figured I'd go ahead and get that little tidbit of information out of the way early, but for some reason I thought that I might actually enjoy Tim Burton's recently released \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" starring Johnny Depp (\\"Sleepy Hollow\\"), Helena Bonham Carter (`Harry Potter' series), and Alan Rickman (`Harry Potter' series). To clarify, in case anyone is curious I don't consider Disney's numerous animated films (which I am generally a fan of) to be musicals even though they contain 4 or 5 musical numbers, so those movies don't count. I do know the reason behind my decision to view this movie; it was because I had heard that this musical was not like most musicals in that it didn't contain choreographed movements in sync with the musical score, big song and dance numbers, and that it actually felt more like a normal movie. So, like an idiot I listened and thought that there was actually a chance that I would enjoy this movie, and I honestly did give it a chance even though I loath these types of films, because I am a fan of Johnny Depp's and Tim Burton's (to an extent), so I thought those two people alone may make this a more tolerable musical than most; however, I was wrong.    \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is the story of a talented barber (Johnny Depp) who is wrongfully imprisoned by a corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who wants to steal his wife away. After spending 15 years locked up, the barber is released and has changed his name to Sweeney Todd, but his name isn't the only thing that has changed over the years. Sweeney is no longer the sweet, charming barber he once was, in his place is a man consumed by darkness and a deep-seeded thirst for vengeance, and his thirst will be quenched and no one will stand in his way.    Let this movie be a lesson to me to never rent a musical again for myself, no matter how interesting it appears to be. Because no matter how hard the moviemaker tries to make the musicalmore mainstream and more like a normal movie, so long as they are staying true to the source material the annoyances will remain intact. I will say that I do respect the various filmmakers who tackle musicals for doing their best to remain as faithful to the source material as possible in a two hour film. If I was a fan of musicals and some hack director tried to adapt one of my favorites and butchered it or changed it too much, then I would be extremely frustrated and angry with Hollywood's need for updating or changing what has worked so well in other mediums to better suit their needs. I only say this because as a comic book fan and video game fan, I hate it when some Hollywood hotshot deems himself worthy of changing and manipulating my favorite characters to what he/she believes they should be, regardless of the source material. So, take note all you directors out there looking to adapt comics, games, books, and any other media into feature films, fans enjoy the movies better when you stay true to the roots of the material you are adapting. Now, I understand that some things need to be changed for the translation on the big screen to be more believable; however, there is a limit to how much can be changed before any semblance of the material is lost and it no longer seems to be an adaptation but instead seems like a re-imagining that can not even hope to hold a candle to the quality of the source material.    What annoys me about musicals, which I alluded to earlier, is the way that musicals always seem to force the characters to choreograph their movements to the beat of the music throughout the scene. When this occurs it becomes so glaringly obvious and forced to me, that it tends to distract me; therefore taking away from the scene and my enjoyment in the movie. Now, thankfully Tim Burton didn't allow this to happen too many times throughout the movie, but in the scenes it did occur in, they tended to be the ones I least enjoyed, not that there were too many that I found all that enjoyable to begin with. Another cause for complaint to me is during some of the big musical numbers some character can just walk in the room and instantly know the song being sung, and just join in as if they'd been there all along. This annoys me even further when it's a song being sung by two characters that have not met prior, yet they each know the song perfectly and can sing in perfect harmony during the choruses. If this was a normal movie and someone came into a scene opposite a character he/she had never met before, and instantly knew what to say and what the other person may say, this would seem forced and poorly written, but in a musical it's just accepted as normal. I just don't get it. Now, I know you may be thinking that Disney's animated films do this annoying kind of thing all the time by having numerous character join in on the big musical numbers and know all of the words to the song even though there should be absolutely no way they could possibly know them, and yet I enjoy those films; but, as I said before I don't view Disney movies as musicals so I give them some leeway. Go ahead, call me a hypocrite, I admit it, when it comes to this kind of thing, I am. My final gripe is why in a musical does it seem like too much to ask for the characters to go more than 3 minutes without singing, just because it's a musical film doesn't mean there has to be almost constant music, a little more of a break between the big, and even somewhat smaller, musical numbers would have been much appreciated and may have let me enjoy the movie a bit more.    From an acting standpoint, the cast did a good job, and for a person who hates musicals they all handled their songs very well, which is surprising given that Johnny Depp has admitted that he had no idea if he could sing or not prior to accepting the role of Sweeney, and he actually had a decent voice. Helena Bonham Carter and Alan Rickman were very good as Ms. Lovett and Judge Turpin respectively, both had very good singing voices and both portrayed the underlying, duplicitous nature of their characters perfectly, though Rickman's was more overt than Helena's had to be. Regarding all the various actors' appearances in the movie, I hate the way Tim Burton always makes his characters somewhat pale and looking as if their eyes are sunken in. This particular look makes Helena (who also happens to be Burton's significant other) look somewhat ugly and unhealthy, not that she's the most glamorous looking woman in Hollywood, but she does look better than he allowed her to look in this film, though I suppose her look did fit the character more than her natural appearance would have. Sacha Baron Cohen was alright in what was essentially a cameo role in the film as a rival barber, he did seem to be a bit over the top and annoying in his scenes, and maybe that was what his character was supposed to be like, but it just irritated me, and I couldn't wait for his departure from the movie. The remainder of the cast was good, though not particularly memorable, and most seemed to be nothing more than fodder for Sweeney to practice on as he prepared for his ultimate goal of killing Judge Turpin.    I will give Tim Burton this, he knows how to make a movie all his own. From the cinematography, to the special effects, the make-up, even to the actors, you can always tell you're watching a Tim Burton film the minute you see a scene or two, because his style is just so distinct that no other director seems remotely capable of copying it. So kudos to him for his innovative sense of style and direction, it's rare for someone in Hollywood to be able to reach the level of success that he has without there being at least some copycats out there trying to do exactly as he does. Aside from Burton's penchant for the semi-goth appearance for most of the characters in his films, I find myself generally enjoying his movies on some level, though they may not always be favorites of mine they are at least worth watching once, but I do believe that for me \\"Sweeney Todd\\" is pushing it. I am surprised that Tim stayed as true to the musical as he could, since he admits during the special features for the movie that he is not a fan of musicals, yet for some reason this one seemed to strike a chord with him. So I at least appreciate that he took great care to stay mostly true to the original material, which I'm sure made many fans and critics happy.    I'm sure by this point, you readers are not at all surprised to learn that I will not watch this movie ever again, and find it hard to recommend it to anyone. However, if you are a fan of musicals you will probably enjoy this film, though be warned it is extremely violent during the latter half of the movie, so if you are somewhat squeamish you may not like it as much. If you are someone like me who doesn't enjoy musicals, but still find yourself curious to see if this one would be different, take it from me, aside from the violence (which was actually when the movie began to feel a bit more like a normal movie to me and become a little more tolerable), this musical is just like all the others, full of all the annoying qualities that one has come to expect from them.    \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is rated R for violence and brief language.

0385512058|5.0|This book presents an insightful guide on how relationships can craft one's life and career. But importantly, it starts with identifying our true goals and passions and extends to cultivating a personal brand for ourselves.    Keith not only tells his story in a direct and easy-to-read style, but shares the specific techniques he has learned and are so much a part of the way he operates. This stems from the fundamental idea that human connectivity is not only unavoidable, but essential in finding self-actualization.    It's easy to cast off a book such as this as superficial. In fact, the title made me shy away until I had the chance to see Keith present a seminar early this year. He does drop names, and he does risk sounding like compete ego-maniac, but seeing him in person was powerful because he truly checked his vanity at the door.  Readers should do the same if they want to get the most value out of this book, both in theory and later in practice.
B000WTZ784|2.0|British rockers Genesis' 20th album, and last studio album, called Calling All Stations was released in September of 1997.<br />The album was the group's first album since longtime singer/songwriter/drummer Phil Collins decided to leave Genesis in 1996 (as stated on the DVD that comes with this re-issue, he had no intention of leaving after the We Can't Dance album and tour but had a life altering experience (one of which moving to Switzerland to be with what turned out to be third wife) which led to his amicable split in March of 1996), guitarist/bass player Mike Rutherford wanted to press on after Phil left whilst keyboard player Tony Banks was initially against the idea. Banks releneted and agreed to go on and recruited a little known Scotland native from the group Stiltskin named Ray Wilson as lead singer. To fill the drummer's shoes and since Wilson wasn't a drummer, both Nir Zidkyahu and Nick D'Virgilio (Spock's Beard) were called in to play drums.<br />When I first heard the album in 1997, I admit, I detested the album and 14 years on, still find it their weakest album with a bunch of songs I absolutely hated.<br />The highlights on the album are the haunting title cut, the single \\"Congo\\" (I prefer the single edit than the album version which its ending isn't fully realized), the exquisite \\"Not About Us\\" and the other epic \\"One Man's Fool\\". These songs are this album's saving grace.<br />The other epics being \\"Alien Afternoon\\", \\"The Dividing Line\\" and \\"There Must Be Some Other Way\\" all drag and sound like unfinished demos.<br />The other tracks on the album (\\"Shipwrecked\\", \\"If That's What You Need\\", \\"Uncertain Weather\\" and \\"Small Talk\\") were all deplorable. In my view, the three B-sides that appear on the Genesis 1983-1998 box set (\\"Anything Now\\", \\"Sign Your Life Away\\" and \\"Run Out of Time\\") and the other leftovers \\"Phret\\", \\"7/8\\", \\"Banjo Man\\" and \\"Papa He Said\\") should have appeared on the album instead and those seven tracks that were excised would have made CAS a much better album.<br />Calling All Stations also became the first Genesis album since 1973's Selling England By the Pound not to crack the US Top 50 peaking at #54 at a time of pop drivel such as Puff Daddy, Hanson and The Spice Girls and fell off the charts immediately. The album failed to go Gold and also the tour was cancelled in the US due to poor ticket sales as many fans refused a Genesis without Phil Collins. We Can't Dance was the last true Genesis album.<br />In late 2007, the album was re-released with a new mix and a DVD which has interviews with all involved on the album (even interviews with Phil Collins explaining why and how he left) and also the album in 5.1 and videos for \\"Congo\\", \\"Shipwrecked\\" and \\"Not About Us\\" plus concert footage from the band's shows in Europe on the 1998 tour.ter album.

B00007KWHP|5.0|I have heard Fragile since around 1977, but it faded back in my playlist since 1990.  'South Side of the Sky' randomly popped up in my iTunes rotation, and I was struck by the composition as if I was hearing it for the first time.  Then I listened to the album again.    This album is amazing.  They were doing things so fresh and adept they haven't been triumphed since.  Fragile is an album that stands alone.  Going for the One, and Relayer, are similar in effort but lack something this album gets; youthful energy.  While energetic, it is wistful, and jazzy, and classical.  I believe by the middle of the 21st century this album will be one of the iconic hallmark sounds of the 'hippie years'.  If the rights were free I suspect it would be the Vivaldi Seasons of rock; played on every luxury class car commercial.    The mood of John Anderson's tenderly plaintive voice, his emphatic, dreamy, poetically vague lyrics set over tones pinned and adorned cunningly by Wakeman's classic keyboard undercurrent.  In between is a mesh of rock instruments surging with natural integrity, not scattered, hardcore ebullience or generic, burned out distortion.  The combination of longer, dramatic pieces mixed with shorter bursts makes this album seem like a buffet of art rather than a dump of aimless stabs at record charting junk food for the ear.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|The Alan Parsons Project released its sixth album in as many years entitled Eye in the Sky in June of 1982.<br />The album was the first new album since late 1980's Turn of a Friendly Card. Whilst that album had its moments (Games People Play and Time) and was a Platinum seller, people wondered if the band was just going to be known for I Robot. In 1981, Alan Parsons (well known engineer and producer who had worked with The Beatles as a tape operator and engineered Pink Floyd's Atom Heart Mother and classic Dark Side of the Moon and produced albums for Pilot, The Hollies and Al Stewart) and collaborator Eric Woolfson began work on Eye in the Sky with mainstay Alan Parsons Project musicians that were bass player David Paton and guitarist Ian Bainson (formerly of the band Pilot known for its 1975 hit \\"Magic\\") and drummer Stuart Elliott (famed for his work on Al Stewart's Year of the Cat and Time Passages albums and on Paul McCartney's 1984 hit \\"No More Lonely Nights\\"). When the album was released, it was right in the middle of New Wave and schlock pop ala Air Supply time. Would this album be a classic or seen as a relic of the past, read on and find out as I did recently.<br />We open the album with the instrumental \\"Sirius\\". What a great opener. I first heard this piece when former WWE (was WWF) wrestler Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat used this music as his entrance theme during his 1986/1987 tenure with WWE (formerly World Wrestling Federation). Since then, \\"Sirius\\" has been used by sports teams such as The Chicago Bulls for its entrance music and sampled by Diddy (a/k/a Puff Daddy a/k/a P Diddy a/ka Sean Combs) on his The Saga Continues album. We then segue into the album's title cut and the Project's biggest hit. The track, sung by Eric Woolfson, got its name from Woolfson hearing that phrase whilst in the US to describe air traffic, surveilance cameras and every other device. Next is \\"Children of the Moon\\" which is sung by ex-Pilot frontman and APP bass player David Paton and it's a great song about the death of culture (which still holds up today). We segue into the short but sweet \\"Gemini\\" sung by Chris Rainbow. The first half closes with the epic \\"Silence and I\\", which was sung by Woolfson. The piece harkens back to some of the classic prog sounds of I Robot. What a great piece.<br />Next is the rocker \\"You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned\\" which was sung by Lenny Zatatek (whose voice was dominant on songs like \\"I Wouldn't Want to Be Like You\\" and \\"Games People Play\\"). What a great rocker. Next is the album's other sing \\"Psychobabble\\" sung by Elmer Gentry. This piece is another winner. Next is the album's second and last intrumental called \\"Mammagamma\\". Whilst it sounds like something that could have been used on the soundtrack to Scarface, the piece had more b*lls and passion than anything that Giorgio moroder could have come up with. Next is another Zatatek sung piece called \\"Step by Step\\" whcih is another great piece. We close the album with possibly my favorite APP track ever, the ballad \\"Old and Wise\\". The track's orchestrations is so powerful that it can actually bring tears to your eyes hearing it. The track is sung by former Zombies frontman Colin Blunstone and this is his best lead vocal EVER done (surpassing anything he recorded pre-1982). The track ends with the most powerful alto saxophone solo ever recorded by famed saxophonist Mel Collins (who has worked with people from King Crimson to Eric Clapton to Roger Waters to Bad Company and The Rolling Stones) and his ending solo playing with the orchestra and band even had brought tears to my eyes as it is the most moving piece I had ever heard (and I hardly ever cry but something about this makes me shed tears of joy).<br />The album became the APP's biggest selling album here in the US and reached the US Top 10.<br />The album was re-released last year and was superbly remastered by Parsons himself with Dave Collins and features SIX bonus tracks including demos for \\"Sirius\\" and \\"Any Other Day\\". Plus the Eric Woolfson guide vocals for \\"Old and Wise\\" and \\"Silence and I\\". Then the rough mix medleys dubbed \\"Naked Eye\\" and \\"Classical Eye\\". These tracks are excellent different looks of each of the album's tracks.<br />Recommended!\\"Any Other Day\\". Plus the Eric Woolfson guide vocals for \\"Old and Wise\\" and \\"Silence and I\\". Then the rough mix medleys dubbed \\"Naked Eye\\" and \\"Classical Eye\\". These tracks are excellent different looks of each of the album's tracks.   Recommended!
B000000IS5|5.0|I genuinly agree with the 5 stars given to all the editions of this MARVELOUS albums (one of my favorite modern jazz albums I've heard so far)...<br />I would just like to add that I agree with those who are of opinion that Miles, although officially the sideman on the Cannonball date, is actually the main star, with the glorious rhythm section contributing at least as much (if not more) than the official leader...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Cannonball is great, but it is the lyrical trumpet of Miles Davis that galvanizes and organizes the group (\\"Autumn Leaves\\"!), and even on the funkier performances of the album Miles is equal to the funky Cannonball, with the Joneses and Blakey working beautifully together....
B0010ZR160|4.0|Although the storyline was a bit unbelievable, this was a good, solid crime thriller.  This is the first time I've seen Casey Affleck and he certainly is a good lead actor.  Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris were at their usual best.  Whether Affleck's character did the right thing haunts us to the end.  Ben Affleck did a great job as a director.    Too much cursing forces me to rate this a 4 - yes I am a prude.
B00005V9IK|5.0|This film about freedom from the destruction and colonization of aliens is more fun than any movie before. Although there's probably no chance that a virus uploaded into an alien mothership would shut down its systems, this movie has plenty of epic explosions and classic science-fiction to make this a grand movie.<br /><br />While the special effects in this movie nowadays looks a little dated, people have admired this movie for director Emmerlich's arrangement of humongous saucer U.F.Os shooting laser beams out of the center of the bottom. No one could forget that frightening explosion of the White House in the movie. And while I have no idea how they opened communications with the president, this film really sets a positive mood.<br /><br />It helps to have a great orchestral score by David Arnold, as well as great actors such as Will Smith, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and Vivica Fox. And boy, Will Smith had fun with this movie. He shows off his bravado literally beating up aliens, firing rockets into spaceships and shouting \\"Peace!\\"<br /><br />Okay, this is a silly movie. However, because \\"Independence Day\\" has so much fun being a destroy-the-aliens movie, it has been one of the best science fiction films in the 90s, more fun than \\"Armageddon\\" or \\"Godzilla\\". Probably the only film that has this much fun is Will Smith's follow up action/comedy film \\"Men in Black.\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout.  Jillian Michaels is a really good trainer.  I did the DVD for the first time yesterday.  When I got up this morning, I was soooo sore! But a good sore.  And that was just on Level 1!  I worked out with the DVD again tonight.  It feels wonderful!  I have already seen my stomach changing shape.  Buy it!
0143038419|1.0|This was a self absorbed self centered woman.  Her subtitle was to find everything.  She ended up with nothing.  When she said her eyes during the divorce were like a refugee, I thought you should have spent the money going to Africa and seen REAL refugee eyes.  And in Indonesia when she got a bladder infection, and called it a TRAGEDY, it was too much.    Better still she should have gone to Africa to help people and she would have ended up with what she searched for which was \\"everything\\".    I certainly will never buy a book by Elizabeth Gilbert!

B00006JLX4|5.0|The real hidden gold here is the live set at Brixton Academy.  Where the studio songs are mostly off-speed, change-up type stuff (for which Pavement made its name) the live songs are a rare glimpse at the fastballs Pavement could throw--high, hard, and unstoppable.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Central Station is an amazing movie!  The two main characters are easy to love and to hate.  If you have good taste in movies you'll love it!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have had a pair of these headphones for about 14 years, and the left ear finally gave out.  I think it was because sometimes I'd wrap the cord around the earpieces too tight.    Anyway, I had been so happy with the sound from these headphones that I searched for the model number on the side of them and was pleased to see that the MDR-W08L are still sold by Sony, so I ordered them right up.  This model has survived the test of time.

B000VPPMXO|5.0|The Virtual Wall Lighthouse is amazing, turning on and off with the Roomba 500 series via RF. I use a network of 5 of these to keep my Roomba out of the bathroom and to let it know which rooms are which.    Definitely get these over the plain old manually-activated virtual walls. You'll forget to turn them off and they eat batteries. Also, the lighthouse works with rechargeable batteries and the manual ones don't.
0684833395|3.0|The book condition was good.  However, we did not receive the book til after a month and a half had already passed.  Good thing we didn't really \\"need\\" the book for something in particular.  Ordered other books on the same day and received within 14 days . . . not sure what happened here but very unhappy with wait time.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|if the writers/producers weren't so obsessed with Ben Browder.  Since his introduction in season 9 he seems to be front and center most of the time while the characters we have known and loved for years get pushed to the side.  Mitchell was once again the central focus of this show while the other characters, most notably Sam, was pushed into a supporting role.    I won't preorder Continuum.  I want to see it first and if it's another Cam Mitchell fest, I'll won't waste my money.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|It was a great movie, it took a while to ship to my ADO address though, but it came in great condition.
0793518326|3.0|I should have considered the comments of other reviewers who said the print was too small - IT IS.  OK, the book is great but not as user friendly as others.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I'm not as eloquent as some of the other posters on here regarding musicianship or R.E.M.'s past albums.  I've always been just a casual fan.  However, Karl Pilkington recommended \\"Accelerate\\" on his podcast in a 4-star RAVE review, so I picked it up.  Pilkington doesn't rave about anything, so when he likes an album, even the songs that don't necessarily \\"tell a story\\", I tend to listen.    It's pretty awesome, it's GREAT for walking around, sitting in the cafe, or on a plane trip to Australia.    Read some of the other reviews for a more detailed interpretation of this amazing CD.  I just wanted to throw that out there for anyone interested, innit.      a'right?
0525457585|5.0|This book is a childhood favorite and even to this day at the age of 21 I absolutely love this book.  The adventure and writing style is absolutely irresistible.
B000001ELL|4.0|Coming off the heels of their solo album project, Kiss returns with an album alittle different in sound than what KISS fans were expecting. The music is more polished and the songs written were more aimed for the top 40 sound. I do like DYANSTY as well as their follow up UNMASKED, but the average Kiss fan may not enjoy this as much if they are looking for an out and out rocker. KISS were back, but the strains of the problems inside the band were showing in their musical direction.    I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU, MAGIC TOUCH AND SURE KNOW SOMETHING are the stand out tracks in my opinion.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|Seems everyone is gushing over this album/EP.  First of all it's short. 35 minutes.  That should tell you something.  Secondly, it's not that good. The heavy rhythm guitar is present like Monster, but the lead is washed away.  If you are trying to get back to your roots, where is the lead guitar?  Songs 5, 6, 7, are the only ones worth talking about.  This release should have been an EP.  Like everyone else says, the lyrics are forgettable.  Just OK
0316067598|5.0|This is a fantastically put together narrative by a real life hero, whom I first became familiar with in Warrior Elite (Dick Couch). This operator tells it like it is without holding back. He gives it to those who deserve criticism, and supports those who deserve all of our thanks. I read this entire book in about two sittings and could not wait to get out and get Dick Couch's follow up book, The Finishing School, in hopes of finding out more about this warrior. I am hopeful that over time more of our nation's best will step up and let those who have never been on the inside know what it is all about.If you have a weak stomach, or spend all of your time in a rant against the administration, though this probably should be the book for you, go re-read something from Al Gore. Leave this one to those of us who salute the flag and truly support our troops.
B000A6T262|5.0|I got this for my husband's birthday and he is really enjoying it! We've really enjoyed watching the second DVD with the special features and have decided to watch the special features first (since we've seen the movies, albeit a while ago) for the last few that we haven't yet viewed.  My husband is very happy that I got the complete set of Star Trek movies, versus the ones with the original cast only.
0743267478|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim from the library 2 days ago and did not put it down till I was done.     The 18-y-o protagonist, Ram Mohammad Thomas, has just won India's \\"Who Will Win A Billion?\\" by answering perfectly 12 questions. However, he is an uneducated impoverished waiter who doesn't know many common knowledge questions, so the judges are sure he has cheated and are beating him at the poice station when Smita, a lady lawyer, comes to hear his side and prove he is legitimate.    It just so happens that each of the questions related somehow to a story in Ram's life, and he relates each one, full of poverty, abuse, child labor, brushes with film stars, diplomats and the clergy, to show how he could know each answer.    Through it all, we meet a clever resourceful boy who never lets down his friends, such as Salim, his fellow orphan who wants to be a movie star, no matter what obstacles he faces. We are sure he is telling the truth about not cheating, but have no way of knowing how he did it until the very end.    I highly recommend this book, and am in fact buying it as a gift for several other people.
0810994739|5.0|When my son was 7, he begged me for the first book.  Read it from cover to cover in a couple of days.  Same with this one.  And, I hear there will be three more that I know I'll be buying.  If it encourages them to read, I all for it.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I enjoyed this series when it first was aired on TV and now I enjoy the DVD as well. I highly recommend the movie in DVD format.
1594489505|5.0|After all these reviews, I would only add a comment and the umpteenth praise for such a fascinating and heartbreaking book (just as it happened after I read `The Kite Runner').   If I had a hypothetical scale to weigh my preference between `The Kite Runner' and `A Thousand Splendid Suns', I do not know which one would earn the winning position, despite their differences.  I guess that's the fate of this second, marvelous book, to be forever compared to the first one by the same author.  When I picked it up, I could not, would not believe that I would like it as much as the first one (it rarely happens with second books, especially if the first ones where such triumphs).  But I did.  Loved them to the same degree, I mean.    Tashakor, Mr. Hosseini.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, if you'll ever read this, for yet another unforgettable tale.  It is not just that, it is the meaning beyond it, delivered to us, your readers, with an awareness made more significant by the deep, evident love for your native, wounded country.  Keep up with the good work!
B000ZN802W|5.0|This was obviously a labor of love, first for Sean Penn...and then his fantastic cast and crew.  The film is tragic and triumphant, joyful and painful.  Emile Hirsch is incredible as Chris McCandless and solidifies himself as an a-list actor with this role.  I rented this first...then I bought it which is rare for me these days. A film you won't easily forget.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Love the songs. Great guitar. Very interesting commentaries by Nikki. Most of us can only imgagine what it was like.
0670018651|5.0|This is actually the second guide to perfume written by Luca Turin. It is updated and contains his assessments of such recent fragrances as Lush's Karma and Paris Hilton's \\"work\\". The essays are excellent, the assessments of the perfumes are spot-on (whether by Sanchez or Turin). It is indeed wonderful to have your memories of the original Arpege stirred up, or to be reminded that we live in a world where Chanel #5 still exists in proper form. I laughed at some of the barbs stuck in a few deserving effluvia, and sighed at Turin's assessment of old favorites which are not so nice any more. The only thing baffling is the star rating which seems to have very little to do with whether the authors liked the perfume; so you can get **** and a bad write up, or ** and a surprisingly merciful one. I don't consider that a big flaw, just a small eccentricity. The writing and points are so well made and this book has zoomed to the top of my charts, and I hope he comes out with an update/addendum sometime in the future where he and Sanchez talk about ones they may have overlooked like Bulgari's The Vert. First class thought, fun, and wisdom.

When my friends stop by they all say the same thing. \\"How about puttin in that Joe Bonnamassa DVD!
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I loved this movie.  It's a very sweet story full of charm, humor, wonderful music and well-meaning people who give due consideration to life's problems and come up with practical, moral and uplifting answers.  So what's my problem?  I'm Irish, so please don't think I'm prejudiced.  It's just that this is a movie I would love to share with my children and other dear family members, but... the language is of the sort I would be washing the kids' mouths out for repeating.  It's just so bloomin' Irish.  If you don't have any tender young ears around, it might be just the thing for you.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Passed the time pleasantly enough, but did not contain more than just any old other episode would have entailed. A disappointment for the price. Perhaps the series spoiled the viewer for straight to DVD releases...hopefully, \\"Continuem\\" might hold something special for the movie price we have to pay.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Ark of Truth wisely departs from the typical formula for the TV series episodes.  Each of the team members undergoes a personal trial without the physical help or support of the other members.  The drama and tension is successfully maintained until the end.  Problem is if you liked the characters before, you may like them even more now!  Naturally, another movie needs to be made....how about finishing off the Wraith in a crossover plot with the remaining SG Atlantis people!
0060273224|5.0|An excellent fiction book that while written for teens and young adults should appeal to any fantasy fans looking for a different kind of heroine. Usually necromancers only appear in novels as the villains, and usually the author doesn't have the heroes fighting in death itself. Garth Nix does as he infuses life into death, color into a grayscape, and depth into what could be a retread storyline (daughter rescues father, meets handsome prince, enters her inheritance, and saves the world). I was IN this world (or more exactly three worlds) while I was reading, so much so I could smell the decay, feel the cold, and hear the bells, completely engrossed and enjoying every minute :-)
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Burton and Depp have done it again with Sweeney Todd.  A downright beautiful, macabre masterpiece in every sense of the word.  However, feel free to call me uncultured when I was surprised that this was a MUSICAL.  I'm glad I didn't know ahead of time because I never would have given it a chance.  The surprise was bloody glorious!  High praise for this film!
B000WCBPOG|4.0|Of course, no one can redo a beatle's song. It's sacrilidge. But this is an nice remake. The cast and crew did a great job and the movie was fantastic.

0446677450|4.0|Warning: This is not a \\"Get Rich Quick\\" type of book. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" teaches you how to think like a millionaire. It's more philosophy than how to...It helps to lay the necessary mental groundwork for making money.<br /><br />Author, Robert T. Kiyosaki believes that in order to make money you need to change your attitude about it. Mr. Kiosaki sounds a lot like Dr. Phil. Like Dr. Phil, Kiyosaki believes that, \\"You can't solve money problems with money.\\" Kiyosaki gives the example of the lottery winner who loses everything in a year or two.<br /><br />Most financial books start off with a bang, and the fizzle out toward the end. This one does a pretty good job of maintaining your interest. It's repetitive where it needs to be and doesn't go overboard.<br /><br />This book is quick to offend the bleeding hearts. \\"Rich Dad\\" is often made to seem superior to the \\"poor dad\\"--who isn't poor in the traditional skin and bones sense, by the way. He's a teacher. Personally, I was not offended. To me if you want to be a doctor learn from a doctor, if you want to be rich learn from a rich guy...Many object to some of Kiyosaki's risky advice, but it really all depends on how you weigh risk. You can invest $5000 in the stock market and learn from your mistakes, but eventually come out ahead, way, way ahead, or you can pay $40,000 to be a teacher and join the rat race. The fact of the matter is no one ever got rich by being a pussy. You can live off your income, but you won't get rich off your income. Sure, there are the lottery winners, but for the most part the rich get that way through investing. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad,\\" will not teach you how to invest, but it will motivate you to find your own path to wealth using Kiyosaki's tools. That being said, I won't be reading any more from the \\"Rich Dad\\" series. I have a strong feeling it just gets worse from here.<br /><br />English majors will probably hate this book. It's a little cheesy. Okay I'm being nice, it's super cheesy. Kiyosaki comes off as a bit of a salesman, one of those guys selling snake oil at 2a on some cable network. It causes for some annoying heavy handed prose that is difficult to swallow at times. He also takes plenty of time to hawk his hundred dollar \\"Cashflow\\" game.<br /><br />Fave Quote: \\"The main reason most people are not rich is because they are terrified of losing.

B000TGJ80I|5.0|The quality is top notch. I was extremely pleased to see that the video quality lived up to the reviews.  I was a little worried about the unrated version just wondering how much footage would be extra and will that enhance or take away from the move. I love this movie so to get more insight into the story by getting to see more footage is very rewarding. There were a couple of parts that I could have done without but this one shows more story and a bit a skin. The former being very interesting to me because I really dig the story and this one definitely provides more insight to the characters themselves. I HIGHLY recommend this disc to anyone that's a fan of Underworld. This movie is why I have a blu ray player.
B000VFGQUC|5.0|Lizzy fans will snap this up quickly!  This was released on VHS a few times in the past, the 1st time around was in mono (!!!) Back then, it did not matter because everyone was using those awful, clunky top-loader VCRs with a remote that had an actual wire attached.  Finally, it's on DVD with 5.1 sound!  This is one the greatest concert films ever, even though it's short.  The classic Lizzy lineup, live, at their peak.....and oh those dualing lead guitars!!  Apparently, other soon-to-be-big bands picked up on this \\"dual lead\\" formula (think Judas Priest here).  This is one rock fans have been waiting for!!  Lizzy, in particular, Philip, had more charisma than most.  Always the poet/songsmith, front man, and focal point...here we hear and see him rock on the bass!  The packaging is WAY above average on this product....nice box, cut horizontally, with booklet, and, a 1975 audio show that even as a collector, I had never heard of.  Definitely worth the price (not to mention all the bonus features like the Sight and Sound show from 1983, wow!) If that wasn't enough, the Top of the Pops gems are crammed on as well.  Live at the Rainbow is just fantastic.  You will proceed to checkout NOW!
B000007ODL|5.0|This is probably one of the very best JJ Cale collections out there. It shows a true diversification of his music and style. I would recommend it to anyone who has or has not ever listened to him. You won't be disappointed.
B00133KHCY|4.0|I finally had a chance to see this movie on blu-ray. As a music lover and believer in the power of music, for healing, catharsis, unity and many other powerful experiences and situations,  I really enjoyed how the child attempted to speak to his \\"lost parents\\" and the parents to each other. The score of the film is itself very powerful and blended seemlessly in the story. The song lyrics sung by Jonathan Rhys Myers fit perfectly into the story, and the mom's face when she saw her son at the concert was priceless. This movie truly warms the heart, and is a great date movie, or an opportunity to remember the things that are important. Highly recommended!

B00005JO5L|3.0|For all the justifications offered by the filmmakers in the docs and commentaries here there's simply no getting over the fact that this is an expression of straight panic and the vilest bigotry. Neither can you escape the fact that it works as an entertainingly lurid thriller, 70s time capsule as well as a cluelessly campy portrait of the world it pretends to expose. (Watch hapless Al try and figure out the proper \\"hankie\\", or throwing out his stack of porn -- one magazine at at a time -- I defy you not to laugh.)<br /><br />However, the homophobia is so intense that Freidkin sacrifices all storytelling logic. He revels in thinking the killer's identity is ambiguous. It isn't, all the killings have to be commited by the crazed I'm-Here-You're Here dude, even if they are played by differnt actors. He fails to realize that larger case he's making is that gay sex is like a virus spreading violence and death. He seems oblivious to the irony that the real thing would be visited on this community soon enough. (Freidkin does mention on the commentary an actor died soon after filming but doesn't say why.)<br /><br />I'm not saying the filmakers are bad people, but they're certainly misguided. It would have been nice if the documentary had included a lookback from some of the surviving aggrieved parties as it certainly seems they had some valid points.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I am a big fan of Wes Anderson. From bottle Rocket through to the Life Aquatic, his movies transport you to a time & place that is distictively his... 'The Darjeeling Ltd' is a feast for the eyes... stunningly rich in colour & texture, with Wes's usual attention to detail. Every scene is like a photograph, beautifully lit & art directed to perfection.   The only draw back in this often brilliant movie, is lack of chemisty between the main characters who play three disfunctional brothers. They are all great actors individually, but fail to be convincing as a threesome. For me, the spark 'The Darjeeling Ltd' needed was Luke Wilson. As good as Adrien Brody is in the movie, Luke would have been better... he would have added that quirky touch & doubled up on the Wilson brothers brand of subtle humor. Despite the lack of Luke, Darjeeling is an entertaining, funny, sad & intelligent film that in my opinion is a must see for any movie lover who likes something other than the usual predictable crowd pleaser!
0739321005|5.0|I have the book on cd, and it is read by the author. This book gives us a very good insight to who Barack Obama is, and what makes this man tic! It is truly a Cinderella story, and shows a man determined, and has the life experience to not only understand the social problems we have in this country today, but shows his abilities to solve them as well. This man has truly pulled himself up by his boot straps, and made a difference, in spite of his obstacles of being bi-raacial. Through his help as a Community Organizer, he knows how to work with both side of the isle to get things done, where both sides are happy, which is almost never heard of in these days of political upheaval. It is a wonderful \\"listen\\" and I would reccommened this book/cd to everyone, who may want to know, just who is the man Barack Obama.
0525950079|5.0|This was a very worthy successor to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  It had the same rich character development which I enjoyed so much in the first book.  The black plague made for good storytelling as well.

B000J103PC|1.0|I presume the book was better.  Here we toss some stereotyped characters into an \\"oooh, bad office\\" situation and let them do...nothing.  Meryl Streep brought her character to life, as always, and delivered a remarkable quantity of dialogue, but so what?  The movie goes nowhere.  Bumpkin, bad boss, fashion models...  Like those models, it never gets past the surface, and it's a boring surface at that.  No character, no plot, no witty dialogue, no humor, no point.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Possibly the most exhaustive collection of information and material on any one film I have EVER seen. Even George Lucas would have to say \\"damn!\\" they seem to have gathered material from EVERYWHERE , the extras are extremely fulfilling. The actual features (the films) are excellent and pristine I have viewed them on a Harmon Kardon up-rez dvd and Playstaion 3 bluray player and they look and sound wonderful    a must for any serious dvd collection
B00132D808|4.0|I feel compelled by all the negative reviews to add my two cents.  I did NOT like A Fever You Can't Sweat Out and so I didn't really pay any attention to this album until I heard the band play \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" on SNL.  I have since been listening to Pretty Odd non-stop and I think it's great.  It's not a scenester record and it's not trying to capitalize on current pop/rock trends like the previous album.  I particularly enjoy the use of real instruments and the total lack of synthesizers, it makes the album a joy to listen to.  It also doesn't sound over compressed like so much mainstream music these days.  Sure it borrows, sometimes heavily, from The Beatles but there's a ton of bands out there who have borrowed from The Beatles while still managing to make their own unique musical statement.    If you're looking for more boring teenager angst and songs that are just loud and fast then you're in the wrong place.  This album is mature and the songs, like A LOT of great songs, take some time to grow on you.  The hooks can be subtle but that makes them all the more rewarding during repeated listening. If you need music that is totally non-challenging and that you like instantly then perhaps your tastes have not evolved enough to appreciate what PATD is trying to do here.  Personally, I hope they use this album to leave all their scenester fans behind and win over new fans like me who just love good music.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|There's an old joke in Hollywood that goes: (Q.)  What are the four most frightening words an actor can ever speak?  (A.)  \\"I want to direct.\\"  When the actor is Robert Di Niro, (certain to be surrounded by adoring Yes-Men), the results can be as frightening as an exploding cigar or poisoned martini.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd is a true \\"cameo-fest,\\" no lesser a light than Joe Pesci gets about 5 lines (although they are memorable.)  Alec Baldwin was probably done his scenes in half a day.  (Di Niro himself provides a listless shuffle-on.)  While Jolie, Turturro, Gambon, Hutton, and Hurt are around a bit longer, none are around long enough to help.<br /><br />Di Niro also shows us his Hollywood juice through funding; the film is beautifully produced, time and place are evoked exceptionally well, clothes, cars, interior design, all done with great care.  Why then is The Good Shepherd longer than a Sunday afternoon double-header between two last place teams?  For starters, the run-time is a shockingly self-indulgent 167 minutes, pushing the 3-hour envelope.  For another, absolutely nothing happens.  It would be tempting to blame this on Matt Damon, (still unconvincing when playing an adult, much less an adult in a position of authority), or on Eric Roth, who wrote the screenplay.  But Damon, as the \\"anti-Bourne,\\" is clearly doing what's he's told, and Roth's screenplay might have been good had it been significantly tightened.<br /><br />As readers of John Le Carre know, the actual work of spies, the tradecraft, is extremely boring.  The fascinating aspect of their world lies in the personalities of these people, their emptiness, their loneliness, their complete inability to trust, their facility with lies until they arrive at the point where they're barely able to believe themselves, and the devastating emotional toll all of this takes.  Carre's work walks you through this inner landscape in a way film never can, because film is a visual medium, and watching a stone faced Matt Damon for the better part of 3 hours tells us nothing - which is rather the point - his ability to reveal nothing serves him well as a spy.<br /><br />Di Niro gets an \\"A\\" for hubris, he strong-armed a lot of \\"names\\" onto the set.  And he gets an \\"A\\" for ambition, it's a complex story of inner turmoil, difficult moral choices, layers of deception, and the clash between idealism and pragmatism.  But he gets an \\"F\\" for implementation and direction, averaging out to a \\"C.\\"  Where The Spy Who Came In From The Cold succeeded because of its laser-sharp focus; bloated scope and lack of character insight cause The Good Shepherd to resemble the Bay of Pigs.the better part of 3 hours tells us nothing - which is rather the point - his ability to reveal nothing serves him well as a spy.

B000N6TYLW|3.0|I think the series basically ran out of gas.  Don't get me wrong I have thoroughly enjoyed the Gilmore Girls over the past few years but Season 7 just seemed to drag on and on and the story arc could have been wrapped up in half the time.  Having said that, if you enjoy the Gilmore Girls then you still need to watch how it all ends.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|Stargate SG1 is simply a fabulous Sci-Fi show and its great that the team is able to produce some movies following the cancellation of the show after Season 10.  If you love the show, you'll love the movie.  I think Ben Browder finally has a handle on his character Cam Mitchell which was great to see.  I think the music was over the top and interfered in some of the scenes.  You could almost hear echoes of other movie themes within the musical score for the DVD movie - don't know if that was deliberate or simply unoriginal.
B00005MP58|4.0|I love this adaptation of my favorite book, and watch it about once a year.  I also read the book that often.  The series is very much like the book in all respects -- except the one famous improvement in the \\"A Chance Encounter\\" scene.  The only problem is that I was hoping this edition would have subtitles for the hearing impaird.  I know one recording of this series does indeed have that option, but was disappointed that this \\"special edition\\" did not.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I'm signed in as my husband, so no this isn't a man writing this. I am almost 6 months pregnant and just got this DVD. What a great workout! I haven't been a very good exerciser during my pregnancy and got this hoping to get motivated again. I really enjoyed Erin \\"realness\\" (she stopped mid exercise and announced she had to pee) and the variety of the workout. I love that she combines typical aerobics class fare with ballet, pilates, yoga, etc. It was challenging but fun. And yes I am sore after all those squats! But I'd say this is definitely a worthwhile buy for anyone wanting to stay active during pregnancy.
B000065BPB|5.0|These heaphone have incredible sound. Kickin bass, solid mids, clear highs; even music from a cheap boom box sounds great. These are not the most comfortable headphones I've ever owned. My Sennheiser EH2200 phones from a few years back were more comfy.    But the sound of the HD 280 pro make me forget about comfort once I start listening.    Having replacable parts is a plus.     After this pair I doubt if i will ever switch brands, I will just upgrade.

B00003CX5P|3.0|I saw this movies in theatres, and at the time I remmeber really enjoying the movie. The special effects were amazing, the lightsaber battles were awesome and Darth Maul was the badest Sith I had ever seen, so very different in his approach than Vader.    I recently bought this DVD, because I only had this movie on VHS and I no longer own a VHS Cassette player. I had all the other movies on DVD so I figured I would complete my set. I put it in and watched it again, and I found myself getting a bit bored. The storyline was only \\"OK\\" and in many cases the acting was seriously bad. Having a very young Anakin Skywalker was a poor choice I feel. The viewing audience would have happily accepted a 12-14 year old Anakin, and maybe, just maybe, they could have found an actor who didn't so precociously force his lines.    When watching the Original Trilogy, you know that the heroes of that series would most likely die if put into the situations they endure, but each character has a \\"hero factor\\" a kinf of charisma that lets you suspend disbelief enough to convice yourself that they could pull off the impossible saves that they do in the film.    You don't get that same feeling from the characters in this movie. Anakin should have died at least 8 times in situations that is rediculous to expect an 8 year old to handle. Also all the characters seem \\"invincible\\" until its time for them to die to promote a plot point. When Vader died it was like \\"wow, you can feel the pain he has been through and he relief at redemtion\\" when the Emperor died is was climactic. Qui Gon had an air of calm command about him, but when he died it didn't seem like a tragedy, it seemed more like \\"Oh well, I guess its time I died.\\" You can only take the Jedi stoicism so far before it seems cheesy. Obi Wan was does not yet have the commanding presence he later will, but we can accept that because of his relative \\"youth\\" in the movie. The only character that gave the same kind of awe Yoda originally did, was Mace Windu, and he was only breifly in this movie.    And then we get to Jar Jar and Padme. Jar Jar was just incredibly annoying, and he served no purpose in the movie. In fact the movie would have been improved and would have flowed much better had the whole Gungan species not been present in it. \\"Oh lets escape from these droids by going to an underwater cuty for 5 minutes.\\" and then \\"Oh lets rescue the princess by traveling through the planet's water filled core (which doesn't makes sense according to 'Physics').\\" I know the Gungans were only in the movie for Comic Relief, but unfortunately (and this is true for all incidental Aliens in the new trilogy) they just made the movie seem cartoonish. Whereas the aliens in the original trilogy seemed a bit sinister and unknown, I strongly feel that I have seen the aliens from the new trilogy before.. on Cartoon Network.    While I can watch the Original Trilogy and it still seems as fresh today as it did when I was a little kid, watching the new trilogy after a few years just reminds me of how dated they feel, and how poor the new trilogy it compared to the Original. Yes the special effects are better, Yes the lightsaber battles are amazing, but they lack the moral core that the original trilogy had and the motivations for the way the characters act all seem contrived.    While I would suggest anyone who is a StarWars fan keep a copy of this movie, and it is certainly cheap enough, it really doesn't live up to its own legacy.

If you ask me, Xilinx's marketing or technical support department should have written this book. If you want to get involved with fpga development, then buy this book and the development board. I'm recommending this book to several other software engineers as well as some of my students. Well done Prof Chu!

B000SNUMC0|4.0|I've been a IE fan for 10 years now and just like many was very dissapointed when Barlow left the band. I told myself I wouldnt listen to the new stuff with Ripper. Well one day I decided to give Glorious Burden a listen and was blown away. So I was really looking foward to this Cd when it came out. I got to say, not bad. It's not as good as GB but does have it's high points. There's a lot of shorts here and there and as many others have stated this Cd was designed to be listened straight through to understand the story. The songs that stand out for me are:     Charge to Keep  Order of the Rose  The Clouding  Domino Decree  and of course Ten Thousand Strong.    That being said it's not their best offering, but definately not their worst. The upcoming Cd and the Return of Matt Barlow should be interesting. I for one can not wait!
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I had never heard of this musical before the movie was advertised.  I wasn't familiar with the score, so I didn't miss any of the songs they cut.  I knew the basic story from commercials, but I had no expectations going into this film.  I like Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter and that was my main motivation for seeing it.<br /><br />I was delighted at how well Depp can sing. He imbued his songs with real emotion and his voice is surprisingly rich. This was especially true during the ode to his razors, \\"My Friends.\\" The look on his face as he cherishes them is scary as hell, and brought the character fully to life for me.  This was my favorite song of the movie.  Depp was also careful to enunciate clearly, so I had no problems understanding what he was singing most of the time.  Unfortunately, the same is not true for Carter.  Other reviewers have complained about how weak her voice was.  I didn't notice that so much; her voice was okay, and I thought she played the part well.  However, most of the time I couldn't tell what she was singing outside of the chorus.  Since the songs convey a lot of the plot/storyline, this was a real problem.  Luckily, she had a number of duets with Depp, and I could follow what he was singing and get the gist. Alan Rickman turned in a lovely performance as the sleazy \\"villain\\" Turpin, and his song with Depp, \\"Pretty Women,\\" was well done.  However, his role was necessarily small due to time constraints (I think) and I wish it could have been more.  The boy who played Toby had an excellent voice, and his role added some lighter moments to a dark story.  As to the lovebirds - they were unremarkable.  They sang their songs fine, but I didn't really get much out of their characters.  They were just there.  I'm not sure if their characters had songs that were cut that would have fleshed them out more, but as it was I didn't care about them in the least.<br /><br />The story itself seemed a bit disjointed at times and this may be due to the missing songs.  At a couple of points, I felt like it was just a series of songs strung together.  No doubt this would be phenomenal on stage, and I would love to see Johnny Depp reprise the role live.  He truly carried the film by the force of his character's charisma.  At all times he was the focus that kept the story flowing.  I can honestly say this was one of his best performances and I truly enjoyed the film because of it.  The costumes, make-up and sets were all great.  Burton gave the film an ethereal feel.  London didn't look real, per se, it looked like I could be seeing this live on stage.  The dirty streets and dark lighting captured the time period and gloomy atmosphere perfectly.  And the R rating is more than deserved.  This is not for children, or the squeamish.  The gore was in your face - literally.  Once Sweeney started murdering, the blood spatter practically hit the camera every time he slit a throat.  And the music carries it out.  \\"A Little Priest,\\" when Lovett and Todd decide to bake up the bodies, is simultaneously macabre and funny as they debate who would make a tasty pie (the priest is too fat, the poet might be diseased...)<br /><br />As to this single disc edition, I was disappointed.  There is only one extra on it.  After watching the film, I realized that additional features would have made the experience better with insights into the adaptation, and possibly deleted scenes.  I really regret not buying the two-disc special edition.<br /><br />Overall, Johnny Depp carried this movie almost completely.  Any shortcomings it has are likely due to adapting a long musical to film. It is very well done, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I decided to give this version to my niece and buy the two-disc set.  It was definitely worth it!  The featurette on the \\"real\\" Sweeney Todd, and the legend was interesting and provided great background.  However, I also highly recommend buying the DVD of the stage show, [[ASIN:B0013Z7RUC Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Keepcase)]], with Angela Lansbury - it was phenomenal.reet (Broadway) (Keepcase)]], with Angela Lansbury - it was phenomenal.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I was intrigued when I learned that there is going to be a Terminator TV Series so I watched it.  One of the biggest reasons I watched it is because of Summer Glau (from Firefly/Serenity).  I love seeing her in action, I just can't get enough of it.    I love the series to continue but I'm worried about it being cancelled, not just because it's under Fox, but it's also going to be aired along side \\"Heroes\\"... which is a popular show (I'm a fan of that too).  But if I were to choose which one to watch, I'll stick with Sarah Connor Chronicles.

B000E33VWW|5.0|In an echo of Faust, celebrated writer Truman Capote was driven by hubris to abandon his conscience in pursuit of his greatest work, the nonfiction crime novel \\"In Cold Blood.\\" With tense dialogue and compelling performances, the film portrays Capote's inner conflict between compassion for his subjects and intense literary ambition, which ultimately paved the way for the author's psychological unraveling.<br /><br />In 1959, Capote and his lifelong friend, \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" author Nelle Harper Lee, travel to Kansas to write about the murder of the wealthy Clutter family. As the story blossoms into a novel, Capote develops a friendship with one of the killers, the troubled Perry Smith. During his interviews with Smith, Capote genuinely empathizes and identifies with the young man, who endured a similarly lonely, traumatic childhood. Despite this sympathy, Capote wants Smith to receive the death penalty in order to provide an ending for the novel. Smith comes to see Capote as a friend and his only hope, a deception that Capote weaves in order to get him to talk.<br /><br />Phillip Seymour Hoffman gives a truly brilliant performance, expertly capturing Capote's distinctive voice and mannerisms as well as the nuances of the writer's inner turmoil. Catherine Keener fits well the role of Harper Lee, whose friendship with Capote provides a voice of conscience and creates some of the film's humorous moments (after a porter raves about Capote's work, Lee turns to him and says knowingly, \\"You paid him to say that.\\" Capote is incredulous: \\"How did you know?!\\").<br /><br />Like that of Faust, Capote's vanity proves to be his undoing. He never wrote another novel and descended into alcoholism, haunted by the remorse reflected in the epitaph of his final, unfinished work: \\"More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones.\\"

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched this series when it was on TV and now I regret that. This is probably the best SciFi out there ... bar none. I love Star Trek and Star Wars (been a Trekie since I was a pup)but this show offers something completely different. It almost makes you feel like you are watching home movies. The stories and acting make you feel as if you are watching a family going through their business. I am told we owe that to Joss Whedon who took his time to hand pick a great crew. I have limited myself to watching the TV series/movie to just once a year because I simply get too depressed knowing that I will never be able to see any more of this FANTASTIC show. Do yourself a favor; find a friend who has the DVS's and watch the first episode. You will be back here on Amazon buying the whole series plus the movie. I wish I could rate this more than just 5 stars.

My excitement for it ended in the first chapter she stated the worst thing in life would be if one of her children were to come home and say they were a republican!  I wasn't looking for a politcal book - I was wanting to read a warm, funny, touching story. I found it to be written without morals and if this is the opinions of most single women today - we are in a world of hurt. I didn't finish it.  It was revolting.

B0013FXWVU|4.0|The classic Seuss tale makes it to the big screen and I was very happy with the results.  I usually find that children's books made into movies can be unnecessarily long and drawn out to make a decent movie time; therefore they tend to drag a bit for this big kid at the theater.  I thought this one was great, a perfect length and it held the interest of my two year old niece who made her debut at the theater that day.  When the movie was over she excitedly asked \\"are we going to watch it again?\\"<br /><br />This movie has all the quirky scenery that you expect from Dr. Seuss; from the funky trees and crazy houses, to the wonderfully imaginative Who's, nothing disappointed.  I was a little afraid to see this as Jim Carey usually grates on every nerve I have with his overacting and hyperactive persona, but he made a delightful Horton and I found myself enjoying him for the first time in years.<br /><br />I recognized a lot of the voices and thought them extremely well cast; Carol Burnett as a villain was a surprise and a treat.  My sister and I laughed out loud a lot throughout this film, we enjoyed it as much if not more than our kids.  The lessons in Horton Hears a Who are simple and one can't help but think how the world would be a better place if everyone had a little more Horton in them.  I really found the whole movie fun and this is definitely a movie I will purchase when it makes it to DVD.<br /><br />Cherise Everhard, April 2008
B00127RAJY|5.0|I say easy because for those of us that have worked out before, the basic jumping jack and jumping rope we think is \\"no problem\\". \\"A cake walk\\". Well not so easy in this video. In fact, when I started the first two minutes of Level one, I was thinking, I will probably be able to do Level 1 twice, so I'll get a good 40 minute workout. YEAH RIGHT!!!!! This workout is amazing. I love that the moves are so easy and basic, that you don't even have to think. Your heart rate starts pumping with the warm up and you are off. There is no stopping, there is no water, there is no talking and right when you want to stop, Jillian says something that seems to be just the right thing that keeps you going. On the second set of Cardio, let me just tell you, I thought I was going to die. On an elliptical or treadmill, you can lower the buttons or drink some water. Not with this video, its' too quick and before you have time to think about how much it hurts or how tired you are, you have moved on to the next move.   Day 3 and my shoulders hurt, my chest hurts, my legs hurt and I feel like I have worked out for 2 weeks straight.  The greatest thing is I could never get up or find time to work out and 20 minutes is nothing. The warm up is quick, the cool down is quick, yet effective and you can feel every move.  If anyone says this isn't long enough and think they can do more, well than I challenge them to do any one of these Levels twice or heck do level 1 , 2 and 3 for a 60 minute work out. HAHAHAHA. I doubt it. I couldn't do level one with no weight just starting out.  If you want to feel soreness and you have had videos in the past and you want strength, cardio and abs....THIS IS THE VIDEO to get. The moves are the old school moves that are not hard and anyone can do them. Lunges, squats, jumping jacks, jump rope. IT's AWESOME! I can't wait to get home to do it tonight. I wish I could do it more than once, but once I get to the 18th minute, I feel like I am gona fall on the floor. IGuess that means my body is changing at that point.  AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!!!!!!
055358202X|2.0|Martin has fallen into the worst tendency of fantasy writers--writing too many words about characters and events that are not interesting to read about in the first place. This book deals with minor characters that keep getting introduced, and worse, nothing actually happens throughout the book. Most chapters can be taken out/skipped without losing anything. I myself got bored and stopped reading half way through the book. I definitely will not be getting the next book either because it looks like Martin has come to value quantity over quality.
1400049628|5.0|I loved this book from the moment I saw the cover.  I read it cover to cover and laughed the entire time.  This past weekend I had a chance to see Max Brooks speak on surviving a Zombie outbreak, and I was expecting nothing but the best.  I was not disappointed.  I highly reccommend this book to anyone who likes a zombie movie, or has a sense of humor.  If the people in all the zombie movies had this book, they would have had NO problems!
B00006JDVV|4.0|Not cheap or a so called B movie as some reviewers have claimed. In fact the film totes some of the most realistic of all CGI creature special effects. It is a bit of a testosterone fueled post apocalyptic dragon slaying film. Matthew McConaughey really shines here in his wild character portrayal. It is an entertaining film overall, and a well done and creative peice of science-fiction. In terms of dragon movies, Its in my top 3 being 1981's Dragonslayer, 1996's Dragonheart and 2002's Reign Of Fire. Good dragon movies are not easy to make and many are plagued with a fake looking dragons. Reign Of Fire is pretty good quality.
0307394549|5.0|I have tried 3 recipes so far and they are wonderful.  By no means are any of the recipes are healthy.  Lots of butter and sugar.  Some recipes you have to shop for the ingredients some require ingredients you would not normally have on hand.   The book does not provide any nutritional information, so if you are looking for reduced calorie or fat recipes you will not find that info in the book.  I bought 3 copies one for myself, one for my sister, and one for my secret sister.  They pictures are wonderfull and the organization is pretty handy.
006117758X|5.0|So asks (p. 245) Bukowski's alter ego, Henry Chinaski, as this gripping romansbildung draws to a conclusion.  The rather mysteriously-titled Ham on Rye is undoubtedly Bukowski's finest and most obviously autobiographical novel.  In it, he gives us a variably chilling, pathetic, hilarious, and defiant portrait of Chinaski's first 20 years, taking us right up to the attack on Pearl Harbor and Chinaski on his way to the Skid Row existence brutally chronicled in Factotum, the second volume in the Chinaski series.<br /><br />There's something heart-wrenching in Bukowski's description of the early years of his anti-hero Chinaski.  A loser father who vents his self-hatred by sadistically beating his son; a spineless mother who can't stand up for either herself or her son--and whom Chinaski loves as little as he does his father; a sometimes comic assortment of misfit schoolmates who attach themselves to a reluctant Chinaski; boring, unrewarding, and mind-killing classes in primary, middle, and high schools; the wondrous discovery of books in the public library; the horrors of out-of-control acne, so like leprosy in both appearance and social consequences; the initial vagueries and eventually fires of pubescent longing; the (d)evolution of an abused and lonely boy into a hard-drinking, hot-tempered, bullying youth; and the beginning of a series of one dead-end job after another:  these are the moments in Henry Chinaski's life captured in the novel.  It's little wonder that by the story's midpoint, Chinaski is a young cynic, disgusted with the \\"proper\\" socially successful world to which his parents aspire.  As he tells us (p. 174),<br /><br />'The problem was you had to keep choosing between one evil or another, and no matter what you chose, they sliced a little bit more off you, until there was nothing left.  At the age of 25 most people were finished.  A whole god-damned nation of a--holes driving automobiles, eating, having babies, doing everything in the worst way possible, like voting for the presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.'<br /><br />Bukowski's brilliant, disturbing novel is a chronicle of hope defeated and tenderness abused.  By novel's end, Henry Chinaski has turned from a lovable, mistreated child into a genuinely unlikeable lost soul.  To a certain extent, in later novels and in real life, both Chinaski and Bukowski will save themselves through art.  But the climb up from the hellish youth and adolescence chronicled here will be long and difficult.or the presidential candidate who reminded them most of themselves.'

0756404746|3.0|It's not that it was a poor book... it just wasn't great.  Certainly not up to par with my big three: Vinge, Martin, and King*.    Honestly, (and I just finished the book) I never once thought of HP.  The fact that our Hero is perfect doesn't bother me -- I don't want to read about a farmer coming of age.  He's a hero... that is why there is a story about him.  I liked the jumping back and forth from present to past; from Kote's story to Kvothe's .    But I have to tell you, I was bothered by the fact that there were parts to the story that simply weren't needed.  The whole \\"dragon\\" escapade (honestly, the bartering for the horse was the best part of that.)  Most of the \\"orphan on the streets\\" portion.  Ambrose.    And the parts that I loved -- childhood with the Edema Ruh, almost anything having to do with the lute, the inspired bad guys (the Chandrian,) Elodin and Auri -- were too short or glossed over or ignored.    I do want to mention that when the innfolk were telling about their favorite Kvothe story, I enjoyed seeing the kernel of truth underneath the myth.    I guess I should mention that there were things that I neither like or dislike... Denna (Devi is a better match) and Sympathy (I am seldom bothered by the magic systems.)    In summary, the book is equal parts brilliant and boring.  I'll buy and read the next one.  But I am not \\"jonesing\\" for it like I am for Martin's next book, I won't reread it over and over like I have Vinge's, and I doubt that 20 years from now I will still remember it vividly like I do King's.    *  A Deepness in the Sky, Vernor Vinge  A Song of Ice and Fire, George RR Martin  It, Stephen King
B0001XAS2G|5.0|This album is Al Stewart at his best.  I first purchased this on vinyl when it first came out.  I have loved this ever since, putting it aside for a while then \\"rediscovering\\" it.  This album marks the end of the collaboration between Al Stewart and Allan Parsons, and they seemed to have saved the best for last.    Time Passages is the follow up album to the hugely successful Year of the Cat, and while it may not have had the imact of its predecessor, it still is well worth a listen to.  Each song is crafted as if it could be released as the main single from the album.  Each musician is in sync with the others, and the orchestrations compliment every song where they are utilized.  It's not surprising that the title song still receives air play 30 years after it was released.    Unfortunately things went sour for Al after this effort.  Perhaps he lost his touch, or the partnership with Allan Parsons could not be duplicated.  In any event this album marks a distinctive turning point in Al's career.  Luckily he was able to build a fan base with this and other earlier efforts and this has what's cemented Al into modern music history.
0307346617|5.0|This book rocked my world! So much so that I immediately put it on my list of favorite books ever and recommended it to nearly everyone I know.  I assumed I would like it because it has zombies in it (I'm a horror buff) and is an example of dystopian/post-apocalyptic fiction, which is a genre that I adore. But I was blown away by how much my expectations were exceeded.    Basically Max Brooks (son of Mel) poses the question \\"what would happen if a zombie plague nearly destroyed the world?\\" and answers it with a stunningly detailed, creative, surprisingly realistic vision. He takes the innovative approach of narrating through a series of short interview excerpts (hence the \\"oral history\\" of the subtitle) and thus we get dozens of small stories that add up to the one global picture. We hear from military men, doctors, scholars, politicians, pilots, even ordinary joes. Brooks leaves no stone unturned. He tackles everything from the various pyschological reactions to the crisis, socio-economic commentary, political consequences, environmental disasters. He also includes some memorable characters and awesome cinematic actions scenes including a female pilot paraschuting into zombie infested territory, a Japanese hacker that suddenly clues into the fact that something is very wrong in his apartment building, an ordinary soccer mom who rips the head off a zombie attacking her daughter, and a Chinese submarine crew that witnesses hundreds of zombies crawling across the ocean floor and trying to claw their way into the submerged vessel. I can't say enough how awesome this book is--please read it.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|This is another fabulous concert from Andrea Bocelli.  The DVD is wonderful too.  I actually play the CD constantly in my car and at home.  His generosity in inviting other talented artists to be in concert with him adds another dimension of enjoyment.  You will love this!

0452289963|1.0|This is an interesting book to review because I can tune in and see what is happening to people who read it and get a close up look at the author using his philosophy to answer questions. While I applaud Oprah for this novel approach to bettering the human race, I take issue with both this author and his book.<br /><br />I read Tolle's first book and found it to be a boring rehash of Buddhism. Because Oprah was so high on his second I figured I'd give him another try and join the book club. I thought it would be interesting to see a book \\"in action\\" and discuss it with others. I even sent a copy to my sister who could use a bit of computer recreation since she now lives in a very small town. This book is better than the first in that it is a better compilation of Buddhist thought. However, it rambles constantly, draws conclusions from encounters that are not necessarily justified and the attitude of its author (who sees himself as enlightened and continuously \\"conscious\\" and egoless), is laughable. Tolle's vanity is nothing short of astounding. Buddhism isn't a pill, it is a practice and awakening has many layers. In spite of this, Tolle has tons of people saying that they have awakened. On one hand  adherents claim to be valiantly battling their ego's while on the other they flaunt their \\"awakening\\",  telling others who claim to be in serious pain to simply read page such and such or tell their \\"pain body,\\" to effectively shut up and go away. Yikes!!!<br /><br /> While it is true that you can't blame the messenger for what people do with the message (Jesus protect me from your followers!) Tolle adopts a similar attitude toward others on the streaming video. His dead pan delivery of jargon in response to questions does not impress me as enlightened or egoless. It might behoove him to remember that those Zen stories he includes in the book were once used by master to deliver highly specific teachings that met the needs of particular students.  He has turned awakening into a race....to what I am not sure, but I do know that enlightenment is not a competitive event. A few months from now there are going to be a lot of people with one hell of a philosophical hangover caused by all those subconscious drives they never bothered to examine and thought they'd left in a dumpster somewhere.<br /><br />I keep waiting for the day when someone writes a version of Buddhism for the working mom. I think that person should herself be a mother with at least one ADHD child. She should be clinically depressed and have a couch potato for a husband. If she manages to help the child grow into someone with a good marriage and a real profession, I'll buy all of her books. Unfortunately what we keep getting are philosophies created by self-satisfied, introverted, childless, hermits like Tolle. There is nothing wrong with an introverted, childless, hermit being self-satisfied. What is wrong is suggesting that his way of being represents THE path to enlightenment for everyone.  I would say that all he has found in Buddhism is a treatment for his (self acknowledged) form of depression and suicidal thoughts. I am glad he is well and happy and wish him the best....but I won't buy anymore of his books because they are just Buddhism repackaged and linked to an attitude I am not fond of.into a race....to what I am not sure, but I do know that enlightenment is not a competitive event.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|I feel that this miniseris has made history much more attainable to the regular person.  I was actually  looking up Alexander Hamilton on Wikipedia last night.  What other show could make me more interested in my country's history?   I mean, I had never wondered before why someone who wasn't president graces our $10 bill before, had you?  I highly recommend this series.  What an awesome lawyer John Adams was.  The court scene where he got the British soldiers off against all odds was amazing.  A+
B000GG4Y32|3.0|This movie features some fine acting, particularly by Jack Nicholson and Paul Sorvino. It very realistically portrays an important era in history that isn't usually tackled by Hollywood, and vivifies a set of significant but repellent people- mainly morally degenerate upper class WASPS and lower class Jews- who tried to overthrow our government but merely managed to corrupt our culture. It's beautifully filmed, but nothing really happens. Its protagonist, John Reed, writes some newspaper articles and a short book, gives some speeches, sleeps around, does some traveling, agitates for Communism, dies and is posthumously used as a propaganda tool by the Soviet Union. There's no personal development, no awareness about the evil system he served- merely some minor stylistic differences with one of its functionaries. Since there's no epiphany involved, all this movie amounts to is a documentary at best and Communist propaganda at worst. Another criticism is that Diane Keaton is the most annoying woman to ever appear on film. How the 1970s ever considered her to be some sort of feminine ideal is beyond me.
0452289963|1.0|There is a lot of talking in this book but not much being said. It kind of reminds me of the story The Emperor's New Clothes- if you are ready to be awakened....Well, if you aren't ready to be awakened you won't be able to see the Emperor's new clothes. No one wants to be unready to be awakened, right? So people read this book and claim to find great wisdom here. Let me play the part of the \\"child\\"  in the Emperor story and proclaim in the street that this man uses a lot of words to say nothing much.
B00104QSOM|3.0|This is an elegant, beautifully-filmed, brilliantly-scored and intensely acted cinematic experience... ...that left me completely nonplussed and apathetic by the time it finished.     Daniel Day-Lewis is really the only actor in this who's either A: on-screen for enough of the movie to make an impact, and/or B: talented enough to make a great performance out of a straightforward set of dialogue. It's not that his supporting cast isn't very, very good - it is - but this film, intentionally or no, ends up as a huge Star Vehicle for Day-Lewis' finely honed thesp skills, and he is excellent as a kind of Charles Foster Kane-meets-J.R. Ewing. Actually, the megalomaniacal leanings of Daniel Plainview are so total and so well-crafted that it's astonishing that we might feel any sympathy for him at all: but thanks to Day-Lewis' skill in the role, he doesn't wind up as a boring bad guy.    For which the audience should be very, very grateful: Daniel Plainview is in probably 90% of this film's frames. Although sometimes this does get a little... ...well, more on that later.    The direction is superlative and the cinematography, exquisite: Paul Thomas Anderson and director of photography Robert Elswitt have done a wonderful job of visualising the maddening disquiet of Plainview's greed against a barren, unforgiving environment.     And the music and sound direction are wonderful, too - this movie uses silence as a sound to great effect for the first thirty minutes or so, and the discord created between lush orchestral movements and harsh, hard-to-hear air raid sirens further the audience's connection with the unusual, unpleasant actions and circumstances of the Plainview family.    So why only three stars? For me, \\"There Will Be Blood\\" was like eating an entire table full of chocolate cakes in one sitting: sure, they're gorgeous and appealing and made to tempt the consumer - but a whole table full is just too rich and you wind up sick and bored. The relentless intensity of \\"There Will Be Blood\\" doesn't allow the audience to catch its breath at all, and while the acting and production are all excellent, the monotony of the film's intense tone doesn't let us assimilate what we've seen. We're constantly assaulted with more Very Serious Acting, more Very Meaningful Imagery, more Terribly Important Cinema - and \\"There Will Be Blood\\", at a hefty running time of 158 minutes, asks too much of its audience in trying to stay engaged with all this high-octane one-note relentless Cinematic Wonderfulness.     That said, it's still a powerful, brilliant bit of cinema: I just didn't care to see more of it after the one hundred minute mark. Somehow, for me, it's less than the sum of its parts - even if its parts are incredible.
B0010X73ZG|3.0|I had read the original short story a long time ago and the concept of a group of people trapped in a grocery store while the world is ending around them with hideous creatures lurking is what had me excited to see the visual interpretation.  That said, while watching this DVD, I lost count of the number of times I uttered the words \\"that wouldn't happen\\".  I realize this is a fantasy/horror movie and, as such, one has to expect the requisite 'don't go down in the basement\\" moments....however, there were so many instances where the characters reactions were entirely illogical and just made no sense.    As an example, the bitter neighbor who refused to acknowledge anything \\"strange\\" was going in despite the confirmation of multiple people and the existence of physical evidence.  I understand his feud with the main character, however, to be completey blinded in the face of such extrodinary confirmations simply defies all logic and basic human nature....this was the first thing that lost me.    Secondly, the neo-nazi christian woman who, from what we know, is the town nutcase....suddenly develops a zealous following which eventually leads to insane, sacrificial acts of violence.  It's understandable that fear would prompt some to think in biblical terms and draw conclusions they would otherwise reject but, the idea that such an extreme reaction would manifest so quickly is ridiculous, at best....completely over-the-top and not believable.    ...and, lastly, the three characters from the Military.....this was probably the biggest illogical aspect of the movie.  These three characters are virtually non-existent throughout the entire ordeal yet, on the way to the store, the main character, his son and the neighbor see hundreds of military personel rushing up the mountain and even comment on this....then, we hear that there is a mysterious base with all sorts of rumors connected to it about secret government experiments.  OK, so....we are then asked to believe that noone in the store would put two and two together and even question these characters....and, as military officers, they would not participate in any of the self preservation activities going on around them...C'MON....they would be leading any efforts and people would naturally turn to them for some guidance.    I did like alot about the movie even with the lapse of logic but, I really thought it could have been a classic if they had simply tweaked these elements and put some thought into human nature and common sense reactions.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I loved this show from the first episode. The setting and the 1960s fashions are spectacular. Sometimes it's incredibly nuanced satire and complex character study, and sometimes it's crazy, over-the-top \\"Dallas\\" style drama. I don't know how it's possible to do both at once, but it does.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that a lot of fascinating tension comes from the time period: all the rigid professional classes and gender roles are on the brink of collapse--or are they just about to sneak underground? It all looks so shocking yet so familiar...<br /><br />For more (600 pages more) on the bankruptcy of professional success in the 60s, see Joseph Heller's [[ASIN:0684841215 Something Happened]]. I also recommend Vance Packard's [[ASIN:097884310X The Hidden Persuaders]], which was about the ad industry and written in 1959.<br /><br />This is the only show I've ever liked so much that I built it into my schedule. It's SO GREAT!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|It looked TOO good! How is that a problem? Well, when you watch the TV show you get used to stuff looking a certain way. Everything at the SGC in this movie looked totally different presumably because they had a bigger budget (better lights, film camera, etc). I like the look, but if it's gonna veer so far from what people are used to it's gonna feel \\"off\\" somehow.<br /><br />But I really did love this movie. glad to have MOST of the Ori story wrapped up.<br /><br />I hope this show comes back to TV.
0689865384|4.0|While I like fantasy, I really am not into sci-fi or futuristic kinds of books. I never would have even tried this book except it has been flying off the shelves at our school library.  The story is about a futuristic society in which you are deemed ugly until 16 when you have a surgery to make you pretty.  The main character, Tally, is coerced into spying on a group of rebels who live in a place called \\"The Smoke\\".  She won't get to become pretty unless she agrees to do this.  I was on the edge of my seat until the end of the book trying to figure out how Tally would get out of the mess she made.  I was impressed by this story and would consider reading the rest of the series.
B000004712|5.0|All I had to hear was a small sample of \\"When can I see you\\" and I knew this one was a buy.  If you love classic Herbie before all the hip hop Herbie then this is a buy. This CD is one of Herbies best.  It has that looking at the sunset feeling.
B000TXZVGQ|2.0|At last, a show that deals with the tragedy of being young, beautiful and well-off. Boo-hoo-hoo.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|What can I say? I absolutely love this film. I try and watch it at least a couple of times per month. I have read the other reviews stating how the acting was horrible, or the cheesy shadows...pish posh. The focus of this adaptation was how Prince Vlad's love for Elizabeta never died. The film shows you how the picture of Mina brings back all of the joy inside the Count and his desperation to reach Mina to see her for himself. How can you not love the part where the Prince tells Mina that he is her servant? Hello all men out there!! There is no courtship these days, like what is portrayed in this movie. I wish that aspect existed in these times!! And no, dinner at Big Boy is NOT courtship!     I own the Superbit edition of this movie and there is a scene on the back cover where the Prince and Mina (in the red dress, boy what I wouldn't give to have that dress...)are at Rule's and he is just about to lock lips with her. I do not see that part in the actual movie. I wish there were more parts of them kissing. Is there some director's cut sitting out there waiting for us with more scenes?? Please say it does exist!

B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is simply the most transcendent animated film I have ever seen.  Before it came out, I felt the same way about The Little Mermaid.  When BATB came out I couldn't believe that TLM could be topped, but it was, and then some.  There's no need to repeat all the other reviewers' remarks - I can only say I got into this thanks to my children, and I will be enjoying it for the rest of my life (along with a number of other Disney classics like Dumbo, Lady and the Tramp and Jungle Book).  The characterizations, voice and animated, of all the characters is beyond description.  This is the last Disney animated feature I've seen where I appreciated the computer-assisted animation (the ballroom scene is unbelievable).  I consider Disney's output to have reached its absolute climax with this film - it's been all downhill since.  You can see the difference once it became all computer-generated.
0670018651|5.0|Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez have done what no one else has dared do in print---speak openly and critically of over one thousand fragrances.  Jan Moran's Fabulous Fragrances 2 is a wonderful must-have, but Moran does not look at fragrances critically.  The Perfume Guide by Susan Irvine, also a must-have, includes critiques of a number of fragrances and gives credit to the various perfumers, yet the scope of the book is limited by space and format.  What Luca and Tania have done is to present the consumer with a handy, highly readable and informative guide to the vastly expanding world of fragrance.  The introduction to the book covers almost 50 pages and has something for everyone, from the fragrance newbie to those of us who have been around the fragrance counter a few times.     Both LT and TS are very talented at what they do.   Luca has the talent of kissing prose into poetry.  His satisflyingly erudite allusions run the gamut from classical music to Horace's Odes to the Silver Screen (The Big Sleep, Michael Curtiz., e.g.) to Piltdown Man, and so on; if you're as long in the tooth as I am, these references are immediately understood and appreciated.  Tania is no less talented and many of her reviews are vivid and beautiful; reading them is like being at a show by a young painter whose work is of such depth that it moves you in an ineffable way.     As pointed out in earlier reviews, this book is important because it is not only written for the consumer but functions also as a wake-up call  and a challenge to the fragrance industry---\\"you're being watched and observed, and the changes being foisted rampantly upon some of the great classics are not un-noticed.\\"  One hopes that this book will bring about some badly needed change in an industry which operates mostly on the smoke and mirror concept (read: HYPE); sadly, the lover of fragrance is the loser when bean counters rule the day.   My distinct impression is that the authors' biting criticism of some perfumes is not directed at the wearer but instead directed at whoever is mandating either A) all these cheap smelling clones of Angel,  Pleasures, Cool Water, Tommy Girl; or B) changes in the great classics.  Thus, their criticism is designed for a purpose, and that purpose is not to hurt feelings but to effect change.   Luca and Tania aren't afraid to call a spade a spade.  Kudos to them for that.      Perfumes:  The Guide is not only informative but downright hilarious at times.  Some reviews are laugh out loud funny.  It's refreshing to see someone call a real stinker a real stinker without having the reader plow through a lot of superfluous language to get to the point.   This book is a great read and a must-have for perfume lovers both inside and outside the industry.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Very good movie, but why it's the second movie of the show? The first  was Jesse Stone \\"Stone Cold\\".But in the first is the result of the second! Anyway the both are excellent and Tom Selleck is a very good  actor.   A watch and keep it!
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder helps listeners crown him the great American songwriter of post-WWII with \\"Key of Life.\\" This set of music is a perfect combination of sensitive, meaningful lyrics, memorable melodies, exquisite sound production, and incredible musicianship. (Add in great guest spots from players like Herbie Hancock and George Benson, too.) Certainly we hear great soul music throughout, but the ballads - Love's in Need, I Am Singing, If It's Magic, just to name three - lead this listener to declare Stevie Wonder deserving of recognition for ages and generations to come as one of the greatest American songwriters of all time!
1400063515|4.0|I thought I might learn something from this book so finished it in two days including the afternoon of purchasing it.  It had a sharp pleasant start, then in the middle it became depressing and towards the end, there was light at the end of the tunnel - phew.    I did not feel that this book had anything earth shatteringly new, although Taleb emphasises his unique, totally unique grasp of the problem as if no one else had seen it before.  Of course he does  give a few quotes from the Bible, but then he criticizes so much.  I can forgive him all his foibles and criticisms bar one.  He shot the messenger at the start by saying that the Black Swan is an ugly bird.  Why shoot the bird?  The bird is an extraordinary, ornithological enigma and indeed as something of a naturalist, the title persuaded me.  Taleb does not seem to have a high regard for the natural world and says we should not be too guilty about species extinctions ... Something else that irritated me was when Taleb describes an issue and then says \\"more on this is chapter X ahead\\".  I could not always say that I held my breath with this prequel.  I prefer to eat my food without having to revisit it again and again too many times.    I learned about mediocristan and extrismistan and how bell curves don't help you make accurate financial forecasts.  I learned about the \\"narrative fallacy\\" and just how bad our assumptions are about how much we know.  I learned about bad Nobel prizes in economics and the importance of Mandelbrot and certain apparently vital French thinkers and philosophers including that science guru Popper and Poincare.  Finally, I also learned about Lebanon turning from hell to heaven and the tragedy of this all (really interesting).  This is my first book by a recent middle eastern intellectual - I don't normally read books from people in this part of the world if only because they have not written on anything that particularly interests me (leaving aside ancient history).  This at least makes the book worth it - I hope there are more like it from similar authors.    Taleb is a sycophant when it comes to the USA.  I grant him that the USA is a marvelous country, but how about some objectivity about the debt crises that the USA faces and - if he must give us his opinions free of charge, some frank views about politics and religion rather than various intellectual asides?    It's clear that he presents himself and his credentials as a scientist, scholar, polyglot and humanist rather than a businessman and stock market professional.  He likes to describe himself as a limousine driver - just to show that he does not suffer fools and would actually prefer to put his feet up with a good book.  Taleb is admirable and has chutzpah.    The failings of this book is that Taleb's major philosophical rant - that things are basically uncertain has been the core of ancient religions and philosophies the world over.  Leaving aside a Platonic fixity that Taleb uses as a bulwark to his arguments - a huge amount of ancient philosophical and spiritual rhetoric is about uncertainties ... and deep down we know the imperfections and the stench is unbearable.  Thanks for teaching me not to believe in the experts - sincerely, but Taleb's veiled dismissal of others in the pre-modern age who basically knew it the way he says it - suggests a lack of extensive reading.  Then again, Taleb is selective on his sources and only quotes from works contra his theses (? - something like that).    Yes we are victims of story telling - but actually it's worse.  I don't think Taleb does justice to the apparent Socratic quip that \\"I know one thing and that is I know nothing\\".    Well, I'm not going to give up on chasing after the rainbow, but thanks for telling me it's a futile enterprise.  This will certainly save me money - but don't let's forget that magic sometimes exists as well and luck could do with a fuller treatment, beyond that of chance.    A stimulating scientific exposition thatmany would benefit from.  I found this book very helpful in plotting a direction in life.  P.S., The Black Swan remains a beautiful bird.
185984054X|5.0|I was a little skeptical coming into this one because, like most other readers - well, maybe all - I came in with this naive notion of who Mother Teresa was simply because of the media surrounding her.  Did it surprise me to find out that Mother Teresa's image is propaganda, and that a lot of what she does or has done is for her own and her church's benefit?  Nope not a one bit.  We've seen this time and again, where someone's image is their own image they are pushing.  Howard Stern is a good example, who began proclaiming himself the King of All Media, and saying it enough, over and over again eventually made it so that the media actually started calling him that and people started believing it.  Did this proclamation come from someone qualified to state this?  Nope, from the horse's mouth itself.  The same is with Mother Teresa as she pushed her own image of what she wanted the world to see her to be.    Hitchens did wonderfully in deconstructing that image and showing her and her \\"charitable\\" organization for what they were and are.  Millions upon millions of money coming in and yet what is there to show for?  Her organizations are bare bones minimum, not even giving a hint that there are millions of dollars of charity money stored away somewhere.       The poor would benefit, you would think, since this was her life's message, that the poor should suffer happily in the squalor of the slums, only to have the pious and righteous believers take care of them so that they can show the world that they themselves are god's worshipers.  Hypocritical.  Anyway, Mother Teresa didn't believe in spending any money on the poor, such as antibiotics or other basic necessities, because, according to her, spend on one and you must spend on all.  Doctor's would visit and examine patients who are dying and have weeks to live, only to find that one cycle of antibiotics could cure them and they could live on and healthy!  Unbelievable because their response was the one above, give toone then give to all, and they couldn't possibly do that.  So the poor sap dies when a $100 cycle of antibiotics was too expensive to the multi million dollar charitable organization, whose sole purpose was to use the money for their benefit.  Same thing with other patients who are really dying and are clearly in pain.  Except they aren't given the pain medication that the poor would need to assist them in their transition to the \\"afterlife\\".    What makes this such an eye opener is how supported everything Hitchens wrote about was.  If you don't agree with Hitchens' views and opinions, that is one thing, but to read her own words, to see the proof with your very own eyes and to see the dots connected, is something completely different.  This well documented and supported short book about Mother Teresa is amazing, and my view of her is completely different.  Her church and the public view of a pious woman supporting the poor in order to show her faith is all that mattered to her.  The poor themselves?  Nope, but for her to serve them and for other believers to do the same, in order to further the piety needed to keep her \\"church\\" and \\"organization\\" alive.  A definite recommend.    5 stars.

B000ENWKN8|3.0|Now, I'm not a huge Zombie fan, but I really liked Hellbilly Deluxe, and once I recently saw the video for Foxy Foxy, I figured I should invest in another Zombie album.  Well, it's ok, but not quite as good as I had expected.  3 stars.  Now I wish I would have just downloaded the individual tracks in mp3, but Amazon didn't have that option, at least not yet at the time.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I've had the pleasure of seeing Muse live twice so far. I intend on seeing them live whenever they come around. It's really not an option for me. Once you have seen this band perform live, you are addicted. Now watching a DVD is not the same as being there of course, but this is the closest to being there as you can get. At least until an HD release. I've seem many live concert dvds and they usually have one of two problems. They overuse quick cuts and try to make it as exciting as they possibly can or they linger on shots too long and it becomes dull. With H.A.A.R.P. they have a perfect balance of great camera angles, quick cuts when they need it, but you still have time to see everything.    Being a musician I love watching each person play their instrument and with most concert dvds I have watched, they never seem to focus on that. Not with H.A.A.R.P. though. Here I got to see all of them playing and enjoying their instruments. In that aspect it was actually better than being there since you wouldn't get to see the concert from so many angles and up close. You get to watch as Matt Bellamy does his crazy tapping on Invincible, as Chris finger picks that great bass line to Hysteria, and as Dom effortlessly lays down solid beats for every song. It definitely focuses on Matt however, since he is the showman here. Granted they didn't play every song I wanted them to play, but they had a good mix of songs from all their albums.    The visuals are all great too. Muse knows how to put on a show. Giant screen behind them? Check. Giant satellites on stage? Check. Custom Manson guitars with built in KAOSS pad? Check. Girls hanging from floating balloons? Wait, what? I mean... Check. When you see these guys live it's like you are watching a live music video and when you see this dvd of them live, it really captures that feeling. Get this dvd playing on the biggest screen you have with the best sound system you have and you are going to love every minute of it. I've shown itto so man people and they always think that it was 30-45 minutes long at most, when really it's over an hour and half long. If you love Muse or if you just love music. This is the dvd for you.    As for the CD. It is a nice companion to the DVD. If you're a Muse addict like me then you'll have it on repeat in your car for a good month. It's from a different day so it's slightly different than the concert on the dvd and of course much shorter too. The reason you are buying this is for the DVD though. Think of the CD as a bonus.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|HOW I CAME TO KNOW ABOUT TAYLOR SWIFT?    THE BEGINNING    It's all thanks to the deejays at Fly Fm who kept playing her song Teardrops On My Guitar every single day. No kidding! I felt in love with that song the moment I first heard it. That prompted me to find out who is this Taylor Swift.     I googled her and I was led to her official site and her MySpace page.     THE MISSION    I then went on a mission to find her album which was released in the US in 2006. That mission was a tedious task and I found out something about our record stores, Tower Records, Speedy, CD Rama, MPH/Border's music section and Rock Corner do not have her album in stock. The worst part was, they have no idea who Taylor Swift is. I would get responses such as Taylor who? How do you spell it? T-A-I-L-...No it's T-A-Y-L-O-R. Swift as in Suzuki Swift. How do you spell that? Yeah we are living in a generation that doesn't read much.     I found it strange that all of our local stores do not have her CD. Was it because it was release in 2006 and was out of print? I doubt it. I didn't bother checking other record stores in other states because if two fairly big cities do not have the album, how likely it is for them to have it in their store. Oh before I forget, I'm residing in a country called Malaysia.     THE ALTERNATIVE     So I had no choice but to purchase it through Amazon. Here's the amazing part. I ordered the CD knowing only one song. That's pretty risky. But that's me. If I like a certain song, I'd go all out to get the entire album. Original disc only. The 30 seconds preview of each song on Amazon did not help either as it doesn't determine whether I'm into that particular song or not. But I love Teardrops so it doesn't matter if the rest of the songs suck.     So did it sucks? Hell No! I absolutely love every one of them. Taylor's CD is the second most expensive CD that I've purchased. The first was The Corrs In Blue album. Same story.     THE ALBUM    Taylor's debut album is a mixture of Pop and Contemporary Country music. For me to choose a favorite is pretty tough as all of the tracks are just excellent especially Teardrops, Cold As You and A Place In This World.    THE SINGER    I love singers who write their own songs. Taylor Swift is no exception. She wrote 3 out of the 11 songs. The rest of it she co-wrote it with her dearest friend and her song writing soul mate Liz Rose and one song with Robert Ellis Orral and Angelo.     HER VOICE    Her own unique voice is simply mesmerizing. It's like walking on a clouded bed. That's how I would describe it.     This is one of the best album I've recently purchased. I've absolutely no regrets whatsoever.     and    Amazon Rocks!!! Why?    It's so easy to order and they are extremely efficient. Keep it up.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|This movie is not great. Its terrible and I do not recommend it to anyone.
1591841666|4.0|This, being 4th or 5th Godin-book, I have browsed through (reading may be an overstatement, since Godin's books are always as-easy-as-it-gets), leaves me with the feeling: the book could have been even shorter... it is that much to the point.    The best thing the book does - it restates the obvious point - be critical to yourself and DO make decisions that are rooted in this criticism. Since people in many cases are more reluctant to change than not, yet change is a must in these many cases, the Dip is what may pull you over the edge. And over the edge you should.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I picked up TROY on a whim.  I was in the grocery store; it was cheap, so what the heck, I added the DVD to my bread and milk.  And I guess Charlton Heston's recent demise made me want to see an old fashioned, 'Hollywood' take of an epic subject.<br /><br />What a surprise TROY is.  I remember it only garned so-so official reviews, with lots of semi-snide comments about Brad Pitt's pecs and his newly refined accent, etc.  Even though this version isn't the 196 minute director's cut, which is supposed to supply more narrative flow, I'm impressed enough with this version to recommend it.  Any one of the various battle scenes, certainly, are worth the price.  It's been ages since I read The Iliad, and that was for college lit class (so \\"ages\\" is the appropriate word), but I didn't have any trouble following the narrative.  I've read snobbish carping comments about TROY's lack of fidelity to The Iliad, but I never look to a Hollywood film for literary or historical accuracy -- just a good story well told.<br /><br />If Brad Pitt isn't quite the greatest actor here (and I hope the director's cut might change that impression), the performances of Brian Cox; Eric Bana; Peter O'Toole and Sean Bean more than make up for Pitt's occasional flatness.  Personally, I didn't sense much chemistry in his scenes with Rose Byrne.  I think Pitt's best scenes were during his meeting with King Priam (Hector's father), and what happens afterward.  Also, Pitt's scenes with Brian Cox as the contemptable King Agamemmnon; these scenes have energy and passion.  The viewer knows they hate each other, but each is forced to use the other, if only temporarily.<br /><br />For me, the brief scenes portraying the relationship between Eric Bana (Hector) and the actress who plays his wife, are more sensual and emotionally affecting than anything between Orlando Bloom (Paris) and Diane Kruger (Helen), and/or Brad Pitt and Rose Byrne.  I think it's the fact that Hector is happily married and just wants to savor his life with his wife and son; that does it... at least for me.  Sure, illicit love has its moments, but married and happy, the way Eric Bana plays it, is very sexy too.  (Think GLADIATOR, when all Maximus really wanted was to return home to his wife and son.  A woman likes to see that kind of thing!)<br /><br />So in all, I was pleasantly impressed and surprised by TROY.  Now I'd like to see the director's cut.h his wife and son; that does it... at least for me.  Sure, illicit love has its moments, but married and happy, the way Eric Bana plays it, is very sexy too.

B000A7DVRC|4.0|There is not much else to say, that 600 some odd viewers have not said already. That's actually a tell tale sign that a film has to be pretty decent. Few films get that many reviews.    Well a few thoughts coming to mind...Jeff Bridges rocks and who doesn't love John Goodman? The characters that these two actors play are just fantastic Coen Brothers creations. As I watched there 7th film, I just can't help but admire the Coen's creativity and direction.    This said, I am completely stumped by the ending of this film. I guess I wanted the film to go out in a big BANG, but the film just didn't do that. It ended laid back and cool. It ended as though nothing ever happened and I guess, for \\"The Dude\\", this was the case as nothing really changed in his life. This is a film for just about anyone out there, but two kinds of people in particular come to mind; action or heist film junkies and stoners. Enjoy!!
1878424602|5.0|I heard about this book years ago, but was put off by the concept of 'success', assumming that this was another 'get rich and successful quick' book. But I was coverted to Deepak's work when I saw the Way of the Wizard recommended on Eckhart Tolle's website. And now I love this book. The concept of 'success' isn't defined in narrow material terms, of course. And the spiritual concepts are presented in a pure and profound form. So thanks to Eckhart's recommended reading list - a great source of fantastic books, such as De mello's awareness and The Fall by Steve Taylor.

0307237702|4.0|Barack's latest book is interesting and well written. The author has a very uplifting life story. A third generation Muslim of wealth, gets abandonded by his African father at two, ends up in Indonesia in Muslim school, and is eventually raised by his white grandparents in Hawaii. To overcome all of this and still turn out successful is admirable. He writes of hope and optimism living in the US, and stresses pursuing your dreams in life. The book contains an agenda, and covers dozens of major political issues. This is a good read, and is clearly written by the candidate, unlike others who clearly hide behind their ghost writers.  Though totally different than politics, Another candid book that seems to be the honest truth is [[ASIN:0981463002 Bobby Brown: The Truth, The Whole Truth and Nothing ButÃ¢Â¦]]I am looking forward to receiving the copy I ordered.  He too, seems to have had an interesting life. I admire when a person can be open and honest with the world about what they have gone through in order to help someone else.
0321334876|5.0|Is this a great book? I have been asking myself that question ever since I found out that Scott Meyers does not write (or has not written for a long time) production code in C++. With that said, book is a great theoretical treatise on how to make your C++ code better but it is not a \\"cookbook\\" which will be immediately useful in day to day tasks. This is not necessarily a bad thing; such approach will encourage deeper understanding of issues at hand and that will lead to better code.
0743496736|5.0|This is a very good book.  After reading it, I did find myself thinking about my high school and who was bullied and wasn't.  Also, I never thought about how the family must feel after thier son/daughter does something so awful.  Once again, Jodi Picoult made you think about something you may not have wanted to.  I think this book should be taught in a high school class.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I purchased this set as a gift for my husband on his birthday.  He loves all sci-fi, but he has a special place in his heart for Star Trek.  I was a little concerned after reading about some of the issues that some buyers encountered - cumbersome packaging, poor quality, etc. - but my concerns were quickly dispelled.  When he first saw what was in the box, my husband's eyes lit up like a kid on Christmas morning.  He immediately opened the package with no problem (as a matter of fact, he specifically commented that he really liked how it was packaged) and popped a disk into the player.  He was thrilled with the audio and visual qualities as well; he thought they were great. Bottom line:  Great product and well worth it for a true Trekkie!
B0001I55SS|4.0|In a review below, Dave observes, \\"It's almost as if they thought they had a great sci-fi movie in their hands, but the contract said: \\"kid's stuff\\". \\"    I totally agree. I had the same exact thought while watching this recently, for the first time in over two decades. It feels very much like a film whose target audience for the first hour should properly be adults and older teenagers, but one that's had kids' elements bolted onto it at a late stage. The scene with Holland rescuing Kate from the \\"hospital\\" later on in the film is the epitome of this, with the heroic-sounding overture (so different in feel from the rest of Barry's brooding, menacing score) feeling literally bolted on. Ditto for the laser gun shoot-out with the line of sentries on the bridge: a scene and an accompanying musical cue that feel totally out of place alongside the menacing first two acts with their slow-burning pace.    And, I mean, this is a film which [SPOILERS] has as its central revelation the fact that the original crew of the Cygnus have been turned into *zombified slaves*, and which has a central character killed by a robot that drives whirling blades into his chest. This is the stuff of horror stories. In terms of its atmosphere The Black Hole has a lot in common with dark 70s films such as The Stepford Wives and The Clonus Horror. It's shocking in retrospect that Disney gave it a green light as a mainstream film aimed at children.    Make no mistake, there is clunkiness throughout the movie, and a third act collapse. But if The Black Hole is a failure, it's a really fascinating one (a bit like David Lynch's \\"Dune\\"), which is why I've given it four stars. The first hour is very slow moving, and kids would surely have been bored by it, but for an adult it holds a genuinely mesmerising quality, helped in no small part by the sumptuous set designs and John Barry's swirling, brooding score.    Great movie? No. Recommended nevertheless? Yes.
0618164413|3.0|I read a couple of these to my daughter, and they are ok.  But one really struck me as uncomfortably strange - \\"George goes to the moon\\". It is about curious george taking part in experiments in space - and how much fun he has doing so.      I looked for another in the series say \\"curious george and the polio vaccine\\" or \\"curious george volunteers to visit the vivisectionists\\" or even \\"curious george and the bush meat trade\\".    I understand why we need to experiment on animals.  But there is something wrong in us pretending to kids that it's fun for the animal.
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I know more people who don't like Anderson's movies than those who do, and The Darjeeling Limited confirms something I must come to grips with. I understand why it is people don't like his movies, yet I can't pin down why I do, I just know I do. I found this film to be his most emotionally satisfying. The story concerns three brothers who have lost touch with each other since the death of their father. They are brought together by the oldest of the three,played by Owen Wilson, with a secret agenda to meet up with their estranged mother. On the surface he's asked his brothers Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman to join him on a spiritual journey aboard an Indian passenger train. Like Anderson's other films this one does not hold to a conventional movie plot, but the train does serve to set up a physical journey as well as a spiritual one. The most moving and emotional sequence concerns the brothers and two seperate funerals. In this sequence we see what is at the heart of their spirtual disconnect and also a discreet commentary on the differences between those in the east and us in the west. The DVD contains a short film that was not in the theatrical release, The Hotel Chevalier, that one could include in the movie or view on its own. This sequence doesn't enhance the story really, but does explain some elements involving Schwartzman's character and a shot featuring Natalie Portman. One great thing about this short movie is a revealing shot of Portman who has famously stayed clear of nudity in the past. As with Anderson's other films this one has some great music in the background that gives his characters and setting a sense of sadness and humor that is unique to his films. One aspect of this movie that seemed to not get enough attention is the photography by DP Robert Yeomman. India is at times bright and electric and other times muted and subtle. This DVD is worth exploring even if you don't know why.
B00127RAJY|5.0|As someone who is in pretty decent shape, Jillian put me to SHAME.  I love the Biggest Loser, and especially admire Jillian for her training techniques.  I hadn't bought any of her DVDs before because of the mixed reviews and the necessary equipment.  For this work out, all that is necessary is a pair of hand weights.    A bit skeptical of the three leveled work outs, I started with Level 1, just to get a \\"feel.\\"  Well, within 5 minutes, I was yelling at the television for some relief.  The next day I was so sore.  My five pound weights felt like 50s.  While the workouts were about 25 minutes each, I definitely felt like I got a workout.  Totally recommended this one for a booty kicking fun time.
0525950079|5.0|Although I have enjoyed most of Ken Follett's books throughout the years, he is at his best when he tackles complex projects with multiple story lines.  I would put World Without End a notch below Pillars of the Earth, but it is still a very captivating book.  It was probably written in response to the level of popularity Pillars realized after Oprah gave it her blessing twenty years after its publication; however, that makes little difference.  After years of books that can best be described as readable, it's nice to have him back at the top of his game.
B000005RQT|5.0|Aloha Deep Purple fans everywhere!!!    The orignal american release opens with \\"Speed King\\" sprinting out of the blocks into the field of what rock music was then being piped through FM-bandwaves, much being \\"mellow\\", though as many recall Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath had already been introduced to world and we were hungry for more rock musical muscle and prowess as was being flaunted in the then \\"bring it\\" times.  The opening track intro, on this remaster, has been restored and explodes(an animated video would showing the original Mount Rushmore site exploding leaving the \\"In Rock\\" visage in its place as the quieter part of this intro reps the rocks falling away?) deceptively lulling the listner into chill-mode only to throw-up the lights as the familiar chords of the american intro slash all opening aural expectations - individual preference aside, I gotta say it sounds great and may have changed the way we heard the album back then but it wouldn't have changed an iota of the humongous talent that was about take the unsuspecting world by the ears and hold their attention for the better part of the next 4-albums that would follow from this line-up MKII.    For fans who had this album, this will take you back to why you listened in the first place; to those who never heard them, never heard this album or who are looking back to search out some of the roots, you will either be grabbed from the onset, require a full-listen or perhaps possibly wonder what the hoopla was about.  Bottomline for me is this is vintage-rock and as with most vintage rock, please keep that volume on 11 and by the way, there are no backwards messages or occult leanings here just straight-forward rock and no filler.  On a personal note, the best rocking bands were also funky and Deep Purple were no exception.    The bonus tracks on this 25th Anniversary release make for a great value and great listening, though neither add nor take from the remastered original album tracks. They do give a glimpse into what they might have done had the technology been available.  If you had an older brother or sister who liked them then, buy this and have them over for a barbeque, put this on, let the party begin.

B00001OH7G|5.0|When Rory and his killer band toured Ireland in 1974, other reviewers have got it dead right that the majority of rock acts wouldn't go near the place. The Gaelic funsters were in the full throes of murdering and torturing their fellow man. So the Melody Maker, Britain's best-ever and sadly defunct music weekly (written by such five-star observers as Ray Coleman and Chris Welch - see my review of Chris' book \\"Cream\\"), had as its front-page headline, \\"Rory rocks Belfast,\\" followed by an ecstatic description of not only his fantastic playing and band, but of his single-minded belief that music would break down all barriers.    I first saw Rory in 1968 when, as I said in many other reviews, he blew poor old Jimi H off the stage at the Woburn Abbey Festival. I got to know him quite well and have, among other things, one of Richie McCraken's bass guitar string cases on which Rory wrote his name and addresses of his agents for booking. I loved this man and his music, and preferred him to almost any other musician in the world. I find him much more intresting than Duane Allman (there is no law against playing in tune, D) or Stevie Ray Vaughan, and miles better than Hendrix, who was usually so awful live. He interpreted the blues in an unbelievably sensitive and skilful way, never forgetting his comprehensive respect and knowledge of the greats (he adored Muddy Waters, Blind Blake, Hutto, Albert King and so on). Coupled with that, he was a pretty good singer and a first-rate song-writer, as well as being a great guitarist, slide player, mandolin player, harp player and sax player. I lost count of the times (well over 38) I saw Rory say, \\"Thanks a million, thanks a million,\\" in his inimitable brogue before holding an audience spellbound with one acoustic guitar.    This fantastic record of Rory includes \\"A Million Miles Away\\", Walk on Hot Coals,\\", \\"I wonder who,\\", \\"Who's that coming, \\" and a host of other gems, all played by the band of bands. Listen to Rod D'Ath's drums, Gerry McEvoy's bass and Lou Martin's drums. Primitive gear, stunning playing. Who can hold a candle to this gentle, polite, kind and decent man? Please let us stop comparing him to the usual suspects - he was in a different league in so many ways and the world is just beginning to wake up. He was quite unique in so many ways. Listen to the \\"London Muddy Waters Sessions\\" - he's the only one who really \\"got it.\\"    Essential and vital listening. Much more enjoyable than the disjointed DVD by Tony Palmer.

B000NVIXDW|4.0|Michael Buble's first two albums introduced us to him and his genre... he brought swing back, at least to many of us for whom swing was the stuff of decades ago. With this album he expressed his desire to make it different and yet something he'd be proud to give his listeners, and I think he has succeeded. Call Me Irresponsible sees Buble putting his own spin on old classics and ballads, and adding a few of his own compositions.    For those who've become accustomed to the sound of his first two albums and are doubtful of hearing something new, as I was, listen to this with an open mind. With bossa nova, acapella, Latin flavours, R&B and even a gospel choir in the mix, this album is innovative and diverse, yet still very much the Michael we've come to love, and more definitive of his direction as an artist. With focus and versatility like that, it's not hard to believe that for Buble, the best is yet to come.
0312323867|5.0|I recently read this book after reading \\"Something Borrowed.\\"  While I liked \\"Something Borrowed\\" and was surprised to realize the sequel was from the perspective of the \\"bad guy\\"  I decided to continue reading.  I ended up absolutely loving this book, actually preferring it to \\"Something Borrowed\\".  This is a total comfort feel good book and left me wanting more.  I highly reccommend this book for anytime but definitely if someone's a little blue, this book is just what the Dr. ordered.      I rarely if ever write reviews and felt compelled to do so in this instance.
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I Am Legend showed a lot of promise through the trailers and plot synopses, but I thought failed to deliver the expected product. Will Smith delivered a strong performance and was the star of this film in more ways than the obvious, momentarily allowing the viewer to overlook the rushed storyline (primarily in the second half), confusing message, cliche tear-jerkers, and yawn-inspiring reliance on computer animation.    While the first 30 minutes or so developed nicely and showed promise for the rest of the film, the remainder seemed rushed and under-developed. If this was an intentional directing style designed to reflect the developing insanity and instability of Smith's character, I highly commend the director. Unfortunately nothing else in the movie would lead me to believe that this could be true.    It seemed for a while that the movie was working toward some focused moral or comment on human nature, but the result was muddled, and seemed to lose its integrity in lieu of CGE (computer-generated entertainment) so that the viewer can't quite tell what the director's vision actually was. Anticipating a departure from the modern blockbuster of this nature, I was disappointed.    Without going into details (trying to avoid \\"spoilers\\" here), you can expect to see every nearly every imaginable cliche cinematic tear-jerker, which work with varying success. However, the viewer is ultimately left either excessively distressed or excessively irritated, and in both cases asking whether they were really necessary.    The CG creatures were another point of contention for me. Although I realize the symbolism between CG bodies and the idea that the creatures have been left completely devoid of human nature, I couldn't help but get flashbacks from \\"I, Robot\\" (Will Smith can never work with CG humanoids again). Those looking for a frightening zombie movie will probably be disappointed by those Smith actually encounters.    Overall the film is worth watching once, but don't expect something much different than a post-1995 computer-generated blockbuster.
B0012OQZWA|5.0|Origin really knows how to tear it up and Relapse should be commended for such a an awesome roster of bands. some bands on the roster stand out more than others and Origin is an example. I hope that Relapse gets more artists that know how to give the eardrums a brass-knuckled beatdown.
B000TGELLY|2.0|This version of the film has a dramatically different score than the original (some parts of James Horner's score are still there, but many of the key dramatic moments in the film seem completely different with the new score). Nearly all of the vocal elements of the original score have been scrapped, making this Director's Cut seem like your average action movie (the music in the theatrical version is what set it apart from other mediocre action films of the time).<br /><br />The added footage is nice (a lot of the new scenes develop the characters a bit more), but the loss of the original score was a major disappointment for me.<br /><br />I prefer the theatrical version, and I suggest renting this one (or borrowing it from a friend, like I did) before purchasing it.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|\\"Death is pretty final,<br />I'm collecting vinyl.<br />I'm gonna DJ<br />at the end of the Worrrrlllllddd!!!\\"<br /><br />So blurts Michael Stipe on the best REM album since the 90's. Combining the brevity of [[ASIN:B00005ICAW Weezer's Green Album]] with the dense sonic pow of [[ASIN:B000003TAL Sonic Youth]], \\"Accelerate\\" is REM's hardest rocking album to date, and their noisiest album since the glamfest of [[ASIN:B000002MU3 Monster]]. Why people call this a return to form is completely beyond me, as it sounds unlike anything else in their three decade career. The (in my opinion) under-rated [[ASIN:B0002W4UVG Around the Sun]] was the true return to form; songs like \\"Final Straw\\" and \\"Leaving New York\\" had more in common with [[ASIN:B000002MG1 Automatic for the People]] then anything here.<br /><br />But it became the first album since [[ASIN:B000002UW1 Document]] to not go top 10, so obviously Buck, Mills and Stipe spent the last three years contemplating where the new direction should be. They finally decided, as a line in the title track goes, to \\"fall in a new direction,\\" then cranked the amps to eleven and let'er rip. What was introspective and contemplative three years before is now exploding outwards in a live frenzy of guitars, feedback and righteous indignation with a healthy dose of [[ASIN:B000UEIGB6 The Stooges' Funhouse]] thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Given that much of ATS was a glum look at the state of the union, the angry politicking on \\"Accelerate\\" is like a bootkick of fresh air. \\"Don't turn your talking points on me,\\" snaps Stipe, barking about that which history will eventually record as a bad footnote. Like many of the best REM albums, the lyrics are also near unintelligible, Stipe barking and mumbling with REM's super secret harmonizing weapon Mike Mills adding the sweetener. Peter Buck is allowed to be loud again, with his crunchy guitar fuzz amped up on the terrific \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" and the ferocious \\"Living Well is The Best Revenge.\\"<br /><br />Like U2 did on [[ASIN:B00004Z0LW All That You Can't Leave Behind]], REM have realized that there's really nothing wrong with playing to your strengths, or for that matter, just playing for the sheer thrill of rocking out. While some of the more solemn moments (\\"Houston\\" in particular) throw in a minute or two of sedation, the bulk of \\"Accelerate\\" is a pedal-to-the-metal adrenaline joyride.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I don't buy many soundtracks, but I loved the film and its music so much I just had to have this one. The melodies and arrangements are soul-stirring and will take you back to the glorious English countryside where the best scenes took place. For me, breathtaking moments occurred in A Postcard to Henry Purcell, Liz on Top of the World, and Your Hands Are Cold.   As this is a soundtrack, several musical themes do reoccur, but they are wonderfully woven in with the orchestration such that they never seem repetitive or dull. The Military Marches In, Meryton Townhall and Another Dance lighten the mood periodically, before Marianelli pulls you back to nostalgia and romanticism, which I would consider the main feel of this soundtrack. I find it great listening, especially for quiet evenings in.
B0000542D2|5.0|It was great to see this dvd presented with excellant picture quality and (caution: lower the volume on your sound system) booming but great sound. You can tell a lot of pride was put into reproducing this dvd.It's GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! Bring on \\"Let it Be\\"!
0553805460|3.0|Whether or not you will enjoy this book, as evidenced by the many polarized reviews, is if you truly need to like the main character.    Jordan Belfort is the epitome of the stereotypical fraternity boy. Not only did he party like a rock star, through his sex and drug addictions, but he was also (according to him) the best thing since sliced bread. He tries to wow you with how much money he made (and spent), how people looked up to him and worshipped the ground he walked on, the wild drug-induced adventures, and screwing over anyone who stood in his way. You won't like him. His constant bragging over hundreds of pages, along with a writing style that will grate on you after a while, may test your patience (although some of the childish comments will elicit some laughs).    You won't like Jordan until the last part of the book, where he has a life-changing event that forces him to sober up and realize the pain he inflicted on his wife and kids. You start to feel sorry for him despite how bad he's acted in the earlier parts of his life.    Given the above comments, it's no wonder why people have such love/hate reviews. Some people will utterly despise Jordan because of his actions and lack of remorse. Others will think he's 'cool' and be amazed at his power over others, and the corruption.    Which best describes you? Your answer will go a long way in telling whether you'll like this book.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|My wife and I saw this in the theater.  The handcam viewpoint almost made my wife ill with the shaking and occassional spinning around looking for the bad guys.  I just thought it was cheesy - an attempt by a usually good director to jump on a supposed hot trend.  When you are shooting a monster movie where you are supposed to SEE and CARE about what they are running from, giving the audience a good shot of the monster for a few seconds TOTAL TIME is... lame (I have no better polite word for it).  I would not recommend this movie to anyone except a diehard fan of the director or someone that just has to have every movie of a particular genre.

B0015AARJI|4.0|This is essentially what should've shipped with the PS3 as of launch. However, due to lawsuits and Sony PR, it had to be delayed up until now. I love the heavier feel to the controller and it seems the battery lasts just as long as the original sixaxis' battery. THe rumble works great with games like Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, and Uncharted. It doesn't miss a step with the PS2 games (assuming you have a B/C compatible PS3). There's not much to say other than that. If you own a PS3 you probably got used to the L2 & R2 buttons/triggers, and have mixed reactions to the motion sensing tech. I say if you miss rumble, get this. If you don't have a PS3 and plan on buying one soon, wait until June when the controller starts shipping with the system.
B000IZJZLM|5.0|This is a wonderful listening experience. I've enjoyed all their other CD's and this is no exception.
B000IJ6QTC|5.0|I do own all three 2 disc sets as separate units. I haven't seen them for less than 10 bucks each as one reviewer says, but I have seen them available at Walmart for $12.99 each and that's a real good price. Also the picture looks really good for both the special editions and the original versions. The special editions are enhanced and are slightly better than the originals, but the orignals look as they should. The same way as shown in the theater in their first run. I don't know what \\"animorphic\\" and \\"non-animorphic\\" is. Those words have no meaning for me. I watch either version and enjoy it very much. These discs were viewed on both a glass tube television and an LCD widescreen tv. Everyone was pleased with the picture and couldn't believe when I told them of all the negative reviews complaining of picture quality. If you're still skeptical about what I have said, see if you can rent them or borrow them and judge for yourself. My beef is that these movies did not have the limited 3 months availabilty  like the Lucasfilms publicity machine said they would have. So I rushed to get them. I COULD HAVE SAVED ABOUT $6.36! You can still buy them. If the tin is important to you and money is no object, GO FOR IT! May the force be with you.
1400082773|4.0|Often, I have found that gifted orators aspire to be equally good writers.  Barack Obama is truly both an excellent orator and now, in this book, I find he is also a very good writer.  There are many peaks and few valleys--occasionally, a little wordy-- in his narrative which unveils a curious and honest intellect and an empathy groomed from his extensive experience with people.  I think there are many telling, subliminal-\\"esque\\" passages which exposes many underlying qualities and some shortcomings in his character.  I see, too, an innate ability to adapt to circumstances.  A good story, a good read and quite objective for this type of work; well worth the price and time.  Interestingly, I understand him a little better, now.     Thank you.
1559408855|4.0|I don't know where to start except maybe the storyline for starters.  It is based in Italy around 1945ish.  The story starts with a group of young adults/teenagers get forced into going with these 5 or 6 men and 3 to 5 older women that are seemingly in power of sorts.  They seem quite wealthy too.  Most of the young people seem wealthy as the story would indicate that they came from prominent families.      The older men and women then take the younger people to a large mansion that is very nice and then they are subjected to hours of extremely graphic and erotic stories from the older women(which were obviously prostitutes).  From there the story just goes on with one unusual sexual scene after another.  The older men slowly progress from \\"normal\\" sexual encounters to more sadistic sexual acts of torture.  THEY EVEN HAVE SEX WITH EACH OTHER.  It's just a movie about sexual DEGREDATION and so on and so forth.    As far as the outside of the storyline, the movie is filmed very well and sort of reminded me of BARRY LYNDON as far as filming technique and costumes(or lack of) and sets.    If you are thinking the movie has hot or erotic sex scenes that are appealing to the eyes, you aren't going to like this.  Yes, the nudity is virtually endless, but the characters are very dry for the simple fact that you have no emotional connection with them.      Overall, the movie is as TASTEFUL and ARTSY as it can be for what it is, but it's still very untasteful at the same time.  Only a small percentage of moviegoers would actually enjoy this movie.  It is pretty tough to sit through.  I've noticed some people say that it is nothing compared to the blood fests of today's movies.  Well, this movie is all the more gory because there are no holds barred and it is more of a sexual nature, not someone cutting off heads with a chainsaw or something like that.  Weird SEXUAL THEMES make people uncomfortable.  It is very shocking in the sense that it stays with you for a few days.  It doesn't have any jump out and scare you cheaply scenes.  You don't watch it and not think about it again.  It stays with you.
B000ZOXDFA|3.0|Elizabeth I is considered by many to be among the most significant and fascinating monarchs to ever walk the earth.  She is also regarded as among the most beloved as well.  To create a lush and dramatic series of films about her long and storied rule is by no means unexpected, nor is it very original as the amount of on-screen interpretations of Elizabeth directly reflects the fascination we have in pondering the meaning of her reign.  Elizabeth:  The Golden Age is Shekhar Kapur's sequel to [[ASIN:B000RF7XYO Elizabeth]], a film that introduced us to the famous queen and showed us the first part of her reign.  It's funny, I've been watching Showtime's the [[ASIN:B000XV6VOK The Tudors]] and the most recent episodes have shown us Elizabeth's birth and even a little bit about Mary I, the queen that proceeded her and the daughter of Catherine of Aragon .  Given the nature of the hedonistic protagonists Anne Bolyn and King Henry VIII on that show and its positive portrayal of victimized Catholics such as Saint Thomas More, it was quite refreshing to see the Catholic Church in the interrogation room once again, perhaps where it belongs.  Anyway, the significance in the quasi-history portrayed on both this film and that show compliment each other quite nicely as Spain during the second half of Elizabeth's rule was an absolute god-fearing behemoth and a force to be reckoned with.  Some people have said this film is Anti-Catholic but really, these are the days of the inquisition we're watching.  It might be a task to stay balanced.<br /><br />Elizabeth is fundamentally very easy to sympathize with, after all it isn't really her fault her father was a pervert and her mother his mistress.  Nevertheless, Cate Blanchett has so much range that her performance quietly shows us her less obvious flaws.  I'm convinced that no other actress could portray this queen in a way that justifies her reputation.  The cast is actually great even beyond her though, which is not unlike the first film.  Walter Raleigh is played by Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush is Francis Walsingham and Mary, Queen of Scots is played with great villainy by Samantha Morton.  The film follows the Battle of Gravelines in the Anglo-Spanish War as it's primary battle scene but most of the film is focused on the amazing costumes, music, and sets.  It also ponders Elizabeth's interpersonal relationships.<br /><br />There are massive historical inaccuracies that are for the most part done to heighten drama but some are pretty inexplicable (where the hell was Robert Cecil?).  I guess the inaccuracies would be inconsequential if I didn't also believe that 99% of the audience would see The Golden Age as their only reference to the virgin queen.  I'm not so sure I can forgive that but I know many viewers will.  Elizabeth's famous speech to the troops at Tilbury before the invasion of the Spanish Armada is widely documented but for those who don't know it is regarded as fact, the scene comes off as derivative of just about every Hollywood epic period film made in the last twenty years.  Blanchett is not at fault but her plate armor and lack of femininity in the way the scene is directed actually brought back the long forgotten memories of Milla Jovovich's speech as Joan of Arc in the pathetically amateur Luc Besson film [[ASIN:0767845722 The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc]].  That isn't to say The Golden Age is as bad a film, it is not.  It captures the magic expected of a portrayal of this leader in flashes but misses the opportunity to capture her most significant speech.  They actually blew it.<br /><br />Anyway, very good looking film with some really great acting, but take heed; the history buffs might take issue with the accuracy, while the movie buffs might mistakenly walk out thinking they've learned something.  I'd like to consider myself a little bit of both so consider this a mixed review leaning toward a partial recommendation for the visuals and performances.Walter Raleigh is played by Clive Owen, Geoffrey Rush is Francis Walsingham and Mary, Queen of Scots is played with great villainy by Samantha Morton.

B000W4HFY8|4.0|For anyone out there who was or is a Twin Peaks fan, the second season soundtrack is for you.  It is one of thoes CDs that you can put in, hit repeat and listen to all day long.  Amazon.com has it for a reasonable price.  That's what we need, good music, reasonabilly priced.
B0012Y22KO|1.0|I would just like to comment on what the previous reviewer stated.<br /><br />I do not own this collection, but I know exactly what he is talking about.  And for a band that is so tight and clean. you would think they earned a delux set, not just a bare boned transfer that Sony has done here.  I own the 2005 DSD remastered Japan editions.  These are much more worthy of you hard earned dollar.  All artwork is clean and sharp.  The colors are fresh and clean.  Not like the US CD issues.  As mention in the previous post. The US editions are flat interms of sound and a faded looking cover art.<br /><br />  But when you play the japenese editions you hear the HUGE difference in sound.  The volume level just alone, and you do get that warm sound feel on the 7th one CD+ a bonus Track called the 7th one, which is a kinda jam session.  That song is only available on the Japenese editon.<br />It seems like Japan does everything right, great remastering, bonus tracks, sometimes extra booklets.  Anyway not to get to much off the subject.  It would be nice here in America TOTO would get the delux treatment of there 1st 7 albums.  Including some bonus tracks and demos.<br /><br />If anyone is interested in getting there ToTo collection started with Japenese DSD Mastered editons, I have 2 extra copies of the 1st album and Isolation album in that form for sale.  I know this series is out of print, but is for sale on ebay from different sellers.  Usualy about 20.00 to 37.00 per + shipping.  Depends on the which one you want.  If you want to buy one of 2 I have for sale shot me an e-mail  mikesippie@yahoo.com.  Maybe one day SONY will get it right.....We alwys have to pay top dollar for the imports  Mike S.

B000YDOOUK|5.0|Awesome band!  Awesome music!  The next great \\"hair band\\" is here.  The first time I heard their music on the radio I was blown away.  The first radio station in America to play Airbourne's music was 98 Rock in Baltimore.      Airbourne has a great heavy metal, high energy sound.  Think of it like Jackyl singing AC/DC music.  They definitely sound a bit like AC/DC....BUT make no mistake about it, they have a sound of their own that's incredible.  A sound that will make them the next great hard rock band.      I bought the CD as soon as it was available in America at the end of January, 2008.   One of the best CD's I ever bought, there's not a bad song on the album.  The song 'Diamond in the rough' kicks A**.  I went to see them live at the Recher Theater in Towson, Md.  Outrageously incredible show, they rocked.  They sound fantastic live and the energy they bring is second to none.  You could tell from the beginning (of the show) these guys are for real, they aren't wanna bees, they aren't fake.  I was literally 20 feet from the stage and you could see the expressions on the band members faces, you could see the 'heart' and determination they bring to their music.  I consider myself blessed to have seen these guys up close and in person at the Recher 'cause in a couple years it will be hard to get tickets when they are playing in front of large crowds.    Airbourne ROCKS!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|It isn't always easy to find the words to describe a great film.  It is just that every ten years or so there is a film that lifts me up and forces me to take a deeper look at some facet of my life, in this case an understanding of value for my own personal freedom.  The Shawshank Redemption feels like a deeply personal film for me.  It gets under my skin and by its conclusion I want to well up like a big baby no matter how many times I've seen it.  I know that other people feel the same way I do about this film but I never approach them to ask why and I only sometimes decide to express a feeling like that in writing, like I am now.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare films that reflects something real enough that I can almost empathize with its characters for two hours, at least enough that I find a new respect for the life I have.  After all, no murderer is only that.  He or she is or was a son or daughter to someone; maybe a wife, a husband, a lover, or a best friend to others.  That doesn't make anyone's crimes more or less forgivable, it just provides more than a one-dimensional perspective on such profound character dynamics.  Redemption is a process by which the redeemed find enough comfort in whatever they have or whatever they've done that they can keep going again.  But this is not just a film about some men gaining atonement for their guilt.  It is far more than that; it is about survival and hope and I always feel a little sense of salvation myself every single time I watch it.<br /><br />Directed by frequent Stephen King novel interpreter and outstanding screenwriter Frank Darabont ([[ASIN:B000HEWEDU The Green Mile]], [[ASIN:B0010X745K The Mist]]), The Shawshank Redemption is a film that takes place in the late 1940s at Shawshank Prison in Maine.  It follows two prisoners; Ellis Boyd Redding or \\"Red\\" (Morgan Freeman), who has long known of the accountability he has for his crimes and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quirky banker serving two consecutive life sentences for the murder of his wife and another man, crimes he did not commit.  Andy is easy to root for as both an innocent man and a fish out of water.  His ethics, his honesty, and his moral character are crucial elements to a story taking place in a world of such corruption and guilt.  It is beautiful to watch and Robbins is so compelling.  Freeman truly becomes the redeemed and in the end he can only find his sense of hope and freedom in the ways that an innocent man, perhaps unwittingly, inspired him.<br /><br />This was actually not a huge hit in theaters and I didn't even see it until about three or four years after its initial release in 1994.  It was nominated for seven Oscars but was overlooked due to Forrest Gump, a film I can do without.  All of sudden it seems everyone is coming out of the woodwork to hail the Shawshank Redemption as one of the greatest films of all time.  It is hard to see any film from the last twenty years or so on lists next to [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane]] or [[ASIN:B0001NBNB6 The Godfather]], but I can't say it troubles me to see this particular film get so much credit.  The movie is emotionally powerful enough that it almost feels like a relative or an old familiar friend up there getting a round of applause and all the credit in the world.

1845767055|5.0|As a long time fan of fantasy artists I was struck by the detailed art of Mr. Bonner. I was aware of his work from Warhammer and other gaming lines but this is a excellent showpiece of his ability to bring both whimsy and talent to a crowded genre.
B000NQPZCO|2.0|I did not realize there is such a difference in DVD's. I ordered the worng one and had to send it back.
B000WGWQG8|4.0|One episode short of the conclusion, I'm very engrossed and have enjoyed and appreciated the work.  I intended to drop HBO, but I'm holding on until this series is over.  Yes, I'm a poor slob who knows nothing about the \\"Dutch Angle\\", and other things, but I do enjoy a good story about our history.  This one has holes, but such as it is when one is condensing such a lengthy life to eight or so short hours.    In sum, nice job.  I'll renew my HBO subscription when you do another series on Mr. Jefferson, (hopefully) again played by the fascinatingly nuanced Mr. Dillane.

He is one of the best British actors of his era and many to come. I mean he can play any part, that is need to be done. A interesting side note the actor playing sunday the preacher is from Wilton, ct, which is not that far from me. So keep on making great movie, but try to do them with Lewis always.

0786555394|5.0|This book will either take you by storm or you will not even understand the first page and throw it away with your quick defense mechanism as it discusses \\"unpleasant\\" things like life and death in our ateist society, \\"not PC concepts\\" like unifying force, infinite intelligence, source etc.     I would say that the scientist will in 95% of the cases throw it away as crap because he is usually very uninformed(because of his well developed logical thinking from all the school books he read and accepted as \\"truth\\") and willing to accept anything that is not scientifically measured.     Since being a scientist with a thorough knowledge of phsyics and maths I have come to the conslusion that we completely have lost our grip of science and physics in the \\"Post Einstein\\" era. Sad to see but Tesla was right: \\"The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly, one must be sane to think clearly.\\"     However, if you are interested in knowing why some people overperform(geniuses) in life whilst others only complain about their misery, then this book can enlighten you.     Probably, if you are under 40 with no setbacks in life this book will end up in the garbage can in just about 2 minutes.     To me his book summarizes the wisdom of many other books I have read, the difference is that Tolle does it better and more clearly than others. The book needs at least 3 readings to get a grip of the material.      To anyone who wishes to \\"get to the next level\\" of poise, wisdom, acceptance and happiness I recommend this book. The results will come without \\"effort\\".

B00005NKK8|5.0|The soundtrack to the movie Forrest Gump gives us an excellent assortment of American hits that cannot be ignored; they're all THAT good. The quality of the sound is excellent; and the artwork is very tastefully done.<br /><br />The track set starts off with none other than Elvis Presley singing and belting out his famous number, \\"Hound Dog.\\" The guitar work and drums work well; but Elvis' voice carries this number and the backup vocalists are great! \\"(I Don't Know Why) But I Do\\" by Clarence 'Frogman' Henry registers huge on this scale; this gets the royal treatment and it fits perfectly with so much of the other music on this album. Similarly \\"Walk Right In\\" by The Rooftop Singers has an infectiously happy melody to it; and this is an excellent example of 1960s folk music. Moreover, \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" by Joan Baez sparkles as if it were still fresh and new today--it's that much of a classic. Excellent!<br /><br />\\"I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)\\" features The Four Tops singing their hearts out; and it all works very well. \\"Respect by Aretha Franklin is easily one of my favorites on this two CD set; it's awesome and it's easily a major highlight of this two CD set.<br /><br />\\"California Dreamin',\\" of course, features The Mamas and The Papas; this song inspired so many young people in the 1960s to journey to California in search of inner peace and a better quality of life. \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" is equally bright when Simon & Garfunkel sing it; they harmonize perfectly and their guitar work is mighty fine!<br /><br />\\"San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Some Flowers In Your Hair)\\" by Scott Mackenzie really sounds great as it ever did; Scott's melody is really very pretty and I enjoy this number very much.  \\"Aquarius\\" and \\"Let The Sun Shine In\\" by The Fifth Dimension are hauntingly beautiful and instantly memorable, too.<br /><br />\\"Joy To The World\\" is a number by Three Dog Night that really strikes me as very passionate; and listen for \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.\\" B. J. Thomas sings this passionately with great sensitivity; and it's one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard! What a great soundtrack this is! \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" by Lynyrd Skynyrd really rocks well with a fine country twist; Lynyrd Skynyrd could really rock out a tune!<br /><br />\\"I've Got To Use My Imagination\\" is a fiery ballad by Gladys Knight & the Pips that really tugs at my heartstrings whenever I hear it; and there's also \\"On The Road Again\\" by Willie Nelson.<br /><br />Overall, the soundtrack to Forrest Gump gives us so much Americana music it's hard to ignore this two CD set.

B000V86OKG|5.0|So glad that Amazon has finally indicated that the 2nd season is on it's way!  I went ahead a pre-ordered it to lock in the price and any discounts that may follow.    I did a lengthy review of S1, so I won't do the same for this one. I will give major props to the writers and the actors for not falling into that sophomore slump that plagues so many shows. The acting was tight, the plots believable (I mean come on, we ARE talking about a serial killer) and the character development continued.  I'm not sure why people (not necessarily on Amazon) are so opposed to Dex developing as a character. He's experienced a lot over the last couple of seasons and lots of things he believed at his core were challenged by new information and new things he discovered about himself.  I think it would be outlandish to believe that this show could be so successful if viewers couldn't empathize with Dex. If he just went around killing people every episode with nothing to balance that out, I doubt people would stay interested.  Plus, by his own words, his relationship with Deb, Rita and the kids, and his bonds at the station keep him from falling into total darkness. The writers do a great job of proving that point.    Also, people keep stressing that Dexter is \\"emotionless.\\" Well, I'm no expert, but I can recognize rage when I see it, so he's not emotionless. Harry conditioned him to believe he was.  That's what I find so interesting about this show. The code of Harry is crumbling around him and he can't process what he feels or how he reacts.    The only thing about the season that I could have done w/o was the infamous British Invasion. She got on my nerves.  Her character (and the acting) stunk it up w/the exaggerated accent, the over the top nakedness, and her overall presence. So annoying the way she slithered into every single area of his life, and she was a plot device, but she served her purpose in helping Dexter realize some things about himself.  So on that front, she was necessary.    Dexter's ending monologue has me geared up for Season 3.      BTW, the point has been made that the writers took Season 2 into their own creative hands, so while Season 1 was pretty faithful to the first book, Season 2 doesn't continue to the second novel.  I have read this in interviews and in podcasts.  So if you're a purist (not being derogatory) in that way, you probably will be disappointed.
1580176941|5.0|I have always enjoyed making decorated sugar cookies at Christmastime, but they were never that great. The cookies themselves were only okay, my frostings always smooshed down and I never knew what to do with the actual decorations, I was a woman with cute cookie-cutters, but without a plan. This is the book that changed all that.     I've now made the plain butter (with the tasty lemon zest) and the chocolate butter cookies serveral times and have yet to be dissapointed. There were a few tricks about rolling out the dough and when and for how long to chill the dough that were worth the price of the book alone. From the cookie recipes themselves to the royal icing and flooding techniques to how to get the decorating sugars to stick, the book is well written, FULL of great pictures for ideas for all occasions and explanations for techniques that I thought I knew, but didn't.     I love this book, it brought my decorated cookies to the next level and I couldn't be more pleased. After reading through this book I went out and increased my cookie cutter collection and can hardly wait to make even more! This book has a place of honor in my kitchen and I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind taking a little time (decorating cookies is time consumming no matter who's recipes you're using)to make a truly stunning result.

0684865130|5.0|Catch- 22 is a hilariously genius novel written by bestseller novelist Joseph Heller. The plot takes place in the heat of World War II on the small island of Pianosa, which is eight miles south of Elba. It follows the journey of an American bomber Yossarian, who is encroaching upon the first of his middle-aged years. The story introduces a myriad of characters that very much influence and have the ability to control the fate of the many bombers including Yossarian. In an attempt to escape this unappealing and rather petrifying fate, which is known to be Yossarian's \\"journey\\", the protagonist matures as a character that will eventually escape a catch-22 with the last sentence.      The novel, which was filled with irony, spoke brutally honest words, which in different circumstances would have been considered taboo. \\"...A world boiling in chaos in which everything was in proper order\\" (154) is one of many instances where Heller's ability to successfully bring together two words of opposite meaning is displayed. Joseph Heller is a literary genius whose novel will never age with time.

More than a class in cultures, this book will teach you about human strengh, emotional bonding and the futulity of rationalizing all of life's challenges when all you can really do is live another day.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I found there to be quite a difference between Ratatouille and the last Disney DVD I reviewed, \\"Meet the Robinsons.\\" While they were both very good, \\"Meet the Robinsons\\" was a bit more cerebral and I thought its concepts of time travel may have been a bit much for younger kids to grasp. On the other hand, Ratatouille is a true screwball comedy, almost more in the spirit of old Warner Brothers Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny cartoons. It's a pure slapstick farce, and kids will have no problem laughing their heads off here.<br /><br />Comedian Patton Oswalt shines in the lead role as Remy, a rat with an acute sense of smell and a taste for fine food. When Remy and his clan are ran out of their previous home, Remy ends up in downtown Paris at the restaurant of recently deceased chef Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett). Gusteau's will calls for his restaurant to go to a family heir and if none are found, it passes to the head chef, Skinner. Of course, he does have an unknown heir working right in the restaurant. Linguini (Lou Romano) is a shy young man without the slightest bit of skills in the kitchen. That all changes when he meets Remy who hides under Linguini's hat and controls his movements to create dishes that thrill the customers at Gusteau's and rankle Skinner who is determined to find out his secrets. Gusteau's spirit visits Remy, providing sage advice along the way.<br /><br />While Linguini is learning skills from chef Colette (Janeane Garofalo), Remy runs into conflict with his father Django (Brian Dennehy) who shows in rather graphic fashion, what happens when rats get too close to humans. He wants Remy to return to the clan but Remy is determined to help Linguini win the restaurant from the evil Skinner. Peter O' Toole almost steals the film near the end playing a food critic named Anton Ego who is the scourge of fine dining. His column can make or break a restaurant. And now Linguini has to cook for him without a staff and without Remy.<br /><br />No offense to Patton Oswalt, but he was born to voice a rat. His light, enthusiastic voice was the perfect match for Remy. I laughed out loud several times when Remy was under Linguini's hat and pulling his hair to drive him like a horse. There's also a great scene when the Health Inspector walks into the kitchen to see hundreds of rats scurrying about, preparing dinner. Peter Sohn as Remy's brother Emile provided further comic relief as a fattened rat who never saw a piece of trash he wouldn't eat. All of the voice talent...even the usually annoying Garofalo...turned in strong performances. The only curious scene involved Skinner trying to get Linguini to talk by getting him drunk on wine. That's an odd scene for a Disney who normally likes to avoid the remotest chance of controversy.<br /><br />There are two weaknesses to the film and DVD. First, at 1 hour and 51 minutes, it's probably too long by about 15 minutes I think. It's hard to keep the interest of young kids for close to two hours. Secondly, the special features on the DVD were light. There is a 13 minute interview with the writer and producer, three deleted scenes, an instruction with Remy on rats as your friend, and a short animated film called \\"Lifted\\". A bit skimpy for a Disney DVD.born to voice a rat. His light, enthusiastic voice was the perfect match for Remy.

0312995423|5.0|Well I had heard a lot about The Davinci code so I decided that I would check Dan Brown out.  The first book I read from him was Digital Fortress and I absolutely loved it!  It had a great story line with plenty of twists and turns.  I also like Brown's chapters.  They are short and always leave you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen.  Really hard book to put down.  Loved it and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good read.  Probably my favorite Dan Brown book (of the four)
0743298039|5.0|I had some extra time this weekend so I started \\"The Thirteenth Tale.\\" Twenty hours later I got up from my couch. I'm not sure I've ever read a book of this length over the course of one day! Wow... to call this a page turner is a fair statement. This is not a flawless novel by any means -- the comparisons to classics like \\"Rebecca\\" are hyperbolic-- but it's tightly plotted with major payoffs after 405 pages. There are twists at the end that work, and a few that brought tears to my eyes. And then there is that enigmatic final line. I'll need to re-read the book before I decide what it meant.<br /><br />There are plenty of weird moments in this book, and not every development held my interest as much as the main ones. But this is worth a read and provides all the things it promises.
038572179X|2.0|So this is one of those books that you pick up only coz it has tons of reviews and everyone you know is reading it and there's a movie on it, so it must be good right?  Welll it is an interesting theme but at the end of it the only image of Briony that I had was of a silly brat and not the complicated child prodigy that the author beings to paint her as. I did enjoy reading the book but only because the author does a good job of eloquently beating around the bush and making you believe the story is about to get fiercely dramatic...that never happens. The story wraps up much too quickly in a few pages for all the time you've spent tracking these people's lives. Overall the book's an easy, fast read so go ahead but do not set high expectations.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Braveheart is one of my favorite films of the 90's but I had never purchased it on DVD because the original release was so skimpy in terms of extras. It had only a commentary track and a 30-minute making of feature. Paramount has finally beefed up the DVD with a two-disc set featuring several new extras. While it is not overflowing, it's light years better than the original release.<br /><br />The film tells the story of 13th century Scottish patriot and rebel, William Wallace (Gibson) who unites the various clans of Scotland to fight for their freedom against the English. England had used the turmoil of the previous Scottish king's death to gain a stronger foothold in the country. When an English Sheriff makes an example of Wallace's love, Murron, by slitting her throat, Wallace leads a bloody revolt on the local garrison and exacts his revenge on the local magistrate.<br /><br />Wallace becomes the inspirational leader of the Scots, even though others have a greater claim to the Scottish throne, such as Robert the Bruce. Wallace leads his men on various guerilla raids against the English, culminating in one of the bloodiest battles ever filmed. Heads and limbs are severed, skulls are crushed, and arrows pierce throats. Rarely had the carnage of battle been so accurately and beautifully shot.<br /><br />In many ways, Braveheart was like one of those grand Hollywood epics of the 50's and 60's like Spartacus or Ben-Hur. Outstanding performances and sweeping landscapes punctuate the film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Say what you want about Gibson's politics and opinions on ethnic groups...he' still one hell of a filmmaker.<br /><br />Certainly the film took liberties with history but even the real Wallace's life is shrouded in mystery and much of it comes from a poet who wrote the tales over a hundred years after Wallace's Death. As good as Gibson was in the lead role, my favorite performance was Patrick McGoohan as King Edward I. McGoohan's crusty and callous portrayal cut an intimidating figure onscreen. He cannot contain his disdain for his homosexual son and in one memorable scene, tosses his son's lover out a window to his death. This is an outstanding film that holds up view after view.<br /><br />Now...as to the extras...<br /><br />The Gibson commentary is back on this new DVD and is insightful because you're not only getting commentary of the lead actor, but also of the Director and Producer as well as Gibson wore all three hats.<br /><br />The original DVD had a 30-minute making of Documentary. The new disc has a 49-minute making of documentary. Having not seen the original, I don't know if any of the material is repeated, but the new documentary has comments from Gibson both currently and from 1995 and he shares the fact that he originally passed on doing the film.<br /><br />\\"A Writer's Journey\\" is a 21:30 featurette about the writing of the story by Randall Wallace.<br /><br />\\"Tales of William Wallace\\" is a 30 minute documentary about the true William Wallace with comments from various historians.<br /><br />There is also a 14:30 featurette with interviews with the cast members done back while the film was shooting.<br /><br />All in all, Paramount has finally given Braveheart fans a DVD release that is worthy of the film.imidating figure onscreen.

0780021967|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie since this Criterion dvd is rather costly and a rerelease with a flawless screening seemed like the perfect way to be introduced to this so-called Hitchcock classic. It's a real shame the film ends up being so damn twee.<br /><br />The main problem is that the film is just too quaint. None of the bad guys feel like a real threat and are frequently fooled by Hanney's simple tricks, the stakes aren't exactly high and the MacGuffin is surely Hitchcock's lamest. The final scene in which a memory man (a pre-USB key device) recites a vital formula to no one of importance before dying is a dumb way to end the film. I was expecting some gripping set-piece like at the end of North By Northwest or Saboteur when the hero and villain went head to head at Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty. But a single shot fired at the London Palladium? Come on!<br /><br />And what's the deal with that silly chase sequence over the moors of Scotland. The stupid speeded-up footage makes it look like a Benny Hill skit sans music. Plus there absolutely aint no atmosphere to speak of. The only thing that really amused me was the chemistry between Hannay and Pamela, but that came too late in the movie.<br /><br />They also changed too much from the book. Pretty much all that's left is the name Richard Hannay and the words 'the 39 steps'. Take away those and it's something completely different from John Buchan's book.<br /><br />A true adaptation would have been much better.

0385512058|2.0|More than anything else, this book is a biography of the author. I estimate that about 70% of the material is stories of his life. After that, this book serves as sales material for the author's consulting business. Third it is a self congradulation. Fourth it is about high-brow, high-end networking. It is not a how to book on getting people to like you so you will never have to eat alone. The title, while clever, has very little to do with the content and is never mentioned. There are some good tips on networking, but most tend to be advanced and assume you have a wonderful network. I'm sure those networking tips are useful to some people, but I bet the vast majority of people who get this book will never use any. There is very very little specific tips on the act of talking with people. Some of the author's assertions are clearly false and I felt like much of what he wrote about he has little experience in doing--he just put it down as a good networking idea and pulled together enough material to flesh it out. There is some good information here, but it could have been condinced into about 20 pages. Most people who start this book will quit with exhaustion. I only finished because I listened to the audio book.

0452289963|2.0|First, I'll just say that I am a Christian, and my main curiosity with this juggernaut bestseller was, as according to Oprah and many others who have reviewed the book, whether or not Tolle's message lines up with my belief system. Second, I'll say that I think I am reasonably open-minded. In other words, I am not the type of person who only believes some \\"worth\\" can be gained from a thing (e.g. a book, film or philosophy) if that artistic creation is intrinsically \\"Christian\\" or \\"biblical\\". For example, I love film--my favorite film of the past year was There Will Be Blood, which, though spiritual, did not exactly take a kind view of the Christian church.<br /><br />I thought Tolle's soothing style was peace-inducing and at times, very helpful. And while I wholeheartedly agree with him that we must die to our own self-interested ego and reach a place of deeper, more selfless consciousness, I do respectfully disagree as to the source or headwaters from which that peace flows.<br /><br />In other words, it seems to me and my reading of his book that he is asserting that the \\"higher self\\" is found within. I don't believe that. I think thousands of years of human evil have proven that if left to our own \\"higher selves,\\" war, violence, and chaos is the typical outcome. Even religion can't provide that--the Crusades and Inquisition are good examples of how religion, void of the real Christ, can be manipulated by humankind. Ultimately, for me, true peace, deliverance, and joy comes from a place outside myself--in the person of Christ. Christ was not born in my heart. He was not crucified in my soul. He did not rise from the dead in my consciousness. His payment was made FOR my heart, FOR my soul, and FOR my consciousness. Outside of myself, not inside. That's perhaps splitting hairs for some, but a fundamental, critical differentiation for me and my understanding of the source of TRUE joy, tranquility and peace. To put it simply: My salvation comes from \\"outside myself\\" and into my life, via Christ's miracle of salvation.<br /><br />For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with those who claim that A NEW EARTH is compatible with Christianity. I don't believe it is. Ultimately, the Christ I have come to understand is asking us to die to ourselves, and allow Him to be the Captain of our ship. At best, our mind/spirit/soul/consciousness is First Mate, but certainly not sitting in the skipper's chair.<br /><br />For Christians, I think Tolle's book has some nice things for extraction, but as a guiding life philosophy? No, not even close.via Christ's miracle of salvation.    For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with those who claim that A NEW EARTH is compatible with Christianity. I don't believe it is.

0307265730|3.0|I don't want to criticize Jhumpa for always choosing the same milieu and the same class of Ivy League privileged Bengali families in the US. It's all well known and she doesn't try to deny it. But what seems most disappointing about her writing is that we have the impression she is constantly recycling the same characters, who although sometimes flawed, always seem somewhat too well planned out and not real enough.  They want to live beyond the constraints of their cultural up-bringing, but they never really expand their experience beyond occasionally marrying an American. The short story that stood out the most for me was \\"Nobody's business\\" where the author finally strays from the usual plot; that of a mixed marriage, but the plot still seems to dance around marriage and education.<br />Ms Lahiri's writing is mostly quite pleasant, skilled and at times a brilliantly put together prose, yet it lacks luster or humor. The characters, like the story lines are always on the verge of exploding, on the verge of something meaningful happing to them, yet they always stop short and the endings inevitably seem underwhelming.<br />The emotions that she tries so hard to elicit in the reader feel contrived.  Having read numerous comparisons to Alice Munro, I was expecting much more, but if you are looking for an enjoyable read on the plane, I'd whole heartedly recommend it.

His cover of Eric Clapton's, \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" was not my cup of tea. If I could give Michael Buble a piece of advice, it would be for him to release of cd of his own original music.

0553378384|4.0|If you've ever wanted to learn just what a \\"North Node\\" means in an astrological chart and what it can do for you, this is the book for you!  This astrological discusses what each North Node position means in great detail and she does not mince words about the negative traits associated with any position.  (My North Node is in Libra, and she had a lot of choice things to say about those of us with this position.)    I will be checking to see if she has any more books available.  I'd like to see what she has to say about other astrology-related topics.

1596912855|4.0|Jane Hayes has a serious problem. And that problem is an obsession -- an obsession with Mr. Darcy, the immortal hero of Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.    When a well-off great-aunt gives Jane a vacation to a Regency-era resort in England, Jane hopes she can finally overcome this obsession of hers. But as she finds herself dressed to the nines in time period apparel and flirting in true Austen fashion with the ever-charming male actors, fantasy and reality blend together until the two are indistinguishable.    This novel, while at times a little unbelievable, was wholly enjoyable and amusing. Not lacking in wit or intelligence, AUSTENLAND is a carefree and lighthearted story that will delight even the most die-hard Austen fans.
0060832819|1.0|Even though it would be the last sentence of the review, i'll share the last in the very first. This is the first book i've read written by Coelho and i reckon that it'll be the last one as well. It doesn't mean the book itself is utterly hollow, there are some parts which make you ponder on some certain subjects nevertheless it's full of chiche,contradictions and repeat therein which really bores.
0143038419|2.0|I read most of the reviews about this book, saw the author on TV, listen to my friends rave about it...but honestly it wasn't very good. It took me ages to get through and I found for the first time in my life skipping pages in order to finish it (or get over the really boring, overly wordy, insignificant parts)!!! I would not recommend the book...
0143038419|3.0|I like books that are collections of true life experiences, I was bored with this I just couldnt get into the stories. I really enjoyed Mr Instability by Tom Elsa its was a laugh out loud book with excellent true stories. Oh well off too read the next one!
B000002H33|5.0|\\"Master\\" was supposed to be a birthday gift from my girlfriend who had previously told me that she didn't like Metallica. Well she and some friends had been to Salt Lake City and my gf (ex) got this album while they were there and for some reason they decided to listen to it on the way back to Pocatello. I found this disconcerting especially since she didn't even have the courtesy to rewind the cassette before giving it to me. I had to ask. She and her friends LOVED it! I let it go since I was jonesing to listen to this new Metallica album. I was melted butter after listening to the first 2 songs. After that I was on a tropical Metallica island and all was good.<br />Master of Puppets is so good that \\"anyone\\" would have a difficult time dismissing its alluring power and awe. If you like Country, Rap, R&B, Disco, Pop, Classical, etc... you would be selling yourself short if you don't have this album in your musical collection. A true masterpiece.<br />Angryj
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in years. Funeral funny? That seems to be an oxymoron of the worst type. Yet this one out does itself at every turn. Serious son Daniel (Matthew MacFadyen) and  Jane (his real life wife Keeley Hawes) are helping host the  funeral at the family home (from which they both wish to escape to a flat of their own, once dad has a proper send off.) Dad definitely gets a send off but not quite the one they'd hoped for. With a crazy cast of relatives not all of whom get along; the wrong body; a famous brother and favorite son- whose only goal is chatting up a cute girl; a stray bottle of \\"Valium\\" that keeps turning up at inopportune times; a dwarf with a  big secret; and a coffin with a mind of its own- it's the recipe for disaster. The supporting cast are all people you will recognize but may not know their names. With a lesser cast this might have turned into a very different movie. But all of the players are top notch, blessed with  perfect timing and directed with a deft hand by Frank Oz. It reminds me a bit of Young Frankenstein. When it first came out, few of the actors were well known but became famous from this iconic classic. I feel sure the same will happen here with the DVD release. Though able to easily stand on its own, word of mouth will give this show legs.  The price of the DVD is well worth it just for the hilarious gag reel that is included. I highly recommend it.
B000001Y5D|4.0|I enjoy the sound of this band.  Admire Linda Perry as a brilliant singer and song writer.  For me, it's a good cd. And I think it's a pity that the band only recorded one cd.
B00005V0X5|5.0|The same dear friend who gave me a listen to Exodus' Force of Habit also played this album for me when it first came out back in the mid- 80's and I thought it was pretty dang good. He really liked it and since he kept playing it I started to feed off his vibe and I knew then that \\"The Business of Killing\\" was much better than pretty dang good, it was 'Great'\\". The only flaw was that Mustaine's vocals were 'too speed' for the music and songs. Over the years he's since got his vocals timing down for his true skull crushing speed metal tunes, yet his supreme axe skills still remain to be much faster than he can sing. Oh well. For me its just the way he punishes the listener with his music when he really wants to, and on \\"Killing...\\" he does it with deathly precision! This album is pure speed sugar and with the song \\"These boots\\" it gets a well deserved 5 stars. I dare anyone to watch the Nancy Sinatra version of this song not to want to listen to this album. Just you try it and see for yourself!<br />Angryj
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Dark, dreery, seedy, gritty.  Van Halen, the Beach Boys of metal, put aside their crotch rock tendencies to make an album about the underbelly of society (if you'll pardon the cliche.)  Eddie Van Halen's guitar work is nothing short of mindblowing and fits the feel of stories David Lee Roth spins (of porn actresses, adulterous paramours, sinners in general.)<br /><br />Legend has it that Eddie was miserable and considering quitting the group when Fair Warning was recorded.  In true blues master fashion, he channeled all his angst into the music and it sounds the way one would imagine he probably felt.<br /><br />Fair Warning is great.  Even at just a shade over half an hour, it's loaded with a lot of guts and feel.  No incarnation of Van Halen ever recorded a better album. It's a hard rock mammoth, one of the best albums in its genre ever released.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Werner Herzog's 1979 german remake of  the F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic silent-horror epic masterpiece, is also the most gothic, cruel, lavish and intensely dark and creepy revision of the classic novel of Bram Stoker. Klaus Kinski's arrogant, sickly, and tubercular looks gives life to a Nosferatu that tracends the limits of disturbing charisma and maniac-agressiveness, turning the infamous classic character into an  eerie and sympathetic vampire, consumed with sadness and melancholy  and corroded by the terrible curse of inmortality. Turned into a self-aware ghoulish and almost spectral vision, his pain over his own malediction  is shown in such a dramatic fiber in the film, a tangible reality of shame and fear: hidding behind his long nails, the facial expressions of Kinki's Nosferatu reflects a whole world of suffering and affliction never acomplished before, and never matched until today. A pain that the monster wants to inflict back to humanity for the decaying life-in-death curse that's  devouring his agonizing existence. In the present days, the mythology, the sense and deepness of the curse of vampirism, the sadness and loneliness of the ghoul are almost dissapeared, giving total space and importance to the horror imagery and graphic aesthetics of the  colosal strenght of the night creature made of fangs, wings and the lust of the insatiable blood-thirst, regardless of the monster's condition of victim or devoted killer.<br /><br />This masterpiece in horror cinema and artistic quality gem, was the last great raw portrayal of the real  and hellish myth of the vampire within the cursed character. Without spilling a single drop of blood and exclusively based on costumes with no special effects, and not being excessively scary but dramatic, this dark and atmospheric universe is so intense and creepy, that it invades our very primal fears, thanks to the awesome performance of the disturbing Kinski and a haunting, electronic and  powerful score that turns the ambient into an actual nightmare. Another factor worth mention is the innocent and luminous aura of the often  under-written character of Lucy, played by a young and beautiful Isabelle Adjani, as the perfect counter for the nasty and opaque count.<br /><br />Herzog's Nosferatu is still an evil dark force who terrorizes a small german village with diabolic cruelty in the form of a plague that can't be forgiven, but we can't help to feel sorry for this lost and derranged remain of a soul. The surrealist creepiness of the plague itself, with wandering sheep and goats in the town square, and the aesthetics of the vampire based on the original B&W silent classic, turn this movie into a must see for fans of gothic horror, nightmare ambients, and extremely disturbing characters.<br /><br />This is one of the best accomplished and most deep and artistical vampire movies ever made, and one of the most succesful colaborations between Werner Hezrog and Klaus Kinski, after the monumental epic drama \\"Aguirre, the wrath of god\\", another masterful portrayal of madness and lost humanity. Few movies at the time had the courage to let aside the bloody and expected violence of the vampire as a hidden monster behind a gentleman's cape and fine charms, to focus with such visceral greatness and deepness in the exploration of the creature as a true, honest, unique and evil \\"whole\\". This unique and final landmark in horror filmaking destroyed and buried the previous collective \\"vintage\\" imagery and feel of the Christopher Lee-like standard character, those classic movies seemed like children's fairytales compared to this monument of cold fear.<br /><br />A truly outstanding masterpiece that you can find in this great DVD edition, wich contains the two known  versions: English dubbed, that loses a bit of agresiveness but has better sound quality , and the original German version with 11 extra minutes and definetly the choice to behold. This gothic and ancient-looks work of art deserves to be considered a classic not only in horror, but in cinema in general.rror, but in cinema in general.
0307387178|4.0|After Chris McCandless starved to death in the Alaskan wilderness, many Alaskan oldtimers referred to McCandless's attempt to live off the land as amateurish if not down-right stupid. His rifle wasn't big enough to bring down big game, he did not know how to preserve meat, and he relied on a field guild to determine which plants were safe to eat.<br /><br /> Jon Krakauer spends most of the book trying to rehabilitate McCandless's memory. He argues that not even veteran bush adventurers would have survived as long as McCandless did, that it was just bad luck that he died. He then sites his own experience trying to climb Alaska's Devil's Thumb, during which time he walked across a glacier with hidden crevasses, his only protection a ten-foot span of curtain-rod-like metal tied to his shoulders. According to Krakauer, his survival was only a matter of luck.<br /><br /> INTO THE WILD began as a magazine article. Krakauer doesn't really have enough material for a full-length book, so after showing us what led to McCandless's attempt to explore Stampede Trail, he compares Candles' ill-conceived adventure to that of other wilderness enthusiasts such as Henry David Thoreau, John Muir, and Everett Reuss who disappeared into southern Utah's Davis Gulch at the age of twenty. Reuss seemed to court oblivion. Once his burro stirred up a nest of wild bees, and Reuss spent three or four days just getting his eyes open. He also suffered from almost terminal poison ivy.<br /><br /> Although we find out quite early that McCandless did not survive, Krakauer establishes suspense by making us guess what eventually killed the boy. After all, he was only a few miles from an Alaskan highway, and the raging river that blocked his way when he first tried to leave would have been passable later that summer.<br /><br /> Krakauer also delves into McCandless psychological make-up. He didn't get along with his parents, especially his father, who was some kind of NASA genius. He was also incredibly stubborn and idealistic, going so far as to give away what was left of an inheritance after graduating college and burning the money he had left so he could live off the land. That said, he put his money where his mouth was, spending time in Washington DC, trying to feed the homeless. Krakauer was right. Many of are dreamers, but only a few of us try to turn them into reality.g so far as to give away what was left of an inheritance after graduating college and burning the money he had left so he could live off the land.

0553378384|5.0|This wonderful book by Jan Spiller is not new to me.  I consulted its wise pages some years ago when I borrowed it from a friend.

B0010X73ZG|3.0|There aren't enough horror films out there that utilize character development as part of their narrative or at least try to say something whether it's about society or the individual. Fortunately, The Mist makes an attempt, albeit not the best, in trying to examine fear and how it affects people in an enclosed setting. Needless to say it results in the inevitable mob mentality as witnessed in numerous tales (Lord of the Flies, J.J. Abram's \\"Lost\\", etc.) but in this case the antagonists are not from our world. This is a nice touch in that in no way can the audience relate to the creatures in any way. They show no emotion nor any motivation in their killing almost as if they were going about their business as usual. There is a similarity to \\"The Old Ones\\" of H.P. Lovecraft's \\"Cthulhu\\" where he describes their indifference to life around them and even note the monster at the end of the film with tentacles as if a nod to Lovecraft. That being said we are left to focus  not on the creatures but on the struggle inside the supermarket between a growing religious fanaticism amongst the many against the few who hold onto using logic. This alone is enough to garner ten stars from me as this is the stuff that makes classics but unfortunately the third act falls apart rather quickly.     I won't give it away here but when you do see it I wonder if the general public will agree with me in wanting to know why everything had to lead up to this. Why does our lead protagonist David Drayton (Thomas Jane) deserve this? The problem isn't the down ending, which I typically enjoy in films, the problem is simply what does it all mean? What are we left with when the lights go up? That religion was the way to go? Or just wait a little longer and everything will resolve itself so don't fight it? I can't help but think that the ending's sole purpose was shocking for the sake of shock value and nothing else. Which leads to my next question: What is the deal with Stephen King endings anyway? I've read his books and somehow they end just right at least on paper but on the big screen they seem to fall apart (check out IT or The Stand as examples). There's something about the relationship between the reader (their imagination) and the written word and how it can dupe you into buying any convoluted plot. However, on the big screen, the filmmaker has to make his interpretation of said ending work for everyone. He can't force us to accept whether it's right or wrong, it just has to work that one time and that's it. The majority of this film is entertaining, great atmosphere, good character actors and although this film's third act can be chalked up with all the other unsuccessful Stephen King endings the first two acts do make up for it.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|I'm a big Luc Besson fan and have most of his movies.  This one is so very different from his other movies that I was really hesitant in buying it.  But I was totally blown away how good this movie is.  The music is perfect and haunting.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|Although I was under the impression that this item was new, which it wasn't,it was very well-packaged and shipped very fast at a great price. The movie worked fine and didn't seem to be scratched, however, this was going to be a gift for my husband, but it was obviously used so I couldn't wrap it.  Anyway, it was the cheapest price I found, and shipped fast!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I was not familiar with many of the songs when I purchased this soundtrack, but I now love them all! I can't imagine that there could ever be a better cast-- Kristin Chenoweth is absolutely perfect, and surely there couldn't be a better Elphaba than Idina Menzel. The words are included (hurray!) in the little booklet. My only regret is that, having never seen the show, I am still slightly confused about the storyline!

0062515675|4.0|With due respect to Eckhart Tolle and the inimitable Oprah, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari is every bit as awakened and a lot more fun to read than A New Earth which is getting such \\"press.\\" In The Monk Who Sold, the teller of the story, the main character and the reader embark on the same journey at the same time and so the story has an immediacy akin to a spiritual event. Not at all pedantic and yet thought-provoking, the Monk Who Sold His Ferrari teaches non-demominational wisdom that's accessible and timely.
0385338082|5.0|This is the first Sophie Kinsella book I read and I loved it! It made me want to read all of her other books.  She is now my favorite author.   Sophie's characters all seem a little like me and tend to have the worst luck or get themselves into trouble.  Emma is no exception.  I can't imagine telling all my secrets to a complete stranger when I think I am about to die only to find out he is the boss.  Great book if you love chick lit!
B000QJBNDI|5.0|Mastering the Art of French Cooking is a two-volume French cookbook written by the American Julia Child and the Frenchwomen Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle for the American market and published by Knopf in 1961 (Volume 1) and 1970 (Volume 2).<br /><br />The book was the result of a collaboration among the three authors and the impetus for Child's long and successful career as one of the pioneering television chefs. Originally published in 1961 after some early difficulties (which are recounted in great detail in Julia Child's memoirs My Life in France), Mastering volume 1 (ISBN 0-375-41340-5) was a broad survey of French flavors and techniques, and grew out of the work the three women had done for their Paris cooking school, \\"L'&eacute;cole des trois gourmandes\\" (whose logo Child wore as a badge throughout the production of her first TV series, The French Chef); volume 2 (ISBN 0-394-40152-2), released in 1970, expanded on certain topics of interest that had not been covered as completely as the three had planned to in the first volume. Taken together, the two volumes are considered one of the most influential works in American cookbook history, and Child in particular has long been accorded near-universal respect in the cooking world, in part due to these books' influence.<br /><br />Volume 1 covers the basics of French cooking, striking as much of a balance as possible between the complexities of restaurant cooking a l'Escoffier and the practicalities of the American home cook. Traditional favorites like boeuf bourguignon, bouillabaisse, and cassoulet are featured, as are extensive instructions on how to prepare vegetables in a manner more appetizing than the practices of the American kitchen of the 1960s. This volume has been through many printings and has been reissued twice with revisions, first in 1983 with updates for changes in kitchen practice (especially the food processor), and then in 2003 as a 40th anniversary edition with an introduction giving a history of the book.<br /><br />Some classic French baking is also included, but baking got a much more thorough treatment in Volume 2, which was published in 1970 after Bertholle had gone on to other projects. Also covered is breadmaking, which Child and Beck studied under Professor Raymond Calvel, at the time one of France's recognized experts on bread, and charcuterie. -- from wikipediaSome classic French baking is also included, but baking got a much more thorough treatment in Volume 2, which was published in 1970 after Bertholle had gone on to other projects.

B00133KFGW|5.0|Don't listen to harsh critics - this movie is a welcome reprieve from the violence and vulgarity which has saturated today's movie offerings.  I loved it!
1592332803|5.0|I bought this book almost as soon as it hit the shelves last fall. At the time, I didn't know anything about Colleen, her activism, her podcast, her website, etc. I just saw it at the bookstore & thought it was beautiful. The layout is so convenient, the pictures are gorgeous, and the instructions are easy-to-follow. I have been using this book quite often ever since buying it 6 months ago.<br /><br />I have never made a recipe from \\"The Joy of Vegan Baking\\" that didn't turn out perfectly. A few of my favorites are: Butterscotch Pudding, Chocolate Chip Cookies, Date & Almond Butter Smoothie, Mexican Wedding Cookies, Focaccia (best bread I've ever had!), Soft Pretzels, Hot Chocolate, and the Light Lemon Bundt Cake with Lemon Sauce (I take the liberty of adding blueberries to this one). I always get rave reviews--all from my omnivore friends & family!<br /><br />One feature that I really like in this book are the \\"Food Lore\\" snippets placed on some recipe pages. Here, Colleen explains the history of the dish, or shares an interesting factoid about it. I was also pleasantly surprised to see that the recipes included in the book aren't ALL baked goods; smoothies, teas, puddings, and others are also present. Additionally--and this might be my favorite part, besides the actual recipes themselves--the Index is the most comprehensive & convenient I've ever seen! There are THREE indices: one general, one by season, and one by holiday/occasion. Even in the general index, the recipes are sorted by name, type, and ingredient... So if you have cinnamon (for instance) & want to see what you can make, see \\"Cinnamon\\" in the index & all recipes that use this as a primary (or secondary) ingredient will be listed. Same goes for peanut butter, chocolate, pumpkin, nutmeg, etc. It's fantastic!<br /><br />I love that this book seems to be made with EVERYONE in mind: meat- and dairy-eaters, as well as the veg crowd. Some vegan cookbooks have recipes that I personally find delicious, but Ican willingly admit that they are a little too \\"crunchy granola\\" or \\"earthy tasting\\" for most to whole-heartedly enjoy. Not so in this book!<br /><br />Also worth noting... Some people think \\"vegan\\" = \\"health food,\\" and that misconception has led to some negative reviews for this book. Just by virtue of these recipes being egg- & dairy-free, they're a bit healthier than other [non-veg] desserts. But vegans know how to indulge, too! :) For the most part (there are a few exceptions), the recipes in this book are not lowfat, whole grain, or low-calorie. But they're perfect for special occasions, or for sharing desserts with those picky (or skeptical) eaters in your life. The dishes are so comforting & familiar, and don't taste like the \\"vegan version\\" of an old favorite; they taste just like the egg- and dairy-laden versions, only better & cruelty-free! They're by no means \\"diet food,\\" but traditional desserts aren't meant to be! And if you don't like using white sugar & flour (like me), replace some of it with the healthier alternative of your choosing... The recipes are flexible enough to lend themselves to some tweaking!<br /><br />I also want to say that if you like this book, you'll love the author's podcast. \\"Vegetarian Food for Thought\\" is smart, insightful, supportive and SO INSPIRING! I want to tell everyone I know about it because it's THAT amazing.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend this book--for beginning cooks, advanced chefs, and everyone in-between!
B000002H6C|5.0|I am very picky about production in the music I love to listen to.  When an album/CD 'sounds' good then that adds a lot to the listening experience, for me anyway.  It's the production of the Load albums that keep me going back to them often, and I cut them A LOT of slack for making those songs sound good.  Anyway, the production of ...And Justice For All is certainly a strike against it.  But, if you give this CD a couple of listens, you will realize how great the songs themselves are, and the production challenges seem insignificant.  I would actually go a step further than that, and say that I wouldn't want this CD to 'sound' any other way...it's THAT GREAT!!!  I agree with all who rate this as a must have album.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|When you have really good actors and a clear vision of a story, anything is possible. In this case, this telling of part of the Beowulf saga is entertaining as long as you throw out your purism. What I liked were the action sequences. The casting is exceptional. Through voice and some of the movement, you sense the humanity of real life. (Ray Winstone is sexy enough to make that animation convincing.)  Some of the images are very poetic animation even in some of the horror.<br /><br />However, you have to adjust for the botox look of faces and gestures.  In action, that most famous of unnamed characters, Grendel's mother, is left mostly to our imagination. I hope that Barbie-doll nude in really high heels is meant to be an avatar insulting the intelligence of the characters and not the viewer. Jolie's voice is very immotive and accents exotically. Computers have not reached a point where I want to stop missing real actors, places, elements . . . .<br /><br />As usual, check out the special features for how the movie was made. The actors look like harlequin figures on the set. It must have been an interesting project for them.
B000002HRE|4.0|I really like Reload, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.  This album rocks, and reminds me of a heavier version of AC/DC.  I really like the faster rockers here and prefer them over the more experimental songs.  I'll put them into three catagories.    Favorites: Devil's Dance, Better Than You, Carpe Diem Baby, Wild Things, Prince Charming, and Fixxxer-my personal favorite on Reload(LOVE IT!).    Pretty Good: Fuel, Memory Remains (press skip at the 3:30 mark), Slither, Bad Seed, Attitude.    Okay, but don't do anything for me personally: Unforgiven II, Low Man's Lyric.    This CD has plenty of heavy riffing and is well produced.  I listen to it often.  It took me longer to get into Load, but I like that almost as well now, too.
159562015X|4.0|The strength of this book is really centered in the online test that you get with your purchase of the book. Since, I found the online test to be so useful, I salute this book.    Other reviewers have already made the point, repeatedly, that Marcus Buckingham's book is the better read on the benefit of using one's strengths (I agree). But, the combination of this book, assuming you make use of the online test, and Buckingham's is a powerful one-two punch to drive home the point that leveraging our strengths is important to our success.    Because our society tends to emphasize our weaknesses (including with relentless advertising offering instant cures to our weaknesses), there is much more written about curing our weaknesses.  It is great to see some authors serving up an alternative thought: leverage your strengths. Of course to do so, one first needs to objectively assess one's strengths and this book, and the accompanying online test, is an effective way to do so.

B000H2MTUA|4.0|I though Angela's Ashes was a good memoir of a family during World War II.  My favorite character was Frank because it was fun to see him grow up, and see how he changed over the course of this book.  I thought that Angela did as much as she could to try and get her family through World War II, and I thought she did a good job, considering the help she was receiving.  My least favorite character was Malachy.  Malachy was always drunk, and he would always waste away the family's money.  I felt that he only thought about himself.  Unfortunately, most people who are addicted to drugs only think out for themselves, because all they are thinking of is getting drugs for them.  I would definitely recommend this book, and give it four stars.  I would recommend Angela's Ashes to high school students because it does cover a serious issue and the humor might not be appropriate for younger students.  Overall I think the book is a winner!

The songs are deep and have alot of meaning and feeling because the lead singer puts emotion into the songs.  I recommend this CD to anyone that likes the metal sound it's the new sound for the new generation.  If you ever get a chance to see these five guys perform you will be head banging and maybe even in the pit. Five Finger Death Punch is a great band, I will buy their CD's and support this band anyway I can.  NO MERCY IT IS THE WAY OF THE FIST.    J  Wisconsin

0670018651|2.0|More than a few \\"reviews\\" made me uncomfortable, and suspicious of the motives and methods of the authors, Luca Turin in particular. There are some pointlessly personal, acid and mean spirited one line dismissals of perfumes and their creators throughout. I came away with a very different impression of Turin than I had before, due to this pervasive nastiness. Although there's plenty of good information and description, it gets ugly in there. I felt like I'd had an awkward dinner with someone I'd once respected, during which I watched them get drunk, vicious and gossipy, and left feeling disgusted. On the whole, it made me think less of his work than of the work he trashed. The 2 stars are for the obviously good information and good, entertaining writing, but overall I find it disappointing.
B00000DOZH|5.0|the last good AC/DC album. last one with Bon Scott, who drank too much and ended up drowning in his own sick in 1980
B000XPU5NY|4.0|Probably the most complete concert and great sound quality, but...a little powerless. And, i'm not musician, but do they \\"down\\" the songs? I think they put the songs a few tones lower...and you'll note that. That's trouble me.<br />Well, it's still a god cd and you'll wanna hear it, but have to take this as a warning.
B000PTYPAC|2.0|To quote Mr. Burns, \\"I may not know art, but I know what I hate, and I don't hate this.\\"  And I should, for all intent and purposes, hate Paramore.  Maybe my ire has dulled in my old age, because a younger me would rip this band and call them a generic pop punk scene band, but it's not wholly offensive.  Riot! is a simple album that offers simple pleasures.  It's short, catchy, and easily digestible.  It's like musical McDonald's.  You shouldn't eat it all the time, but every now and then it tastes pretty darn good.         Paramore is led by Hayley Williams, who's really the main of appeal of Paramore.  She's got a very good voice, and she's not afraid to belt out a tune with passion and earnest.  It also doesn't hurt that she's an attractive young lady for all the scene kids to have a crush on.  The band is passable.  They're some decent hooks in there, but really, it's all about Hayley Williams.  This is both good and bad.  She's an appealing front woman with a nice voice and she's very attractive, but her lyrics are straight out of a high school journal and are pretty clichéd and mediocre.  She's only 19 though, so she's writing about what she knows.  Apparently Williams has had a lot of trouble with boys, and the topic dominates her lyrics.  Her lyrics would certainly appeal to her target audience, people in high school or just entering college, but they do nothing for me.  If this band manages to stick around, maybe the lyrics will improve and become more diverse with time.      The singles, predictably, are the best songs on the album.  Misery Business is a pretty strong pop song, CrushCrushCrush is also a nice little song with a decent hook, and That's What You Get is kind of enjoyable.  The rest of the album doesn't quite measure up to the singles though.      Musically, this is labeled as pop-punk, though this is about as punk as my 86-year-old grandma.  I'm a classicist, so when I think of pop-punk I think of the Buzzcocks and The Ramones, and this is certainly not very close to either of those bands.  It's closer to power pop, with its big guitars, hooks, and impassioned vocals.  It's a lot closer to a band like Weezer or even the New Pornographers, though it doesn't even come close to reaching the level of quality of those bands best work.     So Riot! isn't anything special, but I do think Paramore has potential.  With a little more musical creativity and lyrical sophistication, and a little less pro-tools and over compression in their sound, this might actually be a serviceable power pop band.  I just hope they keep things simple and don't try for some sort of overblown Queen tribute like My Chemical Romance or some horrible self conscious stab at greatness like Fall Out Boy.   So this is enjoyable when you want something easy and catchy to just zone out to, but you got to keep your musical diet filled with more substantive stuff as well.  Listen to some Descendents, Buzzcocks, Ramones, or the Misfits for some catchy punk, or the New Pornographers, Weezer, Fountains of Wayne, or Big Star for some power pop.  Trust me, you'll feel more rewarded if you do.

B0011NVC9I|3.0|I love Beowolf as a story. I did find the movie in ways the good at the beginning. I went with the 3D version and the animation in the beginning was awesome. It was impressive. The movies storyline started out awesome. Then it started running long and boring. The story sizzle stopped after the first meeting with Grendall's mother and then went down. The animations stopped popping out a you and the ending bored me to tears because it when on and on.
0525950079|5.0|In \\"World Without End,\\" Kevin Follett has written an entertaining and engrossing historical novel set in 14th century England. It kept me thoroughly involved and wondering what would happen next. I also got something of the flavor of period so I start by saying the book is a success as a historical novel.<br /><br />This well researched historical novel takes on a lot; life in a medieval town, serfs struggling for survival and independence, the lives of monks and nuns along with the tremendous influence of the Church, the nobility, knights, the Plague, witch trials, the roles of women, social inequities between peasants and nobles, corruption, cruelties that seem shocking to us, battles of the Hundred Years War (especially Crecy), the often ignorant and disastrous medical practices of the time and much more.  The plot line takes place over about 35 years during middle 14th century England and follows four main characters from childhood as they attempt to find a place in the world; a boy apprenticed to a builder who reaches new levels in his trade, his brother who becomes a squire and starts the road to knighthood and the nobility, a merchant's daughter with unconventional views and aspirations, and a peasant girl who wants to gain the love of her life. All of them have many trials, setbacks, and triumphs that kept me interested and even personally involved in the lives of these made-up characters. The reader will get a more reasoned and realistic view (while still entertaining) of the time from a non-fiction book such as Barbara Tuchman's, \\"A Distant Mirror\\" or William Manchester's \\"A World Lit Only by Fire.\\" However, as historical fiction, Follett has produced a winner.<br /><br />\\"World Without End\\" is more than a historical novel. It is also melodramatic and like a soap opera at times (in the best sense) with many heroes and villains. Much of the plot lines deals with when and if various couples will get together and find happiness. Love stories full of turns that will delight, dismay, and even annoy the \\"hooked\\" reader. Although far from being \\"great literature, \\"World Without End\\" has something for almost everybody and deserves its high ranking on the bestseller lists.dismay, and even annoy the \\"hooked\\" reader.

1577314808|5.0|About 3-4 years ago, I was in a very difficult period of my life, there was nothing wrong on the surface, family, job, etc. But I was unhappy, until one day I came upon this book which was display in my local bookstore. I was curious... after reading a few pages, I have a little understanding. Until today, this is the only book that I read and reread almost every day. And I have purchased many copies to give to my friends.    Hope you (who is reading this review) will benefit from this book!
006056251X|4.0|I truly enjoyed the story - and I can't help but fall in love with characters who appear in ongoing stories.  However, I would have wished to see more of the St. Vincent seen in the previous stories - he was more charming, sly, and alluring than in his own story.<br /><br />Regardless, it's an enjoyable read as I've found anything written by Kleypas.  Enjoy!
B0014DBZY2|5.0|I heard The Foals one day while searching some upcoming new releases.  I knew these guys were something different.  I was really impressed with the pop and hooks rallied throughout the tracks.  I think this is one of the most energetic records, by far, for 2008.  There is something up The Foals sleeves for sure, but truthfully, there can't be anything more exciting than the way they placed the drop of their beats!  Make it your purchase today....word?!
B0014CQNTK|5.0|Juno was [[ASIN:B000K7VHQE Little Miss Sunshine]] of 2007 - the little independent film that could. Once the studio realized that it had a successful crowd-pleaser on its hands, the film was promoted from the art-house circuit to the multiplexes. Actress Ellen Page and first-time screenwriter Diablo Cody became the film's breakout stars garnering the lion's share of critical raves and awards with Page getting an Independent Spirit Award and Cody an Academy Award. Now that all of the dust has settled, Juno can be reassessed to see if it really has the staying power and substance to cut through all of the hype and stand-up to the inevitable backlash.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody. The first thing that you notice when listening to Cody talking is how well Ellen Page mimicked her way of speaking. Reitman tends to dominate the track and, not surprisingly, talks about filmmaking aspects like the casting of minor roles, the attention to details for the sets, how he shot certain scenes, and so on. This is pretty decent track filled with lots of anecdotal stories and production details.<br /><br />Also included are 11 deleted scenes with optional commentary by Reitman and Cody. We meet Juno's crazy next-door neighbour. There's also a different introduction to Juno's family. We see Mark and Vanessa's first attempt to adopt. There's also an amusing bit where Juno has a solo gig and sings a song about getting pregnant. These are all good scenes and Reitman explains why there were cut.<br /><br />There is the obligatory \\"Gag Reel,\\" a hilarious collection of blown lines and goofs with Bateman making Page break character time and time again.<br /><br />The \\"Gag Take\\" is an odd scene where Rainn Wilson and Reitman get into it with a mock heated argument.<br /><br />\\"Cast and Crew Jam\\" features the cast and crew members rockin' out to a song in this mock music video.<br /><br />There are \\"Screen Tests\\" for Ellen Page and Michael Cera. In the scene they do together you already see them in character and displaying excellent chemistry. There is also a test with Page and Olivia Thirlby and one with Page and J.K. Simmons as well.<br /><br />\\"Way Beyond `Our' Maturity Level\\" takes a look at the characters of Bleeker, Juno and her best friend Leah with interviews with the actors that inhabit them. Diablo Cody talks about how they are based on people in her life.<br /><br />\\"Diablo Cody is Totally Boss\\" is a profile of this novice screenwriter who got her start writing a blog and got noticed by a film producer. Reitman recalls his initial impressions of the script and the cast gush about its \\"unique voice.\\"<br /><br />\\"Jason Reitman for Shizz\\" takes a look at the director. The producers gush about how he was the right fit for the material. He talks about establishing the right tone and how he shared the same vision for the film as Cody.<br /><br />\\"Honest to Blog!: Creating Juno\\" features Cody and Reitman talking about how the film came together.

B0010VD7EO|4.0|Heard \\"Time To Pretend\\" initially on XM.  Then the track haunted me while viewing the newly released \\"21\\" in the theater.  I had to check the band out further.  The album was one of the greatest purchases ever!  I was not disappointed at all.  Cruised around in my car until I heard \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" in its completion.  These guys are exciting!  Lyrics, bass & drum beats, along with some clever chords...definitely add this one to your collection.    Peace.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Before i bought the DVD set i downloaded the episodes and watched them all.  I loved it so much that i bought the DVD set and i bought Serenity, the movie based of of Firefly.  I would recommend buying this for anybody because it is so amazing.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|This show bleeds Sopranos, but has its own touch.  Hardcore fans of the Sopranos will pick up little things here in there (straight reflexivity from the shows symbolism).    If you are trying to find a new show to watch. This is the one.  It won't leave you disappointed, Don Draper won't allow it!
B0011NVC9I|5.0|Great story, great effects, great overall movie. I was a little sketchy at first when i realized it was mostly an animated movie, but it turned out really well. I can see now that in order to get the effects that they got, they could not have done it any other way.  KUDOS!!!!!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|As much as I wanted to listen to this CD and give it a 5-star rating, I just can't.  After having seen this wonderful show on Broadway (not with Menzel and Chenoweth), I really wanted to hear what the original cast recording had to offer.  The answer is - frustration.  Here's why:    Somehow, somewhere in the translation of the solos (specifically Menzel's), the vocals are FLAT; particularly when the cast chorus backs the soloists up.  There are some magnificently flat singers in the chorus (which was shocking to me), and if you have an ear for pitch they're fairly painful to listen to.  I am completely amazed that this recording made it out of the studio without someone's saying, \\"Whoa, let's tweak that a bit!\\"    It's a real shame, because much of the music is beautiful.  The unmistakable standouts are \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" (Chenoweth's voice is mesmerizing and emotes the lyrics perfectly), and \\"For Good\\".  Thank goodness the chorus didn't back them up (even \\"Defying Gravity\\" is marred because of them).    I'm hoping against all hope that they'll re-record this at some stage!
B000RW3YYA|4.0|Much better than the latter end SG1. Like the old days of Richard Dean Anderson. Fun, Action and Suspense. I don't recommend something easily and I do recommend the Stargate Atlantis Series with high praise!
B000SEHG5U|5.0|The God Delusion is the sort of book one laments not being able to have read 20 or 30 years ago. What a difference it might have made! Dawkins has a simple elegance of explanation that brings his words to life and understanding. There is much to applaud in this work. There is also much that will shock those who 'believe' in the delusion. But I don't think Dawkins wrote this book for those that will reject it out of hand. I for one will be giving it to my 13 yo daughter for her to read if she so chooses - I hope she does decide to read it.

0753513005|4.0|This is a must read for anyone who wants an inside account of one of today's most prolific entrepreneurs's life stories. For generation X, he was right there creating history for us and it's simply fascating to read his experiences. For those who cherish family values, a wonderful confirmation of how the support from parents can encourage children to be successful and socially responsible citizens.    Sir Richard was born at just the right time and he grabbed every opportunity that came his way. His good fortune, through a tremendously strong will to survive and prosper - together with a healthy dose of luck and (perhaps) divine guidance - have positively affected millions. His writing is engrossing, very informative and inspiring.    The only dark spot in the book comes toward the end when he describes Bill Gates as a tremendous example for other entrepreneurs. Not much of a computer person himself, Sir Richard is perhaps unaware of the illegal activities conducted by Microsoft that continue to haunt it and its co-founder Bill Gates, and of the suffering that millions of computer users worldwide had to endure while they fell for Gates's trap to buy cheap, unreliable PCs with poorly written Windows code that unfairly penalized the competition. Microsoft's plundering of rival competitors's market share surpasses the dirty tricks that British Airways used to play on Virgin Atlantic and which Sir Richard so eloquently describes as having overcome - eventually. Bill Gates may be contributing his money to worthy causes, but it is ill-gotten money. Sir Richard praises a criminal for his good work. I wish he would wake up to the folly of his thinking for he does some mighty good work himself.
B0014DBZT2|3.0|You know, praising Nick Cave regardless of whether his tunes deserve it just means you are fawning, not being objective or critical.  Five stars, are you kidding me?!  I give it half that.  I agree with the last reviewer that this is a major disappointment.  I've listened to it quite a bit, so I've given it enough time to comment.  Half this album consists of throwaway tunes and are annoyingly repetitive (i.e., title track and Call Upon The Author), for the devoted only.  The other half are more in line with the last few albums (which means they're worthy of repeat listening).  But this is probably the weakest Nick Cave album in a long time.  Murder Ballads is even better than this.  The standout tunes for me are:    - Today's Lesson  - Night of the Lotus Eaters  - Hold Onto Yourself  - Jesus of the Moon  - Midnight Man

0452289963|4.0|An open letter to Mr Tolle:  ---------------------------    Dear Mr Tolle,    I must vehemently disagree with your statements appearing on page 232 of your very well received and successful book. You stated,     \\"Excessive TV watching and those programs in particular are largely responsible for attention deficit disorder, a mental dysfunction now affecting millions of children worldwide.\\"     My oldest son has ADHD, and my two youngest sons do not. The frustrations and pain that my oldest son often experiences as a result of his ADHD are real and, unfortunately, the disorder will be with him for the rest of his life. Why? Because TV did not cause it, the basis of ADHD is genetic - period. During the week, all my kids live with their mother, and are all exposed to virtually the same amount and content of television, computers, and video games, monitored by my ex-wife. The \\"TV factor\\" appears to have absolutely no \\"ADHD effect\\" on the two younger kids, and never will. That's because they didn't have ADHD to begin with. Do varying levels and intensity of TV, video games, computer and other highly invasive, mental stimulation have some effect? Yes, of course, but they don't cause ADHD as you suggest!     In addition, while my oldest son was in 5th grade, we discovered that he had ADHD. He is now a sophomore in high school, and despite the completely different TV, computer and video exposure that he has experienced over that period of time, his ADHD symptoms have remained relatively unchanged. The only thing that has had any qualitative effect has been medication.    I sincerely appreciate this opportunity to comment on your book, and present to you my thoughts on ADHD. I continue to extract from your book, fresh and exciting value and have reaped wonderful goodness and bounty from your deep, thoughtful, intelligent, and humane teachings and observations. God bless you, and may your life continue to water the seeds of a better world and those of individual growth and happiness.     Kind regards,     Jon Teger

On people pics, flowers, around town, sports and so much more. Its a one on one and it is a book that i will not be lending out to anyone. I will however be buying it for anyone i know that is interested in taking great pictures. Buy the book you will not regret it. I promise!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I have never read the book, but I plan to do so in the near furture after thorougly enjoying this movie. Ciaran Hinds is breathtaking in his depiction, particularly during the scene where they met at the concert and his letter to Anne. A must see for period piece lovers.
B0013R853I|4.0|I am not a big fan of death metal or any metal where the singer just grates his voice along a monotone chorus and you'd never understand wtf he's saying without the lyrics written out for you.  This band is definately not like that.  The music is hard hitting and creative, but what really grabs me is the vocals.  While the majority of the time the singer is growling into his mic, he is amazingly clear and easy to understand and his voice goes through a nice pitch range.  The lyrics are pretty much up front with only a little depth, but that's fine.  I don't expect every band to be a musical version of Shakespeare.
B000LC4CVA|3.0|Fast shipping.  There is a spot in the middle where the recording gets a little funky.  For the most part happy though.

This DVD wrapped up most of the unanswered questions left open in the Series. An appearance by RDA would have been great but only if it would have fit the Story Line. All the Characters in this Series I loved, some I was sorry to see go. Glad Michael Shanks returned, it wasn't quite the same without him.    I would rate this DVD a must see for any Stargate SG-1 Fan but also any fan of Sci-Fi as well.    Looking forward to any Medium that keeps these Characters and the Stargate in circulation.

B000NA1OXY|2.0|...now what do you think of when you think of the word \\"music\\"...think very carefully about this word now...does it have to be a consonant and structured melody? Or is it complex dynamics and articulation with plenty of keychanges that truly make music the enigmous wonder that it should be? Now if you are looking for either with the least bit of dignity...turn around...and if you could break something on the way out you'd be helping me alot...    ...Avril started her career as one of those young stars...the only difference is MTV decided to label her as \\"Punk\\" so people would be decieved into thinking that what they listened to was \\"fresh\\" and with \\"attitude\\" that and they thought \\"hmm...maybe we can make up for the abysmal role models in the past by making someone who seems like they'll rebel to authority only to be controlled by us? Ah-ha! Pure hypocrisy on a cake!! Genius!!!\\" And what we heard were whiney melodies and complaints of a girl (who is actually older then me I might add) that thinks because she has an MTV contract she has an excuse...I'll admitsome of the stuff was mediocore in melody...complexity?(that's not was this music is for however) but of course it soothed some people to think that punk had a soft and decomposed side so I left it alone...to rot of it's own accord and watch the people drink the milk from it's pointless metaphorical udders...    ...but then...we have this...the irony in the title is astounding so I won't even mention it...congratulations...she's got more money for the money machine and let me explain why she's done it (finally get to the point...idiot)...    ...now one in fifteen of you would be considering buying this without even listening to the lead single \\"girlfriend\\" and to you people that would be a big mistake if you have for some coincidence never heard it let me describe it to you...let's say a cheerleader pured ink into her eye...picked up a microphone...decided to embarass an insecure prepubescent boy by saying that she's attracted to him and then running him over with a lawn mower...poor child...another life gone...but yes...the chorus is reminiscent of the song \\"hey nicky!!\\" and instead is about how her envy and vanity get the better of her and she wants to steal someone elses boyfriend...well done Avril...you raised the bar...there's even an awful R'n'B impersonation after the second verse...aww...I just struggle to find respect for someone who doesn't even know how to tweak an ostinato in the slightest...yes Avril leave it be...and us music snobs will be all over you (oh come on! You know it's true...we're jerks!! Haha...because I'm not american it sounds stupid when I say that...but anyway I'm rambling...) but yes...awful awful sound...plus she stole the idea from a least sucessful song that attempted to sue her...they failed...there's a lesson there...you can't knock a giant down with a bowling pin...merely a shield case...very simply don't try and beat her...she has the subliminal sheep on her side...    ...and yes besides that song there is a simple ballad (chords required are merely one digit)...and other stuff...my advice is...if you are a little boy or girl and want something to dance around to until you know better...then please be my guest...I'll be here being pretencious and listenting to stupid noise and calling it art...she's not a teenager any more...she needs to develop talent...beyond mainstream...but yeah whatever it doesn't matter...no one will read this review and give it a negative comment just to start an argument right?

B000001ESN|5.0|A perfect album. The two hits \\"Spirit of Radio\\" & \\"Freewill\\" are stellar. \\"Natural Science\\" is an incredible masterpiece. None of these songs ever get old.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|I bought this for my husband after reading the great reviews it was given by others on Amazon. He has really enjoyed it! He says the details and information are exactly what he wanted. The episodes are about an hour each, so the huge length of the entire set is made into more manageable pieces to watch.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This is an awesome special edition. Plenty more special features that makes it a worthy purchase even if you already have the movie. Firefly was one of the greatest tv shows ever and this movie follows suit perfectly.

B000YAA68C|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theatre and loved it so much that I pre-ordered on Amazon. There aren't too many movies that can bring a tear to your eye and make you fall in love with all of the character's, while making you feel like you are experiencing their heartbreak and sharing in their joy. Excellent performance by Hillary Swank and cast.
B000ZN803G|4.0|I've seen this excellent film twice, once in the theatre and again on video. Can't understand why it only received just 2 oscar nominations while a lesser film like \\"There Will Be Blood\\" received more despite Day-Lewis' excellent performance (that film left me hollow). Am contemplating whether to get this in HD since Paramount has said it will be their last release in that format. Emile Hirsch should have received at least an nomination and Penn himself for Best Director.  One could argue about Chris' tragic fate but in the end he lived it the way he wanted and not by society's standards--so can we say it was wasted?!  The various persons he touched during his journey proved the validity of his life. The entire supporting cast was excellent and this is probably Penn's best film since his debut feature, \\"The Indian Runner\\". Let's hope he continues directing!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've never read the book \\"Wicked\\" or even seen the actual Broadway play, but I have listened to this version of the musical \\"Wicked\\" by Stephen Schwartz and I must say that I have fallen under its spell.  There's something powerful about Broadway music that gets me warped in a dizzy spell and I suddenly find myself in an alternate reality where everybody bursts into song and dance numbers.  But that's just me, I'm silly that way.  Anway, back to \\"Wicked.\\" I believe that this soundtrack is full of entertainment that can be listened for time and time again.  There's something magical about the way that music is portrayed in Broadway musicals and it gets better ever time you listen to it.  There are sever songs that I would like to mention that are probably gonna be favorite forever:<br />\\"The Wizard and I\\"<br />\\"What Is This Feeling\\"<br />\\"Dancing Through Life\\"<br />\\"Popular\\"<br />\\"One Short Day\\"<br />\\"Defying Gravity\\"<br />\\"Wonderful\\"<br />\\"As Long As You're Mine\\"<br />\\"No Good Deed\\"<br />\\"For Good\\"<br /><br />I just absolutely wouldn't know what I would do with myself I haven't found such a passion for some musicals because they bring joy into my life even though some people hate musicals, but I believe they are coming back, and \\"Wicked\\" could be the next musical adaptation.  I'm very proud of this product and hope that I will continue to be under its spell for a very long time and that you will too, gentle listeners.
0792844890|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies. Mel Brooks does an incredible job in spoofing Star Wars and outer space movies in general. Mel Brooks even takes a page out the Steven King handbook by starring in his own movie as Yogart, the wise old dwarf who is like a jedi master from George Lucas' Star Wars,  but instead of using the force, he has the powerful \\"Schwartz.\\" He also stars as President Scroob;  in charge of the Spaceballs (as in the Empire) and of Spaceball City. The movie also stars Bill Pullman (Independence Day), Daphne Zuniga (Melrose Place), John Candy (The Great Outdoors), Rick Moranis (Parenthood, Ghostbusters 1 and 2), JM. J. Bullock (Monroe from Too Close for Comfort), and Dom Deluise (Smokey and the Bandit 2 and Robin Hood: Men in Tights) as the voice of Pizza-the-Hut.<br /><br />Mel Brooks takes on a voyage far far away where we encounter the Spaceballs who are bent on take planet Druidia's air because pm their planet, they're quickly loosing theres as you see President Scoob (Mel Brooks) opening a can of Perri-air. The you have Lone Star (Pullman) and Barf (Candy) who are flying in a Winnebego across the galaxy to save Princess Vespa (Zuniga) from the Spaceballs. The Spaceballs are trying to capture the Princess to use as leverage. When Lone Star saves the Princess, chasing him is Spaceball-1 lead by Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis). Everything was ok as Lone Star was taking the Princess back to Druida when a crisis strikes. Lone Star must also find out about his past that needs some answers. He turns to Yoghurt (Mel Brooks) for answers and training to learn about the Schwartz; even more powerful than the force, lol.<br /><br />Bill Pullman is an underrated actor as he doesn't get casted in those super high money-making blockbusters (with the exception of Independence Day).<br /><br />There were so many plots in the movie but they all worked. You never went through the movie wondering what was going on between the many plots. The comedy was great and the laughs are all over the place. This is a definate classic and one of the greatest spoofs of all time. The DVD has the widescreen version and the only extras are behind the scenes look and some commentaries. The picture is good on a LCD TV. This is a must have for anyone who likes spoofs like Airplane, The Naked Gun, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Scary movie. It's a classic!<br /><br />* I play my DVD's on a Phillips DVD-R upconverting (1080p) DVD player and a Sharp 42\\" Aquos (the 6 series); both which I placed reviews for* Enjoy!place.

B000065V3H|5.0|This has always been one of my fave 80's movies, but I feel it has less to do with true \\"love\\", than it does high school culture. It shows the cliques and the bulling and all the real high school garbage in a glossy way. I love the scene he makes in the cafeteria, it always touches me. This is a great show, but it's more about the politics of high school.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|I had a problem with where the DVD was sent, But when I called/emailed the seller they took care of it immediately (the item was shipped back to the seller). I received the DVD in right away.  Thank you!
B00005R5G9|5.0|Believe it or not, I saw this movie in the theater when I was in the 2nd grade. I just loved it! For years, I asked for a manqein for Christmas for years, on the hopes it would come alive. I never got one. I was a weird kid. Anyways, this is a movie about a window artist who falls in loved with an enchanted manequin who no one else could see as a live person. It is cheesy 80's at it's best. If you haven't seen it, give it a try.
B000F5GO0A|5.0|I had been getting pretty bummed out lately about not being able to find much, what I would call, \\"amazing\\" new music. I found a lot of stuff that was, \\"pretty good\\" and, \\"not bad\\" but nothing really knocked me out like some music had in the best. Then this little delight came along. This album is not some lame and failed attempt to merge old sounds with new. No sir, this is old plus new equals something totally unique and amazing. If you in anyway like the sad and beautiful sounds of old eastern European gypsy accordion horn melodic madness, and enjoy Neutral Milk Hotel, A Hawk and a Hacksaw, or any of those types, then you probably already own this CD. If for some reason you don't already have this, then stray no farther, come back and be fed. Genius.
6305313687|5.0|I had heard of this movie and although I like Edward Norton, I was in no hurry to see it. I happen to catch it on cable one night as I was flipping through the channels, folding laundry. The laundry didn't get finished until much later. This movie was so powerful, it just sucked me right in. I loved the story, acting, writing, everything about it. I highly reccommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.
1844137872|5.0|ONE OF THE SMARTEST, MOST PRODUCTIVE, HUMOROUS, STREET ARTISTS AROUND.  WHAT ALL GOOD GRAFFITI ATTEMPTS, BUT OFTEN FALL SHORT OF  A MUST FOR THE STREET ART LOVER!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I really can't help but wonder why this album was made.  They say it is \\"as the Beatles intended,\\" but did the Beatles really even know what they intended?  The whole concept of this album was muddy and never fully realized (recording a live album of entirely new songs).  And while it's interesting to hear a few of these remixes, this album is so similar to the original (while stripping away the impromptu songs like \\"Dig It\\" and the speaking in between, which gave the album its live and loose feel) that there really is no point in buying it if you own the original.<br /><br />Nobody wanted to touch these recordings in 1969 once the Beatles washed their hands of it.  The only man who did was Phil Spector, who - while fudging the original live \\"concept\\" of the album - really took a lot of sketchy performances and turned Let It Be into something worth listening to.  It's worth pointing out that this \\"de-Spectorized\\" Let It Be...Naked has almost all of the same takes and edits that Spector used.  A few alternate takes are found on ...Naked, and the strings and horns are all gone, but so what?  I heard this already on Anthology 3.  A majority of the songs on here sound untouched.  And personally, I think the album version of \\"Let It Be\\" with its bombastic horns and ascerbic guitar solo is vastly superior to both the single version and the ...Naked version.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" (which is really the biggest reason this album was re-done - thanks, Paul) is stripped down too, but again, I heard this on Anthology 3.<br /><br />And I really do miss the talking in between songs.  It made the album feel more fun, more impromptu, more like the listener is in the room with the Beatles.  By eschewing these short interludes, ...Naked just sounds like another studio album, which actually takes us further away from what the Beatles supposedly \\"intended.\\"<br /><br />I think the original is superior.  ...Naked really doesn't offer anything new.  If you don't own Let It Be, you will probably like this album because, hey, the music is great no matter how you slice it.  But if you've already got Let It Be, this album won't be much of a revelation for you.lbum because, hey, the music is great no matter how you slice it.

B000X9PNOG|3.0|I have been a Meat Loaf fan for a very long time.  I too am a performer,  and I have even played Eddie and Dr. Scott in \\"The Rocky Horror Show\\" which Meat Loaf played in the original Roxie cast. I just want to make it clear I have a deep love and respect for this artist before I continue.    This DVD is not Meat Loaf at his best, but his band and back up vocalists are totally awesome.  I had to overlook many aspects of Meat Loaf's performance on this DVD because he is mostly flat, has problems with tempo and he is obviously struggling with some of the higher notes.    He is however; solid on lyrics.    It about broke my heart to see Meat Loaf struggling through the repertoire.  It is very obvious his support band are helping him all they can.  All the band members are extremely young and have more energy to perform these songs.    As an afterthought, I am not sure if Meat Loaf was having problems singing or he was having problems hearing.  I know a faulty monitoring system will throw off a performance.  Plus when I record, I only listen to the playback with one ear piece and not two.  Trying to listen to yourself over a system can direct you to sing flat.  It's good to have one ear open so you can hear yourself as you actually sound.  Meat Loaf on this DVD has two ear pieces.  He sometimes uses only one. He sounds better when he does this.  Meat Loaf does fiddle with an ear piece a bit which led me to believe he may have been having a technical difficulty.  I still feel external monitors are best...call me old fashioned.    The \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" songs are extremely difficult to perform and listening to the albums is a much better way of enjoying these challenging songs.     This DVD is good to keep as a perspective piece but not as a keepsake of great performances.  It almost should have been billed as \\"Meat Loaf's Band and Meat Loaf\\".  I'm surprised it was released in this condition.      The producers/directors should have had Meat Loaf dub himself afterwards to correct the vocal flaws before the DVD was released.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|Wow, what more can I say.  This is one of the best acts I seen in a long time.  All the songs really have great beats and I can't stop playing the album on my iPod.  My favs include Crushcrushcrush, born for this, Hallelujah, & Let the Flames Begin.  These Guys, (and gal) definitely   ROCK!     Heres hoping a third album come out.
B000006CCG|2.0|Way back in 1984 when I heard WASP's \\"Animal\\" I knew I liked this band and wanted to hear more. The music was rippin' and the lyrics were flat out hysterical (not to mention multiple F bombs in a song on commericial FM radio - I had to get this record)! Well thankfully Animal is now on WASP's self-titled debut while for years it was only available as a single. I really like WASPs guitarists, and Blackie has his moments, but for me WASP was never on the same high level as their competition like Motley Crue and Ratt. After years of owning only The Last Command and First Blood Last Cuts I was excited to finally pick up their debut on CD. However, for me it just didn't live up to my expectations. The four best songs (Animal, I Wanna Be Somebody, L.O.V.E. Machine, and On Your Knees) are all found on the previously mentioned First Blood compilation, which also contains more other great WASP songs over their studio releases in my opinion. If you want to get some WASP I recommend picking up that best of collection, and if you must have a regular release Last Command is much better than their self-titled.
0307394549|5.0|This is one of the best cookie cookbooks I have ever bought.  There are great colored pictures of every cookie and the types of cookies are all seperated out if your in the mood for cruchy, chewy, delicate etc..  I have made several recipes from it already and they are so easy.  There is even a place in the back that describes cooking tools and how to use them and also how to package them as gifts.  I recommend this cookbook to any cookie lover!
B000007ODL|4.0|This is one of those albums that should be in everyone's collection. If you like classic rock, country rock, mellow music, or smooth guitar, check this out. You'll probably recognize Call Me The Breeze, After Midnight, and Cocaine (all of JJ's versions are better than the more famous cover versions) but it's songs like Crazy Mama that really show the brilliance of Cale.
B000085RTX|5.0|A great combination of orchestral and heavy metal. The arrangements are very complex and interesting, not to mention that Kahn is the MAN!     My favorite songs would have to be all 3 in the Elizabeth trilogy which is based on the infamous Elizabeth Bathory. Great songs and great interpretations.     This was the first album of Kamelot's that I got into and I definitely recommend this to everyone!

006135323X|5.0|There has been a wave of books recently on human behavior and some aspects of economics. They range from the absurd and clearly opportunistic ([[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]) to the thoughtful and very informative ([[ASIN:0061234001 Freakonomics [Revised and Expanded]: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything]]).<br /><br />  Dan Ariely is a behavorial economist at MIT. From his descriptions throughout the book, it sounds like a great job: try to figure out why people do what they do and the economic impact thereof. For example, why do people run across town to save $7 on a $25 item, but shrug their shoulders at saving the same amount on a $450 item? Why does The Economist magazine offer an internet subscription only at $59, a print edition at $125 and a print and internet sub at $125? No, that isn't a typo - the print edition alone and the print and internet subscription combined are offered at the same price. Why? It has to do with the predictably irrational behavior of humans. The emphasis is on predictability.<br /><br />  Ariely covers a range of day-to-day behaviors and provides examples of the power expectations and price, to name a few. As both a bonus and an irritant, Ariely explains the experiments used to verify his conclusions. It's irritating because sometimes the detail tends to be boring, even though Ariely has a pleasant writing style. It is a bonus because many of the experiments are fascinating and, in many cases, amusing, such as the one involving $1,400 worth of beer billed to MIT.<br /><br />  This is  fun book. You won't learn all that much that defies commonsense or intuition, but you'll learn a lot about how and why the behavior we take for granted is so predictable. Belongs on your bookshelf right next to \\"Freakonomics\\".<br /><br />Jerry
B0000076MI|5.0|This is the TYA official unedited bootleg provide by the band as a quality recording providing an alternative  to the appalling quality boots around at the time.     Leo Lyons on bass shows that that particular instrument in his hands is a formidable tool in keeping a steady and totally creative sound allowing for Chicks multi layered organ to float within the music thus allowing Alvin Lee to sing his heart out and enjoy himself playing his guitar and you can hear that he is enjoying every note played. Ric plays the drums like a man possessed just listen to the Hobbit.    That this recording is this good shows that the Rolling stones rolling studio was a fine facility allowing us to have and cherish some of the classic live performances from the era. TYA Recorded live is one of them,     This CD version is a very good beautifully remastered package well worth having. I just hope that the good folks at BGO records can persuade Alvin Lee to release some more material from those recordings.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|This cd brings back memories, I was in the 7th grade when it first came out. I love this cd and the remixes are good also and you get a dvd with it. So if you are a Michael Jackson fan this is a must buy.
B00004RF8J|2.0|Things are not going well at Mr. Mushnik's (Vincent Gardenia) flower shop.  He has had no customers for the longest time.  In fact, he can hardly afford to keep paying his two employees, plant nerd Seymour Krelborn (Rick Moranis) and cashier Audrey (Ellen Greene).  Seymour, meanwhile, has a crush on Audrey, but she is currently dating a sadistic dentist named Orin (Steve Martin).<br /><br />Everything changes after an unexpected eclipse of the sun.  Seymour finds an unusual plant.  Naming it Audrey II (voiced by Levi Stubbs but played by a series of puppets), he places it in the shop window.  Almost immediately, it starts to draw in customers.<br /><br />However, Seymour discovers a serious problem.  It requires human blood to live.  And the more he feeds it, the more it starts to grow.  What will happen when the blood from a cut finger no longer satisfies Audrey II?<br /><br />I had long heard of this musical and always been curious about it.  Fortunately, I got to see it for free.  The story was just too strange for me.  I know it was supposed to be funny, but I didn't really find anything to laugh about.  I will say the acting was great, especially Steve Martin as a wanna be Elvis (with black hair even).  The songs were pretty good and catchy as well.<br /><br />But the story!  I could never find anyone to truly root for.  As a result, it became an exercise in waiting to see how things would unfold.  And as I said, I found parts of it painful instead of funny, especially most of the scenes with Steve Martin.  (Yet his acting was great.  Go figure.)  I enjoy dark comedies, but this one was just too dark to find anything funny.<br /><br />As much as I love musicals, this is one I won't be adding to my collection.  Do yourself a favor and hurry on by before Audrey II gets you.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Great movie that gets you thinking about your own perspective of reality.  Jim Carey does very good and the best part is that he did not use one bit of crude humor like he does in many of his other shows.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Overall, I enjoyed this video and recommend it without reservation to anyone interested in the Stargate saga.  I find it the rough equivalent of a two-part episode that closed the story on the Ori's involvement in the Milky Way and Pegasus galaxies.  My only negative criticism is that the discovery and implementation of the Ark happened too quickly.  The story easily could have been extended over several DVDs of this length.  Having stated that, I understand the need to resolve the loose ends in one shot.  I hope there is more Stargate to come.
0553582461|5.0|I wasn't going to write a review for this book. Honestly, I was trying my hardest not to. But hopefully this will give me some way of venting after this book has turned me into an emotional wreck. No exaggeration, since I finished this book near exactly 24 hours ago, I've felt a profound despair and listlessness of spirit.    The sharp observer will notice I have given this book five stars. I couldn't possibly give any of the books of Fitz's saga any less. I simply disagree with the ultimate conclusion; Hobb's writing, to me, is spectacular throughout--the most enjoyable fantasy I've read since Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance novels (and hands-down the most believable) and likewise the Fool is one of my favorite literary characters since Raistlin Majere.    I'm not trying to prevent anyone from reading this series, truly; I loved every minute of the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies with the exception of the last thirty minutes'-hour's worth, and I think only a select number will share my feelings on the inappropriateness of Hobb's chosen ending.    I've read plenty of books with sad endings and accepted them with a few tears and a little remorse, but none with an ending that was so blatantly WRONG that leaves such an indescribable feeling of ... loss, depression, despair, regret or... something. It's a mixture of these sort of uncomfortable feelings and more.    I agree completely with an earlier reviewer who gave this book three stars:    \\"This book broke my heart ... The ending is so tragic to me that I can find little solace in it. I am unable to follow her train of thought to what she deems to be the \\"natural ending\\". I follow the trail originally set out by her and arrive at my own conclusions.\\"    Beware spoilers from here on!    This is exactly, exactly how I feel. Six of the greatest, most unique fantasy novels in my experience were not building up to that worse than mediocre conclusion. Every time I think on the ending it profoundly depresses me. Why the bloody hell did Hobb bring the Fool back to life with all of the pomp we witness--events that quite obviously show the Fool's love reciprocated by Fitz--only to completely slap the reader in the face with the actual end?! I notice she conveniently left Burrich dead so Fitz could take up his place with Molly. I feel absolutely betrayed by the way Hobb leaves things. Better to have left either the Fool or Fitz dead; with both of them alive they should have been together. To inadvertantly quote the prophetic Mr. T, I pity the Fool. He deserved more and better.    I'm going to need counseling to get over this cursed book.
B00132D808|5.0|I love this new album.  Some Panic At The Disco fans might be disappointed if they're expecting to hear the same sound as their last album, because it's entirely different. I'm lovin the vibe of \\"Behind The Sea\\", \\"Do You Know What I'm Seeing?\\", and \\"The Piano Knows Something I Don't\\" which are reminiscent of the sixties (some may say Sgt. Pepper). I can't wait to see where this band heads next.
0670018651|1.0|One problem is simply that any reviews about perfume or cologne will be biased.  One of the main biases I detected in their work is that they barely give the perfume houses of Creed and Bond any credit for producing any good scents.  In fact, they seem to diss on the products of both houses, which I don't understand.  For example, Green Irish Tweed by Creed, which is known as one of the top if not THE top men's cologne in the world, is only given 4 stars out of 5.  Many of the rest of the Creed / Bond group are simply dismissed with offhand comments.  The deeper problem here is that, while written in an engaging way for the most part, everything written is simply a matter of personal opinion.  There's no objective standard out there.  Just opinion.  If you can roll with that, then buy the book.  Otherwise, just sit down at a bookstore and browse one afternoon.  You'll see what I mean.
B000ROALCG|5.0|Every time the CD goes on we can't help but start wiggling.  It's a really well mixed CD and full of groovy tunes.  Highly recommend it!
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Burton did a phemominal job mixing vibrant color and washed out color throughout this picture.  It was a little overboard on gore or I would have rated it higher.  Johnny Depp gives another memorable performance as a mis-guided man who was wrongfully put and jail and who believed his wife was forced to commit suicide and daughter was murdered.  This turns him dark and he seeks revenge on the men who did the deed as well as all the lonely souls of London.    Helena Bonhem-Carter is strikingly beautiful in an Elvira kind of way, is the baker who helps him perform his dirty deeds.
B000ZN802W|5.0|If someone told me that I could never watch another actor create a role, and that I'd have to pick just one to keep with me forever, I would choose Hal Holbrook's role in this movie.  What makes a superb actor?  Just watch him in this movie and you'll have your answer.  He touched me so deeply with his performance, that days later, I am overwhelmed with emotion just thinking about it. This movie pushes everything else aside and gets right to the core of what it means to be human. . .emotions, hopes, dreams, and memories.  This is a beautiful film to the eye and to the soul.  I have a feeling it will haunt me for a very long time.
B000000WCA|4.0|Okay, I may be setting myself up for a lot of laughs here but I really like the Spice Girls.  Okay, so maybe I shouldn't say `really like' but they were big when I was like twelve and me and my friends listened to them all of the time, so whenever I hear songs like `Wannabe' I get, oh what's the word; happy.  There may not be much depth to be found in most of what the Spice Girls have ever released, but their music is fun and sometimes that is more than enough.  With their debut album `Spice', the Spice Girls have strung together a nice collection of fun songs that are hard to dislike.<br /><br />`Wannabe' is just one of those great anthems.  I don't care what you haters want to say, I don't see how you can't like this song.  `Say You'll Be There' is another one that was perfect for the radio; spunky and fresh.  It's not as good as `Wannabe'; in fact none of the songs on this album are as good as their first single, but they are still fun.  `Love Thing' is even better than `Say You'll Be There' and `Who Do You Think You Are' feels like a fiesta; it just makes you want to dance.  `Something Kinda Funny' is that same ol' same funky vibe and `If You Can't Dance' reaches `Who Do You Think You Are' territory.  These are undoubtedly numb songs but they deliver upbeat and energetic music that easily gets into your skin and releases those fabulous things we call endorphins.  Who can be in a bad mood when listening to this stuff?<br /><br />The you have `2 Become 1', one of those silky smooth tracks that gets that mood set perfectly.  These girls have great voices and really compliment one another.  They aren't just one big gimmick, even if that's how they are remembered for the most part.  Just listen to `Naked'; it's slinky and seductive and unlike anything else on the album.  `Last Time Lover' nails the vibe that Spice Girls so effortlessly fell into.  Is it just me or do the verse-line vocals sound like something off TLC's `Crazy Sexy Cool'?  I might be crazy, but I don't think that I am.<br /><br />The one track I am not entirely sold on, and the one I skip more often than not, is `Mamma'.  It just doesn't fit that well with the rest of the album.  It's trying to be deep and meaningful but it's not that facet that bothers me as much as the change up in musical chemistry.  It just doesn't sound like a Spice Girl song.<br /><br />Anyways, I'll close by saying that this is not the greatest album out there but it is such a fun collection of songs I can't help but find enjoyment here.  I know a lot of people write the Spice Girls off as gimmicky and washed up but songs like `Wannabe' will be around for a long time to come and never get old.  Geri, Emma, Mel B, Mel C and Victoria cemented themselves as pop icons and will go down as one of the most recognizable pop acts of the 90's.  No matter what you think of this brand of music you must admit that the Spice Girls mastered it.m.    The one track I am not entirely sold on, and the one I skip more often than not, is `Mamma'.

B000VI70WM|4.0|I have always been impressed with how each DD album sounded unique, and this one is, well, no different.  It takes a bit to get used to, especially if you are looking for a return to the \\"old\\" DD... or want to relive the 80s.  This album does NOT do that.  Rather, it moves along at a usually entertaining clip, but suffers from a weak finish and - to date - no killer track.  Perhaps a Singles version of Nite Runner or Skin Divers will shoot up the charts, but I have my doubts.  Nevertheless, I think the collaboration between DD and JT & Timbaland worked well.  It is an experiment, and I think folks who diss the band for \\"selling out\\" kinda miss that point.  It's not like they've made the partnership permanent (at least I don't think they have).  But I digress...    If I harken back to the old LP days... the \\"A\\" side is much better than the \\"B\\" side here.  Unlike Rio, which finished strong, this album fades.  However, fans of the band will be very pleased, especially with the front 7.  I guess I could break down each... but there's no point.  If I have any complaint(s) regarding the first half+ of the album, it's that (a) the Falling Down single is better than the album version since it is shorter and more to-the-point and (b) Skin Divers and Tempted sound awfully similar - and therefore should not be back to back (or redo Tempted).    Of the final 5, Zoom In (#9) has a nice beat, and She's Too Much (#10) is a good ballad.  But that's about where I usually stop.      In summary, I believe this album to be at least a step above Astronaut... and would put it in the same ballpark as Big Thing or perhaps Notorious.  To folks reading who are not overly familiar with DD... it's catchy, but slips at the end.  Overall, I thought it was very good album.    E
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I was very disappointed in this film, particularly after the hype.  The cinematography is very impressive; visually, the film is beautiful.  Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent, but not drop-dead exceptional.  Comparisons with his performance in Gangs of New York are apt.  The score is striking in its minimalism and insistence, but after awhile it becomes grating and annoying.  Ciaran Hinds is wasted and the other supporting performances are little more than window dressing for DD-L.  This is a virtuoso role as well as a virtuoso performance and everyone else is secondary at best.  The movie is long (2 1/2 hours+), but, surprisingly, the story is undeveloped.  There is a great temporal gap between the final, pivotal scene and those that precede it.  There is also nothing about the lead character's youth in Wisconsin.  He springs full born as an adult.  That would not normally be a problem, but the story here is one of passionate greed and lust for control that devolves into madness.  It would be nice to see that pattern and process's origins.  It is sometimes said that we come to have affection for radically-flawed or even evil characters when we get to know them intimately, since to understand is to forgive, but there are really no central characters in this film who enjoy the audience's affection.  Plainview's deaf son is a possible exception, but he does not exhibit a morality of his own until he is  utterly brutalized by his adoptive father.  Prior to that he is a blank-stare cipher who accepts his father's ways.<br /><br />Some did not enjoy No Country for Old Men, but it is really the diametric opposite of There Will Be Blood.  The plot is airtight; the ensemble cast is superb; the film has a major, significant point (the ravages of drugs and their impact on a society) and, for all its grimness, a sense of minimal redemption in Tommy Lee Jones's character.  It is also beautifully shot--a complete work of art.
B00133KHCY|5.0|Loved every moment of it! Watched it on blu ray with surrond sound blasting! A wonderful love story within a love story. Hated to see it end. Well acted as if it were a real story. Freddie Highmore is a rising star!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this video.  I have two kids and don't have much time or money to work out at a gym.  This video has solved that problem.  Jillian uses basic exercises to get results and I definitely see a difference in my post baby belly. I thought this would be easy but I was very wrong.  The great thing about this video is that the time flies on it and before I know it, I am done.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|If you appreciate the Bad Seeds and Grinderman, you can't go wrong with this release.  I'll spare you the \\"music critic wannabe\\" prose and just get to the point by saying that this is some of Cave's best work in quite some time.  It sort of lands somewhere between Grinderman and earlier work of the Seeds.  The only track I don't care for is \\"Dig, Lazarus, Dig\\".  To me, at least, Nick's singles always seem to be a bit weak.  As for the delightful criticism found in one review here of needing to be on heroin in order to appreciate this material, I know of quite a few former addicts (Nick himself) who have unbelievably excellent taste in music.  Perhaps this music isn't for tweakers.  P.S.  If you're taken aback by some of the negative reviews, I suggest that you go to the \\"read all my reviews\\" sections and look hard.  Criticism of Dig, Lazarus, Dig and praise for Maroon 5's latest crapola pretty much says it all.  The latter are an affront to the modest talents of Hall and Oates.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This movie was magical!<br />Without making this review too much of a downer...I am so glad that a song from this movie was nominated for an award!  I hadn't heard about it and am fairly sure that this movie never came to my local movie theater.<br />A fantastastic and completely uplifting piece of creative genius.  The acting is spot on and a delight to watch.  Captivating and moving.<br />This movie had me from the beginning all the way to the final note!<br />This was truly a delight to stumble upon and wish that the smaller movies such as this one would get more play than the latest slasher/teen drama/comedy stick!<br />This movie was utterly breathtaking and a MUST SEE!!!<br />e.
B0011KQSZ4|1.0|Predictable, cliched, unimaginitive, unoriginal, one gag bollocks! How this script ever made production you couldn't even guess. The set up of the joke is a joke in itself. This is a story written around the one gag the writer must have thought of whilst on the toilet. Spend your money on a blank DVD and get better laughs. Black comedy? Please don't insult the genre....
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Great show, great actors, great writers, great issues.<br /><br />This show was cancelled after one season (Why?!) It was not another Saved by the Bell, or Beverly Hills 90210. It had REAL people with REAL issues. It contained teenage and adult problems, humor, and triumphs. It was the first look at REAL life, with no apologies. I think it was too much for people at the time. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this again. The extra features were informative, funny and worth the time I spent watching them.<br /><br />I recommend this to any who caught an episode years ago and enjoyed it and to any who want a new perspective on family and friends.
B00009XITP|3.0|Overall it is an entertaining movie for the casual viewers but it is, like many other Hollywood films, built on too many stereotypes. We start off with a teenage girl who's never met her father but is eager to meet him based on the stories her mother's told her. She is clumsy, loud, but down to earth and, of course, does not fit into the uptight British society. The filmakers absolutely HAVE to make her fall off of the stage in the fashion show and into the lake off of the boat. And of course there has to be an evil stepmom and stepsis who do everything to get rid of her. Too predictable, nothing new in this movie.
B000002LCE|4.0|When \\" Dream Evil \\" was first released I was very disappointed, maybe it was because Craig goldy's playing was so different than Cambell's, but what the reason was I am not sure anymore. I recently purchased this cd to replace my vinyl copy and I have to say after listening to the cd again after several years I was pleasently surprised. Dio's voice is powerful as always but I was surprised at the strength of the songwriting, and I would recommend this Dio album to any fan of classic heavy metal.

B00005JPTK|4.0|In high school I first saw the \\"Omega Man\\", Charlton Hesston's version of this story. It has remained one of my favorite apocalyptic films, with some pretty wry humor thrown in. When my wife and I went to see this film over Christmas break at the show, I had high hopes, and I was entranced until the final 30 minutes of the film, and then I was what????<br /><br />The movie spent such a long time effectively building sympathy for the protagonist, and then threw it all away by rushing the end. And without giving away the end, the alternative conclusion available on the disk 2 versions, while maybe a bit hokey, was much more satisfying and enjoyable.<br /><br />So my advice is if you are going to buy Legend, get this Two disk special edition

B000244FDW|5.0|By far, I think this is the best adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" out there. I saw this when it first aired in the U.S. on PBS' \\"Masterpiece Theatre\\" many years ago. It's what got me hooked on Ms. Austen.   Elizabeth Garvie played the clever and beautiful Lizzie Bennett to perfection. David Rintoul was very good as Darcy as well (although some would argue he was little \\"too\\" serious). The adaptation with Colin Firth is very good too, but it comes in a distant second to this one. I would recommend this to any Jane Austen fan.

1596680296|5.0|I saw a reference to this book on a yarn company's website and thought I would check it out.  I wanted to learn how to turn a sock heel well.  If you want to learn to make socks, this is the book.  For those who are familiar with Ann Budd's wonderful The Knitter's Handy Book of Sweater Patterns, her sock book is similar in style. It gives you a framework of basic styles and the directions for different sizes, gauges and yarn types, then allows you room to happily play with her ideas and come up with some of your own.  I have been knitting for about 60 years and I learned a couple of tricks from her that I absolutely love, like the felting method of joining wool yarns and the K3 P1 rib that has the perfect degree of stretch for socks.  This book is good for both beginners and experts.  It starts with the simplest basics and includes some intricate patterns for the skilled show-offs, too.  Great book.

B00151HZME|4.0|M83's music has always been very airy, synthy and vaguely abstract in nature. Very post-rock, very spacey electronica, but not pretentiously so.<br /><br />But M83 takes a step in another direction \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" -- instead we get a tongue-in-cheek, vaguely nostaltic expanse of 80s-style teenage angst. There are some jarringly angular moments, but Anthony Gonzalez mostly turns out a pretty, electro-riddled little experience swathed in shoegazer instrumentals and pop melodies.<br /><br />It opens with a very gentle little piano melody, hesitating as if unsure what to play, and is joined by flickers of ephemeral synth. \\"It's your face,\\" a woman's breathless voice sings, as a man murmurs gentle in the shimmering wash. The entire thing keeps swirling in on itself like a forming tropical storm, growing more ethereal and incomprehensible by the second.<br /><br />Now drop all expectations of what this album will be like.<br /><br />\\"Kim and Jessie\\" is a vaguely New Orderish synthpop melody with lots of thudding beats and wailing synth loops.  And most of the songs hover in the middle -- rollicking blurry guitarpop, swirling shimmering dance, urgent electronica, spacey balladry dripping with dance rhythms, shoegazer epics that build up to a mountainous climax, and ethereal pianopop smothered in cloudy synth. The finale is a continuous, ten-minute ambient hum that frankly bored me silly.<br /><br />But it takes until the deliciously tongue-in-cheek \\"Graveyard Girl\\" for the intent of this to become clear -- it's a wistful, mocking soundtrack of teenage angst and moodiness. The very serious line \\"\\"I'm fifteen years old and I feel it's already too late to live. Don't you?\\" is deliciously ironic.<br /><br />Technically it's usually a very bad idea when you fix something that wasn't broke, and Gonzalez appears to be doing that when he revisit the musics and teen movies of the 80s. As a result -- since he does not wholly abandon the spacey electronic/shoegazer sound -- \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" is a mesh of different styles, and there are moments where the fusion doesn't work.<br /><br />But it's quite striking that so many of these songs DO blend together well. We have colourful loops, swirling shimmers, cloudy enveloping waves, and little blips of synth, studded with sharper synth beats. This is all woven togetjer with a lot of gentle piano, and some jangly pop guitar interspersed among the buzzing cycling shoegazer guitar.<br /><br />Unlike before, vocals take front-and-center positions here -- Gonzalez's soft, processed voice glides through. And Morgan Kibby's high, breathless vocals can add anything from gruesome pathos (\\"She digs her nails into her naked chest... she pulls back the skin to show her ribs/they twinkle like shooting stars\\") to the tongue-in-cheek monologue from \\"Graveyard Girl\\" (\\"The cemetery is my home/I want to be a part of it/invisible, even to the night/I will read poetry to the stones/wonder if one day I become one of them\\").<br /><br />It takes awhile to really clue in on what M83's intent in \\"Saturdays = Youth\\" is, but the band's album is a pretty good fusion of synthpop and shoegazer.nd there are moments where the fusion doesn't work.

0553278398|4.0|This prequel to Asimov's classic Foundation trilogy, written almost thirty years after the original stories, is almost as long as the original three books combined.  Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory, has just announced its discovery.  Suddenly, Hari finds on the run, hiding from the Emperor and others who would use his mathematics to further their own political ends.  He is also searching for the clues in history that will allow him to perfect his theory and make it practical for predicting the future.<br /><br />The themes here are as old as man's quest to develop tools to make life easier.  How can these tools be put to best use?  And how do we prevent these same tools from falling into the hands of those that would use them for personal gain at the expense of others?  These questions have been raised again and again as new technologies emerge, and this book provides a long exploration of these questions.<br /><br />This book also helps to link the Foundation series to Asimov's other works, including his Robot stories, helping to create an sweeping history of the future.

0670018651|5.0|Perfumes: The Guide is a refreshing and hilarious look into perfumes from all ends of the spectrum.  Turin and Sanchez laud some surprisingly simple choices (Polo Sport), and unremorsefully condemn some popular perfume giants, such as Cartier's Le Baiser Du Dragon.  Although I will still ultimately choose a perfume by how it smells on me, this book will make it much easier to narrow down the options.  After all, I wouldn't want to walk around smelling like \\"scented glue\\" or \\"barf-bag floral\\".

0670018651|4.0|I bought this on a whim and am *very* glad I did.  This book is both extraordinarily educational and deliciously funny.  Along with some nice, straightforward teachings by obvious experts, the book is filled with hugely entertaining mini-reviews of fragrances.  The classics are hailed but dissected for the benefit of the class.  The mediocre are called on the carpet and judged for both their virtues and their sins.  And the trivial and forgettable are dispatched with short but laser-like descriptions of their one failed mission.  Prepare to see your guilty pleasures nailed to the cross, and your true loves frisked rudely for shoplifted items.  But trust me - it's not like a single Joan Rivers gag photocopied over and over - there's tremendous variety in the reviews.  Many recommend superior but lesser-known fragrances that \\"did it better\\" - extremely useful to newbies.  A lot of history is woven into the reviews - right where you need it.  In fact, the education factor is at least two stars of my review.  There's even a too-short glossary for people who might be put off by \\"aldehyde\\", \\"foug&egrave;re\\", or \\"woody-amber\\".  I would have loved to have seen more.<br /><br />I enjoyed the fact that fragrance classifications were toyed with - and with extreme precision.  For every \\"woody citrus\\" there's something like \\"evil tuberose\\" or \\"sad shampoo\\".  But the authors don't spare themselves from the microscope, either - and hilariously so.  [Spoiler: Tania admits to falling in love with one of my wife's favorites while drunk in the store, only to regret her romantic mistake upon sobering up.]<br /><br />I would not call the reviews mean, but compared to the faux-art BS of the PR flacks, and the generally courteous and literary treatment by fragrance blogistas, these reviews are short and honest to the point of a football tackle - American style.  They demonstrate beautifully that the sense of smell is weighted differently for everybody.  I found myself fist-pumping and yelling \\"hallelujah\\" in agreement with many reviews, but bewildered by others.  In a few cases, the authors didn't even mention my personal \\"love notes\\", while trashing off-notes that I didn't even know were there.  I think this demonstrates why one needs to view it like a trip to the comedy club.  Your particular race, religion, or political party is gonna get some heat.  They may even pick on your spouse a bit.  But it's OK.  If you keep a sense of humor, you'll have a good time.<br /><br />For me, the thing which ultimately sells the book is the frank, intelligent writing.  The authors open up the way the best fragrance journalists do - with 100% honesty, and allowing their points to wander into beautiful and effective analogies and sidebars.  You will learn to have an effective opinion of fragrances by observing these two masters at work.  These two authors have forgotten more about perfume than I will learn in the remainder of my life.  And I now have literally dozens of leads on scents that I'm very likely to really enjoy.  Just think how little a $10-20 investment is next to a single good bottle.  People should get this for the good steers, even if they can't stand to read harsh reviews of their favorites.greement with many reviews, but bewildered by others.

After reading both The Namesake and Interpreter of Maladies, Jhumpa Lahiri has found a permamnent place in my list of authors to read and recommend.

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I read David McCullough's GREAT book in anticipation of this miniseries. McCullough painted a picture of a man and a time that I found fascinating; a picture of a hardworking, sensitive (maybe mildly obsessive-compulsive in terms of his emotional high and lows) genius. I found the first few episodes excellent, albeit different from the book. It is the last few episodes that have really affected my view on this series.     The series insists on focusing on Adams' lows. It seems the writers took all the depressing elements of McCullough's book, which were few, and magnified those to center stage. For instance, John Adams' alcoholic son Charles has a major part in the series, but played a relatively minor role in the book. The mudslinging between Jefferson and Adams in Adams' second election for president was jettisoned for the Charles Adams storyline. Also, Adams, presented by McCullough, was a good natured man with a self-deprecating sense of humor. In the series he seems to live in misery.    They also took scenes that were generally upbeat and made them darker. When Adams meets King George III (in my opinion the climax of the story -  or at least the first half of the story) in the book, the King is very polite and friendly (much like his portrayal in The Madness of King George III). He smiled a lot and made Adams more comfortable, if not less in awe. In the series the King is just plain weird. I can only guess the filmmakers were hinting at King George's future illness/madness. It's almost as if this series is based on another book about John Adams - a darker book. This series really missed the tone of McCullough's great book.    Still -- divorcing myself from the book -- I find this series is well-made and held my attention. Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are very good. My advice would be to watch the series first, then read the book for a much more uplifting story.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|If history bores you, this movie isn't for you. If the founding of the government of the USA is boring, this movie isn't for you. I am a history buff and a Revolutionary War re-enactor and this is, by far, one of the best acted and realistic portrayals I've encountered. Being very familiar with the time period and the founding of the nation, I can sit there and point out the nitpicky details of the scenery that are in error, but the series was not directed with armchair history geniuses in mind. This is for a much broader audience. The performances are fantastic! John Adams was a man of great integrity...qualities that are RARE these days. He was very honorable and had many faults. But, he was sure right about France :0) and he stuck to his convictions. The movie has done justice to the excellent book written by McCullough. One of the funniest reviews I ever read is by a person who reviewed the John Adams book. He/she said it was extremely boring because it was a history book! Duh!

B000UFAURI|5.0|After several years of weak albums, Foo Fighters step up to the plate and prove that they are more than a burnt out Nirvana spinoff. Producing one of their most solid albums in all of their musical careers, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace will easily be considered to be one of the groups finest albums.<br /><br />I had been disappointed in the band's last few tries at albums, and had almost lost hope in FF, but this new album is easily one of my favorite CDs in all of my collection.<br /><br />This album has a rich variety songs on it, and shows the bands diverse song writing talent. The album seems to be a successful experiment the band took in changing the direction the band was going.<br /><br />Virtually every song on the album is worth listening to. What really makes this album worth buying though, is the array of incredibly good songs which are not featured on the radio.<br /><br />Perhaps the best song on the album, Stranger Things Have Happened, presently a thankfully unpolished acoustic based rhythm with strong vocals, which truly show Dave Grohl's musical genus, all set at a good pace.<br /><br />Another jewel on the CD is Summer's End, which provides a more poppy catchy polished tune.<br /><br />A very rarely seen instrumental is also on the album. \\"Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners\\" is a development which I hope to see more of in future albums.<br /><br />I cannot strongly enough recommend this album. Its one of the very few recent albums they have which is on par with their late 90s work.

B000PFU7OO|1.0|I had the misfortune of watching this film in theaters. Drawn in on promises of a thrilling musical score and a story based on a struggling musician's life, I was sorely disappointed.    I will keep my opinion of the actual film separate from this review, as this is just the sound track.    Bottom line is that this musical score, is lacking, especially for a soundtrack of a film so centered around music. The vast majority of the songs take beginners guitar chords and place it against mediocre vocals which often repeat themselves to the point that it becomes apparent that the writers thought up one basic hook and failed to come up with anything more.    Perhaps the sound track truly does not deserve a 1 star rating, but I am putting the rating of this score that low to counter balance other people's overrating reviews.    These songs failed miserably to wow me. The composers seemed scared to venture out of their comfortable zone, creating a uniformly bland album. You would be better off saving your money for this one trick pony soundtrack.
0525948023|1.0|I was disturbed and alarmed to think that Tolle's book \\"A New Earth\\" has received such praise from so many people as a result Oprah Winfrey's endorsement. I read it on the recommendation of not one, but two friends, which perhaps is what upsets me more than anything.     If I try to be open and detached, I can see that people who are genuinely seeking spiritual growth can find some wisdom here. The book is grounded in belief in a spiritual reality beyond the vision of our egos, it does a good job of describing how much suffering comes from egotism and how much insanity grips our world today, and it is wise to advise that one cultivate an attitude of presence to others and awareness of life.    However, in honesty, I found myself distressed by several things. This book is a homily (satsang) not a book of science or philosophy - it is repetitive and sometimes condescending, and makes any number of claims that are simply not true or unsupported by any body of knowledge. Contrary to Tolle's perhaps artistic interpretation, \\"ego\\" is not an independent entity in the world with its own collective volition; an individual's ego is not the source of all evil (but in fact is a necessary aspect of the development of a healthy person); there is no such creature as a pain-body, let alone the intentionality ascribed to it; etc. etc.     By objectifying and demonizing ego, feelings, time, and other normal human realities, Tolle is fragmenting and condemning most of the life and reality that we are given, the precious uniqueness and complexity of life as a human person. The book is profoundly NOT coming from an incarnational religious philosophy.  The Judeo-Christian religious traditions teach that God is immanent, that God is found in our world, and that we discover that we are held by the loving God in the experiences and feelings and even the pain of human life.     I do not know the Buddhist tradition well enough to be able to see if this great wisdom tradition is also being presented in superficial or distorted ways. I find myself wondering about that; it would seem that there is room for a more embodied and compassionate Buddhism than what I find here.     Tolle's presentation of spiritual traditions and human psychology is alienating and ultimately very sad to read. I said to my husband the other night, \\"If I were to attempt the kind of awakening and detachment from my emotions and experiences that Tolle seems to be recommending, I would never be truthful with you about my real feelings. I'd appear to be serene, but we would have no true intimate relationship, heart to heart.\\"     But the saddest thing is that this book could lead someone to seek God by attempting to stamp out one's humanity and relatedness. When we are touched by God, it is by grace and love, and it is in the dignity of our real, imperfect life and personhood.  I hope I can find common ground with those of my friends who have found inspiration from this book. I want to acknowledge the good in it, but also, in integrity, to give it my honest response.
1847670911|4.0|As far as books by presidential candidates go, this one is surprisingly good.  Probably because it's a candid memoir, written before Obama tossed his hat into the race.  Moving and at times powerfully written, Dreams from My Father breezes along and provides insight into the man who hopes to be the next US president.
B00005JPTK|2.0|As many people have already said this Movie does not follow the book at all.    I do not even understand why they would title the movie after the book to begin with. (Spoiler) The simple fact that the book ends with \\"I am Legend\\" meaning the future vamp/humans would always remember him as a monster who murdered people and live on in their dreams and future stories told to children (like a witch or Dracula) does not hold true to the movie , in fact the movie ends with \\"they will remember his legend\\" a man who fought for a cure.  Aside from that it doesn't really explain a lot and with out some background knowledge you would probably find this film a little confusing. It really is not that good.
0316113506|5.0|The book documents very well the highly favorable impact of regular exercise on mental health.  The fact that the author is a practicing psychiatrist lends credibility to the overall conclusion that exercise is good for you mentally as well as figuratively.  Not being a scientist, I do not fully understand the author's quite technical explanations of how exercise changes the biology of the brain to make a person better mentally.  Nevertheless, he is strongly convincing.    Anyone interest in the health benefits of exercise and the health risks of not exercising ought to read this book.      If you are already regularly active, the book will motivate you to be more so.  If not, it should give you incentive to get off the couch.

B00177Y9ZM|4.0|Jumper was exactly what the preview promised: Flashy action sequences, exotic destinations, and a man with an ability that gets him noticed by the wrong guys. The acting was surprisingly good by both Christianson and Jackson...neither of which are favorites of mine. Nonetheless, this movie still delivered thrills. The directing by Doug Liman, as well as the pulse-pounding score by John Powell (both worked together on Bourne Identity and Mr. and Mrs. Smith) help deliver the thrills non-stop. My only major complaint was that as soon as you begin to get to know the characters and get interested in the story, it's over. The movie climax felt like it should have been the half-way point from which more rising action and a grand finale could be built upon. Despite this, however, great music, great action, great effects, and not-so-bad acting make for a pretty decent flick. I'll be watching this again.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|My husband and I were very impressed with this movie.  Definitely worth the wait.  Wonderful end to a wonderful series.
0060512806|3.0|It was a struggle to finish this book.  The book is an excellent 400 page novel crammed into a 900 page tome.  I can't believe that the book wasn't heavily pruned by an editor prior to release.    Some parts of the book are indeed very entertaining and funny.  At other times, it's like reading the phone book.

B000N6TYLW|2.0|Gilmore Girls - The Complete Seventh Season is the final season of this show and I could never figure out why everyone adored this fast-talking dramedy. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel get two stars since they are good actress' but the plots and dialogue just drive me crazy, hey I enjoy wordy people but this takes the cake, I get a migrane listening to all the mindless chatter. Love it or hate it, this show isn't for me.
0375424474|5.0|In July of 2004 paleontologist Neil Shubin and his team discovered a fossil that bridged the gap between fish and land-living animals. It was, and is, the fossil equivalent to a gold mine, a missing link in evolution. The real story begins much earlier.    Actually, there are a few different stories involved in this book. There is Neil Shubin's personal story of a life in paleontology and biology. There is the story of the human interest in how we are designed, and why, and how that relates to other species. Encompassing all of that is the observable physical history of evolution. Shubin is generous enough to treat readers to the highlights of all of these.    I found this book eminently readable, interesting, eye opening, educational, and actually fun. It made digging for fossils in often unpleasant conditions sound like fun. Suddenly scientific discoveries were exciting. Most of all though, for someone who unquestioningly accepts that we evolved from monkeys, the knowledge and understanding of how humans evolved from fish was a revelation. All of this is done with an impressive ability to build steppingstones of information, teach without overwhelming, and infuse a surprising sense of humor.    I am grateful not only for Neil Shubin's work, but his ability to pull past and present information together in a way that even a science dunce (me) could understand.    Armchair Interviews says: Author is PhD at University of Chicago in the Department of Organismal Biology and Anatomy.
B000002C4J|3.0|Let's Talk About Love by Celine Dion is an album I used to have back in the day. I'll be honest I was a fan of Celine but not anymore, her lifeless voice and weird stage presence just completely turned me off after My Heart Will Go On became huge. Celine let the success of that song go to her head and she hasn't recorded a powerful album since. There are some good tracks on this album, but not brilliant. Immortality, Tell Him, To Love You More, and I Hate You Then I Love You are the standouts but that's pretty much it. This is a mixed bag, take it or leave it.

B00154GEFU|5.0|What seemed to be an impossible dream finally came true in 2006 when all four original members of Asia reunited on stage.  Two years later, the band presents their long overdue follow-up to 1983's ALPHA, and it seems they haven't missed a beat.  This album has all the hallmarks of the classic band, with the more introspective lyricism of Wetton's recent solo and ICON outings.  Three songs date to the eighties, letting the band wrap up some unfinished business: \\"Déyà,\\" \\"Over and Over,\\" and \\"Alibis\\" (previously known as \\"Jodie\\").  Furthermore, the verses on \\"No Way Back\\" sound strikingly like those from the Wetton/Downes tune, \\"Walking On Air,\\" now attached to a catchier chorus.  After the success of the Wetton/Downes ICON albums which helped pave the way for the full reunion, I was pleased to find that two of the most captivating songs were those written by Steve Howe.  Surprisingly, one of the more haunting tunes, \\"Orchard of Mines,\\" is a cover of a song from \\"Epicon\\" by Globus, and it is perfectly suited to John Wetton's voice.  This is a mature album from a classic band; it almost makes me believe I've found myself in '82 again.
B00063MC0C|4.0|The sound quality on these \\"remastered\\" tunes are absolutely outstanding. John's voice and the instrumentation never sounded better. Those of us who still have vinyl immediately notice the difference in sound quality.    I do have one complaint about this CD. The Imagine Sound Track collection included John's version of Real Love. Listening to John's version of Real Love, you would immediately notice that the version the \\"reunited\\" Beatles included in Anthology 2 is different then the direction John was going with this tune. The Lennon Legend CD should have included John's version of Real Love to make this collection truly complete.    As it stands, this CD is definitely a plus for any collection.
B00005Y6YB|4.0|Sorry, thought I was reviewing the shippers but seeing now that the review is for the item itself, I give it 5 stars, the best Western I have seen, the story, the acting, the scenery, all top notch!!!
B000LZ52YI|5.0|As I delved deeper and deeper into Bowie's back catalogue I found this excellent album. I have never been a big fan of David Bowie which is admittedly a great singer, Though one of rock's most influential figure  the quality sound is perfect I recommend this CD .
B0013FBS20|4.0|I love this movie, for the price you cant go wrong. I will continue to buy my movies from Amazon.
B00000016N|5.0|I wanted to suggest to those Doors fans who are angry about the music being re-mastered to buy the re-mixes because they are interesting and pretty affordable., well maybe you're not that much of a Doors nut, anyway I digress again. What I have done when I have bought these re-masters is to listen to the re-mix version first, I have always been interested in music production and engineering .  If you're a longtime fan you'll probably want to have both in your collection. I have been digging these in a big way. Highly recommended!!!
B0008KLVG4|5.0|One of the most , correction.. pretty much THE most well made films i have ever seen, with an amazing attention to detail and creatvity in scene shots. I have to hand it to the production team for their role in planning the sequences.<br /><br />It tells the story of three men, hunting a great white that terrorizes the swimmers and people of a quiet beach town in New England and of the tourists coming to celebrate 4th of July.<br /><br />Some of my favorite were<br />1. \\"We're gonna need a bigger boat\\"<br />2. \\"farewell and adieu to you fair spanish ladies..\\"<br />3. \\"Hooper, stop playing with yourself\\"!<br />4. Scene, when the Chief is shovelling the meat into the water and when he turns to look and talk to Quint, the Shark emerges from the water.<br />5. The reflections of the ocean water against the glass of the captain's cabin<br />6. The shot of the feet of the three people when they cross the boat along the sides.<br />7. Quint's monologue on the USS Indianapolis.<br />8. \\"Smile you sonuvab***h\\"!<br /><br />But the best part was the award winning score by John Williams, becoming a part of pop culture in reference to any shark or animal stealth attack.<br /><br />I cannot think of any person who has not seen it and very few who do not own it in their collection.<br /><br />This is termed as a \\"classic\\" , no uneccessary adjectives or anything, just a classic
B000000IRY|5.0|I have to confess that, while I love Clapton, his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair. And I can't say I am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately. For me I enjoy his work with Cream, his guest work, his first few albums, the one he recorded with The Band, a few older live albums, and bits of the Phil Collins-produced record in the early 80s. After that it's a fall-off, but I am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years. this cd is a must and quality sound is perfect.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I haven't seen this production yet as I cable , but not HBO, but by the reviews you can see what makes the world go round as there are many diverse opinons about this production and Adams himself who BTW is a distant relative of mine. I don't think some on realized just how much a part he was of the founding fathers. What did he chair or participate in 30/60 committee's ?, he had brillant mind & he did get the British soldiers out of being hung.   Fact, he's the only member of the Founding Father's that has no memorial to him in DC not even a statue- what an oversight. I look forward to watching this production then makeup mine if I like it or not, and not by some on here. I have the book this production came from and enjoyed it so i'm wainting see if the Mini series does the same. Besides there no such thing as perfect movie to all.
B000000ISR|5.0|What does it mean to be a musician? I love music of many kinds but unfortunately for me I don't understand its structure, and so I can't seem to figure out how to play. I am a person who constantly has a song running through his head, I breathe in time to music, so music is very much a part of me. That's why it's fortunate for all of us who don't play that there are musicians like Eric Clapton.   This one of the finest greatest rock & roll I am happy to have it in my collections,  don't hesitate to buy it it's a must.
B0013FFMOK|5.0|Having seen the original \\"Last Man on Earth,\\" and the \\"Omega Man\\" I wasn't sure what to expect and so set up no expectations.  Will Smith did a great job and with a few twists and turns different from the originals this movie was well done and had me on the edge of my seat throughout and right up to the end. Well worth my time.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is a very clever little show....The plot is great, the backstories are fantastic, and the whole idea behind Dexter is totally original....Which makes watching the show interesting and addicting....I wish they would have made more episodes for season one, but season 2 will have to do.....Highly rcmd these DVD's
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a fan of \\"Stargate SG1\\" and the original movie \\"Stargate\\" I've been watching the TV show since its inception.  As a result and seeing no end in sight of the ORI I just had to purchase this and find out how or if they were finally defeated.  Of course they are defeated but had I stuck to only TV to find out what happened - it wouldn't have.  All the characters were as usual and wonderful and although I felt this might be predictable... it wasn't. A perfect ending for the ORI - as it should be.
6305426651|5.0|This is one of the truest love stories ever written. It is not about the holocaust. The holocaust, as an event exemplifies everything ugly and hateful that we should fear in ourselves; the capacity of all of us to be led and to follow in fear, no matter what we believe. The holocaust should never, ever be forgotten.  It should stand as eternal proof of what we can all become, by simply not paying attention.     This film used the holocaust as a backdrop for surviving, but it is about more than surviving. It is about living, loving and sacrificing. It is about the love of a simple man for a woman, a woman for a man, and their love for their son. It is about the love they share and the values that sustain them through what must have been one of the most horrific experiences life can offer. Whether or not it's realistic that a man can make jokes through such internment, or make a game of it for his son, it is the beauty of people, of love, and of life that we can focus our gaze beyond the ugliness, shelter our own hopeful innocence, and show one another the beauty of ourselves, and of the world we share.     For those who wish to compare it to Schindlers List, it is not Schindler's List. It is far better. Shindler's list is about an ordinary man who comes through a moment in time and becomes a hero. La Vita e' Bella is about a man who shows us how to be simply heroic. La Vita e' Bella is timeless.
B00133KFGW|5.0|When I saw \\"August Rush\\" advertised it got my attention as a music lover.  I was not familiar with the actors but went ahead and ordered and was wonderfully surprised by the acting, especially of the young lad who plays \\"August Rush\\" and the great and touching story. Robin Williams as a Fagan (the \\"Oliver: type character) was excellent. I was very happy with this movie and have told many of my friends about it as a result.
6305311463|5.0|If Norman Rockwell and Orson Scott Card had a child, in a bizarre new world, they would have written the screenplay for \\"Armageddon\\".  An uncompromising look at what goes into the word Americana, Michael Bay has crafted a story that is pumped full of so many clich&eacute;s that it becomes an entertaining, full-throttle action film that can be watched again and again.  With a surprising cast and superb special effects, Bay uses the camera to create powerful artistic images coupled with the staples of what makes films of this nature unique.  In this reviewer's eyes, \\"Armageddon\\" is one of those films where Bay has tricked the common audience.  It is a typical summer blockbuster in every sense of the word, there are explosions, there are great lines, there are out-of-this world scenes, but he does this while incorporating hidden messages throughout.  Perhaps I am looking a bit too deep into just another science fiction action film, but when \\"Armageddon\\" came through the DVD player, I wasn't ready.  I was a nay-sayer to Criterion for adding this film to their collection, but now - in 2008 - it makes perfect sense.  Michael Bay has created a picture-perfect image of America.  He has taken our desire for the inanimate, our non-perfect hero, slices of us through images of the Midwest (or of a time that we may have forgotten), and our religion to be the best and transformed it into a film.  Yes, this is a science fiction film, yes this is the film about the big asteroid that only Bruce Willis can stop, and yes - Ben Affleck does attempt to act - but it is perfection.  If our country was eliminated, and we needed a film for our history books - I wouldn't argue with \\"Armageddon\\".  Now, let's let the argument begin.<br /><br />The acting, come on, it's \\"Armageddon\\" people, but Bay is notorious for at least creating enjoyable characters.  Buscemi is always worth the screen time, while Will Patton rounds out the voice of reason.  The looming voiceover by Charlton Heston seemed to suck me into the story, while Willis and Affleck's banter seemed over the top, and at times annoying.  They played their parts perfectly, yet it still had me on the edge of my seat.  Liv Tyler gave it her all, and the way Bay filmed her (less words more emotion) was perfect.  She carried the weight of her father and soon-to-be fianc&eacute; well into the asteroid.  Compliments should be handed to Mr. Thornton as well, the man has a pair of chops on him, and if he could avoid the angry comedian films, he could remember that he has the talent.  He was the epitome of NASA, the genius that had to work on the worst budget to save the world.  Rewinding back to the notion that this is America in all of it's glory, these characters work perfectly.  Willis' character reminded me of a mortal superhero.  His ability to drill anywhere was his power, and his sense of nationalism, his idea of patriotism, bled from the screen.  \\"Armageddon\\" played like a comic, with your muscling characters, cheap jokes, picture-esque landscapes, and simple fix to a big problem.  Again, it was clich&eacute; - all of these characters can be seen in any other film close to the same nature or entitled \\"summer blockbuster\\", but with Bay, he seemed to be saying more.  Affleck was the only downfall on the character side.  He was Ben playing Ben; there wasn't that sense of anything outside of comic timing and love interest needed.  He wasn't Bruce, he wasn't anyone except filler.  Yet again, for this film, it worked.<br /><br />The story was simple.  Bay simply used the K.I.S.S. method to compile the script (the Keep It Simple Stupid), asteroid headed to Earth, nobody saw it, and it is up to Bruce to surrender to the beast.  It is Mr. Michael Bay that must be complimented for this film.  While other critics will argue that this isn't anything but drivel, I found it to be symbolic, surreal, and honest all at the same time.  While other films will show America in a way that only the educated will see it,Bay throws it right in our face and we are unable to stop it.  Golf on a cruise liner, Willis portraying this \\"everyman\\", the types of cars that our characters drive, the fact that upon completion of this task everyone want inanimate objects (power, sex, money), one cannot help but wonder what Bay is attempting to say about our culture.  Michael Bay is the director of gluttony.  I can attest that I couldn't stand this film upon viewing it the first time.  I was horrified to see it in the Criterion gambit, but watching it again - older and wiser with film - I am happy to see it in the collection.  \\"Armageddon\\" is America.  It is the birth of the superhero, it is the clich&eacute; Americana that we face everyday; it is exactly what makes American cinema - well - American.  Bay, in this film, has captured the truth.  What makes this summer blockbuster even more enticing is that there is just a sprinkling of explosions, and most don't happen until the final third of the film.  He has tricked us, made us believe that this is a no-brainer of a film, when it is in fact chalk full of symbolism that the faintest of film aficionados can smile under their breath.<br /><br />Overall, as I begin to sound more and more repetitive, \\"Armageddon\\" [the Criterion release] blew my mind for the first time although it was my second viewing.  A new found respect for Mr. Bay's work has been discovered, and while \\"Transformers\\" will never live up the hype, the early work of Bay remain pivotal instruments in American cinema.  I am eager to re-watch again Bay's \\"The Rock\\" which also found a Criterion release, with skeptics on both sides.  The Norman Rockwell vision, the lack of any real science fiction until the third act, and the detail of the characters without devoting hours upon hours to them, made for strong - unparalleled cinema.  Students could study this film, they could ask themselves if this is the vision of America, if this is the Americana we all love - work hard, play harder and maybe, just maybe, you too could play animal cracker safari on some girl next to the latest BMW model.  Who doesn't believe this is the American dream?<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****nd we are unable to stop it.

0440419514|3.0|...it ends rather disappointedly. The first book was excellent, with a strong beginning, good characters and an exciting new world. It's a fun read for any adult who loves fantasy. However, the second and third books try too hard to do everything and end up being less than what they could have been. While it's interesting to see how the story wraps up, the second and third books were more obviously meant for children as opposed to a broader audience. The new characters introduced in the latter book are weak, and they end up taking away from the really strong characters developed from the first book. However, the religious/anti-religious \\"message\\" that has been protested by so many is subtle to the point that I really didn't notice it. I'd recommend this book for young teens or younger.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Ark of Truth nicely wraps up the rest of the Ori storyline, and it has some good cinematography to it. However, it's a very short movie, at only 80 minutes long, and it felt at times that the producers were trying to put too much in the movie without giving it all the proper storytelling that it deserved. This movie could've been improved with about 30 more minutes added onto it. There were times when I felt like I was watching what could actually have been individual episode plots had the show been renewed for an 11th season, but have now been mashed together to make one big episode/movie. Also, because it was now a movie, it seemed like the director felt that the ante had to be upped, making the villains even badder, the situations even more dire, and the characters even more whumped. However, despite it's somewhat rushed feeling, I enjoyed all of it. It was nice to see Vala's old husband, Tomin, and know what finally hapened to him, and it felt good to see the team together again. It goes without saying that most SG-1 fans will like it, so if you're an Stargate fan, it really is a must see, if for nothing else than closure.
B000005RFQ|5.0|This album got a bad rap when it came out but this is pretty much the last good album by Sabbath until 'Reunion.'    This album was criticized because many unfairly compared Gillan to Dio.  Ian Gillan did a great job on this album and Sabbath couldn't have picked a better high profile lead singer to replace Ronnie James Dio.  All of the songs on this album are really good except perhaps for the last part of the title song where Gillan's voice breaks.  Otherwise, songs like 'Thrashed', 'Disturbing The Priest', 'Zero The Hero', and 'Digital B****' still rock after over 20 years.    This is the last really good Sabbath album until 'Reunion' and it still rocks after all these years.  Check it out!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I'm not a professional critic by any means. Aside from a couple of quick CGI graphics that didn't look real enough (admittedly I'm picky where that is concerned), I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />If you're a fan of SG-1 then you will definitely like this. It was more fun than I had hoped from something straight to DVD. I can't wait for the next one they're finishing.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|This is great!  The footage of a young Johnny Cash was fun to watch but the highlights for me were Bob Dylan and a hard to recognize Waylon Jennings!  We enjoyed every minute.  I would have liked to see a little more of the different show segments in place of the commentary.  I am very pleased with this purchase and plan on viewing it again as soon as I get it back from those I loaned it to!
B000P0J05G|5.0|I give the movie itself 5 stars, I give the producers along with HD-DVD -5 stars!  Army of Darkness one of the greatest cult classics of the horror genre, and having been released 100 different times in a 100 different versions, and what does HD-DVD give you?  NOTHING!  They could have at least added the original ending, or the bonus material that is available on the standard Def DVD's.  No wonder HD-DVD is Officially dead.  What the hell is the point in releasing a great movie like this if you do not plan on putting at least the original supplements on it?!!  However though HD is HD and I must have one of my all time favorites on HD, so I'll just grin and bare it for now and at least enjoy the fact that I can watch it in high Def.  I had the foresight to get a Hybrid player that plays both HD formats.  So in closing for all you deadite fans hopefully Sony will release a more difinitive version somewhere down the line like they did with Evil Dead 2 now that Universal is no longer contractually obligated to being HD-DVD exclusive.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|julie taymor is a creative genius and poet--and has made one of the best movies ive ever had the pleasure to watch-which ive done over and over-- it also has the best commentary since the one on moonstruck-- another gem-- but this whirlwind and tour de force--- is everything the beatles could have dreamt for -to inspire a film of the 60s and their amazing music--great inspiration setting fire to more great inspiration---- and like i said the commentary is as good and required viewing as the movie itself- to realize that every detail of this movie more or less came from julie's diviine imagination is a revelation ---the commentary explains how they made the beatles songs new again- by taking out pauls baselines--not because they werent brilliant but because if the songs remained the same-- our minds upon hearing the first notes of any beatles song finish the songs in our heads--its like in our dna by now ! by giving these great songs new and oftentimes more hip baselines they are reinvented and gain from the infusion of the new-- also getting us more into the story from which the songs grow out of--rather than thrown on top of-- just the realization of julie-- that the songs inherently tell a story of their time-just that alone is a stroke of genius--that she was so ably committed to getting it out of her head and onto film-- mostly on locations that ring so true--- its just a revelation and joy to behold this whole enterprise----the incredible mise en scene throughout is impeccable-costumes sets art direction photography  televison images from the time - and of course the choreography !! ( julie did the lion king on bdway )the knitting of all this together---so incredible- the acting the dialogue the story told w such creativity beauty and poignancy---- i was moved beyond measure and relived things in such a way that i was transfixed and totally taken aback-- u know the saying--if u remember the 60s u werent there---well julie remembered and we all benefit --her protean talent is awe inspiring---eddie izzard a genius of an actor -when hes w someone like julie anyway-given free reign by her-- he does the mr kite number like the inspired madman he truly seems to be---one moment among so many that take yer breath away---many hitherto unknown actors reach incredible heights under julies deft and dedicated  direction and attention to detail !( its all in the details !! )-- and joe cocker !!!!!! a revelation  !!!! in many roles singing and acting that really blew me away & the songs werent recorded later but recorded during the filming- so the voiciings come from the energy of the scenes ---u hear these beatle songs like never before !! and thats saying a lot of course-----so often i would just play back scenes just to watch them again cuz i couldnt believe the sheer brilliance of what i was seeing and hearing-the fact that this masterpiece of filmmaking was basically ignored by the academy and not lauded and applauded for the rare gem that it is-- must be to my thinking- that it isnt politically correct -its about love-- and anti war----its beyond me how something this great hasnt gotten the acclaim and attention it deserves-----i can only think that like another gem from another generation--- a movie called its a wonderful life !!! as it didnt garner much praise when it was first released---this movie too like that one will someday surely take its place -- as a peak in the art and history of our filmmaking-- it is timeless like all great art- let alone the defining of an era-- this movie has to be seen to be believed--- its not the story per se--- we've seen similar in hair----but believe me-- if u lived and loved what the 60s really stood for in so many of our minds-or if yer younger and want to know--- check this out----its a trip and a half !!!!!!!! if u can watch a scene-& the even more amazing audition on the commentary- of the gospel singer singing at the grave of a young boy- and not cry---yer the living dead !!!!! i dont know if anyone involved in this awesome enterprise willl ever again  be a part of something this special-i truly doubt it---- but we are lucky indeeed to witness the miracle of this movie ---pleasures this deep-on film- arent made but once in a lifetime---- this is in the class of the best of fellini- and that is saying a lot too ( fellini and kurasowa- and to my taste bergman too- men who never put anything but sheer genius on film )!!!!!! this is in their class- (well very close anyway !!! ) and to think i was reluctant to see this movie- i thought it would be just music videos from beatle songs-----so my surprise was doubled again----  at one point julie says on the commentary- thats she hopes john isnt turning over in his grave as the saying goes----well even if his spirit could ever be confined to a grave-- wherever he is-- i don't think he's turning over julie- i think he's  spinning out in boundless joy over the genius u have wrought w this fine film!!! get this great experience -savor every frame and enjoy it forever !!!! kudos to all involved and god bless u julie taymor( and whoever gave u the money to do it !!!)now if anyone involved in this awesome enterprise willl ever again  be a part of something this special-i truly doubt it---- but we are lucky indeeed to witness the miracle of this movie ---pleasures this deep-on film- arent made but once in a lifetime---- this is in the class of the best of fellini- and that is saying a lot too ( fellini and kurasowa- and to my taste bergman too- men who never put anything but sheer genius on film )!!!!!! this is in their class- (well very close anyway !!! ) and to think i was reluctant to see this movie- i thought it would be just music videos from beatle songs-----so my surprise was doubled again----  at one point julie says on the commentary- thats she hopes john isnt turning over in his grave as the saying goes----well even if his spirit could ever be confined to a grave-- wherever he is-- i don't think he's turning over julie- i think he's  spinning out in boundless joy over the genius u have wrought w this fine film!!! get this great experience -savor every frame and enjoy it forever !!!! kudos to all involved and god bless u julie taymor( and whoever gave u the money to do it !!!)

B0011HF6GE|5.0|Heard them on NPR and bought the album immediately. Its such a pleasure to find music like this. My album of the year for 2008.
0060987464|5.0|It was great to read some of what has really happened, not only behind the scenes but to have some of the media's BS stories have a little light shined upon them.  I've heard the rumors and stories, and I've been to the concerts.  I'm not saying I would send my teenage kids alone, but then again, I wouldn't send them to 7-11 alone.  I would however, take them to a show in a heartbeat.  I was 16 when I first saw MM with the Jim Rose Circus open up for NIN and that was a great experience.      Brian Warner wanted to become a performer and a rockstar, and so he created Marilyn Manson.  This is a great read for anyone who doesn't know about him and would like a little insight on the man behind the makeup.
B000U7169M|5.0|There have been a lot of swamp movies lately (Skeleton Key, Venom, Hatchet) and all of them are amazing, this one, however, stands out.  This one takes the religious overture of the movie and heats it up.  Though cheesy in some scenes (flies on the BBQ), the movie stays strong to the plot and doesn't leave us with questions.  The effects are the only thing that wasn't top notch with this movie, but I guess they spent all their money getting Hilary Swank to do a horror movie after winning her Academy Award.  Great movie overall.

B000021Y77|4.0|Quite honestly, I wasn't impressed at the first 20 minutes, but my lovely wife had warned me that it starts slow but turns into a movie worth watching, so I didn't hit the eject button.<br /><br />She was right.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />The beginning has very stylish music and visuals, along with a breakneck pace and a very difficult problem to solve, but what you don't know is that you're being set up for something you probably won't expect.  I didn't.  And I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil the surprise.<br /><br />Note my rating.  I'm quite impressed.
