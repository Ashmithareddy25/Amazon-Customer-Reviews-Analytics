B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I own 2 chromecasts, one in the living room and one in the bed room. They work great, especially after the updates. Sometimes they need to be reset or re started but that's to be expected.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app was easy to install, even easier to use. I like the fact that it's always available to check the weather, don't have to load the app, open it and wait, hate waiting!<br /><br />I also like the chance earn points toward rewards, double win!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Quite easy to install I started reading my book the very next day on my tablet. Its cool it keeps my page when I'm finish reading
B008JFUN6E|3.0|I don't mind brainless sci-fi. Sometimes it's nice just to have something cool to look at for awhile. Also, I have no problem with movies that moralize. It's great to question things, propose new ideas, or just point at injustices in the hopes of raising awareness. I DO, however, have a problem when a movie ends up being both, especially since a lot of the time it ends up accidentally trivializing something I usually already care about. Case in point: Elysium.<br /><br />The story concerns Max, a reformed criminal who lives in a futuristic, devastated Los Angeles. The world, ravaged by pollution and overpopulation, is now filled with nothing but the poor and lower classes. If you're lucky, like Max, you have a job. In his case, he works for Armadyne, the company that produces the robots that police and monitor the world. All of the wealthiest people in the world, meanwhile, have created Elysium, a utopian space colony in orbit high above Earth, where they live in unbelievably crystalline splendor. They also have these magical beds that can instantly cure any disease or ailment in a matter of seconds. The poor folk on Earth, of course, must deal with second-rate health care that, while seemingly public, is dismissive and half-hearted. When an accident at work gives Max less than a week to live, he dons a superstrong exo-skeleton and undertakes a mission to make it to Elysium to get to one of those magic, medical beds. During the course of his mission, he finds his own selfish views challenged by corrupt senators, mind-bogglingly cute kids with leukemia, and a helter-skelter style military strong-arm named Kruger.<br /><br />Visually appealing with some stunning action sequences, the movie is a popcorn muncher from nearly the first frame (although I'm leaving out the first five minutes of clunky Hallmark-style exposition and character development, much of which involves a nun). Directed by the same guy who gave us the rousing and engaging District 9, the pacing, framing, and cinematography is pretty much top-of-the-line.<br /><br />The problem is that the script is about as heavy-handed as that big stone guy from The NeverEnding Story. The symbolism has got all of the subtlety of a sledgehammer, and when you step back and really think about the story, there's a whole lot that doesn't make sense. For instance, it's never clear why these medical beds are hoarded on Elysium. Do they use an excessive amount of power or resources? Is it considered economically or socially better to have the bulk of your citizenry in a state of malnourishment and filth? Do they break down easily? It automatically classifies the Haves of the movie as heartless and selfish for no real, good reason. Furthermore, the Haves are totemized in the cold, unforgiving character of Secretary of Defense Jessica Delacourt (Jodie Foster doing ... well, whatever kind of accent she was aiming for, the result was awful and distracting). Ms. Delacourt's machinations tend to be completely nonsensical as well. I won't give too much away, other than to say that some of her behavior hinges on the fact that Presidents, in this future, can be displaced by rebooting computer programs. It'd be like waking up one day and discovering that Sarah Palin is the President instead of Obama. &#34;But how? Why?&#34; we'd ask. &#34;This computer says she is,&#34; they say. &#34;Oh. Okay, then.&#34;<br /><br />Huh?<br /><br />Obviously a morality play about apartheid, social divisions, the economic gap, and human rights, the movie takes a message that I tend to agree with and makes it so cartoonish and implausible that it almost seems to be making fun of it. The action, the 'splosions, the cool fight scenes, and the various swooping, wooshing, clanking destruction of it all makes for some fun, mindless viewing, but when the movie tries to prove that it does have some kind of brainwave, it gets both in-your-face and nearly incomprehensible. In other words, the seriousness of the film has asmuch brassy, crazy fire as the shallower elements, making it all seem rather patronizing.<br /><br />Try not to think too hard about it, and you might enjoy yourself, but be warned. When it's not dazzling you with its pyrotechnic skill, the movie WILL try to get you to think. That's probably the point when you should get up for more popcorn.much brassy, crazy fire as the shallower elements, making it all seem rather patronizing.<br /><br />Try not to think too hard about it, and you might enjoy yourself, but be warned.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The pages are full of useful and insightful information. There are several sentences in the book that I had to re-read because I had never thought of things in such a way. And then there is Pam's sense of humor. Just when you think things are getting a little too deep and spiritual she breaks things up with a real life humor. Just loved this book. Easy to read and understand and appreciate.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|First of all I'm not a critic or a musician and this is the first time ever that I write an album review. Having said that it is amazing even to myself that this is the album that excited me so much to the point of writing a comment here in amazon. To me this album is AMAZING. I try to let myself go when I listen to albums and forget the many concepts we have of which album is better or worse. I just did not feel on their previous albums what I felt listening to this album. I have not been so excited about an album for a very long time. To me this album is a masterpiece for our generation. I urge people who don't let themselves influence on which genres to like, that being pop, rock, merengue, hip-hop, disco, salsa, waltz, tango, opera, etc etc. And instead just focusing on what you feel for a certain piece of music. I urge them to please go and give this album a good try and you might just find a golden treasure just as I did.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The book is not the best Mr. Grisham has written. The characters were stereotyped. The plot was too contrived. the more interesting people were the daughter, the judge and the drunk lawyer. It  was an easy read. But, not especially<br />top of the line.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|I've decided I want to grow up and be Helen Mirren....I loved Red and this is just as good.  Like the way the movie makes our older heroes fun to watch and they don't make them caricatures.  The story is good and I too love the &#34;blowey up stuff&#34; and dry humor.  Makes my day.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Works great! I love how I can customize the dpi settings to whatever I want. Fits very comfortably as well.

B0037B6QSY|5.0|The author of this book presented his topic with clarity and vision.  Jon Kabat-Zinn's writing is concise and unassuming.  In plain English he talks of mindfulness meditation and daily life as valuable partners to the pursuit of personal inner growth.<br /><br />The book is one you would be able to return to, reread and find fresh insight over time.  I purchased the Kindle edition and have several sections highlighted.<br /><br />I also recommend the recorded meditations available on CD or as mp3 downloads. The recordings bring the themes from the book into play, facilitating your meditation practice.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|The game is alright, but it takes a long time to get your money up to buy new weapons or clothes. They really want you to buy more coins. To me it's not worth it for a platformer.

B00E34A9FU|5.0|I really love the Grateful Dead band alot, but nothing wrong with the music itself on the dvd, the music is great, dont get me wrong but I only dislike some people thats naked on the dvd on background.<br /><br />Seeing some people naked is sick, sorry if I offended u people that were around in 1970s and saw the actual concert.<br /><br />I enjoy listening to tons of songs like casey jones, dark star, etc. and I have all studio albums and some live GD albums. That band and also Eric Clapton, Frank Zappa, tons of techno, trance and jazz music I arent to picky when it comes to music.<br /><br />Anyway I discover this band on my own back at mid 2000's, in 1990s and before then I grew up with Frank Zappa music, my father loved zappa, thats how I knew of it, anyway I like both of the bands the most!<br /><br />Grateful Dead and Frank Zappa rules!<br /><br />I'll list some of my music taste. I'm not good at reviews but what the hell, lol<br /><br />Eric Clapton<br />Allman brothers band<br />Michael Jackson<br />Frank zappa<br />Grateful Dead<br />Ozric Tentacles<br />Steve Hillage band<br />Eat Static<br />ZubZub<br />Steven Wilson band<br />Porcupine Tree<br />Bob Dylan<br />Miles Davis, Weather Report, John coltrane, Chick Corea, Return to forever: featuring Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock<br />many others and I like techno and trance music too.<br /><br />But the dead and zappa are the best ones, that I listen too the most!<br /><br />Anyway I'll be 34 soon which some people say I'm too young to like the dead, but screw them.<br /><br />Casey Jones is a real name of some GD song, NOT some made up cartoon character from Teenage mutant ninja turtles :)

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I died to get this app and once I did I became extremely dissatisfied because it constantly stops and wants you to pay to continue to play, if not you have to wait for various periods of time before you can continue, which is frustrating to me. Although this is a free app., you will spend money in order to progress,beware.

Just bring up your CHROME browser, using the Chromecast extension(which both are vey easy to set up) and choose to CAST it...there ya go.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the format.  I found death to be sensitive and caring which is so contrary to all I've ever believed about death.  I loved that death was so gentle with the souls lost to the holocaust.
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|I was really enjoying the game and purchased the starter pack when the game reset causing me to start again (no starter pack included). Annoying, trying to decide if I want to start again.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Introduction<br />The Modern Combat series is by all accounts a ripoff of the Call of Duty Modern Warfare series and lets face it, it's pretty well made for a mobile app. It does not however, retain its counterparts crucial campaign elements. I will not go into a detail contrast between the two franchise, but I will say that it's a very good alternative for those who are a fan of the Modern Warfare series. Video gaming on our home consoles has become such a commodity due to the time restraints many of us adults suffer such as our jobs or other personal hinderence.The Modern Combat series serves as a healthy alternative for our gaming needs on-the-go. And lets be honest, either way we slice it, no other company makes this much of an ambitious game for iOS and Android.<br /><br />Gameplay<br />Not a lot can be said about the controls because controls on touchscreen devices have always been difficult and only a few die hard mobile gamers have gotten it down to a science. I will praise Gameloft for the plethora of customizations you can do to make it a little less arduous. I however have managed to sync my handset to my sixaxis controller to get that &#34;console like&#34; experience. It's much easier as oppse to the touchscreen controller but it's still a little cumbersome to say the least.<br /><br />Graphics<br />The graphics is the best on iOS and Android. Rivaled only by NOVA 3. The environment is beautiful, the smoke and dust effects are present as well as dynamic lighting. But suffers from poor character models and graphical and gameplay glitches. There are a few distorted textures here and there, which is especially evident upon closer inspection. But despite all its minor short comings, it is one of the most beautiful game on the market now and you'd be hard pressed to find another that can match its visuals. (except for NOVA 3 as I mentioned)<br /><br />Campaign<br />Modern Combat 4 plays much like its predecessors or any other mobile fps for that matter. The campaign is litter with set pieces moving faster than the player can grasp. Jumping between the protanganist and the antagonist is a little disorienting, but the inclusion of playing as your nemesis is a welcome addition. It follows its linear traditional shoot'em up story that makes no effort to entice the player to continue playing. The antagonist, Edward Page makes it all the more unbearable to play the campaign all the way. The poor voice acting is inevitable, but Page takes it to the next level by shouting anti-government ramblings whenever possible. It's like someone wrote a How to be a Terrorist guide and Page is an avid reader. It becomes less laughable and becomes infuriating. As I stated, your comrades in arms will shout water-down military jargon every chance they get. &#34;Weapons free, open fire&#34; is repeated every single time you encounter a group of nonstop spawning enemies. I could go on, but I understand that people don't play these games for the story so I'll spare you from my rants.<br /><br />Multiplayer<br />After the update, I have come to enjoy the online experience greatly. The visual update and the gameplay tweakes makes it all the more worth paying the minor toll to quenching your thirst for mobile online fps gaming. I was blown away by the near Call of Duty customization it offers as well as the ability to customize your weapon using a fully rendered preview of which ever weapon you have in your inventory. There are a lot of weapons to choose from as well as accessories that goes along with them. Of course these accessories effect your weapon's performance. You also have the option to pick what &#34;military support&#34; and &#34;perks&#34; you want to aid you in your conquest. These features are also available for purchase with real money if you really want to win matches. I on the other hand find no need to do so, so I will stick with earning them the hard way.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I gave this game 4 out of 5 stars solely because of the campaign. The poor voice acting and script becomes unbearable as soon as you start playing the first mission. If you are looking for a great online gaming experience for your mobile device, then look no further than this. It is the full package when it comes to fps games. Graphics is one of the best, but the character model could have been better. It is not a step above nor is it close to what NOVA 3 has achieved though but still a step in the right direction for the series. I would pay a little more for a better campaign though, because as much as cliche shooter stories goes, I still enjoy a great story and a good narrative. I know that's asking a lot from a mobile game, but it would make the game feel like a complete experience.e of the campaign.

B00E6M3QLI|5.0|Ry at his very best … in fact this is his best record in many, many years! Terry Evans and Arnold McCuller are in fine form as is Flaco. The sound quality is excellent, which puts the icing on the cake of this not-to-be-missed release.<br /><br />Get the LP if you have a turntable. You WILL NOT be sorry!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It is fun to return to a familiar setting, Ford County, with some familiar characters to experience another exciting Grisham legal thriller!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It took a little while to like this book, but I'm glad I stuck with it.  It's masterful.  I initially didn't like any of the characters and felt like I had a bad taste in my mouth while reading.  That changed.  I went from not caring what happened to anyone, to being sucked into what would happen to many of the characters.<br />The writing is great, the story is horrifying and yet moving.  There are so many details in the book that make for great discussion.
B005VGUA5S|5.0|I'm a big Pink Martini fan and this collection is a nice sampling of their work.  I play it frequently .
B005N95JA4|5.0|I've always loved this album since the day it came out.  This is not only the best album since Ronnie joined the band but it is either 5th or 6th best album by the Stones.  The bonus CD blew me away.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  It was like getting a brand new album by the Stones except it's from the 70's  I have had it a short time and I don't know the name of all the songs but believe me if you are a true Stones fan you will love it, I promise you.  It totally caught me off guard.  I have 5 or 6 bootleg type albums which are just not that good except for a couple of songs on each of them.  This bonus CD is just flat out great, just about every cut is a rocker worth wearing out like the great Stone stuff.  It's raw but somehow polished as well....More or less the Stone's MO.  If you really love the Stones get this deluxe edition CD  I wouldn't lie to you
B007D2XSW0|3.0|It's ok. It could use more editing options. The filters are kinda weak. The sharpening tool is ok. And it works fast.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game you should get it. I love it it so fun. its hard to get past vector tho. its so awsome
B007VUA7VO|4.0|The app is attractive and I found myself using it more often when I first purchased it, but it gives great information, and is easy to set to your own specialities! Love it!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|No glitches or anything so I really have no problem with the game. The downside is that once you get up to a point it may or may not just stop working for no reason.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love this game I used to play the original game on my phone but was not happy with it I am playing on my kindle fire HD and I'm enjoying this new game

B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is very fun to play as addictive, it's more fun then the original castleville.<br />I'm glad it's on the kindle fire devices cause not everyone has Google store
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|It is a fun game, if you don't mind that the game randomly will delete progress.  I went from level 8 to level 11 three times.  I would start project that take 3-6 hours and then when I log back in, gone.  Happened again, deleted game, good luck
B0086449YA|4.0|Good mix of music to appreciate Mark's range of talent. Easy listening as usual. Adds to my collection of Mark's outstanding music.

B0063GORYU|1.0|Puzzle quit working.  After playing Spider for some time, it required an internet connection to continue; I want a game that I can play without requiring an internet connection especially when traveling.  Neither do I have any interest in 'required' upgrades to the app; upgrades are frequently 'downgrades' in my opinion so I don't want to take the chance.  In addition, every time I opened a new game, a pop-up appeared offering me a 'better' game; that was frustrating to deal with every single time.  Other than these two problems, Spider was excellent and I wish I still had it but I had to delete it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|5stars!!!!!! This book is amazing!!! Sara Shepards point of view is astonishing!!! I would consider this book to people, especially teenagers, who love drama, or young adult novels!!!  Once you start you cannot stop!!!  #PLL

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Liked the graphics and the gameplay. Also it wasn't too difficult and I have really enjoyed so far. Good game.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|This app is awesome and very addictive. The only thing I am getting mad at, is that it won't let me connect to Facebook so I have no neighbors and I can't get the extra RC that I need to complete on of my machines. This needs to be fixed. Badly.

B00ARF93AQ|4.0|First off, many kudos belong to Karl Urban for NOT TAKING OFF HIS HELMET! I get it, actors like people to see their faces and it helps when you can see expressions and so forth, but this is not &#34;The Bicycle Thief&#34;, we want action and slugfests and wacky superhero nonsense, which this movie pretty much delivers. Hats off to Mr. Urban for having the integrity to stay true to the character, whose face has never been shown (as far as I know and no, the Stallone version doesn't count).<br /><br />Anyway, for those who aren't familiar with the comic or had the regrettable experience of only knowing Dredd from the Stallone version of the movie, here's the basics: Dredd is a street judge, so he is cop, judge and executioner. This whole movie is basically about him doing that, and that's all the plot needed, really. The rest is mostly bullets.<br /><br />This isn't the greatest action movie ever, but I think it's better than most and they did a pretty fair job with the setting and effects and such, and it's definitely worth renting for an hour and a half-ish  of fairly mindless fun.
1250038820|5.0|It's a great book.  Epic, really.  Brandon has a good eye for who we really are as a species.  Makes me hopeful!!

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast, D'Aagosta and company are great recurring characters.  Add in his twin sons, Nazis, or the Boys From Brazil, and you have a story that cannot be put down.<br /><br />I read this novel on my Kindle on the iPad, had to keep it plugged in and charging, because I was spellbound!  Over the years I have read many of the Preston/Child novels and enjoyed nearly every one.  This one is at the top of the list!<br /><br />Because I am writing on my iPad I simply cannot go into detail but if you like Preston and Child novels, this one is a treat!<br /><br />[I am glad I had an opportunity to edit this review, as when Amazon sent a copy to me, I saw that it was filled with typos ... I blame that on the iPad!]
B00GH4R95C|5.0|This film was very good, giving good back ground on Superman and back to the original story. Combining the original two movies from the 80's and dropping the love story out of the picture worked well for me. I felt the move was done very well, if your a fan of Superman or DC Comics I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book seemed a bit strange at first, but then I was caught...and could not escape...didn't want to escape, from this heart wrenching story.  I loved many characters and hated some.  The humanity here is real. A real winner.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|This is a fascinating collection of story-songs from Sting's upcoming musical.  While I'm certain that they would have even greater meaning within the context of the show, the songs stand alone.  A must for Sting fans.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I find myself getting apps, using them for a couple days and then forgetting I have them until I eventually delete them. Not with Crossme Colors. This game has held my attention for months. Before bed, waiting somewhere, or really just with found free time I enjoy playing this challenging puzzle game. Well worth the five dollars.
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I really liked this book to be honest. John has given me another reason to love him. I've read 3 of his books and I plan in reading his other works as well.<br /><br />An Abundance of Katherine's was the perfect blend of humor, love, and confidence needed. All he wanted was to be better than what he was. He simply tried using concrete things to fix his so called problems when the true solution was abstract.<br /><br />In the end, he found his twentieth Katherine. But this time his calculation proved wrong. She was the opposite of a Katherine. And her name wasn't Katherine.<br /><br />I wonder what the Katherine's are doing right now.
1476727651|5.0|Mr. King delivers again! Another book that is destined to become a movie and a classic. Reminds me of The Green Mile.
0307719774|5.0|One thing I'm glad I read in the reviews prior to purchasing was the size of the book. This made me debate whether or not I wanted to get it. The book just sounded too cool to pass up. I'm SO GLAD I bought it! It is small, but it opens easily enough and there is just enough room to put a few short sentences in each night. It's fun to narrow down an answer before I just start writing. What I end up jotting down is truly my thoughtful answer to the day's question. Don't hesitate due to size. I'm already looking forward to tomorrow's question! P.S. I don't read ahead. I think it'll keep the entries exciting.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|As always John Grisham wrote another winner. It kept me turning the pages.  I couln't put it down.  Can't wait for his next book.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love this game would tell all my friends to play will play for ever love the characters and the graphics th colors are great can't wait for more characters and more buildings
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|its a very good product works very well just that it might heat up if used for too long that why i gave it a 4
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I haven't been playing long enough to decide how I would rate it. The only reason I am doing it now is because my choices are to pay for the full version or rate it to get a sequel. Either I missed the mini games or they weren't in the &quot;free&quot; version. Therefore, I give it 3 stars because I like the little bit I have seen so far and hope to get the chance to check out a mini game.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This device has a strong signal, enough to override most local stations. Does exactly what I needed from an FM transmitter, where most other transmitters fall short. The bottom part came unscrewed on me once, but it easily screwed back together, so it was not an issue, sound quality is superb.
B005XE33FM|2.0|I hate to have to do this, but I honestly hate this album. I'm a die hard Soundgarden fan and adore Chris cornells voice, but everything about this album seems half assed. Chris Cornell  sounds scratchy and tired, like he doesnt care. Plus there's a fade out between tracks that takes away from the experience. Not a fan of this one. Just my honest opinion.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Fairly standard Jack Reacher. tends to be a bit predictable<br />Has'nt been the same since I saw little Tom Cruise playing him in the recent movie!.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have no idea why this book got such terrible reviews by everybody. Yeah it's different, no it's not more of the same, yes it ends the series. What else do you want? Stop complaining!
B009O2XY12|5.0|So much fun! Get it for yourself, and enjoy hours of fun, or just take a break from stress! But watch the time.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I really enjoyed season one of this show. It was short, but to the point. It didn't feel short, which was a good thing. Although I liked season two, I didn't love it like season one. There's less action and at times seems kind of boring and slow. The finale is great, and there are two specific scenes which are still probably my favorite. No spoilers here. Fans probably know what I'm talking about. Still, it's good and worth watching.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Doesn't work with a TV hooked up to a Bose stereo surround system.  So that sort of complicates things when you have a media system.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|I'm so happy Daniel Craig became James Bond. A different kind of James Bond. The cool, calm, collected Sean Connery James Bond is gone. Daniel Craig James will kill you. Do not F with him. This movie is great. Watch it. Love it.
B00GIZO674|4.0|I just can't stop playing this game. I feel it helps keep you on your feet. You just have to gave this game a try.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|Honestly, I had no desire to watch this film. Nothing against it, it  just didnt appeal to me. That being said, my wife brought it home and I sat in on it and its actually very good and we'll done. It's a true story, acted very well, and is pretty emotional in parts. I think it will win some awards. Definitely worth watching.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season is a bit more roller-coaster-y than past, but we're still hooked, I have to respect their willingness to play with the cast and introduce new members while saying goodbye to others as they have in previous seasons.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|This movie is God awful! The only thing that I enjoyed about the film is the art style, the way it looks. It us a good looking movie. However, the movie itself is a train wreck. It doesn't make sense, has terrible acting, and feels more like a very long music video.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is an Addictive and fun game. I wish you didn't have to wait so long for extra lives without paying.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I tried to get it and when I got it, it said I had to delete some stuff and I did but it still did not work. I got REALLY MAD because I deleted all my stuff for nothing.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This S*** should not be allowed on movies or to sell. Do NOT take a childs toy and turn it into such a disgusting, pervertated piece of S***. It was totally disgusting
B009MB682W|5.0|I love this album so very much. If you are a bond lover, or just a lover of music you should buy this album.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is so much fun!  On a boring Friday or Saturday night, make a big bowl of popcorn and watch &#34;O Brother Where Art Thou.&#34;  Excellent movie for a stay-at-home date night.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|I love Indiana Jones, but was a little disappointed in this one. It was just overall weird. I will still watch it, but it's not as great as the first three.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Great meal ideas. Requires a bit of planning with respect to getting produce/ingredients, but recipes are laid out well and pictures help visualize what the end product is supposed to look like, assuming you're not a hack in the kitchen like me who can't even get to that!
B00005V9IK|5.0|Awesome movie, I've watched it several times. Will Smith is one of my favorite actors anyway.<br />But this is still a great movie.
0316074314|5.0|I am a avid reader and writer ...this work is astounding to one who is seldom astounded...watch for more that they may be even close to this in quality would be moronic. This young lady is not just very, very, good, she is beyond description! Thank you Eleanor!
B00008WT5M|5.0|Awesome recording, my wife played it so much in her CRV. Soon it quit playing??? go figure.<br />So, I had to get another one.
1932100660|5.0|This book is outstanding for its presentation of the facts of why we should avoid animal-source foods in our diet, and it's the study that lead to the conclusion, not the other way around. I've always been health-conscious, but suspected vegans were a bit extreme. Not after reading this book! I highly recommend.
630542845X|5.0|This is one of my Favorite movies, the actors are awesome, but the message is even more awesome.<br />If Jesus visited us today, I believe this is exactly how he would be treated.<br />We have become such a &#34; gotta have proof &#34; nation that even when The Truth visits us. We would still seek proof.<br />I watched this movie by myself one day, and Powder as a modern day Jesus, and this movie took on a totally different meaning.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing, helps me distress when I take my break at work. My sisters and I keep track of our levels
B002361MLA|5.0|Difficult to understand on a first reading but I came back to it having abandoned it three years ago. After having completed a workshop on 'Living in the Now' Tolle's concepts were considerably clearer. I have now advanced to reading 'A New Earth' and am finding it very powerful.<br />This is the way to live our lives  - forget the outer drama and materialism and know what is of most importance.
B000EQ5HSK|5.0|Great hood.  I bought an &#34;off-brand&#34; for this same lens and it could be seen in the pictures at mid- to widest settings.  This one solved that problem.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|An absolute classic - I love it. After watching so many vampire movies and reading vampire stories, I reached for the original and was not disappointed. Beautifully written with tension building throughout, it is thought provoking as well as entertaining.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|It really hit home.  There is a major lack of sensitivity In today's world.  This book reminds us of that.
B00005JLEU|5.0|One of the best stories that disney ever presented.  Too bad disney does not represent this movies too much because is not a girly movie and full of princesses.<br /><br />Its about a young girl in the spirit world doing the best she can to save her parents and go back home.  Watch the movie if you want more detail, you will not regret your purchase or any of your time watching this movie especially with your family.<br /><br />5stars...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I haven't been this addicted to a game in a long time!  Starts out easy but as the levels progress it gets more challenging.  I forget to breath while Im playing it... its that good!
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|One of the better stories from Clint Eastwood for the modern times.  As being one of the best Actors/Film producers of all time since his cowboy days, I was sure this movies was not going to disappoint........and it didn't
B00F35BV64|2.0|I now know that I simply do not like the new Star Trek franchise. I wasnt sure after the first movie but to completely screw up the &#34;Khan&#34; movie takes some doing but they managed to do just that. The movie sucks.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Kept me interested, kept me reading. Different plot, enjoyable characters, particularly liked the authors descriptions and verbiage. Looking forward to the sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game with the minions you can run jump roll and collect bananas however you have to bug tokens with real money but I love this app
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey pulls the reader into the story.  Once this happens, the reader ends up thinking about the different parts of a relationship.  The reader also begins to analyze which parts of a relationship to they need in order to make it work .  Do they need love, tenderness, and caring or is incredible sex enough? The ending makes the reader want more
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I've been looking for a game with a variety of puzzles that is challenging and fun. This is it and you don't have to spend money to play if you don't want to.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is a must for any history fan. It is well writen and the plot is not predictable. the story enveoples you and you will be sad when the book ends as you do not want the story to end.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am really enjoying Candy Crush!  I love the fact the more levels you complete, the more challenging it gets!
B00003CXD0|5.0|My mom knows I am the go-to person for getting her movies and she enjoys this movie very much.  I was only too happy to get it for her.  This is such a classic movie that you should see.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|i downloaded it and it &#34;worked&#34; but we could never get a better signal that what was offered through the provider.  WE walked around the airport and it was the same deal all the time.  waves and graphs but no real explanation of what it was saying.
B00G4I0DNG|3.0|I viewed this documentary on Instant Video. I should say that my overall impression might be a bit biased, as I had read a good deal about this film in advance. I had seen the critics reviews and listened to some of the public commentary at various sites. This perhaps has led to a few somewhat biased and unrealistic expectations that were not fulfilled.<br /><br />I have always held negative feelings towards the idea of keeping large ocean mammals in captivity. I am not completely against the notion of keeping or displaying captive animals for the purpose of conservation, public educational, or even entertainment. It's just that when dealing with animals the size of Orca's, it stretches reason to conclude that one can provide an environment with enough space and stimulation to adequately mimic their natural environment. The sterile confines of an empty concrete pool are so far removed from the daily life of such an animal that one can conclude that such an environment is not suitable for captivity. In a sense, then, this documentary was preaching to the choir in regards to my personal viewership. I will therefore reserve my comments to the actual merits of the film as a documentary.<br /><br />Overall, the documentary itself is professionally-made and has enough material to keep your interest. From an emotional standpoint, it is exactly what you would expect to see from such a documentary and the director relies heavily on the empathy of the viewer to get the point across. And this is where I think the film falls short--both in what it does and what it doesn't do.<br /><br />In my opinion, the film relies too heavily on emotion as the primary ingredient and falls short on facts.  There are tidbits of information that are provided by a number of the participating scientists. However, I was hoping for more information than  was provided, For example, we are told about the collapsed dorsal fin that plagues captive Orcas, but are not provided with any information on what negative effects this has on the whale's health or ability to swim.  The trainers also provide little in the way of information and appear to be there as emotional props. They readily share their intimate feelings on the subject but provide little in the way of information on the day-to-day activity of a Seaworld trainer interacting with orcas.  We only hear about the undesirable aspects of the job.<br /><br />There is also the anthropomorphizing element that pervades the film. A neurologist is brought in to tell us that Orcas are complex emotional creatures with a wide range of complex thoughts and feelings, just like us, perhaps even more so. Apparently, one subject was even examined inside a CT Scan. In a nuthsell, we are told that these aquatic mammals are just like us in almost every way, except for the fins and blowhole. The neurologist seems to be implying that any behavior that resembles the result of human volition equates to the same in the animal itself. The truth is, any truly objective scientist would tell us that we simply don't know what is going on inside the mind of an animal when talking about emotions and their relation to specific instances of behavior. In short, nobody can accurately read the thoughts of another being--no matter how intelligent that being may be. Why did the whale Tilikum decide to pull Dawn Brancheau into the water on that specific day and time and specific place? The truth is, nobody can say with certainty. All anyone can do is offer personal opinion, or at best, informed conjecture.<br /><br />There are also a number of contradictions in the film. In an interview, a trainer tells us that Tilikum should not be used as a stud animal due to his aggressive nature. The inference seems to be that Tilikum has a genetic predisposition to aggression. However, throughout the film, it is implied that the aggressive behavior of Tilikum is due to the neurotic tendencies brought about by years of captivity, deprivation and abuse. Which left me somewhat confused. Which is it? Is Tilikum genetically predisposed to these incidents of aggressive and hostile behavior or was it brought on by the environmental factors just mentioned?  Again, I think any reasonable scientist would conclude that we just don't know. Animal behavior is not an exact science. There are no certainties when dealing with animals.<br /><br />Given the unpredictable nature of wild animals, one can readily reach a sound conclusion, via common sense: regardless of whether or not it is ethical to keep Orcas in captivity, it is probably not a good idea to get in the water with a penned-up six-ton Orca. We need OSHA to tell us this? One cannot know with certainty its mental state at all times, and when a six-ton Orca decides to go off, the result isn't going to be pretty. Therefore, regarding the incidents with trainers, I see it as simply the result of the unpredictable nature of a wild animal. If you play with fire, you are eventually going to get burned. Things may go fine 99% of the time, but is that 1%  worth the risk? Apparently a lot of Seaworld trainers believe so.<br /><br />Overall, the film had too much of a preachy undertone to it for my tastes--enough to be a bit irritating at times. Right from the start, the director pulled out the trump card of emotions, as if it was assumed that the audience would be too dumb to figure things out on their own, using just facts and a more tempered approach. It was like we were being told what we should believe, not what we should conclude. The end result appears to come across as an attempt by the director to shame and enrage the viewer into never daring to attend Seaworld ever again.<br /><br />Distinctly absent from the film is any realistic and practical solution to the problem of captive Orcas. Simply calling for an end to captivity and an end to Seaworld makes for a good rally cry but does not represent a practical solution to the issue. What do we do with these animals after the closure? If you simply let them go, they will likely meet a quick death in the wild. There is mention of a 'Sea Pen' for the whales to live out their lives. But who will pay to implement and maintain such a structure? Nobody offers any realistic proposals. The film simply ends.<br /><br />The biggest fault of Blackfish, therefore, is that it represents a shallow play on emotions, a rally cry that falls well short of addressing the really important question -- where do we go from here? Lost in all of the tears and outrage is the fact that when it's all said and done, the Orcas will still remain. Although I sympathize with a good number of the opinions presented in the film, I find it to be at times too naive and short-sighted. It is very effective in casting Seaworld as a villain, but not effective in providing any realistic options for the Orcas -- options that are tenable and practical.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|this was my least favorite dave eggers book. reads like a fable. in parts it seem like he was phoning it in.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|All I can say is that this trilogy is simply and utterly amazing beyond comparison to anything written of the last few years.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|There's nothing more to say, other than that I am sometimes unable to connect to the Internet. This is the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I like Macdormand(?) But mostly liked the flow of fun,games and the sweet ending for a woman who needed help and had the hutzba (?) she had to go for a way to help herself get in to a little bit of hapless fun.
1932100660|4.0|Very informative and helpful when trying to live the healthiest life possible. I think everyone should read this, if they're interested in health...which everyone should be!
B00GH4RKYM|3.0|This is an alright Sunday movie. It goes well with several drinks. However, no amount of vodka can hide the fact that the script is quite lazy. You can think of this movie as a collection of scenes that feel uncomfortable next to each other.
B00E7T8QHY|1.0|This application will download to Kindle Fire HDX and open but that is about all you can do.  There is a bug in software that prevents the chess board from being visible.  The chess pieces are also totally black to the point you can't see pieces on board or even the board squares.  I tried to load this game 2 times on a brand new Kindle Fire HDX 7\\" and the results were the same both times.  I really was hoping game would work because I wanted to purchase the full upgrade with all the chess pieces and chess backgrounds.  There is no way I would spend money when the basic version of game doesn't work.  Developers need to fix this problem if they want to make money.  It's their loss currently!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|This was the only way to connect my audio output to an audio connection for wireless hearing to my hearing aid.
B00C2IPB70|5.0|Steelbook artwork is great!! Also to no surprise the movie is great! It also came with no scratches or dents.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Riveting. Interesting. I could not put this book down It literally opened up to me, in a first person narrative, what it was like to live in Svat Valley, to learn about life under Taliban rule and about Malala and her family.  Inspirational, compelling book.  A must read.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|I am not a game player so my opinion really doesn't count lol I think with time I can do ok
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Now this was a well written, fun, totally engrossing mystery.  Loved it.  I have recommended to so many of my friends and they felt the same way. Totally enable book.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|Don't really care for the quality of the appearance of the pictures. and its not rear facing so hard to take pictures
B00BRUPICM|2.0|I had high hopes, with such great reviews,  but my hopes quickly plummeted the more I got into the book..  I could not even finish the book. So disappointing since I love mysteries and crime novels.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|Would love it but I cant open it unless got WiFi.  Wish that I didn't need WiFi to open it.
B000KIE11Q|4.0|The product is very good and I am very happy with it, i would recommend it for purchase, but when i recieved the box it seem to be open
B007FROGME|5.0|This is a great book very bleak at times but I love a book that keeps you guessing I did not see the end coming!
0823023494|5.0|this book is great for those starting in animation. The reading is like a middle school level and easy to read. Also, the how to's make it easy to draw a character. Unique. Inspiring. Easy
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|This next book in the series is just as good I could not put it down .<br />Never a dull moment you will love it!
086547897X|5.0|I love this book. This book is the must have for animators. They teach you the steps from how to start to complicated movements.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I could not put this book down and as soon as I finished it got the next book!a must read
0307352153|5.0|A very well written and researched book, yes, but more than that, the topic itself I could not agree with more. Susan Cain does a very intelligent write up on how introverts contribute in a big way to society, and are often the people who really bring about most of the change and innovation we see in society. I also liked her research about what do the best engineers have in common. Is it age, or education, or upbringing, or something else ? The result was interesting. They all worked in companies where they got a lot of quiet time to think on their own; companies that respected the intelligence of the engineers and allowed them as much quiet time to think as they needed. To me, that is brilliant, and a big thumbs up to the value of introversion.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This absolutely one of the best books I have ever read. R. J. Palacio does a great job at giving each character a different personality and point of view throughout the book. She is also great at changing the feeling of the reader. There is a roller coaster of emotions. The book is in separate parts. Each part is a new character and it talks about there point of view of what is going on in the story at that time.<br />  The chapters are very short and not numbered. But, each one is very descriptive and interesting. I had a hard time putting this book down because of all the different and descriptive parts.<br />  Now you are probably wondering what Wonder is about. It is a about a 5th grade boy named August. He is not an ordinary kid on the outside but a smart and loving one on the inside. The whole story is about how August is treated by his strange looks and how other people are effected by it. He goes to school for the first time in his life. At first people thing he is weird and strange. Then people start to see the real August and how awesome he is! There is many struggles that August and the other character goes through in each part of the book.<br />  This is a must read for everyone! I totally recommend it! You will be on the edge of your seat with this Beautiful, Amazing, and heart warming story!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I LOVE this game. I am only in Wrb1 but hey it is the best game ever. I think they should remove the limits of fights.
B003UESJH4|5.0|What's not to like? Colin Firth is fantastic, Geoffrey Rush is fantastic, and even the usually bizarre Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic. The movie deservedly won Best Picture and Best Movie (in addition to other Oscars).<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B009POHHR6|5.0|I'm not usually a reader of superman. I'm usually a batman guy but wow. This story was excellent. The twist at the end was awesome. The art was good to great. I def recommend.
B0009X7664|5.0|Probably the best movie ever made.  They did an amazing job of evoking a feeling and an era that seamlessly matches that of the book.  That they succeeded in a film with child actors makes it that much more admirable.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies I could watch every day and never get tired of it.
B00D3NSDVO|2.0|Could not get started. Very Hollywood. Same old stunted characters. Absurd violence. Silly writing. Im putting it down. There's a LeCarre quote at the beginning. HA!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was awesome book. I loved it. It was one of the greatest books ever. That's just my opinion. I'm in 5th grade, too. GO AUGUST.
B0031Y9DCS|4.0|I first read Chickenhawk when it first came out and I find over the years it has held up reasonably well. As a teenager in  Cedar Rapids Iowa where they made the electronics for the Huey, I remember Collins bringing in a couple of Huey's and the public getting a chance to see them and an army video showing them in action. As a 14 year old I thought the best thing would be a warrant flying Huey's in Nam. This book always reminds me why it was better for me that opportunity did not work out. Mason's real life experience serving in Vietnam are told in a very concise and vivid way. His book was one of the first to bring that from line battle experience to a book form versus what we had seen every night on the news.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is a challenge especially if you do not purchase the coins and lives and such trying to do it without the extras is challenging, I love it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book grabbed me from the first page.  It was a page turner.  You really feel this family's pain and the struggle they are going through.  It keeps you guessing til the very end. Love the courtroom drama.  A definite &#34;must read&#34;.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this book in less than one week. Many sleepless nights..... it's that good. Can't wait to read the next one. I love that it has more class than 50 shades of grey but still very sexy.
0763660531|5.0|This book is about a girl who goes on an adventure that she has never been on before.  She is bored because no one will play with her. So, she uses a red crayon to draw the things that she imagines, and as she draws them, they become real.  Sometimes she sees beautiful places, but sometimes she has to get herself out of danger!  My favorite part was when her new friend helped her escape from the bad guys. I also like how it has a nice surprise ending.<br />If you pay attention on the cover, you will see that the illustrator IS the author... because there are no words in this book.  The pictures tell the story.  I think any kid would like this book because the pictures are so good, and even kids who can't read words, can read this story.  Even kids who speak other languages could enjoy the story!<br />I rate this book 5 stars, because it was so great!<br />Review by Bea L., age 5, Oregon Mensa
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Great series.  I was hooked after episode one.  I clicked on it on a whim and couldn't stop watching it.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|I think its a fine product but it did not fix my ongoing kindle problem and now i need a new kindle after less that 2 years of use.  I implied that i woul like to get it repaired and custumer service went straight into replacement, not even a thought to repairment.
0307932427|5.0|This is the best comprehensive history book that I've listened to.  The author covers human history in a way that is easy to follow and interesting.  He does spend a bit too much time talking about Papua New Guinea (he spent a great deal of time there apparently), but overall I enjoyed the book.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game for all ages fun adventure with all the ponies you know in love I love this game so try and withese amazing traffics and mini games you will tooo
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|There were many elements in this book that tested my willingness to suspend disbelief. In the end, it felt like a tech fable, wrapped in a parable about freedom, and coated with a bit of mystery. I admired the extent to which Eggers showed the results of certain concepts taken to their extremes, but wish he had explored more gray areas. That said, it's a fun read!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love it!  I just finished Breaking Bad and was looking for a new show.  This is amazing.  The casting is amazing!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game...just wish I didn't have to log on to face book to ask my friends for help when I'm stuck on a level. I also don't like games that require me to spend money to get to the next level. Besides that,  this game is great &amp; very addictive!
0385537131|3.0|The book did not grab me like most of Mr Grisham's previous books.  It just trudged along with little or no excitement.  About two-thirds of the was through, the ending became predictable.  Just didn't pull me in like most of his books have.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|When the fantastic writing team of Preston & Child hinted there would be a Sherlock Holmes element to their latest book &#34;White Fire&#34; I was very excited and intrigued. Needless to say when this book came out it usurped all the other books I was reading and went straight to the top of the pile. Starting slightly different from their other Pendergast novels, this one begins with Pendergast's prot&eacute;g&eacute; Corrie Swanson traveling to a small town in Colorado to research an old case of a man-eating grizzly bear during the town's silver boom heyday. She gets in over her head and soon Pendergast arrives to help her out. Oh how I love when he puts nasty, rude people in their place! When I was unable to read this book I was trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together. I hope we can see more Corrie/ Pendergast cases in the future for this book was excellent. The only bad side to reading Preston/Child books is waiting for the next one.

B006H5120E|5.0|It took me all my life but it was a delight watching this movie. I never saw it before and what a movie I found.  One can´t understand  this was originally a 2D masterpiece.  3D fits perfectly here.  The only downside is having it divided into two discs.  I felt like watching an old laser disc that needed a short break to change sides. Other than that, highly recommended.
B0082RXQMC|5.0|Very enjoyable to read. I never read P&P but I've seen a PBS TV version and film and it was interesting to imagine the continuation of the story.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Impeccable.  A journey to the beginning of the saga.  It fits perfectly and give us lots of great, rich, deep, colorfull scenes.  Another 3D must have.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Another exciting book by James Rollins with believable characters and intriguing plot. I love this author because he puts truth in his books along with fiction. Most people live in fantasy land and believe life is about getting new toys. They have to wake up and pay attention  because their lives and way of living are in extreme danger. There is a powerful group -Elite, Cabal, Illuminati- that have plans to reduce the world's population and control all the World. Start researching them. Make up your own mind.
B00004R7PB|5.0|This just can't be bettered. Beautifully recorded, Savall and his period orchestra avoid the overly saccharine readings often associated with modern orchestras in these pieces, while at the same time avoiding the hard-pressed, nervous tempos that sometimes ruin period readings. Everything just sounds as right as it can be.

1451666179|5.0|There are a few times you run across a blog that makes you LOL and Allie's is one of those.  I have read her blog, laughed so hard, and recommended it to family and friends.  It was painful to read (watch) her go through depression but she is just so honest that you cannot feel anything but empathy and wonder at her honesty.  I forgot I had pre-ordered the book before she took her long hiatus so it was like Christmas morning for me to find it sitting on my porch.  She includes some of her blog entries (my favorites!) but also new material.  She is a true talent!  If you like off the wall humor, you'll love Hyperbole and a Half!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I thought there great action and I love the new aliens but wish there was more of them in this  movie..................................
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Don't expect to find the \\"secret\\" as you read the first chapters. Grisham weaves a carefully constructed plot. In this case focused upon Mississippi and a lawyer we met before, now facing a new challenge. How does a suicide reveal so much about people and their culture? Does justice trump racism? Frankly, once I read the first few pages, I was in for a marathon read, every moment worth the effort. Enjoy!
B00GOQ9M4O|2.0|Yep, the dumbest females characters yet! How can they have survived this long without knowing how to kill a zombie. Really? Really!!! Oh, and the tripping scene, because everyone knows a female running from a zombie must trip. Let the freaking Governor trip if you want a tripping scene, but I guess men never trip. The dialog sucks too. The little girl never speaks, then starts to speak and nobody notices. The writer and editor of this episode needs to be fired -- period. What a waste!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game. Game play is quick and challenging. Like urban Temple Run. It fast paced and the power ups are good
B00BTLSURE|5.0|This CD is beautiful. The tracks flow right into each other, and the music is uplifting and pleasant, and almost inspiring. Its a great to have such music.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Painfully peeling away the false sacrin Disneyfied layers we have painted for ourselves on top of Reality (synonymous with Truth and Beauty), Donna Tartt takes on the big questions.<br />First rule of restoration: do nothing that can't be undone. She carefully strips away our comfortable false constructions and lets us see this old world of ours for what it is.<br />This is beautifully written. Artfully told.  Warm and with a certain humor and great adventure.<br />Besides all of this good stuff of which great novels are made, there is also the world of the underground art trade AND furniture restoration!!!! Perfection!

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I expected so much more from this novel, and the double-first-person perspective really made this book weird.  Why are we hearing from Four's perspective only now?  Why not in the first two novels?  And how confusing it is to have &#34;I&#34; be both Four and Tris...sometimes I'd have to go back and see who is talking!  Not to mention Veronica Roth sucks at writing men!  Bottom line, this book doesn't work, and what was once an &#34;action&#34; book/series becomes...well...boring.  If I hadn't read the other two books, I never would've read this one.  Total crap, and everyone else who has made it through this crap novel mostly agrees.

B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you love historical pieces like Downton Abbey, you'll love this BBC series (who also stars Brendan Coyle).  The stories are rich and the themes timeless.  This is sort of a grown up Little House On The Prairie for Brits.  Well done!

B00G4I1CLS|5.0|I saw Tilikum perform at Sea World in Orlando about 10 years ago and although I wasn't exactly comfortable watching the performance, I had no idea what was really going on behind the scenes. Sea World is not what I thought it was. This is a well made documentary that will open your eyes to the truth behind how orca whales live in captivity.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price, I cannot complain at all... it works MUCH better than that piece of crap Samsung HomeSync and it's only a tenth the price! Unfortunately, it only streams from Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, Google Play Movies, and Google Play Music. It won't stream existing videos on your phone or from your network, so if you're getting it for that, don't bother. I have a couple of TVs that aren't &#34;smart&#34; and I've watched a few Netflix and a couple of YouTube videos on my 60&#34; plasma, it looked fine and the sound was good. Setup was too simple with absolutely no challenge, boring, but a good thing! I plugged it into the HDMI and used the USB on the TV so it doesn't have to stay on 24/7. It popped up with a URL to go to, I went, it found the ChromeCast, it set it up, I didn't even have to find my wireless password, totally lazy... you control it with your crApple (I think), Android phone/tablet/laptop, or Google Chrome browser. I just ordered another &#34;idiot box&#34; and will likely get another ChromeCast... in fact, I'll order it while I'm here.

B00821OX98|5.0|I found this season to be wildly entertaining.  The characters are interesting and I can follow why the characters make their decisions in the way they do. Wish it was on DVD/Blue Ray
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Man of Steel follows Henry Cavill's Clark Kent as he struggles to find his place in a world that's not his own - with the character's existential musings interrupted by the arrival of a vicious Kryptonian warlord (Michael Shannon's Zod) bent on world domination. There's little doubt that Man of Steel gets off to a less-than-promising start, as filmmaker Zack Snyder, working from David S. Goyer's screenplay, opens the movie with a tedious stretch set on Superman's dying home planet of Krypton - with the overuse of computer-generated effects lending such scenes a derivative and surprisingly campy feel (ie if Avatar had been incompetent and terrible, it might've resembled this). The movie does, however, improve considerably once the action shifts to Earth, with the time-shifting script ensuring that the emphasis on the central character's early days rarely fares as poorly as one might've feared (ie Snyder and Goyer wisely skip over some of the more familiar aspects of Clark/Superman's origin story). Man of Steel's completely watchable atmosphere is heightened by its proliferation of impressive performances, with Cavill's strong work as the title figure matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Costner. (The latter's engrossing turn as Clark's adoptive father stands as an obvious highlight within the proceedings.) It's only as Zod (re)enters the picture that one's interest begins to slowly-but-surely dip, as the film's final hour is devoted entirely to the epic battle between Zod and Superman - with the ineffectiveness of this stretch (ie it's like watching someone else play a poorly-rendered video game) compounded by Snyder's inept directorial choices (ie the shaky camerawork renders the majority of this stuff incoherent). The endless third act ultimately transforms Man of Steel into a disappointing (and surprisingly second-rate) piece of work, with the movie's lack of magic or wonder standing in sharp contrast to the previous portrayals of this iconic character (ie Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is looking positively masterful by comparison).
B00FPH51LQ|3.0|I've never seen a movie rip off so many other movies and get away with it. The main characters are Jeff Bridges playing Rooster Cogburn from True Grit, and what's his name, playing his unmemorable self. It starts out like a scene from Beetlejuice, then turns into Men In Black. The funny thing is it pulls it off fairly well. There is some funny moments, when you see what the characters look like to the living, and some good action sequences with good special effects. It is certainly not original by any stretch of the imagination.
B004SUDQE0|5.0|FUN FUN FUN FUN.  AMUSING TO KNOW THAT THIS IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. I wish this was Closed Caption for several of my family has hearing challenges but this is still a fun family movie
B005K17RU0|5.0|I can check the weather anytime day or night.  It is easy to use and set up for where you live or where you may be going.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|We adore this series.  The ending was needed because you can only take the story so far but Seasons 1 and 2 are still our favourites.  This is a great series the 5th season is the darkest as far as theme as is to be expected.  Loved the last scene. A great surprise.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This game has no car damage and when you finish the race they have no service repair AND it's not likely real racing 3 but it's like pgm 3 on the Xbox 360 but it's a good game but gameloft did it again and its free too

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Special Agent Pendergast is the best detective since Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot... anyone who loves him will love Agent Pendergast's attention to details and his grey cells of the brain working overtime...

B00FEMJF6O|3.0|Happy it's finally here on kindle. Just started...a little slow but I will let you know. Some more special priced bundles would be great!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Another great read. It takes while to sort out who the characters are and their relationships with each other but it all comes clear at the end. Not quite up to the emotional marke of the Kite Runner.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Cute game with cute good graphics. Daughter loves to play and I play on Facebook too. Easy quests and they are easy to complete. Nice to pass the time with.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It was an exellent novel.  The sad thing is that horrific tragedy happened all too frequently in the days Blacks were treated like they were less than human.  I thought it would just be another book battling over a will left by an eccentric old man.  Not so--Grisham is good for surprise endings and this was no exception.  It was great and I recommend it to anyone!
B0081BU42O|5.0|I cannot believe Iain passed away. He was one the most prominent Science-Fiction writer. His Culture series are just... I'm at a loss to describe the emptiness left by his departure to other systems and bigger adventures.<br />I'll miss Iain's future stories.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an entertaining read. A focused concept well executed. I felt that some parts could have been more fleshed out but leaving them out left the book as more of an action series instead of a treatise on the human condition.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|This book kept me on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and on the edge of my seat suspense.  I found myself staying up late so I could find out what was going to happen next.  As usual Lincoln & Child did it again with this nonstop page - turner.  Made me want to go back and read some of Sherlock Holmes books.  I love the Pendergast series, by far this was the best!

0060555661|5.0|Wonderful book, a really great starting point if you want to learn all there is. Should be a must read for anyone that wants to invest even online on your own; or for all high school/college students  Very practical, lots of real life examples and comparisons, over many market cycles.  Explains all the terms your hear on the radio, commentary shows, etc.  Also points you to lots of resources that you can use yourself in your own investing strategy. The original version was written many years ago, but this book has the authors added, updated the examples, and comments for how the stock market reacted over many Bulls and bears.  His disciples have continued to share the perspective on his insights and recommendation in this book, and in commentary chapters, since he passed.  You learn so much.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book was depressing though. I really want to cry I wanted and thought the book would have a happy ending and it didn't. I felt Tobias pain when you lose someone you really can't live without. I didn't want that to happened. It was really sad.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|A fascinating book and a quick, easy read. Don't expect complex characters or deep analysis of the human soul; the villains and protagonists are generally like comic book characters, one dimensional, some archetypal. Social media in this world has gone awry as a fictional company, The Circle, becomes something like a monopolistic combination of Google, Facebook, Twitter, PayPal and, ultimately, the NSA, tracking billions of users who surrender their privacy to its search capabilities and social media, which have spread their tentacles to become a global force with a sinister ambition, in effect to control the world. There are to be no secrets in this world, no privacy, no living life alone. This soon takes on terrifying dimensions as the Circle's plans for national and even global domination become clearer. It's a creepy world, where most of the characters are nearly zombie-like in their total cultish love for and subservience to the Circle. Some of this reads almost like parody and certainly strains our credulity, though there's no doubt this was intentional on Eggers' part. Read it for its breathless pace, excellent writing and its relevance as we see Google and Facebook extend their reach into our lives and read our minds through their tracking technology. Well worth the $5 I payed for the Kindle version.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool but vetor' s battle is so hard that every time I go there I lose can you change the game and remove vetor' s and let it be like temple run please can you do that but that is the only thing you can and the rest is great.

B00F8OUBXE|5.0|Best metal album in 2013. I was hesitant to buy it but then I was caught when I started playing it.  This is a true continuation of The Dark album back in 1986.  I also enjoyed Blessing in Disguise from 1989 and Human Factor in 1991, although not quite the same original sound as earlier works.  Generation Nothing goes back to where MC origins.<br /><br />Lot of good songs and hard to pick one as favorite.  Tunes as &#34;Suiciety&#34; and &#34;Scream&#34; are very good, &#34;Generation Nothing&#34; and &#34;Media Horse&#34; are also outstanding.

055358894X|4.0|Good, edgy fantasy is hard to come by but there have been a number of series appear in the last decade or two that are of very high quality -- especially those by Joe Abercrombie and Robin Hobb. Now we can add Scott Lynch to that list.<br /><br />The city-state of Camorr is one of the surviving, and thriving, fragments of the old Therin Empire (about which you will gradually learn a good deal as the story progresses) and the legitimate side of things is run by the Duke and his government. The underside of the city, though, belongs to the Capa, to whom all the leaders of the gangs must answer. Locke Lamora, now in his twenties, is the boss of a very small gang, the Gentleman Bastards, and their specialty is con games, rather than burglary or picking pockets. In alternating chapters, we learn how Locke and his friends were selected and trained by a very unusual priest, and then how they are presently applying what they learned to become filthy, but secretly, rich. The gang members include the Sanza twins, a little older that Locke, who are expert at slight of hand and at carrying out their leader's plans. The extraordinarily loyal Jean Tannin provides the muscle and the more intellectual side of the group. And bug, the youngest, is a talented lookout, though he has a habit of taking extreme personal risks without much forethought.<br /><br />The gang has been slowly, carefully setting up a moderately wealthy couple among the lesser nobility and are now running their game at full tilt. But they don't know that Capa Barsavi is about to be conned himself, by an outsider called the Grey King, who wants revenge for an old crime, and that the Gentleman Bastards are about to be caught in the middle. Locke has a knack for getting himself nearly killed, though Jean usually manages to save him. But maybe not this time.<br /><br />Even though this is his first novel, Lynch does an excellent job of building the characters and setting the scene -- the city becomes almost a character in itself -- and his action scenes are excellent. The narrative could be a little tighter, but the plot holds together well, especially when Locke is called upon to improvise. There are two additional volumes out now and I shall be hunting them down.er in itself -- and his action scenes are excellent.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This is a really fun, free game.  The updates make it a little buggy but overall a great game with good customer support when you send in a question.  Game is free but they do have in-game purchasing.  While they encourage you to purchase it is not needed and you can be successful without.  This is massively multi-player.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this app. And it is addictive. I've only had one problem with the app since installing it on my kindle fire, but overall it's pretty cool. I don't like waiting for lives or the fact that my heart (to hold the lives) never increases to hold more lives or that it takes 30 minutes just to get ONE life. I know I'm a bit impatient, but I would enjoy playing this more if I didn't have to wait (or pay) for lives.

B00GH4RKYM|2.0|I know I'm late to the table, but I've finally seen the film and, though my opinion means little to mostly no one but myself, I'll share it here. The very premise of a \\"Superman\\" is in itself absurd, as it should be, because it comes from a 1939 comic book: an infant from a dying world rocketted to Earth where, due to its atmosphere and his alien physiology, he becomes a superior being in every way--mind, body, and apparently soul. Fantastical, and its being fantastical is Man of Steel's most unforgivable flaw: it takes itself too seriously. Add to that its being visually, intellectually, and emotionally underwhelming, and what you have is--at least for me--a cinematic disappointment on the level of The Dark Knight Rises. Another issue I had with Snyder's effort is its lackluster depiction of what is crucial to the Superman mythos: Flight. In the best movies about him, and the best comics, directors, writers and artists have spent much energy focused on Superman's flight--Ross's illustrations often show him as hovering majestically above it all, above the mortals, above the humans, who are beneath him. Other examples are Donner's Superman and Singer's Superman Returns; Singer made a point of making certain his Superman was a master of the skies; and who can forget Donner's vision of Kal-El gliding effortlessly through space, fulfilling the promise, \\"You will believe a man can fly\\"? Such focus, such attention to detail is hardly found in Snyder's Man of Steel; aesthetically speaking, it's as if Superman's flight were a mere afterthought. Only in a few scenes is it handled with any care (floating above the Army before surrendering to the general); otherwise his flying is a slapdash glimpse quickly forgotten. The film also has quite a few lapses in logic, which is a problem when its creators want us to take the story more seriously than if it were presented in a comic book. [Spoiler alert! If you haven't seen the film, you may want to stop reading this--you're still here? still reading? then you mustn't care or have already seen the movie.] Lapses in logic: It took Kal-El--or Clark--thirty-three years to master his powers, and even then he hadn't fully mastered them, but Zod and his army come close to mastering theirs in a couple hours? Also: Why would Kal-El reveal the secret to controlling his powers to Zod? Why would he give away his tactical advantage? Near the end of the film, Zod uses his heat vision to attack civilians; the dual beams come close to reaching them but are stopped by Superman, which is ridiculous: The heat radiating from those beams should've obliterated the civilians before anything could've been done to stop them. In thirty-three years, Clark never knew he could fly? never even tried to fly? never had reason to? Nonsense. And lastly, a Superman is revealed to have been living on Earth, in the United States, for decades; once he reveals himself, and has contact with the military, at no point does the President of the United States communicate with him? Only a field general?

0316055433|5.0|This is a book about the life's journey of a young boy dealing with the aftermath of his mother's sudden - and violent - death.With a wonderful ability to keep you turning the pages, Donna Tartt elicits many gut-wrenching emotions from the reader. It's not easy to read about someone coming to grips with the idea that the one person in their life they could depend on is gone forever. However, it is also a story of getting on with things... and the finding of hope and love in unexpected places.<br />Don't be put off by the size of the book. You'll hardly notice the pages turning and you may find yourself delaying finishing just so that there is some more to read the next day. She only writes a book a decade, so take it slow and enjoy the ride. A book like this is a rare and wonderful treat.

B001ANYDAO|3.0|Well written, entertaining, and provocative. Two problems: Obviously the author selected certain situations that fit his premise... there are tons of folks who succeed who do not come close to fitting his model; and while the first half of the book moves briskly, the second half slows to a crawl. The entire book could have been written in 1/3 the space. That said, it's still a very worthwhile read because of the fresh perspective.
B00CCXL9OE|4.0|In case any of you are confused about this, as of the time of this writing there is no Blu-Ray version of Aladdin officially released in the U.S., despite the posting in the Blu-Ray guide of Lady and the Tramp that Aladdin was to be released in the Diamond Collection in &#34;Spring 2013.&#34;  According to Wikipedia,<br /><br />&#34;According to an insert in the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition release case, Aladdin was going released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition in Spring 2013.[65] Instead, Peter Pan was released on Blu-ray as a Diamond Edition in February 5, 2013 to celebrate its 60th Anniversary.[66][67] A new Diamond Edition release of Aladdin has not been announced since. A non-Diamond Edition Blu-ray was released in a few select European countries in March 2013. The Belgian edition (released without advertisements, commercials or any kind of fanfare) comes as a 1-disc version with its extras ported over from the Platinum Edition DVD). The same disc will be released in the United Kingdom on 14 April 2013.&#34;<br /><br />Now, you may be thinking, &#34;If it hasn't been released in the U.S. then I can't watch it in the U.S., then I can't watch it on a U.S. Blu-Ray player.&#34;  In response to that, I again quote Wikipedia:<br /><br />&#34;As with the implementation of region codes for DVDs, Blu-ray Disc players sold in a specific geographical region are designed to play only discs authorized by the content provider for that region. This is intended to permit content providers (motion picture studios, etc.) to do effective price differentiation between regions. According to the Blu-ray Disc Association, &#34;all Blu-ray Disc players...(and) Blu-ray Disc-equipped computer systems are required to support regional coding.&#34; However, &#34;Use of region playback codes is optional for content providers...&#34;[144] Some current estimates suggest 70% of available [movie] Blu-ray Discs from the major studios are region-code-free and can therefore be played on anyBlu-ray Disc player, in any region.[145]&#34;<br /><br />The majority of current Disney Blu-Rays are among these &#34;Region-Free&#34; Blu-Ray discs, including the U.K. Aladdin release I am reviewing here.  In case you're wondering how to tell, the Wikipedia article goes on to list the Blu-Ray region codes:<br /><br />Region code Area<br />A Includes most North, Central, and South American and Southeast Asian countries plus Taiwan, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Korea.<br />B Includes most European, African, and Southwest Asian countries plus Australia and New Zealand.<br />C Includes the remaining central and south Asian countries, as well as China and Russia.<br /><br />Each of these region codes is represented by the letter in bold type surrounded by a hexagon, usually on the back of the case.  A region-code-free Blu-Ray shows all three region code symbols in a three-celled honeycomb pattern.<br /><br />Anyway, now that that's cleared up, I would say that the U.K. release of Aladdin is OK, but not the best ever as far as Blu-Ray transfers are concerned.  The picture is crisp with vibrant colors and excellent sound, but the other (American) Blu-Ray releases I have are noticeably better.  However, this Aladdin release on Blu-Ray is still excellent as far as it goes, a beautiful example of Blu-Ray technology--just don't expect full Diamond Collection quality.<br /><br />Now, I never had the opportunity to get the DVD release of the movie, so I can't be taken too seriously on this, but in comparison to the picture and sound quality of Disney DVD releases of other movies, I'd say that this Blu-Ray release of Aladdin goes way beyond what DVDs are capable of, but doesn't quite take advantage of the full potential of the format because of its hasty release, but it still is 100% Disney quality, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know.<br /><br />Summary:<br />-Compatibility with U.S. Blu-Ray players: 5/5<br />-Video Transfer Quality: 4/5<br />-Audio Transfer Quality: 4.5/5<br />-Extras: 3/5
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|The songs are similar to the old Eminem with less of the angry Eminem.  My faves are &#34;So Far...&#34;, &#34;Berzerk&#34; and the pinnacle: &#34;Rap God&#34;.  There are already plenty of long reviews to read, so read those.

B005H9B2CE|5.0|First time I watched THOR I thought it was OK, but the thing is I have watched THOR around 6 times since and I can't remember when I have ever done that with another film.  I really believe this movie will last the test of time and become a classic, way more loved and appreciated in the future than ever it was at it's release.

B0044XV3QY|4.0|I think we all know and love Avatar, for its deeply immersive setting, despite the overused plot formula.  Shortly after watching the movie in theaters, I and some friends were discussing the movie, and when the simplicity of the plot was brought up, one guy (who hadn't even seen the movie) managed to sum up the plot in three short phrases: &#34;Guy is sent into enemy base; Guy falls in love; Guy rebels against his own people,&#34; and I told him that was exactly how it happened.<br /><br />What a summary of the plot cannot capture, though, is the rich detail in the story and setting of the film, which manages to outshine the clumsy dialogue and simple plot.  It was apparent to me, after watching the film, that there is so much more to the story than was portrayed in the theatrical cut.  My uncle and I had discussed Jake and Neytiri's love scene with the same perspective: with such an efficient system of telepathy as Ze-Halu (I am probably spelling it wrong), why would they not use it on each other during their most intimate moment together?  As it turned out, before the editors clipped around the edges of the scene, Jake and Neytiri did use 'the Bond' before making love.<br /><br />There was a lot more to the original opening, and the theatrical release skipped all but a couple of references to Grace Augustine's school for English, which actually had significant scenes dedicated just to it.<br /><br />Yes, there were a couple of scenes that seriously could have been left out of even the extended release, especially one in particular near the end, which just made it drag.  I couldn't even make out most of what the characters said in that scene.  Those you just have to deal with if you want to watch the extended release.<br /><br />However, overall the &#34;Collector's Extended&#34; release actually makes the movie experience that much more believable.  With the extended version, you actually get a sense of TIME.  You actually begin to have more sympathy with the characters because you get to find out about their pasts.  Several formerly shortened or phased scenes now present a more accurate sense of time and personality than they did before, the love scene and the numerous hunting scenes as well.<br /><br />If it weren't for that one irritating scene (another review provides more detailed spoilers on the extended scenes if you care to read them), I would have rated this extended release five stars, but I can't forgive that one dragging burr in an otherwise rich and crisp release.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Video: 4.5/5 (not all transitions were completely professional between theatrical and extended scenes)<br />Audio: 5/5<br />Extended Scenes: 4.5/5 (one scene added back in was a thorn in my paw)<br />Overall: 4.5/5
B002Q4TKAY|5.0|Fantastic CD of live songs from the band, recorded with great clarity and the song selections is perfect in my humble opinion.

B00A0MJA1I|3.0|I've always loved classic Disney films, and Peter Pan was always one of my favorites, so when I saw a Blu-Ray version on Amazon after years of having to do without ANY classic Disney film save for Snow White, due to the mysterious disappearance of 90% of our Disney films collection following the passing of my grandmother, I just had to get it.<br /><br />When I first watched it, I found myself disappointed.  The disc menu was obnoxious and overly dramatic, but I didn't mind that as much since the Platinum Edition of Snow White had already proven to me years before that Disney can make pretty awful disc menus on otherwise beautiful movie releases (a disc menu that instructs you on navigating a disc menu, REALLY?).<br /><br />So I started the movie anyway, and was impressed by the beautiful transfer of the video and audio of the film, for it took full advantage of the abilities of Blu-Ray technology to create an unsurpassed experience of this classic--until I had to pause the movie.<br /><br />The &#34;Disney Intermission&#34; feature tampers with something that is considered a given with watching movies at home--occasionally you have to pause the movie to use the bathroom or discuss the meaning of a scene.  When you try to do that on the Blu-Ray version of Peter Pan, suddenly you get this loudly ticking clock icon on the screen for about 5-15 seconds, followed by a looping music video.  While the video loop itself can be paused so you don't have to listen to it while trying to discuss the movie, it means you have to press pause twice, with several seconds between each press, then you have to press play and a different button just to get back to the movie.  While I'm not going to get rid of the movie just because the configuration is frustrating, Peter Pan has made it to the bottom of my list of Disney movies to re-watch next, because of the [expletive] Disney Intermission.<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />-Video Quality: 5/5<br />-Audio Quality: 5/5<br />-Bonus Features: 4/5<br />-Disc Menu: obnoxious<br />-Disney Intermission: Deal-Breaker.
B00GHJ6BJW|3.0|Really hard to review this album. Some of it is genius and displays Gaga's finely honed pop sensibilities perfectly. Then some of it is just bad lyrics and overly produced. I mean &#34;Uranus! Don't you know my ass is famous&#34;? C'mon.<br />On balance though, worth a listen as some of it is excellent.
0316055433|2.0|I may be the only person on Amazon who didn't like this book.  I slogged my way through the entire 800 pages, but my only feeling for the lead character was, &#34;eh?&#34;  Who cares?  DonnaTartt has written a protagonist with almost no redeeming characteristics:  he's a drug addict, an alcoholic and totally without heart or empathy.  I found it interesting that near the end of the book he says that his fiancé showed no feeling for anyone, yet he was the most self-absorbed, hollow character that I've read in a long time.<br /><br />As everyone else says, the writing is amazing and evocative and beautiful.  If Donna Tartt could only have engaged my sympathy, empathy, compassion for Theo, I would have liked the book.  As it is, Theo was, for me, so self-involved and shallow that I simply could not like the book.
B007TK77QE|1.0|rowling needs to stick to writing for teenagers.  This book is all about teenages angst.  Hasn't decided if she is writing for adults yet or still stuck in the Harry Potter age group.  All in all, quite pathetci

0375850864|4.0|An intelligent GP (general patronage) read for middle-grade kids and up (including adults).  This is a cleverly-plotted story about growing up in NY in the late '70s/ early '80s, and delves with topic and issues like time travel, racism, personal space, other-centeredness, and hope.  The storyline creates just enough reasonable doubt to challenge the linearity of time, enough to stimulate one's imagination and creativity.  In the same manner that &#34;A Wrinkle in Time&#34; provided the author with the idea and the inspiration to pen this award-winning book, I have no doubt that after reading this story, middle-graders nowadays will also be inspired to dabble a little bit with creative writing, which is a rarity in this generation's fascination with the undead and dystopian societies.  Very much recommended for kids 11 and up.  In fact, this should be in 5th/6th grade reading lists (if it isn't already).
B00A2H9PLG|4.0|Like others have said this is a modern day Die Hard.  A very good movie that entertained me.  I usually don't get hung up in the details or plot holes but there is one thing about this movie that really bothered me.  It was the ending!  How can you trace the number of someone that beeped you?  I guess kids today don't understand how beepers work.  You dial the beeper number and then dial the number you want them to see on the beeper screen.  There is no way to take the beeper and see who called the beeper number.  The ending of the movie let me cold but I really enjoyed the movie up until that point.  I still think this movie was worth watching and give it 4 stars (which is a lot for me).
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Love this game my only issue was having menu button right were I left my hand resting while playing kept hitting it by mistake.  I also like a map it was a little trying to get to where I needed to go.  But I love the challenge this game brought.  The games were the best I have played and would set for hours keep them coming!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|The premise of this book is thought provoking.  As I read it, I was constantly challenged to question what I would do if I were &#34;brainwashed&#34; in a similar fashion.  For me, the true test of this book is that I've thought about it for weeks afterward.  Every time I see news about someone on Facebook or Twitter, I shudder.  And I guess that was the point of the book - being so totally connected socially, results in personal alienation.  It's not the best book I've read on a future with big brother watching everything we do, but it was very interesting.
0399255370|1.0|I found this book to be negative and all the crayons did was complain, Im quite shocked to see so many 5 star reviews. The book is very immature and models negative behavior.

B004RKXHZY|5.0|I read Anna and the French Kiss last year and it was quite a decent read. It didn’t work for me that well then, but now, a year and a little more later, I realize that it was actually a very good book. I just didn’t know how to appreciate it back then and I guess my feelings and values on reading books have changed a little over time. When I pulled a paper slip of Lola and the Boy Next Door out of my paper slip jar, I was over the moon about it and boyyyy was I not disappointed.<br /><br />“I know you aren't perfect. But it's a person's imperfections that make them perfect for someone else.”<br /><br />I don’t even want to start discussing the eccentric, lively girl that is Lola, because I think everyone should discover her by themselves ;) As for other characters, I loved Cricket. I mean, come on?! I’ve never had a boy next door. I’ve always had girls (that way I met one of my best friends) and old ladies or just friendly neighbors, but no boys. I wish I had someone like Cricket living next to me. He’s just.. made of all things wonderful! The way he is described is very nerdy and sweet. I was a huge bad boy fangirl once and in ways I still am, but I’ve become to appreciate sweet guys more and more. Cricket Bell was a brilliant character and I believe that any girl would be lucky to have him as a brother, friend, lover – whichever it would be.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the parental issues in this one and the little that was talked about gay couples since Lola has two dads who did a way better job with raising her than her mom ever could have. Speaking of, her mom was present in the book as well, but at first she rubbed Lola completely the wrong way and caused more trouble than any good. After some time, they grew closer, but it was a tough journey for our girl. Also, when I read the final part of the thank you note by Stephanie Perkins, I had a HUGE smile on my face because it was perfect! I love how she combined these sweet and precious moments of her life into this novel and it shows how a great author can combine the happenings of one’s life into a novel and make them one’s own yet again. This was the perfect example of being inspired by real life experiences and combining them into the author's work. Take notes, people!<br /><br />I am so glad I picked this out of those random paper slips I made for all my unread paperbacks/hardcovers and I can’t wait to see what I’ll pick next! I hope it’s that good. When I finished Lola the next morning after I started reading it, I felt so good and had this feeling that I could accomplish anything. It’s just one of those books that makes you feel and think and.. just makes you happy in general. Makes you inspired! It was perfect! One more thing, do you think it’s too early to do a re-read? ;)

B00FPGSPQU|3.0|This episode has a new plot but the characters and type of situations they face are the same.  I admit that it might be a good time to hang up the franchise before it gets stale, but I was amused enough to go around the merry go round one more time.  Mr. Chow might merit his own comedy without the other three.  John Goodman steals all of his scenes as the ruthless villain.  You could tell the cast is still having fun.  That might or might not be true if there was a part 4.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a great game and even though it is free its clear that it is made to absorb your money and its not a good thing if you can't help but pay
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book keeps you on the edge of your seat. Whenever things seem to calm down, at the most unexpected moment a jaw-dropping twist will occur, and you have to reread and ask yourself \\"After all that, could that really just have happened?\\" The narrator also flat-out tells you about specific events that occur at the end of the book, spoiling the end before you get there. Somehow, it only made me want to read more to find out the truth.  I was at once both depressed and overjoyed by this book, and I hope there are more like it.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I had heard this was a good move so i decided to check it out for myself.  I love this movie! Oh my is Alex Pettyfer hot! he looks great as a blonde! the storyline is good too

B00CATSONE|3.0|Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That<br />Invented the 20th Century<br />by: Sean Patrick<br /><br /> Nikola Tesla was an extraordinary inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist, and futurist. The book explains Tesla’s imagination and passion for what he did. He is known as “The Father of Radio,” in which he spent most of his time trying to advance electricity for the world. The book illustrates the struggles, as well as the success Tesla went through in order to accomplish his dream.<br /> When I first picked up this book, I wasn’t aware as to who Tesla was. I began reading expecting a biography about him, but come to find the first chapter is directed personally to the reader. It gives an inspiring message about how different geniuses come to be, and how we all have the power for greatness, but it is up to us to strive for it. The message was heartfelt, inspiring, and was truly worth reading.<br /> As for the actual biography portion of the book, it doesn’t go in depth with Tesla’s personal life. It does explain what he went through as an aspiring inventor such as financial issues, his peers not believing in him, putting trust in the wrong people, and others plagiarizing his work. Tesla definitely was an underrated genius that deserves more recognition. The book does a good job at summarizing the main events, but could’ve gone more in depth with his life.<br /> The author organizes the book in a neat and orderly fashion. The book was an easy read, and I had no trouble understanding what was going on. The author includes many quotes from Tesla and his acquaintances. It was interesting to see how highly others thought of him.<br /> I would give this book three stars out of five. Tesla was humble, caring, and a good role model that a lot more people should know about. This book is great if you want to know some background information on Tesla, but lacks some major depth in details. I would recommend this to anyone from teens toyoung adults. It is a fast and simple read that gets your mind thinking about what you can do to change the world.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Amazing product. Easy to use. My only complaint right now is hulu+ does not have a cast button in their online player (like Netflix).
015206396X|4.0|The book was very slow to start, but once Po is introduced, the story dramatically changes and picks up pace, letting the reader become invested in the story.  This is probably one of the only books where I was invested and interested in the fight scenes, mostly because they weren't just fights of physical brutality, but much more cognitive ones where Po and Leck were involved.  I loved reading about the Graced characters, but some of the scenes moved brutally slowly, such as Katsa and Bitterblue's trek through the mountains.  Some of the plot was bizarrely predictable (what was with them figuring out Leck's Grace without meeting him and somehow being right on the money?  I was very much expecting there to be a twist, and it was kind of disappointing that there wasn't one), and on the other hand, some of the plot was so unpredictable, I thought I'd physically jump out of my spot while reading (Leck's final appearance!  Whoa!)  It will be pretty interesting to read the following books set in this universe, and I hope those stories will be able to engage me as much as this one ended up doing.

B00CPWTRAA|3.0|I like Domingo as a tenor and felt he was unsure of some of the baritone rep here.  There is a slight wobble developing that is distressing as he has always controlled any vibrato completely.  Some of the easy baritone notes seemed strained.  I have hundreds of discs of Domingo and I prefer to listen to him in his glory days.  I admire him continuing to sing and try the baritone rep but it has mixed results.  I was, frankly, disappointed in this album and doubt I'll listen to it very often.  Excellent review of it in &#34;Opera News&#34; so it is certainly a matter of opinion.  I know a few knowledgeable fans do agree with my assessment as well.  Buy it and judge for yourself if you are a fan.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I kept avoiding this game because it never really armed like much fun. I was wrong. I really enjoy this game. I do get a little frustrated that I have to wait 30 minutes to get a new life. However, I've found that it keeps me from wasting hours and hours playing it.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|MUCH less blotchy that the full game, but the same level of greed. Buy, or suffer seems to be the norm. I will not give a dime to those who murdered Vampire Wars. I will play, but refuse to pay. Lungs lingo makes me  a &quot;parasite.&quot;

B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|It was pretty much a mash-up of the old Japanese monster films and the Independence Day film updated with tech.
B000FCKIFU|3.0|I enjoyed the first 4/5s of this book. I liked the offbeat, colorful yet believable enough characters, and the intrigue set up with the rivalry between the various security agencies. The setting was very important to this story and the fact that I was in Washington, D.C. while I was reading it and could relate to places mentioned in the story added to my enjoyment, of course, and was one of the reasons I chose the book. However, the last 1/5th of the book degenerated into a gunfight in the dark that was quite unbelievable and tedious to read. This is the first of The Camel Club series that I've read. I haven't decided yet if I'll read another.

0811870413|3.0|This is a decent book overall if you like to collect bread making books. As an avid baker and pizza maker I was looking forward to it. However, I found it to glaze over details quite often, and doesn't really address starters in great depth. I wouldn't recommend it for a novice. The basic recipe for pizza dough paled in comparison to Jeff Verazzano's free online recipe. I didn't get a whole lot out of this book that I didn't already have, other than the kneading technique. It looks nice on my shelf though, and is an interesting read, if nothing else.

B00EHMG358|5.0|I very much liked the Corrie Swanson character when she first appeared in an earlier Novel.  I believe she has appeared once, maybe more, since.  This preview casts her in the starring role.  Having spent much time in Golden, CO, under the tutalige of my geologist grandfather, the venue is familiar.  P&C have set up a intriguing plot which I am confident will offer hours of the kind of excitement only they can provide.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting so long for this game to come for the kindle I was tired of playing it on my friends phone I wanted to have the game on my own electronic device and now I have it thank you Amazon your the best keep up the good work.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I am using a cordless mic for recordings and I had a problem, it was coming in only in left side. So I bought this little cute mixer and it does the job!<br />It doesn't need even a plug, I pluged it in into a battery backup used for iPad ect. And it works beautiful!<br />So I say it's portable and very easy to handle.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I started playing the game on Facebook, could not wait until I could play on my kindle fire. It is so much fun  to play.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Family loves, loves Castle.  The dynamic between Castle & Becket is great and his character is so real, I'm not sure if he's acting or that's his personality!
B00006DEFA|1.0|The added scenes were cut from the general release. They should have stayed on the cutting room floor. A great movie turns mediocre from all the added junk.
0316227706|5.0|Gave this to a dog-lover friend and it was a HUGE hit. Very unique concept, funny photos, great descriptions. A solid and interesting coffee table book. It was perfect.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Works great. Dual fans. Hard to attach fans after cooler is attached to the CPU. Seems to do the job.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|amazing and fun. great to play and easy to win. great game. under world is very fun. I cant describe how good it is.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|There's no reason to get this if you have a modern game console, bluray player, or computer connected to your TV already.  Lack of IR remote control input frustrates usage and control.  Poor Chrome screen mirroring.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Stumbled upon Castle while at a hotel and now the family is hooked.  The characters are great and their relationships crack us up.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I bought this for my grandson for his 18th birthday, he loves it.  He has watched it several times already.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game for youth and old. Enjoy being able to play on my kindle it is so much easier than my phone.
B005ZI2ZUK|5.0|Kids will love the book. It is a great bedtime story for kids to read. I recommend to kids who want a fun book to read before going to sleep.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read everything Mr. King has published and Doctor Sleep ranks among his finest. it me it was a real page turner that kept my interest right to the end. Even first time readers will enjoy the story, but is suggest reading the Shining first.<br /><br />Thank you Mr. King for continuing to provide what you do!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|It's a calculator and it works. I like it.Very simple design and easy to use. Nice having a full screen image to work with as well
B001NLKXK2|5.0|My Dad was recently diagnosed and this book was suggested to me by a friend.  I cried all the way through it; but, they were tears of relief that we had done everything we could.  It gave us a vision for what we need to do as we walk through this journey.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  I got one for me and my 18 year old grandson, he loves the movie.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|First, I want to make it clear that I am not a comic book fan - this review is coming from the perspective of a person who has never read a Superman comic and likely never will. So, my review is based on a very basic knowledge of the mythology of Superman. I loved all the Christopher Reeves films and I didn't completely hate Superman Returns.<br />I thought the movie, overall, was good, but it could have been better. Here's why:<br />The first thing I hated was that the actress playing Kal-El's mother was emotionless and cardboard. I don't know if she'd just had a botox treatment or what, but she conveyed all the emotion of a brick wall.  But I can forgive that because she's gone from the movie fairly early on in the destruction of Krypton.<br />The next thing that struck me was how everything was just crammed into this movie until it resembled an overstuffed bag of potatoes. People have said that the plot line advanced too slowly. I think the plot moved way too fast and, consequently, only touched some major plot points that should have been developed further. Minor spoiler here - nothing major, but still, if you haven't seen it, you may not want to read this. I really didn't like the way Lois Lane tracked down Superman's true identity so quickly and easily.  There was no tension between them like in the earlier movies. I loved Amy Adams and she did a great job with what she was given, but I would have loved to see a relationship develop more slowly between them and with a lot more friction. Yes, I'm being girly.  Sue me. I would have liked to see more of Superman developing and discovering his powers and him spending more time getting to know Jor-El and learning from him. I would have loved to see more of Superman swooping in and saving the day as part of his normal routine.  Instead, it seems that a lot of time is spent with Superman swooping in and destroying the surroundings. Yeah, I said it.  I know other reviewers have defended the destruction, but I just don't see Superman leveling an entire city just to beat Zod's ...er...rear.  Some have claimed the destruction took place in a part of the city that was clearly evacuated, however, there were plenty of scenes in which that was questionable. It left me wondering how many people died as a result of that fight. And, even if they didn't die, they were left homeless and/or without jobs after their apartments and workplaces were utterly destroyed. I thought the destruction was way over the top and the Superman I grew up with would definitely have tried very hard to take the fight somewhere else. Yes, he was getting beaten pretty badly, but he still would have tried to avoid the destruction.<br />I thought Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe were wonderful. That's saying a lot because I absolutely detest Kevin Costner in most movies I've seen him in. However, I loved Costner as Clark's dad and how he tried to instill wisdom in his son. I really thought that his advice after the school bus incident was going to be to save them but find a way to make it look like you weren't involved. Not &#34;maybe&#34; you should have let them die. I was disappointed with that.<br />I also loved Henry Cavill's take on Superman. His absolute joy when he first tries to fly is priceless. Cavill's Superman isn't condescending the way Reeves' could sometimes be. Reeves seemed to always wear an expression of patronizing amusement, especially when dealing with Lois Lane. Cavill comes across as humble and just a bit naive, but you can see some anger boiling just under the surface. You can see he really wants to &#34;unleash the fury&#34; (As Yngwie Malmsteen would say) sometimes, but manages to keep it under control.<br />Zod was alright - his female sidekick was downright laughable. How did they adjust to their &#34;super powers&#34; so quickly and easily while Superman took years? Some reviewers have complained about the &#34;set in realism&#34; concept. I liked that, actually, but there were plot holes a mile wide and, yes, at times the movie did seem to take itself way too seriously. I thought it could have been better if it were maybe two movies. But, what do I know?  That's why  Nolan is making the big bucks and I'm not.<br />So, all in all, it was a good film. I'll watch it again. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to just watch a good movie. But if you're a comic fan, this probably won't be for you...as evidenced by the many many negative comments from that sector.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|Beyond Oria Falls (Dwellers of Ahwahnee) by Sheryl Seal is a very fascinating story. It really has a unique writing style. I highly recommend to one who enjoys reading and want to be hooked from the very beginning.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|Works great to play my movies for my daughter. Gives me options and separate files only wish the hole thig was free.
B0042FZOFU|3.0|The 4-disc set is from the U.K. but is region-free.<br /><br />The included code does not work for the Disney movie rewards program.<br />Not a deal-breaker but I really wish I could have known in advance.
B00CH3DBNQ|1.0|Felt something was missing in her intentions. I admired her, but felt she was programmed by her father. She is so young to have these adult intuitions.
0307352153|4.0|Very helpful insights for the introvert and has helped me gain understanding into myself and be more accepting of that part of my makeup as a person.  It has also helped me understand why others don't understand us.  In a way a burden has been lifted.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|The movie is great. It helps kids and grown ups to sort up problems that have with their family and make the right choices in life. I bought the dvd for the birthday of my nice. Dvd arrived early before her birthday on perfect condition. The price $5 is very good. They have already seen the movie her parents, relatives, some of her neighbours and of course my nice and her friends. The disc didn't have any scratch or problem. I suggest it to everyone.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Original version on DVD. Han Shoots First. (really, Greedo never gets a shot off). Yes, the picture quality is lower and the letterboxing is intrusive, but totally worth it for the original experience. Having the &#34;enhanced&#34; edition in the box is ok, makes it easier to explain what they &#34;changed&#34;.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|This book allows you to examine yourself and your initial strategies for negotiations. It provides useful tips for compromising and making wise decisions without changing your interest or intent.
B00B5C0YOO|4.0|Got it as FAOD and didn't realize I would be using it as much as I do. Nice interface, easy to use.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|A good effort, but the main problem isn't really solved, no new dynamics between characters, and the end, well, not my favorite.  Just disapointed.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I'm absolutely obsessed with these books!! One of the best stories ever written! I can't put it down! Love it!!
B008UX2UIO|5.0|glorious book :) One of my favorites. I bought it for a friend and we bonded over the antics of all the characters.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a fun game<br /> And keeps my kiddo entertained<br />Very easy to play<br />And has a great guide as well
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show took me by surprise - it's MUCH better than I would personally have thought a show about zombies would be.<br />It's much more really - a study of human nature .... dead or alive !
B000VOC90Y|5.0|We ordered this backpack to carry all of our electronic equipment. There was a small pocket on the top where we could fit all of the cords, a place for my laptop, both my grandson's and my Android tablets, GPS, camcorder etc. with space left over. Was easily accessible to remove the GPS at the car rental place. Easy to carry the heavy load instead of a handheld back that would have hurts the shoulders.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Fun to use both dark and light sides of the force :) Just wish they would update the next level faster!!
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|Loved the book hope they make another movie with the same cast. Glad it was a happy ending for the most part
076781326X|5.0|Excellent, of course, and I am able to watch it several times a year, year after year, and to use it in teaching ESL--language (vocabulary and accents) and culture/history.  I am totally satisfied.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|My favourite phrase from this book:<br />&#34;Start a company, not a startup&#34; how true basic business physics has not changed, live within your means, solve a real problem and expand when it makes sense to do so.<br /><br />In short this book has given me the confidence that I don't need to chase the startup kids, the steady build up that takes a few years is the way to go!
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|We (my 6th and 3 rd graders and myself) expected a book like most others that continues chapter to chapter. This was a bit confusing at first as each &#34;chapter&#34; is a short story.  We came to enjoy our daily readings very much and are looking forward to watching the movie, which we know from experience will not even begin to compare to the book.  We've found the books are always so much better!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|The story of The Book Thief captivated my attention and broke my heart.. I can't say I truly enjoyed it, but I also could stop reading it, &#34;like a moth to a flame.&#34; What a horrific time in our human history...
B00FAOGKR8|5.0|Fits my iPhone 5s like a glove. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I plan on buying more colors asap.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|Fun to watch these movies over again. I had not seen it in a while. Watching this with the advent of the new Stark Trek's is interesting.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I enjoyed this fourth movie in the Hobbit series. It gives a nice background to people who have never read the series. The books are excellent and the transition to the big screen is well done. Colorful and enjoyable, I would recommend this first if you are going to watch the Hobbit trilogy.
B00GOQ9M4O|4.0|I must admit, this episode was not as action packed as some have come to expect. However, we get to take a dive into the split personality of the Governor. Redemption is beyond his grasp and all we can do is wonder what this man driven insane will attempt next. He is the wild card of the series. To call him a loose canon is an understatement. I enjoyed revisiting the character and can't wait to see how it unfolds.<br /><br />I should also note that you should take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. Some people want action 24/7 but this series was never about being action oriented all the time. The quieter times in the series help to create a dynamic experience like the calm before the storm. That way, when the action does occur, it is all the more enjoyable.
0307887448|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  The story is fun and interesting, it never really slows down very much, it flows very well and is a nice and easy read.  I enjoyed the characters and the dynamic between each individual character and their avatar was pretty cool and unique (think Matrix).  The only things I could find to complain about are the fact that I'm too young for a lot of the allusions in the book (of which there are a ton!) which kind of stinks because the ones I did get were very enjoyable.  Basically if you didn't grow up in the 80's you won't get a ton of the references made in the book, not that it detracts from the book all that much, I still loved it, but I think it would have been a lot better had I been familiar with more of the references.  The other thing that I didn't really like was the severity given to the situation by the characters in a video game.  If you don't already know, the book takes place pretty much exclusively in a virtual reality (again, think Matrix).  However, if you die in the game, all that happens is you have to start over with a new character, but in the book they act like the death of your avatar is much akin to death in real life.  This detracts from the grave matters at hand because there isn't a real penalty for failing, sure you might lose your avatar but so what? Just make another one.<br />Let me assure you that these are very small complaints though, I loved the book.  It is just a fun adventure with cool characters and a unique setting.  It's different, and that's a good thing.  I will say that the book will almost definitely not be for everyone.  If you aren't an avid (or at least novice) gamer, you will probably be bored out of your mind by the book as that is pretty much all it is about.  That being said, if you are a gamer, regardless of age, you will still get a kick out of the story even if you don't quite get all the references.  I did at least.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|It truly a work of art. I enjoy working out to this cd. It makes you want to move. I enjoy her music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy set up.  I watched a movie and it was very clear.  I have not been able to link the Crhomecast with my IPad or phone as of yet.  I do not understand why it is not working.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book deserves zero starts. It was dreadful and I want the time back that I wasted reading it. What a disappointment since I loved the first two books.
B007QA3AH2|2.0|Well, the word cheesy comes to mind. I expected more from the main characters. The plot is neither exciting or dull, but somewhere in between. All of the actors have turned in better performances and that they are in this movie is the only reason I watched it. This movie is a ho-hum combo of Star Trek and Star Wars with tidbits of other sci-fi movies of the past.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I absolutely love this game the grwphcs are clear and it doesn't make my kindle freeze or lagg. A &#34;must play&#34; game !
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's a pretty cool game. It is really addicting and  good for down time and to ease boredom. Love it
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I think they are very talent bunch. I love the music and the vocals. Its truly a band that I enjoy a lot.
B001R4MEUM|4.0|This is when Genesis was really cutting edge. It reminds me of &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; more than their later, pop efforts. Wish someone had invested more in production values. Great gift for someone who collects little know genius efforts.
0062278096|5.0|Love this book! I got it as a gift for my girlfriend, who is a fan of the show. I love the show as well, and will probably buy a copy of this book for myself! I love that it's mostly in a hand-written style and that Sherlock leaves little comments of John's writing. Great book for the avid Sherlock lover!
B00EI4V3X2|5.0|Sound quality is great for a $150 gaming headset. Easier to setup than some people seem to think. Works great and I do feel like I am hearing other people better than they hear me. Would definitely recommend for PS3 or PS4!
B00125WAWS|4.0|Great movie! Used for an English class when we discussed argument and debate. I will definitely use it in the future!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really loved this book. I happen to be a very empathic person, so I love it when a character is written so well that when they feel something in the story, I can feel it myself. In this book, I could feel Ender's sorrow, his regret, and his anger with an almost pristine clarity. I am exceedingly glad I read this book, and I look forward to reading other books by Orson Scott Card.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Fantastic device that works seamlessly with my tablet and phone, giving me the ability to distribute sound for any device that supports Bluetooth.
0515153656|1.0|Plot holes. If I were Lee Child I'd get a better editor. IMO, I think his editor needs to spend more time in America and the gun range. In this book, an American calls his cell phone his &#34;mobile.&#34; Might as well call his flashlight a &#34;torch.&#34; Reacher cleans up bodies at one crime scene but neglects to pick up the shells from his shotgun. And the ultra powerful shotgun he uses would leave blood all over the place. He shoots a Desert Eagle and no one seems to notice and his ears aren't ringing. Reacher sets fire to the only modern police station and warehouse in America without a sprinkler system. Reacher barely bathes, brushes his teeth or changes clothes. Seriously, the guy must reek. Ever smell yourself  after you spent a couple of days on an all night bus?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|.  I have read many books written about WWll and this story by far is my favorite!  Take the time to read this book.  It's an ugly story beautifully written.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|It was epic it was the best game I have ever played I love this game it is my favorite game of all time
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|It was a ok movie was entertaining but that's about it.The ending when he puts on a pair of glasses and gets a job at he newspaper is really kills the immersion. They should have cut the ending. LOL those are the stupidest reporters this side of the planet. LOL I mean come on you were just throat deep in the mans mouth but do not know what he looks like.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|An amazing account of a hero's plight to educate the people in her country.<br />Her bravery is an inspiration.  I saw her appearance on the The Daily News<br />with Jon Stewart.  She is articulate, kind, and genuine.<br />Every one should read this!!!
B004WR125O|5.0|Great device that works really well.  Got it hooked up on to my wireless network within minutes!  Very pleased to have this extensible option although it would have been nicer had the receiver included this capability by default.  Given the price it wasn't painful to include as part of the bundling that I purchased.  Leveraging this for Pandora and other apps built into the receiver was an unexpected pleasure to stumble into and is a wise investment if you intend to extend such capabilities as mentioned.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a great time using hints and clues to solve each part of the puzzle. Almost too short but I'm  excited for the sequel.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|sorry------boring and tedious----clearly writing to get a paycheck--had a very hard time staying focused on this book--too much rambling and unnecessary details detracted from this book.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|Very nice book one of my favorites in the series I just got the new one it is very good also love it
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|I chose to give this two stars, NOT because the movie itself wasn't amazing...indeed it was, but because amazon kept disconnecting and saying that the connection speed was too slow...it would then start the entire movie over again from the beginning, leaving me attempting to find where I last left off. This happened over ten times throughout the movie and in doing so made the movie not so enjoyable. I am sure some will say that maybe this is due to my connection speed from home via wifi....that being said, I checked it from my smart phone which had no issues as well as my ROKU connection speed. So, I am not sure what the heck was going on...but this viewing experience was one of my least favorites, I must say.
1449410243|5.0|I read theoatmeal.com every day. I love the author as he is very creative and super funny. We have 2 cats and I love his takes on cats. Everything is very well drawn out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so much fun I am so happy I found it I can not stop playing it  it is great.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|very intriguing game.  one I would like to continue playing the full version. the little girl is very very creepy
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|I think I would recommend this book over many of the other North Korea gulag stories that have hit the shelves lately. Then again, we should be reading as many of these as possible to get a clear sense of what's happening over there, as horrifying as it is. It matches &#34;Nothing To Envy&#34; by Barbara Demick but has a much faster pace and less descriptive passages so the focus is entirely on Shin's grueling escape.
B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|I make every shot I attempt and its very pricey very very fun. Another thing is that I I have to reopen it 20 times
B0002EXFNI|5.0|The first time we watched this movie it was by accident, but couldn't stop watching. Something about rooting for &#34;true love&#34; & the underdog always works. But it's not just that. Emile Hirsch is just wonderful in this movie. So warm, easy to relate & connect with. & Elisha Cuthbert is also just wonderful. The support cast is equally enjoyable. The storyline never boring or slow either.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|This movie would be 5 stars if they hadn't made the 'deados' so disgusting.  Loved the story line, loved Proctor and I especially loved Jeff's performance. Not sure what everyone had a problem with the way he talked, since his performance as a bitter old west gunslinger was priceless.  He overshadows the gorgeous Ryan Reynolds, and that's not easy to do. I bought it and have watched it twice. Will be watching it again soon. Highly recommended
B008K3HRF0|1.0|Way to hate on the capitalists of the world. I regret getting this movie for my kids. This movie makes business people out to be &#34;evil greedy bad guys&#34; and it indoctrinates kids. Get your kids &#34;Up!&#34; or &#34;Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs&#34; instead.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is well written, sexy as all get out and has a great story line.  Would read anything she writes. Can't wait to get the other two in the series!!  Thanks for a great book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Different and endearing.  Seen through the eyes of death and youth this story touches every sense of the readers being.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Great case! A little hard to access the volume button but it's a slim case. The armor S is a little bit thinner
B005QPMB2Y|1.0|Installed the free version several weeks ago and liked it enough to buy the paid version.  Worked fine until today, when it stopped working properly and displayed the message &quot;Please uninstall and reinstall from the Android Play Store.&quot;  Did that and it still wouldn't work and displayed the same message.  Tried to uninstall and reinstall again and continued to get the same message.  Don't waste your time with this or you may wind up paying for it multiple times with it still not working correctly.
B00GIXWXEO|5.0|I bought this sight unseen, not even knowing the cast.  It surprised me when I recognized Ryan Reynolds as Turbo, the cute little snail who dreams of being in the Indy 500.  While the plot isn't at all believable, it was the cutest and most original movie I've seen in a long time.  Yeah, it does start off feeling like a Ratatouille knock-off, but it quickly takes a different path. This one appeals to all ages, and I loved it.  My family has watched it 3 times since we got it, and I'm sure we'll watch it again soon.  The ensemble cast is great, and there are MANY laughs throughout the story.  You know it's something special when you are rooting for a snail to win a car race.  I just don't understand the few bad reviews for this movie.  You people either have no heart or no sense of humor!  Maybe both?  Try watching it again and do it with an open mind.  It doesn't have to be real to be enjoyed!
145210655X|5.0|This book is Adorable. My husband loves it! It is Cute and funny. we also liked the animation and the story
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Canadian buyers should be aware that if you are purchasing to watch Netflix or amazon Prime from a mobile device or from Chrome you can't use a VPN to get US netlfix on the device and then cast to the chromecast.  It won't work.  Other than that, it basically just streams Netflix at the moment but most of us already have TVs and streaming devices anyway.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Me and my brother were on a server and he logged off and when he logged back on he died. Which is bad because he lost a DIAMOND sword. Other than that it it is really awesome. The monsters, the graphics, the pure aspect it's all fun and games until your brother starts the PvP. I'm still mad at him.<br /><br />The bro and sis team
B0084YM1S8|5.0|The 180 gram give the true clarity of the music without the hiss and pop.  It's nice to have fresh sturdy copies without any WOW.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|my girlfriend started playing this game and has now gotten me hooked. I am an abbed gamer who loves a good puzzle game and this is hard to find.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|It's actually more a 4.5 review, since it's not perfect, but I almost did love the movie.  Mostly because it was a more realistic version of how Superman would really be.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Christopher Reeve's version, but I never really liked how the bad guys were portrayed.  They went more comical than anything, and the real bad guys going after Superman shouldn't be funny.  This Zod was a true bad guy, even though he had his own best intentions, and they are understandable.  It was a bit confusing how they went from the baby being sent off Krypton as it was destroyed and immediately show Clark as a man on his own, but they do show many flashbacks filling us in on how hard his childhood was.  It was jarring at first but I quickly got used to it.  One review I read months ago said that humanity would never trust Superman due to all the deaths caused because of him, but that's not how I saw it at all.  He does his best to keep any of that from happening, but Zod never intended to leave any of them alive, so the loss of a few hundred thousand wasn't as bad as it could have been.  True, Superman could have led Zod to an unpopulated area, and it's not clear why he didn't, but even that can be forgiven.  It was a nicely put together movie, and Cavill did a much better job with the role than I thought he would.  He WAS Superman, and I can't wait to watch it again.
B00FWLTPU8|4.0|I didnt think I would like this movie but I really did. It had a lot of action and adventure, the slight romance missed the mark though, because of that I really am thinking 3.5 stars.<br /><br />The action was so action packed that it made up for the sometimes awkward interactions
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This version is a whole lot better than the face book version! Works just fine on my kindle fire HD
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|This movie was off the hook. Denzel played an amazing role. I actually watched this movie 2 times, and i almost never watch movies more than 2 times.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|I like Pendergast & I like Holmes . But this book I did not care for. I lost interest, by the second half. I did finish however. Could not warm to the story. Hoping next years tale is more to my liking.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, fast paced.  The updates are great. Minions are cute.  The graphics are great. This game is a FUN way to kill time.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|This was a great book just like I expected it to be ,I have read and have all her books I can not wait to see what she will write about next .i even have her cook book
B00FPH51LQ|5.0|i love this movie mainly because my 11 and 13 year old do. It keeps them plenty entertained...&#34;like a coyote never could&#34;.
B00AJFEHAU|4.0|The album has four songs. Yes, they're really good, but the price is just too high. EP's are usually more comfortably priced. Besides that, it's a good album. It's a bit different from a typical jewel case CD so that was interesting.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Really?  3 digit MGB. Would not run, and I deleted as much apps as I was willing to to try it.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|One of my favorite albums ever, displacing childhood favorites like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall.  The albums are a collection of great musical variety with many instruments.  This is a compilation for those who like music.  Natalie's voice just makes it all the better.
B0012IWRF0|5.0|Fantastic album. I will note that the album art was not the art displayed on Amazon, but what I received is pretty epic, so no complaints other than it was a curveball.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a nice game. Good challenges level. The puzzles have thought behind them even if some of them seem a little simple. I recommend this game to people looking for a little puzzle. Hopefully more levels will come out soon.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|if my kid tells me to &#34;take a knee&#34; one more time. LOL. This is a decent story, I think there could have been more depth and more family interaction but overall the teens really loved it.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|It's a bit awkward to play but gets better the longer you play. Give it a shot you will like it
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I never review, and I never pay for games.  this FAOTD is the kind of ap I would buy if I knew in advance it was so good.  I didn't put the game down since I got it.  will blame you all when I get carpotunnel issues!  So, very logical puzzle, not so hard as to drive me away.  I like the challenge of guessing and getting my errors noted.  The challenge then becomes getting a better rate of errors next time.  I completed the game in about 2-3 days, something I like to do, so now I will only bring it back when I am bored and need a brain stimulator.  No ads at all at present, and not even a request for a review, which makes me more likely to review!
B000006OAM|5.0|Love Natalie Merchant - wanted the CD instead of electronic version. I am glad that a new product was available for so reasonable a price
B0011UJMK2|3.0|The most interesting aspect of this potboiler is the insight it offers into Stalinist Russia. What a hell it must have been. The right wing tea party crowd appears to have the same circular mindset.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH I'm officially addicted!!! Never have I been satisfied with a town app until I saw this
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The first movie drew me to the books, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading them.  A peaceful ending to a sometimes violent story.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Kathy Reich's  books never fail, always a superb read and this one is no different. Fast paced an full of danger.
B004PGO25O|4.0|Quick, easy, yet profoundly important read for anyone who's looking to create. I for one will be referencing this book again and often.
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|This app does not work properly on the Kindle Fire.  I have a regular Kindle Fire, not the HD.  I downloaded the Free version of Glow Hockey, and it ran, but every time I closed it I got an error message, and had to do a &#34;Force Close&#34;.  Eventually this caused my whole Kindle to shut down and I had to do a factory reset to be able to use the Kindle at all.  I know it was this app because when we tried it on a fresh install it did the same thing.  Now that it is completely removed from the Cloud and I did a Deregister/Register operation, the Kindle will work.  NOT worth the hassle for this simple game.
B00BESNKB8|2.0|We turned this movie off within the first hour.  We tried to stick with it but it was just not our cup of tea.
0060555661|4.0|Taking business in college now, and I am looking to start investing in something solid... While I have a few ideas I feel like I also need a few pointers. This book looks solid enough.
B007MHVVCU|5.0|Very creative, amazing, perfect, outstanding, well-thought-out plot, wonderful characters... Those words aren't enough to describe how awesome this book is and best of all NO ROMANCE! Definitely clean and I love that!<br />This is a must read for people who like magic, witches and ghost related stories with kids that have epic powers. This book is also for thrill seekers and people who enjoy a lot of action!<br />I totally recommend it...
B006IYG5HE|4.0|I want to be Harry! He has many faults and short comings but he is a man of action and morally sound.  Read this book and meet Harry.  You may not LOVE him but you will respect him.
0307346617|2.0|Book was in terrible condition with underlines and marks all over text.  Go get a bran new one at Walmart.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I am aware of \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\", but I've neither read it nor seen the film. I've been a voracious reader since childhood, but motherhood and teaching my child at home have left me with precious little time for reading the novels that used to be my chief amusement. I'm more likely to read non-fiction, now, as I try to squeeze every possible drop of brain activity from my time with books, and often I read on topics at least loosely related to what we're doing in our home school curriculum. So how did I come to read this recent, popular novel? Upon arriving yesterday for a visit to my parents' house, my mother offered it to me. She'd heard the author speak, and the book was handed out to the audience. Would I like to read it first, since she is so busy preparing for the holidays?<br /><br />I accepted the book out of politeness. I don't always care for my mother's favorite books (and I don't really think she will love this one when she gets around to it!) A few pages in, however, and I hardly put the book down until I was done this afternoon. I really enjoyed this story.<br /><br />This novel didn't read particularly quickly, but I enjoyed every steadily-paced word as it came. Sometimes, with a historical novel, I feel more absorbed by weightier prose, which seems to better suit the pace of earlier centuries. Add the theme of natural philosophy/science, and, again, it feels correct to chew on the words instead of letting them slip right down.<br /><br />I am a woman who studied technology when the field was 95% men, so I was drawn to Alma's \\"unladylike\\" pursuits. I love science and math. But beyond this modest connection to the story here, I most deeply appreciated the novel because I was genuinely surprised by the plot, and almost nothing felt stereotypical or overly familiar. This matters so much more to me at mid-life than it did in my youth with all the time in the world left to spend however frivolously. This story felt new.<br /><br />Some readers of historical fiction may dislike the frank (and unconventional) sexual themes that develop partway through the book. I didn't mind it, as it was neither gratuitous nor violent, but it is worth pointing out to very conservative readers. When these themes first came up, I wondered if I'd accidentally fallen in love with a bodice-ripper in deep disguise (last happened to me with Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\"), but seeing the book through, I think appropriate weight was given to the topic based upon the protagonist's eventual trajectory.<br /><br />There are plenty of reviews that offer a synopsis. Instead, I offer a sketch of myself as the sort of person who might really appreciate this novel. It made me think, it made me feel, but it also left me with a sense of joy. So many \\"serious\\" novels seem to prove themselves weighty with beautiful words about miserable things. How wonderful to be enlightened--literally!--with a thought-provoking novel that allows for hope.fiction may dislike the frank (and unconventional) sexual themes that develop partway through the book.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is  awesome and fun to play and all ages can play my cousin got me hooked on this game
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Not impressed! I expected more. The writing was meh. The first two books were excellent. The end of Insurgent set up for an epic ending of this series, sadly Veronica Roth did not deliver. Read the first two, stop there and use your imagination end the story. Wish I had =(
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Love the books, love the show, and can't wait until the next book comes out!!!! Does anyone know when that is???
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|A truly wonderful Pendergast intertwined with Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle.  As always, Preston and Child have accomplished a masterful reading experience.  For lovers of mystery and suspense written in a highly literate format, this is a wonderful addition to the Pendergast series.
B00028HBKM|5.0|MEET GOD IN THE FLESH....IT REALLY WAKES YOU UP. SOME PAID FOR OUR SINS  THANK YOU FATHER GOD FOR YOUR LOVE IN THE FLESH.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was really hesitant about reading this book because I don't really like reading stories that I know will make me cry. (I'm a huge animal lover and I hate reading about hurting animals in any way).<br /><br />But the story was really great. It was hilarious, and being in the voice of a dog made it even funnier. I feel like that's what dogs are probably thinking about humans when we do stupid things. Haha.<br /><br />It was heart warming, as I expected it to be. It's a great book club book!
B005LAII4E|5.0|Cant go wrong with the Rock big mean somehow he always gets it done lots of explosions nice movie to add to collection.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Such a sad story, I can't help but to think how confusing life must of been for her and how even though she is recovering , she will suffer from the media and Todd for ever. My heart goes out to her and her mother.  I did think there would be more about her children than stray cats, but I was not in her shoes. Good luck Jaycee
B0064MPXFA|5.0|While the story is fictional, it reflects some truth to what's happened to modern-day politicians. I can't help rooting for the &#34;good wife&#34; to succeed in her professional pursuits against the odds. Very engaging with its plot twists and turns. The writers have done a terrific job to make the court cases so suspenseful and unpredictable.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This is so easy to use. The sounds and the snooze....allow me to wake up or snooze up...Lots of options to change it up!
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Am I the only one who didn't like his book? I'm upset because I've been looking forward to it, and now I'm just disappointed.<br /><br />I don't understand what the story was. I didn't see a plot or even a purpose to this story. It was a fantasy story with no flow and no real story line. I was waiting for it a to come together and it just.. didn't.<br /><br />I wasn't sure if the characters were magical or what the purpose of the &#34;ocean&#34; was or what it was supposed to depict. It was a strange book and I'm a lite frustrated because I didn't get the message... I also didn't like the inner monologue of the boy. No seven year old boy has such imaginative thoughts, but maybe that was the whole point? I really don't know.
B00471JSR4|5.0|Definitely one of my favorate action movies lots of fighting lots of action really held my attention.during the whole movie.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Easy to figure out. Works well on the Kindle.  Fun way to spend time when under the weather.  Okay to sit for a while and then come back.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I'm sure i would love this camera if it was on my kindle, did I buy it ?? or do i need to yet download it??? who knows but its not on my kindle, but no worries Amazon always take care of business i will call them.
B001GMQALY|2.0|There are great looking ppl than Kim and her partner. Some ppl called it steamy!! May be those are the ones who do not have a good married life with 'steam'!! Low lighting, no complete nudity, no passion....without these, I do not know how it could be 'steamy'. Love cannot emerge from 'sex'. FYI...I saw this with my wife and found it to be irrelevant.<br />But on the other hand for the folks who are single and are imagining 'scenes', yeah, may be this can be useful. But, I still think this is just another movie eyeing at the $$ from customers rather than what is expected.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|Love this game. Crops never wilt. Very cute. My 6 year old loves helping me. To update you need to uninstall and then reinstall the app. Everything saves and then you have new version and it is so neat. Happy farming.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I really like this because I can never talk to my friends with out calling them on my home phone cause I dont have phone cause my mom said I am no old anofe
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|This is one of the most addictive games i have played in a long time. You get addicted by the human need to be better than you were 5 minutes ago...but be careful. If you are to anxious to play more and your crops are growing, you WILL be tricked into paying for instant growth fertilizer! There are free wheel spins everyday for great prizes...and i promise this game will never get old.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I never buy albums as I typically just use a streaming service to hear the songs I want, but as a big Muse fan I bought this album and I have to say I was not impressed.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|A little bit of a long read but worth it I finished it in 4 day's. WWII you know it's going to have it's moments. so read at your own risk.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|This is a great way to show toddlers how to listen and fallow instructions. This is a great game for most kids
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book. It's the first book I have read in a long time, that could actually keep my attention. It left me wanting to read it, but I hated the ending!!!! It left me feeling sad and angry! I wanted him to be able to change. But I guess the point of the book was that you cannot change people no matter how hard you try. Life lesson that I have painfully lived myself! O I just realized it not the end! Fifty Shades Darker continues the first book! It's a Trilogy! Yay I'm so excited! Maybe he does change? I guess I will see... You probably think I am stupid, but this is the first book I've read in forever and dd not realize it was Trilogy! But what a great surprise!!! :)
B00BUWY74M|4.0|No better all-around guide to Triathlon. I have read and re-read this manual over the years. Joe Friel probably know more about training and triathlon than anyone. For a beginner, there is a lot to learn, and this manual teaches it all. If you are experienced with triathlon, it is a great reference guide. Get sport specific guides for more depth in any-one sport. It can't go into the same level of detail as a cycling specific guide for example.<br /><br />Pros - Information dense. Covers all the sports. Year round advice. Delves into the science of training. A lot of great workouts included to keep revisiting. Follow this program and you will perform well.<br /><br />Cons - Although just released, the Kindle version is not a modern kindle book with proper layout and difficult to navigate. Stick with the paper copy rather than buying the kindle version until it is improved.
B00DFZX97I|5.0|I'm not much of a reader. I will pick up a book here and there and read a few pages a night. My mother-in-law borrowed it to me 4 days ago. I told her that may not be such a good idea because I consider myself a slow reader, 300 pages takes me 2 weeks or so. I could not put this book down! It was an easy read and the character development was fantastic. I have never read a Stephen King book before, but I am a fan now and can't wait to read something else of his!
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I love this game. It becomes addicting very quickly. The only negatives I have so far are that the game kind of lags from time to time and it will not let me connect my account to Facebook. Other than that, if you love a challenge that gets harder each time, this is the game for you!
B00CUWWLWG|1.0|we couldn't play it at all. wouldn't even load. I'm sure it would have been a great game other wise.
0375869026|5.0|11-year old daughter was reading in school and loved it.  So we bought it for home.  Both my wife and I loved it as well.  I like the writing style and how the story is told from different perspectives.  We were at Dutch Wonderland theme park one day, and on the choo-choo train was a young boy who physically reminded us of the main character.  He had a huge smile on his face, and couldn't seem happier ... it brought a tear to our eyes, as we remembered the book and realized that this is reality for many kids and their families.  We pray for them each day.
B004YRSBTW|5.0|The first time I watched this movie, I had to watch it again right away. One of those movies that is one of a kind, great story line, lots of good quotes and a lot of fun.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|Best comedy on tv, hands down! Gonna be sad to see it go after this season! Luckily they are just as funny the second and third time around!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This little gives my giggles and laugh-out-louds very time I pick it up and read a poem. Even for the umpteenth time. 'Nuff said.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I like this game a lot. I really enjoy playing this game and so does my family. I just don't like having to spend real money to play it. over all its a great game.
B00DXP7L88|5.0|DEXTER was an awesome series and with this purchase I have all its seasons.  No spoilers but I will say this final season was an awesome roller-coaster ride of ride of emotionally wrenching ups and downs.  You got to see sides of people that you never thought possible.  The ending was in some ways satisfying and in other ways disappointing in ways that seem to leave open the possibility of a reunion show or movie.<br /><br />The final season shows Dexter undergoing a sort of cathartic healing which is just a tad unrealistic for most but not all serial killers.  Serial killers don't usually go into spontaneous remission but the writers had to end the series somehow and they did a good job here.  I do think its possible to constantly manage deep ugly antisocial inner urges with enough mental discipline, I'm living proof of that.<br /><br />While the way Dexter ended might not please everyone, I think the final season ended all the story arcs on a satisfying note.  I think the ending was unique enough to elevate it above the canned expected endings.  The writers take you on a romp through several endings till you get to the one true final surprise ending.  Dexter was a great series that went out with a bang not a whimper and for that I give it five stars!
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|Still a great movie after all these years. Added bonus - I found it suitable to watch with my 12 year old son.
B004132HZS|5.0|My entire family loves Sherlock! There is nothing in these movies that a younger child couldn't see (imo)  but the story line is definitely adult and will keep you glued to the set ......even after the ending.....There are season end cliff hangers that have you breathlessly waiting for the next installment.
B00DYEN5QU|5.0|I really, really wanted to see this at the theaters, but missed it (due to some...  logistical concerns?) so I only got to see the film, for the very first time, this last weekend.  I was hopeful, but cautious...  who would know if it would be any good?<br /><br />I avoided the reviews, until after I'd seen it, and then read the \\"rotten tomatoes\\" reviews on the film.  I find myself wondering what film some of these people were watching, and whether or not the reviewers have any idea what they're talking about.  It seems that most of them refer to the 1979 movie as \\"the source material\\" and have no idea that the character of Superman has been around a LOT longer than that, and that the character has been played by many, many different actors, not just the late Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />I knew, the moment I first saw the actor in-character, though, that they'd finally gotten the casting RIGHT.  I've liked various actors at various times to various degrees, but I'd never seen any of them who looked like the character in the books, until now.  Henry Cavill is, in my personal opinion, the single best casting choice for this character yet, and I find it hard to believe that there will be a better one to follow.<br /><br />So...  the film starts, and we get Krypton.  Not the Krypton from the 1979 movie, but an amalgam of different Kryptons from the history of the character.  We see the \\"organic, grown technology aspect,\\" we get the floating drones (taken almost without alteration from the 1980s comic book reboot, by the same title as this film, \\"The Man of Steel\\"), but we also get the \\"pulp sci-fi\\" elements of the older versions of Krypton as well...  including the once-ever-present \\"flying beasts\\" and so forth.<br /><br />Many, many reviewers recoiled with horror from this sequence... not because it's not faithful to the source material, and not because it's not \\"good storytelling,\\" but simply because it's \\"not big white crystal spires with Marlon Brando in white\\" just redressed.  So, let's be clear... THE KRYPTON IN THE MOVIE IS CLOSER TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL VERSION THAN THE VERSION SEEN IN THE 1979 FILM!  Got it, folks?<br /><br />The film, wisely, skips over the \\"chronological origin story\\" since we all, pretty much, know that the Kents found Kal-L, named him \\"Clark,\\" and raised him as their son.  We're not pounded over the head with a repeat of the full \\"Clark growing up backstory\\" but we are shown enough to tell the (rare) newcomer pretty much what's going on, without just rehashing old territory.<br /><br />We are shown General Zod...  but, unlike the (forgive the term) \\"Cartoon villain\\" Zod we've seen previously, we get a character who actually is not (at least in his own eyes) the \\"bad guy.\\"  There is no doubt, in this film... Zod sees himself as the hero.. the savior of his race.<br /><br />What a refreshing thing to see in a film...  a \\"bad guy\\" who actually has a real motivation, real emotions which we, as the audience, can relate to.  Isn't it almost shocking to see a \\"villain\\" who becomes the villain because, in some twisted way, he's trying to \\"do good?\\"  I LOVED this.  It was so, so much more satisfying than another \\"mustachio-twirling guy\\" (through granted, I still love the cartoonish villains from the 1979 film in their own way)<br /><br />We didn't get a full backstory for Clark... instead, we \\"discover\\" key moments in his past through flashbacks.  It works very well, because it's in no way \\"contrived.\\"  We see scenes we KNOW are important, not because the producers are showing them to us, but because the CHARACTER is showing them to us...  it makes a difference in terms of the impact of each scene.<br /><br />There are stumbles, of course.  I found the \\"death of Jonathan Kent\\" to be really, really badly handled.  I get what they were trying to do...  show us that Jonathan Kent was more concerned with hiding Clark's nature than with anything else.  But...  I'm sorry, it was just SILLY.  Why not have Jonathan carry the child, and have Clark run back to get the dog?  (I mean, Clark would be faster...  and a LOT stronger...  and would have a far better chance of success.  And even if he had to use \\"super power\\" in some way, with the tornado behind him most people would not really notice, or would attribute it to their imagination!)<br /><br />I also didn't like how obvious it is, now, where Superman hails from.  Surely SOMEONE would stop to ask \\"why did the Kryptonians attack Smallville, Kansas?\\"  Especially now that it's known that Superman \\"grew up in Kansas.\\"  Martha, expect to see some visitors in black helicopters coming your way soon!<br /><br />I liked the \\"wandering to find my way\\" bit...  which, by the way, IS canonical, depending on which version of Superman you're talking about (Clark didn't necessarily go straight from Smallville High to the Daily Planet).  I realize some people will find this derivative of the scenes at the beginning of \\"Batman Begins\\" but the \\"derivation\\" of this far, far predates that...  read some Joseph Campbell, for his discussion of the \\"hero's journey\\" which always involves some period of self-exploration and even self-denial.<br /><br />I will admit that I was surprised to see Lois learning about Clark's identity before he worked at the Planet, but I'm OK with that.  And I liked the portrayal of Lois Lane, though I must admit, the actress playing her was... to my mind...  fairly \\"generic,\\" and easily replaceable.  (I actually think that the best Lois to date is Erica Durance, from the series \\"Smallville.\\")<br /><br />The final conflict-stage of the film showed a LOT of violence and devastation...  and the action was non-stop.  This could have been toned down, a bit, I think...  the CGI effects went over the top...  but this was more consistent with what we see in the comic books than you might think.  (I just hope that Superman takes an active hand in the reconstruction, or it'll take many decades... after all, we've still yet to see a completed replacement for the World Trade Center!)<br /><br />The biggest compliant from \\"serious\\" Superman fans is the end of the final battle sequence...  where Superman kills.  But I find that to be a truly sad complaint, showing a lack of grasp of reality (an odd statement to make in relation to a \\"comic book movie\\" I suppose).  IN REAL LIFE, there are situations when there's simply no option.  You can try to \\"make peace\\" but sometimes, if the other guy is unwilling to make peace with YOU, you have no choice but to knock him down, and make sure he can't get back up again.  In this case, Zod was trying to continue to murder people...  personally, no less (the tens of thousands of dead from his \\"technological attacks\\" previously would, to his mind, be collateral damage, not \\"murder\\" per-se) and there was NO WAY that you could restrain him, imprison him, or otherwise make him stop... other than simply stopping him, permanently.<br /><br />By killing Zod, Superman saved hundreds of millions, if not six billion, human lives.  A heavy price to pay, but one that a TRUE HERO would have to pay (side note - this is an ongoing discussion in \\"Batman\\" circles...  is Batman actually responsible for all the deaths caused by The Joker, since had Batman simply killed the Joker early on, none of those people would have died?)<br /><br />The end of the film... apparently after a major reconstruction effort in Metropolis (and maybe it was the ongoing help in reconstruction which results in Superman becoming, nominally, headquartered in Metropolis rather than, say, New York or Los Angeles or Chicago)...  we find ourselves with the \\"status quo\\" we all expect to see...  Clark Kent as reporter at the Daily Planet, working with Lois Lane.  Any future films in this \\"cycle\\" will feel much more... familiar?...  to the casual fan.<br /><br />There is NO LEX LUTHOR in this film...  but there are signs aplenty of the presence of \\"LexCorp,\\" as well as several small references to \\"Wayne Enterprises\\" and \\"Ferris Aircraft,\\" among others... showing that this film takes place in a larger DC Comics universe.<br /><br />And it's being talked about now that the sequel to this film will likely involve some other characters...  Batman and Wonder Woman, very likely (who MAY have even been seen in this film, in a much-debated point), along with Green Lantern.  Maybe we'll even see Green Arrow or some of the other characters come along, in \\"realistic\\" forms.<br /><br />You see, DC has taken note of the success of \\"The Avengers\\" and the \\"whole Marvel Universe\\" approach...  and they're unlikely to let this go.<br /><br />What you see in this film is the origin story of Superman...  in a way you've never seen before.<br /><br />It's not a \\"darker\\" story...  but it's not CAMP.  It's perhaps the first fully SERIOUS take on the Superman concept (Smallville, the series, was pretty serious at times, but was a bit too \\"soap opera-ish\\" to really count, in my opinion... and all the other versions were light-hearted, non-serious approaches).<br /><br />This is a Superman who exists in a world which we can recognize, with rules we can recognize...  and people who act like real people, not like \\"cartoon characters.\\"<br /><br />I, for one, have been waiting to see this for a very long time.  And this film, a few minor flaws aside, delivers what I was looking for!<br /><br />EDIT:  As a side note, I strongly recommend the following (I have it as an audiobook) to give you a better vision of Krypton.  The Krypton as seen in this film is really very consistent with this book...<br /><br />***************<br /><br />[[ASIN:006134074X Last Days Krypton Kevin Anderson]]<br /><br />*****************

B00915G6SU|5.0|good one, kept our interest just like the seasons usually do but I especially liked the intenseness in this season
B00BRUPICM|5.0|I really liked this book. It was easy to read and very interesting. I like police procedurals. This one had a special twist to it that I really liked.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I never thought I would get hooked to these books. But with all of the suspense, I couldn't put them down. But America, please pick a guy already, the drama is getting annoying now.
B000SEGQNS|5.0|Super readable, very focused. Gives great examples. I re-read it periodically to help me keep my own workshops focused too.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I love this show!  It is fresh and creative.  I have all 6 seasons I my family is never disappointed with any episode.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|I loved every minute of this game!  The storyline was intriguing, and the puzzles were not so difficult that I couldn't figure it out, but hard enough that it took brain power.  I was so disappointed when it was over, but I can't wait for the next installment.  I just couldn't put it down!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was a great game because of the graphics and I love horses  any one who likes horses play this game
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book several times since its original release.  For me its impossible to put down. Trying not to spoil the book for others I'll say just one thing, the battle room is to die for.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|very intriguing storyline. well written. difficult to put down! I would recommend this book to anyone who is stuck inside on a rainy weekend
B000U0O9FM|4.0|Excellent novel. Well written and intriguing. Certainly a psychological thriller that leads the reader to reanalyze their perspective on life and what it means to truly be alive.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|I liked it. Didn't catch it first run, and I am someone who always wonders, &#34;but what happens next?&#34;. In that respect, got into it. Halfway through the second season currently.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|its the truth great shows great service survey confusing so i will sat love it love it love it can i go now
B004J4WLB4|5.0|enjoyed it very much the same as everyone in my book club. Well writen and hard to put down. Nice story written beautifully.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Must stop and wait if you don't want to pay.  This is obviously designed to suck money.  Other than that, its super fun!
B008PZZV8S|3.0|this is a good way to kill a couple of hours.<br />Good drama but no real suprizes.  Shouldn't be your first choice.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|BTD 5 is boss. It is sure to make loads of fun. People of all age will love it. I have played it for hours on the computer and now having it mobile is great. It is one of my favorite games.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Is it really cool but come on the happy b-day song is not available unless you buy theFUll GAME<br /><br />Unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1612191290|1.0|I was looking for an actual history of debt. What I got was a sprawling rant with conveniently placed facts and figures that tried to cover way too many topics: sex trade, slavery, religion, linguistics, and, tangentially, economics. I suppose covering many topics with tenuous connections to your purported thesis is a great way to convince some people that your work has wide-reaching implications. I was shocked to discover that the author is currently a professor at LSE and had been with UCL and Yale because I would put this in the category of one of the most poorly constructed academic arguments I have yet read.<br /><br />I desperately wanted to stop reading about 1/3 of the way in - it is repetitive, poorly written and provides neither new nor interesting information, but it was so well-reviewed, that I thought I'd stick it out until the end to see if there was something worth while. No. It still reads like an extremely lengthy argument written by a teenage debater who just discovered politics. The arguments lack nuance and are often self-referential.<br /><br />Look, I am all for alternative histories - I am a big fan of Howard Zinn, for instance. But his books are actually histories - this read like an unedited doctoral thesis from someone who hasn't mastered the difference between correlation and causation. It's obvious that the author spent a lot of time doing the research for this book and it's unfortunate that he didn't put the research to good use by constructing a compelling or even coherent argument.<br /><br />I don't usually write reviews with this much vitriol, but from the reviews, I expected a lot from this book. However, the time that I spent reading this book would have been better spent doing pretty much anything else.
B00F88U4J6|5.0|It does just what I was looking for in a  epub readers it ...Highlights in various colors, underlines and has notes.  Love it!
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|As usual Denzel give a great preformance.<br />Since this is based on a true story, it makes you think about talking to the pilot before flying.<br />Good story, keeps you intrested.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The book was fantastic!! I can't wait for the sixth book to be released.<br />All in all the whole series was great. I couldn't put them down
B00F33E3C0|5.0|Having sporadically studied a German grammar book for 6 months, I was a little nervous about beginning my first book in the language.  However, I found I had more than enough knowledge to comfortably read Cafe in Berlin.  The sentences are simple and short, yet flow nicely. Each story is only a few pages, and includes an extensive glossary.  I'd been scouring the Internet in search of free beginning German reading, but it was definitely worth the $2.99 for some quality learning material.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Liked the continued story from previous books. But didn't care for the ending would of liked it to end with hope of another book in future
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it! VERY challenging...Just when I think a level can't be done, I master it...on to next level...I have it on my phone, tablet and computer!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|My only regret is that I have to wait for book 3. I absolutely loved this book.  My favorite genre is historical fiction with some believable magic added in. This book will not disappoint. Thank you, Ms. Harkness!
B0031RS4UM|5.0|I love all the Jack Reacher books. All his books keep you guessing right to the end. Theykeep you on tenter hooks until the end and once you start reading one you can't put them down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game! I am pleased that it is now available via Amazon so I can use my kindle fire to play.
B00C7607BC|5.0|This is just the most adorable movie ever and I am so happy to have it on blue-ray and I like that I got a digital copy as well.
B00B4YAQ5A|5.0|This band only gets better with age.  A masterful album from one of the most underrated bands from the NWOHM era.  It is nice to see that these guys have not lost a step and still continue to make roaring metal anthems that rock from start to finish.  A great album from a great band.  Check these guys out if you haven't already.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again!  It's a wild unbelievable ride that includes intrigue and John's incredible imagination!  I think this might be my new favorite Grisham read!  Don't miss this one!
B00D1VKZ3M|4.0|because i love the madness in this book. the main character is chaotic and suriously as a woman i identify with her.i really enjoyed this book.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|If you have been,(and are) a fan of the original TV series, and the subsequent Star Trek movies, you will love this one. Guaranteed!! A very smart spin on the original. Sleek, great acting, excellent casting, top of the line screen play, etc. etc. etc. . If you are not a Star Trek fan, it may be time to start. My guess is J.J. Abrams has barely started. Stay tuned for more and more.
B000FC2L1E|3.0|I enjoyed this book however, it wasn't as good as the first two books, OUTLANDER and DRAGONFLY IN AMBER.  But to get to the rest of the books in the series, you have to read it.  I do so enjoy the characters in the books.  I'm a first time reader of the series.  These books, at least the first two, were the best books I've ever read!
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Dredd is &#34;dreadful&#34;, I was expecting something similar to the original Judge Dredd, with some humor.....this one was bloody and messy.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|you cannot display personal files to screen ...<br />you cannot listen to personal mp3's either<br />frame dropping while playing a video in side chrome browser
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|because of the suspense. the author tends to have lots of characters and they can be confusing at 1st but the story line makes up for that. he did not disappoint.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app has a nice combination of written, oral, and aural practice. Also, it does a nice job of mixing the words together so that I have to remember each word individually as well as phrases.<br />I knew some Spanish, which may have made this a bit easier, but other apps I've used to try to learn some Italian (for an upcoming vacation) have been little more than glorified flashcards. This app makes me recall vocabulary while actually using it, which makes it more fun and interesting, thus I am learning and retaining more.
0689505698|5.0|The stars say &#34;I love it&#34; but actually, my grandchildren like it and is one of their favorite stories for OG (old grandpa) to read . It follows a similar story line to The Three Little Pigs, but the ending is a positive one which helps their moral growth.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is entertaining and well written with a lot of thought provoking dialog.  My sons got me to read Ender's Game and I have continued to read the series.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have never read the book before. I had only seen the movie and loved it. now that I have read the book I love them both.
B0064J6P8W|4.0|Great go to movie when your looking for a good laugh in a pinch! Some nice TATA's to view as well.....
B008X6N1OA|5.0|Although this was bought for the grandchildren, I actually enjoy the Ice Age series and watch them with the gc's - many times!! Happy thoughts and positive messages conveyed in a quality presentation.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great story with lots of twists and turns. So exciting I didn't want to put it down until I finished it - classic Grisham storytelling.....<br />I can't wait for his next one!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I play this game every day.  Do not like having to pay for coins.  Wish I could earn them.  So I just do without.  Still tons of fun.<br /><br />.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Really didn't care about it too much. Just a simple movie about a pilot that drank all the time. Nothing exciting.
B00EH0K9H8|1.0|This blu - ray didin't work in my device.  I stayed so angry. But the band is Awesome. Maybe I'll buy another later.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|Brilliant little game; I've never played anything like it. If you're a perfectionists you might find the higher levers frustrating, because it can be quite difficult to get 3 stars. Still, it is a most enjoyable and engaging game.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book - he has spent hours poring over the pages. He was thrilled that it came with a minifigure. I had debated just checking it out from the library, but once I saw how focused he was on it, I realized that it was well worth the money spent!
B00FKAA3MA|1.0|My oh my this is eminem's 8th album \\"the marshall mathers lp2\\" which has about 21 tracks on here, but there's just one problem this album overall is trash none of the song's on here are any good. Why the hell is eminem rapping still this dude is complete trash a bitter empty shell of man and what makes this worse is that this is an even better time for eminem to make real raw quality hip-hop considering the state that he's in right now and use that to his advantage, but NO what do i get another awful attempt at trying to compose real hip-hop and eminem failed big time. The problem with this album also has the fact that it's nothing like his previous good albums at all, to be blunt this album should change it's name to \\"the recovery part 2\\" because that's all your're getting point blank.<br />On the \\"marshall mathers lp2\\" eminem's style and approach to this album ain't no different than his last 5 shi**y releases namely \\"encore\\", \\"the re-up\\", \\"relapse\\", \\"recovery\\" and now but not least his latest the \\"mmlp2\\" which i will definitely say his absolute worst and there's no doubt that. I mean even listening to the way eminem raps on this record is highly laughable it's a joke there is no real subject matter or true skill displayed here, he's made better record's in the past like the \\"infinite\\" album to the \\"eminem show\\" albums those were his best to date anything after was just sellout mainstream trash. Here's the thing i'm NOT being hateful i'm just keeping it real i thought that's why you eminem fans loved eminem in the first place, i mean he himself said so on \\"the way i am\\" which was also on the first \\"marshall mathers lp\\" i guess eminem fans change like the wind. Overall this album is NOT worth the recommendation to real hip-hop fans at all but if your a mainstreamer or a casual radio listener then i guess this album might pass for you.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Started out slow but started to draw attention as the plot unfolded. Would recommend to others if they were looking for a novel filled with suspense.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I like the Xbox controller way more than the PS3's setup. I purchased this controller cause of the controller lay out  and because it was wireless/rechargeable (no batteries). The controller was very easy to configure and start using, it has a USB wireless dongle that plugs into the PS3 and with a simple touch of a button on the dongle then the controller the device is synced.  So far it seems to work pretty well and I haven't noticed any problems with the controls or feel of it. Seems pretty well made for the price as well. Definitely worth $20 if you're looking for an Xbox controller layout for your PS3.
B00498YZH8|5.0|THIS MOVIE PROVES HOW TALENTED JENNIFER LAWRENCE REALLY IS. FOR HER YOUNG AGE, HER RANGE AS AN ACTOR IS IMPRESSIVE. REALISTIC STORY LINE AS WELL. GOOD JOB BY ENTIRE CAST.
1451666179|5.0|Allie is a fantastic storyteller who takes us in to the awkward crevices of he life and leaves us in tears from laughing so hard. She also educates us about her struggles and helps us understand the people  we love who suffer from depression. Her drawings are anything but simple. They are full of amazing expression.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a wonderful story, well written, very engaging. It takes you to a place and a point of view that is unusual yet compelling.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Love it, as usual Stephen King did not let me down. Recommended to those that are afraid of clowns, not much else to say.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I love this game and am totally addicted BUT Amazon are sooooo slow in issuing updates. Googleplay and I-tunes have issued the November update with the smokehouse, Amazon-not a sign of it so now I have sync problems sending and receiving free gifts. Come on Amazon get a grip!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addicting and fun.  This is my favorite game.  Even my two year olds enjoy playing it (well trying to anyway lol)
0345803493|3.0|Terrible writing and so many typos but I dealt with it and finished the trilogy. I get why so many women loved the books, especialyl since I had to finish the books but they really are poorly written. If you want to know what they're about, then just read em.
B000FC13E0|5.0|I find this book most amazing, it really informs the reader about the advances in technology to the point that it is frightening.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am totally addicted to this show! Every episode is incredible and I am eagerly awaiting the release of Season 4.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book took me way back to when it all started. The home PC revolution that began in the early 80's. I fully enjoy the walk down memory lane and the fun and unique way the story intertwined real history with future fiction. The story was fun and I could not put the book down.
0345803507|3.0|Terrible writing and so many typos but I dealt with it and finished the trilogy. I get why so many women loved the books, especialyl since I had to finish the books but they really are poorly written. If you want to know what they're about, then just read em.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's awesome I love it its so interactive the  horse is so cute it as one of the best games ever plus its free so why wouldn't you get it. I'm a kid too so this is a trustable review.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I thought the book was great.  The book started out a little slow but if you had read some of his other works you would know that he lays the ground work in the beginning so you understand the action part of the book.  He does this well in Doctor Sleep.<br /><br />If you read the book carefully, you can see references to other books that he wrote and some his son Joe Hill wrote.  there are a few references to The Shining but not many.  The story could stand alone.<br /><br />I reread The Shining before I read Doctor Sleep just to refresh my memory.  I am glad i did.  Both books are great.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I've read other reviews and I agree with those who said they were appalled that Patricia Cornwell used Sandy Hook as a background for her latest book. It felt cheap and disgusted me.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that the book had several issues. Like many of her other later novels, she includes technical details to the point of distraction and I think it takes away from the story at times.<br /><br />There are also a series of flashbacks that to me, ring false. We know too many of Kay's thoughts from the past books to believe that she had some of these feeling in the past. It is rewriting history and I don't really buy it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|To say this book was a disappointment would be an understatement.  I enjoyed the first book in the series and tolerated the second book.  I eagerly awaited this third installment only to find a poorly executed and obviously rushed job that left me incredulous and feeling extremely ripped off.  Bad writing, stupid plot, as well as characters and storylines that went nowhere.  Worst of all is the cheap shortcuts the author took with the story.  This book is dreadful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a good book I loved it but I was sad when it was over I even cried! U have to read this book
B0036S4B6M|4.0|An authentic, humble and humbling, read.  I read this before watching the Netflix series, and am so glad I did.  Kerman's got a story to tell in the book, and she does it with grace and humanity.  While the Netflix series is distracting and compelling, it seems very different than the experience and insights that Kerman shares in the book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is easy to play kid friendly and very addictive.  The story line makes it better than those other match 3 games too!
B00B3VB9TQ|4.0|Love the idealistic and futuristic concepts. Reading the second book now, can't wait to see where it takes the main character!
B00E5I2MFY|4.0|Baseline backstory for the character. Needed for the Avengers series and more.<br /><br />The second movie is better and develops the characters more than this one. Still... needed it for the complete collection.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Clint Eastwood has always done his best to entertain thousands of viewers. I haven't personally found a movie of his that I haven't enjoyed. The Dirty Harry series is classic and entertaining. It includes the typical Clint Eastwood drama with a mixture of some light comedy mixed in to the script.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|While it's unfortunate that the tool does not fit standard driver tips by default, the adapter will work fine for the most part. Just dedicate a drawer or bin for it and it's driver tips and keep them together.<br /><br />The driver and extension are good. Magnet is strong enough. Good for working with project boxes and in computer cases.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|i have been waiting for it to come out  it is just like the computer version  super awesome but the controls are hard to control
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|Alot of hype for this movie. Superman character seemed too emotionally charged. Not so much a man of steel in this particular movie.  If the director makes a sequel he had better do more research as to how superman should be. Granted the movie was a darker mood but man of steel should be have called  man of aluminum foil as the character spent most of his time on his back.
B00GEJS6GG|3.0|Yeah it just didn't do it for me. This movie just like the first one did have a lot of talking and less epic battles. Then the battles itself was like no more than 5 minutes each battle. So if you are expecting a ending(or near the ending) showdown battle where both sides are at it for like 10 or 15 mins than nope nothing to see here. I don't even think thor is all that he is hyped up to be. I'd put iron man over thor after seeing this movie. It seems like thor has become this snuggly bunny care-bear like guy with the story of this movie and even the last thor. When you think of a thor movie you think of him showcasing his god like powers and battles, instead with this movie you get a glimpse of what he could do with his power with him crying over everyone that gets a bruse on the arm.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|awesome!!!  worthy of worship.  good music in 'modern' 80's style that at the same time provides good guidance.  every song is solid, and this is different most albums now days- you don't want to listen to the whole thing through.  Something for everybody: a real zinger all the way through!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love books that I can't put down and this is definitely a book that fits that category.  Can't wait for this trilogy to arrive at the movie theater.
B0092QITO2|4.0|Good movie even if a remake. Charged and entertaining. Recommend if you like the original. Should NOT have it called it the same title though.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Ok the good is this movie is better than IM2 far as the coolness and the whole transforming into his suit like a power ranger. The story was kind of meh I didn't feel like there was a evil villian that could cause danger to iron man. Now the guy that played the vilian in 2 was preetty good and he was smart. This iron man came off as too hollywood trying to appeal to a bigger crowd, you had all the iron man clones and the chick in the iron man suit c'mon now that's overdoing it. Now iron man 1 had more action if you ask me. I think the story was good too. thus end.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This is typical Stephen King, which is not bad at all. However, following up to The Shining is a task since we love it so much. Totally creepy, scary bizarre all at once. And of course Jack Nicholson playing the lead in the movie  cemented that whole weirdness going on!<br />I wish Dr. Sleep (love the title) was a little more creepy, scary bizarre, but it was ok.<br />One thing I do always like about his books, he likes to throw in little locations, characters, memories from other previous books.<br />I'm still convinced Maine must be some kind of magnet for spooks and psychos!<br />Liked the short reference to the Game of Thrones too, kinda fun!
034537410X|5.0|I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for something nice.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Great game but if you don't want to spend money this game takes forever!  The higher you go the longer and more money it takes to do anything. Hard to send gifts to neighbors. Sometimes they can't be set because you already sent. One and didn't even know it.  Very addicting and frustrating in the time it takes to do anything.
B00A2H9OZS|2.0|Yeah this is a case of where they try to make a sequel to old movies older than 6 years. Vinny doesn't even look fearful on the cover. He even mentioned he went weak in the movie but failed to get back to his roots. I just didn't find anything badass about vinnyboy in this movie he just came off as a care-bear like guy instead of focusing on killing. Oh and his killer-unbelieavable moves just looked so unrealistic  like kicking a knife at the guy's face. so guys i would watch this movie only if you a fan of vinny and love hearing his creepy voice throughout the movie.
1416583432|3.0|Just bought the book having heard about its &#34;dog centric&#34; approach by a scientific researcher. So far I am disappointed to find contradictions incorporated into the opening chapters. It seems that the author's attempt to eliminate anthropomorphism fails, as is usual for all dog studies I have found. Admittedly, it's hard if not impossible to eliminate our too human eyes from interpretation. And it is very difficult to like dogs and study them objectively. Nevertheless, Horowitz is eminently entitled to her say. What is confounding is her pedantic writing style. This is not an easy read; it isn't because of technical terms. Rather, the flow, or lack of it makes reading this book heavy and slow. There are footnotes, which do not belong in a book meant for lay readers. Too bad. Ms. Horowitz could use a better editor. Read some of this here before you buy. Just to see if you're ready to plow through it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Strong writing and an engaging story make this a real page turner. Ms. Diffenbaugh has created a unique and fascinating character . I loved every minute!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This is a great cd.  I enjoy every track on this album.  Great music, great lyrics, highly recommended for those who enjoy alternative music
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it is a good way to pass time  but a little slow and mindless, I play it when I get bored and am waiting for someone<br />way too much hype around the game its not that good
1401938906|4.0|The book does have a list of 8 or 9 experiments to help you believe in your thoughts create your reality.  If you need something to show you as proof I recommend the book, if not, there are other books out there that say the same thing.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Enchanting story about a snow man that takes a child on a flying adventure.  I really Loved the music too.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|I REALLY enjoyed reading this book! Although the ending did leave me a bit confused and wanting more, I loved the premise and am happy to interpret the ending for myself as a reflection of the message of the story.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|no spoiler alert needed: not usually a zombie movie fan - really ww z - yeah it stands for zombie. the action keeps you glued to the screen. the actors are great. really enjoyed this dvd.<br /><br />I'm slow to move to blu-ray, kid had to get his PS3 before I started viewing blu-ray. love the combo pack of blu-ray, dvd and digital copy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Could only be better if you could keep playing and you didn't have to either pay or ask friends for more lives
B00G32QIEG|5.0|I laughed out loud repeatedly. Bridges is great and has so many one liners I lost count. I will watch it again
B00DOPEGAS|5.0|i love this item because it is the easiest way to make fashionable and fun bracelets. also are fun to ware and to share for your friend. also fun to give to your friends four their birthday or just to make for fun to give away. things to make for: brest cancer awerness,valintines day, a present for mothers day, and fathers day. i reccomend this loom bracelet maker for anyone who is crafty and loves to make bracelets
B00F4BJ4M0|3.0|Although it is interesting listening to them clown around - it is really a testimonial to George Martin and how really great he made them sound!!
B002V092M4|5.0|I found the characterisations and plot very believable, and much clearer to follow than the movie. Even though the actors were brilliant, the plot is, to my mind, too elaborate to fit into a movie of  1 or 2 hours.  I should like to see the TV mini- series with Alec Guinness.  Perhaps the multi hour format will be more true to the excellent book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Fitting end to the Hunger Games trilogy.  Enough twists to keep readers interested, but still slightly unsatisfying in the end.  I thought the characters deserved a better wrap-up.  Too much time spent with training for the final battle and the mind games and manipulation that goes handily with war.  Less time than what is deserved on how the path back is trod and made new.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King is his great again. From the start you never know where you will end up. I liked how he link so many of his other wonderful adventures together form his characters.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|rhis was a delightful story, with strong acting.  It's a great family film for all ages.  the messages are simple and clear.
B003O86FMW|5.0|i like this book because it never tells you what is going to happen next. iam only 9 and igot very interested in this series when i first read the sample of the hunger games. i go really surprised when they have to go into the arena again and that finnick is actng so stupid around katniss. i read this book 2 times and i tink my favorite part is when katniss claws haymitch in thre face with her nails
B005HJU7HA|5.0|What can I say about an auther and stories that keep one mesmerized?  I loved reading these stories, even though I had seen some of them on film.  Conan Doyle was brilliant.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Dawkins teaches us how to gain govern of our selves and our surroundings even though society and our evoluted software and hardware some times point to a easy to grasp model of the world that not necessarily depicts the world as it is. With this book we get a quite comprehensive kit to deal with this kind of issues, especially those derived from religions (as ill institutions), religious believes, fundamentalism and indoctrination, among other evils.<br />Richard humbly but fearless uncovers our lack of conscious on several aspects of our understanding and gives us tools to 'rise our conscious' and face, live and enjoy our short shot as thinking molecules structures. I think the book in its self is an impressive conscious risener.<br />Thnks Richard!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am truly I'm love with this serious. This is my second time reading it and can't put the book down! I would recommend this book to anyone. Honestly I can't help falling in love with every single word. I describe this books as a sensational, amazing, and breath taking book. I'm definitely team gale though
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book kept me on my toes the entire time. It had funny moments, romantic moments, happy moments, adventure moments, and sad moments. The entire time I felt like I was in the story next to Tris, Tobias, or one of the other characters. I also thoroughly enjoyed that some chapters were from Tris's point of view and others from Tobias's point of view.
B008602KQI|5.0|it was a great plot i really like the story line.  This was a real good movie you should watch it. kid friendly
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|That's the best word for this ap. You eventually realize that it's not just a game, but a strategy.  Keeps me coming back to defeat each level.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It's cool that u can make videos on the kindle. I really like making videos on here, it looks awesome.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|She is the most brave young girl that I'm aware of. And she continues to be very strong. This young girl has a bright future ahead... God spared her life for a reason.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I just can't get into this book.  It's been on my Kindle for months and what I've read so far doesn't appeal to me.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I really like this camera the best. Takes clear precise shots. Easy to use. Aim and click. Would reccomend this one.
B003G4W49C|3.0|While a good read, I felt this book was sad mostly. Despicable what they allowed to such young children, but also a true view what a government can be like, and who they use to their advantage. While I didn't hate the story, I'm not sure I liked it. Don't get me wrong, it's a good read, philosophical even, just the story was too sad with no real HEA. I could see this as a great educational book , classic, to read in school and discuss, especially in our quickly growing technology of a world. We are living beings and there is life out in the living world to learn about, love and enjoy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Such a beautifully written love story between two teenagers. I loved the language in which it was written, made it easier for me to read since.  Very mature characters make it a great read for adults, I'm 30, I loved it!
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love Katy Perry so much, she's my idol! I couldn't wait for it to arrive and I'm so happy it did! I ran around the house screaming for a few minutes! 10/10 Would recommend
1401938906|1.0|This book was a failure.  Only tried three of the experiments and they failed, so there was no point in continuing.  Absolutely nothing worked and I was open to it, otherwise I would not have bought it.  I did not receive any answers or &#34;gifts&#34; from the universe in the 48 hours the book said to give.  I don't understand why so many people are saying that they're having success with this.  If there is supposedly no difference between me and them (before doing the experiments), then why do the experiments fail with me?  Good thing I didn't pay full price.  Still, the point is, I wanted them to work!
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I liked this movie, and I found it to be enjoyable and funny at times.  However, the biggest thing that annoyed me about it was Jeff Bridges' accident and the way he spoke with his mouth.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I myself did not read this book, but my third grade daughter read it all by herself in just a week and then read #2 the following week.  This is a child who whines every time we suggest she read when there's &#34;absolutely nothing to do!&#34; She also is still just getting into chapter books, which I realize technically this isn't a chapter book, it's a diary, but it's about as long a book as she's willing to read while actually enjoying and understanding it.  Again, I myself have not read it yet, and I'm pretty sure there may be some &#34;bad language&#34; in here, equivalent to the &#34;bad language&#34; Junie B. Jones uses, but I'm a strong believer in &#34;Hey, at least she's reading!&#34;
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is the best hidden object game I have played in a long time. The graphics are very good. I would record this to everyone that enjoys these kinds of games.

B00AKEMHCA|5.0|The game is great because you can play with your friends by making a private match but the downer is you have to connect to Facebook .The other great things about this game are the tracks and also the special missions .The towers are great also but are even more awesome when you fully upgrade you person.The other great parts are the buildings you can get outside a match.The building help your towers(your monkeys)but I costs money to get other things.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game.  very addictive and drives my husband crazy because I play so much! would recommend it to anyone.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This chromecast is very cool! however it is limited to what it can be used on right now. we bought it so we could watch missed episodes of shows on TV however it doesn't work well for that, when you watch it off a website through the internet it stalls a lot. however if you watch stuff from you tube or from Netflix it works awesome! i am very happy with this purchase!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Love this game on line but I just wish it would quit crashing and it would b nice to be able to lie down and buy flack jackets but the best game I've played on my kindle HD so far
B006VREN86|3.0|A lot of sex- versus content<br />And of course violence.<br />For me, it is boring. But hey, that's just me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is addictive! I spend far too much time playing it. Try it -- you will like it. Well done app.

0062127241|5.0|I am so happy, first of all, that I waited for the price to come down a bit before buying this book, and second of all, that when I did make the purchase, I went with this audiobook version read by Pete Townshend himself.

It is the complete, unabridged text.<br /><br />I knew from watching a good handful of Who documentaries like [[ASIN:6303218628 Tommy: The Amazing Journey]] or [[ASIN:B00004REQZ Classic Albums: Who's Next]] that I enjoy Pete Townshend's speaking voice and narrative style, and I thought having him tell the story in his own words and voice would be the way to go.<br /><br />That is exactly right. Townshend gives a great performance, reading with charm and personality, and occasionally cracking himself up. I feel I got so much more listening to this book read by the author than I would have from reading it silently in my head.<br /><br />The book itself is great for any Who fan, and provides amusing and informative insight into how the band actually worked at the different points of its career. It is much clearer to me now than ever before just how conceptual and self-aware the Who's work was. Townshend is clearly a person who needs an intellectual or even ideological framework to organize his life and work -- this book reveals what those frameworks were at various points and how they changed over time.<br /><br />It lacks the easygoing, warm charm of Keith Richards' &#34;Life&#34;, but then again, of course it does. We did not love Pete Townshend and his work for its easygoingness or charm, but because he was able to express our angst, hopes, insecurities and longings in song and deliver them in a manly musical package with a real attitude that allowed us, too, to pretend we were tougher than we really were. This was the key, whether in the early period of &#34;I Can't Explain&#34; or later on with rocking anthems of emotion for the middle aged (or the middle aged at heart), like &#34;Love Reign O'er Me&#34;.<br /><br />In both his writing and in his reading performance, Townshend really delivers here.

B001BANK32|5.0|It's a really great book. Scary, even though I read it after reading Dr. Sleep.  One of King's best works.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Excellent story, well written. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story and wants to learn how slaves were treated.

B00DT99BX6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It begins somewhat slowly, but then moves at a rapid pace.  The author is talented and has a great deal of potential.  You can tell that this is her first novel - the quality of the writing improves throughout the book.  The premise and plot of the story are great, however, at times, the characters seem a bit one dimensional.  This is an author to watch and I've added her to my must read authors list.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|Classic Beatles. A must for any fan. A good cross between serious music and the pop culture of the rock era.  Not to be missed.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Fun sci fi action film with remarkably nicely done effects, good popcorn eating enjoyment.  The plot is not much, but sufficient for an engaging action movie.

B001BC5HXG|5.0|Though some might think this next statement pretentious, I can't help but think of this as the great American novel.  It is a very moving retelling of the Cain and Abel story with the last version actually working out the way it should with forgiveness.  &#34;Timshel&#34; - &#34;Thou mayest&#34; are words that make all seem right or correct.  All of the characters are fascinating and extremely knowable.  Some good, some bad and, of course, one truly evil.  Though Steinbeck is not considered to be in the pantheon of writers by most literary critics (many of whom felt he did not deserve the Nobel Prize for Literature), well all I can say is they are just plain wrong.  If East of Eden were the only book he wrote it would still be one of the best ever written but you have to remember that he also wrote Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men.  Compared to these three much of his other works may be considered minor but I can't help but remember never being disappointed with anything I have read by Steinbeck.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Classic Beatles from &#34;Something&#34; to &#34;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&#34;  Not to be missed for Beatles fans.  Wonderful, basic Beatles album for any student of rock or pop culture.
1455525839|3.0|Not my favorite.  To me, Cory is the weakest of Preston and Lincoln's characters.  Her dialogue is unconvincing and half of her actions just don't make any sense.  I figured out the bad guys quickly, and the action scenes were kind of boring.  Looking forward to more Vinnie and Constance.
B00F3VOL38|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the 1994 BBC release. That release consisted almost entirely of cover tunes that I'd never heard the Beatles play before. It was like getting a brand new Beatles album, and it's since become one of my core Beatles recordings. I consider it absolutely essential for any Beatle fan who wants to understand the group's roots.<br /><br />Sadly, I can't say the same for this year's new BBC disc. While the performances are as strong and lively as one would expect, the song selection disappoints. I already have the vast majority of these tracks on other albums - either the Beatles' own discs, the Anthology or the first BBC recording. Do I really need to hear another version of &#34;Sure to Fall&#34; or &#34;Till There Was You?&#34; Not really.<br /><br />And generally, I prefer the Beatles' own songs in their final, recorded versions rather than live. For instance, &#34;Please Please Me&#34; just doesn't sound right without the harmonica. The version here sounds a lot like the one on Anthology, which I've also never liked as much (and neither did George Martin, who asked John to play harmonica when they did the final recording - good decision). While it's interesting to hear songs like &#34;Misery&#34; and &#34;There's a Place&#34; played live, which I'd never heard before, neither version really improves on the final recorded versions I've come to love on the Beatles' own album.<br /><br />Same for the covers. The versions here of &#34;Boys&#34; and &#34;Words of Love&#34; are about the same as the ones you can get on &#34;Please Please Me&#34; and &#34;Beatles for Sale.&#34;<br /><br />So in the end, while the first BBC disc from 1994 is an essential, this is a CD just for someone who has to have everything the Beatles ever put on tape.<br /><br />Actually, the best Beatles' live performance of their own songs (mostly) is the Hollywood Bowl LP, which captures them playing their hearts out in the most exciting throes of Beatlemania and actually improving on the LP versions of songs like &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34; and &#34;Things We Said Today.&#34;  It's another essential. I wish that one could be tidied up and released on CD now that 36 years have passed since the LP came out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This was up and running in my apt if about 5 mins.  Very easy and for the price it's def worth it.  Hoping other apps will be able to use this soon but for now between the Chrome browser, YouTube, and Netflix, I don't have a lot of need for much else...
1476727651|5.0|Can't go wrong with Stephen. This book is a grea sequel to The Shining. I'm 3/4 of the way through and can't wait to get back to it every time I put it down!
B00F3VOL38|5.0|It is great to see new and fresh Beatles product out there..... I've always loved the Beatles' BBC material... I remember growing up in the 80's and discovering who these guys were. I'd travel to record shops to find bootleg LPs on the BBC material. Much of the stuff was presented in a very distorted, faint, recording that had you turn up the volume to hear past the crackling... I have the Complete BBC recordings box set, the quality is superb, but it's also good to see these get released legitimately..<br /><br />Besides U2, I don't believe there are anymore rock bands (guitars, drums, bass) out there making new music that is actually topping the charts..  We are in a world of Pop music now....<br /><br />Hollywood Bowl next??
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Disc 5 for season two had a small but deep scratch. I didn't initially see it until one of the episodes kept freezing at a certain spot. Other than that, it is great.
0316204366|5.0|incredible insights into what a small company can do.<br />easy reading, it speaks to so many contemporary business problems and management processes.<br />page turner.<br />cant say enough about this author and the content of his thoughts.<br />but did get lost in the civil rights issues a little bit
B004H4XL7E|5.0|The best book on the sales pitch process ever written.<br /><br />Chapter One can be an entire book in and of itself. I use it and share it every day/
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought it was very good and sad, but I'm very glad she picked who she did to love because he made her happy
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Kinda wish there was a redo on this book.  Waited so excitedly for it to come out and it was... boring.  And the end sucks!
B00BAXFAJC|4.0|Quite an investment in time and the writing style is quite descriptive and poetic at times. What struck me the most is that this was written by a 27 year old! What an extraordinary accomplishment at such a young age (at any age for that matter).<br /><br />While the book may have been a bit of work at times - it was work that I felt was well invested as the author composes literature as opposed to entertainment, and every so often we need a little bit of literature to remind us how very creative exceptional authors are!<br /><br />I do feel that the author could have used 60-75% of the words and accomplished a more &#34;readable and appealing&#34; script for the masses- but then perhaps that was not her intention. The long and short of it was this book was a historical fiction that embodied colorful and diverse characters that brought the age and time together. Well done!<br /><br />I will keep my eyes out for Ms. Catton's works in the future.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie is amazing! It follows the first book very well. Great casting and I can't wait for the sequel this week!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Anyone who dreams of running their own business should be required to read this book. People who don't get it will tell you it is all about money, and indeed, without cash flow this would be a very different story. But there is much more to an  entrepreneur. You have to want to change the world. Few succeed, but sometimes someone comes along who fixes what wasn't broken, and we are all better off because of it.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|This book had me completely engrossed the entire time and I still can't stop thinking about it. Great plot, story and the you really begin to care about all of the characters deeply! I am always looking for longer books that can keep me engaged, and this one will not disappoint.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I think it was ok:) so much fun reading this book by Nicole age nine lived in San Francisco:) very good book
B006LSZECO|5.0|NO CHORES DONE, JUST GOOD LISTENING!!!!!!! The readers were very good. Gillian sure knows how to keep the surprises coming.
B00170DEM8|1.0|I love the movie but I attempted to download it on HD and when it didn't I download I refresh when back to the original window, download the non-HD version and then received the HD version and was charged TWICE one for the HD download and one for the non-HD download. I don't see provisions to appeal this matter.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Amazing book. Very emotional but an incredible read! I believe everyone should read this book because it really does change your view on the world.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Really liked this movie, showed the hypocrisy that happened, how much racism there really was even when there wasn't suppose to be. The story line was beautifully written, the period costumes and settings were very appropriate for that time.<br />It broke my heart to watch just a mere glimpse of how poorly people were treated by the white, rich folks and how the non-whites were looked down on.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Stephen Kings' Doctor Sleep would have been rated a 5 star, if he would have cut out a few boring chapters in the middle of the book!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Most books I read are kind of depressing but this book was uplifting without being sappy.  Terrible things happen to Auggie but it's all good in the end.
B0049P1N3K|5.0|I'm embracing the power and cannot believe how it has changed my life. Highly recommend for anyone wishing to have a fulfilled life
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Great read. Important story to remember the cruelty of slavery in America. Gresham does it well
1603420398|5.0|I have probably done a little over a third of these different motifs and I would highly recommend this book.  For me, a newbie to crochet, could easily understand the directions and diagrams.  I plan on completing one of every motif and will enjoy every one until I do so.
B00END9DQC|5.0|Jessie J is one of the most talented musicians of her generation and she does not disappoint with this album! I was a huge fan of her first CD, but she stepped it up 100% with 'Alive'. It's amazing how much she has grown as a vocalist and performer, especially when she had proved her enormous talent from the start. This album has been on repeat since it came out, and it's one of those albums in which you never want to skip over a song. I cannot say enough positive things about it- please do yourself a favor and buy this CD!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It's a neat idea.  It was fun sending home movies from the PC to the HDTV.  But the lag was pretty bad.  I hope they add more support for other apps.  I think I jumped on the google bandwagon a little too soon.  I don't find myself using it very much, but I'm sure they will keep making it better.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|This one I just couldnt finish. I found it had too much gore, too many gruesome details. I usually love the Pendergast books (he is such an interesting character), but I felt this one had Pendergast overpowered by all the gruesome stuff. I always think it's a bad sign for the progress of an author's  creativity, when they try to hook you with extreme events and emotions instead of pure, entertaining writing. I hope this is not the case for these authors.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This felt like it had to be written by someone familiar with living and/or loving someone with cancer. It was real and difficult and beautiful, but in the end I think it was too real for me to &#34;escape into with enjoyment&#34;. I felt obligated to read it--to stare the ugliness in the face. And while I can't fault the book/story, it isn't a journey I'd normally choose to take.  That being said, it kept me engaged the whole story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book! Hugh Howey took me on a true adventure and I could not wait to have time to read more. I am so glad I have two more books to read in this series. I was so inspired by Juliette and after every chance to read more of the book, I had very thought provoking what if moments. Thank you Hugh Howey for putting your imagination to paper or in my case on my Nook screen!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|So far so good. I like this app. I use it a lot and find it to be very useful and easy to use.This is one I recommend.
0440246016|3.0|This was a weaker effort than the other Jack Reacher books I've read. I expect better than this.  Reacher is supposedly smart as well as deadly. In this book  he and his team ignore obvious leads that made me shake my head. Any investigator would at least  have checked them out. One small example. They are attacked on the street and kill the attacker. They find only his car keys. Instead of using the remote to find the car which has to be in the area, they decide they'll go home and sleep. Unbelievable. And it happens over and over. If this was a series about a dumb guy who somehow bulls his way through, it might have been funny. As it was, I can't figure out why the author keeps undermining his story and characters.<br />Read another book in the series. Save this for when you are desperate.
B007OV6AT8|1.0|I've liked all of the Dalgliesh books so far but this one bored me. I found myself skimming most of it and didn't really care about the mystery or any of the characters
B006LSZECO|4.0|Enjoyed this book. It was something out of the ordinary. Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a quick but engrossing story.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I have this story in both hardback and kindle. From the first time I read this story when my daughter was born many many years ago to reading it again today, this still makes me cry. This is every mother's deep heart felt wish, hope, and dream.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|The picture and colour on Blu Ray is great and worth the money especially with the special features on Blu Ray format. I was watching Raiders of the lost Ark on VHS tape back in 1980 and I did not like it because of the colour and picture quaility back then.
B00G4NUQYM|5.0|great app lots of levels, many features love the challenge of solving the words, keep up the good work. I disabled my Wireless and the app still runs fine :)
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I thought that this app really sucked. It seems that the free version is extremely downgraded from the regular version. It was weird to operate it and not at all helpful, so I deleted it.
B002DW92SE|4.0|Found it a bit boring, maybe I'm couldn't relate to the characters as other reviewers said. I was still intrigued by the story but the ending was predictable. I prefer other Hornby books.
006202406X|4.0|I fully don't understand the plethora of negative reviews. Sure, maybe it wasn't quite as good as Divergent (or even Insurgent), but the book was good. I have to think that the people who negatively review based on the ending missed the entire point of the the story and the message the author meant to send with the ending...there is nothing more pure than sacrificing yourself for someone you love and for a cause you believe in. Sure, everyone loves a neatly presented happy ending, but that's generally unrealistic. I understood the ending and I accepted it. It made me feel a deep sense of loss and sadness, but that's okay. A book that makes you feel is a good book, even if that feeling is sadness.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|getting my collection together.  i love this movie even after he took her power she still found a way to win.
B00D82BNLC|4.0|This book was so much fun! The main character is someone I liked right away. The writer did a great job with the background stuff, so by the time things ramp up with the plot I was IN. The premise was great, and with so many shows and movies now about paranormal activity, it was totally believable. Being on a paranormal investigation team is now on my bucket-list.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the next installment!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! Wanted to read it before the movie! Took me a couple chapters to get into it but once I did...totally hooked!! Can't wait to read the next!
B009NY43NY|5.0|...it could not have been more beautifully written! I'm utterly content; thrilled actually! If ALL good things must end, then I'm so glad this was The End. Thank You Charlaine Harris, for letting us know Sookie Stackhouse & her world!
B0073U2FB2|3.0|confusing and i don't understand it yet.  but i will after i watch it a couple of times.  hard to follow
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|It's an okay game. Gets a little boring at times but it was free. My kids like to plat it.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|An oldy, but a goody!  This album has a lot of great hits along with other songs that are fun and energetic to listen to.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Highly recommended conclusion to the WoT series.  Sanderson kept me at the emotional edge of my seat the entire time.  It was intelligent, well written, and exactly what I've come to expect from this great author.  Thank you for this book.  My world was both brightened by having read it and saddened that one of my most favorite series has come to a deserved and thrilling finale.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|awesome musical about a woman who wants to be treated equal to a man.  the song are great and i learn a little every time i watch it.
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Played the original version several times through on armorgames. Figured I'd give this one a shot. Love the hero system. This game has always hit the sweet spot of cute/violent graphics and great gameplay.<br /><br />I wish I could pinch zoom more on the tablets. It's a silly decision, tactically, but it would be cool to see the troops in the killzone close up.<br /><br />Keep it up!
B00ERIUO1G|4.0|Prism may be Katy Perry's best album yet.  A great mix of creative songs.  Ballods, pop,rap, and more make them all great to listen to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game. I have it on my iphone and on my kindle fire. cant get enough of it. Im on level 300 something and play everyday
0792839749|4.0|great musical.  it's about a flying car that takes them on many adventures.  awesome songs.  great to keep kids entertained for hours
B00275EHJG|5.0|The kids and I love this movie. It is actually better than I thought for a 3rd movie in the series.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I love this game because the best thing about it is that you can knock down cars, and also it's free.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|its a good book, when you can manage to read it. To me it was a bit choppy and jumpy in the writing style , but I finished and enjoyed it.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|this movie is one of my favorites.  my nieces and nephews are big fans of this movie.  the music and the birds are just fun.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Very cute movie. Nice to see some variety in the Disney princesses. My younger daughter loves it, but I think it's been displaced by Tangled.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every woman needs to read this book immediately, and then pass it along to a trusted male. Hits so many nails on the head. Love the questions for discussion included at the end.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Nice graphics and very easy to play for grade school kids.  They will have many hours of play and fun.
B002M37OXO|3.0|i have become a fan of anicent aliens and i want to read what he has to say about the civilizations that came before us and how smart they really were.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I think this is a great movie with an excellent story. m,y kids liked it too, but the little one (5) didn't necessarily understand it very well. Recommended for 10 and up.
B00C7DGQ9C|3.0|The preview contained most of the good parts.  The two main actors seemed bored with their roles and most of their lines seemed to lack any emotion.  Also, I am a bit confused.  Hansel and Gretel are suppose to be these great and feared witch hunters; yet they seem to get their behinds handed to them in the majority of their battles.  The battles were even a bit lackluster even though the director seemed to like the &#34;Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon&#34; style of fighting.  The two main characters had quite the potty mouth which seemed odd since it did not enhance the moment nor did it make them seem tougher.  The profanity used by them seemed out of place and odd.  The witches were a bit odd with the white face make up and black lines making them look like a cracked egg. Some of the weapons were slick while others looked plastic and unimpressive.  The whole movie seemed a bit off.  It wasn't good but it wasn't horrible, it just lacked a lot.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I adored the premise of this movie, and it's hard not to get behind that much star power. If you're looking for a popcorn movie with action/adventure, humor, a little romance, and Helen Mirren being a total bad--well, you know what--this this is the movie you've been looking for. This movie was a ton of fun.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|RED 2 is Excellent…Funniest action movie I have seen in a long time, if not THE BEST.  Great acting, great cast. This is a MUST SEE movie.  You should see RED first if you haven’t already.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|Movie is OK. The kids like it better than I do. Haven't read the book, so I can't compare it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I like this app so much and I advise you to try to play it! It's fun! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It will suck you in and you will be addicted! Some times it's maddening but it's always fun. Have fun!
B00FAZ01JU|5.0|This is the one to get if you want the entire concert.  (The alternative CD/DVD combo includes only about half the songs in the concert.)  My rating is based on the concert itself as watched on PBS, because I have not yet received my DVD.  If the DVD does not meet my audio/video quality expectations after I have received it, I will come back and change my rating.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/23/2013-  I received my DVD today from Deep Discount DVD CD.  The package states Region Code:  0 (All Regions).  It plays beautifully on my player.  The full concert is included.  This concert is a true delight to see and hear!
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I think this movie's kind of dumb, graphics are pretty good, and the kids like it, hence the 4 stars.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|This is John Grisham as only he can tell a legal story. This one is about a very wealthy, dying old man, who leaves a fortune to his housekeeper and cuts the rest of his family out of his handwritten will, before committing suicide. Need I say more.....
B0089LOG02|5.0|The first two sentences of the prologue made me want to read it.  &#34;I believe in ghost.  They're the ones who haunt us, who left us behind.&#34;
B00E8S2JZ4|4.0|The &#34;extended edition&#34; of the hobbit: an unexpected journey comes in a sleek package that won't disappoint. The image you see on amazon is the cover however the blu ray + ultra violet banner on top is only a cardboard piece that can easily be removed. As for the film itself, it has its ups and downs. The theatrical release deserves a solid 8/10 alone, this version contains an extra 12 minutes of footage (compared to the LOTR 30-60 minute additions) some of which is just as great as the rest of the movie and adds more depth to the scene while a few others had their reasons for not making the original cut.<br /><br />Positive additions<br />I specifically liked MOST of the scenes added in Rivindale. This is where a good portion of the footage has been added. Most of it serves to just show the clashing cultures of the dwarves and elves. Bilbo is also seen walking around the city more and we catch glimpses of a few familiar items. Gandalf and Elrond are also shown discussing the quest in more detail which adds to the story. Various small scenes throughout the film are fine and don't necessarily detract or add to the film overall.<br /><br />Negative additions<br />In my opinion the goblin king's song is just stupid. The two songs sung by the dwarves in the original cut flow well and actually make sense (the dishes clean up songs shows the merry attitudes of the dwarves and further pronounces Bilbo's annoyance and the song of the misty mountain sets the tone for their adventure) but this part feels like more of a flash mob than anything else. HOWEVER, some may like this addition because i believe the song is in the book. The dwarves are also shown naked at a distance in Rivendale which is stupid and unnecessary but may yield a laugh for some.<br /><br />I have yet to go through all of the behind the scenes material but so far I believe it deserves a 10/10 as all the LOTR extended behind the scenes disks did.<br /><br />Overall I would buy this version of the filmover the original just because I’m a huge Middle Earth fan boy but if you are the casual movie goer who liked this film it shouldn't make much of a difference whether you purchase this version or the original cut.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|AWSOME MOVIE, JUST A CLASSIC, THAT WILL NEVER BE MADE AGAIN. YOU WILL NEVER SEE THE CURRENT CROP OF PRODUCERS EVER TOUCH THE LINES IN THIS MOVIE.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a fantastically fun and demented game!  It definitely takes off from similar popular media in which the threat of disease is the ultimate enemy of humankind.  Think movies &#34;World War Z&#34; and &#34;28 Days/Weeks Later.&#34;  I personally enjoyed testing the ins and outs of creating a &#34;Kill Everyone!&#34; disease--be deadly, but not to fast...take it slow.  But, the app really took off as both my kids and parents joined in with advice and cheers as new nations were eliminated!  All in all, the graphics are good and very doable on smaller phone screens.  The sound effects are minimal yet very effective--as is the ticker-tape news of world woes and triumphs.  In the end, very fun and very much worth buying.
B00BAXFCPO|4.0|interesting approach to health and diet. I yt? think I will give it my best effort and see what  happens.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I had never read about this man for whom this marvelous new electric Tesla car is for. He really was a very interesting person. This book also sheads light on some of our other persons of history. My husband also liked this. We had some good conversations about it. Made me want to know more.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app worked great until I updated.  The app had an update in the system but since i updated it tells me that facebook has stopped working and force closes.  i deleted it off of the device and reloaded and still have the problem.  Don't update if you like to use it
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|I got it when it was free for halloween...it is fun when you need something to pass the time...so for that price it's wonderful
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game! Fun options for customization like deck design. Addictive from the beginning. Nice options also for customized game play (like rule options).
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Great. Hooks me up and works great. It's a necessity if you have a device that uses it. I recommend these types of connectors
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This is likely the one and only romance movie I like. The cast was incredible and the movie was very easy to follow. You quickly become involved in the various intertwined stories. Enough said.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|waste of my PRECIOUS time. How can they turn Four inTO such a pathetic character after building him into a wonderful person? I hated so much what they turn Four into and this has got to be the frist book i fast-foward with my kindle. this book was such a waste of time and the end of Tris, well that is just not worth even mentioning. One of the worst book i have ever read.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Such a great end to the awesome series!  I was so excited for this book to come out after reading the other two and it did not disappoint!
B009X01FJS|4.0|I just got my cover. It is really nice, but heavy. It is tricky, however, and positions my Kindle very easily. I think once I've gotten used to it, this rating will go up.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game to pass the time with while doing something else.  Can be fairly addicting to start with, and as the timers get longer have to fight the urge to spend money.
B00GOQ9M4O|5.0|I continue to enjoy this series.  Can't imagine watching anything else on a Sunday night.  Love that should I miss it for any reason, I can catch it the next day here on Amazon.
B00GOQ9M4O|2.0|First off I love the Walking Dead butttttt this was not the show we all fell in love with . If this had been the show the whole time we would not be here talking about it . So guys take a note because if this is the direction of the show pack your bags you won't get another season . So please get back on track the show should have many more season to go . Look at shows like the XFILES and STARGATE when you start messing with new actors and story lines the end is near .
B00EN6RSXO|5.0|I chose this book simply because I'd never read it. I ended up loving it. In fact, I ended up doing a bit of research into author and story just to satisfy my reading experience. Very well written with continual fascination.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Funny installment to the series! Children will enjoy this if they have seen 'Monsters Inc.'. Billy Crystal was just as funny as ever.
B00AGKH45I|5.0|This is a very good edition of a very good record. As many of you should know, Rumours is a clasic and I think every clasic album must have his espcial edition. Well, now, Rumours has the edition it deserves.<br />I would like to say that for me the special thing here is the vinyl, maybe because it makes me remember those days, and because is a great edition with a great sound.
B000NV55RY|2.0|Honestly, this movie is boring and not funny.<br />There are two things good about it: (1) Sharon Tate is in it, and (2) the set was beautiful, which is why I've given it 2 stars.
B0093AV8IQ|5.0|great movie… I remember going to the cinema many moons  ago to see this movie an how it impressed me. When the recent release was shown, the trailers didn't do well for me so I was prompt to search this original… very happy to have found it.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|The story was interesting, and the CGs were very good. Will Smith's acting was a little over the top, but Jaden was very good.
B00785P2QC|3.0|A nice game<br /><br />Addictive game would get more stars if you didn't have to purchase dollar's to buy and expand your city
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Just really starting to get into the game and it will not allow me to continue playing because it's requesting to be updated yet there is no update options.REALLY!!!!!!
B000SGSU58|5.0|I like a book that keeps my interest, all of the Harry Bosch books are great. Please keep writing these great books
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Got this for my kids and they love it. Even thought we've solved all the levels, my youngest goes back and replays the levels again.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Actually my rating should be four and a half stars. Would have been five, but the scene with Spock and Kirk after Kirk 'saved' the ship was not performed as well as in the movie with the original cast...but that is only my opinion. Aside from that tiny con, no pun intended, J.J. Abrams and cast did a wonderful job with the spin on the original movie with the same villain. I just hope they don't 'save whales' in the next one; and I do hope there is a next one.
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|We literally waited for years for Disney Planes to come out because we saw the preview on another Disney movie. We went and saw it in the theater but my son didn’t really like the 3D effects so we were even more eager for the DVD/Blu-Ray to come out! At last it has arrived!<br /><br />As I suspected, Reed is much more excited about the movie now that he can watch it like normal without the 3D effects. He has watched it over and over again and it has become his new favorite movie. He is already making a list of all the Planes that he wants for Christmas.<br /><br />Personally, I was a bit disappointed as I thought that it was too much like Cars, only with Planes. The storyline was so similar that it lacked originality. It’s still well made because it’s Disney and it has it’s usual array of colorful amazing characters. I just wish the storyline wasn’t much like Cars.<br /><br />Nonetheless, what matters is my kids and they adore it and never once said “this reminds me of the movie Cars.” So when it comes to the critics that matter, Reed and Paige have spoken and they love Disney Planes!
B000AHJJDM|5.0|I never get tired of listening to this album. I had my first listen to it 7 years ago. Since then it has been the album that I consistently would go back and listen to at least once a month. I especially like the side with Brothers On a Hotel Bed. I believe this wouldn't have been such a great album if there were the constraints of vinyl seeing the large on used spaces on multiple sides due to the length of the songs.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. Played something similar on my kindle keyboard, but this is so much more fun in color.
B009POCG2C|5.0|One of Clint Eastwood's better movies. I've watched it several times and have enjoyed it each and every time. No critic here, just one man's opinion...it is a great movie.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|Since I grew up on the Smurfs I was really excited to share The Smurfs movie with my kids. We didn’t get a chance to see it in the theaters so I wanted to check out the Blu-ray before Smurfs 2 came out.<br /><br />While the characters are the same, the Smurfs are almost unrecognizable from the show of my youth! It’s just another reminder of how far technology has come! They look amazing in Blu-Ray. They came alive on the screen and my kids and I really enjoyed watching this together.<br /><br />I wasn’t sure how my four and five year olds would feel about it not being completely a cartoon. The beginning mostly is so they were completely absorbed but when the humans entered, they did lose a little bit of interest and kind of wandered in and out of the room. I actually sat through the whole thing because I wanted to see what would happen!<br /><br />I loved Neil Patrick Harris in this and have always enjoyed his acting. Gargamel was perfectly cast with Hank Azaria and was exactly what I imagined him to be. My daughter loved Azrael even though he was a “mean kitty.” They really captured the essence of the original characters with their human (and animal) counterparts.<br /><br />As an unexpected bonus, there was also a Smurfs Christmas movie included. It was so cute and original and my daughter has made this her new favorite holiday flick!<br /><br />While the human side didn’t interest my kids as much as the lovable Smurfs, they still ask to re-watch it and are ready to go see Smurfs 2!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|To be frank I started reading this only after I found out that it was picked up by HBO and I don't usually pick up fantasy books due to their usually predictable story-lines and the sheer thickness. But A Song of Ice and Fire got me hooked and I believe it is because of the following:<br /><br />The chapters are written in point of view styles from different characters. Even minor characters sometimes get a cameo. This makes it a great read because it instantly widens the breadth of the book's setting and sometimes it emphasises how certain characters are unaware of information that we the reader already know making it quite a page turner.<br /><br />Also, it is certainly not predictable. I will avoid spoiling it for those who have not read or seen the show. So do read it to find out!<br /><br />And lastly with a Kindle, the thickness of the book isn't really that much of an issue. I can bring it almost anywhere i go without all the bulk and before I knew it, I was already finished with it and can't wait to start on the second book.
1741794609|4.0|This guide is colorful and exciting to read. The information is well organized and there are even sample itineraries at the beginning of the book. I ordered this book and the &#34;Rough Guide&#34; book for comparison and this one is definitely better!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I guess the hero cannot always live, so I did and did not like the ending. Part of me felt she should have lived, and part of me is okay with her dying because as all the main characters cannot keep living and being the superhero all the time.
B00A7ZHGS2|2.0|it was a movie that was gloried up and not worth  it action. might as well be watching the zombie move which that is what it was like
B00BGGIW2K|4.0|This music is good to chill to. Sometimes this album is classified under electronic music which is fine but the way it sounds certainly doesn't sound like what most people expect when they hear electronic music. It is not daft punk or Moby but more jazz like Sade. Certainly worth a listen from start to finish although I would say that the opening two songs Open and The Fall are the best and sets the tone very nicely for the rest of the album.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I started reading this book on a Sunday afternoon and didn't get off the sofa till I'd finished it. This gripping story is a page turner. I'm looking forward to read the next Stevenson's book.<br />I highly recommend.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Love this app.<br />It came in real handy when we first lost our power during Super Storm Sandy.<br />My sister had her kindle on and it &#34;I up the whole room.<br />That's when I decided to download this torch app onto my own kindle fire.<br />Now when I know bad weather is coming I make sure my Kindle Fire is the first thing charged.<br />Best part is, it's LED torch.
0064430227|5.0|This book has been very popular in our household, from the 6 yr old, all the way down to the 2 yr old (waiting to see what baby thinks)...very cute pictures, imaginative story, easy to read, and keeps their attention. We ordered another in the series after reading this because our kids liked it so much! The basic gist is that the baby makes up his own adventures using the crayon to draw them as he goes...so if he needs a road to get somewhere, he draws it and walks along, until he needs a tree, and draws that. Then a dragon to guard the tree...etc. Very cute. Will get more, I'm sure. Wish I'd known about these when our oldest few were smaller!
B00BMTX2J4|4.0|A hauntingly close to perfect record from start to finish. The songs all generally feel very cohesive from start to finish and the lead singer's vocals are perfectly executed for the lyrics. The songs all seem to flow into one another which makes the album a joy to listen to from start to finish.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|I have used this Gmail to work between my computer and Kindle.  Have been able to do many work related items with this.
B00COMLLX2|2.0|I'm not too crazy about this app. Doesn't quite interest me much. Thinking about deleting it from my device.<br />Runs well but not exciting game to me.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|Easy to use. I share my kindle Fire HD with my wife, who is not as technically inclined as I am. This photo editor is both user friendly and powerful. The UI is intuitive and photos can be touched up quickly.  The meme generator is a lot of fun to use with sites like Facebook. So this photo editor is a great app for both of us.
B0015435OI|4.0|Granted I would not recommend the whole album to most people since the style of music can be rather long drawn out and boring for most people. However the few stand out tracks i would recommend are The Rip and Magic Doors.<br /><br />When I got the record at first I did not realise that it was a 45rpm and played it at 33.3rpm and it sounded strangely soothing and it seemed even more depressing. However it made me really fall in love with songs like The Rip even more. [...]<br />The fact that someone uploaded it on youtube shows that I might not be the only one who felt that way.
B004EYSXT8|2.0|Nothing really new here. It pretty much tells you what you (should) already know. You want to get good at something? Repeat it over and over. Correcting mistakes as you go.<br />It bangs on about the process that happens in your brain. Ie. myelin forms.<br />But essentially if you want to be talented. Then practice.<br />Can I have my money back please?
B008A1B5Z0|5.0|This app really works great on my Kindle Fire. It scans very quickly and frees up quite a bit of space.<br />I recommend the Smart Ram Booster to everyone who owns a kindle.
0385351399|5.0|This book is fascinating and terrifying at the same time. I have listened to the audio version of this novel - a story of social media and networking and the perils of having every minutia of your life visible to the whole world. Though fiction it is not far removed from a possible reality.<br /><br />I promise you that you will never post the same way again after reading this.
B00DJ80VLS|2.0|I would consider myself a diehard DT fan. I've gone to pretty much every concert, bought every album, and loved them ever since Images and Words. Generally speaking some of their albums have been a bit better then others, but all of them have been in my opinion great, with some standout songs on every album. Every album had several songs where there would be just a crushing riff that you anticipated with glee every time you heard it and interspersed with that were long but interesting musical interludes, but still mostly melodic and that were memorable. I have to say it's nice to finally be able to hear John Myung play. There is no questioning there musicianship especially Rudess and Petrucci. But for me this album is a letdown, personally I can't get into it. I've listened to it multiple times, but it's just not that engaging for me. I figured since they wrote A Dramatic Turn of Events without Portnoy this album would be similar and have memorable tracks like Outcry and that Portnoy's absence wouldn't affect them. I hope that the next album they go back a little bit to having a bit more memorable songs and riffs that blend together and don't seem so disjointed. I also must say that even though Portnoy could be a bit overbearing in terms of social media and his whining and  also his going to AX7 and then changing his mind and wanting to come back was lame, and I don't blame them for not taking him back. He is a way better drummer then Mangini. He had the ability to write drum tracks that were almost memorable by themselves. His fills were unique and his ability to use his splash cymbals and double bass patterns were unique. I know Mangini is technically a monster, but I don't think he is even close to Portnoy in terms of creativity. I hope someday they can bury the hatchet and get back together.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|UNO the classic game on the go. I just cannot get enough. It is so much fun. I only wish they gave you more free coins.
B0055S348W|5.0|Pricey but worth it. As long as your printer is accessible through wi-fi it just works like it's supposed to. The only drawback is that printing web pages is a little cumbersome. I tried all of the free printer apps I could find. None worked. This does. My wife thinks I'm a hero. I can live with that.
B00CDTSQZW|5.0|Totally and completely loved this series.  We don't have TV so we wait for the season to come out on DVD....eagerly waiting for season 2.  I was not aware of this series but found it while perusing Amazon for something else and ordered it because of my love of history and was curious as to how closely it came to the real thing.  I was impressed.
B00CXQL828|5.0|I found out about this album mainly from following Portnoy since I'm a DT fan. I admit I'm more of a metal guy, but like hard rock. When they said they were aiming for an old school rock sound, I was a little worried. I aways appreciated Kotzen's and Sheenan's musicianship. I have to say this album is really a pleasant surprise. I am impressed that almost every single song is a keeper and very memorable. Kotzen has an amazing voice and it's nice to hear him let loose and get back to shredding a bit rather then just play bluesy stuff. I hope these guys stay together and keep churning out albums.
B003U69IX6|5.0|Loved the movie, was a good movie for everyone to be able to gather!!! Great Family Movie!! Will definitely watch again!
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Great book. Good story line and characters. Kept me intrigued throughout the entire book. Already started the second in the series (just finished this book yesterday). The author creates a world that you understand and don't want to leave.

B001DHXT20|4.0|Beware gamma-sickness, and don't drink the imported Guarana Soda stored in Stan Lee's refrigerator, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br /><br />\\"The best way to control your anger is to control your body,\\" learns Dr. Bruce Banner. Edward Norton gently altered the intelligent script to artfully integrate The Hulk's narrative. Norton brings a level of pathos and depth to his role. I first became interested in watching this film after seeing Mark Ruffalo's distinctive version in [[ASIN:B008NCSZQ8 Marvel's The Avengers]]. Ruffalo will be reprising his role in Joss Whedan's sequel in 2015, \\"Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron.\\"<br /><br />This chapter in The Hulkdom oeuvre does not disappoint, as Ang Lee's version did. Watch for a great cameo by Lou Ferrigno (Hulk's voice too), another little bit of twisted Stan Lee humor with Banner working in Stanley's Pizza Parlor, and the corrupted Dr. Samuel Sterns (the great Tim Blake Nelson, memorable as Delmar, loved-up and turned into a horny toad in [[ASIN:B00003CXRM O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]). The one negative is that the film feels like it was wrapped-up abruptly. It begins vividly, with Norton's Dr. Banner/The Hulk hiding out in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, desperately searching for a cure while for his Hulk-condition while collaborating with the mysterious \\"Mr. Blue,\\" and loyally protected by his super-smart dog companion. The end is not as strong; it would have helped to have a final scene with Banner waking threadbare and footloose, trying to cope with closure with Betty (Liv Tyler), his angst, and survival.<br /><br />Sometimes, life can be so stressful that folks just need a little fun entertainment. Enjoy!

I have never had any issue with this app and I downloaded it to my phone as well. It is so much easier than going online and finding the website.

B008JFUPFI|5.0|I don't know where all the hate and negativity about this movie is coming from, but let me tell you, this movie was the best Superman movie that I have seen. People need to quit comparing Man Of Steel to the old Superman movies. Those movies to me were too cheesy and did not care for them. As for this new Superman movie, I agree, it should have received better reviews from the critics and respect that it has gotten. I have seen MOS six times at the movie theatre and i enjoyed every minute of it. There was noting flawless about it. I just received my dvd and watched it again this past weekend with my mother,and we both stil enjoyed it.<br /><br />Zach Snyder and his team took this reboot to a whole new different feel. I love that it had good acting, lots of action and it showed a more human side to Superman with feelings, along with emotions this time around. You cannot expect and have every Superman movie to be the same. This is 2013 and it's time there is an upgrade to Superman this time around. In this film, he is just beginning to understand who he is and learning of his powers.<br /><br />Second, please stop comparing Henry Cavill to Christopher Reeves. Both are totally different and did their own thing. Each actor portraying this Superhero is going to have their town take on how to do their Superman. Like some haters keep saying Henry Cavill is not that great as Christoper Reeves was. Well, with all do respect, Henry Cavill did an excellent job with his persona. He truly is Superman himself. This man truly earned it and work hard to transform himself for a perfect fit for the role. To me that is dedication, by looking at the workouts he had to go through. He nailed it and definately showed a bad-ass side to Superman during his fight scenes with Zod. I like Henry Cavill and i hope in the next MOS sequel, he brings his best performance to the characters Clark/Superman,given that the script will give him more to work with to show you he can do this role more justice. As for Amy Adams, I for one am glad she was chosen to play Lois Lane. Her character was tough and not this damsel in distress annoying reporter having to be rescued every moment by Superman that we have always saw in past movies and television. Even after she found out who he was, she showed a lot of support to clark by helping him to deal with his situation and his kryptonian people.<br /><br />This movie is well worth it and can't wait for the sequel .I am not to keen on seeing Ben Affleck as Batman (not a fan). I will not be supporting Afflect, but the original cast. This could really be the one that will ruin it.

B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone wanting to seriously clean up their diet.  The food industry continues to mess with our food and we continue to &#34;swallow&#34; their meddling hook, line, and piece of bread.  Wheat, and any other product made with wheat, is a big reason for many of the life style diseases Americans suffer from.  We are addicted to our food thanks to the food industry and this book explains what happened to one of the basic, and dare say, most loved ingredients in our diet.
B00EUS9JF0|2.0|Not impressed . When he came out and gave One Direction praise  in order to push his album I said he lost his mind . This album to me proves it . Nothing really impressive since Lennon died . Paul go take a break . Have to admit though your live shows are amazing .

B008WU02HG|5.0|First of all let me say that I'm a huge mana fan. This album contains remastered hit singles from the band as well as their newer music. Overall can't complain about anything. Great music, great band.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|Great to see the story that led to the TV series and to reflect how the character Nev has grown and developed to play almost a counselor role today. Would be entertaining by itself, but definitely more meaningful within the present context.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|Sanderson has written epic fantasy, futuristic fantasy and now apocalyptic fantasy. Perhaps a common theme is the use of great power and how one combats evil. The narrative voice, David, is scarcely accidental, and he is faced with a truly gargantuan Goliath. David is a great hero. Smart, courageous, but humble enough to do a s he's told (most of the time.) the other characters are all distinctive, but some, like Prof., Cody and Megan are more fully fleshed out than Tia and Abraham. Beautifully written, as always. A pleasure to read. The art seems effortless. Robert Jordan knew what he was doing when he nominated Sanderson as one of the most brilliant talents emerging in the field. A most satisfying read.
B00E8JZILA|4.0|Fun game i like a comic book movie . Not hard to play but a great story . I finshed it i dont finsh many games ! Touch controls dont work verry good i switch them off . Play this in the dark with head phones!!!!
1623650003|4.0|An opening tragedy segues into alternating scenarios presented from the viewpoints of the victims, investigators and perpetrators in modern day France. Some of the details are muddled and there are puzzling references to something called \\"articulated trucks\\"-- all of which may be due to a less than colloquial translation. There are some logical flaws as well. Nonetheless, the overall effect is positive, and the interest level is maintained at a very high level of fluency and tension. Therefore, I have no hesitation in recommending this novel to American readers with a special affinity for police procedurals endowed with a strong human interest component.
B008602KQI|4.0|I didn't think I'd relate to this film because I'm no longer a youngster, but I viewed it out of curiosity. I wanted to see what the hype was all about. I was surprised how strongly the love and the survival instincts permeated the storyline, an interesting and compelling play on our most basic drives. It wasn't great in my opinion, but it was quite good. I enjoyed it.

B00B5HQL50|3.0|Plot was wildly unreal and final editing left something to be desired. Nonetheless, the action scenes were well produced. I'm glad I viewed it, but it wasn't as good as earlier &#34;007s.&#34;
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were likable. A difficult subject was handled with humor, but was also a tear jerker. I read it in about three sittings as it was hard to put down.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|As always, John Grissom kept me riveted in the story.  The story line was good and I felt as if I were right there in the middle of it all.  Even though I was angered by some ot the incidents I kept reading.

140006922X|2.0|I am not an expert on religion but do quite a bit of reading of history.  I found the book mildly interesting,but one aspect of it puzzles me greatly.  The author prides himself on historical and religious expertise and of having an unbiased approach to the religious aspect of the life and times of Jesus' and of Palestine in general at the time.  So how, by any stretch does Mr Aslan time and time again refer to the Jewish religion as &#34;the Jewish cult?&#34;  Cult?!  The Temple of Solomon was over 1000 years old (though rebuilt) and the Jewish religion commensurately as old.  Is Mr Aslan showing a bias here, or ignorance.  M. Moskowitz

B0084TWN9K|4.0|I liked the stories and considered giving it five stars. I found, though, that I did not look forward to picking up the book and starting the next one as much I have with other collections. I generally read novels and enjoy being temporarily transported to a world simultaneously different and similar to the one in which I live.
B000S1M9LY|3.0|1079 pages?  Could have achieved his (Wallace's) purpose in much less and still have been impactful.  How?  Start with verbosity.  Although I did admire his extensive vocabulary,  he (Wallace) was long on verbose.  The Foreword says the author didn't want you going to the dictionary every few pages.  Well, I did (go to the dictionary) every few pages only to find many of his (the author's) words missing.  I guess the dictionary needs to consult Wallace for further inclusions.  And pretentious?  The footnoting is pretentious.  If it's that important (the information in the footnotes), include it in the body (of the novel).  Many times it was just to show off knowledge (Wallace's) of drug compounds or cinematic equipment.  Was it (the knowledge) correct?  Who cares-does it matter?  I felt the style (of the novel) did bear a resemblance (philosophically speaking) with stream of consciousness writings and the variations of grammatical structure that occurred around the beginning of the last century.<br /><br />Half way through I wanted to quit.  That would put the author (Wallace) on par (in my opinion) with James Joyce, whose &#34;Ulysses&#34; I didn't finish (and the only novel I never finished) because I finally just didn't care what was going through people's minds (in &#34;Ulysses&#34;).  For Wallace's novel, I felt he was gratuitously violent & voyeuristically prurient in his (Wallace's) deviant & nauseating detail.  Halfway (through the novel) when I was ready to quit, I even allowed the idea (in my head) of skipping to the end to double check that my version of what I thought the ending would be was the version Wallace chose.  Ha! Ha! Ha! There was no ending (to the story lines).  (And no, I didn't skip to the end to find that out.  I read all 1079 pages!)  Although the novel was overall entertaining (at times humorous, depressing, & illuminating), the major disappointment (for me) was that he didn't finish the stories.  He (Wallace) left you hanging (not literally).  Is that what the author means by he (the author) wants to entertain you?  Or is it just the infinite jest?<br />Please note the lack of footnoting.  My apologies to anyone who enjoyed that element of the novel.

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I’ve been a Star Trek fan for longer than I can remember. I was only two years old when the original series was cancelled, but I watched it early on in the syndication – around the same time I watched the Animated Series. I’ve seen all the movies on or shortly after opening day. After seeing the pilot of The Next Generation, I didn’t bother watching it again until the Third Season – by which time it was a much better series, and I’ve watched the subsequent series, but not with the dedication I had for the original.<br /><br />Of course, an adult looks for different things in entertainment than a child – at least I hope that’s the case. When I watched Trek initially, it was for the “neat-o” things: phasers, photon torpedoes, the ship being thrown off axis and crewmembers flying everywhere. Later, I watched for the familiar interactions of the crew. Even later, I picked up on the social/political commentary embedded in many episodes. Not long ago, I was watching an episode called “A Private Little War” which concerned the Klingons and Federation arming different factions on a neutral planet, and I realized the episode was an allegory about Vietnam.<br /><br />Many of these thoughts returned to me after watching the latest Trek film: Into Darkness. It’s certainly entertaining, in that it holds the viewer’s attention. Like most genre films these days, it’s paced relentlessly fast. I saw the movie twice, mostly because it was in 3-D, a first for a Star Trek film. But it was a curiously empty experience.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />First, there is the issue of the villain, who’s revealed to be none other than Khan Noonian Singh. Let’s ignore the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch, while a fine actor, is totally unsuited to the role of a North Indian superman. Let’s focus on how the character is written. Khan as portrayed in STID is a psychotic killer without remorse or redemptive qualities, who committed genocide during the 20th Century. This is poles apart from the way Khan was written in the original series, where he was described as “the best of the tyrants…there were no massacres under his rule.” The writing, and Ricardo Montalban’s performance, exuded a sense of ruthless nobility. During the course of the episode, Khan killed precisely ZERO crewmembers. It was for this reason that Kirk dropped charges against Khan and his followers and settled them on a planet – which subsequently suffered an ecological disaster. Even the revenge obsessed, Ahab-Like Khan of the second Star Trek film, who rightly blamed Kirk for neglecting to send follow up ships to check on their progress, was restrained enough to maroon the crew of the Reliant on Ceti Alpha V rather than killing them – although he killed several people later in the film. The original Khan and the alternate Khan are not the same villain, and the alternate timeline of the new movies is not an adequate excuse for that.  Further, what makes villains, from Montalban’s Khan to Hopkins’ Lecter, interesting are when they can persuade the audience to understand their point of view – even if they are repelled by the character.<br /><br />Secondly, there is the film’s portrayal of Kirk as a reckless youth, too big for his britches and not worthy of commanding a starship. By the end of the film, he’s had his comeuppance. Whether he’s matured into the character seen in the original series remains to be seen.<br /><br />To be blunt, I find the portrayal of Kirk in the two most recent Trek films to be offensive. Although the new films’ kirk grew up in an altered universe from the original series, it’s worth remembering that originally the young Kirk was remembered as “a stack of books with legs” by associates who knew him while in Starfleet Academy.<br /><br />The impression most people have of the original series' Kirk as a shoot first, talk later, bed down with every space-babe Captain is exaggerated. In reality, hewas a lot closer to Pike and Picard than he is to the Kirk character in the two most recent movies. Also, William Shatner’s acting style has been so often and broadly parodied that it has changed the perceptions of casual and non-fans regarding his real portrayal. It’s worth remembering that Shatner’s performance in early TOS episodes was initially criticized as “wooden” by TV Guide. Shatner did his share of scenery chewing, but those were rare and mostly toward the end of the series’ run and in the movies.<br /><br />Take for example, Kirk’s alleged aggression. There are plenty of episodes where Kirk resisted the impulse/advice to act more aggressively against a real or perceived enemy (Where No Man has Gone Before, The Devil in the Dark, The Corbomite Maneuver, The Conscience of the King, Arena, By Any Other Name, The Omega Glory). In nearly every episode in which there’s aggression, Kirk is backed into a corner until there’s no alternative (Where No Man has Gone Before), or undertakes it to stave off an expansion of hostilities (Balance of Terror).<br /><br />Then there is the issue of Kirk’s alleged promiscuity. He certainly had his share of “action”, but there were often qualifiers: under a spell/hypnosis/posession (Elaan of Troyus, Dagger of the Mind, Return to Tomorrow); amnesia (The Paradise Syndrome); divided in two by the transporter (The Enemy Within); the female was an android/simulacrum (What Are Little Girls Made of, Requiem for Methuselah, Shore Leave); operating under false pretenses (The Conscience of the King, Mirror Mirror, Catspaw, By Any Other Name, Wink of an Eye, The Mark of Gideon). He also had his share of exes – intelligent, independent females – most of whom regarded him highly, and vice-versa (Court Martial, The Deadly Years, The Wrath of Khan). There was one exception, Janet Lester, who was arguably psychotic. Kirk also suffered his share of romantic tragedy (The City on the Edge of Forever, The Paradise Syndrome), and was even given the brush-off (The Voyage Home). Finally, anyone who followed the series even casually could discern that many of these flings didn’t go “all the way”. Somehow, I can’t imagine the series’ Kirk bedding down with two alien females while the Beastie Boys blasted from his sound system.<br /><br />Ultimately, of course, it's the writer who's responsible for the character's arc. Classic Trek was blessed with a great writer D. C. (Dorothy) Fontana, one of the few female writers in television in those days. She and the rest of the creative team - including the actors - made Kirk and Spock into complex, interesting, and imperfect characters. The J. J. Abrams franchise is run by post-adolescent fanboys who place cleverness and contrivance before substance – STID’s final act, which is a twist on TWOK, rings especially hollow.  Not that the new Trek isn't entertaining - but it's not a character driven drama – and it doesn’t stand up to repeated viewing.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I hate the upgrades there so much money and gold.My brother Hunter love's this game.I have to kill balck pather.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />Perhaps I'm showing my age. First, the new [[ASIN:B00AZMFK3K Star Trek Into Darkness (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)]] movie largely left me cold. Now, the new Superman movie, Man of Steel, has been released to great fanfare. I dutifully saw it on opening weekend and was largely unimpressed.<br /><br />What I liked: Henry Cavill does an excellent job portraying Kal-El, giving a slightly more brooding turn than usual. Some purists will object to a Briton portraying America's superhero, but as Superman is not even human, I'm fine with it. As for Clark Kent, we see very little of him - the famous glasses are not even worn until the last few frames of the movie. Amy Adams brings a knowing glint to Lois Lane, sadly missing from Kate Bosworth's limp portrayal in Superman Returns. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent in every respect, particularly Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent.  The non-linear plot construction was a nice touch, and a creative way to tell Superman's back story - which everyone should know by now.<br /><br />What I disliked: I didn't like the reimagined Krypton - give me the Donner icy galactic version any day. Nor did I care for the dumbed down plot and solution. In previous incarnations, from the comic books, to the serials, the classic 50s TV show and Christopher Reeve movies, Superman was always victorious in the end because he used his most important superpower: his brain. Here, we just have a series of endless action sequences ending in a snapped neck. The tuneless, percussive score droned monotonously. There's quite a bit of product placement in Man of Steel - but there was in the 1978 Superman movie as well. Cheerios and Timex watches have been replaced with IHOP and Sears.<br /><br />Best for a rental, this will not hold up to repeat viewing.

Prepare to be swept off your feet!
006202406X|1.0|I have to start off with saying, I adored the first and second book. I fell in love with Tris and Four, and felt like I was going through this journey along side them. That being said (spoilers ahead) the way she left off the second book, I was so excited to start this new phase of their journey. When they finally found the real reason to be sent outside, I must say Ms. Roth not only did you mislead Tris and Four on where their journey would be heading, you misled the reader. I think she backed herself into a \\"writing corner\\" ,if you will, and set her bar too high. The story came to screeching halt when they arrived at the bureau. And it seemed like me that she killed of Tris just to have a climax to the book.<br /><br />After reading the book I googled it and saw that I was not alone in my feeling and saw that Ms. Roth that she did not write it for her fans. Good, because she lost me as one.<br /><br />Now knowing the ending of the trilogy, I really wish I never took the time, money, or energy to read the first two. And I hope this review keeps at least one person from having their hopes raised as high as mine.<br /><br />Don't buy. Don't waste the time.

B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I love this game and will be happy to give five stars once I am able to update it. It tells me an update is needed to continue playing and when I try to update on Amazon it tells me I already own the game, nothing about an update! Please fix so I can keep playing! I just bought a cash bundle from the store :( I would hate for it to be a huge waste! I will give 5 stars when the problem is resolved...
B001NHNG64|5.0|Fast action packed satisfying I look forward to the next book in the Reacher series. I liked that main character didn't have a bunch of issues, but was competent, intelligent and fearless
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Better than the last one very good graphics and I think I will be playing this game a lot until beat this game
B00B2GK4KW|4.0|It is very good tool, look as advertised, and works smoothly and of high quality but not so easy to use because need to wiggle it around to punch through
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I see that other individuals have no problem installing on Kindle Fire HD 7...but for me it downloads than usually fails. Only in one instance did it not but than it just sat in the installation state for more than 8 hours as I let it run overnight. Giving it one last try after freeing up more space...but if it still fails the rating will remain at 1 star.<br /><br />Update: managed to get it to<br /> install but it required me to back up and reset my Kindle to factory defaults just to get it to work.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|After seeing a few movie ads, I really didn't know what this book was about, but knew if I decided to see the movie I'd have to read the book first.<br /><br />Now a few pages in, I was quite surprised and confused by the story and narration. At first, I considered quitting and wasn't thrilled with the tone, but persevered. I'm glad I did, it's a great story!<br /><br />It is touching, sad, but also satisfying to the soul.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This game is really good. It is not difficult to play but is fun &amp; fast paced.  Just an overall fun game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product and affordable.  It was easy to install and my son can now enjoy the tablet movies even more.  You can stream it all.  Pictures...video....do not hesitate to buy...well worth it.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is very cute children like  7 &amp; up can play this game . It's fun easy . Helps passes time only thing that should change is the $2.00  for 40 crowns I did purchase it once but then it was not there anymore. I believe It should always be there , for people that only have a set limit of money to spend online. But I still love the game defiantly try it
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Great cd. This man has a way with songs. Great guitar too. Call Me The Breeze is a great cover. All songs are great. You can not go wrong here.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game no this.real life feeling is cool.and you can control the robot don't know if it's like controlling in the movie but it's awesome so what are you waiting for play!!!!!!
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Cornwall continues to surprised me, but I wish they had wrapped up all the deaths committed by this guy. And more info on the killer. We learn about him late in the novel and then don't learn much. But I think the book was well written and kept me enthralled to the end. .
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Would have given five stars but I am not on Facebook and because of that I have<br />to pay to use the seaport on the game. Not every one is on Facebook zynga!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg Allman solo. He is great. This cd has some great songs. Gregg is at his best here. Roots music done by Gregg Allman......enough said.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. Some the most amazing people from around the world play this game. I'm a BingoBlitzaholic. I have more Bingo friends than I even know real people and they are some of the realest I know. Highly recommend.
0143120255|5.0|Such a perfect conversation starter. This books is a great add to my coffee table book collection. I first saw this in a bookstore in Paris but was very expensive but Amazon offered such an amazing price that I HAD to get it.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Amazing collection of Team Ico games in HD, a lot of extras too, two of the best PS2 games in glorious HD, i highly recommend this game !!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's been a long time since I enjoyed a book as much as this one. Well worth the reading time.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Enjoyable game with lead-up experiences. I am going to really enjoy beating each design as they get harder and harder.<br />I<br />Enjoyable experience
B0017APPSE|4.0|Very good movie, the story are great and the cast is amazing too, i higly recommend watch this movie !!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I LOVED this game!!! figuring out how to unlock each piece to get into another and how something made another thing work. brilliant work fireproof games!! I cant wait for the next one to come out!!!
B007TK77QE|5.0|Although The Casual Vacancy is a view of life through a jaundiced eye, it's brilliantly written and the characters are sharp and  the story, while confronting, is beautifully unfolded.  I haven't read any of the Harry Potter series and I imagine people who pick up 'The Casual Vacancy' thinking it might belong in the same genre  might be quite shocked as this is adult fiction, raw, gritty and in your face.  Can't wait to read more of her adult fiction.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this controller to play Fifa with my brother, this is a great controller from Sony, i like the Dualshok since the first one !!!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|As a logical woman, I can't like this book.  The science is sloppy, the characters are not nearly as enjoyable as they once were, and the whole book is a horrible letdown.  It is another recent book that really lowers examples of strong young women in YA literature.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a neat, almost mindless little game that lets you basically have your own little nook in the game world, and do a bit of waiting for things to finish. It's a peaceful, pretty game. I like it.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Amazing collection, all the Metal Gear games too date, the Artbook is Amazing too, i recommend this collection to all MG fans !!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very well written, I was on the edge of my seat. The ending was satisfying, though I hoped for more, I was satisfied.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This game is simply unplayable on the original kindle fire. You can only touch with two fingers o. the screen whereas some minigames require a 3 touch screen. aloe you have to blow into a microphone for some which the kindle fire does not have.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|Amazing movie, Christopher Nolan is a genius, the best Batman movie ever, i recommend thie for every Batman fan !!!
B0000VD04M|3.0|After 3 tries, I can't come up with a clear answer.  It was just a bit too odd for me.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|My favorite seen is when they are sharing scars and stories about there past, and of course when Richard Dryfuss comes up from the depths of the ocean to surprise Roy Scheider who thinks he is the sole survivor.  Another Great Shark Movie Deep Blue with LL Cool J.
B008645YEE|5.0|Great Soundtrack, all the songs are great, the composer Hans Zimmer is the best, i recommend this soundtrack to everyone !!!
B007BGQFTQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series and would love to read more about the next phase of their lives...which is why I rate it 4 stars instead of five. I felt the ending was rushed and left me wondering how things really end.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Cut back on the DRAMA already, more action less whaaaaaaaa...There zombies! More survival more action more characters.  Less Cry Babies
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A book you cannot put down .  It keeps your interest and encourages you to keep reading to see if you have made the right conclusion.
B005R32L66|1.0|Can't seem to update Skype on my android whereas I previously had Skype.  What is going on?  Anybody have an idea?
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This is an exciting movie.  The beginning was a slow start but after the Super Heroes come together; Iron Man, The Hulk....its on!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game has good graphics and achievable goals unlike some games I've tried. Would recommend this one as one of the best of it's kind.very addicting
B003XVYLDU|1.0|Plus 4 stars! I have to encourage you to read Slaughterhouse-5. It is one of the most important books of the 20th century.<br /><br />Please do not pay any attention to the other 1* reviews. Those people are unlikely to distinguish between the shopping channel and a documentary about consumerism.<br /><br />This is a work of serious literature, steeped in irony, a poignant, and often humorous reflection on issues that affect individuals, families and society, e.g. love, friendship, enmity, luck, success, war, loss, marriage, manhood, old age, dementia.<br /><br />Please read this book, more than once.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't have asked for a better series to have put on my Kindle! I never wanted it to end. Thank you very much.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Yeah - a bit over the top, but the final (concluding) episode is frankly amazing.  ALL LOOSE ENDS (and I do mean ALL) are tied up VERY nicely.  Better than I've ever seen a show conclude before.  And it was lots of fun getting to that point, too!  Yes -- it has some disgusting moments, but some of it is fun as well.  It's HORROR, folks!  Pull your pants up and act like an adult if you want to watch real horror!  It's not psycho-slash or anything, but it is disturbing at times.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|In my opinion this is by far the best ST movie yet! Even though I am a big fan of the original and subsequent spin offs I can't help but enjoy the new direction hey have taken. Without  giving anything away the story was not exactly what I thought it would be... talk about surprised!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Anything by Nicholas Sparks has NEVER been a disappointment to me. I look forward to reading it in the very near future. Will probably end up buying the book itself as I have all his others as well in paperback.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. Howey does a great job developing the characters. Not a stay up all night to finish the book story but a savor the pages and think about the implications story. Looking forward to reading more.
B00F880BWG|5.0|good episode, great start for hopefully another good season. Recommend it for anyone who hasnt started the season yet. .
0525478817|5.0|SPOILER ALERT **<br />The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is truly an amazing book. It tells the tragic love story of two teens that have cancer. The young couple takes a trip to Amsterdam, courtesy of the genie company, which grants one wish to a cancer fighter.  During their journey, they seek the writer of their favorite book, An Imperial Affliction. After their trip, the male in the relationship finds out that his cancer is back, and later he passes away. Little did his family know that he had spent his last few weeks writing a sequel to An Imperial Affliction, for his girlfriend, Emily. I recommend this book because it grabs you from the start and hits you in the heart.<br />Claire T.
0800141660|5.0|This is my FAVORITE Austen movie, and maybe the only time in my life that I'll say the movie is better than the book!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This was a good Neil Gain story that is very imaginative. It is not as good as I expect one of his books to be but it was a fun quick read.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I LOVE THE WHOLE GAME AS AN FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS. ALL OF MY FRIENDS SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME. CAUSE IT IS FUN.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|I must be honest.. After watching this movie I felt bad for not watching it on the big screen! Simply put this movie is filled with action packed awesomeness!! If you're a sci-fi buff or anime buff or even a rpg buff you'll love this movie even more! Don't want to spoil the movie for anyone so I won't go into details but from beginning to end this movie had me in the edge of my seat! I'm not one to buy hard copies of movies because I don't like rewatching them since I already know what's going to happen. Lets just say I'll be ordering a blueray copy. Plus I want to help support movies like this! Oh forgot to mention if you like any of the mech assault games or even have interest in the upcoming titanfall game you'll love this movie!!! But also if you like no bs action packed movies. ;)
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I love the game but I'm loaded becuz I was suppose to receive free coins and I didn't and I don't want to spend real money I just want to play the game
B007SGM084|5.0|This book is absolutely the BEST love story I've ever read. Yes, there's strong sex scenes and curse words but the story behind that makes it a page turner. I've read it 3 times...all 3 books and it never gets old!!!!
1591396190|4.0|Interesting and well written.  Not sure that this is a check-list for addressing the blue ocean, [look for underserved markets, as did Cirque du Soleil], but it is a well written book which helps a leader of a company address the fundamental question.<br /><br />&#34;Am I addressing my true market... rather than focusing on a margin killing narrowly defined market.&#34;<br /><br />Most management strategy books are dry.  This book is very well written, even though some of the interpretation of the  in it is inconclusive.  But that is sort of the point.  Need to focus on big picture of where market for your products and services are and not entirely on strictly on narrow statistically significant postulates.
B00EV6T6DQ|4.0|Hats off to Ms. Maroh.  Such a big project, and from the bio at the end of the book, she has done so much on her own. Brava.<br /><br />There are moments within where she skillfully reveals a lot with only a few words or drawings.<br /><br />I fear the story telling gets a but heavy handed at the end; from the plot devices to the moralizing. I would have enjoyed, too, seeing more of the explanation of the fracas with Clem's family.<br /><br />This book and the movie have their own story to tell about development, how a book can be the germ that is only and rarely fully developed in the film.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|fun and frustrating. makes you think. like the graphics took awhile to figure out the jelly. glad it is free.  I do not paying
B00BPDR3F6|4.0|Elizabeth Gilbert has managed to incorporate many stories into one.  Her writing is clear and enjoyable.  I loved the story, a very different view of the late 1700's and early to mid 1800's than any story I have ever read.  It did get a slight bit tedious at times when she talked about scientific bits but all in all a very enjoyable read.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is great!  I found it to be very informative and helpful with my understanding of gluten.  Everyone should read it.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|I enjoyed this ( my first book by this author ). I especially enjoy books that successfully employ multiple characters points of view.  I would have given it 5 stars but I found myself skimming through some areas.  Too much repetition and politics.  Over all though it was an excellent book and I will try more from this writer.
B005K17RU0|5.0|there are very few apps that I get that are truly useful but this app is &quot;the bomb&quot;.  It gives you all of the weather information you need. It is the first app I use EVERY DAY.  I can't believe it's free.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game makes my Kindle crash and not want to work.  It took forever to download it and then I had to remove it shortly after. =(
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Riveting story. Great descriptive imagery. Tolerable ending to a warring tale. Probably this book would be more appropriate for teenagers.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|My thought after finishing Allegiant was: &#34;Whoa--what on earth was that??&#34; From the reviews here, seems like many others had that same reaction.<br /><br />I felt such strong disappointment that I decided to post my first book review ever on Amazon.<br /><br />It's been three days since I've finished, and in that time I've weighed giving the book 2 stars or 1 star. In the end, I decided on the latter--there's so much wrong here, and so little that really works.<br /><br />I'll get to specific, spoiler-filled reasons in a moment. But first, the non-spoiler thoughts: Much of the book is dull and talky. Characterization is much poorer than the previous books--lots of two-dimensional characters, and inconsistent divergence (ha) from what we've known of the characters in the previous books (chiefly Tobias). Many plot points and themes are inconsistent as well, and the ending is unsatisfying not so much because of *what* happens or *why*, but rather *how* it happens.<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />Many reviewers, here and elsewhere, have elaborated on the book's weaknesses. I'd like to add three observations to the mix; I'm sure someone somewhere has already noted these, but I haven't seen them emphasized in other reviews. So maybe it's just me, but these three things bothered me greatly:<br /><br />1) THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE FENCE IS DULL AND UNDERDEVELOPED: Insurgent left this as the chief story question: What is the world outside the fence? Allegiant offers a thin answer that doesn't bear scrutiny. What's up with the Fringe? We spend a lot of time on it, two long chapters--we discover people there are poor. And it's violent. OK... so? Why is it that way? If it's anything like real-world poverty, I assume there's a variety of contributing factors. But the book suggests, somewhat vaguely, that government oppression of GDs is the sole cause. OK... well, how about that government then? The United States still exists apparently, but what does the current government look like? They seem pretty weak in their oversight of the Bureau, but are strong enough to keep many folks in abject poverty? And what exactly is the relationship between the government and the Bureau--surely the Bureau doesn't act entirely on its own? Wouldn't the government possess significant concern about a memory reset of the entire Bureau by a bunch of rebels from the experiment? It's utterly unclear how the government and broader society operates here--thus, the chief story question left by Insurgent remains, in my view, unanswered.<br /><br />2) THE BOOK FEELS LIKE A RETCON: OK, I get that it's the nature of a story like this to discover that things we thought we knew just aren't true. You can do that a bit and not only get away with it, but add significantly to the plot. From Insurgent, I'd put Evelyn's non-death in that category. But in Allegiant, Roth backtracks so much that it gave me mental whiplash. Who is Edith Prior? Never mind, her identity doesn't matter really. Sending an army of Divergent outside the city? Nope, that was a lie told for reasons that aren't entirely clear. Tori's brother dead? No he's not, but that fact contributes next to nothing to the plot. The faction/factionless conflict in the series really matters right? Doesn't appear so--it gets little time and is (unbelievably) easily resolved. Tris's mom was from Dauntless? Oops, no--and somehow Jeanine knew that, but don't ask how. The Erudite developed the attack serum? Sorry, they were just toadies dependent on the Bureau. Being Divergent involves serum resistance? Well kinda but not really. So is Tobias Divergent? Well, actually not, but don't expect an explanation for how Tris actually is beyond the word &#34;genetics.&#34; Perhaps Roth planned these things from the beginning. If so, she executes these revelations ineffectively; if not, well, this smells like the retcon it is.<br /><br />3) HOW TRIS DIED: Now let me be utterly clear: I'M NOT BOTHERED BY THE *FACT* THAT TRIS DIED. Her death could've possessed tragic, artful beauty. I also get the sacrificial theme Roth was going for in her death (i.e., *why* she died). My problem is that *how* she died is inconsistent with the *why*.<br /><br />If you read Roth's blog post on why Tris died, you'll find that she intended her death to demonstrate Tris's understanding of love and sacrifice. Thematically, I can accept that. The problem is, the actual reasons--the &#34;how&#34;--of Tris's death possess inconsistencies with that theme.<br /><br />So why did Tris die? From this reader's point of view, the following reasons, chiefly:<br /><br />1) TRIS HAD A MOMENT OF STUPIDITY. Really--leaving her gun behind when going into the serum room? I could see Caleb doing that. But not someone Dauntless-trained.<br /><br />2) HER ENEMIES WERE STUPIDER. So they found evidence an attack might occur. Now, what would you do in that situation, if you were David? I'd get those planes in the air, right away, or at least protect the pilots. I'd get some key decision-makers to safe, secure locations. I mean, I'd be more familiar with these serums that anyone else; I'd have safeguards in place to deal with death and memory serums getting loose in the compound. This is obvious--at least it should be obvious to people as supposedly smart as the Bureau. (Tangent: The Bureau seem like Erudite 2.0. Wish Roth had written a different kind of villain here--makes me wonder what bad experiences she had with science profs at Northwestern...) Or, at least station some more guards at the all-important serum room. Or inside it. I mean, they had just this kind of attack earlier in the book--that should've been a big wake-up call about their lax security measures. In short, the bad guys here are much too stupid to be credible enemies, especially given all the scientific prowess they're supposed to possess.<br /><br />3) TRIS WAS SELFISH. Now this strikes directly against Roth's chief theme. Consider it. Why did Tris want to destroy the Bureau? Because the Bureau is a GP-dominated entity with a history of oppressing GDs. The Bureau was concerned about violent leaders in the city and wanted to erase their memories--never mind the collateral damage to the many innocent people in the city.<br /><br />But, what about the city? Well, the city is a GD-dominated entity (the factions) with a history oppressing GPs (Divergents, and especially Factionless Divergents). On behalf of the city, Tris is concerned about violent leaders in the Bureau, and wants to erase their memories--never mind the collateral damage to the many innocent people in the Bureau (those poor GD underlings we see through Nita...)<br /><br />And the thing is, this isn't just my read of the narrative. Tris acknowledges this herself in a critical conversation in Chapter 39: &#34;It's not a perfect situation. But when you have to choose between two bad options, you pick the one that saves the people you love and believe in most. You just do. Okay?&#34; So on one hand, Roth wants us to believe that the entire trilogy is about true self-sacrifice. On the other hand, she offers self-oriented relational interest as the chief, overriding criterion for making tough ethical decisions.<br /><br />I think I just heard several dead Abnegation spinning in their graves...<br /><br />So in the end, I found Allegiant to be a dull, slow, incoherent mess of a book. Some have taken this as an opportunity to bash Roth. I don't think that's warranted. We all make mistakes--and Roth is still a young (albeit very successful) author. And we know from Divergent and Insurgent that she can write an awesome book. She also seems like an author who possesses significant respect for her readers. My hope--and it's a longshot, I know--but my hope is that her respect will translate into an apology. I think her fans still care about her--I think they'd take well to an, &#34;I'm sorry, I really tried, but I goofed&#34; sort of acknowledgment. (If only George Lucas had done that after Star Wars Episode I...) Then I'd welcome a fix--maybe a rewrite of the ending, if not the entire book. Until then, I'll just pretend I have some memory serum to push Allegiant aside--and I'll try to imagine an ending that's truer to the story's themes and roots.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy setup, great picture quality, and it's really convenient to use your phone as remote.  For me, this is taking place of using a gaming console and buying a yearly subscription to stream movies.
B00003CXCD|5.0|A real classic.  A feel good movie if you like vintage films and actors from a bygone era.<br />Audrey Hepburn is always delightful!  Nice to see Rome, Italy in the past....
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Another Zombie Apocalypse movie.  But, I did like how they portrayed the zombies in this movie.  They were quick moving, and had this weird &#34;twitch&#34; to them.  A bit scarier than the lumbering zombies on Walking Dead. Brad Pitt did a good job. Overall, a good movie that my 13 year old and I enjoyed. I would recommend it if you like fast paced action movies.
0744014956|2.0|Not necessary at all, doesn't include any information on online mode.  The pictures are nice and the maps are somewhat useful for some of the less intuitive missions.  Ultimately not required or especially helpful for anything.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Great game. Love to look for the items. This game is very challenging and would recommend to anyone who likes hidden object games and likes a good challenge.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Granddaughter enjoys the game,and the graphics are fantastic enjoy looking at the scenery while she plays. Too many coins need to get the girl character though.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Although this book can't magically solve all the problems in the world, the eye opening theory and further understanding of the love languages and the way they can be used in all parts of my youthful single life were truly helpful. I began with a basic understanding of the theory but the thorough examples and heavy hitting quotes make me glad that I own this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked the book very much and thought it was a nice sequel to the first one! The end was very surprising in a good way
B000WC39ZE|4.0|This is one of my favorite Dick Van Dyke movies.  I have always liked watching this when I was a kid, and still do.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|The twists and turns are fast - the development of  the characters on all levels are are adding to the layers of the story  - cant get enough - wish it doesnt have an end - unfortunately it does
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I saw RUSH in Phoenix AZ during the Time Machine tour, and it was likely the best RUSH show I've ever seen (and I have seen RUSH in concert 15 times, since 1980).  The DVDs capture every moment of the live performance, with great cinematography and sound.  Add this one to your DVD collection!
B00CO6QGCE|3.0|Okay, so, I love music, and I lived this app it was so cool! The only problem was that it would NEVER SHUT DOWN. I'd charge my Kindle Fire overnight and I turn it on, it's 48 percent already!! I deleted it after a day and a half. Three stars because it was fun, it worked right, but it sucks your battery life GONE. I really hate that.... But I love the app. So ugh. But I'd recommend it if they fixed this PLEASE!
B004XANKVO|5.0|I love this backpack!  I use it for work everday, as well as personal travel use.  Several compartments and pockets to keep everything organized and protected.  I would highly recomment this product.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|very thoughtful and a wobderful review of the research and literature...Makes one think carefully about one's health and how o take care of it.
0321525655|4.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take their presentation skills to the next level. This book will force you to think outside of the box. This book is not meant to discourage you but instead encourage you to tap in to your inner most creativity. Everyone should want to make their presentations more effective, more creative and more impactful. At the end of the day, it's all about connecting with your audience. Read Presentation Zen to open your mind to new ideas.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good read, fun and EZ to enjoy this book. I completed this book in too days and thought it was worth it
B004MKLRYC|4.0|I read it, and giggled. Then I sent it to my mother, who works in a library (so appropriate). Not much to it, but liked the orinality of the thought.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the game is so much fun.I love the way you guys put the game together where you have different places to go to or levels to go to.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A good read, fun and EZ to enjoy this book. I completed this book in too days and thought it was worth it
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|Horrible movie not worth the rental. I would not recoomend.  A movie that clearly weighed it potential on the cast which it did not deliver an excellent story but not put together.  Computer graphics was horrible and needs a new look
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|Great product for a mid range PC. I used this in my first PC Gaming Setup, and so far it is working very well! Since there is a newer version out (the 4570k) this one is a little cheaper to pick up, and functions almost as well! Definitely worth the value!!!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|Boring and not Fitting product for the price.  I would recommend something better in sci-fi than this. Enjoy if you have already rented.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I love this for my mid level PC. It never heats up at all, and it is surprisingly quiet. It was a little tricky to install, however, this was my first home built PC so it might have just been because i am a rookie
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I got eleven words for you... this game is so freaking addicting that it's not even funny. I love this game. I just downloaded it last night and in already on level 17. Candy Crush Saga+Epic= A happy Skinny Mike YO GO CARDS and GO ARKANSAS
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Wants me to update to continue use but no update is offered so what to do getting ready to delete since takes so much space and can't play now ...
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Stephen King's part autobiography / part writing guide is written in a straight forward, frank and sometimes humorous manner, keeping me interested from beginning to end. This never for one minute got tedious, like many writing guides tend to, and I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of King's fiction; someone interested in polishing their own craft of writing, or both.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I absolutely love John Grisham's books.  I dislike having to finish them because then I have to wait such a long time for another book to come along.  Sycamore Row has so many twists and turns with various people and events, absolutely could not put it down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|totally worth playing. this game actually requires skill, but there is certainly enough luck involved to carry the gameplay thru to the next level after enough tries. just remember that when you first start the game and win free things to use, you have to turn them off or you will use them up during the easy beginning levels...
0070511136|5.0|Having read a few books on sales recently in anticipation of starting a career in selling financial services, I loved reading this because it was a book that was not just stated in opinions, but was rather backed up by solid research and statistics. Selling is something that I have been looking up quite a bit lately and I must say the writer did a great job selling me on his research of what really sells in big $ sales. What I really love is he doesn't just say &#34;hey this stuff is god and I'm right on everything,&#34; but rather does a great job at leaving things open and does a swell job of answering the exact questions that seemed to arise in my head as I read this book attempting to rebut the info provided to me. I cant say that this book alone will make you be extremely successful casue I cant say from expereince, but i can only imagine that THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK if your starting out a career or a season vet who might be slumping in performance
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so psyched that you finally made candy crush saga available on kindle! I waited a long time! A million thanks to you! Fun and addictive game!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The twists and turn were unforeseen & lovely!  Author made you feel a part of this family and community.  First time reading a book by an author from Australia, which had me thinking &#34;Easter in Autumn?&#34;  I loved it and will read more of her books!
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|I really loved this toy, but there's no articulation. Be careful to not drop it on the floor because it's not made of plastic and it seems a little bit fragile. It comes with a bag of money and a bag of meth. I'm a big fan of Breaking Bad, so I think Heisenberg toy is awesome!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is a moving, disturbing book. I live in America, and lived very well, during this period of Afghanistan's history. I find myself cringing and crying, unable to put down this book. A call to arms world wide is in order. So hard to believe such suppression is even possible. A gripping read from start to finish. All privileged people need to sit down with this gripping dose of reality.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard but some good challenges. The graphics are better than many escape games. I recommend this as a pleasurable time.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|A great way to pass the time and an amazing story. It has everything from mystery to demons to romance.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I don't want to write too much about this book since I don't want to expose &#34;the secret&#34;.  Suffice  to say that I have recommended this book to many of my friends.  I did guess the secret about 3/4 of the way through but it did not matter since I was so engaged in the characters.  Great for book clubs
B00E72OKAS|1.0|I truly love this game had it for 5 minutes I got so addictive if u like this app try hill climb I just love those two apps I mean not much apps out there that<br />R so fun! . :)
B008JFUNNM|4.0|This movie is amazing! It is really cool and has a ton of action and is based on a true story. I wish I had this movie so I could watch it again!<br /><br />This movie is based on the true story about a guy named Richard Phillips who is a captain of a ship. Pirates come and take the captain as hostage. Eventually he is stuck on a life boat with the pirates and the captain just wants to see his family again. Luckily the navy comes but they don’t want to hurt Captain Phillips so they try to trick the pirates. The movie is very intense and I was on edge the whole time.<br /><br />The main characters in the movie are Captain Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), Muse (Barkhad Abdi), Bilal (BArkhad Abdirahman), Najee (Faysal Ahmen), and Elmi Mahat M. Ali). My favorite character in this movie is Captain Phillips because he is really nice and he would rather sacrifice his own life for his crew. That shows how much he cares about other people. It really made me think about what I would do in this type of situation.<br /><br />My favorite part in the movie is when they capture the captain because that’s when the action really starts. It’s not good that he gets captured but you see a lot of action after that. You see the navy show up, you hear threats from the pirates, you see helicopters in the air. Everything goes crazy! But that’s what I love about these kinds of movies.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for ages 12 and up because this movie is really scary and has a lot of violence and parts that are bloody. It is rated pg-13 so I wouldn’t recommend it for younger kids.<br /><br />Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Anthony A. For more youth film reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Please, please read the book if you were a fan of the series.<br />It is worth your while. It is not a book of fairytale endings but it is a story of great honor and a wonderful message. I cried for around 30 minutes while finishing the book but I loved every second of it. I loved how real the ending was and how for once I was unable to predict every little thing that happened in the story. If you are a person who are into books for the escape of a happy ending you might try to keep an open mind while reading the final chapters. It is happy with some intense sacrifices. As life itself is true to be...<br />Enjoy!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|This one had some good parts but missed the mark and is my least favorite of his books. He had a good idea for the book but just didn't pull it off.  Not really worth reading.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I am giving only three stars because I am on the second region and it won't let me buy the rifle I need. Uninstalled to restart and try again if does work I will give 5 stars.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|This is a good album on the first listen, a solid album on the second, and a great album by the third. I can only hope it continues to get better.  Its a bit different than previous Acrade Fire albums (some might say more dance-able), but its well worth the purchase.  The sound on vinyl is great and the album art is stunning, and get a free code to download the mp3 version.  Now put on some skinny jeans, grab a pabst, and listen to this album while waxing your mustache.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|Hot Air is a nice logic based puzzle that is designed to increase difficulty as you play. The complexity draws the player in.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|***********SPOILERS***********************************SPOILERS********************SPOILERS********************SPOILERS****<br /><br />***************************Wait, did I say SPOILERS?  Don't read if you don't want to see SPOILERS*****************************<br /><br />***********SPOILERS************************One last chance to turn back*************************SPOILERS***********************<br /><br />This book was so disappointing for so many reasons. I LOVED the first 2 books. LOVED THEM. Couldn't wait for Allegiant to<br />come out. I had to force myself through the first half of it. The POV goes back and forth between Tris and Four/Tobias but<br />they sounded the same. Numerous times I had to look to see who was narrating this chapter.<br />I was hoping there would be some explanation of why Caleb was just going to let his sister be killed but no. No reason, good<br />or bad, as to why he let all that happen.<br />Tobias goes to his mother, Evelyn and just asks her to relinquish her position of power and she does, just like that. She just gave everything she had been working and hoping for up.<br />******************Major Spoiler******************************Last Warning***************************************************<br />I'm used to the author killing characters I like but I don't think Tris needed to die. It would have great if Caleb died for his sister to<br />redeem himself. We already had Peter with no chance of redemption. Caleb's character needed it. Then there's the guy who killed<br />Tris, David. They let him live. What? He just killed Tris and all you're going to do is give him the memory serum? Hell I need it to<br />wipe out the memory of this book and all the disappointment it brought.<br />Then a couple of years go by and we see what they are doing in the future Four/Tobias is a Politian. That so doesn't fit his character<br />all. Well, his character in the first 2 books where he was cool and a badass. He is neither cool or a badass in this book. His character<br />is so different and not in a good way. In a wuss way. That alone made me want to cry. Ugh. For everyone who loved him so much in<br />Divergent and Insurgent you will be so sad to see what has been done to him in Allegiant.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Could have been an epic film had corners not been cut, potential was there but it failed to deliver, the trailers pretty much gave the best of what the movie had to offer.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It was like reading divergent all over again. Before was ...divergent and everybody else and now is genetically pure an everybody else. It felt like there was nothing new.
B00902AKK4|3.0|It was free. good map and puzzle game.  it was not bad but it was hard to keep intrest after about 10 levels.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I would recommend this show for people of all ages.  Everyone in my family loves it and we really enjoy getting together to discuss it.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Solid strong light.  The thing I want people to know about the most is that it says 60 watt but its closer to a true 75 watt.  its great you get more than what is needed but I could not put this in my dining room due to the brightness.  But I placed them in the kitchen and I see more now than what I have ever before.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|The story had the past blended into the new story very nicely. I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the series.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|Simple cut the cord game lock the spider out.  it got boring and really hard on some of the medium levels.  I just didnt care for it all that much
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I was a bit worried about reading this so soon after The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared, I thought it would be too similar. I found Harold to be a more likable character, and I could connect with his feeling of wanting to be a part of something bigger than himself. I think most of us like to think we have the power to change or stop the inevitable bad events in our life, and Harold's pilgrimage connects to that feeling. It wasn't a difficult read and I enjoyed it. If reading on an e-reader, I'd recommend checking a map every now and again to see how Harold is progressing. There's a map in the book, but it's at the end.
0399159347|1.0|It was ok. At least I was curious enough to finish it. Somewhat predictable yes. Too bad the characters never find out the real truth to it all. Cecilia was the character I disliked the most and Rachel for some reason I did not feel sorry for her. So it is really hard to like a book where you dont like the main characters and the ones I liked, Polly, John Paul and Mr. Whitby, end up so miserably and sad. Interesting message but somewhat you end up feeling that there was no closure.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|This is a gift for my granddaughter for Christmas. I have done some research on line and this is rated the best. She is bouncy now when you hold her up and she is only 2 months old, she should love it. The package arrive quickly, although the box was shipped in its original factory box and the outside is beat up. Not enough damage to the box that I think the product is damaged, although I have not opened the box yet. Another family member ordered a high chair from Amazon which was also a Fisher Price and that showed up at the door in a separate box, absolutely no damage to the factory box. Over all, very happy with the price and the product.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great , Now i can watch you tube on my t.v. and listen to music . Meets my expectations
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote  is the only app I use to keep lists, ideas and projects organized.  Everything from packing and Christmas lists, to project budgets, and tons more. Five out of five all the way.
B003W16T9K|5.0|Great performances, good sound. Highly recommended. I think this chamber orchestra is just right for this music. I like this packaging. It’s a thin box containing discs in paper sleeves.
B001QOGYFY|4.0|Kate Beckinsale is a very good actress and it's nice to see her in this type of film.  The process of figuring out who did what and why is interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<br />It is the 3rd time I read catching fire. All I can say is that I am addicted.  Yabadabadoo!!!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|Did not like how he left my favorite characters.  Found story line a bit confusing.  Hope to catch up with next book
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Enjoy the saga very much keep up the great work I will continue to enjoy every level with  much anticipation for the next level so I will be trying king games.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|They are too short like i am too tall for these people i am dissa-pointed never atch this movie at all
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This was such a cute movie!!!  I really enjoyed it.  It has the best animation graphics that I've seen in an a long time.  I laughed and I cried.  My boys thought I was a wuss...................lol!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Movie is just as incredible on BluRay as it was in the theater. I love the world of monsters and robots that Del Toro brought to life. I have already watched it 3 times since receiving it, and still love the characters, monsters and robots!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|From the very beginning I was taken back to a &#34;Time To Kill&#34; a story that I couldn't put down then and the same is true with this one with the same great characters. If you are a John Grisham fan then you will love this one.
B000G75AE8|5.0|A Slayer albumn that will slap your teeth out with the attitude of a hungry grizzly bear. You couldn't handle it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The second time I read this book, it was much better than I thought it was.  Reading it the first time I didn't realize how important some people and activities would be.
B0010SEMP0|4.0|Such fun to read!!!  Love the characters and how so quickly you are caught up in the story!  Can not wait to start the next one!
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|tom sawyer cures insomnia! insomnia is a coffe shop but it is also sleep deprivationt is a boring boring boring book.
B00FRQ32N4|4.0|I love the movie now i love the game the game has good graphics and a fun and quick games
B00F91H15W|1.0|This movie is HORRIBLE. It's a total waste of time and should be 0 stars. The premise is absurd: as if all of these super wealthy people haven't bothered to install alarm systems, and don't have live-in help. And there are interminably long repetitive segments. The sound track in annoying. Please save your money.
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|So great to hear John Fogerty at his best. Killer versions of classics and great new classics waiting to be recognized as Pure Fogerty. A revival.
B005K17RU0|2.0|It doesn't work on my Kindle HD for some reason.  I turned off the automatic locator so I think this may have something to do with it.  I love accuweather and use it on my pc rather then weather dotcom but I'm very disappointing in their app.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|I like classic country. This is it. She shows her skill and insight in a very well crafted and produced gem.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Beginners and experienced people can both benefit from reading this book. Will get you psyched to work out.  Highly recommend
B00B3EVNEE|4.0|Predictable but well done. Not a tour de force, but Trower is special and his backup is good enough to bring it home.
B00FVVR2ZO|5.0|Just wish it didn't take so long to get energy points without coins or crystals<br />But addicting just the same. Fun story line.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Took me back to their beginning. Excellent. Familiar riffs are presented with huge 21st century clarity and power and all in all, 13 is the best offering in forty years.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I cant do anything other than show chrome on the tv and watch youtube.  I dont have a netflix account.  When are we going to see Hulu or Amazon Prime Video?  Needs more support immediately.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am sleep deprived and living in a dusty house because I would rather play Candy Crush Saga than clean or sleep.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|ok for 4+? but a little too complicated for younger ones. too many text boxes to navigate before getting to game activities. maybe we'll try again in a year.
B006BOT28U|5.0|While The Goal got me excited about a new way of business thinking, It's Not Luck provides much more detail on he actual Thinking Processes, which you can use in any facet of life. Essential.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I cannot say enough about this! I am a huge Walking Dead fan so this was a must have of course. I also have the onmly soundtrack avaialble. I wish they would put another out soon, The music is intersting and is a reminder of the series and Zombies put down!
0385523394|5.0|Orange is the new black........ I enjoyed it. A nice quick read, odd at moments, horrific at others but an interesting description of incarceration.  It is different from the Netflix show.....but that's the way of the world.....books are different medium than that of TV. All in all I enjoyed it and would like to find out what happened 'after'.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. I have gotten really good ideas for home, make up and wardrobe from Pinterest. Thanks to Pinterest, I barely have to go on my facebook page.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Ms Harris it is definitely time to end this series..HBO has sensationalized this series which you can not top in your books..waaaaay out there!!!  you are putting your fans to sleep now!!!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I feel that it is relatively safe to say that no movie can stack up to the novel. While entertaining enough, most of the music was bordering on terrible to me, which is the main reason why I rate this film three of five stars.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|What can I say. Vince Gill does it again with this cd. Great harmonies and songs. Wonderful cd for any one's collection.<br />Very happy Vince put out this cd. love it.
1250038820|5.0|Best PHOTO book ever!!!<br />Worth every penny invested. Stop thinking too much and just BUY IT!!<br />Brandon Stanton is a GENIUS.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|Probably the best music done by the Moody Blues in that time period . top 5 overall .  The music is timeless.<br />A lot more people would appreciate the genius of Justin Hayward and John Lodge but radio won't play them.<br />The Beatles were the best rock and roll band in the 60's BUT the Moodies to this day are the ultimate crossover band<br />with exceptional arrangements and meaningful songs that will live on through the ages.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|&#34;Easy&#34; does not even begin to describe how impressive this little device is.  Set-up was a snap.  And I now find I'm using it for all kinds of things I'd never thought about (e.g., friends who were just back from Prague came over and we put Google Maps on the TV so they could show us everywhere we should visit on our upcoming trip there.)
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Love the movie, wish it would be a part 2. GREAT cast, you can't miss a min of the action
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Thank God for clues! Right when your about to give up, it all of a sudden makes sense. Great game
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|This movie is what I call a wasted opportunity.  The casting for this film was horrible.  Jaden Smith starts off with one of the worst narrations possible including a really terrible accent of some sort.  This film had some great visuals and was on the verge of being a really good sci fi throughout the film but kept falling short with the horrible acting of Jaden Smith.  I think had this film been the debut for a completely uknown actor in the lead role it could have catapulted them into sci fi fame but Jaden was the lead role unfortunately.  The Smith acting chops didn't gift the whole family.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Excellent graphics and gameplay. Gotta be careful with the in-game purchases though. Highly suggested! Warning to Kindle Fire HQ users, it drains the battery kind of fast.
B00F1OHD3M|1.0|This is a ridiculous mark-up when you can go to the Lego website and get the same exact set for $34.99.  Saying it lists for $99 and is on sale for $58.50 is a giant rip-off.  I hope people will do a comparison before buying.<br /><br />The set itself is great.  The price from this particular dealer is appalling!
B00006I53S|5.0|Initially I was little skeptical in buying a used lens, but later on went ahead and placed the order. I was surprised to see the lens was shipped on the same day of my placing the order and I received it with in two days. And when I received the lens,I was really delighted to see the product as it was exactly the same as mentioned in the description.<br /> I took some photographs when it snowed here in Pittsburgh last week and the result was far better than my existing 18-135. There is a slight whirring sound when I take close-ups on IS mode, but on doing a little research I found out that its a common problem with 28-135, so now I'm not worried about it. I even got a UV filter with this lens, so I do not have to spend additional $20-$30 dollars on it. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase and the seller.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Lovely graphics. Fun game you don't have to spend $$ on if you are patient. Quests are achievable and coins come in quite steadily with trading.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham's storyline had so many ups and downs it was hard to put the book down.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and have recommended it to all my friends.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Really good James Bond movie.  Daniel Craig is great as bond and this is a bit grittier and dark.  A nice change from the schlock of the 80's.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|I hesitated buying this one not being very impressed with anything from the Church after their 3rd release. However after my bud did buy it and we sat and listened to it I knew that yes I had to have it. It is not the metal cd of the year but it does kick ass. Ive been impressed with the releases from 80s bands this past couple of years. Point in case Krokus, Accept, Udo, Stryper, they just keep coming back with the ole reciepe for success and showing the new boys how to get it done. Who's next? Annihilator, Armored Saint, maybe even Metallica will come to their senses and put out what they have always been capable of doing. Nothing beats metal with the grass roots of the 80s and 90s.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so addicted to this game. It's lots of fun. And my 3 year old loves to help me match the colors.
0061124265|5.0|Veronika Decides To Die is a very interesting story with an unexpected twist. Coelho with his writing style draws you into the life of Veronika where you will feel like part of the story. My friend recommended this book after reading the French edition and then he read this one and he was very impressed. For the price you can not go wrong with this one of a kind novel
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Once in a great while I find a book that I can't put down......but four in a row is a wonderful! Now for #5.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|The man of steel is an average movie at best. The CGI is more impressive than the dialog, acting  and direction . It will make a ton of money, but I won't buy the dvd myself nor will I watch future installments if made by the same people. I wanted it to be a good film, but I frankly became bored before it ended. One thing that film makers just cannot get today, is that there are some of us out there that pay attention to details and plausibility. Is it plausible for a being with super strength to indirectly kill thousands of people in order to defeat the bad guys and the lone bad girl. Of course not. But it makes for more explosions and destruction, and that seems to sell movie tickets nowadays. I rarely go to the theatre to watch a movie anymore. I come from a generation that used to enjoy the experience of seeing a movie on the big screen and not having my senses being bombarded with profanity, cell phones, over the top special effects, implausible dialog, and popcorn that costs more that an average meal. I'm not saying they didn't make bad movies  way back when, but at least you knew going in that they were bad, case in point Plan 9 From Outer Space. Just my two cents.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I was surprised at the ending..I figured this to be a basic episode from the twilight zone. It held my attention and I really couldn't put it down until I finished it.  I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Big Patrick O'brian fan. Crowe is the perfect Aubrey. Presently re-reading the Aubrey-Maturin series and the film Master and Commander put a face on Jack Aubrey.
B00GIZO674|4.0|I'v have this game on both of my laptop and computer. So I just bought this app today for my kindle fire hd and been playing it non stop without any problems.
B000002KDM|5.0|he helped set the tone of the early 70's.<br />he is the definition of the singer songwriter.<br />where did all the coffee houses go.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|This app was ok. Takes a long time to load up. It freezes a lot and it hard to open. It takes a long time to download. And takes up a lot of room on device.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I love it I think it was a good idea to bring facebook games to kindle now I'm finally starting to enjoy my kindle
B00DXP7L88|5.0|This completes the series for me. It's been a great series! There are all the final episodes, of course, plus many extras and special features!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I realy liked this book, and especially the two main characters: Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, that you really cared for and were so brave and admirable.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  Beautifully written.  Can't wait to spend my next vacation in North Korea.  The author pulls you into the inner workings of the minds of his characters, and paints such a vivid picture of life in this totalitarian state that one feels as if you're living there as you read the book.  Don't miss out on this literary feast!
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|It makes me want to visit. There are a lot of missing letters in the Kindle ebook, I'm guessing they will be fixed.
0316322407|4.0|Very well written. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. People have been very negative when they say they want to read more about Malala and not her parents or the place where she was raised. I mean seriously guys you must understand that its her family and the place where she was raised that made her who she really is.<br />Highly recommended for the young children specially who take the luxury and freedom in America forgranted. Open your eyes kids to the real world.<br />I connected to Malala's soul which is simply beautiful. I journeyed through a different part of the world which seems unreal living in USA.I admire her courage and strength and her father for being a great support to her daughter in a place where women are ill treated and have no say in any matter. She is an inspiration for all the broken spirits who suffer everyday in the name of religion or considered being an inferior sex.<br />I hope many people feel the same way as I do.Job well done!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Really like this appl now that I've downloaded other free puzzle appls.  This appl has numerous free puzzles that you can customize the number of pieces (to over 200) and turn on piece rotation...all for free.  With other appls you only get a few puzzles (less than 20) and very low piece counts.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I periodically have trouble opening the appl but once I do, I have no issues using it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I can watch whatever I want in any country! Even full TV shows and movies. easy to use, love it
B00BEIYMIS|1.0|Utterly terrible. NO character development. NO believable characters. Actors who do not seem to be of the era they portray (muttonchops do not make you from the 70's). All around poor casting. The story was convoluted and you've literally seen every element of this movie in every other horror movie ever made. Even the ending was dull. I hated every minute of this cliche ridden poo-fest, simply can't believe this has an 87% on RT, NOTHING about this movie was scary or worth owning..glad I borrowed it.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like it I have Sean the movie also and I first thought you wouldn't control<br />the robot but I was wrong
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun game that make you have fast reflexes! I love that I can pick up the game and . Play when I have only a few minutes and easily come back to it later.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great quality. I love these movies and love them more on bluray. I don't get too caught up in special features but i love the case the movies came in and the book inside. The Price was great.
0446605409|5.0|A great author. I love hisbboks and all he writes. I want him to write more books faster and the same story line..
1904920209|5.0|lI bake bread evey week, This is the most different style of making bread I have ever  seen or heard  .  One has to watch Richard make bread to appreciate  the  method ..<br />Crazy thing to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Waiting for more lives is a waste of time. The game only lets you play a few times and then makes you wait 30 mins to play again. Pointless! Will not play again. Don't waste your time.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Good piccross game, my kids love the easier levels.  Easy to change from easy to hard and back again.  A must have if you like puzzles!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Book two, two days! In between working full time, cooking and keeping up a house.  Absolutely fantastic! Can't wait to start book three!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I had to read a memoir for school. I usually don't like reading but I couldn't even put this book down. The story is so real tat you can even put images in your head.<br />I recommend this book to anyone.
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|Won't let connect to Facebook and now I can't even play because it telling me to update and won't let me update. I have spent money on this game , please fix it.
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|The Power of Affirmations is a powerful and short book detailing how you can better your life -- through the power of belief; not belief in a higher power, but belief in yourself and belief in your own success.  It reminded me in some ways of the Landmark Forum, combined with the 12 steps of AA and some teachings of the Buddha.  Overall, I feel like we could all really improve ourselves by following the advice of Jon Bello.  As someone who's suffered from a lot of depression and self-doubt, this definitely helped me in a time of need!  Though I also have to admit, I was at times (with the part about talking to yourself in the mirror) reminded of an old SNL Stuart Smalley skit.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots on steroids.  The only thing better than watching two robots beating the gears out of each other is getting to control one of them.  Beautifully rendered graphics with straightforward, simple controls.  Challenging, yet designed so that you can advance without too much frustration and failure.  Works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire.
B002UWH8SS|2.0|YAWN! that pretty much sums it up. I watched it on DVD after reading the reviews and it was even slower than I expected. No real science because what they presented as science was hogwash. Boring plots, boring characters. The main storyline could have been a really interesting one but they messed that up completely. Not surprised it got cancelled this show is a failure.
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Anyone who presents using PowerPoint or Keynote should read this and understand how to make good visual presentations.<br /><br />HINT: You don't use the outline onscreen!<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who wants to keep the audience awake, delighted, and thrilled to spend money on your product or service.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was a bit embarrassed to be reading a &#34;young adult&#34; book, but the story was compelling it not a bit disturbing.  Nevertheless I could not put the book down.  I bought the next two in the series and enjoyed them too.  Could not wait for the first movie and now looking forward to the second.  Great series.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot. One of the things that's very important to me is Communication, being able to discuss anything with my partner. This is my number one, but it's not on the list. If people can't talk, they won't be able to discuss the book :(
B000N2HBSO|4.0|A good read.  I know Goodwin has gotten a lot of raves for this book and I did enjoy reading it, but I came away feeling empty-handed at the end.
B00DHKKN6Q|2.0|It's to easy I do not like it very much I think it is for people who like simple games......
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic writing and plot. My husband has read all the Wool, Shift and Dust books and says he's never read such amazing plot twists! I can't wait to continue the saga!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The boys really get a kick out of this game because it's similar to Minion Rush. We have this on the iPad mini and on the Kindle and the boys LOVE to 'race' each other. Love the Halloween graphics, too. And with Frankie (we call him that) chasing the character, it's even more exciting for the boys thinking someone is going to get them.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|Not the movie as I saw original and love this cast BUT sound quality made me return and you can't tell within first few minutes until they get into movie and suddenly lips moving and bit of noise but nothing you can really hear-oh yes, I have speakers and sound system aside from TV, it is this particular movie, sadly.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|if you like time games such as oregon trail and farmville you'll love this... plus they've got quests for individual characters like tapped out
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Love this series and love love this music. I'm not a huge fan of country but it's been growing on me!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great app, gets the job done easily... also there is no ads on it so those reviews about malware and crap are fake lol.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. David Sedaris always delivers. I simply an't wait to read another and another! Couldn't put it down ever.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is a good rpg game not only do you see a fight you control it. If you like reel steel this is the game for you.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|great game.<br />easy yet challenging. good overall fun. enjoy it. new. try it out. good job.  interesting. happy Anselm jokers
B00GHJ6BJW|2.0|There are a few songs that are not bad however overall this CD is terrible. I was very skeptical to purchase this, however the Amazon MP3 price along with a digital credit on my account made it less of a gamble. I am so glad that I did not pay the full price for this as I will probably only listen to a couple of the songs more than once and even those won't be played very often. I really enjoyed her other albums but this one is like nails on a chalkboard.
B004I744AS|4.0|It helps me find many other words. I can also get translations in different other languages. I need to find it on my laptop too. I do not know how I can get it.
B005HGZV6U|3.0|Good content, great music marred by standard DVD quality picture and sound. Sure it says DTS-HD but don't be fooled, it's a poor signal for blu ray.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Cool game, cool cars, cool levels of racing. Work through all the races , get more upgrades to keep wining races.
B00EYE0ECW|4.0|The map does not have street views of addresses but does provide appropriate directions.  The Google map application is easy to use ad will be useful with simple travel plans.
