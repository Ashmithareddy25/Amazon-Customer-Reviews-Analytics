B0015AARJI|5.0|The PS3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller is, in my opinion, the best controller for the system.  If your PS3 is backwards compatible, like mine, it will work with all your PS3, PS2 and PS1 games.  The buttons are very sturdy and responsive.  If you've been with Sony since the days of the PS1, you will feel right at home with this controller.  That's what I like about it, in fact.  The controller layout has remain the same.  No need to fix what isn't broken.<br /><br />What I like about this controller over the original Sixaxis is that it is slightly heavier which gives it a nice feel when it's in your hand.  I've been playing with this new controller for over a year now and it's still going pretty strong.  I would highly recommend this controller to anyone with a PS3.

0865478570|5.0|Bellos does a wonderful job in answering the questions you never thought to ask about translation, and greatly increases your respect for good translators (translators are already held in much higher esteem outside of the English speaking world).  There are also all kinds of delightful nuggets of information.  My only complaint is that Bellos spends too much time answering some of the \\"big\\" questions, probably because historically they have been  controversial or answered incorrectly;  fortunately, while Bellos is occasionally too wordy for my taste, he recognizes  good examples are  the best way to make a point.       The purpose of translation is to convey the thought, not the exact words, and for this context is very important.  Often there are not one to  one equivalences in words; for example Russian has two different words for light blue and dark blue, but not one word for blue.  Japanese has many words for translations, depending on type of subject matter or form being translated, such as poetry, but not one word which simply means translation.     Translation gets particularly tricky when a thought  relies on a well known cultural proverb, which would be meaningless in another language. A translation need not \\"sound\\" foreign.  If well translated, the cultural differences should come across without that crutch.  On the other hand, if there are some nouns like kinds of government officials with no equivalent, it may be best to use the foreign word, thereby perhaps enhancing the target language.  If a speaker is using a local dialect, do you translate by using a local dialect in the target language?  Not so clear.   Subtitles in movies are constrained by length, so dubbing may actually be the superior way to enjoy a foreign movie; however, Americans are less tolerant of the mismatch in dubbing between lip movement and words than many other cultures.   Repair manuals these days are often written in a subset of  language expression, just to facilitate translations.  Google translates by finding  expressions already translated and uses statistical methods for choosing between the translations it finds.  Like in other fields, human aided computer intelligence may be the future of much of translation.   I would skip the final \\"afterbabble\\" chapter.  In developing a theory for the origin of speech, Bellos neglects the fact that speech provides several advantages over gesture , like being  useful when the speaker cannot be seen due to darkness or forest.
B005PW3OS8|2.0|I like all kinds of movies...action, drama, comedy, romance, documentary, etc. I have an attention spam beyond that of many. But when I watch an action film I want action and it took 90 minutes to get there on a thin plot line. Painful. .

1451627289|5.0|Ever since books like Thinner, I have been waiting for another book that could chain me to a chair.  You know the kind.  Your house is on fire, people are screaming for you to get out, and all you can think is just a few more lines then I can leave.  LOL!  I'm so glad it wasn't my house or I would have been toast!  This book is great! I had grown so tired of the same stories with differing names and places.  I've even grown to hate cliffhangers;  by the time the new one comes out, I've already read 30-40 other books doing the same thing.  Thank you, thank you, thank you Stephen King for not dropping me after 300-400 pages; for engaging my imagination without insult; for taking something familiar and weaving it into something incredible!  No one juggles back stories without missing a beat like you do, no one.    This last point may seem trivial to some, but to me it is as important as the story itself.  This book is well edited!  The words flow like a well oiled machine.  I didn't experience any sudden urges to get a red pen and mark up all of the grammatical errors.  LOL  Wow, thanks again!

0385535139|5.0|I've read most of Mr. Grisham's previous novels, but this one is one of the best. It takes his reader into the world of law firms that are the bottom-feeders at the fringes of ethical legal practice: they go after cases that other lawyers wouldn't touch. The lawyers in this story have their own reasons for doing what they do, but the story unfolds wonderfully as they take on a case which might be their salvation. The personalities are all realistic and believable, and the story takes twists and turns which are fun to follow as well as informative to anyone who's curious about legal procedures, both in abstract terms and as they are really practiced.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really good book. There is alot of action and I never put it down! I loved it. The action in it is so descriptive, I saw it through the book.

My most favorite songs on this album are \\"Most High\\",\\"Shining In The Light\\", and \\"Please Read The Letter\\". These guys have continuously knocked my socks off since when I was but a wee laddy. Good Stuff!!

B004BLJQOK|5.0|Horror is not my typical first choice for movies.But I'd heard so many good things about this movie that I went ahead and got it. I've liked it a lot. As actresses go,Chloe Grace Moretz has been one of the busiest in the business,especially for a young person.She and her older brother seem like a great couple of folks.Keep up the good work,Y'all.

B005D9B26E|3.0|Remastered CDs = great  Demo CDs = great  Book = best part of the whole set  5.1 EP = worst part of the set  I've become a huge fan of 5.1 surround in the past few years, and I was really disappointed that this box set only contains half of the album in surround. In my experience with surround releases, it's usually the whole album or nothing, and in this case I'm not really sure what I'd rather have...

B002G1YPH0|5.0|I purchased the Hyper 212 Plus for use in a new PC build, I used this with a Core i5-2500k and a [[ASIN:B005FE52X6 ASRock MB-Z68X4G3 LGA 1155 Intel Z68 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard]]. The 212+ was just tall enough to clear the [[ASIN:B004RFBIUU Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM Dual Channel Memory Kit CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B]]. I added a second fan ([[ASIN:B0030DL37I Cooler Master BladeMaster 120mm PWM High Air Flow Silent Case Fan R4-BMBS-20PK-R0]])for a push-pull config and at idle speeds its so quiet I can't hear it above the noise of the other fans in the system. With the 2500k clocked at 4.4GHz at idle I'm at 29c-30c and with all four cores loaded it never goes above 60c.   For the price it's at, its a steal.

B003V4AK8E|2.0|Do not buy this controller and plan on using it for fps games. I like the feel of the contr. but the joysticks are at times unresponsive. I bought this because I like the 360 controller more, so I figured I'd try to get one with that set up for ps3. Plus the price influenced my decision a bit. However, you get what you pay for. Dont be cheap, get the sony controller if you play fps games.    DO NOT BUY FOR FPS GAMES!

B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I would like to be able to say I enjoyed this book but sadly it was actually a chore to read it.  When the  contrived ending became obvious I felt emotionally  manipulated and had to force myself to finish the book. Every plot development was a stock development telegraphed well before it actually occurred. While there were some emotional truths scattered ever so lightly throughout the book nothing was ever really explored through well written dialogue- much of the book was simply told to the reader by the narrator. Nothing new or original here- just a book designed to be a tear jerker read with cardboard cut-out characters. Not worth the money or the time.
B0019NG73G|5.0|This movie is totally awesome. It had a lot more in it than the original movie did. I feel it is a very informative movie of the civil war. I don't think any of us in this time of our lives know exactly what those fellows went through in that war. We ought to be thanking everyone that has fought in a war for our freedom.

B004J3QACQ|5.0|Your blues-loving family and friends will certainly love you if you present them with this wonderful CD box set. \\"The Perfect Blues Collection\\" contains 25 classic blues albums in miniature LP sleeves, some with bonus tracks (get out your magnifying glass to read the liner notes), as well as a booklet with track listings, recording information, and additional notes in English and French. The recordings were originally issued between 1951 and 2003 by Columbia, RCA, and other major labels now owned by Sony. This collection is usually available brand new from Amazon resellers for less than $40, or about $1.50 per disc. What a deal!<br /><br />A complete list of the CDs in the set:<br /><br />1) Bessie Smith - The Bessie Smith Story<br />2) Big Bill Broonzy - Big Bill Blues<br />3) Little Richard - Little Richard & Buck Ram<br />4) Mahalia Jackson - Live at Newport 1958<br />5) Chuck Willis - Wails the Blues<br />6) Elvis Presley - For LP Fans Only<br />7) Jimmy Witherspoon - In Person<br />8) Robert Johnson - King of the Delta Blues Singers<br />9) Sonny Boy Williamson & Memphis Slim - Sonny Boy Williamson & Memphis Slim<br />10) Aretha Franklin - Unforgettable: A Tribute to Dinah Washington<br />11) Son House - Father of Folk Blues<br />12) Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson & Larry Williams - Two for the Price of One<br />13) Champion Jack Dupree - Anthologie du Blues, Vol. 1<br />14) Otis Spann with Fleetwood Mac - The Biggest Thing Since Colossus<br />15) Johnny Winter - Johnny Winter<br />16) Percy Mayfield - Sings Percy Mayfield<br />17) The Johnny Otis Show - Live at Monterey!<br />18) Willie Dixon - I Am the Blues<br />19) Hubert Sumlin & His Friends - Kings of Chicago Blues<br />20) Taj Mahal - The Real Thing<br />21) Muddy Waters - Hard Again<br />22) Stevie Ray Vaughan & Double Trouble - Texas Flood<br />23) Keb Mo - Just Like You<br />24) Etta James - Life, Love & the Blues<br />25) Buddy Guy - Blues Singer<br /><br />Quibblers may object to the inclusion of releases by rock, R&B, soul, and gospel artists like Elvis Presley, Little Richard, Aretha Franklin, and Mahalia Jackson, but these musical immortals felt the blues deeply and performed it with conviction (and in the case of Richard and Aretha, they still do). Their albums perfectly complement essential blues men and women like Robert Johnson, Bessie Smith, Son House, Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Etta James, and Buddy Guy.<br /><br />Also recommended are \\"The Perfect Jazz Collection\\" and \\"The Perfect Country Collection,\\" matching import boxes from Sony.

B005COO1X6|5.0|This was fabulous although I found it vaguely reminiscent of Stephen King's story about a group of teenagers that swim out to a dock in the middle of a lake. Only to be picked off one at a time by this black substance that oozes its way under them. I did enjoy the read but I wish I had known it was only a short story. I felt in hindsight,had I known that, I would not have paid $2.99 for it. As an e-book it should have been $.99.

0525423281|5.0|What can I say? Stephanie Perkins creates contemporary magic. LOLA AND THE BOY NEXT DOOR was witty, and quite simply, irresistible. I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Perkins hooked me with the mystery on why the main character, Lola, had such built up anger at Cricket, the boy next door. Now I will say the name Cricket threw me off. It didn't exactly scream hot guy. BUT it fit the love interests character. Cricket was quirky, just like his name.<br /><br />The narrative Perkins created with Lola felt authentic. I totally believed she was that rebellious chick from my high school who didn't give a damn about what people thought about her clothes. She was only concerned about pleasing her inner artist. So it was awesome to tap into a character like that. Lola was totally kick ass, and I loved her.<br /><br />Lola's older boyfriend, Max was definitely a hot character. And let's face it, there's something alluring about older guys to teenage girls. Rebellion comes to mind. I loved reading about them. The last YA novels that come to mind with an older love interest was Vampire Academy and Going To Far. So it was great to read that same twist here. Added some spice. Plus he was a rocker. Who doesn't like reading about HOT rocker dudes?<br /><br />Another thing I liked about this novel was the cameo appearance by Anna and St. Clair from ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS. I freakin' loved that book and was so happy to read a little more about them.<br /><br />So if you are a YA contemporary fan, add this one to your list!
159562015X|4.0|This is a great book, I used it for school but it is a good life and professional tool. If you buy new it comes with the code for the assessment, worth it.
B00417HV14|5.0|Joe Banamassa takes a real step forward in his performance on this DVD. After watching the DVD, I was truly happy for Joe Banamassa, that such a magnificent performance was captured for all eternity. Great performances, with feel, dynamics, emotion, polish and some nice guest surprises. Also, there is a bit of a story-line underlying the Royal Albert Hall performace that ties in with one of the guest apperances; full circle kind of thing I found endearing. If blues guitar (with updates) is your thing, this DVD is a good bet. Enjoy!
B003Y5H574|1.0|I was absolutely shocked at how much I hated this movie. The plot moved painfully slow, and was almost 100% predictable.

B003K16P3M|4.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  It was a splendid execution of a classical tale with a bit of a twist.<br /><br />The writing style of Kristin Cashore is quite pleasant, although a bit flowery at times.  It is a nice change to the typical language style offered to the YA audience.  In my opinion, there are two divisions in the YA scene, one intended for children in the 11-15 age range (like Twilight) and then the other side of the spectrum is truly offered for young adults: 16-25ish (like the Hunger Games, for example).  This one, while certainly able to be enjoyed by the younger end of the spectrum is actually better for older teens, maybe early twenties.  The prose is witty and complex, the themes and characters well-developed.  Although Katsa is a very interesting mix for a heroine.  She has some annoying qualities, but is quite enjoyable due to her character's complexities.<br /><br />I like that the \\"graced\\" people have something outwardly noticeable about them.  It's a little different than the usual supernaturals who look like everyone else.  I like the romance that the novel cultivates.  It is not over or underdone as is the case in so many  novels.  Usually, I'm either left feeling gipped, or I'm skimming the paragraphs because it's a bit too detailed for my liking.<br /><br />Although fairly blatantly anti-marriage, this is an entertaining read.  Also, (as others have mentioned) to be noted:  There are some sexual scenes which although not explicit, do not simply hint at what is going on.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it to a friend to read.  :)
B005KDWUFA|5.0|Extremely talented group...awesome sounding, love this CD. Saw them one night on tv, discovered by accident by Simon...wow...I love so many types of music but those that can sing acappella (spelling is correct, to sing without music)and blend so nicely truly have a gift.

1442344989|1.0|It's nearly impossible to accurately describe how badly this book is written. Possibly the worst book I've ever had the misfortune of reading, certainly in a very long time. The author's utterly harrowing story is presented so ineptly, so disjointedly and awkwardly, you just keep skipping ahead hoping it gets better. It doesn't. In the entire book, there's no real insight into how the author feels: regarding her captors, her lost childhood, her family, anything. I would think the fault lies with the editors, who are presenting this devastating story in such an appalling fashion. A real lost opportunity. I've read the book andI still can't begin to imagine what the author went through.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Reviews seem polarized - one either hates it or loves it.  My family and I all loved it.  Spies and intrigue, wild car races, and Michael Cain.  What's not to like?  I will admit that this film was more \\"bloody\\" (oiley?) than other animations, and that the violence was more realistic than Bugs Bunny violence.  (What isn't?)  But, like my son says in a deadpan voice, \\"Seriously?\\"  It's a bit hard to take animated violence seriously.  Finally, the film itself has an important message (seems to be a trademark for kid's films) concerning true friendship and acceptance of others as they are.<br /><br />Love it or hate it, you make the call.  My family and I loved it.

We've come to enjoy Bones TV series a great deal, and we enjoy watching the shows in the order of their production, thus buying the complete season makes great sense for us.
0596804822|1.0|Maybe a long time ago (maybe not so long) this was a very useful book. But right now, when trying to learn from it using xcode 4.2, and spending hours going trough the first chapter I find out that even the first program wont compile! So I do a little digging by myself and i find out that many others are having the same problem. If this is a beginners book, then it is way too hard to know what should and should not be changed to make it xcode 4.2 compatible.
B003TQKVGU|2.0|The beginning of this book is pretty good. The author does show us how to work with and train our subconscious. After awhile though, it just becomes one self-healing story after another, and a lot of Bible references. I had to skim 3/4 of this book.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I purchased the FiiO E5 headphone amp primarily to boost the audio levels in some of my devices on loud airplane rides. It does provide a slight improvement, but not drastic. The amp performs as expected and where it really delivers is on some of my portable audio units as an improvement on sound quality overall. It does provide a noticeable hiss with some players, but not too annoying. I'm satisfied with this purchase at this price point and would recommend it to anyone trying to get a little bit better sound out of their device in a convenient and small package.

B002BWP49C|5.0|I've seen this movie twice, and it was excellent. Can't wait to buy it when it comes out. There was a few parts that were hiliarious, and the whole movie was intense.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Agree with everyone else. The developer needs to fix the fact that you cannot scroll down to see mote than 10 emails
1400052181|5.0|This book is such an easy read and reads like a novel.  For a first book for Rebecca Skloot, she did such an excellent job in researching and writing about the family, the doctors involved in Mrs. Lacks' case and about other similar cases where cells were used for medical study.  Overall a great book for any biology enthusiast.  It definitely also deals with ethical matters of extracting cells from someone's body without the consent of the patient nor the family's consent.  I strongly encourage this book to be your next read.

B001HN6922|4.0|We've already watched it at least 20 times. The best thing was that it arrived on the day it was released in stores and not after. We came home after the fall storm and had the movie before we even had our power back!

B001ILFUD2|4.0|I remember when I was a little kid seeing this movie for the first time in theaters. I loved every moment of it. It was one of those films that really left an imprint on my childhood. Growing up I so wanted to watch it again, but Disney wasn't releasing it on video. It wasn't until 1996 that Disney decided to release this under-appreciated gem.   Having watched it again as an adult, does it hold the same magic. In a sense, yes. The story is a beautiful one, full of charm, inspired by Dicken's classic, Oliver Twist. Instead of using an orphan boy, this movie focuses on an orphan cat named, - you guessed it - Oliver! The story of his friendship with the dogs and the homeless man Fagen, along with the conflict created by being adopted by a new pet-owner, Jenny, creates a fun and touching story. Billy Joel is amazing, full of flare, as the dog Dodger. Cheech Marine does a great job as the yappy Chihuahua Tito. My favorite character in the film is Francis, the English Bulldog who can quote Shakespeare. The villain in this film is one of the scariest villains in a Disney pictures, Sykes, a ruthless loan shark who seems too close to reality for comfort.   So, with great characterization, witty humor and classy songs, why is this movie only four stars instead of five? It's because as an adult, as much as I love it, it left me wanting just a little more. I fell so in love with the gang of dogs, and Oliver, and Fagan that I would have loved more screen time to develop these characters. The transition between Fagan to Jenny happened way too early in the film. I understand that since this movie is geared towards younger children that they had to keep it shorter, but I don't think it would have hurt to have had fifteen more minutes of screen time for developing the above said characters. On the contrary, I think it would have worked wonders.   Still, all in all, this is a fun-filled film, a gem, and an underrated Disney film.
0553381695|5.0|In the second book of this lengthy series, I found it just as hard to put down as the first one. The characters are so interesting and the plot so imaginative, I just can't help but wonder how writers come up with such great stuff.  Same as the first, I loved the character of Daenerys the most, and still find that she is not in the book as much as she should be. I hope we see more of her in the future books. I am predicting that she and Robb Stark will either marry or form an alliance to invade the seven kingdoms and put her on the throne. That would be really cool. As far as this book was concerned, I loved every minute and unlike the first one, I won't waist any time progressing to the next one, \\"A Storm of Swords\\".
030788743X|3.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is a speculative dystopian novel about a world struggling with a global energy crisis, melting polar ice caps, and a 30-year-old recession. Wade Watts, the book's narrator and protagonist, finds himself in the middle of all this turmoil. Wade, an eighteen-year-old getting ready to graduate high school, is whole-heartedly devoted to finding the first of three hidden keys in an online virtual reality known as OASIS. Whoever finds the key will be one step closer to inheriting the $240 billion fortune left by the game's creator.  Cline's work is almost hopelessly dedicated to 80s pop culture exposition. The creator of OASIS, James Halliday, was obsessed with this time period, and the individuals questing for his \\"Easter egg\\" spend most of their time replaying video game classics and brushing up on obscure 80s movie trivia. I see two reasons for this; either Cline is appealing to the more nostalgic members of his generation, or Halliday's obsession with the 1980s is simply a reflection of Cline's own obsession.   I'm arguing for the latter. In fact, the entire book was constructed to fit the needs of Cline himself. Cline's vision of the future is a commentary on the issues that plague our society today. Climate change, resource wars, high gas prices, and indefinite economic recession are all key contemporary issues that play a fundamental role in the construction of Cline's dystopia. Cline also uses his narrator, Wade Watts, to postulate his own views on everything from religion to public education. Even the major driving force of the novel, $240 billion left to whoever can remember the most obscure 80s factoids and successfully navigate an online virtual reality, is less a likely scenario (The story of Halliday reminds me all too much of the passing of Apple's Steve Jobs, who apparently didn't have the decency to fashion a bizarre contest and leave his fortune to the winner.) and more the fantasy of a daydreaming Cline, who has clearly spent a lot of time in front of an Atari. While reading Ready Player One, the reader gets the sense that he or she is roaming around in a world fashioned specifically for Cline and others like him, making the work nearly inaccessible to any other audience.   Maybe Cline wants things that way. Maybe he doesn't need any other audience. After all, the work has already met with wide success. An entire mixtape on Grooveshark marks every reference in the book that can be enjoyed through the ears. A Google search of \\"ready player one\\" reveals countless numbers of so-called \\"geeks\\" reviewing the work and praising Cline for his fountain of classic video game knowledge. And most recently, Warner Brothers purchased the film rights to Cline's work, so those of us who enjoyed Cline's work will be able to watch the magic unfold on the big screen. I might be there, but only so I can allude to it in my dystopian novel loaded with obscure 2010s pop-culture references.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I previously saw this film on the screen at our local movie theater.  Viewing it for the first time on my home system was both a delight and revelation.  Things I had not noticed in the theater almost jumped out when viewing it at home.  The quality was excellent even in the DVD format (until I get a new blu-ray player I will have to wait for the \\"blu-ray\\" experience)    As far as the movie itself goes I recommend not even watching this one UNLESS you have Part 2 in hand.  The desire to complete the story is stronger than the desire to start a new movie the previous parts (1-6) left the viewer with.    If it's been a while since you have viewed the other parts in this series the first thing that presents itself is how much these characters have aged and then how much they have, and have not, changed emotionally and mentally.  Three 17 year old kids off on a lark they are not and the uncertainty, doubt and fear they experience can be seen and, at times, even felt.

1451648537|5.0|This book is excellent. As a biographical work, it's fantastic. I found the style engaging and immersive. Tons of industry insight and multiple windows into not only the mind of a genius, but also the incredible influence he had on the tech industry - from the Breakout game to the iPad and beyond...   I loved the amount of detail around design, creation, marketing and manufacturing some of the worlds most loved gadgets.  As someone who is very focused on user experience, I already loved a lot about what Apple does. This book gives insight into one of the greatest consumer product makers in history.

0393064476|1.0|The grandiose subtitle of The Swerve -- \\"How the World Became Modern\\" -- is not a real argument Stephen Greenblatt wanted to make in this or any book. Rather, it is the dull edge of his and his publisher's dishonest marketing scheme to make a superficial, sub-scholarly book sound revelatory. Nowhere does Greenblatt actually claim that Epicureanism, Lucretius or the rediscovery of De rerum natura made the world \\"modern.\\" Greenblatt just feels they must have had *something* significant to do with it. To this vague thesis he adds further confusion by frequently characterizing Christianity as being opposed to Epicureanism and modernity even though every figure he credits as having aided in the spread of Epicureanism was a Christian or some type of theist. Frequently (but most often buried in his endnotes), Greenblatt quietly admits this opposition between Christianity and Epicureanism is historically baseless. He qualifies his tendentious points so much it's clear they are simply the wrong points to try to make.<br /><br />Greenblatt is at his best when he is illuminating history and advancing a very specific argument by telling a thick, highly contextualized story. His notoriously speculative claims are at least plausible, complete, and reasonably specific when they are based on intricate, well-sourced details. Unfortunately, the only parts of The Swerve that meet this standard are the chapters focused on Poggio Bracciolini and his world in Florence or the papal court. The material on the ancient world is much slighter. Much of it is nothing more than facile polemic against the church in its first centuries, which Greenblatt manages to present as a monolithic, oppressive force even when Christians were being fed to lions.<br /><br />Medievalists will not appreciate Greenblatt's treatment of later Christianity either. He reduces nearly a millenia in the Latin west to a portrait of self-flagellating, corrupt, ignorant monks and nuns. Renaissance and Reformation scholars can only be embarrassed by the complete lack of recognition of reform movements before and after the Protestant Reformation began that Greenblatt must concede were far more enlightening and progressive in their impact than Lucretius.  Worst of all, there is no depth coverage of the modern era at all in a book that purports to be about exactly that. Nowhere does Greenblatt even attempt to define modernity. Contemporary experts on that subject (e.g., Charles Taylor) are absent from his notes and bibliography. The last chapter rushes through a half dozen major figures and issues from the 16th to the 19th centuries to end with some paragraphs about Thomas Jefferson, apparently Greenblatt's idea of the greatest modern Epicurean.<br /><br />Even if you take The Swerve as being more of a personal case for Epicureanism rather than a historical study of its transmission and influence, Greenblatt hamstrings his efforts by refusing to engage the most substantial challenges to Epicureanism as an ethically and politically viable philosophy. Like Jefferson's fellow slave-owing Roman predecessors, Greenblatt never seriously considers that the idea of organizing society based on individual pleasure-seeking might in practice be no different than unchecked self-interest of any kind. Nothing in Epicureanism specifically rules out the exploitation of carefully maintained servile populations. Machiavelli's view of religion as useful in maintaining a servile public is briefly mentioned, but Greenblatt characterizes Machiavelli as a skeptical fellow traveller. Thomas More's portrayal of the same idea in Utopia, however, is attacked as reaction against Epicureanism because More seems to indicate (like Plato) that fear of death and divine judgment are needed to keep most people from behaving destructively. Examples abound of Greenblatt prejudicially playing favorites like this, which may just speak to his deeply conflicted feelings about religion. Much like his telling of Poggio's life, Greenblatt may be reluctant to accept that truth does not necessarily support social order, and social order is not the same as justice, but you can't have justice without order.<br /><br />Curiously, whereas Hamlet in Purgatory started with an anecdote about Greenblatt following his father's wishes to be remembered in traditional Jewish prayers for the dead, The Swerve begins with an anecdote about Greenblatt's mother suffering from and inflicting upon her son considerable anxiety about death. From this story Greenblatt embarks on his real argument, which is not that the modern world is Epicurean but that it isn't Epicurean nearly enough, thanks to the continued prevalence of religious ideas that keep people afraid of death and dying. Whereas the earlier book took seriously the idea that religious beliefs and superstition can provide real personal and societal benefits regardless of their truth or falsity, The Swerve swerves in the opposite direction, portraying religion as a wholly negative force. Whatever the cause, this makes for a shallow and immature book that really ought to be about the ways that ancient, medieval and early modern European elites (Christians all) entertained and preserved (rather than obstructed) a tradition of radical skepticism up until tolerance for it was broken and elites were driven by the ideological polarization and social upheaval of the 16th century into either dogmatic camps or a slowly opening secular space defined by scientific rationalism and increasingly indifference if not hostility to religion.enblatt may be reluctant to accept that truth does not necessarily support social order, and social order is not the same as justice, but you can't have justice without order.<br /><br />Curiously, whereas Hamlet in Purgatory started with an anecdote about Greenblatt following his father's wishes to be remembered in traditional Jewish prayers for the dead, The Swerve begins with an anecdote about Greenblatt's mother suffering from and inflicting upon her son considerable anxiety about death.

B004LWZW8I|3.0|This movie seems to have polarized viewers and reviewers. Paid reviewers, for the most part, have not liked it. John Q, on the other hand, seems to have liked it a lot....for what it is.  Here's the scoop. Theseus (Henry Cavill) needs to find the Epirus Bow before King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) finds it and uses it to set the Titans free to decimate all mankind. Theseus will get help from a virgin oracle and the Gods themselves to accomplish this mission.  I like the director Tarsem Singh. His first outing \\"The Cell\\" was a decent script with a great look. His follow-up \\"The Fall\\" was a great script with a great look. \\"Immortals\\" seems more the child of the producers. It looks as though they were trying to capitalize on the success of their earlier \\"300.\\" The overall look is very similar but I have to imagine Singh had a big hand in this. The costumes and set design are extensions of his earlier efforts. This movie looks great. Every shot is a feast for the eyes. The effects are seamless and the slow motion violence is really cool. Seeing heads explode like this is.....unique.  Cavill has a good, heroic screen presence. Rourke plays a great villain. He is so casual about killing it made my skin crawl. Freida Pinto as Phaedra is a real knockout. Stephen Dorf was good as Stavros but he seemed out of place somehow. John Hurt and Stephen McHattie were good in their small-ish rolls. One review I read complained about the slowness of it. I can't say I disagree but, at the same time, I wasn't getting fidgety so it mustn't have been too bad. This is an epic, myth based movie. Tarsem Singh does a lot to bring the sense of myth to the look and feel of it all. I'm chomping at the bit to see his upcoming \\"Mirror Mirror.\\"  I cannot say I liked this quite as much as \\"300\\" but this is still a heck of a ride. When it hits Blu-Ray I will definitely add it to my library. It will stand up to repeat viewings.

B004A8ZWVU|4.0|The Help is a maid for Oscar story of Mississippi maids set in 1963 based on the literary phenomenon. There is no black president. There is no daughter and granddaughter of a maid who has had a talk show for 25 years. Now is the time to go deep into the south, to peer through the bent back tulips, to see how the other half lives, to explore the life of the black maid against the burgeoning backdrop of the civil rights movement.   Life is not fair if you are a black maid. Some people say fair is foul and foul is fair. Some will not just say it, but prove it.   Eugenia aka Skeeter personifies the progressive educated female. Well traveled, broad minded, she hopes to become a writer in New York. Returning to Jackson she discovers that her maid from childhood has mysteriously disappeared.   Hilly Holbrook, the antagonist, childhood friend of Sketer, queen bee housewife personifies the status quo, with her bouffed up sprayed in place hair, and a WITCH (Woman In Total Control of Herself) glint in her eye, she campaigns for a law requiring people with home help to build an additional toilet for the help only, the Home Health Sanitation Initiative. She proclaims that she promotes 'separate but equal,' and warns her friend Skeeter that there are 'real racists' in this town. If everyone is equal then why do they need to be separate?   Hilly will find a suitable match for her friend Skeeter.   Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play long suffering maids Aibileen and mouthy Minny respectively. One embittered, tragic, looks Oprahesque, the other sassy.   The toilet becomes a recurring symbol, metaphor, inciting incident, turning point. Other symbols include the maid uniform, the bus, pies, the ring, Crisco, and grits.   So the sweltering summer of our discontent may become glorious Autumn with this story of suffering maids, and their condition may be made better by writing an anonymous tell all book. It may also be maide worse.   Minny caught short during a severe storm asks insistently to use the house bathroom. Hilly refuses. She goes. The WITCH, boiling with anger, bangs on the door. The maid without peeing insolently flushes the toilet to get under her bosses skin. The narrator says: 18 people died in that storm, 10 white, 8 black.   When Aibileen tells her tragic story I could feel emotion welling in my chest and while remaining in the moment was transported to Oscar night, where they show the scene from the movie. When Skeeter (Emma Stone)did her monologue, I had a similar somewhat intense experience. It takes great talent to evoke that kind of response.   Rarely do you get such a strong ensemble with a mostly female cast, with such well written acting roles. The movie Doubt also starring Viola Davis, got four Oscar nominations for acting, and I expect this movie will get several acting nominations including a second nomination for her, perhaps victory this time.  While I loved how these relationships worked, and how the movie plays on our emotions it has story weaknesses. Specifically, the lack of a strong inciting incident. The story could have been strengthened if Medgar Evers was a character. As he lived in Jackson at the time, how difficult would it be to have one or two scenes with him in it, and then we would be much more emotionally involved in the real life event of his assassination by a 'real' racist.   Shortly after watching this I watched In the Heat of the Night, and Gran Torino, which I consider a masterpiece, although it's politically incorrect, and therefore did not win any Oscars. It had to settle for being hugely popular. While both explore racial tension and explicit racism through a masculine lens, The Help explores a more shaded implicit racism of denial through a feminine lens. The covert racism of going along to get along, bowing to peer pressure, not daring to risk punishment by social exclusion.   If you're like me you may wonder how it is relevant to today, when we have Obama in the White House, Oprah in our living rooms, and Beyonce topping the charts. Racism still exists, except that nowadays we are very polite about it, we may even be in denial about it like Hilly. She refuses her maid a loan, hires and fires maids left, right and center, yet raises money for children in Africa. She says separate but equal, but does not mean equal. If a landlord says to someone I won't rent you a house becuse you can't afford it, or because I have already rented it, or your credit is not strong enough, he may mean something else entirely.  Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly could win an Oscar. Her gleeful wicked witch of the West meets Cruella De Ville performance, at first deceptively inconsequential builds throughout the movie, reaching an impressive crescendo. I hope she and Viola Davis can both win by being nominated in different categories.   Minny wants equality, yet when Celia Foote sits at her table, and treats her like an equal, her conditioning kicks in and she asks her to sit elsewhere. I liked that her character was more active.   Emma Stone could get an Oscar nom. She is a crusader, and does battle adversity but she is not the subject of adversity, and does not have a dog in the fight. The stakes are less serious for her.   I liked Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain, as poor white trash married into money. She has no understanding of the social norms, and status, because she apparently was raised on Mars. She has a Jayne Mansfield body.   I feel pretty certain that The Help will be nominated for best picture, and the issue of race relations has been well favored in the past for example, the movie Crash, won with a similar theme. What will prevent if from winning is that though it is popular it takes no risks, also it presents the issue in a comedic way. From a masculine point of view, I yearned for a major events and turning points, for some crash bang wallop, but that desire was left unfulfilled.  Each year Oscars get awarded for mostly two types of roles:   1. A person battling adversity, mental illness, social discrimination, physical or mental handicap of some kind, the underdog. A stuttering king, as in Colin Firth, a mentally ill ballerina as in Natalie Portman, a crusader as in Sandra Bullock, or Hilary Swank, or Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich. Hattie McDaniel won playing a maid and a slave in Gone with the wind set in 1863.   2. The psychopath sociopath. Anthony Hopkins Silence of the Lambs, Javier Bardem No Country for old men, Kate Winslet in The Reader. Angelina Jolie as a sociopathic mental in Life interrupted. Charlize Theron as serial killer. A racist housewife could fall in this category.  If you like The Help, I recommend you also see [[ASIN:B003Y5H4Y8 The Debt]], a brilliant suspense thriller also starring Jessica Chastain, with Helen Mirren. If you are like me, I think you will be amazed at how talented JC is in a leading role. It's my favorite movie of the 60 or so I have seen this year. She also plays the lead actress in The Tree of Life [Blu-ray] which I recommend somewhat cautiously. I don't know if you will like the movie, but I think you will love her performance.   If you do decide to get The Help, I recommend you also watch [[ASIN:B001KVZ6ES Gran Torino (+ BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]], Mississippi Burning or In the Heat of the night, because all have similar themes with some crash bang wallop.  I hope you found this review helpful, and I think you will enjoy the movie.

0060873027|1.0|The title sums it up better than any detailed review ever could.  The book's characters are shrunk to 1/2 an inch tall and get eaten by various bugs.  Bad guy gets stupid comeuppance at the end.  The male and female leads incredibly strike up a romance.  The female lead also happens to be a macho karate expert, who amazingly has a vulnerable side, because she still wants to be loved, and the male is a hated misanthrope who turns out to be a noble and capable hero when the chips are down.  The formulaic conceit of this book is stunning.    This write-by-numbers nonsense is NOTHING like a Michael Crichton novel.  His books went into great detail clarifying the technical background which set the stage for the unfolding plot.  His characters were usually indeed very intelligent, but they had (with a few exceptions towards the end of Crichton's writing) believable, sharp dialogue and didn't walk around spouting technical jargon about plant horomones, speciesism, and spider venom in everyday conversation, as if that was somehow normal.  The characters in this book, except for the villain (who sucks too), are all huge, unlikeable nerds, and you don't care at all about their fates.  They aren't developed as people, just thrust into predictable molds of dialogue and behavior.  As for the technical side, it's non-existent.  We're told that powerful magnets are somehow used to shrink people in a matter of maybe 1.5 pages.  The rest involves the characters trying to outrun one species of bug after another.  The bugs have more time on paper than the technology used to power the whole plot.  Terrible.    I'm not trying to be mean, because God knows, I'm no novelist, but I'm comparing to Crichton's other books, and even Pirate Latitudes, which was awful, is a masterpiece in comparison to this dreck.  I read this book before, when it was a movie called \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,\\" except the movie managed to be entertaining.  Hawaii should sue the Crichton estate for being includedin this crime against literature.  Avoid this travesty.

B005AUWY90|2.0|Pixar has jumped the shark on this film.  It was almost as if we had a completely different company create this movie.  As a parent of a 2 & 4 year old, I was really excited for the sequel but this was over the top with guns and violence.  As a adult I grew tired of the reused spy movie scenes.  The original left off with so much potential for a follow-up in the USA.  Say like the gang visiting family in NY, Sally and Lightning having a baby car who turns out to be a go-carting protege,... ok you get it.  Lastly, I don't see the same discovery my family has had with the original's attention to detail.  Seems like everytime we watch Cars we pick up a new detail in the background which is ingeniously place.

0385738773|3.0|**There are minor SPOILERS in this review**<br />When I reviewed The Scorch Trials (book two in the trilogy), I said I was confident Dashner would tie up the loose ends and answer all our questions in this final book. He didn't. I'm still not sure how I feel about it.<br />For most of The Death Cure, Thomas and his friends running from, fighting with, or trying to escape from either Cranks or WICKED. It felt like one action sequence after another.<br />Like lots of dystopian triologies, the first book lets you learn about the characters and what makes them tick, the second book sets up the final showdown, and then the last book is all about beating the bad guys (hopefully), and answering questions. Except in this book, Thomas decides that he no longer wants the answers he fought for in the previous two books. He's had just enough flashes of memory to know he was deep into WICKED and their evil plans, and he's scared to know what exactly he did. Thomas decides that it's what a person does now that matters, not what they did in the past. While I agree with this, and get the character's logic, it still feels really unsatisfying as a reader to not get the answers you waited through two books to get. I'm not happy with how Teresa's storyline played out, and didn't really see the point in it. Other reviewers have articulated their feelings on these points much better than I can, so I'll mention a few things I did like:<br />I appreciated that the book ended on a hopeful note that the human race wouldn't be annihilated after all. I was a little disappointed that WICKED wasn't defeated by the remaining Gladers and their Group B allies, but I was relieved to know that any remnants or their work would soon be gone thanks to the spreading Flare virus.<br />I was also glad that it didn't appear Thomas and Brenda would be too overcome by PTSD to have a happy future together. That said, it kind of bothered me Thomas never knew that Brenda and Jorge had been planted by Chancellor Page to affect her last-ditch escape plan for the Immune people. It seemed this piece of info was withheld for the sake of another surprise/twist at the end.<br />I did enjoy the redemption of Galley. The Right Arm being fanatics wasn't something I had really considered, but I liked how Thomas and company were ultimately responsible for saving the other Immunes themselves. Their return to the Maze felt like a full-circle moment.<br />The book had short chapters that often ended on mini-cliffhangers, which kept you reading to see what happened next. The nearly non-stop action kind of distracted me from how little character development there was. Overall, it was an OK book.last-ditch escape plan for the Immune people.

We get both Widescreen and Fullscreen versions of the film, (even though the movie was shot fullscreen, it's nice to have a wide picture fit in your widescreen TV.)  Awesome Packaging  And even more Special Features.  I don't see why everyone is complaining, the didn't have to buy it. But since I'm a huge fan, this was a must own.  PS - I never saw anyone else complain about the many DVD editions of Dawn Of The Dead or Halloween.

1451648537|5.0|One of the best books I have read. It gave me the true story as to what made this man so great. He never stopped beliving in himself and his product. I found it to be a very honest history of his life and a story that we all could learn from. A book not to miss reading.
0385738773|4.0|If you liked Hunger Games, you'll like this series.  The final book of the series, the Death Cure wraps up the trilogy neatly.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I wish the picture for the mp3 converted video didn't stay the same from the first video (all the videos I downloaded to mp3s have the picture of the very first video I downloaded) in my music library but its not a deal breaker for me. this does what it claims to do and I am very satisfied since the majority of the songs on my laptop are songs I downloaded from youtube (kindle fire does not come with a usb cord so I have no way of transferring my music.) I had a hard time finding my videos because its in the &quot;gallery&quot; and not &quot;videos&quot;- just a fyi for any kindle fire users.
0439023513|5.0|This book was very good. It was an OK conclusion, but I wished one of the main three (Gale, Peeta, Katniss) died. I also wanted to know more about the \\"new\\" world they lived in. I have to admit, President Coin's death was pretty unexpected, even though Katniss seemed to hate her from the start.
0312430000|5.0|The Checklist Manifesto is a very insightful book, which tells us that how by merely using checklists, one can avoid basic problems. The author has proved it by giving real time examples of people who were benefitted by it. A good checklist can certainly be a very useful management tool to make sure that tasks are done on time and according to their priority. Most important lesson I learned from this book is that the checklist not only tells us what to do, but also what not to do.
0439023521|5.0|As you can probably tell from the title, this book is very fast paced. OK, the beginning was kind of slow, but after the first chapter ends, things start picking up very quickly. I can't say much without revealing the plot content, but just know that if you like action, romance, drama, and futuristic novels, this is a book for you. It also has some sci-fi elements that grow as you know more about Panem, the fictional country they all live in (set in present-day USA). According to the back of the book Stephen King and Stephenie Meyer are both fans of the book, so if you are fans of those people, than this may be a good book to read as well. Every person I have recommended this to have read all three books in the trilogy, and loved it; they could not put the book down. Upon re-reading the book, I have found that I, too, cannot bring myself to do anything else until I finish. The whole idea of The Hunger Games is so creatively conjured, but it has just the right amount of reality. You can't help but wonder if this is what America will amount to in a couple hundred years......
B005DZMODI|3.0|Although I like Clapton and Marsalis, and own a lot of their music, the blend of these two artists' styles didn't work for me.  There was no magic happening.  I gave the CD to a friend.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This film is beautiful, classic, inspiring and heart wrenching. It speaks to morality and inspires me to be more like strong Jane Eyre. <3

B005IGVYUG|5.0|The album is great, the sounds recall the last \\"real gone\\" but probably with some news in the sound (and the piano as well).   The delivery has been in perfect condition.
0307477479|2.0|The main character was not interesting. The narrative was slow. I just could not get into this one and I couldn't finish it. Actually, I am left wondering what was all the fuss about this book!
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is my most favorite Christmas movie ever. It is humurous and makes me feel like a kid again everytime I watch it. Reccomended for all ages =)
159562015X|1.0|I had heard so many positive comments regarding this book and the assessment that I had to purchase it.  Unfortunately, I was really unimpressed. The results were obvious and didn't provide any new reflections or insights.  I was under the impression that the book would confirm or provide specific feedback about career choices and job fit.  However, the suggestions were really vague, e.g., \\"no matter how busy you are, stay in touch with your friends.\\" (p.147) Really?  I was hoping for so much more.  The additional resources online didn't provide much new or valuable information either.
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book for my 20 year old son. He absolutly loved it. He said it was the best book he had ever read!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I've lost count, but I think this is the 6th or 7th case I've purchased for iPhone or iPod, and it's my favorite, possessing only one flaw. I've had thin as paper silicon, I've had hard plastic cases, I've had Otterboxes in a couple varieties. This one is the best.  The pros: Slim, not bulky, good energy absorption, camera area clear, cable connection access easy  The cons: hard to remove  I seem to be all fumble fingers lately, and have dropped my new 4s from 3 or more feet above the ground a lot. So far, not even a scratch on the phone. (I killed an android with such a drop). It does such a good job absorbing the energy of the fall that it even makes a soft sound when it lands. It's easy to get the cables in and out (though 3G earbuds stick a bit) and there is never a problem with the case interfering with either the flash or the lens on the camera.  the only complaint is, if you use your phone with some accessories (certain portable speakers) that use the USB connection, the case might interfere with a good fit. And the case is a pain to get on and off--I'm a little afraid that the very thing strap-connections at the bottom will stretch and/or break if I repeatedly remove it. I don't think I could recommend this case to someone who takes his/her phone out of the case often.  But I leave my review at 5 stars because anyone for whom that is not an issue will find this case a GREAT value.
B00488EQ5K|5.0|This deluxe edition comes with the standard 14 track CD & a bonus CD that includes 3 bonus never heard or released songs, two acoustic songs & the pop mix of Mine. The bonus CD also has enhanced video features of the behind the scenes making of the music video of Mine and the music video is included.<br /><br />I love this album a lot of the songs on the album have some great beats and some very personal value to me.<br /><br />My favorites on the album are the following: Mine, Sparks Fly, Back to December, Speak Now, Mean, The Story of Us, Enchanted, Better than Revenge, Haunted, Long Live, Ours, If This Was a Movie, and Superman.<br /><br />Now I'm gonna give you may own personal reviews on my favorite songs & the songs I really don't know.<br /><br />Mine - This song has a great beat and meaning. It talks about how regardless of your past and what you see love can work as long as you really love the person you are with cause they may be \\"the best thing that's been (mine) yours\\". I give this song a 5 stars because it is just a wonderful song!<br /><br />Sparks Fly - This song is a good song cause I personally know the feeling of the song which is about forbidden feelings. I first heard a live version of this song and the live lyrics were changed for the album but the meaning stayed and I just love the beat and it's way of trying to tell the person this is what I want though I know I can't have it or shouldn't want it. I give this song 5 stars!<br /><br />Back to December - Taylor's personal apology to Taylor Lautner even though people say it's a speculation it is actually true the hidden message in the lyrics is Tay, so of course it means this song is for Taylor Lautner. I like this song cause recently with my own personal relationship I have had my doubts and wondered if this December would be our goodbye and knowing how I truly feel about my partner I would make this song my own personal apology if this every came into fruition. I give this song 5 stars for it's great personal meaning<br /><br />Speak Now - This song has always hit my interest cause it's a unique way to hear Taylor sing, she tries to hit notes that you'd think would be out of her octave range but like most artist she pulls them off beautifully. This song's true meaning is about speaking up before it's too late, it doesn't really have to revolve around speaking up in a church to stop a wedding, Taylor herself admits in the booklet that she's always had this thing about fantasizing over something like this happening and even though in real life no one actually does it doesn't mean you shouldn't even if you don't think it's the right time. This song is Taylor's way of getting to her fans that she believes you should speak up and tell the person how you truly feel. I give this song 5 stars for it's great personal meaning and awesome beat!<br /><br />Dear John - This song has a tendency to make me mad cause my ex-step-dad was named John and he just recently left my mother and had been committing adultery and this song seems to bring out (for me) the anger I held in for many years of dislike of the man. I am not saying it's a bad song, it's just okay to me. I give this song 4 stars.<br /><br />Mean - I just love the way Taylor does this song, this song is a true country song. Where you can tell from the previous songs which have a more popish-country beat this song is straight up country. I love the hand claps the beat and the way you know that if you're just mean to Taylor you're gonna hear her opinion back at you. This song is awesome and amazing! I give this song 5 stars!<br /><br />The Story of Us - I love this song it has it's own uniqueness compared to the previous songs. This song goes back to the popish-country sound but with a great reason. This song is about the incident that took place between Taylor and a guy she was with and saw at the CMT Music Awards (again thanks to the hidden message we know this.) It tells the story of a relationship that is falling into disaster over a \\"simple complication & a miscommunication\\" that led up to the events in the chorus and how even though both of them wanna say what they truly feel both are being too stubborn to do so and so the feeling is that the story of their relationship is gonna end even though this isn't truly what one of them really wanted. I give this song 5 stars.<br /><br />Never Grow Up - This song is about Taylor moving out on her own and leaving her mom & dad & brother into her own home so this song is of course about her own personal feelings on how she felt after she moved out and the things she misses and everything a parent doesn't like about their kids: all parents truly wish their kids would never grow up especially really fast. So this song talks about that as well and how she now understands why her own mother didn't want her to grow up. I give this song 4 stars. I personally don't feel the song and it's beat is really downing and kinda depressing but the song still has a good meaning behind it.<br /><br />Enchanted - I really love the way this song speaks for my own personal feelings cause I've known how it's felt to be enchanted and amazed by a person only to find that they may not feel the same about you. This song talks about how a meeting of fate causes this big personal reaction of feelings and how these feelings can eventually go into doubt and wonder and curiosity cause even though the two have a great time you feel one way and you wonder if the other person feels the same way. That's what this song is about and it really hits home for me and I just love this song and I wanna give a personal thanks to Taylor for this amazing and enchanting song. A BIG 5 STARS for this song!<br /><br />Better Than Revenge - What can I say this song is just amazing. The first time I heard this song I was surprised at some of the things Taylor was saying about this actress and how personal Taylor felt on the situation. I am pretty sure this song would be a great single especially to the women who've had another woman steal their man and they can't find a way of expressing their feelings. Well ladies this song is the one for you. 5 stars for this song cause it's a great way to get back at the cheating bimbos out there.<br /><br />Innocent - I personally don't care for the song nor understand it. It's Taylor's remark to Kanye West and what he did to her at the VMA's, I don't have to recap we all know about it. I personally have not forgiven Kanye for what he did and he obviously doesn't respect that Taylor was willing to forgive him cause from what I've understood his response was nothing less then pleasant. So this song gets my lowest rating from the songs on the album it gets a 3 star.<br /><br />Haunted - You ever have the feeling that you don't understand why your relationship breaks even though you knew it was on the edge and you really never expected it to break and are haunted by the memory of it? This song is exactly about that. I love this song cause I've been down that road before and it does have a lot personal meaning to me. 5 stars cause this is a great song!<br /><br />Last Kiss - This song has a tendency to drown on too long for me. It talks about never believing the relationship would end and spending the rest of your life with the person you never thought you'd have a last kiss with and even though the relationship is over you still wish them the best cause you still love them. That's what Taylor is saying in the song though this song is to Joe Jonas (again thanks to the hidden message in the song which is Forever and Always.) I personally know the feelings but don't like the song cause I've never cared for the Jonas brothers nor care for songs about them. 4 stars.<br /><br />Long Live - This song is a good song even though it's pretty long. It talks about battling through life and standing strong and winning each battle together with the one you love. 4 stars.<br /><br />Ours - This song has a great beat. Ittalks about how no one approves of the love between two people but no matter what the love belongs to both of you and no matter what people say stand by that love. Recently became one of my favorites off the album, I know this songs lyrics so well it's a very personal song for me. 5 stars.<br /><br />If This Was a Movie - Talks about wanting back what isn't coming back though if it was a movie it'd come back. Basically this song is letting people know that the love in movies isn't what happens in real life though that's all we really want. I didn't understand this song until it recently happened to me. I cry now almost every time I hear this song because it's hard to want someone who's not there when you want them so strongly. It's another favorites from the album. 5 stars.<br /><br />Superman - Talks about seeing your love as a Superman and waiting for him and his love. It has a great beat and I know the feeling of this song as well. 5 stars.<br /><br />Back to December (Acousitc) - *Read review for Back to December*. This is a great version of the song it seems to enhance the meaning and the feeling of the song. 5 stars.<br /><br />Haunted (Acoustic) - *Read review for Haunted* This is a great version of the song. It definitely makes you feel the song a lot more then the album version. 5 stars.<br /><br />Mine (POP Mix) - *Read review for Mine* I've always liked the pop mixes of Taylor's songs and this one is no exception. 5 stars.<br /><br />Enhanced Features:<br />\\"On The Set\\" Behind the Scenes \\"Mine\\" Music Video - Split into 3 parts and is really good and funny and a great edition to this deluxe edtion. 5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Mine\\" Music Video - You've all seen it lol.

B004XQO90E|3.0|Despite the incomprehensible sci-fi explanation behind the technology, this was a pretty solid movie up until the last 10 minutes.  The producers chickened out and caved in to the movie studios and focus groups, and tacked on a terrible fairy-tale ending.<br /><br />If it stuck with the existential ending, Source Code would easily be 4+ stars.  Here's hoping we see a Director's Cut.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|My little niece has this really cool wooden castle.  So I thought it would be a perfect fit.  Plus I bought other pieces like it.  She loves them and they are her new favorite toy.  She may only be 4 but I know they won't be a toy she'll out grow.
B004RFYEEC|5.0|I mean you will smile so much that it is such a unique smile it should be called SMiLE. As Josephine Baker once said, at a show I saw on youtube \\"smile... you'll feel better\\" & it's so true! This music is not just \\"another album\\" or \\"more music\\" it is so much better than that; it IS like hearing God's voice (and imo IT IS just like Brain WIlson says) . It heals, it makes you happy, its like classical music mixed with Rock & Roll, its so amazing!   I bought it at Best Buy is why I don't have a verified purchase on my review but let me tell you, I did nab it & you will enjoy it if you do to. I know it's expensive, but if you can afford it, and love The Beach Boys and music overall, you will love this set. I mean, think about it, it's cheaper than some iPods and other electronic devices these days in comparison.  This set is a genuine happy set, when I paid for it, guess what I did, I smiled! This is literally history in the making that we are living in, when this age is long gone, like when the Beatles were new for example, there will be some fans of music who will be all \\"Oh I wish I lived during that time when that album / sessions came out.\\"   Maybe it's my limited vocabulary that I have in describing this album, but really you'll enjoy it!!! I can't stress that enough!  Edit: I just finished listening to the other 4 CDs (after listening to the main 33 vinyls, and I've heard CD 1 many times before) & let me tell you, WOW. There are sounds in there that will blow you away. I will be spinning them again. I've heard the 2nd CD of the little box set too. Now just to spin those 45s - which I've heard digitally CD quality & on the big vinyls already. I also read the big linear book while the music was playing, and learned a lot  about the album. Conclusion: this is \\"THE\\" SMiLE!  BTW - the 33 was of good quality & I will post one last note about the 45s after I spin them. (Probably tomorrow at the local library)  Edit 2: 45s do not disappoint. So cool!

B004LWZW8S|3.0|The visual style of Director Tarsem Singh (\\"The Fall\\") in this cheesy sandal action thriller has been compared to \\"300\\" of a few years ago.  In fact the producers of that film, are prominently mentioned in the various trailers.  The comparison is valid in some respects.  The movie is saturated in sepia tones and coloration as it was to some degree in the aforementioned \\"300.\\"  This film however overloads us with CGI mountains, valleys and cliffs.  I'm no expert in Greek mythology so I'll defer on the accuracy of the gods and their roles in the storyline.  The story as it were, involves King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) wanting to obtain a magic bow that will enable him to kill everybody in Greece and release the Titans who have been captives of the gods for \\"eons.\\"  The gods, led by Zeus (Luke Evans) would like to stop him but can't get involved in human stuff.  Zeus, however can transform himself into a human and does so in the old man body of John Hurt.  The old man discovers the one human that can lead them against Hyperion.  That is Theseus played by Henry Cavill who will be the next Superman and was so good in \\"The Tudors\\" series on the Showtime Network.  Theseus reluctantly leads the Helenics after a chance meeting with Phaedra, the virgin oracle who can see into the future.  She is played by the beautiful Frieda Pinto and her unnamed body double (nude scene).  I thought that once Phaedra lost her virginity her seer ability went with it, but not the case.  The other soldier in this little band is Stavros (Stephen Dorff).  Dorff was award-worthy in a little seen and generally unappreciated movie from 2010 called \\"Somewhere.\\"  His reward is to play comic relief in this blockbuster wannabe.  The movie isn't downright terrible, but it is no \\"300.\\" Those who like the genre will get their fill of blood and gore complete with severed limbs and heads.  Hordes of half naked men flailing swords and spears are pretty much non-stop.  Brain numbing stuff but moderately entertaining.ining.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|I don't have much to say. The book of Gilmorisms isn't included in this one & is just a piece of paper that says to go to some website if I want Gilmorisms. Okay, one: If I want Gilmorisms & I have to go online to find out what is being referenced, I'll Google it. Two: Sigh, when will movie studios stop being lazy with the special features by putting them on some website that will be closed within a year or two of the dvd release? I had this problem with How To Deal. I'm less likely to purchase the first release dvds if I know I'm going to have to wait for the special edition in 5-10 years for deleted scenes.
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Jason Statham clearly is one of the better action stars today.  He's plenty mucho macho and has enough acting chops to stand out.  In this remake of the 1972 Charles Bronson classic (which I don't remember seeing), Statham plays a hired assassin who is at the top of his game.  Unfortunately he is asked to kill his wheel chaired mentor...which he does!  Then he takes the victim's son under his wing and trains him to be a killer also.  Now can you figure out what's coming?  Yeah, it's just a matter of time.  Fortunately getting there is a blast.  This is a terrific film for the genre.
B004FQX5CK|4.0|product arrived on time and works great! The film is much more streamline and timeless.  Masterpiece. A must have for any cinephile.
B004E547D8|3.0|Well I guess if you're going to throw a bunch of older actors into an action film, this is the cast.  Forget about \\"The Expendables\\" and \\"The A Team\\", this is the one for the AARP set.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren and John Malkovich play retired spies who are under fire because they were involved in the extraction of a young agent who went off the grid so to speak when he wiped out a village in South America.  It turns out he is now the Vice President and a tool for a rich arms dealer and financier.  But forget about the plot, this comic book film adaptation is enjoyable to say the least.  As you might expect there are plenty of plot holes and unnecessary \\"booms\\" but for the most part it works.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|i have many problems with my home network, i bought the best linksys router to help me with it, but no improvement, i saw a review about this apps, so i download it, and after 10 min. + - of being playing with it i improve my network considerably, it told me wich channel to use and i move also a little bit my router to the front of the shelf, now i have an average BUT stable signal around my home, Thanks!
B005HS00V4|5.0|Several weeks ago I purchased Gabriel's dual disc which I gave a 5.0 rating (Oct. 29, 2011).  Buying this concert version of the music was a no brainer especially in Blu ray with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 treatment.  I wasn't disappointed.  The concert is long at 162 minutes so there is no cheat on that score.  That's more than double the time on the CD and adds about 7 songs.<br /><br />Gabriel is no slouch on audio and video tricks and often adds some of his own sound effects to the songs.  He also plays around with one of those small cameras that hang from the ceiling.  This goes on too long and too often for my taste.  While in full voice Peter Gabriel is still a strong vibrant singer but in the brief interludes between songs he talks in a near whisper even while the audience is still clapping.  This makes some of the introductions incomprehensible.<br /><br />I can't speak highly enough of the fine \\"New Blood\\" orchestra assembled for this project.  Led by young conductor Ben Foster, they are brilliant.  There are no guitars and no drum kits, but there are 50 or so top notch musicians and are masterfully synched to play the great arrangements by John Metcalfe.  Gabriel has vocal backing by his daughter Melanie who has a few solos within the songs and Ane Brun whose voice sounds a bit frail on her one feature (\\"Don't Give Up\\").  Uzbek singer Sevara Nazarkhan shows up for one song (\\"In Your Eyes\\") as well.<br /><br />The direction that appears on the Blu ray is well done by Blue Leach.  The cameras are well located giving different angles of the singers and the conductor.  Still, it's all about the sound.  The surround versions put you about 15 rows deep in the center.  This is not the Peter Gabriel remembered from the 1980's.  He's more mature and like all artists wants to expand his musical horizons.  He does it here with a bit of new material, a few carefully selected covers and a new approach to his hits.  He doesn't miss.  An excellent concert well worth the money.<br /><br />UPON FURTHER REVIEW:  This was a brilliant stepping stone for Gabriel who seems to satisfy everyone including himself by reinventing the great songs that everyone loves.  Make no mistake, while some of his newer stuff is terrific, the biggies come late in the show (2 ½ hours!) and bring the house down.  Sonically the concert is well presented.  (4-27-12)<br /><br />I can't add much to the above other than to reinforce my appreciation for the technical side of the performance.  Perhaps my recent equipment upgrades help, but the audio is as good as any I've heard.  There are several double bass instruments and some bass drums, a French Horn and a quartet of trombones, so the subwoofers will shake.  Fine direction and an excellent orchestra more than make up for Gabriel's silliness with the hanging camera.  In one instance, he nearly decapitates the conductor.

(4-27-12)    I can't add much to the above other than to reinforce my appreciation for the technical side of the performance.  Perhaps my recent equipment upgrades help, but the audio is as good as any I've heard.  There are several double bass instruments and some bass drums, a French Horn and a quartet of trombones, so the subwoofers will shake.  Fine direction and an excellent orchestra more than make up for Gabriel's silliness with the hanging camera.  In one instance, he nearly decapitates the conductor.  (2-2-15)

0385738773|4.0|Needless to say, The Death Cure is an absolute must read for anyone who read the first two books... but don't expect the same punch the first two carried.  The Death Cure isn't bad, not by a long shot, but it just didn't live up to the brilliance of the first two in terms of suspense or psychological drama.  And, unfortunately, at times it actually becomes repititious and emotionless: the characters lose their spark and the drama becomes overplayed. But it's still an absolute page-turner, and compared to most of the muck out there it's great.  Be aware that The Death Cure should be read immediately following the first two books of the series, as there is little in the way of catch up by the author.  Which is a good thing - there's nothing more tedious than slogging through 20 pages at the start of a sequel to refamiliarize the readers with what had previously happened.   The most frustrating aspect of The Death Cure, as noted by most of the other reviewers, is it's lack of tying up all the loose ends. While The Death Cure will answer most of the major, burning questions, it falls short of doing it's complete job.  And, unfortunately, a great opportunity for creating one giant twist at the end goes unfufilled.  Instead, the reader is left with a somewhat boring and contrived final scene.
0792844890|4.0|Saw the film years ago and thought it was not much. Just saw it again and found it quite good entertainment. Perhaps that is because I have been exposed to some of the 'straight\\" space stuff that had not gotten in my way before; perhap, then I wasn't in the mood for Brooks' distinctive flavor. At any rate, building on my own experience, I would say that any regular viewer of TV space series or some number of theatrical releases in the same genre, who has a taste for Brooks' never subtle comedy, should get a kick out of this. It is not first rate Brooks, but it is good enough for an hour and a half of relief from worry about all those things, in a long running economic slum,p that bother all of us.
0385738765|5.0|My expectations for The Scorch Trials was low - I didn't think the author would be able to pull off the same level of suspense he did with The Maze Runner.  But The Scorch Trials was just as good, if not better, than the first book.  The intrigue and suspense the author manages to build is more than impressive - it's masterful.  I can't recall ever wanting to get to the end of a book so fast to find out the answers.  And when I was done with the book, I got right in my car and drove to Barnes and Nobel to get the final book in the series.    Obviously this type of story isn't for everyone - it's short on dialogue and heavy on action.  The plot can seem silly at times and the suspense overkill.  But for me, it worked in every way.  Be aware that The Scorch Trials starts off exactly where The Maze Runner ends, so it was a little difficult to get right back into the story as it had been several months since I finished The Maze Runner.  But the quick segway was actually very appreciated - there's nothing more tedious than spending the first 20 pages of a sequel repeating what happened in the earlier works.  I would suggest to new readers of the books to get all three, since the third book is now out, so you won't have any lag in recall like I did.

I'd heard all the hype, but I didn't know what the plot was about at all, so it was nice to discover it along the way.

0312641893|4.0|A dystopian cinderella story with cyborgs, androids, the return of the plague, and a kingdom on the moon. This is a really amazing retelling of a fairy tale.   Good points:  *Strong female lead character: Cinder is awesome. She has problems, a lot of problems, and she wishes things were different but she doesn't spend the whole book bemoaning her lot in life. She complains but she moves on, tries to change things, makes plans for the future (acknowledges whether they're realistic or not), etc. She often doesn't realize how much she has going for her, but once she does she owns it and uses it to her advantage. You're rooting for her through the whole story and not once did I drop the book wondering why she was being so stupid (that happens a lot). I also loved that she was a mechanic (I thought making her the best in New Beijing was a bit of a stretch) but it was still and interesting character detail. I liked that she was independent to the point that her step-mother and sisters were actually relying on her for income, though her stepmother especially treated her as little more than a worthless slave.   *Strong side characters: While they were definitely overshadowed by Cinder at times, she was backed by strong side characters that you definitely felt an emotional connection to. There was Peony, her nice stepsister who ended up being infected by the plague. That was just heart-wrenching to read about. And Iko, her outdated pretty much unwanted by anyone else android who had an interesting personality and liked pretty things, tried to make Cinder laugh, etc.   *Fascinating villain. Queen Levana of Luna. I don't want to give too much away but wow. Psychotic (and what a family history!), extraordinarily vain, manipulative, and power-hungry. She's like a nasty little viper.   *Interesting details about the \\"future\\". Cyborgs, androids, ID chips, that people on Luna had \\"evolved\\", etc. Nothing too unique or groundbreaking, but all elements that made the story a more interesting read.   Bad Points:   *Predictable. The second Princess Selene is mentioned I knew what was going on and I imagine most readers will make this connection. It's fairly obvious. And a few other major plot elements aren't a big mystery.  *Unresolved questions that may or may not be dealt with by the sequels. How is she a mechanic? As a cyborg, it would be nice if she could do her own repairs, especially with a stepmother who would prefer she rust, but who taught her? Did Garan teach her? Did Adri make sure she learn so that both she wouldn't have to pay for any repairs and she could make money off the girl? Was it part of her programming? It's possible I may have simply missed this I suppose, but there are other such questions.   *As the first book in a series the cliffhanger at the end shouldn't come as a surprise, but I wish it had been a bit more wrapped up than it was. Instead you're kind of left floundering a bit hoping the sequel will come along in time to throw you back in the water.   I couldn't put this book down, I read through it within a few hours. I was so absorbed I almost missed my bus stop on the way home. :) I highly recommend this, it was very worth the read. I did take off a star for the predictability and a few lost details, but wow. Story-wise alone I would give it a full five. Excellently done.

There is LESS violence in this 90 min movie than in a 10 minute \\"tom & jerry\\" or most tv cartoons today.<br />OK, there is a lot of explosions and such, but still; it is cars blowing up, not humanlike characters smashing each other with frying pans.<br />Great family fun, minimal violence, no cursing (unless you count \\"day-gum\\"),<br />Hilarious, action packed, great computer graphics.<br /><br />And as so eloquently described in other reviews, this is a \\"James Bond\\" adventure.

Because, Jay said himself in an interview that Eminem is his competition. So picture a Duo-version of Renegade from 2001. Yeah, exactly.

B000AAF1U4|5.0|After the Disney animation renaissance of the late 80's early 90's the Disney magic began to wane when the classic formula started wearing thin. Disney decided to respond to dwindling box office receipts by experimenting with some non formulaic animated feature films. Gone were the musical numbers, the cute sidekick(s) and the prince/princess love story. Audiences thanked Disney's bold move by expressing tremendous disinterest. The Emperor's New Groove lost money domestically although the similarly well produced and edgy Lilo & Stitch did decently well. Sadly, after a string of disappointments and the rise of Pixar and Dreamworks Animation, Disney decided to pull the plug on hand drawn animation. The modest success of The Princess and the Frog has put hand drawn animation back on life support but we may be in the final years.<br /><br />If I were to speculate I would guess that much of the failure of The Emperor's New Groove is unrelated to the quality of the movie. First of all the title is somewhat confusing and it seemed like the advertisers didn't know how to market it. The poster of Emperor Kuzco with a big cheese eating grin and the giant letters ME just doesn't draw me in. It's really a shame because this is one of the most enjoyable Disney animations I've seen. The art is bright, bold and clean enough to eat off of. The writing is legitimately laugh out loud funny with all sorts of self referential and physical humor. What really sets Groove apart from the rest of the Disney animation library is the characters. I loved the fact that Kuzco was such an unrepentant jerk through most of the film. You can't help but feel that the movie villains, Yzma and Kronk, are completely justified in poisoning him. Eartha Kitt is wonderful as Yzma but the standout star is Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld) as the simple minded Kronk. David Spade's smarmy voice is a perfect match for Kuzco although for me I just couldn't seem to separate the voice from the actor and I kept seeing Kuzco as Spade. I had the same issue John Goodman as Pacha. Even when James Woods lent his distinctive voice to Hades I bought it but for some reason I couldn't help but imagine Spade and Goodman in soundproof booths talking into microphones.<br /><br />The Emperor's New Groove had a massive script rewrite, lost its director, had almost all its songs pulled and was nearly shut down by Michael Eisner and the end product was far better than should ever have been expected. This really is a movie that's suitable for children of all ages. It's arguably the most lighthearted of all the Disney animated features and definitely one of the most humorous and there are NO sassy sidekicks. There are some Disney movies I watch and some I want to own and Groove definitely falls into the \\"own\\" category because it's so rewatchable.<br /><br />I was an early admirer of computer animation and was watching Pixar shorts years before Toy Story arrived in theaters in 1995. Having said that I think it's tragic that hand drawn animation is nearly completely dead in the United States. As stunning as computer generated animation is I often find it to be same old same old. I'm reminded of when Capcom tried to move the Street Fighter franchise into 3D. It just didn't look right and I felt that the sprite based fighters had a much more artistic feel to them. That's not to say that I think Soul Caliber should switch to sprites but I'd like to think there's room in the world for both and I'd like to think there's room for Shrek and The Emperor's New Groove.pt seeing Kuzco as Spade.

B001TH16DI|4.0|I bought this for just 40 dollars, so it is 6.66 per movie. It is well worth it - so much entertainment for so little money. I just wanted to check if the discs work, but then TMP caught me. I was never able to really embrace the first movie - however, remastered and in fullHD, it is such a great experience! So far ST6 used to be my favorite movie, but I am not so sure now. I never liked ST3 and fullHD is not going to change that. However, this is a must for every fan.  The only downside - it is not the directors edition.
B005C5A6C0|4.0|4 1/2 years after the Blackening, a new album comes out. I wasn't expecting The Blackening pt.2, I was expecting something more than this, length and song wise. After listening to this album several times the songs sound good, but to me it feels like the 7 songs recorded just aren't enough. After my 1st play through of the album the drumroll and violin faded out from the last song I was thinking to myself \\"that's it?\\" Maybe 2 or even 3 more songs would make this album feel complete. The 2 bonus cover songs (Judas Priest & Rush) are nothing special. I'd still recommend it if someone asked.
B0012GMW7A|3.0|Great songs on this album.  It would have been enhanced had Jennifer Warnes sung more prominently.  It is well known that Leonard Cohen's voice is uninteresting at best.  Jennifer Warnes, however, is a wonderful interpreter of music as her later albums, \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\" and \\"The Hunter\\" demonstrate so aptly.  The promise of this album was in the collaboration with Ms. Warnes.  It has too little of her great voice.

1609611543|5.0|I picked this up the first week it came out just because it caught my attention. I like to read about health and fitness and this book will open your eyes so much and let you know just how misled we as a majority are by the generally accepted conventional knowledge. I know it sounds crazy at first since we've been told that \\"eat healthy whole grains\\" has been the mantra for the last few decades, but it really is legit.
0143105035|5.0|I recently read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for the first time, then realized I had never read Frankenstein either. I bought it awhile ago and finally got around to reading it. Its a deserved classic, and there are some great things about this book and some disappointing things, all unexpected.<br /><br />Some of things I was surprised by include the story itself. Very involved in literary history, quotes many authors. Frankenstein's monster is a sympathetic creation in a lot of ways. By the end of part 2, where the monster tells his own story, you start to feel sorry for him. Great story that casts light on sin, humanity, religion, and what life is. It is not a book that will really scare you, but it will make you think.<br /><br />Some things I was disappointed in include the coincidences that occur. A story written like this today would never work . . . but it was fine for its era. The monster finding Victor's home based on some loose directions overheard from a French family is at best a stretch. The book drags in a few places as well for modern readers, but you are rewarded for pushing through it.<br /><br />All in all, a well deserved classic that is a worthy read. The fact that Mary Shelley wrote this at 19 is astounding and humbling. Note that this is NOT a comic book. It has an illustrated cover, no graphics inside. Another review made it sound like it was a comic book.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
B005LAIGFA|2.0|The magic of films and stage plays is that the audience suspends its belief system for two hours and pretends that it is observing reality. Yet part of the brain knows it is participating in make believe -- otherwise we would be psychotic. This suspension of disbelief is not automatic, however. The responsibility of the medium is to present its subject matter with as much realism as possible to assist the viewer's imagination. So a film that takes place in the 1930s will have old cars and old clothing, etc., to lend authenticity and facilitate the suspension of disbelief. The job of the actors is to perform their craft with such transparency that the audience can believe in the authenticity of the characters. Spencer Tracy, when asked for his definition of good acting, replied, \\"Never let them catch you doing it.\\"<br /><br />My beef with J. Edgar is that Leonardo DiCaprio with globs of make-up does not J. Edgar Hoover make. And I wonder: Why do some of Hollywood's best directors make this same mistake? In The Aviator, superb director Martin Scorsese asked my imagination to accept this same Leonardo as Howard Hughes. I have enjoyed DiCaprio in a number of lighter roles (e.g., he was fine in Titanic) but as Hughes? Not a chance. Incredible miscasting, Mr. Scorsese, shame on you. And shame on Clint Eastwood, who has turned in so many wonderful films, for slinging a ton of make-up on this boyish actor and asking him to inhabit the skin of a character who is as un-boyish as you can get, namely Hoover. The result is a film that lacks a credible center.<br /><br />Instead of portraying Mr. Hoover as the monster that he was, J. Edgar is a film about a momma's boy who is a paranoid clown. Eastwood attempts to dramatize important events in the history of the FBI and what he delivers is light comedy. A good example is Eastwood's treatment of the homosexual relationship between Hoover and his aide, Clyde Tolson: The two men are alone in a hotel suite. Hoover admits having had an affair with Dorothy Lamour (the thought of which is hilarious in its own right) and he and Tolson wind up on the floor in a mock fight that is reminiscent of the Three Stooges. Another example is Hoover's penchant for firing anyone who tries to upstage him, which becomes nothing more than a silly motif. In another scene, Eleanor Roosevelt is exposed for having an affair with a woman. This kind of intrusion into the private lives of individuals, an example of Hoover's vindictiveness, made me laugh instead of feeling disgust for Hoover.<br /><br />Much of the film is delivered in flash-back. Unfortunately Mr. DiCaprio's acting as a young Hoover is the same as his acting as an older Hoover with the exception of the make-up. His side-kick Tolson fares even worse in this regard. His make-up is a left-over from a Mummy film. At one point, Tolson faints and Hoover shouts, \\"Get a doctor!\\" I turned to the person sitting next to me and said, \\"Get a make-up artist!\\" In terms of Hoover's character and what made him tick, I learned nothing from this screenplay except for a few broad strokes, e.g., Hoover's obsession with his mother. The intense, dangerous bulldog that I think of when I conjure up a portrait of J. Edgar Hoover was nowhere to be found.<br /><br />On top of all this, the pacing of the film is geriatric. My friend kept falling asleep and I had to nudge her several times. The one aspect that kept me awake was the story of the Lindbergh kidnapping, which should have been the subject of the film rather than this shallow look at a complex public figure.y Lamour (the thought of which is hilarious in its own right) and he and Tolson wind up on the floor in a mock fight that is reminiscent of the Three Stooges.

0545123275|5.0|As soon as I read the first short chapter I was hooked. I love how this author writes. This story is about a girl who is in love were a wolf. A werewolf, but there are no moons involved. The wolves are human during summer and wolves during winter. Their winters are counted though until one year they stay a wold forever. Grace tries to find a way to stay with the wolf/boy that she has loved since she was little. How to keep a boy from changing back into a wolf? Read to find out. It is a very sad story and I found myself tearing up at some points. Read to enjoy!
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|After seeing Something Borrowed on shelves many times, and seeing previews for the upcoming movie I broke down and bought it.  In spite of staying up until the wee hours of the morning to finish it, I have to say I didn't love it.  I had little genuine sympathy for the characters.  I couldn't imagine how I was going to have any sympathy for Darcy in the sequel.  Surprisingly, Emily Giffin creates a much more likeable, relateable character in Darcy.  We see a genuine relationship develop between her and Darcy and instead of seeing someone become more corrupt, we see Darcy learning how to look beyond herself.  Altogether, a good read.

Other then that, nothing caught my attention of this book. The separation of Grace and Sam was sad. Their whole relationship is sad. I can't wait to read the third and last book to find out how it ends!

Just when you built a relationship with the characters, the story ends. Overall it was a good book. I liked the perspective of the crazy drunk husband. Best part of the book.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Love the music, came as a recomendation and it was right on. I would recomend this cd to anyone who likes different music.
0553386794|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to start the next one. The only thing is that this book took up way too much of my time. I don't know if I have all of a sudden become a slow reader, but if any book takes over 15 days to read, there must be a problem. Almost a month it took me! Unbelievable! I am ashamed with myself. There were many characters but they were easily distinguishable. I loved every moment of reading. Daenerys was my favourite. Loved the knights, the war, the blood and the lust. Will take a break until the next one though.<br />I read in occurance to the series on TV:<br />Episode 1: Pages 0 - 108<br />Episode 2&3: Pages 109 - 236<br />Episode 4: Pages 237 - 304<br />Episode 5: Pages 305 - 384<br />Episode 6: Pages 385 - 500<br />Episode 7: Pages 501 - 594<br />Episode 8: Pages 595 - 674<br />Episode 9: Pages 675 - 728<br />Episode 10: Pages 729 - 807
B00479SVBU|5.0|Started using this item as soon as it arrived . I haven't had any problem so far with it. It actually delivers better sound output than I had expected, considering that I have similar functions from my cell phone. I have been a HAPPY driver since the use . I can \\"carry\\" all my favorite artists along with me without thinking of cluttering the car. Really glad that I bought it. You would also !
0545259088|4.0|As I said in the last review I wrote in Linger; Shiver was the best. They could have gotten away with just the one book, or at least 2 better written books. I liked Forever but I think it was a bit too long. I liked the relationship complications between Isabel and Cole. I wish Grace and Sam were more passionate with each other but I can see why the writer didn't write it that way. Their relationship wasn't based on words or actions. I was waiting for the end of Shelby and I wish the writer wrote Shelby's demise better. The ending was left open. Way open! I wish I knew how it ended. Was Grace cured? Did Cole and Isabel end up together? So many questions. A fourth book? Who knows!
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Muy buena calidad en BLU-RAY, es una de mis peliculas favoritas.<br />El audio impecable y aunque la presentacion es basica en cajita azul, la pelicula es de primera.
0446618322|4.0|Nicholas Sparks has a talent in bringing you so close with the characters, it is as if you know them deeply. You become part of their little family. I found myself eager to find out what the outcome of the book would be. Loved the ending. It was sweet and worth the read :)
B005MQW5RI|5.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />There are about 173 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 22 made it to 15%, 19 out to 20%, 36 more at 25% and 2, 30-35%. That's a lot of OOS effects. In addition there are quite a few quick 25-40% effects piled near the title scenes but the 3D in them is a somewhat flawed. However, very few 3D flaws elsewhere in this film. I would have to say my favorite effect is the baby juggling / drooling sequence around 30% approximately 10 minutes into the film.<br /><br />This movie earned a 4 way tie for the # 2 position on my shelf. For 3D quality and humor, it ranks right up there with the 3 other animated greats, Open Season, Rio and Ice Age.<br /><br />***  Another Must see  ***<br />***  Add it to your list  ***<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = EXCELLENT  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing.

0312360258|3.0|Not my favourite. It's changed the whole `turning vampire' process. I don't know if I liked that too much. The thought and concept was all there. There were interesting scenarios, and I liked the way she had her own little thoughts added in there. It was kind of childish. But she is 16 years old, so I guess I shouldn't complain. It took me so long to read because I wasn't drawn to figure out what happens next. I bought the box set, so onto number two now!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|I received the CD of \\"A New Journey\\" before the date expected. I'm very happy with the condition it is in.
1439102813|4.0|I teared up in some parts. If you have a heart, you will tear up as well. You are proud in some parts and just sadened in others. It was a sad and sweet book. I didn't like it too much - not because it was a bad book or anything - it's just that it was too real for me. This i the hard truth about Alzeimers. Scary stuff.
1593082800|4.0|One of the classics - a very \\"Victorian\\" mystery - and spell binding.  If you enjoy Victorian novels, get this one.  The movie is not nearly as good and does not follow the book - so read the book first!
0743298039|4.0|I loved the way she wrote. Everything was described perfectly. I found myself very interested in the story. Some things were confusing but I got them in the end. If you do choose to read this story and you are confused, come to me and I will answer your questions. Overall good book!
B00632HWOG|2.0|I don't know if it because it is on the Kindle Fire or what, but why cant I read more than one page of emails.  Good start, but needs work to be more User friendly.
1250004217|5.0|I knew this was going to be a great book just from the first chapter. It moves from regular date to 1942. It is in the perspective of an older woman whose family is somehow tied with a little girl who was captured in the Jewish roundup of the Holocaust. The real term was the roundup Vel' d'Hiv. I almost cried with every chapter I read. I would definitely recommend this book. It gives you an insight on things people like to forget. Great book!
B005KN5AES|5.0|The classic Thundersteel line up  returns and delivers a triumphant new album. No disappoint here kids-This album is fantastic! Mark Reale (guitar) is a true craftsman, his guitar playing and composition just keep getting better. After seeing Riot open for Nazareth at Market Square Arena Indianapolis Indiana in 1981, I was hooked. Now let there be no ambiguity here Gentlemen I LOVE RIOT However, in all candor my favorite line up is featured here. Singer Tony Moore still has his range and sounds lethal (in case you were wondering) The mix is great, the mastering is great. I even like the graphics. Fans of metal, power metal, will absolutely love this album.  It is not \\"slow\\" it is not \\"mellow\\" it flat out rocks. Pass it up at your own peril. it's as good as Thundersteel trust me... REST IN PEACE MARK (what a wonderful man) and thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br /><br />(OLGA made \\"Authentic Mexican Tacos\\" for dinner yum)
B0015DRPJU|5.0|This book, which is the third, was even better than the first two books combined. I can't believe how awesome it began and ended. There was even a battle scene in this book which had me hanging onto every word. The love scenes melted my heart and I even almost cried at the heartbreak at the end. I need to buy the next book! (btw, the Russian covers for these books are so much better than the American ones. I don't know why they changed them. Oh well.)
0060873027|1.0|**** SPOILERS AHEAD ****  3 Other titles I considered for my review were:  1. POSSIBLY THE WORST BOOK EVER PUBLISHED BY A RESPECTED AUTHOR.  2. BREAKING NEWS: RECENT SEISMIC ACTIVITY FOUND TO BE DECEASED AUTHOR MICHAEL CRICHTON ACTUALLY SPINNING IN HIS GRAVE.  3. REALLY????  I like Michael Crichton. I've read all his fiction, including many years ago tracking down all the paperbacks he wrote under a pseudonym. So I picked up Micro, getting ready to enjoy my last new Crichton novel. The end of an enjoyable era. I prepare myself for the intelligent work that I have gotten used to for decades.   Shortly into the book I realise that this is what it is about: A mad scientist has isolated 7 graduate students in Hawaii and shrunk them to 1/2\\" tall.   I must be joking, right? I wish I was. Well, surely this is done in an intelligent manner worthy of Michael Crichton's name? No, sorry. It is done in a manner worthy of a 1970's TV movie aimed at 12 year olds. The main characters are 2 dimensional and cliched in every way. When they realise that they have been shrunk they seem to take it pretty well, in the manner of all character's in a Rick Moranis movie, and get ready to use their individual skills to battle snakes, insects, etc., battle the mad scientist, and somehow find out how to get back to their rightful big-person size.  I've never said this before about a book: This is so bad that it's good! I confess that I have only read less than half of the book so far. Normally in a book this deficient I would stop here, but not this time. Will some of the little folk get eaten by a squirrel and make their way through his digestive system to finally defeat the evil genius? Perhaps. But I feel confident that they will surely battle some giant (relatively speaking of course) beetles since one of the students is a beetle expert. I wouldn't miss that!  This book is an excellent reminder that the publishing industry is about 1 thing: $$$$ - People making a living on the Crichton name. I don't blame them. You have to feed your family.   I put this book on the shelf with other books in my Crichton collection. In the night the other books (including the cheesy John Lange books) rejected Micro and spat it out on the floor with the book open and the pages bent.   Not really; I got it from the library. My joy at picking up the book will only be exceeded by my joy in giving it back.
1416550534|4.0|Okay. Where to begin? This book was too long. I found myself bored at the beginning and middle of the book. I expected more from Kate, but that's alright. It took me so long to read since I didn't bother to pick it up. Nothing pulled me. The book was filled with unneeded filler. It pulls you into the characters lives, but a bit too much! Loved the characters though! I loved the secret affair. That was fun. The ending was amazing as well. It is an overall sad book. Read if you must, but don't say I was the one to recommend it. That's all.
B000002P6R|5.0|English rockers The Who released its ninth studio album Face Dances in March of 1981.<br />Following the death of original Who drummer Keith Moon, the rest of The Who (lead singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and bass player John Entwistle) finished the movies and soundtracks to The Who's biopic The Kids Are Alright and Quadrophenia. Then the band decided to forge ahead and hired ex-Faces drummer Kenney Jonnes as their new drummer and went back on the road in 1979/80 (more remembered for the Cincinatti tragedy where 11 fans were trampled to death before The Who hit the stage). Then in 1980, Townshend issued his excellent Empty Glass solo album (despite the fact that he was fighting a bad cocaine and heroin addiction), Entwistle (who too was partying hard and recording his last proper studio solo album in his life Too Late the Hero) and Jones saw their marriages fall apart. Daltrey (on the other hand) starred in the movie McVicar (based on the 1960s London armed robber) and he also released the film's soundtrack as his fourth solo album which was his best solo album (The Who played on it and the songs are just great) and he became a father again as his wife gave birth to son Jamie.<br />The recording for Face Dances would be at London's Odyssey Studios throughout 1980 with mixing at Bayshore Recording Studios in Coconut Grove, Florida with producer Bill Szymczyk (famed for his work with The Eagles, Joe Walsh, J Geils and Bob Seger) and his assistant Allan Blazek engineering. This was also The Who's first album with Warner Bros Records for the US and Canada after a decade plus with MCA (they stayed with Polydor outside the States and Canada). When Face Dances came out, would The Who deliver at a time of New Wave, corporate rock, metal and the dying embers of disco. Read ahead and find out (as I did when I first got the cassette in March of 1987 (the Warner Bros issue) and then CD in January, 1992 then remixed CD in June, 1997).<br />We kick off with the album's first single and big Top 20 and #1 Album Rock Track hit out of \\"You Better You Bet\\" which was one of The Who's best rockers and still a great song today and an early MTV staple. Next is Pete's melodic 12-string guitar number \\"Dont Let Go the Coat\\" which would be another MTV staple and was a single but tanked on the pop charts. Next is the rocker \\"Cache Cache\\" which has fiery vocals from Roger, Jones' excellent drumming, rumbling bass from The Ox and Pete's power chords. This track features Roger's voice tinged with phase and delay on the verses and then reduced to clean for the choruses. Next is a John Entwistle sung number out of the rocker \\"The Quiet One\\". The Ox steps out on lead vocal and this piece just rocks. We end the first side with \\"Did You Steal My Money\\" which was a nice track. Roger is on vocal, Pete on guitars and bass harmonica and singing the bridge and the \\"did you steal my money\\" bits on the intro and outro.<br />The album's second side begins with \\"How Can You Do It Alone\\" which was Pete's epic about three different stories condensed into one five plus minute track with the chorus riff (the eyes full of shame section and the bridge) in a slow pace and the verses (and outro \\"how can you do it\\" part) in a snappy, faster tempo. Next is \\"Daily Records\\" and is another one of Townshend's odes to songwriting and Roger sings very passionately here and brilliant solo from Pete (who sounds like Lindsey Buckingham on his solo with the fingerpicking style). The heavy hard rocker \\"You\\" is next and was written by Entwistle and features Roger singing as if he was angry at an ex-lover. It features superb guitar from Townshend and The Ox's superb 8-string bass playing and his harmony vocals with Daltrey on the choruses. The album's closer is the second big Album Rock Track hit out of \\"Another Tricky Day\\" (also an early MTV staple). This track is one of the best Who album closers and Daltrey sings brilliantly and Pete's guitar was excellent here.<br />The FaceDances album peaked at #4 in the US (only kept from #1 by fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Steve Winwood's Arc of a Diver at #3, REO Speedwagon's Hi Infidelity at #2 and Styx's Paradise Theater was #1 in the States (all of the aforementioned are great albums) and that sure as Hell made people forget about the time that the soundtrack to Grease kept Who Are You out of #1 three years earlier).<br />In 1997, the album was re-released in a remixed and remastered version. First is Pete's rocker \\"I Like Nightmares\\" which was recorded by The Who with Pete on vocal but left off the original album. Next is the rocker \\"It's In You\\" which is sung by Roger. Then it's Pete's original version of \\"Somebody Saved Me\\" with Pete on lead vocals and guitars, John Entwistle on bass and Kenney Jones on drums. The song was worked for the album but scrapped and would be reworked for his 1982 All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes album. The final two bonus tracks are an embryonic jam of \\"How Can You Do It Alone\\" (from 1979) and a live reading of \\"The Quiet One\\" from Shea Stadium in October of 1982. I love the original mix but the remix is just as good (the drums weren't compressed nor any of what Genesis did with their catalog overhaul) and Bob Ludwig's remastering on the 1997 version is excellent but hard to top what Ted Jensen (another great mastering engineer) did on the original vinyl album.<br />RECOMMENDED!eaked at #4 in the US (only kept from #1 by fellow Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Steve Winwood's Arc of a Diver at #3, REO Speedwagon's Hi Infidelity at #2 and Styx's Paradise Theater was #1 in the States (all of the aforementioned are great albums) and that sure as Hell made people forget about the time that the soundtrack to Grease kept Who Are You out of #1 three years earlier).

0061122416|5.0|This was a book that makes you really think. I liked it because it was straight to the point. It made me not want to put it down. Its a life lesson in a few pages in a book. A must read if your lookig for something short
1451648537|3.0|A good biography reads like a novel.  In addition, it delves deep to provide personal details that make the subject come alive in the mind of the reader.  Examples of good biographies readily come to mind:  McCoullough's biography of John Adams, Sheaffer's biography of Eugene O'Neill, the first volume of Morris' biography of Teddy Roosevelt, Dwyer's biography of Napoleon.<br /><br />Sadly, Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs reads more like a People Magazine article than a novel.  Part of the problem is that Isaacson apparently rushed his research owing to Jobs' ill health.  Consider that Sheaffer spent 16 years researching his two books on O'Neill; if memory serves, Morris spent about 10 years researching the first volume of his biography of Roosevelt and an equal amount of time researching the second volume.  The result is that Isaacson's portrait of Jobs is one-dimesional.  Isaacson's account of how Jobs met his wife consists of merely a few paragraphs, and his description of her is so pedestrian that she is hard to differentiate from Jobs' other romantic partners. Although Oracle founder Larry Ellison is described as Jobs' best friend, we learn nothing about how that friendship developed or what role it played in Jobs' life.  Isaacson writes that Jobs was \\"complex,\\" but he fails to show that complexity.  Instead, we are offered repeated stock images of Jobs crying and being charming one moment and distant the next.  At no point does Isaacson offer any insight into Jobs' motivations or personality; instead, he takes the sophomoric shortcut and attributes everything to Jobs being adopted.  Equally problematic from my perspective, however, is that Isaacson just isn't a good writer.  The language is flat, dull, BORING, and fails to rise to the level even of a \\"good turn of phrase.\\"  Given the influence Jobs had on so many facets of modern life, his story deserved better.
0316098329|5.0|It annoyed me at first since it was from a 5 year old's perspective, but then it grows on you. I couldn't believe someone dared to write in depth like that. Room was a book I would probably read over. I would like to know more on what happened with Jack, but I know there will be no part 2. You become so interested in the main characters life. Bye-Bye Room.

0316077046|3.0|I just wanted to figure out how it would end. There were some pretty exciting parts and I pictured the entire thing in my mind. Great visual book. It could have been shorter though. Very Repetitive!!! I hated the ending! Another cliffhanger. It is alright. I will wait patiently for the next book to come out, which I will purchase ! :)
159448385X|5.0|It has been a long while since I have been so captivated by a book. I read it this past Saturday and Sunday, literally in two days. By the last chapter I had a lump in my throat. Very vivid and descriptive. I could visualize each character, feel for them, laugh with them. I truly wanted more... still do. This is my very first book from this author. I have just started reading the Kite Runner. This book has touched me. It pains me to know what women, children and families suffer through in other countries and other parts the world. Some parts were painful, but worth the read. I thank the author for producing such a lovely story.
B000000XBC|5.0|A great album - has like a rock-country taste to it - exceptionally well done.  Get's one singing and shaking when you listen to it.  Everything went well from arrival to purchase and seller.  BUY IT NOW!!!
B003VS0CWY|3.0|After reading other reviews that said you could see individual blades of grass on the Blu-ray version, I decided to purchase this.  I have a 55 inch Sony HD TV that has an excellent picture.  Playing this in a Sony Blu-ray player, connected by HDMI, I expected to have a crisp picture also.  Sadly disappointed.  Maybe it would be all right on a 42\\" screen but on a 55\\" screen the picture is very grainy.

0446310786|4.0|The book was in good condition, the only problem that I had was that the cover of the book in the picture did not match the actual book. That threw me off a bit and I was a little disappointed about that. The book was in good condition so overall I would say I was satisfied.
0425241505|5.0|This book was fantastic! Sexy, sarcastic, with a strong heroine and strong hero who I felt stayed true to themselves and their \\"other\\" natures and didn't flip flop around to suit the plot. The secondary characters were great too, with the exception of the rather lame big bad, and I look forward to reading more about them in the future books. I was never bored or annoyed and even went so far as to read the snippet about Trick's upcoming book and I never do that. Because I have no complaints or b*tchery I'm giving this one a five but it's really a 4 1/2.
6305657947|5.0|This is a terrific story about love for those whom are unsure of love.. And that happen to have money! Main cast did a wonderful job of keeping me guessing right until the end.. Absolutely wonderful..
1441748628|4.0|I read this on audio. I am stressed and lazy so this going to be a spewing of things that are rattling around in my head rather than another rehashing of the plot. The same narrator reads this novel who read the 1st one and manages to make Bones sound like a cartoon character. It has grown on me and I like it ;) I also liked the humor, the chemistry, and many of the new characters with the exception of the bland Noah and the team member secretly crushing on Cat (his name has already escaped me). I didn't like the fact that four years had passed (that threw me for a bit), I was annoyed again that Cat still puts up with crap from her mom who I hate with an intensity normally reserved for people who hate dogs and that rude guy who was crushing on Cat and accusing her of terrible things. She should've stabbed him with a stake and put him out of his misery early on. The non-vanilla love scenes that caused such a stir was a bit  boring to me.  Seriously, I don't know what that says about me.  That also goes for most of the rest of the overblown sex. Maybe I'm just burned out but it just seemed so over-the-top \\"ooooh, ahhhh, bite me again, harder, never stop\\" blah, blah, blah . . . I started to tune it out.  Still, a Cat and Bones book is still leagues above a lot of the other PNR stuff out there.
B0068TJLSY|1.0|This is pure garbage. The plot is ridiculous, and the dialog is really banal and laughable. After the train crash, which is very impressive, this movie takes a downturn to the level of a B movie turd. I wish I could get my money back, but at least I did not buy this stinkbomb!
B0009S4IKQ|1.0|Sorry. This may be deemed a classic but I just couldn't get into it. Perhaps it is because it is the early days of movies. I think they sped up the reel so fast that it made people seem as if they were talking fast. Or maybe they were not acting but just reciting lines. I have no idea. But I can't understand people during this era. And the men . . . they seem too painted up . . . too . . . dracula like or something. I dunno. Not my cup of tea.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I cried a lot and laughed a lot.  One reviewer said that he shouldn't have read this because all these good ratings are from \\"customers\\" and not real critics.  So you folks who want to know, I am NOT a professional reviewer but I know what I like and I really liked this book.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Fun game. I purchased the full version. Works great on the Kindle Fire. I like having the abiliity to enlarge the tiles so you can see them better which is nice for older eyes. I would definitely buy to install on Grandma's Kindle Fire.
1451627289|5.0|King's latest novel does dive head first into the subject of time travel, but it's everything else he can do with the characters that makes it even more worthwhile.  I enjoyed his take on traveling back in time.  This novel is long, and seems to put off some readers by it's sheer length, but where some found it windy or slow, I found it simply added to the overall adventure of Jake...and George as well.  The heroes are fantastic, the villians are every bit as hideous and low, and the execution of making a journey like this is well paced.  King doesn't pull any punches, showing not just the positive and negative sides of traveling back, but also how this period of American History was not all Norman Rockwell, but not all Doom and Gloom either.  As someone who grew up in a small town, I loved the credit he gave to what it's like to grow up in a small community.  As someone who has visited Dealy Plaza and the 6th floor museum twice in the past decade, I was thrilled to see the detail of the place and the area surrounding it, as it's not necessarily something you could do by simply googling different maps and such.  Just being able to give that part of town it's ominous overlay, as it has been something of it's own dark personality because of the happenings there so long ago, made it better than most who may try to attempt such a story.  The novel is so much more, as many have noted, than trying to stop LHO in the Book Depository building.  The friends he makes along the way, on both sides, as well as the Yellow Card Man, help power this story with some of the better character development he's done in some time.  King's own take on the time travel genre is genuine and intellectual.  Whether you are old or new to King, this novel is worth reading.  It stands alone, with the exception of a reunion with a particular town that I won't spoil here.    DW  11/28/11
B0050AV5MW|1.0|I dragged myself through 5 books of this rubbish, hoping, begging for something to happen. But I just wasted 2 months I won't get back. After 5 books still NOTHING is resolved.   George Martin should honestly stick to TV. The book is written like a 2nd rate day time soapy, every chapter is a waffle of useless information and repeats like we forgot the entire book in an ad break, and every chapter, without fail, ends on a cliff hanger. It's just irritating.  With the exception of book 1, 3 and book 5 nothing happens, ever. And all that \\"happens\\" are just more cliff hangers, but they're the only ones of any worth.  Don't read it, seriously, watch the TV series enjoy it, and know you'll have to wait till the last episode of the 7th season to actually learn anything.  In fact, I highly recommend George abandons he last 2 books, rather let him write them as scripts and let someone else transcribe the TV series into a book.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|We enjoyed the videos but were a little disappointed in the picture quality. Other BluRay's we have - even oldies like Gone With the Wind - are pristine compared to this one. Also, I thought it was going to be the original release, but at least one scene was quite different.

And all that \\"happens\\" are just more cliff hangers, but they're the only ones of any worth.<br /><br />Don't read it, seriously, watch the TV series enjoy it, and know you'll have to wait till the last episode of the 7th season to actually learn anything.<br /><br />In fact, I highly recommend George abandons he last 2 books, rather let him write them as scripts and let someone else transcribe the TV series into a book.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|If you don't own any of the Harry Potter movies and don't care about any extras and extended version, i would recommend this set. BUT if you're expecting all the extras (e.g., behind the scenes, deleted scenes or interviews), extended clips this set is NOT for you. All 8 movies and that's it. Don't expect to get more than just the theatrical version of the movie. Better wait if you want the whole shebang.

B0068TJLSY|1.0|This was one of the worse movie ever made, it was another Cloverfield. We lost interest after 15 minutes, the previews made it look good, but it wasn't. The kids did great, they have a future in acting. Rent it if you don't believe me but don't waste your money buying it, it is a watch once movie.

B005LJITS0|4.0|I agree what the WB attempted with Ultraviolet is BS. But I saw that the rental was 99¢ so I figured, if the movie was so bad I wouldn't be out that much money if I saw it since I was bored and didn't have much else to do and this was the one movie I didn't see in the theaters because of all the anti-hype hype.<br /><br />Rating just the movie itself, it's pretty good. Pretty average fare for a super hero movie, but not as terrible as as some have made it out to be. I think the trailers made it look worse than it really was (and They didn't help the movie any). Plus there seems to be an over-saturation of super hero movies for some people and I can totally see that as contributing to the low ratings. People are tired of them. Frankly, so am I. But if you aren't, this isn't a half bad movie. Pretty epic and a good start to a series (minor spoiler: looks like it's meant to have sequels considering the last scene with Sinestro, but then again, didn't you see that coming a mile away?).<br /><br />I say forego buying the physical copy and just rent it from Amazon Instant Video. That is until they offer it in a non-hairloss-enducing physical+digital version. The movie itself is pretty good.
0553801473|2.0|i dont know why i continue reading this series. all this book consisted of was characters moving but not getting anywhere, nothing gets accomplished and all the good characters die in the end. actually thats the story of the whole series. continually disappointing.
1612680003|1.0|If you're lucky enough to be a 9 year-old with 2 dads, one telling you to get educated financially and the other to get a formal college education, you have to be on the path to a good life anyway.  This book tells normal working people nothing about getting out of the rat race. He does spend quite a few pages explaining the difference between an asset and a liability, well duh. Yes we know our cars are depreciating assets, we don't need to be told his wife paid cash for a brand new Mercedes, how many working class stiffs can afford to pay cash for a car? Or maybe we peons should just take the bus and live in cardboard boxes - we certainly don't want the liability of owning our own homes now do we? Oh sorry, we should rent from him I forgot, and make him wealthier.  I found the book pedantic, repetitious and badly written. He treats working class people like ignorant serfs and beats his chest when it comes to talking about how  working people are all taxed to death, while rich folks like him don't pay their fare share.  He should run for office alongside  all those other greedy Republicans.  He must have made millions from touting this useless crap to the masses. All it does is state the bloody obvious. It will be an asset to my recycle bin. I wish I could give it zero stars.

B005P89F1C|5.0|One fine day, as I was sitting on the porch of my trailer home, my first cousin/ex-lover Jim-Bob surprised me with this wonderful gift. It was Bieb's Xmas CD! I was so happy and excited that I nearly dropped my jug of moonshine all over the place!<br /><br />I immediately retired into my one-room trailer home which I share with twelve other family members. Jim-Bob wanted to come in, but I told him that it was over between us, since I had caught him making out with his mama. Anyway, I digress...<br /><br />So I listened to the Bieb's Xmas tunes with great delight. He really is a talented young fellow. Then the next thing I know, there's a knock at the door. The voices in my head told me it was Bieber, so I answered it. Soon he was on top of me for a 30-second encounter of orgasmic proportions. He told me that I was his first.<br /><br />Now I am knocked up. I am a 20-year-old high school dropout living on food stamps and government cheese, while Justy Biebs rakes in millions. I really am emotionally stable. Don't let my multiple piercings and crystal meth/crack ho look fool you. All I want is for Biebee to pay child support.<br /><br />Surely you wouldn't judge the morals of a fine young lady like me? Justy, call me! I can be reached at the payphone at the entrance of my trailer park, or at the welfare office, or at my dealer's place.<br /><br />Happy Holidays,<br /><br />From Ms. Yeater
B005HWUCMC|4.0|There are some songs on this album but overall, it's a great purchase. I'd actually probably give this a 4.5 - which is pretty good considering that's me reviewing all the songs. It's pretty much impossible to get 5 out of 5 stars for me. Nonetheless, I recommend this highly. It has a mix of both upbeat songs as well as much more slow dramatic songs.

So after years of refusing, I picked this one up. I just don't get what the fuss is about. I read the other reviews, and some were saying that she can be a hit or miss author, which I get - but I have so far just read her misses. Maybe someone can give me a reccomendation of her hits - though even then is all about perspective.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|This is an excellent movie and an interesting adaptation of Jane Eyre, but the killing point for it was what scenes they had chosen to delete. I had initially watched this and was unimpressed (despite my love for both of the actors), but the deleted scenes pushed it up to a movie that I wanted to own. They filled in the confusing gaps and added the creepiness of the original story. It even made me forgive the surprisingly quiet (almost flat) portrayal of Rochester. I really really hope a director's cut is released that includes those scenes...

0739337270|5.0|somebody said this book deserved more than 5 stars and i completely agreed. It's a brilliant story about a girl adopted by 'normal' German family during WWII, her adventures with school-mate Rudy, admiration for books, and fondness for music played by the loving papa.  It's also a tragic story about fanatical Germans, atrocities of the war and the brutality of the regime leading to the death of millions of people around the world.   But the books is not about politics. It's about normal but poor live in Germany, and about the power of words. I loved the book and was impressed by the narrator reading that book on CDs. Highly recommended for adults and children.

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Supposedly this comes with a Digital Copy.  However, it does not.  I know others have already mentioned this, but I was so furious I had to write my own review.
0553805371|4.0|Its first chapters are excellent reflections on the origin of the world and why we should not consider ourselves as the only living beings in the universe. Science, each day advances more and is able to explain that a system does not one but many stories and they can be better analyzed by a scientist than a philosopher. Religion is increasingly viewed against the evidences discovered by scholars.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in its middle chapters, to try to justify (rightly) the conclusions of those researchs, the author delves into topics difficult to assimilate by the amateur reader that does not have enough knowledge of physics, which makes it a tough theme to assimilate.<br /><br />Nevertheless its findings make a good subject for further research and reflection. We live in a world that has a very specific set of features to support life, but are not necessarily uniques in the universe. Probably in another space with a set of rules different from that of our globe there can be life and life with, probably, very different conditions.
B00008YLV2|5.0|This is the story of the disastrous raid in Mogadishu on October 3rd, 1993. (The battle lasted over to the next morning, meaning the soldiers were trapped with dwindling ammo, no food, and little if any water in that climate overnight.)  Several of the men who participated in that battle served as advisors or extras on the film, which resulted in one Ranger getting his SAG card! There were a few teensy errors----a couple pieces of music on the soundtrack weren't released at the time, the Grisham book seen in one scene wasn't released in paperback at the time----but it did a very good job in displaying what real combat is like, without going too far in one direction or another, as civilians are wont to do when depicting soldiers.  We either wind up getting shown as emotionless robots or overly emotional wrecks.<br /><br />  The raid was doomed from the beginning, as Colonel Bobby McKnight dryly points out. \\"Daytime, in the afternoon, when they're all (non-Amazon-approved expletive) up on khat, in the one part of the city where they can muster resistance at the drop of a hat? What's not to like?\\" (Paraphrased.)  Soldiers pride themselves on their bearing, their self control, their strength, so there were a few scenes that were a little 'actorish' but not nearly as often as one finds them in other, less serious, movies. (It's easier, I suspect, to portray emotions than to first attain self control and portray controlled-emotions spilling out due to extreme conditions.)<br /><br />  The Army wanted to go in to get a bunch of Aidid henchmen,  but their own lax security meant that the population was ready for them. One guy in the book mused on the various flaws in their security: the aircraft hanger they were in faced the city so anybody with binoculars could see when the troops started running around getting ready, plus it was protected only by Hescos by the chow hall, so all it would take was one suicide bomber at chow time and you'd take out a whole squad at least.  There's one extremely low-key but chilling scene where the Blackhawks are flying into the city and a kid with an early-era cell phone holds it up to catch the sound of the rotars---and the soldiers think the kid is waving. By the time the choppers get to the target area,  the tire fires are burning, funeral pyres for victims that still have a short while to live.<br /><br />  Two choppers down meant the mission lost the 'initiative', a term that has a lot of meaning for soldiers, some of it nearly superstitious. The personnel from the choppers had to be rescued,  even if they were dead, but the fighting was so incredible that the bodies of Shughart and Gordon wound up getting left behind to be dragged through the streets. The bravery of Gary Gordon and Randy Shughart was given a matter-of-fact treatment that might have reduced the impact on civilians, but Sam Sheppard's dry, pained questioning of the two made it clear that they knew they were going to almost certain death.  The film also captured what looked like realistic shooting; the Americans tended to pick their shots carefully, while the Somalians sprayed,  which is what so many directors have so many characters do in far too many movies. In real life, sometimes one finds civilians get bribed to do this for fifty bucks and the emptying of a certain number of magazines.<br /><br />  The movie has an amazing cast of headliners in every role,  from Sam Sheppard as General Garrison, to Jason Isaacs as Captain Steele. A couple of the REAL pilots from the battle flew the choppers, and some of the extras were portrayed by participants as well. (I noted with some amusement that the actors were put through a truncated version of one of the courses I took during my first enlistment!) When one thinks of what this movie would have been like in other hands, it's enough to make one cringe.<br /><br />  The high-powered cast makes the characters memorable, because battles don't leave a lot of room for lengthy speeches, and theonly glitches---as I noted---are minor and mostly necessary to compress Mark Bowden's excellent book down into three hours. The score was instantly recognizable as one of Hans Zimmer's, and it's interesting to spot faces that Scott went on to use again, as he often does.<br /><br />  This review comes from one of the few times I've been able to watch the movie. Its accuracy can make it hard viewing for anybody who's gone through anything of the sort, while Hollywood tripe tends to be comfortingly entertaining thank to its very unreality.  For civilians, this gives you a taste of what it's like.nd mostly necessary to compress Mark Bowden's excellent book down into three hours.

1451648537|5.0|Excellent. Even Steve Jobs would have liked this well-crafted book. It's accurate, fast-moving, heartwarming, and educational. Having worked at Apple during the turbulent mid-1980s, I found the book almost too well-written. I started having nightmares about Steve Jobs! But once I got past those difficult times in the narrative, I found the book technically and emotionally compelling. Jobs would have liked that it appeals to that place where technology and liberal arts meet. The technical material is generally right on, even though the author is not an engineer, and there are a couple of minor mistakes. The story-telling and the personality descriptions are also right on. I found it so sad to learn about Jobs' eating disorder, and that his reality distortion field probably played a part in him not getting cancer surgery soon enough. Isaacson lets us see just how truly insanely great Steve Jobs was. May he (Jobs) rest in peace and may the computer industry never forget the lessons he taught us about design, ease-of-use, perfectionism, and leadership.

B005TQAI6G|3.0|I would have loved to have seen this concert in person; then I may have found the energy that was missing from the DVD.  As I watched the concert unfold, I was disappointed with the fact that the music sounds EXACTLY like the disc.  By saying this, I mean, that there is no \\"live\\" vocals on the DVD.  After reading more reviews, I find it's because they dubbed over her singing specifically for the DVD.  Very disappointing.  Don't get me wrong with the rest of the review, I have been a fan of Britney since she hit the scene but the woman has no grace.  You can chalk it up to bad knees and what not but she just clomps her way through the steps.  A lot of the time, she's upstaged by the talent of her dancers.  It's a given that she's not the same as she was ten years ago but she should exploit her strengths not try to keep the same ol', same ol'.  It seems forced.  Another review mentioned that it appears her heart isn't in it.  I would agree.  She's just going through the motions and speaking the scripted lines with little to no presence...though, she does look wonderful.  All in all, I'd rather listen to the CD than watch this DVD.

B00328G4V6|4.0|I see that ROLLING STONE just released--I believe their SECOND \\"All Time Greatest Guitarist\\" roster--and not surprisingly, it's pretty controversial in the blogosphere. And equally unsurprisingly, Jimi Hendrix's numero uno position is likely the ONE thing about the list that actually isn't controversial.  It's hard to imagine another rock guitarist as universally revered.    The standard line, of course, is that Hendrix expanded the vocabulary of the electric guitar something like a hundredfold.  Others would maintain he went beyond that and invented a whole new musical language: call it Venusian maybe.  Or Neptunian.  I'll buy that.  It's easy to see (and, more importantly, HEAR) why more than one generation of guitarists would worship Hendrix.  Guitar loving non-players (and I number myself among them) sense his greatness as well--as can any number of more casual music fans.    The real question--after 40 years of posthumous releases cropping up with frequent regularity--is how much of the \\"unapproved\\" product serves his legacy and reputation, and how much of it is overkill (or downright dross).    Listening to VALLEYS OF NEPTUNE for the first time, I wondered if we hadn't reached the point of diminishing returns when it came to mining the vault.  The strongest songs on the record seemed to be alternate takes of well-known numbers like \\"Fire,\\" \\"Red House\\" and (to a lesser extent) \\"Stone Free.\\"  Other numbers seemed to be undeveloped, if not half-baked--and, yeah, there was a lot of jamming, if you're up for that.  But after multiple listens, the record as a whole really did start to grow on me.  I'd hear something different with each successive playing.  Suddenly the jams made more sense, the self-consciously Dylanesque lyrics of some of the tunes would contain a flash of poetry that made them more interesting as SONGS than they had appeared at first.  The bluesman swagger on some of the other tracks seemed less to me like the posturing I'd found them to be at first and more like the affectionate embrace of the blues genre's longstanding conventions.  So this particular trip to Neptune was certainly not without its rewards, especially once you got your bearings.  Most of the tracks were recorded in the immediate wake of ELECTRIC LADYLAND, and they sort of continue in that wide-ranging, hit-or-miss tradition.  Lots of brilliant moments, and you find that as a listeneing EXPERIENCE, it does hold up.  You can't really call all of  it \\"tight,\\"9 but then, what Hendrix record could you call that? ARE YOU EXPERIENCED maybe.  That was as tuneful and tight as he got.  Much of the rest is brilliant in other ways.  You listen for the great moments, which are there all right and they jump out at you at odd moments.    Even with LADYLAND, the critical rap at the time was that it could have been condensed down to a quite solid single disk.  Fewer make that argument today.  You'd miss too many great moments.  There are enough such moments on NEPTUNE to make it worth a listen.  Or several.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I saw the previews and they did not give much away so I was not sure what to expect when I went with my 5 yr old and her grandma to see this. We were all pleasantly pleased!! I thought it would not compare to Shrek, I mean Shrek is a fav in our household. So, I do not want to give the story away. But I will say, a lot of characters, a great plot and story layout, great animation, cute part where they show baby puss and how he got his boots. I really enjoyed this movie, my child wanted to go back to the theater to see again. Even her grandma was saying how much she enjoyed it, so I would say good for all ages. If you watch this and do not laugh I would be very surprised. We were laughing a lot & I heard many in the theater laughing the whole time. It is a great movie... we look forward to when it comes on on DVD. I would even go as far as saying I see a sequel for this film.
0375842209|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend who is an author herself.  She said it was the best book she had ever read and I had to know why. I'm so glad I did.  As a person whose heritage is German, I have always read stories from WWII with tremendous feelings of sadness.  This book weaves a tale that is both heartwrenching and uplifting in the same sentence.  The format was a bit unusual, but added to the mesmerizing effect of the story line.  And the author's unusual use of verbs and adjectives shows his deep love for words.  I will definitely recommend this book to others, and look forward to re-reading it in the not-too-distant future.

1593080719|3.0|I ordered this book weeks ago. I have not yet received it. I have had a couple of emails from Amazon (one saying they were having trouble locating it, another saying they located a copy but it would be a few weeks until I received it), but still no book.
1594744769|3.0|Heard so many good things about this, and, the photo/tie-in/plot idea intrigued me. The book has its moments, and the writing is overall more intelligent than lots of YA out there - that I appreciated. I was disappointed that something that initially appeared very creative fell into traps of cliche. There wasn't anything in the plot that surprised me or made me think, that's clever--except the use of the pictures. Even with that, some of them were so bizarre that I read thinking, \\"is this more about a fascination with odd photos or a story convoluted to go along with the odd photos?\\"<br /><br />Each reader will have to decide for himself.<br /><br />I appreciated the clean storyline, the lack of abundant swearing.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This grabbed me from the cover and then I read the inside cover panel.  The premise and incorporation of the photographs made me want to take a chance on it.  I'm glad I did!  I'm not done with it yet but its such an addictive read that I couldn't put it done other than for sleeping.  Highly recommended to any and all!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|After extensive research, decided to go with the MDR7506. Became tired of having to throw broken sets away, as like most things these days when something breaks. With the MDR7506, a person can obtain the parts, so the set will last for many years. The comments from some about the ear pads being not so great, are justified in my opinion. As for the sound quality, they are excellent. For anyone looking to purchase headphones, these should be one on top of the list.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|I'm currently using this item and couldn't be more pleased with it. When I first soldered the connections I was an idiot and forgot to put the sleeve on first so I had to re-solder everything, but it has worked wonderfully ever since. I highly recommend ordering this item over running to Radioshack and buying a similar plug. I did that for my other pair of headphones and no matter what I do that pair finds some way to short out. I'll probably end up buying another one of these for it, honestly.
0545265355|5.0|es un producto magnifico, de excelente material, asi como de contenido una literatura sumamente entretenida, la cual no dudo en recomendarla a cualquiera.....
B005B19UPE|5.0|Sarah's Key is a difficult story to read at the beginning, but completing  this read is very worthwhile.  Human dignity is preserved, and human suffering is overcome in the end.    Sarah is a complex character whose life follows a tragic path, but who  did find happiness for a while.  Her \\"end\\" is understandable and the  legacy she left is a morality tale for the ages.
1591841666|3.0|I thought I knew when to quit...apparently not.  This short read it a wonderful approach to some of life's quandaries and puts things in an interesting perspective.  Why have we excelled at the things in life and chosen not to pursue other things?  The Dip explores the notion to quit early versus pushing through the rough parts and possibly succeed.  Let's not think path of least resistance, but the right path for each of us in our life's pursuits.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I can't stop playing this on my kindle fire! I would prefer having a few more options, but it's free so I won't complain.
B005KELW26|1.0|Aside that I received it a week after the estimated date, when I did I was not happy. This is nothing  but a piece of cardboard and it is definitely not worth $30. I may return it.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|I would love to have the Mist on blu-ray, but since I don't own a blu-ray player this special edition version of the movie is the very next best thing. This is a 2 disc set that features the original movie and an amazing black and white version which is a must have. The black and white version of the Mist makes the movie seem even more like a 1950's monster movie, and was perfect to watch on Halloween this year. There are tons of special features including an intro to the black and white movie by Frank Darabont. I was lucky enought to snag the dvd for $5. If you're a big Mist fan, Stephen King or Frank Darabont fan, or just like horror movies in general and have never seen The Mist don't make the mistake of buying the plain dvd, and make sure to buy the 2 disc special edition with the black and white movie, even if it's no longer just $5, it's completely worth it!<br />Also fans of the Walking Dead will find \\"Dale\\", \\"Andrea\\" and \\"Carol\\" are all cast members on The Mist. I was aware of Laurie Holden's part in The Mist but didn't recall the other two actors until watching The Mist again this year, and that was cool.
B000062XGB|5.0|I recommend this purchase,  It was a very pleasant surprise.  I expected something similar to an older version of this movie which I also liked very much but never purchased.  The actors, scenery and everything about was great.
B000IKHNT8|4.0|It's the \\"Bonus Disc\\" that's the original version, when it should be the main one. If they wanted to add the \\"updated\\" versions, THAT should be the Bonus Disc.<br /><br />I was about to complain just before I figured it out.<br /><br />If they want to release the original version, just release it by itself. We already had the newer version. Now we have two of those and one of the original.<br /><br />Personally, I'm tired of these add-ins in DVDs, etc, most of which are just plain silly or obviously designed by computer graphics.
0446573019|5.0|THIS BOOK moves a warp speed.  If you like Baldacci, you will love this one.  Highly recommend you get one for Christmas.  Or two.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Apologies for the delay in feedback for buying Capt. America. The BD discs play great, I received the set super quick. Very satisfied!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This version of spider solitaire is actually really impressive for a free app. It features different levels of game play (one to four suits) and is fairly smooth . The ads are ugly but I haven't had any issues with closing or skipping through them. Overall not too shabby
B0009P5YXO|5.0|The item arrived as described.  IT is a fun item for any Dr. who fan.  My son really enjoys it.
1451627289|5.0|I mostly don't read fiction, and never read horror or occult books. I can only remember finishing two of King's books ('It' and 'The Stand') and abandoning most of them out of sheer boredom.  I purchased '11/22/63' at 4:00 PM on a Saturday and finished at 3:00 AM the following Monday. It held my interest all of the way. When I finished, I had the same sort of gut-wrenching emotion that I had reading 'Jude the Obscure' and 'The French Lieutenant's Woman'. I can't single out any single aspect as being superior (characterization, plot, mood, tempo, etc.) but this book has emotional heft as well as physical heft.  Message to the author: Stephen, if you happen to read this -- personally, I think of time as a stream, and thought your association of the butterfly effect and time travel absolutely did not work. Alternate and parallel universes work, but it seems to me that changes in the past have their most immediate effect at the time of the change, and the as time passes the stream converges so that after a while the change becomes extremely hard to distinguish (diluted if you will). Obviously, this is a metaphysical subject rather than a physical one, so we can't know. But to take a couple of historical examples, do you really think that the battle of Cynoscephalae, or the battle of Manzikert, changed modern history to any significant degree? And don't you think that these two events were much more important than the assassination of JFK? Don't you think that '11/22/63' would have had more emotional power if the actions of George Amberson had merely impacted the lives of Sadie, Deke, Mimi, Al, Harry, Marina, and Lee (and all the rest) instead of the physical universe? Don't you think that we can relate to Jake's loss of Sadie much more than was can to nuclear holocaust? We can all relate to the loss of a loved one, but the end of the world in another matter. You absolutely did not need to introduce the issue of time travel tearing apart the fabric of nature ... this is,unless you wanted to go in an entirely different direction. I thought this part was both gratuitous and distracting, and marred the very end of a wonderful work.
0439023521|5.0|Best book I have ever read and I dont usually read books. Couldn't stop reading it-read the whole thing in a day and a half. Worth the money! Went and bought the other 2 books.  I suggest just buying the whole set instead of one at a time because it is cheaper that way.  Cant wait to see the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I was forced to buy this to watch a movie I had rented while out of town on business.  I intended to watch the movie on the flight home but the internet at my hotel had other ideas.  After 16hrs of downloading, the movie was only at 65% complete.  Now that I was home, it seemed silly to watch the movie on the iPad and thought I could stream it from iTunes to my TV, WRONG.  if you rent a movie from iTunes on the iPad, you must watch it on the iPad.  This adpater came in handy for displaying the iPad on my TV via HDMI.  Great picture and sound.  Well worth the money.
B00005QZWI|2.0|I love the music of the lord of the rings but the case that the cd came in was totally broken and can not be used.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I found this Alarm Clock Xtreme app awhile ago and loved it.  I install this on all the Android tablets and smartphones I get.  This has more customizable options than the stock alarm app in Android.  I like the fade in option for the alarms where the alarms starts at a low volume and slowly increases.  I find this to less jarring to wake up to.  I use that in combination with the vibrate function.  I also like the very large snooze button that is easy for me to see in the dark with my glasses off.  There are also several different snooze methods in this app.    1 - Press on screen button  2 - Press side buttons  3 - Shake phone  4 - Solve math problems  5 - No snooze  I prefer to use option 1 to press the on screen button.  I've also tried option 4 to solve math problems.  you can set the math difficulty from easy to hardest.  Easiest would be something like 5 + 1 = ?  Also you can choose how many you have to solve correctly to snooze.   This is one of the smallest apps on my devices and only takes up 1MB of room.  I recommend this to anyone looking for more options in an alarm app on their Android smartphone or tablet.
0956251579|4.0|I read this book in two days because I couldn't put it down! I loved the way the writer alternates between past and present tracking Catherine's life. There were a couple of bits that needed a strong stomach, but overall I loved this book. Highly recommended for those who enjoy a psychological thriller.
1400069181|5.0|This was an incredibly awesome book to read!  I do not consider myself a reader, however this book kept me so interested that I read it in a matter of days.  I started my own business in the spring of 2011 and learned about TOMS shortly thereafter.  I have adopted my own 1-For-1 biz model and it is amazing the difference it makes.  My marketing business was designed to make the world a better place and reading this book helped me fine tune the model.  It was amazing to read, hear, and appreciate how similarly I started my biz to how TOMS was founded in regards to the support from friends & fam, intern program, and working in a home office.  I'm a huge supporter of this book to go along with books like \\"Swim the Sharks\\", \\"How to win friends & influence people\\" -- \\"start something that matters\\" is a great book for aspiring entrepreneur, business minded folks, anyone into making the world a better place, and for an overall real book sharing some personal stories along with other interesting stories of successful entrepreneurs!  Happy reading!  Sam
1451627289|5.0|This was my first King novel and it exceeded my expectations. I've never read King as the horror genre doesn't interest me much. But the premise of this book sounded intriguing so I gave it a go. The novel wasn't anywhere near horror, I'd venture to say that it strikes close to a tale of romance. I never would've thought Stephen King could write romance, a fantastically riveting one at that.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this CD. 'Clapton' is a collection of old, many forgotten, easy listening songs. I was reminded of why songs such as; 'Autumn Leaves'and 'How Deep is the Ocean', were as popular as they were. Many I had never heard before, but totally enjoying after sitting back and listening to an old troubador doing his thing.
B005UKJX4E|4.0|Films like 2001:A Space Odyssey may have been too esoteric to digest, or also misinterpreted in its time. Tree of Life asks more questions than it answers. Its not your average movie experience and deserves to be viewed from a different perspectus. I enjoyed the imagery and submitted to the journey it led me through. From a Cinematography aspect it was breathtaking, and I absorbed every frame like it was a piece of art. A Film like this I admit, is not for everyone, but if your open to something fresh or different, it's difficult not appreciate something this extraordinary.
1466208686|5.0|This book is just amazing. The author makes sure to cover all important aspects as far as a coding interview is concerned. Moreover it also teaches how to approach a question even if you haven't seen it. Explanation is extremely easy to understand. As far as my experience is concerned, This book ensures to try and eliminate 'surprise element' in any coding interview. All I can say is: \\"Thank you Gayle, for all your efforts and support!!!\\"
B001VZY4M8|4.0|I love the music and the quality was great.  Nice price too.  I would definitely reorder.  This one is a classic.
B005TQAI6G|3.0|I have some mixed feelings on this concert DVD. What I like, is the film quality. It's very high def, and it just looks pretty. Britney's body is also impressive. I haven't actually seen this concert in person, But as a die-hard, i've seen bits on youtube dozens of times. Her body looks much more fit in this particualar Femme Fatale showing than others.. I notice some very defined abs, and i've actually wondered if it's just airbrushing... and if it is, that's a dissapointment.   Everybody always says how this tour is apperently sung mostly live. If so, that's wonderful, but this DVD doesn't prove that at all. I was especially annoyed at how when she sang \\"don't let me be the last to know\\", it was just the track off of \\"Oops I did it again\\". Listen closely.. it's the EXACT SAME ONE. No live singing there. Really? All she was doing was sitting on a swing. I noticed that the very last line was sung live... But it sounded very weak.   Wasn't impressed with her Slave 4 u routine at all. Her backup dancers were making her look bad. Another thing that pisses me off, is there's nothing else on the DVD except for the concert. No behind the scenes, no interviews, nothing. That had me a little shocked.  I give this DVD a 7/10. It's okay, if you're die hard. it's nice to see her in action, if you can even call this action.. I miss her FLATTERING outfits. Those ankle-high boots she wore the entire time were hideous! Also the \\"baby one more time\\" performance was tacky and stupid.
0316098329|4.0|\\"Room\\" is a story from headlines that we've all seen: a man kidnaps a young woman and holds her captive for years for his pleasure.  The story reminded me most of the case of Elisabeth Fritzl in Germany, whose father held her captive for 24 years and fathered a total of 7 children with her.  In this story, the narrator is Jack, the five-year-old son of his captive Ma.  Their story is in two parts.  First is their life in the eponymous Room, and then their life after they gain their freedom.    Both parts of the story are perceptive considerations of what it might be like to be in such a horrid circumstance.  Room is tiny.  Everything is a character in their tiny Room, from Bed to Chair to Toilet.  They are at the mercy of the man who Jack calls Old Nick.  Old Nick provides the power to their Room, brings them groceries, and even brings them small treats on Sundays.  Jack describes their life in the Room, both when Old Nick is happy with them and when Old Nick is angry.  Jack also obliquely describes the abuse that his Ma endures at Old Nick's hands.    Ma is (of course!) depressed by her situation, but Jack's growth spurs her to devise a plan of escape.  Her plan doesn't quite go off as expected, but they gain their freedom anyway.    The second part of the story addresses the \\"what now?\\" question.  After being held in a tiny room for so long, and in the case of Jack never even seeing the sky, how do they recover?  How do they deal with their family and with a media who wants a piece of them?  There are some obvious things, like having weakened immune systems because they haven't come in contact with any germs.  Jack has trouble with depth perception because his world has been so small, and he's pretty freaked out at the shower (even though his Ma relishes it).    I read all of Room in one sitting.  I even flipped back to the escape story and re-read it after I had finished the book.  I felt like I must have missed some details in reading it so fast the first time because I wanted to know what happened.  Using Jack as the narrator gives the story a different voice than expected, and it's engrossing to compare Jack's description of his life with a normal childhood.  With Jack's limited viewpoint and knowledge, the author probably avoids some pitfalls of trying to speak for the abducted Ma.  I think that the first half is the stronger half of the story, especially in some of the interactions between Ma and her parents.  But overall, I'd recommend the book.  It's not a beach read, but it's engrossing, and the story moves very quickly.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What can I say...It's a Bible...Nicely laid out and easy to read. Bookmarks are handy. My phone Galaxy S2 Skyrocket reads it all to me via text to speech which makes this an awesome app. Thanks to the devs for making it free, bless you.
B000HEVALC|4.0|As an Elvis fan I have to have everything, so this cd was a great addition, to my collection. What is also well worth the price is that you get so many gospel tracks as well. This particular cd feattures mainly on Elvis singing ( with Carl, Jerry and Johnny Cash).A must for the Elvis collector
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Excellent purchase.  The Blu-Ray arrived quickly and in a sealed container.  It was nice to see an old classic redone for Blu-Ray, and the picture quality is very nice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Go and download this book right now and then come back and read this review, do it now, I will wait for you... Did you get it okay great, now read this and then read that book.<br /><br />  I am not sure if any of you are like I was when I first heard about this I was not sure what to think and then I found out it is being made into a movie and that got me thinking a bit more about it, I heard mixed reviews about the book and then I saw a trailer for the movie and I bought the book. Oh my I am so glad I did this is one of the best books I have read in a while, I really love this book and I am getting the second book Catching Fire right after I post this review. I will probably get the third book right after I read the second one. You should get all three of these books. Now!! [[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]]
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|The local cinpelex was quickly \\"sold out\\" for an opening weekend matinee of this Oscar worthy film (\\"best actor\\" and/or \\"best movie\\".)  Clooney is neither a spy, lover or intellegiecnce operative in this one.  Seems to be a wealthy but \\"regular guy\\" with a regular family who runs into a series of tragicomic events that ring true to the ordinary viewer.  The movie ran for about 2-hours but didn't seem to drag at all. Clearly out of the mainstream for a \\"Hollywood\\" production but more enjoyable than most. It most certainly deserves all of the positive buzz it's been receiving
B004BJMEO6|5.0|<3But the DVD was notplaced right but it play all throw the movie great so I didn't returned the movie:)So I should've  rate it3in a half  but am not cause it's a great movie
B004SBS8LA|5.0|As the title says... The shined up graphics are nicely polished but I prefer not watching my score compile before me. Good puzzles, interesting new birds, and a dog (on one level). Worth it.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|Great Fun to use, once you master the moves and spells. It's a little complicated at times until you remember what each move represents.
B004SBX112|5.0|More puzzles, graphic reversion (mostly with the gui) to original with new graphics (scenery and world objects) as well. Fun game and very much enjoyed recent update.
0810970686|5.0|My son just became interested in the Wimpy Kid books a few weeks back.  When this book arrived, he read it within the 1st 24 hours.  He loved it.
B004V98UKS|4.0|Fun puzzles, fun app (for the most part). The pacing of the gui's level transition could be a tad faster for my preference.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|game works great on my g2x and g2. wish they of update will new levels or have a sequel. play it all the time
B004LZFWJO|3.0|Seems like a lot of games very similar, (connect items on a grid in a certain manner, they disappear, remaining items in that column drop down followed by new ones filling the gaps) although the not exactly congruent connectivity is interesting (it allows diagonal connections ). Graphics are medium interesting, the best part, though, is that it's timed.
B003UD7JEO|5.0|The show has a good balance between action, plot, and drama. It moves forward at a good pace and has good characters.
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I was not familiar with the Green Lantern back story so things started a bit slow.  Once the movie got into the story it moved along.  Great CG.  Ryan Reynolds is not your typical action hero, but does a good job with this role.  He looks great in costume.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|So glad to purchase this Season one series.  Having not viewed during the regular season, it was nice to see all the episodes without having to wait a week for the next one.  This series is addicting, keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0056BU3I2|4.0|*I am a fan of this type of movie.  I've seen all of the Fast & Furious flicks.  This is the best one so far.  Dwayne Johnson adds a new dimension.  He plays well against the other characters.  If you like lots of action, gun fights, car crashes and stunts, then this is your movie
0679882820|5.0|We have owned this book for years - it's perfect for children from birth all the way up to early reading (K-1st grade) - I recently bought it for a friend who has a newborn and a 2-year-old, and they love it! This is a terrific book for young children.
B005B19UPE|5.0|The book is very sensitive and heart wrenching. I ordered a used book from booksindemand.com which arrived almost new...a few handwritten notes on a few pages but I don't mind. I recommend this novel to anyone interested in what happened to human beings during the WWII horror.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app works just as great as it does on my phone! It's a great battery saver too.  I think anyone who hasn't tried will love it as well.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|Immediately after you finish watching this depressing documentary go and read all the negative reviews so you can have a good laugh. I'm usually too lazy to write a review about anything but after reading some of the negatives, I had to write something.<br /><br />If you don't want to read them it's the usual:<br /><br />\\"Crazy Al Gore pseudo science\\"--\\"just libruls blaming Bush and Cheney!\\"--the \\"he's another wannabe Michael Moore hippy\\" ad hominen and the always reliable knee-slapper \\"toxins are caused by methane that cows naturally breathe out!\\" reactions.<br /><br />I liked it because it was the right mix of info and entertainment. He's just an average guy with a video camera, who gets offered $100,000 to just sign a piece of paper and he wants to know why. It reminded me a lot of the Erin Brockovich story--just without all the cleavage, and I also think I learned something.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Disappointed that you can only view 10 messages at a time.  Definitely something that needs to be updated in order to make the app more useful.
B004ZJZPZC|1.0|It's really quite simple: if you're a huge ABBA fan, you're going to love this movie.  If not (I fall into this category), the movie will be torture to watch.<br /><br />The only reason this musical and movie have such a strong following is that ABBA has a fanbase of baby-boomers that love their music.  Those fans, watching this movie, love the music so much that they are blind to the shallow characters, flimsy plot, and all of the forced, unrealistic scenes.  I had always thought it was backwards and just plain wrong to write a story based on the music of a band.  These fears were confirmed when my eyes witnessed this film.<br /><br />As a theater major and actor, I have seen countless plays, musicals, and movies, so don't discredit my review and think that I don't know a musical is indended to be campy and corny.  The issues I had with this film had nothing to do with the corniness.  I will hear people say that they can tell the actors were having fun while filming the movie.  Unfortunately, that does nothing for me as the viewer.  Find a Jr. High with a lousy theater program doing \\"Grease.\\"  They too are \\"having fun.\\"<br /><br />It's possible that my review would be different if the band involved were AC/DC or Paul Simon, but until that movie gets made, I feel I must warn the world that there are better ways to spend your time.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|Season 1 left me wanting more and season 2 has delivered it. As far as the romance goes with Glenn and Maggie, that's fine. It builds their relationship, and what could be brewing between Carol and Daryl. I find that interesting. The fact that Rick wanted Hershel to allow them to stay is because he is afraid for Lori b/c she's pregnant, and Carl. Yes, it's only been a few weeks since he found them, but who wouldn't see Hershel's farm as a safe haven for awhile. There are no walkers, there's food, fresh water, and a house for protection. Except of course for the walkers in the barn. Episode 7 gave it a heart wrenching twist, so I am drooling for the second part of season 2. Shane, even though quite the jerk to some people, tends to save the day. He has survival at all cost in his mind, as would I if I were in that situation. His character is everything Rick's character is not. which I'm inclined to say is going to get him killed eventually(foresight there nothing more). Bronze and muscle is great when dealing with the dead, but not with the living. with all his faults, however, he is my faviorite characters apart from Daryl. I would recommend to anyone to read the comics. They are just as great as the show, and believe it or not, Lori's pregnancy has alot to do with how the writers do the next few seasons/episodes. (Hopefully there will be quite a few.) All in all, I'm hooked on the Walking Dead. One of the best tv series in along time.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this suspenseful 'what if' movie.  It pushes the bounds of what's possible with the fast pace, slick style, bold irreverence, escalating tension and edgy editing.  Watch it and get caught up!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great product.  Bought as a bday gift for my sister, however I have to return because she already owns it.  Will still buy from seller for future purchases!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Great movie, very well done.  I visited the battlefield recently and the movie was historically correct in most cases.  Would like to see the directors version with all the footage.  Hard to tell the whole story in an hour and one half.  Very good though.  Good price and delivered in a reasonable time in good condition.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have used it with all my digital devices for well over a year now (desktops, laptops, netbook, iPod touch and now Kindle Fire). It is my go to software for making notes, todo lists, phone logs, books to read, software to try, websites to revisit, and cool images to save. My only real complaint is that on most mobile devices you cannot simply clip web text like on a full computer so you usually just end up sending Evernote a link to the web site.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|Her show is amazing ! I was like: oh my god like: is it really britney ? like: damn gurl ! She's dancing not that much but it's very spectacular. She's not fat, she's not singing but her clothes are cool for a 90's prostitute. Her songs are always nice and they are a little bit remixed and pre-recorded so it's nice. I love the worldwide theme with new york, egyptian, asian... very sexy but in a nice way.<br />It's a nice live and it's cheap so buy it, you'll love it even if you're not a huge fan of her.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Im very disappointed about the Digital Copies by WB. They have two third party companies Flisxter and Ultraviolet to manage the digital copies you own. You have to sign in for both company and have different password. And I'm using Mac computer it means my digital download does not on itunes its on different folder so it will not sync on my ipod or play on apple TV... This is a waste of money if your into digital copy. And The download of the movie takes forever my took 8hrs... I suggest if your buying a movie and your main reason is the digital copy content of it try to find out if its ultraviolet streaming DONT BUY IT its not worth it...

0896898288|5.0|I've had this book for a while now and I have really enjoyed reading the letters from the farm wives featured. I love the pictures of the quilt blocks and instructions are included for assembling 111 blocks. That's more than enough blocks to help this beginning quilter satisfy my need for different block ideas. A DVD is also included with the book, but I have yet to look at it.<br /><br />I'm very happy with this book and feel it makes a great reference book for interesting quilt blocks.

1455510319|5.0|I picked up The Fifth Witness at an airport to kill time during an unexpected delay.  Given the source of the book, I didn't have high hopes.  I was pleasantly surprised and thought I should write a few words.  When I went to do so, I was equally surprised to see as many 5 ratings as 1's -- and little in between.  But, as other reviewers have noted, many of the bad reviews concern the Kindle price.    The Fifth Witness is timely, concerning attorney Michael Haller's efforts to earn a buck by representing the victims of fraudulent foreclosures.  I found myself being sucked in, just like him, when one client is accused of killing a banker who was trying to take her house.  It's as good a whodunnit as I can imagine, and contrary to all the nay-sayers, I can imagine Haller trying to balance a desire to reunite with his wife against his need to defend his client; his desire to mount a spirited defense, all the while wondering if he's representing a murderer.  This isn't great literature, but it's a damned fine escape.  This isn't a book you read in snatches on the bus on the way to work.  This is a book I can imagine reading at the beach - dog-eared, smelling faintly of suntan lotion, and beat-up from being passed from one beach bag to another.  Curl up in a big chair on a rainy Sunday.  Savor the story.  I'm sure there are lots of reasons to have an e-reader, but The Fifth Witness isn't one of them.

1931559317|5.0|The Sky & Telescope Pocket Sky Atlas is worth every penny, and more. While not literally pocket-sized, it's quite small, light, and easily portable. The spiral binding makes it easy to fold over to display just one page at a time, and so far the pages seem fairly durable. The layout is clearly explained and intuitive, with a thorough index in the back. The charts match up well with what I see in my fairly light-polluted backyard, and in combination with my upgraded 9x50 finder scope this atlas has allowed me to find objects I couldn't locate before when using just printouts from software programs and/or all-sky charts. Works well with my red-light flashlight. Also includes a scale visible at all times to help you determine how much of the chart will appear in your finder scope. If you don't already have a decent field atlas, get this one. You won't regret it!

B0050QV0RQ|5.0|I got Symphony of Eternity as a free app of the day. However, I would certainly pay the full price for it. It is fun, complex enough to hold my attention without being too difficult to learn, and well made. The graphics are limited in the play screen, but great in the more in depth conversation pictures. And even the limited graphics are more than sufficient for what you would expect from an inexpensive app.   The save feature is great and easy to use. The customizable characters are fun and likable. I've played for over six hours already on my Kindle Fire and it is still very enjoyable. I highly recommend this game.
1466401885|4.0|I had some of the same concerns that others did on this review blog. Yet I kept reading b/c I had to find out what happened, how it ended, etc.... Travis is the type of H we love to read about, but in real life would run as fast as we could to get a restraining order. In the first half of the book I really liked Abby, the second 1/2 she irritated me. I felt she caused many pain needlessly and acted immature, as did Travis. But then I remember their ages...so, this book was a page turner, not my normal \\"cup of\\" but I have to admit my dirty little secret....I kind of liked it.

0307891402|5.0|Well, a little back story:  I was undecided on whether or not I wanted the CE version of the guide, so I figured I'd wait a couple days after the game was released to decide.  Big mistake.  This thing is so limited in print that it was sold out... EVERYWHERE.  Two days after the game's release, there was nothing unless I wanted to pay $80 (I didn't) on an e-auction website or Amazon Marketplace.  I went to six different stores looking for this until I finally settled on the paperback.  Well folks, today I was walking through my local W-M and I looked in the strategy guide section to see if maybe there was a copy of this.  First off, the guide section was a mess and half the guides were so disfigured they weren't fit for sale...  Nice job W-M employees.  But after sifting through the books, the hardcover version of the Skyrim guide definitely wasn't there.  I started to leave and I pulled out my phone to text my friend and tell them I was never getting the hard cover guide.  I was so sad.  Lo and behold, out of the corner of my eye, I see the last copy of the book stashed under six copies of Dead Island on the very bottom shelf!  I was ecstatic.    I ran to the counter looking for someone to open the case for me, and finally the book was in my hands.  As I said, I already have the paperback version (Which I will be returning tomorrow).  The content is the same between the two versions, so I won't go into that unless I feel like updating this review later.  However, the hardcover has the free online interactive map (Haven't tried it yet, just got it today) and, durability wise, it feels like the best hardcover textbook you got in college.  This is a really big deal.  I bought the paperback for Oblivion, and after extended use by both myself and my brother, a few pages started to fall out.  The paperback version of the Skyrim guide has the same feel, and I fear the pages will eventually fall out, but I don't get that feeling with the hardcover.  So, in summary:  Paperback pros:  -Same content as Hardcover.  -Easy to find, cheap  Cons  -Doesn't include the interactive online map  -Probably won't hold up over time, feels flimsy  Hardcover pros:  -Feels VERY durable  -Beautiful cover picture  -Comes with interactive map  -Value has, and will continue to, skyrocket.  Collector's item.  Cons  -Collector's item.  VERY hard to find for a reasonable price.  If you can find one of these, even at $40, buy it!  Even if you don't want to keep it (I do), you can probably sell it for double or triple the price.

B0008ENICU|4.0|I had only seen clips of this movie prior to me buying and watching the whole thing on DVD. I was extremely seduced by the witty humor and lines that are constantly being thrown out at you. These women are feisty and they are very vocal about it. Although I did love the movie, the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I could definitely feel at times when I wasn't extremely invested in the movie. Overall, it was a good buy with an extremely interesting fashion segment in it. I believe if you are a fan of classic movies and humorous dialogue then you will enjoy this movie as well.

B002ZG99N6|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Based on the novel by Chuck Hogan, \\"The Town\\" is a superb drama set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a neighborhood in Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank and armored-car robbery capital of the world.  Writer/director Ben Affleck plays Doug MacCray, the leader of a sometimes unruly Irish gang that routinely engages in both those activities (the other members of the team include Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Owen Burke).  On one of their robberies, one of the members goes rogue by kidnapping an attractive bank manager and taking her along with them as a hostage.  Although she is blindfolded the entire time and is eventually set free, several of the robbers fear she may still someday be able to testify against them were they ever to come to trial.  To protect her against the more dangerous members of the group, Doug insinuates himself into her life and quickly finds himself developing a serious attraction to her.<br /><br />\\"The Town\\" works beautifully on so many different levels at once: as a thrilling crime-and-detection tale, a complex human drama, and a richly textured account of life in an individual neighborhood.  Doug may be torn between his criminal background and the love of a good woman who offers him a chance at a better life - but that doesn't stop him from still partaking in many of the foul deeds that have come to define his life over the years.  If anything, \\"The Town\\" shows just how deeply planted are the roots that bind us to the soil (i.e., neighborhood) of our past - and how hard it is to rip ourselves free from them and still continue to flourish.  In other words, it may be possible for a man to redeem himself in the eyes of God and his fellow citizens, but it may be a long and faltering journey on the way to that outcome.<br /><br />As a character, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is equally three-dimensional and complex.  She's a decent, hardworking young woman who tends her own garden in the city and volunteers her time in helping the youth in her community.  When she meets Doug, she is still traumatized by the events that have happened to her and is initially unaware that Doug had any part in them, believing him to be just an easygoing, compassionate man with whom she's falling in love.  How she'll react when she finds out the truth about Doug and how that revelation will affect their burgeoning relationship provides the key emotional focal point of the drama.<br /><br />Running contrapuntally to the romance is the attempt on the part of the FBI, led by John Hamm (minus his Don Draper Brylcreemed hair), and the Boston Police Department to capture the band of thieves.  There are moments of breath-bating suspense as the law inexorably closes in on its target, and Affleck proves once again that that much abused standby known as the \\"car chase\\" can still be a potent storytelling device when we actually care about what happens to the characters - even those it is not always all that easy to like.ommunity.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This may be an older movie but still was amazed by it. Found it very intertaining, for when this movie was created it was pretty amazing to watch.
B003UESJF6|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The blue-skinned, bulbous-headed, shape-shifting, malapropism-spouting space-creature known as Megamind (Will Ferrell) prides himself on being the baddest bad guy around.  His arch nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt), also a creature from beyond this world, is a squeaky-clean, universally beloved superhero who literally walks on water and keeps thwarting the plans Megamind has for ruling Metro City (which he mistakenly pronounces \\"metrocity\\").  When Megamind, much to his own surprise actually, manages to do away with Metro Man in a contentious battle-to-the-death, he begins to realize that being a villain isn't all it's cracked up to be without a worthy hero to call an opponent.  Thus, Megamind hatches a plot to clone another Metro Man figure out of some remnants of the dead hero's DNA.  But Megamind gets more than he bargained for when his creation comes to life.<br /><br />Though \\"Megamind, \\" directed by Todd McGrath, has the distinction of being one of the only family-oriented animated films ever to feature a bad guy as its main character, the movie may be too cerebral and esoteric to completely enthrall children and too undisciplined and gimmicky to appeal all that much to adults.  Still, the movie has a clean, sparkling look, filled with a whole host of futuristic devices in the foreground and stunning cityscapes in the background, and it moves fast enough to keep its audience focused on the screen for the duration.  It also features the voice of Tina Fey as the Sweet Polly Purebred-type TV news reporter who is a constant bone of contention between Metro Man and Megamind - and Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller add their own vocal support in minor but key roles.  And the script by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons contains an interesting subtext about the rewards and sacrifices that come with being both a hero and a villain, a subtext that brings an added dimension to the movie.

Made up of R&amp;B and the electronic-techno funk that seems to be coming back, this cd had me revved up and ready to go, especially in the mornings when I'm on my way to work and motivated to stay there.  It started to give me flashbacks of when me and my still best friend would hit the club scene and partake in a house party or two, and it was the funky beats before we left that got him in the frame of mind to drink and jam.  I don't think that Kelis reinvented herself with this recording, as much as defining her talents.  This cd, when keeping an open mind, is an accomplishment of sorts....just remember to break out the disco ball when you put it on.

030788743X|4.0|This was the most fun I've had with a sci-fi book for quite awhile - the pages flew by, and that's a good thing.  Sometimes I just need something to escape into, rather than some heavy intellectual exercise.  Growing up in the 1980's made this even more fun for me - it brought back a lot of good memories.  Ready Player One was definitely a love letter from one nerd to all others - and I appreciated it deeply.<br /><br />All that said, I can't give the book a full five stars - and I'd be hard pressed to put my feelings into words on this.  But, it being a review, here goes nothing.  In a lot of ways, this book reminded me of a less-complex Snow Crash, by Neal Stephenson - and suffered from some of the same flaws.  In the end, a five star book needs to make my jaw drop, and be wrapped up with an ending that makes it fall off.  While Ready Player One had a more cohesive, sensible ending than Snow Crash, I never felt my jaw drop throughout the book (Snow Crash has a few jaw-droppers - if you haven't read it, get busy doing so).  Granted, there were some clever points, which I appreciated, but most of the time my jaw was busy grinning at the humor, and the nudge-nudge references that would raise a smile from any good geek of my vintage.<br /><br />Also like Snow Crash, the characters never seemed to develop in any truly unexpected ways.  The major conflict in this book was a pretty standard love story - and while it was well-done and I felt emotionally attached to the characters, I kept expecting a little more challenge from them.  Without granting spoilers (which I hate), this is tough to get at, but something inside me kept waiting for a couple of the characters to show entirely different sides.  I was impacted by one plot development early in the book that showed this author is capable of having real teeth - but the major character development surprise, while surprising, was not of the same caliber of impact.  All the way until nearly the final page, I was waiting for the jaw-dropper to hit - the major twist to appear.  It never did.<br /><br />The good news is that I note all this as fairly light criticism against what I think is a fairly phenomenal first novel.  If the worst I can say about a book is that it stacks up to Stephenson's classic Snow Crash, then that's damn high praise.  So, for a four star rating I can't recommend this book strongly enough.  Read it, savor it, and get ready, because this guy has more to share with us and I, for one, am looking forward to his next effort eagerly!o hit - the major twist to appear.  It never did.

1451648537|4.0|I'm not sure when I first became aware of Steve Jobs - I certainly remember a time before the original Apple explosion in the late 70's and early 80's, when that name would have meant nothing to me (or almost anyone else, for that matter).  But what I am sure of is the unique impact this man has had upon my life, and the fact that since I've become aware of him that he has been a solid subject of fascination for me.  Not surprisingly, then, I have read many texts (far too many?) on the founding of Apple, it's founders, and it's products in my time.  All of this only matters so that I can outline a context for my review of this biography.  It is important to note that any fascination that I have for the subject of Steve Jobs should not be confused with hero worship, as a very large part of it stems from Jobs' unique and uniquely abrasive personality (which Isaacson documents with bone-level honesty).<br /><br />When pursuing Isaacson to act as the sole authorized author for his biography, the dichotomy that is Steve Jobs was on full display.  On one hand, Steve wanted Isaacson as the author, in part, because he had written biographies of other great innovators and men like Ben Franklin and Albert Einstein.  Can the word \\"hubris\\" even begin to touch the depth of arrogance this suggests?  Yet, on the other hand, when probed by the author about who was off-limits for source material Jobs was clear: no-one was off-limits.  In fact, he bluntly stated to Isaacson that he expected a full and honest coverage - the good, the bad, and the ugly.  He didn't even want to read the book beforehand to avoid influencing its tone or candor.  Fully aware of his own warts of personality, he felt it vital to allow this work to speak with full honesty and integrity to the truth - a subject that Steve Jobs was famous for having difficulty with.  Whether Steve Jobs was a great man, or not (I think he was), is a subject for debate.  That he was a deeply complex man, is almost beyond dispute.  In the years that will follow his passing, time will provide perspective on Steve's life, and his accomplishments.  Isaacson's book will provide a good starting place for that perspective.<br /><br />The biography, itself, is an enjoyable read - Isaacson's prose does not distract from the subject, is clear, well-crafted and pleasant to take in.  Even having read as much on this subject as I have, I still found the book full of little bits of information I did not know, and intimate nuggets about Jobs' life.  It was not, however, a deep biography either in information, or philosophizing about Steve's personality.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it presents the facts of who Steve was by how he behaved and what he accomplished - the author leaves it up to the reader to draw their own conclusions about how it all stitched together to make the man.  Far from being a love poem about Steve Jobs, at times Isaacson even betrays some amount of dismay and disgust at aspects of the subject's personality and poor behavior (I found this to be as refreshing as it might be biased, though).  Further, there was a certain amount of repetition from earlier works (to be expected in a biography), and some areas were not treated with the depth they might have deserved - thus, the four-star review.<br /><br />Overall, I strongly recommend the book to those just starting to study the life of this complex individual, as well as those who know \\"everything\\" about the man already.  If you do know it all, then it's a nice, enjoyable trip down the interesting streets of Jobs' life.  If not, then you'll pick up some neat tidbits (I sure did).  And if you just like well-written, smooth reading prose about interesting characters, then you could do far worse than this.ears that will follow his passing, time will provide perspective on Steve's life, and his accomplishments.

B005VMVUAQ|4.0|This film was cliched, but well acted and directed. One of the few movies by JS that I haven't seen but probably wouldn't like anyway is 8MM-heard enough about that one to give me nightmares. Nicholas Cage and Nicole Kidman played the married couple on the verge of collapse when their home is invaded and have to put aside their pain in order to escape. The invaders have a fool-proof plan, or so it seems.  Is this one of Joel's best? No. Is it enjoyable? If you can get past the language, yes. Flatliners was my first movie directed by Joel, liked that too, even though when I saw it I was only 10, believe it or not, (more about that one later on). What I don't understand is why this movie flopped so badly in theaters, with the research I did, that question has yet to be answered. Oh well.

B001ECDVKE|4.0|I have to agree with some of the positive reviews for this film. I watched it in theaters and found it a riot. I was 16 then, my mom despised it, but even she found a couple scenes funny. I just turned 31 in September, and I still like it, overall. However, the so-called joke only works for so long, then it gets a tad tired. Luckily director TB keeps the pacing at warp speed, but even that won't save it for everyone, oh well. Is it worth owning? If you like warped comedies, definately! I finally reconciled with it and bought it a couple months ago, so I guess the humor worked for me too! But don't watch it expecting realism, cause you won't get it.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The title says it all. Jason Bourne was cool in standard definition, but in high definition sound and video, he's amazing.
B0036TGSRG|5.0|I love this film, but I'll confine this review to the technical aspects of the Blu-Ray.  Sadly, this American Summit Blu-Ray has all the cursing very poorly redubbed in order to get a PG-13. There are probably 15-20 instances of redubbing, almost always showing an actor in closeup, with their lips moving very obviously to other words.  Trust me, the cursing helps the film enormously. The replacement words are unintentionally funny and dull the impact of those scenes - the cursing is a vital aspect of the characters.   Luckily, there is a Canadian Blu-Ray with the exact same transfer of the film and the exact same extras. Indeed, I suspect it is an identical disc, as my Blu-Ray player thought it was the same and started at the same point in the film.   The only difference is that the Canadian disc, mercifully, leaves the cursing untouched.   It can be found at the Canadian Amazon site. It is from E1 Entertainment and is easy to distinguish by its bilingual packaging. It's a bit more expensive, but believe me it's worth it.
1451648537|1.0|I genereally dont write reviews but after reading this book I was compelled to write :   1. I found him a thourouhly idiotic guy with lot of ego  2. Enlightened CEO was a foolish notion he had; with that kind of ego, obsession, desires and shrewd political mind certainly he was not enlightened in any sense  3. Reality Distortion ; Even so called mad people have these kind of reality distortion field the only difference is they are not mystic  4. He never really understood the phiosophy of life especially Buddha; otherwise he would have not tortured himself by not eating  5. He was not at all a happy person; throughout his life he suffered from obsession and it is a pain rather than quality   6. At times author tried to show the good side of him; the trouble is how can one be good without being good;

031603441X|3.0|Generally interesting. How could it not be? I was fascinated by the influences Keith talked about--surprising ones like Count Bassie. But on the flip side, there were long passages where Keith just seemed to ramble. Not surprising, I guess. But at times it was like reading an account by any old grandpa of the old days. For Keith being who he is and was, these are some pretty interesting old days to reminisce about. Worth reading, but not as good as I expected.

1416550550|5.0|What a wonderful book. It's filled with interesting characters and a plot that filled 500+ pages. The Forgotten Garden is in a league with such classics as Rebecca and Jane Eyre and deserves to be read for many years. The author's writing is always clear and well-paced; her ability to keep three stories all moving in the same direction without ever letting anything lag is remarkable. To the author: thank you -- and write more please!
B005W3G2D4|5.0|I absolutely love love love this album. This is like the stuff she did in the beginning. I missed this Kellly so much, and will be listening to this album over and over again with my ipod. I adore Kelly Clarkson and this new album may become my favorite. I love love love Mr. Know it all. Great Album, and I bet you cannot listen to it without a few tears here and there. She just has so much emotion in her voice, and she simply amazes me.
B0049MAXQG|5.0|I seen the original version in the theaters back in the '70s.This one,with deleted scenes restored,made seeing it seem like the first time.I'm a fan of Linda Blair and I love her work,giving the movie some beauty to contrast the ugliness of the story.I never knew there was a part that has a death of a friend of the mother.Great movie that gives a more in-depth look at the subject with the missing scenes.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|A band that was amazing has become a joke. This is a waste  of money if you buy it. Who cares about lou reed, Metallica seemed  to be coming back with Death Magnetic, but this sets them back far enough to say  i think they suck now for real. This is one of the worst albums ever made.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been an avid reader all my life. I have read and enjoyed a variety of authors...from Louisa May Alcott to Victor Hugo. I have read and enjoyed most of Stephen King's Novels and short stories through the years since his first book, Carrie, in the early 1970's. A few of my favorite books have been written by Stephen King, and I think this is going to be one of them. I remember vividly where I was the day President John F Kennedy  was assasinated. I was 11 years old, and sitting in my 6th grade classroom when my teacher was summoned out of class. When she came back, her face was ghostly  white as she told us our President had been killed. Since  then, I have read about all the conspiracy theories, and I have often wondered, &#34;what if&#34;? What might have changed if John F Kennedy lived? Apparently Stephen King has given this a great deal of thought as well. Much to my delight he has written a well thought out novel on this same &#34;what if&#34; thought. This book has taken me back in time to my childhood days and tapped into memories that have long been dormant. I recommend this book to everyone, no matter what year they were  born, who has ever asked themselves the question, &#34;what if&#34;? Truly  a GREAT read, and classic Stephen King!
1419702203|3.0|I understand this is a memoir, but I was expecting more information about his post-Beatle years. A good read, but it left me wanting more.
B006FE17Q6|2.0|A friend of mine who is a comic buff told  me that he stopped reading the comics after a while because they became increasingly more \\"soap opera\\" like and about characters and their feelings and relationships and less and less about the zombie apocalypse, immediate survival, the question of how it all happened and the end of the world. So I am afraid this show is headed in that direction as well. Already as it is, everything we have seen so far in this season, with the exception of the very first episode and then this episode, have been heading in that direction and if the intention of the writers is to make this show about some psychological exposé  of its characters with the apocalypse and zombies thrown in there as the incidental backdrop, I am afraid it will be just downhill from there. I am sure lots of people are interested in that kind of story line but I think for those of us who are looking for more the disappointment is impending. I, for one, am certainly not interested in a series that studies how people act under pressure. That's just too easy.    Having to wait 6 episodes to get some much needed plot reward is not a great TV show maker, it is a sure recipe for impending cancellation.   That said, this episode should have been the third episode in the whole bunch instead of drawing things out painfully long for four or five episodes to get to this. They seriously need to take the direction away from the characters' mostly petty interpersonal relationships and strike a balance with regard to  character development and trying to answer some of the tough questions like they did in Season One when they went to the CDC. I still dont understand why throwing in one of the oldest cliches in soap opera history, like the pregnancy and \\"who is the father of my child?\\" could possibly be considered clever and intelligent plot elements.   The way they have portrayed most of the characters in this season has made liking them increasingly difficult. With the exceptionof Shane and Andrea maybe, everyone there is out of their freaking minds.   First you got Dale whose preferred method of dealing with conflict of any kind is brushing it under the carpet. After first taking the gun away from Andrea and then later lying about the car being fixed so they could not move on, he now, quite cleverly, decides to hide ALL guns the group owns, so Shane cant get to them; nevermind that they are surrounded by walkers. Of course Shane is the bad guy for asking him to return them.  Then you have Rick, who appears to have suspended all reason, negotiate in all seriousness with that nut job Hershel about staying on the farm indefinitely in exchange for helping him rescue Walkers. Wow. Did he really think that they could all stay on little house on the prairie with the world gone under, a myriad of unanswered questions (see CDC from season 1) and over a dozen zombies in the barn and days filled with plowing fields and rescuing Walkers here and there? Seriously? It's also only been a week or so since he awoke from his coma. Isnt it too early to settle down already and throw in the towel? Shouldnt they be looking for answers instead of wasting their time worrying about Lori's rate of sexual intercourse and status of reproductive organs?   Finally, the little boy got more dialog and screen time than TDog and Daryl has gone from the violent, yet courageous,  boondock trash who was willing to blow everyone's brains out at the drop of a hat to sentimental, mooshy and sappy around Carol, who seems a little too old for him and whom he affectionately calls a \\"stupid b*tch\\". Huge turn off. Calling an abused woman abusive names totally made me dislike Daryl.   Shane's character is quite interesting. He seems to have had those violent and angry tendencies all along actually, only that they were sort of kept in check under the thin veneer of civilization and the rules, laws and mores that govern it. Now, all of a sudden with all those structures, if you so will, no longer in place, those traits in him keep peaking through and manifesting. I dont think he is a sociopath or even an evil and callous person like most people here like ot say. I highly doubt that if he was in pre-zombie apocalypse world, he would have shot another human being, like he did with Otis, to save himself. But in a world that's been taken over by flesh eating zombies, the same rules dont apply anymore. They can't apply or you'll die. It was either him (and with him Carl) or Otis. Keeping your humanity is important but it can really only go so far if you want to survive. Shane's deterioration as the result of the meltdown in the world is quite interesting.    Shane is still the most reasonable if you ask me and i think Rick's behavior would have gotten them killed, but you can see his mask of sanity slowly slipping and that is intriguing. I hope the writers keep the nuances and ambiguity there instead of following some trite clichee and turn him totally evil.   One of the strength of this show was that unlike most zombie movies, this looked at the humanity of it all, portraying the fate human kind was facing as tragic, illuminating the sadness of a world torn by disease. Those scenes in the first season where Morgan's child struggles because his mother has become a Walker, when Amy turns or where they have to abandon Jim who was bitten, were beautifully executed and powerful. Amid all the insanity we were reminded that the biggest tragedy is that every single human being has been ravaged and killed by illness and reanimated into nothing but a monstrous, animated corpse forever doomed to wander the world in an undead, mindless daze in what is to be the zombie apocalypse. This dilemma was central to the story line and created an unparalleled mood and somberness. Season 2, on the other hand, let the air out slowly and painfully and now, with the exception of this a couple of episodes, it has flattened out, like Lori' s chest and personality.   This show has gone from one about survival and the adventure within an unexpectedly terrifying setting to one about the interpersonal relationships of the remaining survivors. How about those iconic shots of cities and roads that are completely empty and where the signs of the apocalypse are the only things that mar the landscape like overturned cars, wrecked buildings, fires, and dead bodies?   The aftermath of the chaos, the silence, and the blank canvas of the landscape - especially city - created a suspenseful atmosphere in the first season, drawing you in and wanting you to know more about how all this happened, what is left, where the scientific community is, how other cities and countries dealt with it etc.   I dont see this show taking on a meaningful direction, however, to parallel what we have seen in Season 1, anytime soon, if they continue on the same path writing wise. It certainly is a shame. They should never have let Darabont go.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|The 1st Season of Community really shows how the show evolved. I love how you can see the actors learn their roles and start blending into the group. What can I really say? There's no reason to not get the 1st Season on DVD.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|Ultraviolet copies should not be able to have the \\"digital copy\\" logo on them. As there is no copy only streaming. This is so weak on the part of the studio. I'll hold off, and in 6 months I'll buy the Blu-Ray on Amazon for $9.99, and I'll also buy it on iTunes for $9.99 and I'll have EXACTLY what I want and Ultraviolet can piss-off. The movie is 5 Stars, it is amazingly funny.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Mr. McCreery has a great voice, this is a good sound compilation and I expect great things from him in the future.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Preordering this movie was such a good decision. It's an insanely awesome sci-fi thriller with in-depth character development, and it ended up costing me just twenty bucks for the Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital copy.
B005N95JA4|5.0|I am a huge Stones fan but I am always a little skeptical about the new ways Mick tries to squeeze an extra dollar out of his fan base.    I was also not pleased with the release of Exile on Main Street's Deluxe Edition.  You could tell that the unreleased songs that were \\"polished up\\" were more than \\"polished up\\".  They sound nothing like any of the original songs and some of the titles sounded like they were trying to create names that seemed dated (Pass the Wine/Sofia Loren).  The guitar's, Mick's voice, and the lyrics all sound recent.  Now to Some Girls...  The unreleased songs on the bonus disc are definitely from the 1978 period and sound like they were actual songs that did not make the album.  As there are more then a few that are country based, I can see how the Stones would leave all but Far Away Eyes off the album as they were trying to release an album to compete with punk and disco. Every fan always wants to believe in the \\"lost tapes\\" and these seem to be the real deal.  As to the sound of the remastered Some Girls, I can never notice the difference in quality on remastered releases so I am not one to judge.  I can say that the bonus disc alone is worth the five stars.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|Before I had gone to see this movie I did some research on it and saw the movie trailer. It looked interesting and thought I would like it. By the time the movie was over and the closing credits were rolling all I could say was WOW! To me it was an amazing movie that has restored my faith that the art of film making does still exist. Far too many movies made nowadays rely way too much on senseless violence, explosions, car chases and way over the top special effects. There is none of that in Little Ashes. Instead they rely on the power of the spoken word and human emotion to create a story that compels you to watch and be drawn into the plot. I will say it helps in watching this movie if you know a little bit about Salvador Dali and his art. The movie does a great job in showing how Dali became the eccentric artist he was. Still even without knowing who he was you will find yourself fasinated by the artistic genious some would call a madman. Robert Pattinson (from Twilight fame) gives an outstanding performance as Dali. I feel though that Javier Beltran steals the show as Federico Garcia Lorca, an up and coming poet who would inspire many to resist against facists trying to gain control of Spain and who finds himself sexually attracted to Dali. There is no doubt in my mind that Little Ashes was one of the best films of 2009. It certainly was on my list among the best for that year.
B005V20JKI|3.0|This game would get 5 stars if it would actually work. It's like the designers are genius but don't know how to code efficiently. The controls will lock up and force you to stand/jump/walk in place until a monster kills you. Ugh!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This product is a little expensive, but for me, it was completely worth the price. I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan and this remote not only looks cool but it actually works. Everyone I have showed it to is amazed by its abilities, and it is very user friendly. It was easy to program, and even the most technologically impaired individuals were able to master the use after a few coaching steps. I set it to work with my cable box, so it is able to work in multiple rooms in my house. I have not utilized every function. (13 different functions in total) simply because I do not use them.   It communicates to you once it has learned a command. When you perform a command it will vibrate to tell you if you have done the command right. Different commands have a different number of pulses.   The packaging it came in was top of the line, and it was delivered very quickly. The wand is plastic but still looks very nice. The instructions that came with the wand outlines everything you need to know about the wand and how to practice using it. After about 5 minutes of practice and programming it was being used as my primary remote. It continues to learn from you and you style of flicking so the more you use it the more it customizes to fit you best!
B004NSULHM|5.0|Short review: If you liked Pablo Honey and Kid-A you won't like this album.<br />I really liked OK Computer and Hail to the Thief, those are my favorites.  If you liked the harder, rougher side of Radiohead, you probably won't like this album.<br /><br />I am thankful Radiohead went in this direction... it really seems like they have a clear intention and joy in their hearts producing this music.  They're having fun.  I think people that can't understand or relate to that will not like it at all.<br /><br />I'm not what anyone would consider a die-hard fan of Radiohead, just a big fan of inspired music.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this set for my boyfriend's birthday this month, but it was really for me. I have all six movies on DVD, but the quality is even better on Blu-Ray. The original trilogy is as breathtaking as ever, and the new trilogy is just as disappointing (they should have just remade them with better actors... but I digress.) However, this set is completely worth buying. We watched the spoofs that are an extra feature, and they were absolutely hilarious. You also get to see parts of the movies you've never seen before, with all of the deleted and alternate endings and the documentaries. It does have a lot of the same stuff as other Star Wars sets, but you can complete your collection with the Blu-Ray set. I think if you're a Star Wars fan of any caliber you should get this, if not for all of the bonus features, then just to watch the movies another hundred times on a different system. Do it! You know you won't regret it.
B005IZLPME|4.0|I was really stunned when I saw Thor and liked it. So much hype is rarely lived upto and Captain America gave me the same feeling. Top movie with a great superhero cast in chris evans and possibly outdone by the smooth baddie in hugo weaving. In terms of the blu ray 3d it could have been better although the movie might be more 2d suited. You should enjoy
1935670913|4.0|This is a great book. I even purchased it in book form! As a new indie/e-book author myself, John Locke shares what has worked for him. Now not everything may work for everyone and no you may not sell the staggering number of books John has, but the tips he offers are invaluable.
B003L77FYS|5.0|The movie was great as usual. Castle will be a favorite for a long time. Anyone who is a fan i'm sure will continue to purchase and enjoy the story.

0062101897|4.0|After reading most of the reviews written here, I have very little to add outside of the fact that just about every single major creatures, events, sets, characters of the Harry Potter's world are presented here and how they were transformed into movie magic....except for the owls. There was one tiny page on the Owlery of Hogwarts (the set) but there were nothing on the owls, the most visible creatures of the Harry Potter's world. There are more owl scenes in these movies then any other creatures outside of humans. But there isn't a single page regarding owls of Harry Potter. In fact, there were nothing on Hedwig himself, whose loyalty and bravery to Harry Potter cost that poor owl his life. Considering the size of this book and its overall completeness, this oversight is really unforgivable. I wondered why so many other reviewers missed this while singing high praises. (Only one other reviewer beside myself mentioned this oversight.) In fact this book doesn't have any live animals, Hermione's cat, Ron's rat, only live animal mentioned in this book is Mrs Norris! Without these creatures, this book is NOT very complete as it should be.<br /><br />And the fact that it doesn't have an index is sloppy work. The book is really fantastic in just about every way outside of omission of these two elements. There is no way I can give five stars to a Harry Potter movie book that forget Hedwig and his owl companions.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I thought that what Coldplay did with this concept album was great. It was a love story that ended in a way that I did not foresee. Nonetheless, the music was good and had plenty of variety. Definitely did not feel like I was listening to the same song over and over again.

B001TH7GT6|5.0|This is the 2nd or 3rd AmazonBasics product I have purchased. Par for the course, they're great. The cables are sturdy, thick and solid. Better and cheaper than \\"high quality\\" cables you can buy at other places for $50-$150.  Can't go wrong with these.
B004WE01YA|4.0|I got this in the mail a day or two ago, but didnt want to review it until I watched it all the way through. I've only seen one of the 5 discs (blu ray NON 3D) and it worked fine. My only complaint is the fact that it said this product was brand new, and it was obvious that it was NOT sealed the way it is when originally bought. The DVD had been open and then rewrapped. I have yet to enter the disney rewards code into my account, but assuming that it will work, then it wasn't a big deal that the dvd was opened and rewrapped, because everything appears new regardless
B003Y74AZ2|5.0|I originally bought this case as a temporary cover until a decent priced Otterbox came out for the iPhone 4S. But its been over a month and I've had no problems. It's a slim durable cover. I haven't tossed my phone or anything, but it did drop about 1-2 feet, and no damage.  I may just keep this as a permanent cover.

0525423656|2.0|I had such high hopes for this series. I really enjoyed reading the first book and was disappointed in Crossed, which fell flat. I kept reading because I was hoping that it was going to get better but it never did. The plot wasn't significant, the emotion was stretched and I found it flat out boring. Generally the second book is better than the first, especially with a new-ish writer, but I felt like it was over worded to make up for the weakness in plot. Probably going to skip the next book.
B003Y5H5FQ|4.0|I'm going to skip directly to my list of likes and dislikes about the movie. Overall it was a fun watch. It wasn't a great movie in any sense of the word since the whole vampire subject has been done and redone over and over thousands of times. This movie did not add anything new, you basically just watch it for the action and the laughs, which were alright.  POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!  Likes:  - I love how the mom didn't fit into the typical stereotypical skeptical mom role that many movies portray the parents and other adults as. I'll explain. You know how movies have parents and adults being in denial and skeptical when their kids bring up subjects that make the kids seem like they're going crazy? And the parents or adults don't believe them and in the end get killed for it? Like the scene during the movie when the main character explains to his mom about the vampire next door. Now if she opened the door and they got killed for it, you would probably have thrown your hand up in the air and yell out \\"aw man, you should've listened to him!\\" Thankfully in this movie, even though the mom was skeptical, she does end up trusting her son more and did not open the door. I loved her character overall, she had an enjoyable personality.  - I was glad to see that the main character's girlfriend remained a good person throughout the movie. What gave me skepticism was when the main character and his ex best friend were investigating the disappearance of one of their other friends. His 'past' best friend said how they use to bad mouth her and call her a sl*t behind her back. So my impression was that the main character gave up his identity to hang out with people that are stereotypically portrayed in similar movies as cool, popular people that have a bad, unfaithful, basically not so cool personality deep inside in relation to their opposite counterparts in which there are nerdy or not so cool people that are actually the ones with a more solid personality and morals overall. Sothroughout the movie, I was predicting that she would cheat on the main guy with the vampire and eventually get killed because of that, I was preparing myself to hate her. However, it never happened and I actually find myself attracted to her in the sense that she was generally a cool girl with a good head on her shoulders. I kept thinking \\"wow she's a keeper\\". And yes I know how my sentence sounds like but I'm just trying to be straightforward with my thoughts so bare with me.  - I do like the humor and the other characters overall. There were no specifically obnoxious characters or scenes in the movie. Everything possibly negative was toned down or taken out. The movie contained a decent amount of action to make you stay alert. There were no horrendously unbearable obvious flaws.  DISLIKES:  1. I was not too fond of how, about 15 minutes into the movie the ex best friend yells out \\"your neighbor is a vampire\\". It sort of came out of nowhere, usually movies like these have a period in the movie where they investigate and then it'll be something like \\"ahhh haa! Just as I thought, he IS a vampire!\\" The main character eventually investigates his ex best friend's house, but it doesn't seem to explain why the guy originally thought the neighbor was a vampire. Like he video taped it but why did he start doing so? It just sort of came out of nowhere. I just felt like it took a bit out of the story. I would have preferred that but am open minded enough to take in what the movie had to offer, just a personal preference.  2. Nothing new added to the whole subject on vampires. The movie was extremely predictable if you think about it. Guys find vampire, vampire tries to kill them, they kill vampire. No good twist or anything. They did remain relatively faithful in terms of vampire weaknesses that you normally see in most vampire movies.   OVERALL:  Fun movie, just nothing new and definitely nothing to ADD to the dying movie industry that seems to lack more and more in creativity and originality. The movie industry that seems to rely too much on remakes or remakes of remakes or ideas that's already been done to death. I gave this movie 4 stars because it entertained me, but overall, it's not a superb movie in any sense of the word. It was watchable, but definitely not memorable. You get a few laughs, you go home, then it's pretty much forgotten. Nothing amazing.
B004FOA84A|4.0|While I can agree with reviewers who feel the game is a little short, it IS a $.99 game. That said, graphics are good, gameplay is innovative...if it were longer, I would've given it 5 stars.

B000JIHP88|3.0|The three big leaves seem to slow down the rotation to the point of stopping movement all together even with brand new batteries.  Ended up needing to fashion something to keep the leaves up high permanently so that the inside ring of animals would continue to rotate without stopping.  My daughter does love it, though (as long as it doesn't stop on her).
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this book and have bought several copies for friends and family.  You do not have to be a \\"dog lover\\" to appreciate this book but if you are you will love it.  You also do not have to like NASCAR or know anything about racing because I do not think I have ever watched a car race in my life and I still enjoyed the way the author used racing as an analogy for life. The book also works as a good legal story which as a lawyer I found to be very realistic and sadly all too common but I will not say more in that regards for fear of spoilers to the story. In closing, Enzo will go down in popular literature history as one of the most beloved characters and to miss knowing him and hearing his story would be the real crime.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I never knew how much I needed a pocket sharpener till I bought this one.  I was getting a new knife and felt that I would like to keep it clean and sharp all the time.  This has been great.  I even went back to some of my old pocket knifes and sharpened them as well.  I now have pocket knifes that are sharper than they were when I bought them.  Great little product!
B004ULNJIU|3.0|Two police detectives, one straight (Jason Stratham) and one gay (Paddy Considine) team together to catch a serial killer of police officers. (I'm not certain why one is written as gay, since there is nothing to indicate this other than a few homophobic remarks, written or spoken, which have nothing to do with the plot itself. It's all back story. It might have been a more interesting acting stretch, too, if Stratham had played the gay cop and Considine the straight one.) Nonetheless, both actors shine in their roles, as does Aidan Gillen as the sociopathic killer. This movie also features a fine ensemble cast, including such British stalwarts as Mark Rylance and David Morrisey, and newer star Luke Evans. The movie's \\"message\\" seems to suggest that for some crimes, rules are made to be broken. To put this another way, it promotes vigilanteism.
B004XE0P5E|1.0|I heard a lot of great things about this band so I was eager to give them a listen.  After listening to a few of their \\"hits\\" I was extremely confused...It sounded like something that the writers of Southpark wrote as a joke or something.  \\"Holocene\\" sounded just like the song in the southpark episode \\"imagination land,\\" full of bizzare, disconnected, and generally humerous sounding tones all coming together to form some sort of melody that I can't even describe.  It was as if they were making fun of someone who was depressed, and couldn't quite communicate why they were depressed.  I can appreciate the \\"rainy day\\" type songs, but this music is just so bizzare, that I don't know what to make of it.  I believe the band is technically talented, but they chose to use their talents to create something very strange and goofy.  Edit:  I still encourage people to give this album a shot, despite the fact it was not my cup of tea...just make sure you approach the subject with an open mind and don't simply jump on the Bon Iver bandwagon since there's a lot of ways to interpret this music.  I've only given my opinion above, with the intention that people will consider an alternate interpration.
B002EBDP9G|2.0|This book suffers from excessive typos, like Johnson's &#34;Modern Times&#34; book. This book manages to misspell Walter Raleigh's name and Pierpont Morgan's name in the table of contents, and more follows. Harper Collins really needs to proof the books that they  scan and digitize, particularly since books like Johnson's cost more than most ebooks. Another minor quibble: the publisher used the same cheesy clipart cover for this book as they did for &#34;Modern Times.&#34; A bit more rigor is due this otherwise well-written book.

B003AQBYUG|5.0|First off, beware that the Region A (US) version of these discs might need a player firmware update to work properly; I don't know if that's true for this region-free set, but see Amazon's product description for the US set to be safe. For me, all discs in this region-free set functioned perfectly on a Panasonic DMP-BD65 player that has never had a firmware update.   Secondly, all four films look truly amazing, and the alternate versions are interesting though not necessarily superior to the theatrical release versions.  Best of all are the staggeringly abundant extras, particularly the extended feature-length documentary films about each movie, which are intelligent and thought-provoking. Instead of using voice-over narration, these films intersperse on-set footage with extensive contemporary interview footage. You get to hear from the writers, producers, directors, cinematographers, actors, composers, visual designers, FX specialists, and so on--pretty much everyone of note except sound designers. David Fincher is conspicuous by his absence from the later interviews; he's only seen in some on-set footage.

0385534639|5.0|So there's this boy, see, and he's met this girl -- only it's not quite the right girl, which will cause some problems later. But it turns out that the right girl is also, well....<br /><br />Okay. Here's the deal. The story is a classic boy-meets-girl romance. But it is also about a long-standing bet between two very long-lived magicians of enormous power and hubris, and what happens to creative people when they start feeling used up.<br /><br />It's also about a traveling circus. Except that it's not about the circus at all, really, in that the circus is more of a consequence than a cause. Until it isn't.<br /><br />I'm sorry about being twee. But this is a very twee book, and if you have no patience at all for coy and self-conscious preciousness you will probably hate it a great deal. If you fancy yourself the kind of person who peeks under the corners of a turned-down tent, though, and especially if you seek out the company of people who advertise themselves as such, you should read this.

0062011847|3.0|...but when \\"the same\\" is as good as Pratchett's Vimes novels tend to be, that's forgivable. The title's a bit misleading, though; I felt that the whole tobacco-smuggling subplot rather quickly got absorbed by the larger philosophical/civil rights issue at the core of this book (which struck me as slightly unfortunate, as the issue itself is relatively facile, to the extent that even the protagonists largely find themselves preaching to an open-minded choir of only reluctantly bigoted \\"opponents\\"). Vimes himself long since crossed over into wish-fulfillment territory; even more than Granny Weatherwax, he's become essentially flawless (even while being riddled with flaws, including a perniciously literal demon of darkness which infected him back in an earlier adventure and here exists mainly to turn his internal monologues into dialogues). He's Pratchett's equivalent of Jack Ryan -- but that may not have escaped the author's notice, as this book in many places feels like a bit of a victory lap (and thus a send-off).

0307346617|2.0|The book is written as an interview with multiple sources which all give their account on the 'zombie apocalypse'. The interviews are arranged in a chronological order so that you experience the story through different perspectives around the world. The concept is cool, but it didn't work for me. My main problem with this book was that many of the events only occur in one interview and are never brought up again. Their is no feeling of connectedness between characters. No feeling of fluidity between their stories. At times, the book just feels like a compilation of unrelated interviews about a global event. Right when a story builds up enough suspense to keep me interested, the story ends and the next starts with no connection between the two. I at least expected the final interviews to include how some of the old characters were getting along since their experiences, but they were not there. This left me disengaged and detached from the book entirely. I have heard the audio book makes the book more interesting, however, I can't imagine how much more interesting this book can become because it bored me to death.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Came quickly was new, almost through the whole series and no problems.  Often wonder when I buy from individuals if I will really get my product in good shape and yes I did, was great.
B004LROUW2|2.0|Here I am, enjoying this book, when WHAM I jump from page 756 to 788, which reads till 802 then jumps back to repeat the same section from page 788 again. Did the Little People eat all the pages numbered 756 to 788 in the publishing factory? Cmon, Knopf.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Plays great on Kindle Fire. A relaxing puzzle game that celebrates using your brain and doesn't make you feel rushed and stressed. Zen like music plays in the background as your puzzle lays over a rainy window. You get the feeling of being warm and happy by the fire while the rain goes on and on outside. I could play this for hours. Lovely.

B000FC1KGG|5.0|A beautiful children's fantasy novel.  A gentle, open and honest exploration of a young boy's conflicting feelings regarding his deathly-ill baby sister, his parents, and his friends.<br /><br />Almond deftly refrains from answering every question (e.g., the exact nature of Skellig) or tediously driving home every symbolism, leaving room for delightful contemplation.<br /><br />Superb writing throughout.  The last paragraph of Chapter Two, in all it's starkness, is absolutely heart-wrenching.  The initial discovery of Skellig was heart-pounding, and the closing chapters heart-lifting.  I won't soon forget \\"27 and 53\\"!<br /><br />Themes of forgiveness, family love and loyalty, and non-judgmental acceptance of those who don't fit into society's mold.
B005K15SPG|5.0|Awesome edition of an already amazing album. Not as good as the UK edition, but smells better! The differences between this one and th UK one are slight- couple of different pictures in the booklet and the covers are different textures. Music is still superb and the vidoeos are stunning. An amazing album from an amazing band. Definitely worth the money.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth is amazing in this role as the Prince forced into being a King.  The acting is incredible and touching while getting a bit of a history lesson as well.  I highly recommend this movie. Will make a wonderful gift.
0525423656|4.0|I like Crossed much more than Matched.  The Society is sending Aberrations to the abandoned Outer Provinces as decoys for the Enemy.  They're being killed in droves.  That is more like it!  Show me my dystopia!  Ky has been at one of those villages for something like eleven days?  And that's a lot, considering most kids don't last more than a week.  Cassia manages to sneak into a transport and is taken to a village not far from Ky's.  (And as an aside, when I reviewed Matched, I said I didn't really understand Cassia's job, but this book made it clearer.  So, points for that.)<br /><br />First things first, the dual narration.  I don't mind it.  It doesn't bother me and I sort of enjoy being in Ky's head.  You know how I feel about male narrators.  And what I really like about being in Ky's head is that he's from the Outer Provinces, so he knows the land and you can really feel how the landscape affects him.  He thinks of his parents a lot, and he thinks a lot about words.  Words are so important in this series, and I really love the emphasis the characters place upon having their own words.  I also like that Cassia and Indie debate the literal significance of that Tennyson poem like it's a prophecy.  The Pilot is real, and he or she leads the Rising, though Tennyson wasn't referring to any earthly pilot.  In my Catholic high school, we learned the Pilot was God.  It's really interesting to see Cassia's philosophic abilities emerge, because I thought she was kind of boring the first time around.  And maybe through no fault of her own, considering how the Society kept her oppressed.<br /><br />I like the new characters that are introduced as well.  Vick is hard, but a natural leader who tries to help even while acting like he's not the leader.  Indie is strong and also knows the Outer Provinces, at least a little better than Cassia.  Indie even attempts to run away when the Officers make their first appearance at the camp she and Cassia occupy.  She's a survivor, and I don't think Cassia could have managed in the Carvings without her.  At first, I thought it was strange that Ky, with all this knowledge and ability, was surviving simply to find Cassia.  I mean, they're seventeen, right?  And they didn't know each other very long.  I know a lot of us have trouble imagining true love lasting forever when the players are only teenagers.  I know I wouldn't want to be married to my high school boyfriend.  But then I thought about it, and this is post-apocalyptic.  It's the end of the world, and these kids have experienced things we never have and never will.  Circumstances make it so they can't relate to or be with anyone else, because no one else understand them, no one gets it.  It's Lena and Ethan, Peeta and Katniss, Logan Echolls and Veronica Mars, Deuce and Fade, Janie and Cabel, Four and Tris.  There can't be anyone else.  No one else has seen what they've seen.  I think Cassia and Ky fit in here too.<br /><br />I loved learning about Ky and Vick and Indie (though Indie loses me in the end).  It was fascinating for me, and I think that is one of the reasons I liked this book so much more than its predecessor.  There was less emphasis on Cassia and Ky and more on the world and what shaped the characters.  While I like Ky and enjoy his romance with Cassia, I am more interested in how they interact with the world and how they want to change it.  I think that's why I love The Hunger Games too, because there was romance, yes, but the Capitol was what was on everyone's minds, and the romance had to take a backseat.  Maybe I just don't like too much romance in my dystopia, I don't know.  But I will tell you this: when the inevitable reunion happened, I got goose bumps.  I think Condie really set this book up right.<br /><br />I can't really talk about the ending, though it caused me to send ALL CAPS EMAILS to Ashley, who doesn't even care about this series.  I liked this one so much more than Matched because of Ky.  I noticed a lot ofpeople at GoodReads are not happy about where this book went, and I think that's because this book is very much about travel and introspection.  So while people die and there's fighting, this is more about Ky and his backstory and how he overcomes his past.  This is what the first book should have been.  So maybe that's why I like it so much.  I recommend this one, of course, but don't expect crazy adventures or sexy times in this one.where this book went, and I think that's because this book is very much about travel and introspection.

B000FQJAIW|3.0|Review of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - Two-Disc Limited Edition DVD  Review posted on 11/28/2011 by Eric J. Convery  What's included on the DVD?  Disc 1:  1997 Special Edition version of Star Wars Episode IV in anamorphic widescreen video and 5.1 Dolby Digital-EX audio.  Audio commentary by director/writer George Lucas, sound designer Ben Burtt, special effects technician Dennis Muren and actress Carrie Fisher  THX Optimizer  Menus styled after some scenes from the movie  Disc 2:  1977 original theatrical version of Star Wars Episode IV (back then it was just called Star Wars) in non-anamorphic widescreen video and 2.0 Dolby Surround audio.  Trailer for LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy video game  Xbox playable demo for LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy video game  THX Optimizer  Menus styled after some of the original 1970's Star Wars movie posters  The movie itself (4/5):  I'll give a very quick plot synopsis, since most of you are probably at least somewhat familiar with the movie already!  Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is a typical Tatooine moisture-farmboy: he does all of his farm chores assigned to him by his aunt and uncle, he hangs out with his friends and he enjoys racing in his landspeeder.  He also dreams of one day leaving Tatooine and joining the Imperial Academy (not yet realizing that graduating from the Academy would mean joining the army ranks of the evil Galactic Empire!).  Thanks to the arrival of a pair of droids, he is whisked off on a grand adventure to rescue the beautiful and feisty Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and destroy the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star.  His companions on his adventure are: the droids C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker), smug and sarcastic space smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and the wise old hermit Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a former Jedi in exile.  He and his friends must escape the clutches of the evil Darth Vader (David Prowse, with voice provided by James Earl Jones), dark lord of the Sith, and Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing), commanding officer of the Death Star.  Will Luke and his friends escape from Vader and Tarkin?  Will the Death Star be destroyed?  Will the small but valiant Rebel Alliance survive the tyranny of the Empire and live to fight another day?  If you don't know the answers to these questions, then where have you been these past 34 years???  The video quality - Disc 1 (4.5/5):  Overall, the digital restoration work done by Lowry Digital on this anamorphic widescreen release of the Special Edition version is pretty darn good.  No grain is visible.  There were no digital artifacts of any kind that I could see.  I also didn't notice any edge enhancement.  My only complaint is about the colors.  Overall, the colors are very well done and vibrant, with deep and solid blacks.  All good things!  The only bad thing?  Sometimes, the skintones are just a little too much on the pink side for my tastes.  The audio quality - Disc 1 (5/5*):  In one word: amazing!  Especially considering that this movie is 34 years old!  Lots of deep, rich bass in all the right moments.  Very well-placed sound effects coming at you from all the right directions.  And the best part, at least for me?  John Williams' brilliantly stirring music score sounds the best it has ever sounded!  Bravo to the good folks at THX for performing such an amazing audio restoration job on the movie!  *Note: Some, but not all, Star Wars Episode IV Limited Edition Disc 1 discs have an audio remixing error:  in certain scenes on these discs the music and/or sound effects are mixed so loudly that they overpower the dialogue, making the dialogue nearly impossible to hear.  If you happen to get one of these defective discs, please contact either Amazon or the Amazon Marketplace seller you bought it from to let them know of the problem.  The bonus features quality - Disc 1 (4/5):  The only major bonus feature on Disc 1 isthe audio commentary featuring Lucas, Burtt, Muren and Fisher.  There are a few dull moments (Lucas himself is not the most interesting guy to listen to).  Overall though, it's a pretty interesting commentary, with Burtt and Muren both providing some interesting technical info and Fisher giving us some juicy anecdotes about what it was like working on-set with Lucas, Hamill, Ford, etc.  The video quality - Disc 2 (2/5):  Sadly, the video quality of the original 1977 theatrical version isn't nearly as good as that found on the Special Edition version on Disc 1.  It's VERY obvious that NO video restoration was done to the theatrical version.  What we get is a non-anamorphic widescreen version of an old silkscreen film print of the movie, complete with lots of grain, muted colors, some mosquito noise, and even a little bit of what I call film wavering here and there (in which the image moves rather noticeable from left to right and back again.  Repeatedly.).  It's probably not the worst the theatrical version has ever looked, but it's CERTAINLY NOT the best, either.  The audio quality - Disc 2 (2.5/5):  The audio quality of the theatrical version fares a little better.  What's presented here, audio-wise, is the original 1977 2-channel Dolby Stereo audio track.  Overall, it sounds pretty okay, considering no restoration work was done to it, either.  The sound effects are perfectly serviceable, and the music sounds fairly good.  The dialogue is always understandable, if sometimes a bit tinny-sounding.  Overall, the audio quality is not fantastic, but not terrible, either.  The bonus features quality - Disc 2 (4/5):  Lucky for me, I still own an original Xbox!  The Xbox-playable demo of LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy was very fun for me!  I enjoyed it so much, I've already decided to buy the game!  (But, the Xbox 360 version, though!)  The trailer for the game, while nothing spectacular, was a pleasant little way to waste 90 seconds of my time.  My overall scorefor this 2-Disc DVD: 3/5  I'm kind of torn in two directions about this DVD set.  On the one hand, we're given both versions of this classic film, with an entertaining audio commentary on Disc 1 and a fun (and addictive!) Xbox game demo on Disc 2.  On the other hand, the 1977 theatrical version on Disc 2 has very disappointing non-anamorphic widescreen video and merely serviceable audio.  Therefore, I'm only recommending this 2-Disc DVD to hardcore Star Wars fans like myself, who absolutely must own all-things Star Wars on DVD and Blu-Ray Disc.  For casual fans, or those who are just starting to get into the Star Wars phenomenon, I recommend instead buying the 4-Disc Special Edition DVD Trilogy set released back in 2004.  With that one, you get the Special Editions of Star Wars Episodes IV, V and VI, plus an extra DVD crammed to the gills with all sorts of cool bonus features.

0553381695|4.0|I've just finished the \\"Clash of Kings\\" and am ready for the 3rd book in the series.  As other reviewers have stated this is adult science fiction with just the right amount of fantasy.  Consequently it generally is more like a traditional novel.  I only gave it 4 stars because as the many royal houses took sides and fought each other, so many characters were introduced only to be written off, and it was hard to keep track of them all.  Thank god for the list of characters at the end.<br /><br />The book has several main characters who move the plot forward.  These are great characters and their development is well done.  They absolutely hook you into the story and it's hard not to love or feel sympathetic to them all.  The Imp, Tyrion Lannisater, is a wonderful and his words often make me laugh out loud.  But note,  the characters are in different places, apart from each other, and provide different points of view as to what is happening.  Therefore as you finish one chapter devoted to one character, the author jumps to another to move the plot along, leaving you feeling somewhat stranded.  But not to worry, the next character's story is one your glad to read more of and soon captures your interest.<br /><br />The story is often dark and given the many battles fought a bit gory.  But I've learned to skip over these parts (I'm a woman) and read just enough to know where the things are going.  But it's not all dark and actually ends on an uplifting note.<br /><br />I recently had foot surgery, so I have had lots of time to read this book.  I think in doing so I was better able to enjoy it.  It's just not the kind of book to pick up and read a bit here and there. It's too easy to forget what's going on.  In other words this is a book to become totally immersed in.<br /><br />I really liked the story and characters and found it addictive. It's been a long time since I found a book I couldn't put down.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing how HBO handles this wide ranging storyline.

0439023513|1.0|The first two books gave me the sense that the author really enjoys setup. The first two thirds of Hunger Games and Catching Fire were very engaging. She poured detail into the setup and did a fantastic job of building anticipation for the games.   When the games finally made their appearance. All the clever transitions from one scene to another were muted. Katniss' survival could be entirely attributed to luck. It seemed as though the author had the points that she wanted to make and just filled in action to get there.  That drive from beginning to end, hitting all the plot points but lacking any cleverness or passion describes all of Mockingjay.  TLDR: The book sucks, don't read it.
0823003035|4.0|This loses a star only because of its misleading title.  This is not a compete guide to figure drawing.  It is a complete guide to one particular method of figure drawing.  It's a method I find very appealing and the end result is quite beautiful, but it is by no means the only way to draw a figure.  That being said, for what it is this book is an exceptional instructional tool: a well-written, lucid, gorgeously and lavishly illustrated description of a traditional, painstaking, unhurried approach to figure drawing.

B0052RCX0G|1.0|I'm very disappointed.  This book looks really interesting and I would love to get it, but the price is just ridiculous.  Although I can appreciate that those that purchased it say that it's worth it, I think they are just trying to make themselves feel better.  No paper, printing or shipping costs; I just don't know how the publisher can justify $30.  I'll keep checking back, but I'm not going to bite until the price is more reasonable.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|I still have too much respect for Metallica to publicly write what I really think about this record. Also, let's not forget Mr Reed's alleged past contributions and his age and let the cool heads prevail. But make no mistake - this record is one of the worst albums that exist.  When an artist is established enough, he may sometimes decide to produce and sell any random stream of sounds, experimental noise, for whatever reason they think they need to. Even if it was meant as a joke, there will always be people who will rationalize and praise that work as brilliant and free expression. Those who disagree will be regarded as not sophisticated enough to appreciate it. The value of such work is in celebrity - not in the content. Or perhaps those people genuinely like said combination of sounds for whatever reason they think they do. Let them.   If you care about good music, there are plenty of honest good works released this year that really deserve attention. Tom Waits with \\"Bad as Me\\" and Megadeth with \\"Th1rt3en\\" are all perfect examples.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|This developer must not be happy about having been a free app of the day. When I open the app, it tells me there is an update available. If you try to update, the app leads you to their website and tries to get you to pay for the update that is available in the Android Market.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|The Kindle Fire already supports PDFs natively (and much much faster rending time too!).   If you are trying to use PDF files larger than the 50mb cap that emailing documents to your Kindle has, then plug your Kindle Fire into your computer with the USB Cable.  All PDFs must be in the Documents folder.   This next part is important: The Kindle Fire cannot have PDFs within sub-folders inside of the Documents folder (like previous Kindles allowed).   The PDF files will be located in the Docs section of your Kindle Fire for easy & smoking fast viewing.  To zoom just touch two locations on the screen & spread your fingers out (in to zoom out).   This App is designed for non-PDF supporting Android devices, NOT Kindle Fire.
0446547654|4.0|Another great one from Nicolas Sparks.  I could not put it down.  The characters in the book makes me want to see the movie.
B000001FOS|1.0|I can't believe all of the rave reviews this CD has gotten!  If you were around when this one came out, surely you remember that it was a colossal disappointment. Yngwie put out 3 good albums (Rising Forcing, Marching Out and Trilogy) and then unfortunately Odyssey was born. If you want to see for yourself how bad this is, might I direct your attention to \\"Heaven Tonight\\"?

B004I744AS|5.0|Great app, very useful for finding definitions with clear descriptions, images, and links to related terms. The best I have used yet!
085786078X|5.0|This is the third book by Simon that I have gotten, and I love each of them. The art work is so simple yet so real. The cats seem to be studied and drawn from life...the looks, poses, situations. I was hooked on the email cartoons and the books do not disappoint.  This is the best so far. I will get all of your books in the future.
0385535139|3.0|If you like John Grisham, for whose writing I have a taste for now and again, then this is pretty normal for his style.  But it is not a thriller, nor is it a courtroom thriller that one would expect from a typical John Grisham title concerning the law.  It is good however about a tiny law firm getting in over their heads with the tort boys who later backed out of their agreement with them and leave the law firm facing serious charges over a case.  I didn't like the beginning but it proved to be a fairly good read.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|If you are into comics as a child you will love the movie I watched it 5 times 1st day still want to see it...
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I actually was not interested to see this movie and tagged along --- then ended up being the one who liked it most.  I am not a huge fan of some of the actors and am not a Thor comic book fan per se but I like other comic book heroes, sf/fantasy, mythology, and Shakespeare and this story delivered all of that.  Tom H. as a sneaky and clever Loki driven by feelings of inadequacy (I am not a psychologist but there's my take) got my attention and my sympathy and stole the show but Chris H. was a great counterpoint as a sort of simple-minded, golden-boy who has to grow up and deal with troubles he has never had to face in all his charmed life.  The characters and plot had depth thanks to Kenneth B. as director --- had no idea he could take Shakespeare off-planet.
B004LWZW42|3.0|If you grew up with the comic books of xmen you should know all this but for the uninformed , this is a must.  Slightly boreing but does have info most people need to love the x men
B0064J6OMO|3.0|I liked the actors but overall this was a miss for me.  Had a couple of laughs in there but nothing truly memorable.
B003L77FYS|5.0|They are great to order from, and have reasonable prices. I'll use them again. I suggest you use this place if you want a good deal.
B005LJITS0|3.0|I had only heard really bad things about this movie so perhaps I am a result of lowered expectations.  That said, I enjoyed this film.  Ryan was ... Ryan.  He usually plays a smart mouth character and his lines --- or delivery --- are often corny or cheesy with a straight face and he is charming enough to carry it off.  I think perhaps people were expecting something a little more serious or straight action hero, I am not sure.  The off-planet scenes are harder for the average audience to relate to since it is all CG (a problem with any sf/fantasy all CG movie) but I am a huge sf/fantasy fan so I can handle.  Overall, not something I want to watch over and over but I liked it just the same.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had been an avid King fan since Carrie, but stopped reading him years ago because it felt that he had become a book mill -churning out books because he had to.  I loved this book...his best since The Stand.  Welcome back, Mr. King!
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I rented this primarily because I like Steve Carell but I don't necessarily always like his movies.  A lot of times, comedies these days like to use squirm-in-your-seat, make-an-idiot-of-yourself, embarrassing moments for laughs (case in point, the bar scene with the \\"cuckold\\" monologues) and always have a drag out horribly unfunny downturn at the end before the happier ending wraps up the loose ends.<br /><br />While this has all of that, there was much less of the squirming moments --- there were a lot of moments that could have been but the plot set up for them so well, you could understand why they went there and was not awkward or forced so you asked \\"why are they doing this? Is it just for lame laughs?\\"--- and a mercifully shorter downturn at the end than other comedies.  The plot managed to surprise me at times and made me laugh a lot more at the just plain funny moments than I had in a long time with a movie.<br /><br />While I could understand Julianne's character being conflicted and facing a mid-life crisis, at the same time, she was hard to like since wishy-washy is just plain hard to sympathise with no matter how justified.  The romance of the film was largely Steve and Ryan's characters' bro-mance and helped carry a story where romantic love has been shown to be an uncertain thing.  The story portrays no unrealistic promises, just leaves you with hope.
B0000009XP|5.0|This is one of my favorite Buddy Guy albums,and one of the best in the Blues genre in my vast collection. Buddy Guy, is also one of my  favorite guitar players of All-Time.I would in fact,rank this cat up there with other legends in the game such as:Jimi Hendrix,Chuck Berry,T-Bone Walker, and B.B.King. On this album,Buddy really displays incredible muscianship. His vocals are awesome as well. He doesn't get the proper recognition as a great vocalist. And the band,(which also included his brother Phil on rhythm guitar), is also really tight and on time. Buddy's solo's are so deep and passionate, that you can literaly hear his soul coming out of his finger tips and into that guitar that he is playing.He is just hot as hell on this classic release on the great ALLIGATOR record label out of Chicago,IL. His grunts,laughs,and moans on these songs, are coming from a cat that is actually feeling what he is playing,and let me tell you people,some of these tracks are downright sweaty and stanky! My favorite songs are:\\"I smell A Rat\\",\\"Are You Losing Your Mind?\\",\\"She's Out There Somewhere\\",\\"Outskirts Of Town\\", and \\"When I Left Home\\". Buddy Guy, really goes:\\"Stone Crazy\\", with his far-out guitar playing on that last track! I consider myself a serious Blues fan,and this album displays some of the best Blues-Rock playing that you will ever hear period! I highly recommened this record for all serious collectors in this genre of music.
B004SF30HI|5.0|My 3-year son loved the movie and loves the album even more. We've owned the album for about 3 months and it's still a hit with him and his play friends. I also use the music for my toddler music & movement dance class and the toddlers personally request \\"Rio\\" every week. I also love the music for my personal music mix.
0307269752|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an entertaining and often disturbing thriller. The central mystery of the book, that of a girl who disappears in the mid-sixties, was crafted well and the clues laid out carefully for the readers to bite their nails as the protagonists uncover them. The titular character is certainly a unique investigator. It will be hard for her to not leave a mark on the reader, especially, I suspect, those who complete the entire trilogy.<br /><br />This is a very dark book. The subject matter that becomes exposed as Blomkvist and Salander investigate the disappearance of Harriet Vanger includes serial murder, sadism, rape and sexual abuse. This is not by any means a book for the faint at heart or anyone who is unprepared to confront the fact that these evils do exist in the world.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book. It takes a while to introduce all of the necessary information in the beginning, and lingers maybe 50 pages longer than it should. But overall it is a worthwhile read if you enjoy crime novels or unique characters like Lisbeth Salander.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Sooooo glad I ordered from Amazon!!! :D it was cheap and a great series!!! My mom will love it as a gift!
1451648537|5.0|Fascinating, intimate, real and oddly inspiring. Highly recommended if you love tech, live in the valley or like Apple products. Don't expect to like Steve too much after this. I liked the fact that the book didn't sugar coat anything. I was real and down to earth. The many many stories are bound to become part of the tech lore.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I love this series and to get each season for such a small price and brand new! INCREDIBLE!!! Thank you Amazon!
B004I8WD7S|4.0|good product. nothing to complain about. haven't dropped my phone yet so can't say how much it protects it against a fall. but not too big and bulky. i don't have a dock so no sure if it would fit. i think so. works for me.
B001CDR1FG|5.0|Hulk, the first movie, was a giant step up from the series. The charater of the Hulk is computer generated over that of a muscle bound actor with a fight wig. The special effects were par for todays movies. It was enjoyable to watch, though his father was one big nut case. I liked it and would recommend it to others.
B001TKK3O8|5.0|I will never understand how a movie like this - one of the best of its kind - gets 3.5 stars and something like Slumdog Millionaire gets an Academy Award lol.
2290311782|4.0|This is a recent collection of short stories,of which most have a twist in the tail. The French is up to date with a considerable use of slang. Very witty anecdotes are sprinkled with hometruths. The only downer is that the back of the book shows a price of 4.80 euros (about $7) but it costs $15.15 from Amazon !!

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|To me, this replaces the 2004 movie version.  I absolutely love the cast.  Sierra Boggess sounds beautiful and gives Christine depth.  I love the way she does \\"Twisted Every Way\\" portraying absolute fear.  It's riveting. Ramin is just as good as the Phantom and their last moments together in the Finale with Christine singing \\"All I Ask Of You\\" definitely was played with \\"Love Never Dies\\" in mind.   The costumes look gorgeous and I love the digital projections.  Yes, when it get's close up you can see the pixalization of the screens but it didn't bother me at all.   This is the way a concert should be done.  It reminded me why I used to love this show and it made me love the show again.  P.S. you get a preview of scenes from the upcoming Blu-Ray of \\"Love Never Dies (about a minute).  Although, I'm not a total fan of that show, the clips look amazing.  I can't wait to see it!
031603441X|2.0|With the help Keith had writing this too long story of the human ego blown out of proportion by fame, I was very disappointed with how long it was. This is the story of what you'd expect, of a rock band that had it's beginnings in the 1960's, when an original thought still existed in music. I think Richard's thoughts are too rambling and clouded by drug use for this book to be enjoyable. It could have been great. The story has great bones, but it really misses out in it's readability and it loses momentum quickly. If the book had not started out with a fast forward in the future, during a drug bust in southern US, I would have put it down from the start. A good editing and sorting out of the story would have done this book wonders. I think what was so completely shocking in this book, was the fact that it seems like an affirmation of Keith's gargantuan ego, and what that can actually propel a man to do in the in the world. I was sad to see what he did with his fame and fortune. He could have really made a difference in this world. Instead, he became a drug user, womanizer, and just a horrible person in general. In the book, he will actually brag about all of this. To this day, he will rationalize his drug use and how it fueled his daily goings-on. I personally think he is very lucky to be alive today and it is obvious that \\"once a drug addict, always a drug addict.\\"  I would say he is brave for writing this, but he seems to have missed the boat in taking any responsibility for any of his actions. Instead, this is really about a man whose ego has made him believe he is entitled to breaking the rules and having anything he wants. (mostly, what he wants are drugs) If I have to hear about how \\"pure and pharmeceutical\\" his drugs were, one more time... Okay, we get it Keith, your drugs were sooooo good!  He spends pages and pages on just talking about taking and obtaining drugs, and it's not even interesting, with the short sentence structure and run on stories. I did like the pages which described the humble beginnings in his life. You would think he should be grateful for what he has, but he seems to want only more drugs, more false friendships based on drugs, and more notoriety for writing the Stones' song riffs. I am surprised that he allowed Mick Jagger to take credit for song writing. It was sad that he doesn't seem to think he had much to do with Brian's death.   Anyhow, I wish he had done some good with his life, being a wealthy rock star, instead of an egotistical druggie-womanizer. Shame that he is still so immature and egotistical. I wonder about what would happen to him at the pearly gates, if they exist.  Anyhow, the book is overall a boring read, could have been much better with lots of editing and a capable storyteller. He should leave the writing to Mick Jagger! haha!

B004IFYN2E|3.0|I bought the blu-ray and decided to watch it again tonight, and was frustrated that this disc forces me to watch about 3 to 4 movie previews, but at least I can fast forward them.  Very Odd! that Sony and/or WB would do that, especially if that occurs 5 years from now, after watching the movie the 10th time, I could definitely care less about movie previews from way back, am I right?  Good thing I can fast forward thru the previews, or else I would trash the blu-ray and never buy one again!  Other than that, the movie was interesting to include the visual scenery, with both Jolie and Depp acting quite well for their characters.

It seemed to have descended way too far into soap-operatics, with all the who's-baby-is-it, who's-sleeping-with-whom BS. I'm now glad I watched one more episode, for this was waaay better.

B005YDLJ76|5.0|Similar to the I Am...Yours concert from Las Vegas, Beyonce peformed songs from her latest album 4 at the Roseland ballroom in New York City (for a more intimate peformance). The diva definitely knows how to work the crowd and the ballroom while being backed by an all female band, orchestra, and dancers. I bought the Wal-Mart edition (which only came with the DVD of the concert) so I am solely basing my review off of the performance.   The setlist:  Beyonce performed all of her old Destiny's Child hits and songs from her solo projects (all of the performances were shortened because the main focus of the show were the songs from [[ASIN:B0050CQY1W 4]]). The DVD was intertwined with clips from her childhood, previous performances, and never before seen footage (similar to the I Am...Tour DVD). After she performed her previous hits, she went on to perform the songs from 4 (except Start Over).   Act I: The Journey B 4  1. Intro  2. I Wanna Be Where You Are (Jackson 5 Cover)  3. No, No, No (Part 1)  4. No, No, No (Part 2)  5. Bug a Boo  6. Bills, Bills, Bills  7. Say My Name  8. Jumpin', Jumpin'  9. Independent Women  10. Bootylicious  11. Survivor  12. 03 Bonnie & Clyde  13. Crazy In Love  14. Dreamgirls  15. Irreplaceable  16. Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)  ACT II: 4  17. I Care  18. I Miss You  19. Run The World (Girls) [with \\"Can You Feel It\\" intro]  20. 1+1 (with a clip from an acoustic performance in her dressing room)  21. Party (with clips from Beyonce's 30th birthday party)  22. Love On Top  23. Best Thing I Never Had  24. Countdown  25. Rather Die Young (featured clips of her portraying Charlie Chaplin)  26. End Of Time (intertwined with clips of different perfomances [one from the Glatonsbury festival])  27. I Was Here (intertwined with clips from performances to offstage footage)  Overall, a great performance from B. What more can I say? She knows how to put on a show(up and coming artists: take notes!). Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to be entertained!  Lil' Radio's Top 5 Performances:  1. Love On Top  2. Rather Die Young  3. End Of Time  4. Crazy In Love  5. Run The World(Girls)
B0065IBZI2|5.0|this is a special kinda of cd. Its kinda like kates x-mas cd. I will have to say, some of the songs could have been shorter, But , I really love the sound, the words, the feel of it. The best songs on the cd are Snowed in at wheeler street, Snowflake, 50 words for snow, and Wild man. I can see fans who what pop music might not like this, but, it has a wonder and beauty all it's own. It reminds me of winter and snow. but it has a heart about it thats warm and soft. I LOVE IT. come into the cold and the chill of winter. the drifts go on and on forever. 51 words for winter? ask kate. marry x-mas.

B000FA6720|4.0|I took this book for just what it is...a work of fiction. It's not real, so I didn't feel the need to pass judgement on the characters. It's a story that some will find entertaining, others won't. This book brings to mind an old song that goes something like: it's sad to belong to someone else when the right one comes along. That sums it up in a nutshell. The writing is average, but I couldn't stop reading because I felt sympathy for a couple who fell deeply in love with each other but were doomed from the start. The simple fact is, you can't help who you love. This book explores an emotional (and heartwrenching) journey of what it's like to love someone you can't be with.
1594202842|3.0|Amy Chua is a very dedicated mother. I don't think I 'll ever be like her no matter how hard I try. Nor do I want to be like her. I always thought that childhood is a journey, not a race. Many times I am guilty of scolding my kids when they failed to get A. Then I have to slap myself into reality that they are trying their best, if their best is a B, then let it be. My kids are still young, so I don't know how they will turn out as adults, but I do know that they are happy and doing their best. Good for her that her kids are getting into prestigious schools and concert halls. It's superficial and I don't envy her one bit.   Not sure about what to say about Chinese mothers' theory, but I do know that the Westerners must be doing something right because people from all over the world are flocking to USA, not Asian countries to pursue their academic excellence.   P.S. I am a Chinese mother to three kids
0553801473|3.0|I've been a passionate fan of the Song of Ice and Fire series,  just loved,  loved,  loved the first 3 books.  When book 4 came out,  I reread the first three and then dived into the fourth,  but it didn't quite work for me. I thought that this 5th book,  the putative second half of the original 4th book,  might work better. But I didn't reread the entire series and found that I had forgotten too many intricacies and felt like I was a at a party where I had to be reintroduced to all the guests who were all starting to blur and look alike.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />It took me 600 pages till I actually got into the book. That's just ridiculous,  I know, but there were too many threads I just didn't care about (I'm looking at you Onion Knight) I have to say,  when I found out that Davos would not be killed but instead sent on a mysterious mission,  I was ready to throw the book away.  I was angry that I was continuously set up to expect the worst and then it not happen.  No important characters had any natural repercussions to their actions.<br /><br />And it was a square dance,  I felt like we were just doing same steps again and again.  I started skimming through the Tyrion chapters. Tyrion!  My previously favorite character!  I hated the part where he met the dwarfette and performed with her.  Just hated the character he was becoming.<br /><br />I liked the last 300 pages,  but for no other book would I have stuck it out till then.  But for all its shortcomings,  I am hopeful that book 6,  if, when it arrives,  will get the plot moving forward again.

1596432594|5.0|I loved this brilliantly illustrated introduction to the Great Man. It spurred me on to read other books about and by Feynman; later, when I returned to this book, I saw how with elegant economy it conveyed so much of Feynman's life, his accomplishments, and his fascinating personality. FEYNMAN is a triumphant marriage of form and function.
098357670X|5.0|When I think of caricature artists that really wow me with their skill, Tom Richmond tops the list.  Last week, I received a copy of Tom's new book \\"The Mad Art of Caricature: A Serious Guide to Drawing Funny Faces.\\"  People have been nagging him for years to write a book like this, and whether it's because he got tired of it, or just realized he was ready and made the time, it was well worth the wait.  I had very high expectations, and Tom's book surpassed them.  I've bought many cartooning and caricature books over the years, and this one is hands-down the best I've ever seen.  From tutorials on how to draw specific body parts, exaggeration, relationships between facial features...I could go on at great length about all of the wonderful specifics he teaches in this book.  It is comprehensive and complete.  There are techniques and tutorials in this book that I've never seen explained in any other I've bought, not to mention valuable insights into how to become better at live or studio caricature work.  And content aside, it's quality printing with beautiful colour, too.  Put simply, I would recommend this book to beginners and professionals alike, without reservation.  While reading the book, I just wanted to pick up a pencil and draw.  Yes, I draw every day already, and while it's enjoyable, it's not often that I get excited about it.  Tom's work makes me want to be a better artist.  I've no doubt that his book will teach me how.

145551389X|5.0|I give this book a strong 5 stars, it's a great book & a great price right now. I'm not really sure why some people have reviewed this book so poorly because 99% of the photo's in this book have never been seen before. There are a lot of photo's from the Monster ball tour but there are a lot of candid shots as well. If you are a Gaga fan or even just admire her, you will love this book. There are 450 plus photographs between Lollapalooza 2010 until the end of the Monster ball in 2011. If you're looking for something sugary & sweet w/ some bubblegum pop, this is not the book for you. This book is RAW & it shows how wild Gaga can be, but isn't that the whole point? She even said in an interview that she does the blood & the gore on purpose because the public wants to see a decaying pop Icon, the public wants to see her fail so she decided to beat everyone to the punch and show it herself. Also this book is not meant to be a Sex book otherwise it would be under mylar wraps, this book is to show a candid side of Gaga on the road. I'm definitely a Gaga fan not a fanatic but she's totally awesome. You'll appreciate this book if you appreciate Gaga's style of ART. End of Story...
1569242739|5.0|For some reason I was not particularly interested in baking until I became a vegan and was no longer able to use all the typical baking ingredients (milk, egg, butter, etc). This was my first vegan baking book and I absolutely LOVE it. I have made so many awesome cupcakes out of this book. People are always astonished at how yummy my vegan cupcakes are. And since baking is more of a science than an art the author has several helpful tips at the beginning of the book on both baking in general and using some of the vegan ingredients. I LOVE THIS BOOK!
098357670X|5.0|This is THE BEST (and I know that is a HIGHLY misused statement)for caricature AND figure/facial drawing!!! i got a copy of this thru his website [...] and he is soooo talented. It is an extremely well organized and well presented guide of drawing humans. It assumes you know what a pencil or pen is, so it doesn't waste time on that. It focuses on the face and its parts, and the figure as a whole. It is so well executed, you can use it to learn how to draw non-caricatures. As a Mad Magazine artist, he had to learn figure drawing, and it shines in this book. All you have to do is dial-back the exaggeration as much as you need to. If you are either a noob or with advanced artist, you owe it to yourself to get this book (and visit his website [...] for some schooling! Good job MAD-man!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I'm so happy that they finally have this app for kindle fire!! It was addicting on iPod, awesome on iPad, and now they have it for kindle fire!
B000I5X80G|5.0|Since the Everybody Knows... album was released, I have waited to hear a live version of Cowgirl In The Sand that does for me what the original studio cut does. Ah, finally!! I would have paid the asking price for that song alone. However, the rest of the songs are beautiful as well. It is also nice to hear Danny Whitten play and sing again. Imagine what Neil and Danny would have done with a longer time together. If you enjoy getting lost in Neil's guitar, this is a must-have.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Although there was a slight difference on things when you view the start of Wolverine, it didn't detract from knowing how the Professor was supposedly injured.  However, they weren't paying attention to their own scene when the Professor goes to Jean's house the first time and he is both older and walking.    But it works along with the comics so you gotta love it.  Well played and full of action
0307477479|4.0|Very nice! The flow of the different personal narratives never get boring, but perhaps a little confusing at times. Overall not a bad book. Not in my all-time top twenty though..
B0058VW36U|5.0|A totally addicting game! Keeps me occupied for hours. A must have for high-powered Android phones like the Samsung Galaxy line.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|CD is fantastic. It contains old Christmas favorites with Buble's song styling. My new favorite Christmas CD.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this book blind: No summery to go from, no information beyond 'It's a great book!' from a friend, no idea what it was about. I'm glad I didn't bother to read a summery,  I doubt it would have done the book it's justice! The narrator is someone we all know but have never given much thought to, and has been given a whole new life (pun intended, ha). I recommend this to every book worm I talk to, and even a few that hate reading (if anything can change their mind, it's this!)
B000E1MXSW|5.0|It is just as I remembered it the first time I saw it years ago.  Audrey Hepburn is timeless. Bravo !
1451627289|5.0|The novel is of my time which is very probably why I not only liked it but appreciated King's languorous telling of a period that filled my television screen for months and defined my time. Some will no doubt categorize the novel as plodding but he captures the late 50's and early 60's and they were - emerging but not yet frantic. They were percolating, building energy for what would become the most turbulent and defining times in America beginning with the assassination of JFK. His book captures that time perfectly. Regionalism in the States was still very much alive. Deep seated racism was still the rule of the day. And celebrity, as we now know it, was only just beginning with the young President and First Lady. It was a time when substance first began to take a back-seat to the veneer.  King's novel is essentially a time-drifter however with one significant twist - time is a character - and that character is obdurate - stubborn. That idea alone I think is genius.  The book is also sentimental. To me it was just as much a love story as it was a thriller and I found this surprising and refreshing.  In this digital age I buy few hard-covers; Most of what I read now rests in the Amazon cloud. But 11/22/63 has found its place on my shelves - to be lifted, held and re-read. For me it is that important and enjoyable a book.
0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches is my favorite paranormal romance on my top 5 list.  Paralell to the Twilight series. Deborah H has balanced the romance & the excitement in a perfect way. Her language flows beautifully & it feels as if she put a lot of research into her work. The editing work was also very well done, which makes the reading more relaxing.   Really looking forward to her next book, hoping for it to be just as good.
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Get this disc.  Stop reading these reviews, stop reading my review, buy it.  Now.  Hit play.  Repeat.  WINNING :)<br /><br />But seriously - excellent selection of songs, the quality of the recording is awesome - I guess that goes without saying nowadays, but thought I would mention it - very crisp.  Excellent excellent excellent.

B005KELW26|5.0|I love this Belkin Verve Folio. I especially love the color. It is almost a dusty purple. I think it looks very well made. My only suggestion as others have also mentioned, would be for it to fold like a stand. I checked out the ones that do and I prefered this even though it didn't fold into a stand. As for the price, it seems to be in line with all the others.  All in all, I am very satisfied.
B00005JMXX|5.0|I am very pleased with the product and the service I received.....I got the item quickly and it was in great condition.
098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond has written THE definitive book on caricaturing, it's as simple as that. I have over 25 years of experience doing caricatures at retail locations and parties, and I consider myself pretty good,  but I STILL found some tips to improve my work  in this book.<br /><br />There are a few other books out there that explain how to draw caricatures, but this one is the best of them all. In clear, easy-to-read prose, Richmond explains all the theories and thought processes that caricaturing involves.<br /><br />Simply put, if you want to draw funny pictures of real people, you need to read this  book!
B005HEUASQ|3.0|You have to praise star trek always for its ambition but sometimes the plots are just so over the top that they become awkward and silly.  This is one of those episodes.  And, in trying to make the pieces of this absurd puzzle fit together, the experience is even further damaged by bizarre unbelievable twists and leaps of intuition by Picard.  C-

B006FE17Q6|5.0|This episode was by far the best one of the whole season, everything before it felt so slow, and was frustrating to watch. I only kept watching cause I don't really know how to stop the season pass. This one brought it all together, gave you the opposite sides of the coin.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Those who liked \\"Stand by Me\\" or \\"Misery\\" will like this book. This is one of those Stephen King books where he keeps the \\"horror\\" pretty low key. King delves into the \\"what ifs\\" of time travel and how it shapes the traveler, the people he touches, and reality itself. There is no \\"forumla\\" writing with this one.
B005G4TJI4|1.0|I have not received it yet am very disappointed as  I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting
0553801473|1.0|I got hooked on GOT from the TV show, have read the other books, was seriously bored by the last one, but really really hated this one.<br /><br />With regard to the prolix part, the author is seriously in need of an editor. As it is, it seems as if any random thought that pops into his head automatically makes it on to the page. Hey, so there's a banquet with a million courses? Why not describe every course for page after page?<br /><br />With regard to the vile part. Obviously the bastard of Bolton is meant to be awful, but was it really necessary to describe the way he treated Reek/Theon in such loving detail? Also the guy that had his nipple sliced off.<br /><br />Awful book. Sorry. Awful awful awful.If I could give it less than no stars, I would.
B005I64U66|1.0|Not only was the acting and humor poor, it was not a possible believable story and was in fact ridiculous.  Anniston look rough nearly naked as if she had stopped working out just to play the old lady harasser unless she has gone down hill more since her previous flick with Adam Sandler.  Then again, it is difficult to picture her as a whore type when she has played mostly wholesome characters in the past.  There was a few funny parts but difficult to picture in mind when you have images of some actor scrubbing his butt with a tooth brush....oh that DNA!....lol.  Maybe ok to rent, but would never want to own it.
B003JOA0U4|4.0|Works as good as it looks (for the most part). The latch spring would benefit from being a bit stiffer as it has become detached from the ring I have it on a number of times.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Pretty good first season. Lucy Lawless is just one of many characters you'll love to hate.  Lot's of good hack and slash bloody action. I got tired of lost love story line though.  But over all it fun to follow.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I purchased the Garmin Forerunner 405CX GPS Sport Watch for my daughter's birthday.  She has used it less than a month and it is inoperable.  The watch went hairwire and is now locked up and totally useless.  You would think paying over $200.00 and buying the Garmin brand that you would have a quality product - wrong!  My daughter tried to contact Garmin but after 30 minutes on hold, hung up.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Gameplay is just what you might expect from an 80s-style shooter (fun in short stints), but it kinda sucks playing on the Kindle Fire because the top of everything on the upper portion of the screen is cut off (score, etc.).
B00004R99J|2.0|Received the Movie today and the DVD case was broken and DVD was not stable in the package.  Case will not even close.  First time this as happened since I've been ordering from Amazon.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like that you can add your own pic as a background for the game and the game functions well does not crash runs smooth
B004MGMJ3E|4.0|Well I suppose I should begin by saying that I bought this album exclusively because I was just so entranced by Person Pitch that it only seemed essential that I bought this one. It is very different, and at first I was severely dissapointed because I fell in love with the real-world samples that tied the tracks of Panda Bear's previous album together so seamlessly.  This is not the case with Tomboy, but since I own it, I often blast it in my car when I'm just in that kinda mood.  I prefer my music LOUD, and this sounds best very loud on a quality stereo.  So granted, this album is certainly it's own entity.  If you're like me, then chill out; it just takes some time to sink in before it will permeate your soul, just as Person Pitch is an aquired taste(or any AnimalCollective, for that matter).  If you want more seamless beauty then go check out Avey Tare's [[ASIN:B0041NZNCW Down There]]. It's just wonderful, deffinately next on my list, then perhaps Young Prayer.  Enjoy alternate ambiance, always!
B002BWP49C|4.0|Yes, I saw the movie at my local theatre. No I did not go into convulsions during the birthing scene. Yes I sat in the second roll staring up at the big screen and did get vertigo briefly. Yes I liked the movie.   Unfortunately, Stephanie Meyer had an ax to grind with lead Robert Pattinson? For some reason, he got all the bad camera angles and he looked less than vampiric. Leaving the freckles noticeably visible on Roberts' back for all to see and mottled shades of unvampiric white on his otherwise acceptable physique. I dare say that perhaps Robert had a moment where he blurted out loud, \\"Hi, I'm Stephanie Meyers and I lost 200lbs. on the Nutri-system weight loss diet.\\" Reminds me why Scott Speedman did'nt reprise his role opposite Kate Beckinsale in UnderWorld due to ticking off Len Weizmann by supposedly going hanky-panky behind the scenes when Len was'nt there?   Alas, the Avatar ending in the movie really spoiled it for me. It was just as bad as Gail-ann Hurds' pathetic ending on Walking Dead where the audience is supposed to fall for a ridiculous Bambi scene as the actors so uncharacteristically get caught up in a bizarre touchy feelie moment and egg their young charge to get close to touch a fawn? Oh well, looks like I ain't watching Walking Dead anymore.   Another major turning point is the latter books made to film are more diverging from the text. This is not a bad thing given the movie pulls it out except for said ending. Albeit, these changes from the novel are minor deviations that actually add to the viewing enjoyment i.e; Bella naming her baby instead of Jacob? Anyway, can't wait till Part 2 comes out. I'm sure it's going to equal the X-men action at least.
B004LUS390|5.0|I've used SketchBook Pro on the iPad, and it's a great app. I was a little leery of how it would run on the smaller screen of my Kindle Fire, but it works very well. And if you've used similar drawing software before, SketchBook will be fairly intuitive to learn.<br /><br />I let some of the nieces and nephews (ages 8-11) try SketchBook last weekend, and they loved it. Two of them want Kindles for Christmas, but now that they've played with Sketchbook on my Kindle Fire, I know they're going to be asking their parents for Fires instead of an e-ink Kindle.<br /><br />But SketchBook is not just for kids. The app has many of the features and options that you would expect in much more expensive software.<br /><br />Overall, SketchBook is one of the best apps that I've tried in the Amazon Android app store. And it's a lot of fun to play around with.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|Had a terrible smell when it arrived that is still slightly present two weeks later.   It's very light and not particularly durable. However, I have no doubts that it would protect my Kindle during a fall.  As other reviewers have stated, the Kindle fits particularly snug. Not too bad though--I'm a little worried the zipper might scratch its edges, but that hasn't seemed to have happened so far.   I like the color scheme of the charcoal case and the leather strap is quite classy.   One thing I really dislike is that the case is made out of some kind foam that creases when you fold it. These creases are permanent and do not go away. It kind of bothers me that the case will never be perfect again.  Also, this is way overpriced. It feels like it's worth $10 but costs $30. Search elsewhere unless you're particularly fond of the design.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Pinball Deluxe Free is a first rate pinball game that plays very well on my Kindle Fire. There are three tables:<br /><br />1. Wild West<br />2. Carnival<br />3. Diving for Treasure (a big table, bigger than the screen, but it autoscrolls with the ball)<br /><br />A 4th table (\\"Brix\\") is shown, but it's only playable in the premium (paid) version.<br /><br />Pinball Deluxe has excellent graphics that make full use of the Kindle Fire's screen size and resolution. Colors are vibrant. The tables have realistic pinball sounds, and the ball moves and bounces realistically. The controls are simple and intuitive.<br /><br />A nice feature is an online leaderboard to compare your score with others.<br /><br />The free version does have some small banner ads, but they're not intrusive or distracting.<br /><br />The free version is good enough that I bought the premium version.

B004J1DBJI|5.0|I had used Wolfram Alpha before, so when I saw there was an app for my Kindle Fire, I didn't even have to think about it - I downloaded it immediately. According to the developer, the app is an answer-engine that answers factual queries directly by computing the answer from structured data, rather than providing a list of documents or web pages that might contain the answer as a search engine would.<br /><br />Whatever you call it, it truly works. I haven't seen another app like it for gathering a lot of related information and presenting it in text, tabular, or graphical form. The best way to learn what it can do is to start asking questions. It's certainly not perfect, but I've been amazing at how productive it is.<br /><br />It's very good at arithmetic and algebra. Type in \\"5x=10\\" and you'll get the answer x=2, plus a graph of the function. That's a trivial example, but I've seen examples that were much more complex.<br /><br />One of the newer features is the ability to show airline flights that are over your location at the moment. Type \\"overhead flights,\\" and if your mobile device knows your location, it will give you a list of flights and each flight's altitude, distance, and elevation angle. I've tried it, and it appears to be accurate for lower altitudes (we're on the approach to Atlanta Airport, so we see a lot of low-flying planes).<br /><br />One time, I needed to know the best time of day for the sun to be at the best angle and direction to photograph a project. I typed \\"sun,\\" and I got a ton of information about the sun, including a graph showing the sun's direction and altitude for each hour of the day at my location, which was very helpful.<br /><br />I don't really know what the limitations are for Wolfram Alpha, and it won't replace the other search engines that I use, but it's really useful at times.<br /><br />Note: Since this app relies on the Wolfram website, you have to be online to use the app.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I loved this television series, I watched the first season in one sitting. Although some scenes may be a little predictable, many that are not. This is a fresh adaptation of the zombie post apocalyptic world that actually has a plot line and character development that leaves me hungry for more.   I was very surprised after reading many of the negative reviews; most of which were complaining about character development and predictability. Maybe it's because I've seen more than the first season, but I find the statements \\"one dimensional characters\\" to be completely off base. I expected to find no plot or character development, (normal for a zombie/horror movie/shows), but I found a thriller with depth!  I'm half way through season two and I can only think of one character who is basically the same person as season one. Everyone has taken dynamic strides in who they are and what they believe in... Which can be expected in a post apocalyptic world.  I can guess those who said it had poor character development didn't give the series enough time. The first season is probably over the course of a month... if that long. You're not going to see dynamic changes in anyone in this amount of time. Even in this fight or flight mode they're still trying to come to terms with what's actually happening. I also think it's because they fail to remember they're watching a television show about zombies. I would like anyone to name a zombie movie that has better character development... I dare you!  Frank Darabont has taken an excellent comic book series and the theatrical depiction of the zombie post apocalyptic world to the next level... It is by far one of the best television series currently running.  I also love the depictions of zombies, their makeup artist is a genius... By far the best I've ever seen.

B006FE3FFC|4.0|Finally, this might turn out to be a fantastic season.  I was pretty skeptical after the third episode.  But this is the perfect climax at half-way through the season.  I can't wait to see how this is all resolved.
098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond has not only managed to create possibly the best 'how to draw caricatures' book ever, but the best 'how to' book over all. Thoroughly illustrated barely scratches the surface. Tom not only visually demonstrates each of his points in the art of caricature but couples it with an easy and comprehensive text that articulates each example. It is a rarity to find an artist who can explain how their decision process so clearly.  Speaking as a professional cartoonist, this is a must have for any library. Even if you are not a caricaturist you will benefit from Tom's breakdowns of how to view a model and spot the landmarks of a likeness. He's also got a helluva a blog too. I wonder if the man sleeps! :)   Make yourself happy. Buy this book.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I know many have knocked the season because it's slow.  But this is more than a zombie slasher show, it's a drama set in a zombie world.  The series makes you care about the characters.  The build up this season was awesome.  Episodes 1, 3, and 7 were the most action packed.  The others provided the build up needed for the action to move forward.  I can't wait until Feb to see the rest of the season.
098357670X|5.0|I'm no artist, but that's besides the point. Tom's book is great for established and would-be artists and for those of us fans who stand on the sidelines appreciating the talent.  And if you aspire to do your own work for fun or for a career someday,  I can't think of a better book to guide you through the process. Tom's book is the first book I've ever promoted because I felt so deeply that the masses needed to own this thing.  I've been a Mad Magazine collector for decades and even run a site for fans of the magazine (madcoversite.com).  Tom's work is some of the best of the newer Mad generation and stands very well next to Drucker, Torres, North, Woodbridge, and any of the other Usual Gang of Idiots' stuff. Get this book!

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Like most other people I was VERY disappointed to learn that the Ultraviolet digital copy cannot be used on an iPod. The only reason I buy DVDs/BDs that come with digital copies is so that I can put them in iTunes for use on my iPod and I have always been willing to pay a little more for that feature.  I was planning on ordering a copy from Amazon UK as some others suggested in hopes that the digital copy code they include would work with iTunes, but then I saw the product discussion thread below about Flixster giving out codes for iTunes for customers who complained.  I went ahead and ordered this three disc combo and crossed my fingers.  My disc set arrived yesterday and I immediately sent a message to Flixster customer support at support.ultraviolet.flixster.com saying that I was disappointed that the Ultraviolet digital copy cannot be used with my iPod and gave them the code for my digital copy that was included in my disc case.  In less than 5 minutes they responded with an apologetic form letter that included a code for an iTunes copy of the film.  My movie is downloading into iTunes as I write this review!  I am not happy about the push for Ultraviolet digital copies, but I am very pleased that Flixster has been so quick to respond to customer complaints and is going the extra mile by giving out iTunes codes.  They will also still let you use your code for your Ultraviolet copy if you want. In regards to the film itself, I thought it was a great finale to a much loved series. Of course it wasn't as good as the book, but what movie ever is?  I really appreciate how much effort was put into the production of these films.  The sets are fantastic and there is so much attention to all of the little details that make these stories so wonderful.  There is no way that everything from the books could ever be incorporated into film, but it is so much fun to see the stories brought to life on screen.  I can't wait to share both the books and the movies with my childrenwhen they are older!

B005MP28B2|5.0|Should one want to know the meaning of Life, one has to deal with \\"perspective\\" otherwise one is not even able to frame reasonable questions, let alone arrive at any meaningful conclusions.    \\"The Tree of Life\\" takes the \\"Job\\" approach to perspective (as in \\"The Book of Job\\").  Our problems (and accomplishments), accurately represented by the movie's characters, approach zero magnitude in importance relative to the enormity and vastness of time and space along with the Grand Design responsible for them.  The movie overwhelms us with the magnificence of the universe, and by doing so attempts to properly remind us of our place in it.  When such an impossible task is undertaken, the best that one can do is to try to portray the unportrayable, and hope that the resulting failure will nevertheless be enough to trigger the awe and wonder desired.  We are cinematically reminded that whatever significance we may have is entirely limited to our infinitesimal part of a virtually infinite whole, and artfully prodded to reconsider what is important.  One can certainly argue that the movie bites off more than it can chew, but to do otherwise would be to abandon the subject altogether, an unacceptable alternative.  \\"Tree of Life\\" is a triumphant success, a welcome change of pace from the endless car chases, bad dialog, non-stop pointless violence as entertainment, and stereotypical gangsta shoot-em-ups we are accustomed to.
B000001DTM|5.0|I really like Achtung Baby!  It is as much a landmark album (or CD) as was The Joshua Tree, which CD really made U2 superstars.  Achtung Baby has been out quite a while, but it has lost nothing in creativity and appeal.  If you are a U2 fan, you must have this CD.
B002T9H2LK|4.0|Although violence as entertainment is not my cup of tea, violence against the violent is a horse of a different color.  Quentin's suggested retributional methods for the handling of Germany's right-wing extremists might just give pause to some of today's, there and elsewhere.  That can only be a good thing.  No one can (sanely) deny Tarantino's considerable skills as a filmmaker.  Those skills are unquestionably on display here.    All of the actors turn in great performances, with Til Schweiger  not getting enough attention for his visual portrayal of what is perhaps the most intimidating German soldier in movie history.  Luckily for the Inglourious Basterds, he is one of them.    If one knows beforehand that the movie is fantasy, sort of a WWII fictional wish-fulfillment, they will enjoy it more.  Another \\"Valkyrie\\" it is not, but, of course, it was not meant to be.
B005LCECU6|5.0|Bought this within a few days after seeing it posted on Amazon and ordered it from a vendor in the UK. Wish I had waited a bit longer as the prices have come way down.  I'm not an expert when it comes to the technical aspects of recording music, sound quality etc. as reviewed by others, but as a big Rush fan who owns every studio, live and compilation album, I had to have this one and was not disapointed.  Found myself cranking this one loud and loving that raw hard classic early Rush sound.  Loved hearing Fancy Dancer and Garden Road for the first time as I believe these songs were never previously released.  I can only speak for myself and I really like this ablbum!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very pleased with this application.  It wakes me up every day.  Only recommendation is a bit more selection regarding available sounds.
1933952806|5.0|This is a wonderful book that has taught me so much about my camera. There are already a ton of reviews on this book so all I want to do is add my two cents in giving it 5 stars.  This book will teach you everything you need to know about your D7000, and in the process will also teach you a few things about photography.  I like it so much I also got the D90 book for my fiance.
B000069AUI|5.0|Wow, Coldplay rocks in this album. The songs are amazing and as a fan, you will be pleased. If you are not a fan, well you will still will be pleased. It is a very good cd.

B0000062GK|5.0|Joe Satriani has many c.d.'s out there some of which are very good and some of which are just good.  This one is very good, and is one of my personal favorites.
B0029O0BLS|4.0|I did not read the novel this film is based on. So I did not have any preconception of what to expect from the story.  I watched the film only knowing that the main characters are going to study an 'alien' craft that crashed on Earth.  In a good way the film was not what I originally expected. Without giving away the story, you kind of get thrown in another direction of what you expect based on the first 1/4th of the film. The story is good, and intriguing. Character performances are good here and there, some characters lacked personality and some didn't. Dustin Hoffman does a good job as a believable shrink, while Samuel L. Jackson doesn't play the most believable Mathematician, but he does a job good aside from that.  The film actually made me jump a few times, it has a lot of horror elements to it that I did not expect at all. The film also has a wonderful atmosphere of solitude and silence. The crew spends the majority of the film over 1,000 ft underwater in a underwater base; this magnifies the suspense in the story.  Character personalities could have been fleshed out more, too many of them seemed dull and not real. That would be my only complaint. The cinematography is well done and the movie looks great on blu-ray.  My final thoughts:  It was a surprisingly good film, not what I expected from reading synopsis and mostly negative reviews. This film definitely gets a positive review from me and I recommend it to any fan of the sci-fi, space, deep sea or horror-suspense genre.
B00000JQFM|3.0|Joe Satriani had some great c.d.'s out there.  This one is o.k., but not as good as others.  I don't often find myself listening to this one as much as his other works.

B003Y74KCK|5.0|I used Case-Mate Barely There before, it looks cool but when I dropped my phone on the cement floor, it chipped since the case does not entirely cover and protect the top of the phone. I switched to Otterbox Impact and love the protection it offers, but one thing I don't like about Otterbox Impact is when you take the phone out of your pocket, the whole pocket will coming out with it, the case is too much grip. This AmazonBasics silicon case seems offer the best of both worlds - not bulky, look good, just enough grip, good price, very good protection. Strongly recommend!

B001TIQT98|4.0|You know how it is when the coin is spinning on its edge and you are waiting to see on which side it will fall: it is with that kind of expectant tension and sense of suspense that I anticipated hearing this set. I had Bernstein's Mahler cycle - not all of it: I was missing 4, 6 and Das Lied - in their first CD incarnation, from the mid-1980s, by a company that still was called CBS back then, and I was perfectly happy with it, so I skipped the later reissues on the Bernstein Century edition or the Bernstein Royal Edition (oh those water colors by Prince Charles!). Just recently I reviewed Bernstein's 9th from that cycle - one of the significant milestones in the composition's recorded history and one of the fine versions from the 1960s, although one that in many aspects appeared to me as only the embryo of interpretive things that Bernstein would fully realize only in his later DG recordings (see my review of [[ASIN:B00000C298 Mahler: Symphony No. 9 (Bernstein Century)]]). But what really made it a non-runner today was, I realized, its sonics. Although it is not something that struck me as I was first listening to it, comparing it with Bernstein's 1979 live concert with the Berlin Philharmonic on DG ([[ASIN:B000001GFX Mahler: Symphony No. 9]]), switching back and forth between both recordings to compare some particular details, it jumped at me how dulled Columbia's sonics were, at least in these early 1986 transfers. And it really ruined any intentions that Bernstein might have had, robbing the climaxes of much of their impact, smoothing out much of the orchestra's instrumental pungency. Athough bettered by the Berlin performance of 1979 (and already by the one with the Vienna Philharmonic from 1971 available on DVD, [[ASIN:B000AC5BFC Mahler - Symphonies 9 and 10, Das Lied von der Erde / Leonard Bernstein, Christa Ludwig, Rene Kollo, Wiener Philharmoniker, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]]), the 1965 New York recording was good enough interpretively to make this highly frustrating. So time it was to break the piggy bank and invest in this new reissue (which would complete my Bernstein-Mahler-Columbia collection to boot), \\"first-time remixed and mastered from original multi-track analog tapes\\", and see if the sonic problems had been solved.<br /><br />The accumulated energy dissipates, coin ends its spin and falls flat. They have. Based on the 9th, for my money, Bernstein's recordings from the 1960s now sound as good as any from a decade later or more - as good, vivid and present in fact, as his Berlin 1979 concert and as good as or even better than RCA's excellent pick-up for Levine's recording with Philadelphia also from 1979. Now Bernstein's earlier vison sounds like the Michelangelo frescoes looked in the Sistine Chapel after restoration: it can compete on its own terms, instead of being heard through, as it were, a thick crust of patina. In the Ländler the improvement brought by the Carnegie remastering is jaw-dropping. It's the difference between banging on a can and banging on a can covered by a thick layer of foam. In fact I now find the more vigorous moments of the Ländler (the Tempo II passages) preferable interpretively in New York over the DG Berlin concert, because of their extra vigor. I still prefer the extra drive in the Berlin Rondo-Burleske, but the New York sonics are much better focused (too much resonance in Berlin tends to drown some details).<br /><br />But what the new sonic refurbishment has unfortunately NOT been able to do is to give more presence and pungency to the \\"keck\\" (saucy) horns at the beginning of the Ländler (0:21), and in general to all those little details which I found lacked a degree of bite and character the first time around (try the horn's \\"growl\\" in the first movement just before the second section \\"etwas frischer\\", at 5:26, and compare with Berlin track 2). In the outer movements, whatever the interpretive, and now sonic qualities of Bernstein I, he is 4 to Berlin's 10 on the Richter scale of intensity. Try the big \\"death\\" crash in the first movement at 18:44. Sure, it is loud and powerful, though still not nearly as devastatingly violent as Bruno Walter's four years earlier. In Berlin (track 6 at 1:22), it is a deafening explosion. Or the big string outburst in the finale, measure 107, \\"fliessender doch nicht durchaus eilig\\" (more flowing, though not throughout rushed) after the long, desolate passage with tolling harp, at 13:25. Compared to Berlin's hurling into the tempest (take it a little before to get the upbeat, track 13 at 1:30), New York glides over the surface.<br /><br />Interpretively, unlike most other reviewers, I have no especially effusive adoration of Bernstein's earlier recordings. Maybe it is because I didn't grow with them in my early years, they weren't my introduction to Mahler's world. Don't misunderstand: they are usually fine and sometimes even better than that, they were great in their times, among the very best of the 1960s, but for those I know best - 1, 5, 7 and 9 - I find that they are only the blueprints for greater things to come: Bernstein's DG versions weren't always radically different, but they always plumbed deeper, and more intensely. And how couldn't they? When he made his cycle for Columbia he had, for most of the Symphonies, less than a decade of experience of conducting Mahler: he really started with the Mahler festival given in New York in 1960, which he shared with Mitropoulos and Walter, and his first recording was the 4th, in 1960, followed by the 3rd (1961), the 2nd and 5th (1963), the 7th and 9th (1965), the 1st and 8th (1966), the 6th (1967). He remade the 2nd Symphony for Columbia/CBS in 1973 with Sheila Armstrong, Janet Baker and the London Symphony Orchestra, which replaced his earlier one from from New York with Lee Venora and Jennie Tourel, but it is the early one which is collated on this set; some listeners might regret the decision, I don't, and for the 1973 remake I'll just keep my previous CBS CD-release, [[ASIN:B00000DS72 Symphony No. 2 \\"Resurrection\\" / \\"Auferstehung\\"; Kindertotenlieder]]. But when Bernstein remade his DG cycle, he had up to more than a quarter-century more familiarity (the DG fourth was recorded in 1987).<br /><br />But no doubt the Columbia cycle (it would be an oversimplification to call it the \\"New York\\" cycle, since the 8th was done in London) remains one of the best ones from the 1960s and 1970s, a fine document of its times, and an important testimony of the art of Leonard Bernstein. No question that if you want Bernstein's early Mahler, you need to break your own piggy bank for this reissue, even if you have the earlier ones. Some other reviewers have remarked, and complained, that this new set leaves out some of the recordings Bernstein made for Columbia/CBS: other than the later 2nd Symphony, the song cycles are the main omissions. But there was in fact a strong rationale of Sony for doing so: the Carnegie Hall box seeks to emulate the 1967 14-LP set, GMS 765, which collated Bernstein's Mahler symphonies to date - hence the earlier version of No. 2, and the omission of the song cycles -, but, sensibly, it adds the adagio of the 10th and Das Lied, recordings from the early and mid-1970s. On the other hand, as the LP set, the Carnegie Hall set provides an important bonus, and one that hasn't been commented upon enough by the previous reviewers (only one refers to it): the interviews made by William Malloch of some of the players who had played under Mahler during his two-year tenure at the New York Philharmonic. Unlike what the product info suggest, they were not made in 1967 but in 1960, originally for a radio broadcast that was aired on the LA station Pacifica KPFK on the occasion of the centenary of Mahler's birth, July 7 1960, \\"They Remember Mahler\\". Those interviews formed the substance of another, 8-hour long program, the Mahlerthon, aired on May 4 & 5, 1974 on LA's radio KFAC. 1967 is when Columbia published this shortened, one hour-long version, in the original Bernstein-Mahler box (information gathered from the last volume of Henry-Louis de La Grange's mammoth Mahler biography). The Carnegie reissue claims \\"first time on CD\\", but those interviews, in their original, 108-minute form from 1960, were already reissued by the New York Philharmonic in their own Mahler celebration box, [[ASIN:B000Q62254 New York Philharmonic - The Mahler Broadcasts 1948 - 1982 [RARE]]]. Anyway, they offer invaluable insights on Mahler's conducting style and personality.
0307949508|5.0|Yes, this book was better than the first. I thought the first book in this trilogy was good but this one was better.<br />As this trilogy unfolds I like Lisbeth (one of the main characters of the book)more and more. She is a survivor and the author unfolds her character more so in this book as you learn about who she is and what makes her tick. I find myself cheering for her as she goes through her trials.<br />I love the way the author also keeps the relationship going with Mikael but without them interacting physically, only by communicating by computer and finding out that he is a good friend and someone that cares for Lisbeth.<br />There are some surprises towards the end for the reader that add a little bit more to who Lisbeth is and who is related to her.<br />Can't wait to read the 3rd book and I am looking forward to the American movie version of the first book coming out December 21st.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This one of a kind story was a page turner. It was a welcome departure from Harry Potter-esque wizards and witches. The story is well told with rich detail and the photographs make the story more real to the reader. The setting is beautiful and conjures up images of Ireland and beautiful islands and cliffs. The plot wasn't easy to guess. I like that not everything wraps up perfectly at the end... the adventure will continue!
0385344325|1.0|This is my first and last Lee Child book.  I did not think the characters or the story was believable.  I am a railfan and it is my opinion that although the railroad plays a role in the story (as one would suspect by the cover) I doubt Mr. Child knows much about them.  I would skip this one.
0439023521|5.0|I'd never read YA, but I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. It took me all of three days to read through it.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a sci-fi/fantasy based in an alternative future, told in the first person point of view from the main character, Katniss.<br /><br />A large war took place that caused America to be broken up into what Collins calls districts. Each district is known for their production value. At one point, a rebellion takes place against the capital. The rebellion is put down and The Hunger Games are created. I don't want to go into too much detail, but they are a way for the capital to maintain control over the districts through fear.<br /><br />The book is a quick read. Besides being a great story, it's told simply. The characters were unique, each with their own personality based on their roles in society. Collins does an amazing job of world building. Within the first few chapters, the reader feels like they are there. They can feel the despair right along side the characters.<br /><br />Tension is created right away in the first chapter and you feel it throughout. There really wasn't any point during the story I felt bogged down, or bored. It's one of those books where you feel yourself scrunching your shoulders together. Yet you can't stop because you need to find out what happens next, or if the characters will be okay.<br /><br />The night I finished, I wanted to keep going. The second book was right there on my Kindle, waiting to be read. I actually had to force myself not to read it. No doubt I will go back and finish it soon, but I had six other books on my to-read list I had to get to.

B003TJR2HS|2.0|Needed this little guy so I could keep my Otterbox case on my iPhone 4 and connect it to my DICE adapter in my BMW.  The DICE connector is wide and flat and will not insert with the Otterbox case on the phone.<br /><br />It first worked like a charm but then it cut out and the DICE connector at the dockStubz started heating up and smelling like burnt electronics.  Luckily my iPhone wasn't damaged but the DICE connector is toast and will not charge anymore even though it will still allow the iPhone to play<br /><br />My guess is that there was some incompatibility between the DICE connecter and this converter especially if the cable your attaching it to is meant to charge.<br /><br />The converter still works on another Kensington charger, so I'm not sure what's the exact problem.<br /><br />UPDATE (12/15/2011) - I emailed CableJive and they sent me the newest version which is more square than the previous version.  They said they were unaware of any compatibility issues with the DICE connector with the older model.  I'm waiting on a new cable from DICE to see if it works properly.<br /><br />The newest version of this connector started shipping in November.  Hopefully old stock is gone and they only send the newest version out.

098357670X|5.0|I bought The Mad Art of Caricature from the talented artist Tim Richmond and I just can't stop reading it.  In the book I found great tips and detailed information from the author that uses different examples to help the content assimilation. I didn't finished the book yet because everytime that I conclude a chapter I usually grab a pencil to do some sketches. Moreover this is another quality of the book: Motivates you to draw!
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Extremely painful to watch. Boring beyond belief. Watched about ten confusing minutes of a family that might have lost one of their kids. Then about 45 minutes of waterfalls, planets and sunsets with some woman whispering stupid stuff like \\"I will find you\\". I went back to Red Box and wanted to throw it at the machine.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|I've purchased many apps from the Amazon App Store, many of them free, and many useful and/or fun, which I appreciate. This sounded like a good, useful app for me. Despite the description this app is Android-compatible, it is not, at least not on my new Vizio Vtab 1008. It seemed to download OK, but would not install. I attempted several times before calling the Amazon App store for assistance. It was finally determined this app will not work on the Vizio tablet after all. It continues to show that it needs to \\"reinstall,\\" even though it never installed to begin with.   While Amazon does their best, sometimes they miss on the accuracy of the compatibility issue. It's not surprising, really, given how many apps there are in the marketplace, and now so many different varieties of tablets. It can be a daunting task to check every feature/function for each of them. Since the app was free, no harm done, really, except for the time it took, in coming to the realization this app will not work on my Vtab.   Now I need to figure out a way to remove the entry from the download list altogether. I've tried the accepted method, unsuccessfully, and now am in search of an app to remove an app! There must be an app for that, although I've tried a few, and like a bad penny, it keeps showing up. Somehow, eventually, I'll figure out a way to get it off my download list permanently. The reason I gave it 3 stars - it may work fine on a compatible device, just not mine.  UPDATE - a check for this app on the Android Marketplace indicates it is NOT Android compatible. In the future, I think I'll crosscheck at the Marketplace, for any apps I'm interested in, to verify whether they should work, or not, on my Vizio tablet.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I have not read the Harry Potter books, & am glad I didn't, as I loved the movies. 1 & 2 was charming. 3 through 8 were just terrific! Loved the last movie.<br /><br />Some day, when I have time, I'll read the books, as I'm sure their great & much more comprehensive. But, in most cases, the book is better than the movie, if only because the book came out first, & people nitpick over what was left out of the movie, or changed in the movie. I've been guilty of this myself.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series of movies are nothing short of spectacular! Eight great films is quite an achievement! An achievement that never has been done before with so many films with a continuing story.<br /><br />I expect, ten, twenty years from now, I'll still get great enjoyment out of them, for if there is a modern day equivalent to \\"the Wizard of Oz,\\" it's \\"Harry Potter.\\"<br /><br />All the Blu rays are perfection. Get them now, or later, as this film series is immortal, where they belong!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Although this movie commits the usually worst sin in Hollywood filmmaking (voiceover narration) thanks to the abilities of Robert Downey and the writer to poke fun at that technique, it works.<br /><br />Definitely a convoluted plot that you really need to just forget worrying about figuring out and just follow the violent fun. Val Kilmer is classic as a wise cracking smartass gay (yes, you heard that right) P.I. but every character commands the screen either dead or alive.<br /><br />The whole update on the film noir genre also works thanks to its ability to integrate a wide world of El Lay landscape from Hollywood parties, MacArthur's Park, a mental hospital (reminiscent a bit of the old folks' home in \\"Chinatown\\"), hotel rooftop pools and the ubiquitous roads and freeways of the county.<br /><br />Having said all this, I would rate this more a rental than a purchase given the DVD has lousy extras--just the usual commentary track.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Okay this DVD set pretty much rocks.  And its certainly the best deal for the price.    The only place that I have noticed a less than stellar video quality was during the first movie, during the scene at the visitors center with the Mr. DNA guy....  (BINGO DINO DNA...)  There was as lot of static in that scene.  Other than that the quality was superb.  Where this movie really shines is as always the audio department.  If you have a good home theater you will not be dissapointed.  It has been remastered into 7.1 surround.  Great box set...
B0009S2T0M|3.0|The story is ridiculous and has so many holes in it, I'm shocked at the press reviews lauding it so much. Where the movie works for me is the layers that are revealed as to why this guy was imprisoned in hotel room (why a hotel room...your guess is as good as mine) for 15 years and why he's never told why he's being imprisoned. Yet this whole psychological experiment is really one of revenge from something tragic that happened back in his high school days.<br /><br />Weirdly loopy logic throughout. Incredibly dark sets. Gratuitous nudity. Hilarious English dubbing. It works on a B movie level but to think this is great \\"art\\" is taking it a bit far. It's basically a typical story found in Japanese manga that J-salarymen get off on (high school sex and suicide) redone in a South Korean setting.<br /><br />The extras are dull as dishwater usual--audio commentary track, director interview, deleted scenes.<br /><br />A rental at best.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|great for when my 2 yr old wants to play with my kindle...my 4 yr old loves all of the &quot;sticker&quot; options. I have to admit, it's just as much fun for me to play with!
B000VWYJ86|4.0|After the pedestrian 2nd flick in the Bourne series, it was great to see the 3rd (Ultimatum) hitting almost all the right notes. The last 20 minutes drags and the flashback scenes get tiresome which is all that prevents this from a 5-star rating in my books.<br /><br />This movie also shows the benefit of getting actors who can actually act in all the secondary roles.<br /><br />On a side note, where do these people get the energy when they never eat or drink anything in the entire movie? I'm just saying.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are first-rate including showing how they shot the chase and fight scenes as well as giving us a world tour of all the location shoots. Obligatory director's commentary track and deleted scenes included, too.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The movie was great.  The special features were great.  The only bad part was the format of the digital copy.  Previous digital copies were easy to download and add to library for use on PC or mobile device.  This version called ultraviolet was a pain.  Let's just say I'll check twice before ever buying a digital copy.  If it say ultraviolet then I would stay as far away as possible.  I've bought digital movies from Sony's PSN network and Apple's iTune before. They both worked great. This Ultraviolet stuff was garbage compared to the other two services.
B000OVLBGC|3.0|One thing this movie evokes is how dull life in East Germany was for both those who work for the state and those who were watched by the state. The movie also tried to tell us that this actress Christa-Maria is some sort of wonderful actress but the stage scenes at the start show the corniest of all theatrical acting. If she's so \\"great,\\" I certainly don't see it onstage.<br /><br />The movie is basically carried by Ulrich Muhe who plays the Stasi agent monitoring the eavesdropping of the playwright Georg Dreyman. His robotic movements yet his compassionate actions show you how a man so a part of the state has a humanity that many of the so-called \\"rebels\\" in East German society only play at.<br /><br />The movie also captures how dull life must have been like in the very grey East Germany. In the special feature extra the actors and director say the music played a big part in the story. I don't know what movie they were watching but it barely registered with me at all. The way Muhe's character Weisler decided to basically turn in false reports was what grabbed me more than his listening to one piece of music over the bugging devices.<br /><br />Anyway, it's worth watching to understand how crazily insane the East German state was and how so much effort was put into spying on their own people. To say this is a great movie is a stretch, though. I say for Muhe's portrayal of a Stasi agent it deserves accolades but the rest of the cast and story is nothing special really. It comes across as an art film with not enough twists to make it a top-notch thriller.<br /><br />Extras include the usual--deleted scenes, a making of, interview with the director and a director's commentary track.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|I LIKE THIS MOVIE .VERY NICE . WHOEVER WATCHED THIS MOVIE SHOULD ALSO WATCH WHEN NIGHT IS FALLING ,IT'S ART .
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Babel is worth watching as the director does a great job of interweaving the three storylines. The problem is twofold--the scriptwriter seems too be far too obsessed with bodily functions and borderline child porn. What is up with the scenes involving panties or no panties. Even a tender scene (SPOILER ALERT) of Brad Pitt helping his injured wife, played by Cate Blanchett, pee turns slightly sexual the way the scene is written/shot.<br /><br />Also, near as I can tell the movie wants to say the following:<br />1. Never give a weapon as a gift to a Moroccan.<br />2. Always have a doctor onboard a tour bus.<br />3. When taking American kids across a border, make sure your nanny is a legal alien and the driver is not drunk.<br />4. Dead mute teenagers in Tokyo are toasted out of their minds.<br /><br />Other than that, this movie makes perfect sense. Also, having lived in Tokyo for decades it captures Tokyo life quite well but in over 20 years of living there I've yet to find an apartment building with a 24-hr. doorman let alone any doorman. This was either a very wealthy area of Tokyo that has adopted some Western-style security or it's one the movie world made up.
0060558121|1.0|I so wish I'd read some of the reviews before wasting my time with this book.  I read Good Omens and adored it -- so I thought I'd like this -- went on the recommendation of a friend (love ya J but nope).  This book was so boring and in an attempt to find some redemption, for any of the characters or Gaiman, I read the whole thing.  I should have quit at least the third or fourth time I muttered, \\"I hate this book.\\"  On the other hand, after reading the first chapter of Neverwhere, I'm entertained, amused and thrilled.  Go figure.  I am not sure how American Gods won an award.

The funny thing is when you check out the great \\"Making Of\\" DVD extra, the entire flick was shot in Barcelona!<br /><br />Each character in this movie is fascinating and there's really no point in me explaining what this movie is about other than the effects of insomnia on someone's psyche.<br /><br />Worth watching but get yourself in the mood first as it's something you can't take you eyes off of yet wonder what it is that is unfolding onscreen.

030746363X|2.0|I'm not impressed. Read the TNT diet and work out plan and many other similar diets.  TNT can be found free online and it works, but like most \\"diets\\" self discipline is the key.  Why do I keep buying books hoping for a magic bullet?  This is simply another book filled with rehashed information.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles (self titled) / aka-\\"The White Album\\" (1990 CD):  OK, so what if this sounds more like a collection of unrelated singles?  There are some great Beatles singles here.  It is still a Great Album.  If you don't have it, you ought to get it.
B000ICM0YY|5.0|Recording the entire Beethoven Piano Sonatas is often considered as an ultimate challenge for any professional pianists. Many movements from Beethoven's sonatas are technically very challenging and musically even more. As a result, even if you listen same piece, the musical expressions and interpretations are totally different for each pianist. Emil Gilel's interpretation for Beethoven Piano Sonatas is regarded as the most powerful and charismatic ever even though he couldn't complete the entire cycle before he died. Listen his performances of No. 14 (Moonlight), No. 21 (Waldstein), No. 23 (Appassionata) for example. His recordings for those pieces are really passionate and mind-blowing yet very soft and emotional at some point. If you are looking are CD set for Beethoven Piano Sonatas, then I would highly recommend this for you.
B0000009RX|5.0|Frank Zappa/ The Mothers of Invention/ We're only in it for the money:  I am a fan (of most) of Frank Zappa's music.  If you don't like Zappa a little, you will probably hate this CD a lot.  Well, that's your problem.  I love this album.  With me, it strikes all the right comedy cords.  This may be a subversive masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|It's hard to believe that this entire movie took place in an elevator and a security booth. The ending was very refreshingly surprising in this time of obvious movie outcomes.
B000003BEM|5.0|The Rolling Stones/ Beggars Banquet (1986 remastered CD): This is a Great Album.  If you don't have it, you ought to get it.  One of the best albums with one of the worst covers ever.  Really, did they just get the cover and the gatefold photo reversed?  I know it is a silly complaint...disregard the cover and buy this Great CD.
B005UG542S|2.0|Disappointing. Really disappointing.Terribly, terribly, terribly terriblyterriblyterriblyterribly disappointing. When I read the book, I could see the film in my mind's eye, the great final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort so well described by Jo Rowling, with Harry holding all the cards and Voldemort not knowing it. With the magnificent twist in the tale at the end. AND IT WASN'T THERE!!! AAAAAAGHHHH!! We get some hamfisted travesty of an ending that's about as far as one can get from the book. Instead of ending with a bang, it ends with a CGI-enhanced whimper. The climax to the whole series and the film makers bottle it completely. How could they have done this? How could Ms. Rowling have let them? This film needs a remake.<br /><br />Now it is acknowledged that it's simply not possible to put the whole complexity of Rowling's world into a film for Muggle audiences, and that leaving some bits out is inevitable and will upset someone or other. However, none of the other books have been subjected to the wholesale butchery of this one. It's truncated, brutally hacked about and has a total travesty of an ending. If you enjoy the book, wait for the remake. You'll wait forever, do you say? That's not such a bad thing.<br /><br />I give it two stars for the few good bits that are there, and for the whole marvellous Rowling concept. It deserved better than this. If there are any folk out there who have read and liked the book, and are interested in seeing this, take my advice, don't. Believe me, the version you have conjured up in your imagination will be far, far better.
B00005NTJM|4.0|Jethro Tull/ This Was:  This is a good first album from Jethro Tull.  There is more of a Blues influence on this CD than on anything else Tull would release.  The Blues sections of the album are not bad in any way, but it is obvious that the band was searching for their particular `sound' when they made this album.  Once `Song for Jeffrey' started getting some radio time, it became clear that the style of that song would guide the bands future.  This is a good and enjoyable first album.  Better albums were to come.
0143034901|5.0|This book is extremely well written - and much thanks needs to go to the translator as well.  Lyrical, but without excessive flourishes.  This is a real page turner, with the wonderful theme of a character who LOVES books (who could not relate to that?), several mysteries, love stories - both gained and lost, amazing historical accuracy coupled with geographical sensitivity, and conveys the suffocating authoritarianism of the Franco regime with remarkable ease.  And finally, he makes Barcelona come alive.  Reading this novel made me want to go back to that amazing city right away - and when I do, I will be sure to use the guide that is included (a great little bonus) at the end of the book that offers you a walking tour of all the actual houses and streets that are settings in the novel.
B000000ISI|5.0|The Moody Blues/ In Search Of The Lost Cord (Ultradisc II Gold)  The Moody Blues has more in common with Tchaikovsky than with Robert Johnson, but the quasi-spiritual journey they brought their listeners through always sounded beautiful and was often very entertaining.  This is one of the many quality albums they produced.  Their music is so good that I even forgive them for honoring the patently evil Mr. Leary.  The Gold disk is very good but (as is often the case) the cost of buying it outweighs its worth.  There is a more recent remastered release of the CD with several bonus tracks added.  I have not heard the added tracks, but I still recommend that release over the now overpriced (as of 2011) Gold CD.

B005KELW26|5.0|I am very pleased with the product.  I set out to order something durable, but not black or brown.  I was a little concerned about purple.

B005P78VK4|5.0|I will start out by saying that I am not totally in love with this, but pretty close.  I REALLY DO like it and think it is worth buying, but there is one song that I can say I\\"m not totally in love with.  Personally I don't care for the way they did \\"They Don't Care About Us\\" but I've only listened to it once.  Songs sometimes have to grow on me and I think that possibly this is one of them.  It's NOT a bad rendition - just, at this time, not my taste. I can say that I LOVE Michael's ballads and they did a WONDERFUL job with them.  Michael's voice is so PURE, it's like he's singing down from Heaven.  Don't expect to hear the songs just like on their original CD's or \\"short films\\" because they aren't.  Some are very similar but none are exactly the same.  I know there was no way they would be because of the way they were made.  I heard on Facebook how Kevin Antunes had Michael's masters and took just his vocals and added their music to them.  I say they did a great job - even if I wasn't impressed with one song.  On the whole it IS A GREAT CD (well actually 2).  I will also say that I am looking forward to the Cirque du Soleil show.  I bought my tickets last March for a show next February.  Needless to say, I will know the whole musical part in depth by the time I see it.  I hope this review has helped you to decide to buy it.

B001PK5TIM|2.0|Just an all around weird movie. I rented this and sort of had buyers remorse a few minutes in. Just a lot of strange sexual imagery and blood sprays. Story seemed a little lackluster. It actually seemed like it would've been better as a manga or even a animated film, because it was so over-the-top. All-in-all, I could live with it if it was just the effects/prop shortcomings, but to me, the story left much to be desired.

0385737955|3.0|The Maze Runner Trilogy follows the dystopian arena style novels, like Battle Royale and Hunger Games. The books are fast paced and somewhat very bleak, full of teenage angst and some interesting (but a bit superficial) characters. It's a fun read, and the mysteries kept me reading up to the end. If you are looking for something in the same vein as Hunger Games, Maze Runner is a good choice.

1451627289|5.0|First off, I was born in 1951, which might explain why I so thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I finished it a week ago, and I'm still thinking about it.  If you are in any way nostalgic, don't miss this one.
B005974CNA|5.0|I honestly do not know what to expect from this CD. Like every album released Dream Theater took me a while to feel the grip of Musca, but definitely, Dream Theater is the band of the century, the slow songs are beautiful, the singing continues labrie others. Only really missed the beat of Portnoy, a fact that does not minimize the action of Mike Mangini, the band seems to be more serene, more free, not because they were attached to the portnoy for something, but why Mangini gave a freedom more other members. Imprensão that I am a upcoming Mangini put more in your face beats. But's it, once again amazing CD, it's worth.
0439023521|5.0|These were some of the best books I have ever read. It was one of the few times in my life where I literally could not put a book down and immediately ordered the next two as soon as I finished the first. Incredible story, and I was sincerely sad when I finished the set. Looking forward to the movie in 2012!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I love Loreanne McKenit. Her music is beautiful. When you listen her music, you feel you are in some other place with full of joy and peace. She is one of the most talented musician in our era.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I started into playing a game right away.  I only had trouble finding how to end a game, but figured it out soon enough.  It has much quicker reaction than my Pc game.
B001OQCV6K|1.0|It is clear to me that the creator of this movie did not read the same Doyle that I have read, or he would not have produced such utter drivel.  First, Sherlock Holmes is an intellectual giant, not a ninja.  I'll leave it at that for the moment, but the casting of Robert Downy Jr. as Sherlock Holmes ranks right up there with casting John Travolta in Battlefield Earth.  There was just no way it was going to work.  Now let me provide full disclosure, I am a Jeremy Brett fan.  He really became the role of Sherlock Holmes, at least as well as anyone has in film, and yes, he had some quirks, but almost all of the quirks of Jeremy Brett were in Doyle's text.  The same can not  be said for the Robert Downy Jr. version of Holmes, who is so utterly unlikable that you almost ask yourself if they were perhaps trying to make a different story altogether.  If that was the case, they should have not called it Sherlock Holmes.  This movie also fails in montage.  Subscribing to the strobe-light theory of action sequences, this seizure-inducing film should be viewed best with pain killers.  I'm trying to find a redeeming quality to the film, but alas, the only thing I think it has going for it is the top hat in the poster promoting the movie.
B000059H98|5.0|I have bought and lost this film so many times (loaners that were kept, party guests who thought my movies were gifts...) that I finally decided this one is just for me.<br /><br />My service was great and I highly recommend this seller!
B005FPT51K|5.0|I picked this up on a whim while at the local mall for our new baby two weeks ago.  I had it up and running inside of 6 minutes, I downloaded the iPhone App, quickly connected to my WiFi network, (you will need to hard wire using the included cable for the initial setup). I then gave it a name, set up a password to connect and view the video feed and was ready to go. The camera does EXACTLY what they claim it does.  The pan function works great and audio has a slight delay but is expected over WiFi.  My wife can now keep an eye on the baby wherever she happens to be in the house. Works on our iPhones and iPads with no problems.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I really like the layout and compatibility this office app offers over its competition.  Amazon has over the last few months offered each office package a chance in the free app of the day spotlight and I downloaded and tried them all. OfficeSuite Pro 5 is the only one that is currently still installed.  Now if Amazon or the developers could just get on the ball and update the apps on the Amazon App Store at anywhere close to the pace of the Google Market things would really be going great.  This app has Dropbox integration now but not on the Amazon App Store, at least as of today.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I was pretty happy with my 405CX for about the first year.  Sure, the bezel was occasionally annoying to deal with and it took Garmin a while to bullet proof their ANT driver on OSX.  But the HRM/GPS functions generally always seemed to work pretty well and the wireless upload was fairly reliable ... and after a few software updates has been very reliable.  Unfortunately, after a year or so of fairly heavy use, I've had some problems.  1. The watch band kind of rotted away where it holds the clasp - I had to order a replacement band.  2. The battery doesn't last more than a 3-4 hours at best and I need to run it through a deep discharge & full charge cycle every couple of weeks, or it doesn't work at all.  (The watch believes it doesn't have any charge, even though it might be able to run for a couple of hours.)  So, if you're looking for a GPS/HRM for 1-2 hour workouts a couple of times a week and you like the easy upload to your computer or the Garmin web site, then the 405CX is probably a good solution for you.  On the other hand, if you tend to work out 3-5 times a week and regularly want to track 4-6 hour workouts, then you're probably going to be displeased with the watch sooner than you'd like.
B005V20JKI|3.0|The game is fun but can get really laggy sometimes on my Galaxy S. If I play for an extended period of time (more than 15 min) my whole phone freezes, and I have to do a battery pull. It's a fun game other than that. If the issues could be fixed it would get 5 stars from me.
B0051T46XM|5.0|I love fantasy movies that blend our real world and the world of fantasy together into something intelligent and believable. This movie does more. It is funny, mythological, entertaining and simply fun to watch for the whole family. I truly hope the directors make a sequel, although I don't know if they could re-create the magic of this movie. The Trollhunter character was simply my favorite character of all times. He is like an older and hardened Han solo or Indiana Jones with his weary outlook on life. The jokes in the movie are very subtle... well the entire movie is a subtle joke, but that does not detract from the quality.

B004TI5N38|2.0|Zero Day is most certainly not D Baldacci's finest work.  The story is long-winded and builds to an uninspired conclusion. The hero is likeable, but the supporting cast is fittingly as exciting as a lump of coal.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love the game! This is the kind of \\"no pressure\\" puzzler that I really like to play. I do agree with the other posters that there is some sort of pixelization or drag on the screen, but it does not affect the gameplay. If not for the pixelization, I would give this 5 stars. One of my favorite Kindle Fire apps!

Now, though I am sure the book only scratches the surface, I have a better understanding of who he was and what was admirable about him. RIP Steve.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|Edit: App store has been fixed!!!  While the game was ok, it wasn't for me, and now I can delete apps from the app store, so no need to worry about anything.  I would review this application much higher if Amazon would let me remove it from the app store.  Help me out amazon, if I don't like an application because of how it is setup, then let me remove it so that I don't have to look at it anymore!  Since I can't give Amazon the one star, Atari gets stuck with it since I don't want their app.
B000UJCALI|5.0|The Shining is a film that truely scares most people, but more notably has received much critical praise over the years since its release. In 1980, the film wasn't a commercial success and was also very difficult to produce ( fire on the set, Kubrick's high number of takes, Shelly Duvall's illness). However, the film is now considered a true classic horror film. It is a must-see film in all aspects: the story (based loosely on Stephen King's book), the photography (with use of the stedi-cam), the acting and finally the music.(The music is extremely haunting)<br /><br />The special features found on the second disc are excellent, as they provide not only a \\"making of\\" documentary made by Kubrick's daughter, but also other interviews and insights about the making of the film. This 2-disc DVD is incredible and I wish I still had my copy of it. (It was stolen by MICHAELmATICIAN in 2008 during a 5K run).<br /><br />^^^For those who've seen the film:<br />Q: The second time Jack goes to the Gold Ballroom, what drink does he order at the bar which he called \\"The Hair of the Dog that bit me\\"?<br /><br />(you can answer in the comments)<br /><br />2.342
B001JRB16U|5.0|How wonderful to be able to share with my daughter one of my favorite movies.  The disc set came packaged new and shipping was so fast.  I believe I have enjoyed it even more now because I can share a clean and positive movie with her.  And she absolutely loves watching the singing and dancing.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I just moved to a new town about a month ago and didn't know anybody, so I gave this app a try because it was free. It's incredibly easy to use, and there were loads of people nearby who wanted to meet up. Some of the contacts are a bit heavy on the dating side, but you can just block anybody who gets too pushy, so it's not a problem. I started making new friends through the app so definitely think it's worth a try.
1608191664|1.0|I read about the book and extracts of it. In summary, they author seems to define free-market economists as corporatists which are not free market. There is the Chicago school which is not free market and there is the austrian school which IS free market. I found the following review online which I think could be helpful:   What Ha Joon Chang doesn't tell you about `free market economics'  Mark Pennington  28 July 2011  Professor Ha Joon Chang has become something of a hero to those who champion heterodox economic theory and who rail against the supposed intellectual hegemony of `neo-liberalism'. In a number of books such as Kicking Away the Ladder Chang sets out to overturn the alleged orthodoxies of mainstream economics by questioning the case for free trade as an appropriate development strategy in poorer countries and more widely making the case for a high regulation/big government agenda. These themes are vividly on display in Chang's latest best seller 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism. Unfortunately, also on display in this book is Chang's penchant for misrepresenting opponents, the use of straw man analyses and claims to theoretical innovation for what amounts to `re-inventing the wheel'. In several posts in the coming weeks I aim to highlight these aspects of Chang's work in the hope that his readers (should they venture onto this blog) might reconsider his `guru' status.  If there is a core characteristic to emerge from Chang's work it is a tendency to emulate the writing style of that other hero of heterodox economics - J.K Galbraith. In common with Galbraith Chang depicts himself as one of a few lonely voices standing up against the `conventional wisdom'. The particular wisdom he targets in `23 Things..' is that of `free market economics'. As with Galbraith, however, one will scour Chang's texts in vein to find serious and detailed reference to the work of authors alleged to subscribe to the positions he attacks. Thus, in a 285 page book which purports to offer a critique of `free market ideology' Chang manages a grand total of just three references to work by said ideologues and makes no attempt to distinguish schools within `free market' thought, such as the Chicago school, the public choice school or the Austrian/Hayekian tradition (surprisingly, or perhaps not, Larry Elliot the economics editor of The Guardian describes 23 Things as `superbly researched'). There is good reason for this tactic - detailed consideration of the actual views of `free market economists' - as opposed to what Chang claims they say - would make it much more difficult to construct the caricatures that Chang wants to attack. In book selling terms, better to play to the left wing gallery and construct an ideological edifice - crying out for demolition by a Chang (or a Galbraith). In this post I will focus on just two examples of this tendency. Subsequent posts will discuss further illustrations.  Read the article on the Pileus website.  Mark Pennington is the author of Robust Political Economy: Classical Liberalism and the Future of Public Policy
0374532990|5.0|I love the story of The High Line - its Death Alley origins, the decades of decay where it stood there as a sole Manhattan reminder of the once-modern ways to deal with traffic congestion, the fight of its preservation, the wondrous metamorphosis into a beautiful park, and the string of grassroots miracles that made the dream real.  This book chronicles the history of The High Line and it does so with the level of care equal to the park itself. With its first-person account followed by spreads and spreads of beautiful photographs (disclaimer: I took one of them) it's a feast for the eyes, the mind and the heart alike. I found it inspiring, humbling, and just the right mixture of down-to-Earth and pie-in-the-sky.   Especially if you're interested in urban design, or design in general, you owe it to yourself to read this. But even if not, I bet you'll find more here than you'd think.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Ok, let me start off by saying that I was 7 years old when the first season of Six Milllion Dollar Man aired on tv. I have watched every episode at least 10 times. After many many years of waiting for this tv series to be released on dvd, the day has finally came!   I was probably one of the few dedicated Six Mil fans that didnt buy the time life set. I wanted too, but just never did. Anyways, now that the set is being released in stores per season, I can afford $30 every 3 months or so..  I did notice that the dvd set from Universal is exact to the Time Life release with one exception. Its missing the booklet you get with the time life release.  Universal did this in order to fit the season into one regular sized dvd case. They did use the episode lists there where in the booket on the inside jacket underneath the dvds.  Here is a breakdown of whats on the dvds..  Season 1--6 discs (all 13 episodes plus bonus features)  --Real Bionics featurette  --An Iconic Opening featurette  --Season 1 VIPS: A Celebration of \\"The Six Million Dollar Man\\" Guest Stars  --Interactive Bonus Feature: Bionic Breakdown (clips that illustrate facets of the bionics)  --OSI Mission Debriefing: Executive Producer Harve Bennett  Of course the video and sound quality is fantasic for a 35+ year old show..Its like watching a new show again.
B004JMSIRC|1.0|I went on a Blu-ray buying spree on black Friday and when I received this item I was very disappointed. It advertises a blu-ray in the package as if it was from a store when in reality what you receive is a COPY in a plastic cd case.... Very lame and misleading to buyers, will not buy again.

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I purchased the Ultimate Matrix Collection on Blu-ray a year ago here on Amazon. I already owned the nice DVD set that came in the large black embossed Warner Brothers box however, since the Matrix is one of my favorite movies it was time to move into 1080p land.<br /><br />I anxiously popped in the Blu-ray when it arrived expecting to see a revelation of sorts and had mixed feelings. At the time I had a Panasonic TH42PZ85 1080p Plasma. I definitely saw an improvement over my PS3's upscaled presentations of the regular DVD versions. I just didn't see a super difference which, rightly or wrongly, is what I expected.<br /><br />Fast forward to this past weekend. Last week I purchased a Samsung UN46D8000 LED and set it up over the course of a few days with a new receiver. I could not believe my eyes when I popped in The Empire Strikes Back Blu-Ray. I meant to just view it for a few minutes for testing purposes but, ended up watching the whole thing. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught sight of the familiar green symbols over black of the Matrix set peering back at me and said to myself, if the Episode V looks this good, what about the Matrix?<br /><br />The revelation I was expecting when this set arrived at my home a year ago happened at last. This blu-ray set truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I just needed a better display unit in order to be able to actually see it. If you were like me and thought this set was only a modest improvement in picture quality over your dvd set, it is time to upgrade your TV! Seriously, my wife and I were glued to the screen and my wife and I were remarking on all different aspects of the movies from the fight sequences to joking about being able to see every flaw on the actor's faces. We truly were blown away and I can't wait for the next Matrix marathon to occur. This blu-ray set is definitely reference quality matierial.<br /><br />Of course the sound this set puts out is just as jaw dropping as the visual aspects. Dolby True HD never failed to impress. The Animatrix is the only disc of the 4 blu-rays where the transfer to blu doesn't increase the visual quality exponentially (well, except for Final Flight of the Osirus) as it does Matrix, Reloaded & Revolutions. But, that is because of the drawing styles of the various anime and not because of a limitation of the blu-ray itself.<br /><br />The only con to this set is that the special features are in standard def.

098357670X|5.0|I can safely say I own every book written about caricaturing from 1950 onward - call it a depraved hobby.<br />I can also say with equivalent safety that this is the best of them - bar none.

B004EPYZTE|5.0|Arnold WHO??? Long ago there might've been a Conan movie that had our pruny governor in it, but times have changed. This Conan is brutal and erotic the way the stories portrayed. He's rough, sexy and ready to beat your face to a pulp. Lots of nudity, excellent production design, great makeup/costumes, and fantastic, unobtrusive special effects propel this movie to a current classic. Superb swordplay and authentic battles, even some real horseback archery. This new Conan kicks serious ass. Robert would be proud.
B005KMX866|5.0|If you have an appreciation for the wonderful music that came from Memphis in the beginning days of Rock and Roll you will love this double CD. Chris and the boys do the songs justice without just mimicking the original artists. The original songs are wonderful and really blend well with the classics. What a great artist and a great band. I have seen them in concert three times and they never disappoint and neither does this new CD.
0385335997|2.0|This book was a struggle for me. About page 600 I hit a wall and had to take 2 breaks to read other things before I could finish it. This is the 3rd book in the Outlander series, and deals with Jamie and Claire being reunited after 20 years apart in separate places in time. Claire figures out Jamie survived the Stuart uprising with the help of her daughter and a Scottish historian, and then endeavors to go back through the stones to find him again.<br /><br />That was the interesting part. It tanked from there in my opinion. The rest of the book is a series of action adventure, usually ending with Jamie or Claire or both being hurt and one having to rescue the other, a lot of \\"you're so important to me, what would I do if I lost you again\\" type of stuff, and the like. My eyes were rolling back into my head for most of it. I think Gabaldon crossed the bridge to cheesy romance novel in this third installment, and I have no wish to go farther. Every book is a disappointment compared to the first in the series, and with that Diana, I bid you adieu.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|It's another matching game but not the same that you normally see with the likes of Bejewelled. That wouldn't annoy me, but the graphics are the pits on my EVO 3D and my Galaxy Tab. Both. I wouldn't recommend, especially for three bucks!
0756405890|4.0|What a great start to a series-I was hooked from start to finish. The story centers around Kvothe-a young boy with a genius for learning magic as well being an accomplished musician when his parents are mysteriously murdered by what until then Kvothe only thought were legends, the sinister Chandrian. After several years fighting to survive with no friends or money, he makes his way to the University to expand his knowledge of the magical arts and hopefully learn more about the Chandrian and why they would want to kill a troupe of musicians and actors. But the road is never easy, and Kvothe must keep his wits about him at all times to be able to stay alive as well as find the knowledge he seeks.<br /><br />This was a very good book-the writing style is engaging and every time I sat down to read I was instantly drawn in to the story. There were a couple parts that lagged a bit but I still enjoyed it overall. I will look forward to reading the next installment.

B005SJIP2S|5.0|I expected this to be good and it is, containing some definitive live versions of classic YES material.  The band has rarely sounded any better than they do on this new recording from Frontiers Records (a label that seems to really know how to put together an excellent package).  Of course, White, Howe and Squire have been playing this repertoire for years and are masterful musicians, Oliver grew up with it and has inherited his father's talent and Benoit David sang it for years in his cover band so these guys SHOULD have it down perfect and they do.    The recording comes in an elaborate four panel gatefold case with some truly striking Roger Dean artwork that melds together ideas from KEYS TO ASCENSION, YESSONGS and YESHOWS quite effectively.  It looks beautiful.  His artwork is EVERYWHERE - on the discs themselves, underneath the discs, everything that isn't a photo of the band is covered with Dean!  The set includes two discs of live material recorded December 1, 2009 in Lyon, an hour long concert documentary DVD and a color booklet. Very nice.  The live recordings are steller.  The sound quality is perhaps the best of any live YES material released.  It has a big, thick natural sound.  Audience noise is at a minimum.  The mix is excellent and perhaps slightly heavy on the bass (but not muddy as in YESHOWS).  The recordings do not seem to have been cleaned up too much or over processed for this release.  There are a couple of instances of less than perfect vocals (not from Benoit but on harmony parts from Chris - he goes just a wee bit flat) and these have happily been left alone instead of tampered with in a studio.  There is also an instance on \\"Starship Trooper\\" where both Benoit and Chris run out of breath and it is not corrected.  I prefer it that way.  The song list contains a lot of the standard stuff (yet another recording of ROUNDABOUT and OWNER) but the gems here are the stuff from DRAMA.  TEMPUS FUGIT and MACHINE MESSIAH at long last get their much deserved (remarkable) live recordings.  These recordings are so superior to the only other officially released material from the DRAMA album (on THE WORD IS LIVE) that the bootleg quality previous release now seems irrelevent.  We are also treated to the definitive live recording of ONWARD.  This one is stunningly beautiful.  Benoit's voice is better suited to this song than Jon's and the harmony between Chris and Benoit just soars.  ASTRAL TRAVELLER gets dusted off and is highlighted by a frantic drum solo from Alan.  Steve Howe gets a solo spot with a virtuoso flamenco inspired performance of CORKSCREW.  Oliver Wakemen does some amazing keyboard work all over this album but he is really showcased on SOUTH SIDE OF THE SKY.  Everybody in the band gets a chance to shine on this release.    The DVD is a combo interview/documentary/concert footage type thing.  It runs about an hour and unlike the DVD included in the FLY FROM HERE release, this one is more than an afterthought.  It is presented in widescreen (but stereo sound only - no 5.1 mix) and those of us who own all the previous YES videos will have heard most of the stories told by the veterans but Oliver and Benoit get equal time in this film and it is fascinating to hear Oliver talk about and then demonstrate the various styles of the different YES keyboard players. Cuddle Possum Benoit is fun to listen to and seems so genuinely likeable (I got the feeling that this guy knows EXACTLY how lucky he is to be in this legendary band).  The highlight of the DVD is the complete live performance of MACHINE MESSIAH.  To see and hear this piece executed with such precision and authority is entirely amazing.  This is one of the best performances of any YES song available on video and this one song alone makes this a must have (at least for me).  To sum up, this is a superior YES release and one that long time fans will want to grab immediately, especially if you are (like myself) of the Yeshole variety and enjoy every line-up of the band.  This current one has had a remarkable year with the release of FLY FROM HERE, a world tour and now this flashback to 2009 release of live stuff. BUY IT!

B000LTAY1U|4.0|I love this watch! It looks and works great. My only complaint is that it's a little smaller than your average mens watch. But to be fair most modern watches are ridiculously huge. Just make sure to give it a good shake if you don't intend to wear it for a while. It's a pain to reset it all the time.
B005MW8CLK|5.0|This review is for the boxed set...  I am a Huge Pumpkins fan so when this came out, I immediately preordered.  Love that it was cheaper than the pumpkins website on amazon, plus $.99 in free mp3s, and free shipping, love me some prime.  Ok, so the boxes are sturdy cardboard boxes.  Inside are some cool pics of the pumpkins from that time.  There is a great color booklet in which Billy talks about each song and song lyrics.  So happy to have this included in the set.  There are 3 disc which you can see.  Great remastering of Gish, and love getting demos and previously unreleased stuff.  Disc 3 of the show is so cool, quality of the show is good.  Ok, so for those who say ... what $24 bucks Billy is just making himself rich, do the Math.  2 Discs of songs, including remastered original gish songs, and a show DVD.  This is a great deal.    Great collection for a pumpkins fan.  So much better than the music that is out today.  These discs take me back to my high school days!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is one of King's best novels in years.  I was worried at the length of the book, thinking the story might get bogged down in places.  I was pleasantly surprised that it kept me fully engrossed throughout.  In fact, the last half of the book which focuses on the Kennedy/Oswald storyline was a page-turner for me.  I finished the last 400 pages in a day.  The characters are well developed.  The time travel aspect (always a fun topic for me) was well presented.  Although there is some violence throughout, it is fairly tame in that regard when compared to some of King's other more \\"horrific\\" works.  In other words, don't avoid this because you don't like the horror genre.  This one is different and offers something for almost everyone.
B005MW8CUG|5.0|I am a huge Pumpkins fan so when this came out I was super stoked.  Loved that Amazon had it cheaper than the pumpkins site and comes with the download code for a free track that the site was touting.  Got it yesterday, a day before other sites were shipping.  Thanks Prime!  Listened to the first cd.  Could here some differences, but was listening on my computer speakers, so will have to put it in on a better system.  The main reason I bought it was for the bonus tracks and the DVD.  Awesome DVD.  All the hits.  Billy looks like he is having a great time.  Great to see the whole band together.  Going to open and listen to Gish today.    This is a must for any pumpkins fans.  I know you are saying.... Billy is just making more money.  Listen, $24 for the remastered, demos and a DVD is a good deal no matter how you slice it.  If you already have Siamese dream, you are probably just paying for it this time instead of downloading it to have a digital copy, of stop playing the original tape you bought of it that wore out because you listened to it so many times.  Siamese Dream is a classic, and this is a great opportunity to get your hands on it in a better format with santa's sleigh loaded down so much even rudolph can't pull it with smashing pumpkins goodies.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have used Splashtop on both an Android & Apple Smartphone, and I purchased the App for the Kindle Fire. After you set it up and enter a Gmail address, it interacts extremely well with the Desktop Computer. The Fire has an excellent Browser, and the Screen is sharper than the iPad 2. I don't know why Reviewers haven't been mentioning it, Anyway, Splashtop is very easy to use, with a window which shows up after you connect to your Desktop reminding you how to use finger taps to control the Curser on the Screen. Literally your computer is fully available anywhere in the world where wifi is available. Reviews stated that Splashtop was better with Video than other products, and I have found that to be true. I have watched NFL Game Rewind video which streams and looks excellent on Android. It was a little choppy on the iPhone 4, however. In summary, I have had a great experience with Splashtop, and I feel it is the App to go with if you need a Remote Desktop Connection
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This game is so addicting. If only there were more areas to play through! I enjoyed it, even going back to try to 'perfect' all the levels again.
B002BWP49C|5.0|This was absolutely the best movie of the series so far. It stayed  pretty true to the book, and it pulled off some of the harder scenes,  i.e. The wolves communicating and the birth scene even though it was tamed  way down from the book which I understand due to the PG13 rating. Can not  wait for the last one.
0553801473|2.0|This book is quite boring and provides little to no suspense. I would strongly recommend that readers avoid this novel.<br /><br />I skipped the fourth book in the series, \\"A Feast For Crows\\", because of horrific \\"word-of-mouth\\" feedback, and should not have invested time reading this novel either.<br /><br />The first book in this series was excellent, and the second one was quite good, but each successive novel is more tedious than the prior one. Needless to say, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is the most boring novel of the series thus far.<br /><br />The author continually drones on and on about inane, nonconsequential matters. He spends inordinate amounts of time describing scenery in the most minute detail, and also subjects the readers to numerous narratives that possess zero entertainment value. For example, readers should not read a single Daenerys narrative (they are the equivalent of \\"watching paint dry\\").<br /><br />At this point, Mr. Martin is solely writing for the sake of writing. My view is that he plans to extend the serious indefinitely in order to reap as large a monetary windfall as possible.  There is a colossal difference in \\"entertainment value\\" between this book and the first book in the series.<br /><br />I gave this book 2-stars, rather than 1-star, because it is the perfect book to read prior to retiring for the evening. I normally finish a novel every week or two, but spent 3-months reading this novel. The book will undoubtedly put any reader to sleep within 5-20 minutes.  This book is perfect for someone who is hoping to fall asleep quickly.
B000002KHH|4.0|It was a huge influence on all music around today, mainly rock and metal. Their first album was more blues and hard rock, Paranoid is similar but a little heavier which would be classified as metal. Their self-titled debut was the first metal album in existence but Paranoid was more successful and it changed metal. Music would be a lot different if they continued with the same sound on their debut and never evolved. Master of Reality is even a bigger change than Paranoid, it's darker and heavier than their first 2. Personally, I don't think Paranoid's their crowning achievement and I prefer their debut and Master of Reality because they sound more unique from each other but Paranoid makes a connection between both of them. They have several great albums but you can't go wrong with their first 6. Hand of Doom stands out the most and it's one of my top 5 favorite Black Sabbath songs of all time. It also includes 2 of their most popular hits Paranoid and Iron Man which most people are familiar with.
B0055SWM08|1.0|This game simply does not work for Kindle.  The problems started with flickering graphics.  Then slow speeds. Finally it froze and completely crashed the device,  which I was unable to reboot for some time.  Use at your peril.
0142000655|5.0|So why should anyone bother posting, or on the other end reading, a review of a novel that has already been established as a classic and also already been reviewed to oblivion.  My late arrival to the reading game is no real excuse.  Neither is my reluctance to read Steinbeck for so long due to the submission I have allowed on my part to the passing opinions of holiday readers that Steinbeck is simply a dry read.  When I turned twenty four, I went on a reading tear of four hundred and fifty books in five years in what I see now as a subconscious attempt to recover an early stage of Proustian academic and social development after not having cracked open one book prior to that time.  During that stretch, I had never had the desire to read anything written by Steinbeck.  This changed toward the end of the last school year when I saw a copy of East of Eden by John Steinbeck on a student's desk.  As a high school English teacher, I find elation in inspiring students to read books beyond what is assigned in the classroom.  Last year, I found a new book on the desk of one of my students every week.  When I asked for what reason she is reading all these books, she responded by saying that she wanted to break my record.  I grabbed the copy of East of Eden from her desk and asked if the reading wasn't too dry and slow.  Her reply was simply that \\"The writing is so beautiful.\\"  To see a high school student in a regular English class read on his or her own is a welcomed surprise; to hear the student say that such writing is beautiful warrants investigation.      Once breaking open the cover of the novel, I discovered that all of my previous prejudices about the author's writing content and style were grossly misappropriated.  I had committed the worst sin anyone hoping to become a scholar could commit through judgment based on the opinions of others without ever having read or understood a single word in the novel.  The best way I could describe my experience with the novel is this.  While reading East of Eden, my friend would tell me \\"the best part is coming up.\\"  For me, the best part was the very first page of the novel.  Then, the best part was page two so on and so forth until I finished the novel.      The only flaw I could see in the novel is that the description of how Lee is presented seemed pointless and a little racist.  Otherwise, the novel was an absolutely perfect one in my mind.  Steinbeck is able to burrow into the soul of the major characters in the novel of which there are many.  I found myself rooting for characters only to swiftly turning against them and vice-versa.  Small characters become big and people who I thought were going to have a big impact never undergo any real change.  To say that a book is engrossing is a fine compliment, but to have the heart broken and the spirit inspired multiple times throughout the novel is rare.  After having read this book, I felt like I had lived.  The characters became the types of friends one considers part of one's extended family.      If you ask a common acquaintance in scholarship or academic environment, very few would raise an eyebrow over the enthusiasm over this novel.  East of Eden's absence is in the desired book lists of the every-reader.  The most common opinion I hear about the books that people read are what is new and what is different.  For this reason and perhaps also the apprehension of being bored to death by something that is out of date, these classics are avoided.  I like the new and the different as much as the next person, but I also like what is good.  Steinbeck not only brings life to his characters by being able to draw the reader into participating in the events and decisions of the characters' lives, but he is also a master craftsman of language.  If the reader cannot find himself or herself lost in the lives, thoughts, and actions of the characters, he can find a paradise in the beauty of the descriptive language, the precise word choice, and thefine weaving of the well crafted sentence.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This was a fantastic movie that seemed to only get better in the days after I watched it.  It kind of slowly sunk in.  A large part of what makes this a beautiful picture is the slack key masters featured throughout.  I was not familiar with the musicians, but am thankful this movie helped me discover them.  Bravo for a wonderful soundtrack and for showcasing this music so unique to Hawaii.
B005IZLPKQ|1.0|I have to admit a lot of mixed feelings on this movie.  Samuel Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, and a few others I recognized in this film notwithstanding, somehow this movie cheapens the above and beyond super heroism of everyday men and women in the armed forces serving in hostile zones of combat.  Maybe it was different in WWI or WWII, but beginning with the Korean war, this country has had trouble welcoming their heroes returning from war - especially from Vietnam and since that time.  These days there are no ticker tape parades and cheering crowds who respect and honor the men and women who have watched their fellow soldiers die on the battle field.  There is widespread unemployment, a nation near bankruptcy, and a misery index as high or higher than when Jimmy Carter was president.  And this film won't make you feel good about being given a 4F rating by the Selective Service System registration office, if you honestly wanted to serve in the military.  So it is hard for me to rally behind a film that suggests our nation's finest require a super-chemistry enhanced hero to inspire them to enthusiastically face the enemy.  Especially if the country you're fighting in hates you being there.  But never mind all that, it's just a movie.  A movie about how drugs can make women fall in love with you, taking drugs and experimenting with drugs can make men who hate you willing to follow you as their leader and fight by your side for whatever mission you personally undertake, and taking drugs and experimenting with drugs will let you live over a hundred years and never physically age a single day.  The message in this film is that a sublevel romance that never finds fruition is enough to give somebody the inspiration to accomplish anything even far above and beyond human ability - no wait, that was the drugs, nevermind.  This movie has very little gore, predominantly has a lot of gun violence (more of what today's America desperately needs), a little bit of language but very tame by today's standard, and no female nudity.  It's a PG-13 film, and for having a 140 million dollar budget, you'd think the writers and producers would require a little bit more out of the director and editor.  Dud, flop, fail, fizzle, flummox, lay an egg, loser, turkey, and weenie.  Not even a good chic flick.  I wouldn't give this away to somebody I hated.  Bonfire fodder.bit of language but very tame by today's standard, and no female nudity.

B005J7K950|3.0|This is an interesting curiousity. Its a MTV 1980's remix of Metropolis with Pat Benatar, Loverboy and Fredie Mercury complete with tinted pictures and subtitles. It would make for good wall display at a retro club, but as a film or a version of Metropolis by Fritz Lang.....I dont know.<br /><br />The music is a distraction, the subtitles change the pacing of the film and the tints are sometimes annoying. But it can be an interesting experience to see. I would almost classify this as a seperate unique work from Fritz Lang's film.<br /><br />When the film came out, I hated it because I thought it was a butchery of Lang's work and because there was a danger then that this day-glow metropolis would be preserved for the future rather than the original. But the world has changed, we have a better version of Lang's film on Blu-Ray available now than I could have ever expected then and the MTV video world era that spawned this film is itself long gone. Ironically a film that set out to preserve Metropolis because of its importance now itself needs to be preserved as a representation of days gone by.<br /><br />I dont hate it anymore. Its now its own strange window into another era.
0451228375|1.0|I read \\"World Without End\\" because members of my book club chose this for our meeting - after their good experience from reading \\"The Pillars of the World\\".  I can't believe I finished reading 1000 pages. I admit there are suspense, drama, touching moments. However, after 200 pages, I was bored. I knew the author was clever, contriving and his whole purpose was to write a Hollywood movie - the longer it is, the more tickets it can sell, the more income he can get.   Many developments in this story are completely incredible, e.g, Caris fortune changes within two hours; she followed the English army to France to look for Earl Roland. I wonder if the author chose a time in the past because he can lie and we would not be able to verify. Also, the plague is a convenient way to surprise the readers. But I guessed Ralph's fate the moment I read about Gwenda's illegitimate son.    World Without End is not much different from a TV series like Desperate Housewives. Both bring in lots of characters, and concoct suspenseful stories about each character. They are simply commercial products. I don't dislike this book because of its length - I read Wally Lamb's I Know This Much Is True three times and I still can't put it down once I start reading it. By comparison, World Without End is bland and boring. It provides mild enjoyment like that from chewing a huge plain beagle, while I prefer something tasty and elegant like dim sum.
0374275637|2.0|Kahneman has been working since the 1970s to dismantle the idea that human economic behavior consists of rational decision making. He was given a nobel prize in 2002 for his work. This book is a continuation of that grand project. At the heart of the project is of course the contradiction of attempting to create a rational description of what the work ultimately wants to prove is irrational behavior. And within the contradiction is the deeper (unanswered) question of just what rational decision making is.   The book will be popular for many reasons. The worshippers of pure science will eat it up. The political right will see the book's conclusion as scientifically invalidating any attempts at social policy by the government. (people can't be helped because they are not rational) The political left will see the book's conclusion as scientifically invalidating the idea of free market economics in favor of the nanny state. (people can't make their own decisions and need the government to decide for them). The success of Kahneman as a writer is that he has created something that can appeal to a whole lot of people.  What drags down the book is its arrogance and tendency to operate at the boundary between philosophy and observational science. The author also has always had a habit of staying away from the bigger questions just below the surface of his work: The nature and definition of rationality itself. Are statistics and basic logic themselves rational? Can irrational behavior ever really be expressed or described by the arch rational model?  This is at its worst when the author comes back to now famous Linda problem. He admits the controversy around the problem but fails to really address it properly in the book. The Linda problem (in one form) gives a minimum amount of background about a person and then asks which is the more probable of two conclusions. The \\"correct\\" answer is based on what is called \\"reason\\" but which is in fact a strict interpretation of the question based on statistics and narrow, formal logic. A correct rational answer to the question might be that the information provided is insufficient to make any deduction and that forcing a choice between two alternatives is a false choice. But the author's view is that reason requires the mathematical answer that the probabilty of two conditions being true is always less than the probability of one condition being true. His answer is correct....but it is the only rational answer? Absolutely not. His right answer is the product of defining reason as the sole product of statistics and AND/OR/NOT style logic. Further, its the product of reading a question with a particular mindset in a particular way. The experiment is useful in capturing a type of decision people make. But using it to make a qualtitative judgement about that decision (irrational) is not useful. Its a prime example of how the author overreaches in various ways.  The author in the book comes up with an abstract structural model of human behavior. He divides reasoning into \\"system 1\\" (fast) and \\"system 2\\" (slow). Its very cute and very useful in this arguments. But I didn't find it very convincing. It doesn't seem to be speed that the issue. Its the approach and the context of the problem. Most people just don't treat life as an endless series of statistics and AND/OR/NOT logic problems on an SAT test. They don't treat decisions that way for good reasons. In particular, IMO, because rational decision making isn't equal to probabilistic statistical decision making or AND/OR/NOT logic. What the author seems IMO to be running into is the problems of his limited math-based model to represent human decision making rather than human decision making necessarly being irrational.  I found the observations in the book about human behavior interesting (the raw data). But not the author's interpretations, models or conclusions about the behavior. The models overreach too much in their conclusions and are too simplisitic (the curse of the so-called social sciences). To me, understanding that people will usually react a particular way in a given situation (observation) is far more interesting than coming up with a half-baked theory explaining \\"why\\".

B003Y5H542|5.0|I loved this movie!!!! At first I was very skeptical about the movie mainly because Johnny Depp as a western lizard kinda disturbed me haha But after I watched it I realized that Johnny Depp can pull off anything, and this movie proves it! :D The concept of the story is quite interesting, and its quite funny :D If you are still skeptical all I can tell you is that you have to just watch it! Take it from a person whos seen almost every Johnny Depp film, its worth your time :)   I would have given a complete storyline but Im afraid I might give to much away haha so you'll just have to watch it to find out.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|Daft Punk, the French duo of Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, has been known for its electrifying dance music.  In a small bedroom with only a couple of synthesizers and a drum machine, Daft Punk has created hits such as \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" and \\"Around the World\\".  In 2010, the duo forayed into the world of film with the debut of TRON: Legacy.  This film score was groundbreaking in many ways, so much so that it has created a whole new genre of music, namely movie music that can stand on its own.  Daft Punk achieved this feat by creating new types of music than they had originally made, creating a new type of film score than originally accompanied presentations on the big screen, and creating a new way to mesh together multiple genres of music.       One of the ways Daft Punk is pioneering a whole new genre of music is by being innovative with the type of music they create.  Though Bangalter made the score to the 2002 French film Irreversible and though the duo has made the film Electroma together, the TRON: Legacy soundtrack is definitely not like anything Daft Punk has created before.  Though this may disappoint dedicated Daft Punk fans, the product they have created is quite compelling.  Instead of catchy dance floor hits, Bangalter and Homem-Christo worked with a 90-piece orchestra to create a beautifully dark and melancholy film score.  When interviewed by Dazed and Confused Magazine in December 2010, Bangalter commented, \\"This project is by far the most challenging and complex thing we have ever been involved with.  Coming from our background of making electronic music in a small bedroom, and ending up having our music performed by a 90-piece orchestra... recording this orchestra was a very intense experience\\".  The soundtrack is very orchestra-heavy, a very large step away from Daft Punk's music of the past.  Though the album does contain some dance tunes more similar to Daft Punk's usual fare like \\"End of Line\\" and \\"Derezzed\\", there is quite a mix of classical and electric music.  Unlike many of their previous projects, there are no vocals (minus one track with Jeff Bridges speaking about the plotline of the movie) over the music.  Also, many of Daft Punk's earlier pieces were rather upbeat and quick-paced.  TRON's soundtrack provides a stark contrast.  The score has many driving rhythms and melodies, but it has a very dark and ominous sound (as can be heard in sounds like \\"Arena\\" and \\"The Game Has Changed\\").  Over all, Daft Punk stretched their creative music style to craft the TRON soundtrack and, in doing to, helped to create a new type of movie music.       Another reason this soundtrack is opening up a whole new genre of music is by changing the way movie music is thought about.  Needless to say, electronic music and classical music have been used in tandem before, notably in the soundtrack for the original 1982 TRON composed by Wendy Carlos (known for Switched-On Bach, a Moog-synthesized version of Bach pieces).  This soundtrack used both a Moog and digital synthesizers and featured the London Philharmonic Orchestra.  This marriage was not quite successful (Carlos ended up replacing the orchestra recording with digitally synthesized versions). Daft Punk used Wendy Carlos' original score as inspiration when they were asked to create the music for TRON: Legacy.  The director of TRON: Legacy, John Kosinski, knew that Daft Punk had the necessary skills to create the score for his movie.  He knew they were \\"more than just dance guys... There's a lot going on behind those masks\\".  Though some of the songs on the soundtrack do resemble those off a classic film score (such as \\"Overture\\" and \\"Finale\\"), the majority of the album sounds starkly different from any other soundtrack out there.  Daft Punk used synthesizers to create driving rhythms and melodies in songs like \\"Arena\\", \\"Rinzler\\", and \\"Derezzed\\".  The music is loud and powerful, not meant to sit in the background like normal film scores.  When the final mix was made at Skywalker Ranch in Northern California, the mixers said it was \\"the loudest film [they'd] ever mixed\\".  Unlike normal film scores that are usually made after the movie is complete, TRON: Legacy was made to go with the music.  Due to all of these factors, the TRON: Legacy soundtrack is a very different type of film score.       Finally, Daft Punk was innovative in creating the TRON soundtrack by more closely meshing classical and electronic music.  Bangalter has noted that \\"In the past, [Daft Punk] has worked with clashing genres like disco and heavy metal, and here [in TRON] [they] would do it with film scores... this idea of the ultimate retro-futurism\\".  This combination can be seen throughout the album.  Numerous themes in the film score are repeated in several different songs (including Wendy Carlos' original theme!), many times in both electronic and orchestral instruments.  At some points, the listener cannot even distinguish between when melodies and harmonies are being played by electronic or acoustic instruments.  By successfully meshing classical and electronic music, Daft Punk has created a very listener-friendly type of movie music.  This music is so listener-friendly that, unlike many other scores, it can be listened to and enjoyed outside the context of the movie theater.       Daft Punk's TRON soundtrack is a new and exciting piece of technosonic art.  New techniques for Daft Punk, for film music, and for the combination of classical and electronic music have helped the TRON: Legacy soundtrack to create a new genre of stand-alone movie music.  In many minds, this soundtrack is one of the greatest ever produced.  Thank goodness director Joseph Kosinski went to Daft Punk to create the soundtrack to this movie.  No doubt a traditional soundtrack would have done the job, but Daft Punk's version has reinvented what a movie score should be.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle is one of the best science fiction books I've read. The original film was also very good and it followed the story pretty closely. Another selling point was that women liked to see Charlton Heston's bare chest. To make a successful prequel movie about the events that caused the rise of the apes is even more impressive, and no humans (male of female) had to take their shirts off. Caesar (Andy Serkis) is the first simian to speak English fluently. He even speaks it better than his captors who like to taunt him. He gets bored sitting around in a cage all day, so he teaches his fellow apes to revolt in the hopes of achieving freedom, thus becoming their leader without an apparent election. Evolution is not the culprit in this film, instead it is caused by an experimental drug without any involvement from PETA, KFC, or Pamela Anderson.<br /><br />According to some sources, Serkis required some minor plastic surgery to alter his appearance for this film. The procedure was not as intensive due to his previous role in King Kong where he also played an ape, although he was much larger. The transition from Gollum to King Kong was much more problematic according to one of Michael Jackson's former plastic surgeons.<br /><br />Believe it or not, it's people like us who make the apes kill on the Golden Gate bridge. This whole mess could have been prevented if people had treated their pets better and had not put leashes around their necks. What is really amazing is that these poorly equipped apes are too organized for the human authorities to handle.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I would change the design:  revise the way the part of the cover which makes it stand hooks to the back of the cover.  It tends to slip out of the groove and fall flat with a very slight touch, and it only has one position which requires that the reader be in front of it at a certain height.  So, I would have two grooves providing two different positions, and make the tracks deeper so the flap engages better and does not slip out of the groove.  I still like this cover, and will try to adjust to the design issues above.
0307279189|5.0|Vastly entertaining.  I had many laugh out loud moments standing by myself reading this on the train.  I probably looked a little crazy! I've always found the concept of minimalist running interesting and wondered how certain tribes and cultures practice it.  Christopher McDougall is a fantastic writer.  He manages to disseminate a ton of information while keeping the book engaging from beginning to end.  Through the authors research and stories you get an idea of human potential in a more natural state.  I don't find the book to be preachy about the concepts that are explored in this book.  It just seems investigative... like the author is giving us an interesting alternative to examine.  Even if you end up hating his non-conventional premise it's worth the read.
0060558121|2.0|This book feels like a quilt where the ideas and details are exquisite, but something feels disjointed/confused in the whole end-product that makes it slightly unsatisfying. This deficiency can be masked if the reader generously fills in the blank with creative interpretations of his or her own, like one tend to do with post-modern fiction, but the author's message (is there a definitive commentary?) would feel lost after that.<br /><br />One problem might be common in executing the genre of urban fantasy, where extraordinary events are embedded in such gritty, realistic settings (such as dead woman walking and getting a job at a Florida gas station), that I wished Gaiman had included little bits of explanation along the way, instead of having a big dollop of revelation in the final chapters - if he addressed them at all. The prolonged suspension of disbelief and constant recalls to the everyday world left the questions build up and either frustrate enjoyment of the details or lead to audience apathy.<br /><br />Another issue I took with the book is the absence of the not-yet-obsolete religions, and their relation to the gods of technology. I feel the author was avoiding the obvious question and the challenge it could pose to his plot.<br /><br />However, I enjoyed Gaiman's imagination in bringing over mythological characters and planting them in 21st century America, as well as his personifications of the modern deities.
B004XQO90E|4.0|SPOILER CODE: There is no time travel.<br /><br />I ascribe to that theory for my current modern conspiracy Delta Green role-playing campaign, and so does Source Code.  The premise is simple, if considerably underused in science fiction.  Source Code seeks to correct that imbalance. Like Donnie Darko, Source Code posits that perception is reality. There's no such thing as one time stream, but rather multiple streams formed every time a decision is made.<br /><br />Source Code uses this many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics to fight the war on terror. Army helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is co-opted to investigate a terrorist attack on a train in Chicago. He jumps into the body of Sean Fentress, a school teacher, who is traveling with his attractive but platonic companion Christina Warren (adorable Michelle Monaghan).  It doesn't end well.<br /><br />Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) soon dispels Stevens' confusion: he has eight minutes to go back into the Source Code, a snapshot of reality that's basically a highly interactive video game.  Time is of the essence, so Stevens is sent back into the Source Code again and again to find the bomb and the identity of the terrorist, his reservations notwithstanding. It's about this time that Source Code starts to strain under the weight of its plot.<br /><br />Stripped to its basics, Source Code is basically a two-person play about relationships, one in person (Stevens/Warren) and the other long-distance (Stevens/Goodwin).  The camera pulls in tight on Gyllenhall and Farmiga as they engage in alternately pained, exasperated, frustrated, and flirty conversations.  It pulls out to appreciate Monaghan's loveliness and Gyllenhall's handsome profile.  This is an actor's movie.<br /><br />It's also a Duncan Jones film, who is fast becoming a modern-day Phillip K. Dick as he tackles questions of self in his films. Like Moon, Source Code is as much about the definition of reality as it advances the plot.<br /><br />Which is perhaps why the resolution isn't particularly compelling.  Source Code studiously avoids any hint of political controversy by having a bland villain with little motivation. It telegraphs its plot twists. And its ending is a little too neat for my tastes.  But then, Source Code is more interested in poking your brain than tugging your heart strings.  Jones' primary goal seems to be focused on getting the audience to view time travel differently, and in that regard Source Code is a resounding success.  I finally grokked the basics of quantum mechanics thanks to the extras on the DVD.ion isn't particularly compelling.

0143034901|4.0|Enjoyable:<br />+ Good writing, and unique setting brought to life (I haven't encountered any books set in the era of the Spanish Civil War, or for that matter in Barcelona, the fascinating old school but avant garde setting). Some scenes seem straight out of a Gothic-Dal&iacute; painting; despite that the vocabulary is quite simple and reads easily, the extravagance comes from the unique choice of details that the author chooses to describe.<br />+ Great characters and dialogue, especially the rascal Ferm&iacute;n and his witticism; and Daniel the main character (who exudes a kind of shy awkwardness of a dreamer writer boy who grows into a young man with integrity. Reminds me of Harry Potter). And one of my favorite characters is the plump good-hearted prostitute towards the end. The humorous/comic relief characters seem to be better developed than the tragic ones though.<br />+ Good concept: the fact that the story revolves around a mystery involving a writer, a hidden library, and the bookseller's son. Who says bookish people can't make exciting protagonists? The market is saturated with the old trope of a dumb farmhand who somehow discovers their destiny to do great things. Pray explain how do they suddenly gain the skillz in a matter of months or years? Bookish heroes are more apt vehicles for conveying witticisms and probing the nuances of the unfolding mystery, and make for a more interesting read.<br /><br />Mediocre:<br />- Plot - some aspects of it, can be a tad predictable for readers who have been exposed to plenty of Gothic-family-saga kind of stories.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|This was a very good episode. Unlike other viewers, I would not classify the prior 3 or 4 weeks as \\"slow.\\" This show -- like the comic books -- is not just about killing and dodging zombies. Instead, it is a complex television drama. So, if the characters are not slaughtering legions of zombies every week, I do not consider it a slow episode.  If the show were just about the zombies, it would not be rated as high as it is (I certainly would not watch it), and it would not have received such critical acclaim.<br /><br />The episode answers a lot of questions, including the location of Sophia, the missing girl. That story line drained a lot of time from the show, but it does provide for a very dramatic conclusion.<br /><br />Speaking of the conclusion, a lot of debates have taken place on Walking Dead fan pages about the appropriateness of Shane's behavior. Many fans of Shane say that his callousness and murderous zeal towards the zombies make him a stronger character. I encourage these individuals to reassess their evaluation by looking at the last moments of this episode. Although Shane claims to be a tough guy who could simply kill zombies ruthlessly, at the end of the show, he was paralyzed by painful emotions. Rick, on the other hand, was not. Throughout the series and in this episode in particular, Rick has managed to combine leadership with empathy, proving that one does not have to become blind to the suffering of others and place on layers of phony masculinity in order to survive.  Also, Shane's inability to move beyond Lori (they only had a brief affair), screams weakness.<br /><br />Aside from the brilliance of the episode, I have 2 small complaints. The first one, I have already written about. The gender roles on the show are bothersome to me. The women are subservient and \\"emotional.\\" The men are stoic and leaders. Glenn's girlfriend continues to play a Sybil role. In the previous episode she picked a fight with Glenn and then suddenly kissed him. She did it again in this episode.<br /><br />Second, I am unhappy with the lack of use of T-Dog. At this point, his character is a mere token. Ironically, in the comic book, Shane is killed very early, and \\"Tyrese\\" (a black character), plays the lead with Rick. T-Dog only spoke 9 words in the last episode (yes - I counted). I would not be surprised if they kill him off the show. That would discard a lot of potential.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms, I look forward to the seeing how the show progresses.Second, I am unhappy with the lack of use of T-Dog.

0439023513|3.0|Just okay for a third book. Fails to tie up some of the trails left in earlier books. Requires a higher degree of suspension of belief. (who on earth shoots propaganda films while on the front-line?!) Lots of unnecessary deaths despite the theme on the futility of war/regime change. Ending was alright, but can't erase the overall sense that the main character was shattered and willingly manipulated as a tool, and didn't really summon the kind of probity and defiance we had come to expect from heroes/heroines.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I recently saw Carole King on television and began to remember all of her hits.   So, I ordered Tapestry. I listened to it in college over and over again in the early 70s.  And I can still sing along with every song. And, what a great memory those times were!
0142000671|5.0|Thanks to someone who callously spoiled the ending for me, I was able to appreciate most of the symbolism and themes that led up to the ending. Typically the topic of \\"great American dream\\" don't appeal to me in literature (such as in Death of  Salesman), because it brought with it the innocence and naiveté of a much too bygone era. (Today we have Occupy Wallstreet and the class warfare of the 1% vs. the rest). But this novella captured the desire of every man not to make it in vast fortunes or greed, but for a little bit of independence, a little bit of one's own earth and sky. The message hits the spot at this time.
B005Z271Y6|3.0|She is truley amazing and just as good live as on her studio albums.  I was disappointed in the technical aspects though; DTS-HD MA 16-bit/48Khz sound, Dolby Digital Stereo 224kb/s track, 1080i 60fps video.  I would have liked to seen a 24-bit audio track and 1080p 24fps video  Really low quality as far as Blu-ray is concerned, still sounded great though.  The CD bonus is a nice addition.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This movie depicts the sacrifice and love of our Savior in such a realistic manner.  It is difficult to watch some of the scenes but it is so powerful and moving.  Watching it is an unforgetable experience.
B0047E6LW6|5.0|The music of Ghost is very difficult to convey with words. Mix 1970's metal with cheery melodies... and dark lyrics about hell, unholy rituals, and all things that go bump in the night and you got one \\"hell\\" of an album. Every song is catchy with plenty of time changes to keeep any listener from being bored, dark lyrics that are sung in such a cheerful way that you will feel like every day is Halloween when you sing along. However, if songs about Satan offend your religious sensibilities, even in a light-hearted manner, this album is not for you. For the rest of us sinners, this album is a treat to our ears. The only trick is the songs are rather short -- the album could have used longer songs, or at least another track. Aside from that one complaint, I cannot wait to hear their next album as I just cannot get enough of this band's infectious music.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Here's the down low. December 29th All the Harry Potters are going into the Warner vault (no vault is not a Disney coined term) That means for about 2-5+ years they will print no more new Harry Potter DVDs. For probably about a year or so the warehouses will continue to ship what they have to stores like, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and stores like Movie Trading Company. Gradually the dwindling of supplies will cause the bigger stores to stop ordering them and only stores like mine will carry them until the warehouse runs out and then we run out and for once the Harry Potter movies become rare. Prices will skyrocket because it's a popular series.<br /><br />Now, 5+ years later they release an awesome SUPER special addition that will cost a billion dollars and have all the bells and whistles.<br /><br />If you're looking for all the movies by themselves to tide you over until the Super special edition, this is it. It's small and compact and comes with language options (something I didn't expect). So if you're a fan, go ahead and by it and wait for the awesome. Of course they won't release the special editions right away, that's bad business....
0385720920|3.0|It's clear from the onset that CHOKE is chock-full of irreverence. What else do you expect from a book that's essentially a sex addict's \\"moral inventory\\"? The book is not for those who can't stomach the thought of a woman's ingesting enough sperm to warrant a stomach pump. Palahniuk is, I think, an acquired taste. His prose clip in sound bites that becoming addicting once you get used to his rhythm. Behind his obscenity, meanness, and posturing, I get the sense that he is, at heart, a pretty sensitive guy. CHOKE is what Palahniuk does best: dark comedy that's so tragic and ridiculous, it's becomes brutally, uncomfortably hilarious--if you're into this brand of humor, I think you'll like the ride.<br /><br />Was not impressed by the first half of the book, but the last few chapters well made up for slow build: Palahniuk destroys what he builds in such spectacular fashion, I forgave him. It's like a good joke; he lays down the hints and pays it off in dividend. Could do without all the distracting euphemisms, though. Interestingly \\"taking the dog out\\" acquires new meaning after reading CHOKE. Note: you have to accept the fiction he offers at face value.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I can't stress this, if you haven't seen/bought this movie you should be punished for not supporting amazing stories. Also if at any point you didn't buy/see this movie and instead went and bought/saw Twilight you should be punished again for ruining vampires. The american remake is good, but nothing is quite like this incredible film. Its in my humble opinion the best vampire movie in agaes. It's not scary, just good.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I purchased two of these cases for my wife and I: one in pink and one in black.  These cases hold the Kindle Fire firmly in place and add almost no bulk to the device.  The cover folds back and creates a stand when the edge is inserted into the shallow groove in the back.  The Fire must be in the case for this to function properly as it needs the added weight to insure the stand functions as intended.  There is also an elastic strap that when flipped around to front holds the case closed and securely protects the screen.  The materials seem to be durable and the slightly rubberized texture makes the case easy to grip with little worry that it would slip out of my hands.  The design allows for easy access to the port on the bottom for charging.  My wife and I have both been thoroughly pleased with our cases.  I hope this review is helpful for any potential buyers.
B000SSGUEO|4.0|Wow, this is a great remastering job on this concert. I have the Long Player  from the early 80's and though that record is great sound wise, I have to give the edge to the remastered CD version. This was a very good show with some great moments throughout. But I especially loved the 30 minute freaked out version of Space Trucking. This was a nod to their tried and tested jamming and improvisation prowess of the Mark 2 era. Insturmentally, this version easily holds its own with the Mark 2 workouts of this classic Purple number. Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore are from another planet on this song. I have played it 5 times at full volume. Thats really the only way to play hard rock like this. Turn it up untill you feel your fillings in your teeth begin to rattle. Anyways, this is a great CD and I recommend it to all Deep Purple fans and to Hard Rock lovers in general. I wish there was more material from the mark 3 line up available like this. But I am glad for what we do have. By the way check out Glenn Hughe's new band, \\"Black Country Communion\\". Really good classic hard rock. He sings better than ever these days.  Take care.  Rick from Bradford PA.
B0052TDGQO|3.0|This album will be a tad on the boring side to any adult.  The topic matters are generally &#34;too 'pure' and too 'adolescent'&#34;.  On stage, Scotty is lovely, but the album... leaves much to be desired, to be as nice and as Southern as I can be, coming from the West Coast and all as I do.  He is not nearly as creative with his voice on his album as he was with it on American Idol or as is his counterpart, Lauren Alaina, on her album.  A  friend of mine actually said Scotty's voice sounded a bit like the  mooing of a cow on his album.  Though I would not at all go so far, I got the idea and I think he (the friend) was correct.  There is the same tonal quality with little variance or creativity through the entire album, i.e., there's a slow, steady 'not much' quality to it throughout.  Nonetheless, I suspect this is due to the producers at hand, not to Scotty or his level of talent, the latter which is clearly BIG.

I can only speculate that those who find any entertainment value in a story describing the torment and torture of a baby the very reason our society is rapidly sinking into a state of depravity from which we can never recover.

B005M5OSBK|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />Greetings to the music-loving romantics of Portland, Oregon!  Pink Martini fans are scattered throughout the world of course, but those who live (or have lived) in The Rose City simply have a special place in their hearts for this sparkling gem of a musical group.<br /><br />Released digitally earlier this month and now finally available in a lovely, \\"you can actually hold it in your hands,\\" book-like, collectorish edition, this is the first Pink Martini compilation, and it represents the group's recorded career with something from each of the six studio albums as well as nine previously unreleased tracks.  This accomplishes the neat trick of simultaneously offering a collection of both familiar and new music in an effort to draw in fans from all the phases and stages of Pink Martinidom.<br /><br />The song choices are heavily slanted (more than half) toward the group's first two albums, seeming to suggest that Pink Martini does not place as high a value on their more recent work.  Or perhaps this is an intentional effort to give the fans the songs that the group thinks they might want most, along with some new stuff thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Regardless, this is all vibrant, beautiful music.  If you are just jumping on the Pink Martini bandwagon, be assured that if you are a relatively intellectual, music-and-dance-loving romantic with a taste for the international, you will surely find something to love here.  Also, be aware that due to song choice and arrangement, this compilation album will likely whet rather than satisfy your appetite for this group and you'll find yourself handing over even more money to get some of their studio recordings as well - which is the mark of a great album, compilation or not.<br /><br />I hope you will find the following statistics helpful:<br /><br />Number of songs from SYMPATHIQUE = 5<br /><br />Number of songs from HANG ON LITTLE TOMATO = 7 (including two different versions of Una Notte a Napoli)<br /><br />Number of songs from HEY EUGENE! = 1<br /><br />Number of songs from SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS = 2<br /><br />Number of songs from JOY TO THE WORLD = 1<br /><br />Number of songs from 1969 = 1<br /><br />Total number of previously unreleased tracks = 9 (Pink Martini's website claims the number is eight, but I think they forgot to count \\"Ma Solitude\\" with Georges Moustaki)<br /><br />Number of previously unreleased tracks that do not appear in any form on a studio album = 4<br /><br />Be aware that the Amazon.com track listing for the CD version of this album is incorrect on multiple counts (though the MP3 track listing is correct).

0525423281|4.0|What I Liked: 1) In a world of female main characters, Lola is a complete breath of fresh air. She's unique and comfortable being so. She makes a great role model for girls her age. I thought she was refreshing and fun, and she was definitely someone I'd have loved to be friends with. 2) The creativity. On every page you'd find something different and interesting that your imagination can take and run with. Lola is a creative girl and is always dressing up in costume, and her different outfits are so creative and described so vividly that you can see them so clearly in your mind. 3) I loved Lola's dads. They complemented each other so well, and made such a great parental unit. They were the most normal family in the book! Plus, Andy made pies for a living, which makes me hungry just thinking about. 4) Continuity from Anna and the French Kiss. Anna and Etienne were great characters and I was glad to see them in Lola and the Boy Next Door. I may have even said, \\"awe, yay!\\" out loud as I was reading. 5) The cover. Isn't it so cute?<br /><br />What I Didn't Like: 1) The only thing I wanted that I didn't get from Lola was to get to know Cricket better. I thought that he was an interesting character, but I never got the sense that we just knew him very well. He wasn't as developed as I'd have liked. But seriously, that's all. Maybe Lola is just so vivid that she overshadows everyone else.<br /><br />Overall thoughts: Lola and the Boy Next Door is a sweet romance story for young adults with a great main character, and a fantastic plotline. The romance will win over your heart as you follow Lola and her confusing love for the boy next door.

0517548232|1.0|The basic idea of this book basically focuses on the idea of Pareto Efficiency (which is the economic idea that a policy should benefit all or it should not be undertaken).  He takes Pareto Efficiency to extremes and uses it to basically launch into an attack on any wealth redistribution.  The major criticism is that no economic policy could ever benefit every single person.<br /><br />Many of his ideas are flawed:<br />High taxes discourage production: in fact from 1949-79, when highest tax rate was 70-90%, GDP grew at 2.4%, then when taxes were cut (1979-90) GDP growth was 2%.  So in fact high taxes don't necessarily mean low production.<br /><br />Price fixing is not good, even as far as minimum wage should be abolished.  But these price fixing (including rent control) are there for the poor.  Price controls are placed when the free market allocates the poor less than a fair share of a good.  This applies for minimum wage.  Minimum wage is there to protect the poor, not the middle class or rich, who are often not working at minimum wage.  Minimum wage may decrease the profits of a company and increase cost to the consumer, but this allows some redistribution from the more well off to the less well off.  If we abolish minimum wage, it is the poor who suffer.  Cut the minimum wage, people would have to work harder to earn the same amount.  Minimum wage might not be efficient for the rich and well off, but a society is better off when more are protected.<br /><br />Overall, this flawed analysis highlights how some economic policy is there to benefit the rich.<br /><br />Read this book instead: [[ASIN:1595586415 Economics for the Rest of Us: Debunking the Science That Makes Life Dismal]]

B002CGSYNU|5.0|I bought this for my Olympus E-P1 camera (M.Zuiko Digital 14-42mm lens) and it fits perfectly.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.
B006671NPM|4.0|This is a great series. Sad it came to an end. I wish I had seen most of the comments before I bought my copy. I bought it for $29.99 at Best Buy with the Ultraviolet Digital Copy which really sucks. It takes over 4 hours to download the so called digital copy to my computer. I'll have to be more careful in the future not to buy movies with the ultraviolet digital copy. Some ultraviolet digital copies I can't even download because I don't live within the 50 states. It's really unfair being that you pay for the full product and can't even get what you pay for. From now on I want the actual digital copy.
B00632HWOG|3.0|Well - this is a pretty worthless thing with the Yahoo Android App for Kindle Fire. Even the email App cant displa more than 10 emails. You cant even see the 11th email - ridiculuous. However I found a crude workaround - Login to mail.yahoo.com directly from the browser (Yes - do NOT use the App for Yahoo, though it encourages you to use that crappy App) and the you will be able to see all ( however many you have)... Phew !! You have change page but atleast you can see more than 10... Whoever did the App for Kindle Fire should fix this ASAP.  Apart from this I have found Kindle Fire pretty neat - specially te MicroUSB interface( u need to buy a cable) is terrific. I uploaded 100 mpe music files instantly...
B0012GMWCU|5.0|If you are looking for some good upbeat and awesome blues, this is the one to get.  I will not give you a techny music breakdown as to how it compares with other blues performers and/or his previous cds.  I will say that this cd is great, one that you can just listen to while going for a Sunday's drive.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|The faux leather cover is sturdy and has the look of an old leather bound book. The Kindle Fire fits securely in the cover. My only criticism is that the $40 price tag is a bit high for faux leather.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I rented this on a lark because it was $2. I definitely got a good deal on the entertainment it provided. Good special effects, reminiscent of Cloverfield at some parts. I'm not sure if I'd watch it again, but I definitely recommend having a look.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|The last King book I read wasn't just any book, it was The Dark Tower, which was the final book in the series of the same name.  I hadn't picked up a King book after that until this one and I'm not sure why exactly.  If I look back it was probably because I wasn't quite sure I was ready for the intensity that comes with Stephen King novels.  I pre-ordered the Kindle version of this book - the first book I've read on my Kindle for iPad app - and was promptly surprised to see it show up in my list of books.  I started reading it and was hard pressed to put it down.  I've never quite had an author suck me in to the protagonist's life such as King does with his character development.  You join Jake Epping, Lisbon High School English teacher at the beginning of a new chapter in his life.  It's an easy spot for us to join him on his journey for he is at a crossroads with limited responsibilities leaving him free to embark on a journey that will take him (and I) to places and times never before seen.  Jake and I are roughly the same age (he 35 when we join him and I, 33) so it is very easy for me to relate to him when he sees the late 50's and early 60's for the first time.  Neither of us were born when Kennedy was assassinated and while the monumental nature of the event was driven into my head by countless teachers that discussed it, I can't know like those that lived it.  I suppose I will try to explain 9/11 in the same way to my children and in a way, that will have the same 10,000 foot viewpoint that comes with not actually being present for a tragic event.  Anyway, Stephen King drew me in and suffocated me with such intricate details of Mr. Epping/Amberson's life that I found myself wanting to befriend an imaginary person.  He did this with the characters from the Dark Tower and now again with the characters in this book.  I so very much wanted things to end differently for him.  Thank you Stephen King, for welcoming me back to your writing with open arms.  This wasa delightful book and one that I will be sure to recommend to anyone that will listen.

B004GYY714|1.0|None of the stations load properly. They're either 'idle' or play for two seconds and load for fifteen in between every two- second play. What a waste! Maybe it's my phone, but i doubt it. I have an LG Optimus; if you have one too i suggest you NOT waste your time on this app. I really think that this app is nothing more then a cross country radio station index. Most of the stations don't even load.
B0053KWDES|5.0|Anyone who invests in a good set of headphones, earbuds or In-Ear Monitors is only enjoying 50% of the experience of high-quality audio if they do not have a headphone amplifier.  A good amp enhances the full spectrum of frequencies and the overall impact of musical recordings.  Different headphone amplifiers are almost as distinct as different headphones - some have a warmer, more bass-y quality, others are more balanced. The FiiO E11 is an outstanding amplifier.   I own the Total Bit head Amp from Headroom.com, and the PA2V2 by Electric Avenues.  I don't anticipate using them again any time soon. My FiiO E11 arrived about three days ago, and frankly it makes a mockery of the other two amps.  I had already purchased a FiiO E5, a portable amp about the size (and shape) of an iPod nano. For $20, it is a remarkable little amplifier. So I knew the E11 had to be spectacular. I was not disappointed.  I am actually noticing sounds and textures in familiar recordings I have not previously heard.  The E11 has two Gain settings and three EQ settings. The bass enhancement is so powerful that I have hardly used the 2nd and 3rd EQ settings.  There is also virtually no background hiss, which is not the case with the Total Bit Head amp or the PA2V2, both of which actually crackle. Not good.  Personally I think many of the headphone amplifiers on the market are ridiculously overpriced. I highly recommend the FiiO E11 to anyone who wants to rediscover the excitement of listening to music.  It is an extremely well-priced, balanced and powerful amplifier.  Also, I recommend the SRS iWOW 3D audio adapter to absolutely everyone who listens through an MP3 player or iPhone.  The iWOW 3D is without question the most remarkable electronic accessory I have ever encountered.
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|Megadeth is a great band. I hope they release this album on vinyl as well like some of their other reissued records.

098357670X|5.0|Finally a \\"How To\\" book that doesn't feel like a text book. The Mad Art of Caricature is a delight!  Each point is explained clearly and includes many illustrations for emphasis. No matter your skill level you're sure to get a lot out of this book. It's also great just to page through and  marvel at the caricatures for Tom is truly one of the masters!   Over the years Tom has proven to be a great benefactor to caricaturing and cartooning by being very generous sharing his knowledge via his blog. With this book his tutorials are always at your ready without worrying about slow internet connections, server upgrades, or computer crashes! :)  If you're a MAD Magazine die hard, order this book through his blog and you can get the book personalized with a sketch of Alfred E. Neuman (after reading other reviews it seems that URLs get edited out, so do yourself a favor and Google \\"Mad blog\\").
B005LRWRZ8|5.0|This is another album to be added to the Megadeth catalog as one of their best albums. This album marked the return of David Ellefson on bass, which is just one of many positives. Every song on the album is worth a listen. There is no down points on the album, it is solid start to finish. If you are a die hard Megadeth fan this is an album for you.
0385523912|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone wanting to know about the secretive N. Korean living conditions.  It is well written and tells the variety stories of several N.

B0058VA2U4|5.0|First of all, Joey Belladonna is back on vocals with Anthrax!!!!! This album is absolutely amazing. An Anthrax classic. This is just as good as if not better than albums such as Spreadin the Disease and Among the Living. with Joey back it doubles it. any Anthrax fan should love it.

B002ZG976U|5.0|At first, I did buy this a year ago and then my mom kept on borrowing my movie. I decided to give my first copy of the movie to my mom since my dvd player didn't recognize the movie. I absolutely love musical movies and that I thought that I would give it another shot to buy the movie again because I love Christina in the movie. This is my top musical movie that I would watch over and over.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm in decent shape - not overweight or even fat - and this kicks my butt each and every time I use it. It really is a workout, which is what you paid for, right? However, I don't use it daily. Workouts with warmups and cooldowns are about 25 minutes long. I recommend the video if you're trying to build muscle and don't have a lot of time to work out.
B005F3XV62|5.0|I love Kevin James and that I think it is way better then Paul Blart: Mall Cop. Kevin James did an amazing job in the movie and the talking animals are so adorable. I went to see this with my mom and sister for a nice birthday gift for my mom. Absolutely started laughing through the whole movie. I wanted to buy this movie when it came out but I wanted to wait until the movie went on sale. I will be watching this movie over and over again.
B005EVVESM|5.0|Ever since their debut, Maroon 5 has always shown a soft spot for upbeat pop tunes and 2007's \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" hinted that they were taking their music in that direction. The first time I heard lead single \\"Misery\\", I was blown away: there were major dance-pop influences, but what stood out is that they maintained their old rock basic qualities despite the new musical additions. When I finally got to hearing the whole record, I was pleased with the overall result. Almost every song makes you want to dance and all of them have grown on me so quickly...   The contagiously-swaggering \\"Give a Little More\\", the bouncing \\"Stutter\\" and the whistling \\"Moves Like Jagger\\" for me were instant favorites. Other highlights include the singnature song (for me, haha) \\"Hands All Over\\", which is unlike anything the band has ever produced and the ballads \\"Just a Feeling\\" and \\"Out of Goodbyes\\" which features a marvelous collaboration with Lady Antebellum. Even with this refreshing wave of musical reinventing, songs like \\"I Can't Lie\\" and \\"Never Gonna Leave this Bed\\" take us back to 2004's \\"Sunday Morning\\" and their second album's single \\"Won't Go Home without You\\", respectively.   Lyrically, this is the band's weakest album. With a few exceptions, it's the old \\"new clothes, same body\\" sindrome. \\"Don't Know Nothing\\" definitely has had better versions in their previous works. Maroon 5 needs to discover new things to write about before they start going down the same road Avril Lavigne has been taking. Recycling lyrics is not a very clever way to do music. The band needs inovation. Music wise, they're getting better and better. All they need now are lyrics that can fit into their new, updated sound.
B004ZJZQH4|5.0|Outstanding video about this successful failure. I was totally absorbed in the movie. Very moving. Bonus video has actual footage.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I've been a fan of Rihanna since her 'Music Of The Sun' album. Since then Rihanna has become one of the most successful female artist of all time. Trailing only two other females (Madonna & Mariah Carey With The Most #1 Singles In Billboard History). This cd is a work of art! It has to be one of the most versatile albums I've heard in a while. My favorite tracks are of course 'We Found Love'(The 1st Single Which Has An Epic Beat & Video), 'You Da One'(The 2nd Single Which Is A Very Catchy Song With Reggae Moments), 'Talk That Talk' FT. Jay Z(Rihanna & Jay Z Together Are Always Magical), 'Cockiness (Which Has To Be The Most Controversial & Just Might Be My Favorite Song On The Cd), 'Birthday Cake' (This Has To Be One Of The Best Interludes I've Ever Heard), 'We All Want Love' ( The Title Speaks For Itself On This Beautiful Ballad), 'Farewell' (This Is One Of Rihanna's Best Ballads Ever), 'Red Lipstick' (I Can See This Being In Several Drag Shows) & 'Do Ya Thang' (This Along With 'Cockiness' Has Hit Single Written All Over It). Cop it. You won't be disappointed.

B004JK61K0|5.0|My Samsung Fascinate is (was!) next to useless for email.  It seems to take forever, if ever, when I use it--I mean, try to use it--to get mail from my IMAP server.  I've tolerated it only because I didn't get the phone for email, but after just over a year of this, I've come to really resent its behavior.  But, that's the phone, isn't it?  And I'm stuck with it, right?  The client that came with the phone, while perhaps nothing fancy, should at least work.  But, yesterday it struck me that even though the chances seemed slight (see previous paragraph), maybe it's not the phone after all, but the email client instead. I went searching for apps and found K-9, with good reviews, and free.  Why not give it a try?  I did...and it works like a charm!  It's like I have a new phone!!  So, thank you, K-9 Dog Walkers, thank you!!!

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Warner needs to be sued over this.  For 3+ years when we have bought Blu-Rays with \\"+ Digital Copy\\" it has meant the same thing - type my code in and download into iTunes -- Now Warner decides that they can just change the meaning.<br /><br />No.  False advertising.  Fraud.  A Digital Streaming Copy from some fly-by-night company is not what Digital Copy has come to mean.  How do I take this UltraViolet Copy and put it into iTunes so it plays on all my iOS devices and also on my Apple TV?

1594744769|4.0|I thought the book was unique compared to recent books I have read, although the ending was not what I hoped for. I also did not know until after I finished the book and was discussing at book club that it was actually children's literature. Looking forward to the next installment due out in 2013.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|This is easily my favorite case for anything I've ever bought. I wish I had one like this for my ipad. I have no idea what others are smelling but mine odor whatsoever. I bought mine at bestbuy. I simply needed a sleeve because I prefer to hold the device naked when I'm reading, rather than use a cover. Ive gotten many compliments among buisness partners on the case.  The quality is top notch. The leather is stitched well and they have even used YKK zipper's. These are known to be the best zipper made. I find the egg crate style to be more than adequate. It should disperse minor impacts well. I was not looking for a case to protect it from a 40 foot fall anyway. Besides, if you've seen the videos on youtube, you know that the Fire is made of gorrilla glass and virtually impossible to accidentally scratch or break.   Classy quality. Classy look. Classy case.  5 stars easy.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I got this for myself after ordering it twice on cable love this movie love the quality hoping there is a number 5 haha
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I don't know why everyone is complaining about this case, if you expected an Otterbox you are surely going to be let down. But it will do me just fine until Otterbox or Trident decides to make one for the Fire...  It seems solid enough and fits the Fire very well, snaps on easily and securely. It doesn't feel cheaply made to me at all (and I am spoiled with Otterboxes on nearly everything). I have no doubt that it will do a fine job of protecting the Fire from anything short of a a big fall. The screen flap seems just fine to me. And those complaining about its stability when in stand mode, seriously? It is designed as a viewing stand, which means you set it up, launch the video, and then leave it alone. If you try and pound away on the keyboard while in stand mode then of course it is going to fall over, but as long as it is on a flat surface it works just fine for viewing movies and such.  It is no Otterbox (and probably less than half the price of the eventual OB case), but it is a perfectly adequate - and good looking IMHO - case protection-wise, and I will have no problem using it until Otterbox deigns to grace us with their product for the Fire. No regrets here.  5 Stars will be reserved for the Otterbox or Trident when they come out, assuming their usual quality. As long as this case holds up it gets 4 from me.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|Put me down in the camp that considers \\"Tree of Life\\" an unqualified masterpiece. In my opinion, no truly great film is going to get a five star rating across the board, at least not when it first comes out. A film like this is so innovative, so original, and so challenging it's sure to confound the typical dumb*ss American moviegoer.<br /><br />You want a formulaic story, something you've seen played to death already, a film that treats you like an imbecile? \\"Tree of Life\\" isn't for you.
B000006UNF|4.0|The disc is quality but not the best in my opinion. This remastered version with bonus disc and ennobles the work and worth having for those who like progressive rock. The phase of Marillion with Fish is undoubtedly of great value to the rock. Excellent!

B005R4255C|3.0|I've seen 2 Cirque shows: Dralion and Immortal World Tour (both of them I enjoyed the living hell out of, and consider to be the best live theatrical shows I've seen), and will be seeing O and Zumanity in December and Quidam in August. I'm a big Cirque fan and have been since I saw the TV series back in 2006. I am also a Michael Jackson fanatic, and this show was pure heaven for me! I went on the second night here in Edmonton and was just blown away. A fan of Cirque and MJ, the show proved to be pure sex for me, with the remixes of MJ, the creative stage design, the amazing costumes (including the really cool sparkle light suits during Human Nature and the TRON-esque suits during Black Or White), clowns and acrobatics. I thought to myself, THIS is the ultimate tribute MJ deserves.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this CD won't do it for you if you haven't seen the show live. Problem is, this show is like their Delirium show where they had the musicians visible, and they played the music live while MJ's vocals played over the speakers. They had amazing energy live, and it doesnt translate well to CD. If you were hoping to relive the magical guitar-versus-cello duel during Beat It, you'll be disappointed. And missing the visuals and acrobatics doesn't help either.<br /><br />Simply put, if the show is coming to your city, don't miss it, and think that this CD will recapture the magic, because it won't. Like all Cirque shows, it's a real live experience, and one not to be missed. So by all means, do see it.
B0057R5XRG|4.0|I don't Think I need to say a lot about the films because I think just about every person that watches movies have seen these films. The transfers to blu ray look very good I have seen better but they are very good the extras are great. I have never actually owned any of these films and have not seen them in a very long time. So I decided to finally  buy them and I'm glad I did because I love these films they are very entertaining and bring back wonderful memories of my childhood. I would definitely recommend buying them on blu ray.

0385344325|3.0|Although I've read and re-read all the Reacher books, I must say it's getting harder and harder to push myself to re-read the last couple, going back to \\"Nothing to Lose.\\" They're just not sufficiently complex, nor is the writing up to his earlier snuff. (The crypto-Harlequen romance \\"steamy\\" sex scene in \\"The Affair\\" was downright embarrassing.)  That said, I'm committed for life to following Reacher to my or his bitter end. His character is just too unforgettable and speaks to too many of my repressed-by-civilization tendencies to toss aside, even if his \\"Daddy\\" (Childs) is too lazy to git down and replicate his early craftsmanship. \\"The Affair\\" is required reading for we fans, but I'd be curious to hear if a newbie would be able to get hooked by this so-so thriller.
098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond is a true master of the art of Caricature. His art work captures the subject (or victim) not just in form and physical appearance, but in personality and subtle mannerisms.  Tom is an absolute master of the craft, but one of the best qualities of a master is their ability to teach and instill confidence in their students.  The Mad Art of Caricature breaks it all down into easy to follow instruction and concepts without ever dumbing it down. He trust in our ability to learn this and teaches us the basics of structure, line, form that we need to develop as artists. If you are going to learn an art form, learn from the best. This book is class time with one of the all time MAD Magazine greats.  Tom demonstrates that caricature can be not only funny but flattering! I suspect that his art is much sought after by his subjects!   This book is perfect for anyone with an interest in learning or appreciation of the Art of Caricature.
B000G8NXYG|4.0|My only regret was that this DVD is not available on bluray.  Excellent transfer onto DVD though, and the subtitles are terrific and very easy to understand.  The DVD comes with a booklet with very interesting and for myself, hard-to-find information and rare snippets from the master Kurosawa himself and Toshiro Mifune.  Well worth the price!

1846144841|5.0|In 2004, Wall Street's largest investment banks brought about a worldwide financial downturn by creating the credit default swap on the subprime mortgage bond. The events that followed have been widely reported. Once-wealthy nations such as Greece, Ireland, Iceland and Germany accrued gargantuan debts, causing governments, banks and other companies to crumble. In 'Boomerang', Michael Lewis explains the details of how and why this happened, visiting the worst-affected countries and speaking with key players from both sides of the fence (those whose actions caused the damage, and those whose predictions - if taken seriously - could have prevented it). Lewis's snappy prose and incisive wit make 'Boomerang' an enjoyable reading experience as well as an educational one.   In an amusing aside that could be viewed as a prophecy of Iceland's approaching financial meltdown, Lewis reveals that Alcoa, the biggest aluminium company in Iceland, encountered a problem unique to their nation when, in 2004, it set about erecting a giant smelting plant. Iceland's folklore is so all-pervasive that many Icelanders believe in 'hidden people', or, in other words, elves. Before Alcoa could build a smelter, it had to pay a government expert to examine the enclosed plant site and certify that no elves were on or under it. One Alcoa spokesman told Lewis that it had been a delicate corporate situation, as the company had been forced to pay hard cash to declare the site elf-free, but, as he put it, \\"we couldn't as a company be in a position of acknowledging the existence of hidden people.\\"  Lewis cites a 2001 paper called 'Boys Will Be Boys: Gender, Overconfidence, and Common Stock Investment', published by MIT Quarterly Journal of Economics, which found that men trade more often than women, and from a position of worse judgement. The study found that single men trade more recklessly than married men, who in turn trade more irresponsibly than single women. The weaker the female presence, the less rational the approach to financial-market trading. One of the characteristics common to both Iceland's financial collapse and Wall Street's is the absence of women (only one woman occupied a senior position in an Icelandic bank), who weren't given risk-taking jobs. Interestingly, only one woman had a senior position in Icelandic banking in 2005. The woman in question, Kristin Pétursdóttir, quit her job in 2006 to set up a financial-services business run entirely by women, as she didn't like the reckless way men were running Icelandic banks. Her business is now one of very few profitable financial businesses in Iceland. An old man turned up at Pétursdóttir's door one morning with his life savings and the proclamation, \\"I'm so fed up with this whole system. I just want some women to take care of my money.\\" (Please note that this approach is not foolproof - I once tried it with my wife and she spent the lot on cars, designer handbags and shoes.  She's now my ex-wife, for obvious reasons!)  Greece's financial downfall was unique in that it was caused by bankers behaving ethically: they did not buy US subprime-backed bonds nor did they irredeemably leverage their assets or pay themselves inordinate sums of money. The Greek bankers made one fatal mistake: they lent 30 billion euros to the Greek government, where it was stolen or squandered. Michael Lewis points out that, \\"In Greece the banks didn't sink the country. The country sank the banks.\\" (This reaffirms the increasingly popular belief that entrusting one's money to bankers or politicians is unwise...a bit like entrusting one's budgie to a hungry cat.) Unpaid taxes were another main contributor to Greece's financial troubles. No one has ever been punished in Greece for not paying taxes, which is seen as an option rather than a responsibility.  Ireland's post-millennial boom in property development led to debts that were unsalvageable. The Irish banks - most notably Anglo Irish Bank - lent billions of euros to property developers whose construction activities ran amok, despite there being no influx of buyers for these new properties.  Within a couple of years, the developers were broke and the banks had gone bust.   Germany's financial problems resulted from trying to bail out European countries which were in deep financial trouble. In doing so, they behaved in a way that was uncharacteristically unGerman (putting other nations' financial wellbeing before their own). Germany was dragged into financial descent, its downward spiral inextricably linked to the economic fate of countries that simply couldn't afford to pay back the billions of euros they had borrowed from the Germans.  One factor was common to the worst-affected countries (Greece, Ireland, Iceland and Germany): an insistence on burying their heads in the sand and repeatedly proclaiming that all was well, even though their financial foundations were sinking into oblivion. In each case, the dissenting voices of a few shrewd observers were hushed or ridiculed, granting the countries a short-term facade of financial wellness, but making them look foolish, conceited and financially immature when the truth finally came out and the brown stuff hit the fan.  'Boomerang' is an eye-opening book which gives the inside scoop on events that have been - for the most part - covered up. Lewis's world tour of financial destruction is an enlightening adventure for the reader. He tells his tale with a voice of wisdom, humour and humanity.  Well written, immaculately researched and told from a perspective of economic knowledge, 'Boomerang' is a must-read book.
B004H1V5RU|1.0|Opened the box and discovered no marble was placed inside the maze during production. NO MARBLE!! How did that slip through QC? Anyway, I'll post another review when my replacement comes in.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|Sad,just a sad attempt at a remake. So bad in fact,it's not worth writing a long review to explain why. The original was so much better. Watch it if you must,but I bet you will be shaking your head in disgust after doing so.....
B005SMGRAW|4.0|This is the perfect collection for those who only want the Gorillaz they have heard a million times on the radio. Someone like me, who doesn't smoke enough mary jane to enjoy heavy doses of the group. The hardcore fans could probably point out a few key tracks they would have liked included, but those same fans probably already have all their cds anyways and can make their disc.
B005HIEFC4|4.0|Friends with Benefits is the second romantic-comedy of 2011 to cover the topic of the title and is directed and co-written by Will Gluck, whose previous film Easy A was a charming and genuinely funny high-school movie that pushed Emma Stone into the big leagues overnight. Debuting in theatres only six months after the Ivan Reitman's No Strings Attached, both movies deal with the subject of young characters wanting to enjoy a sexual relationship without any emotional attachment or commitment. Comparing and contrasting the two are inevitable. There's no denying that both films are similar and coincidentally the female leads in the separate films are played by Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, co-stars in last year's Black Swan. The similarities are a forgivable transgression since every rom-com that comes out of Hollywood is essentially cut from the same cloth anyway. So, in case the plot isn't completely obvious from the title, here's the synopsis:  In Los Angeles, Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is dumped by his girlfriend (a brief appearance by Emma Stone) because he's \\"emotionally unavailable.\\" In New York, Jamie (Mila Kunis) is dumped by her boyfriend (Andy Samberg) because she's \\"emotionally damaged.\\" Soon after, Dylan is on a flight to New York where Jamie, an Executive Recruiter, has secured a job interview for him at GQ. Dylan accepts the job and quickly becomes friends with Jamie. One night the two launch into a diatribe about how sex is necessary but seemingly impossible without emotional involvement. The two come to a mutual conclusion and make a deal; they will have sex with each other with no commitment, just as friends. You can imagine where the story goes from here. The film boasts an impressive cast that includes Woody Harrelson as Tommy, a gay sports editor for GQ as well as Richard Jenkins, Patricia Clarkson, and Jenna Elfman. There are also cameo appearances by Jason Segel, Rashida Jones, and Shaun White.   Being released in such close proximity with eachother, comparisons between this and No Strings Attached are inevitable. Having seen both movies, I give this one the upper hand. Neither makes any profound statements about relationships or sex, neither are great movies, but Friends with Benefits has more going for it than No Strings Attached, beginning with the chemistry between the two leads. Timberlake and Kunis have far more convincing and striking chemistry than Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher possibly due to Gluck working with Timberlake and Kunis to help shape the characters and the script. Putting more work into this kind of film than necessary, this effort does not go unnoticed onscreen. Romantic comedies live and die by the chemistry shared by the two leads and Timberlake and Kunis have chemistry in spades. They are effortlessly charming with one another and skillfully play off each other's comedic strengths. I was immensely impressed by Timberlake's performance in The Social Network, but found myself underwhelmed by his awkward performance in Bad Teacher. He redeems himself here with his boyish charm and wit. It's easy to accept him as the successful, sensitive young man he portrays.   Harrelson's flamboyant and plain-spoken gay character provides some laughs, but the joke is dragged out longer than necessary. Clarkson, a tremendous actress, brings a quirky sense of humor to her part, although the personality of her character isn't too far separated from her character in Easy A. I'd guess that the character was adjusted to suit her simply because Gluck enjoyed working with her previously. Clarkson and Harrelson do not elevate the material, but they do make it a little livelier.  Friends with Benefits doesn't push the romantic comedy genre too far from its comfort zone. The studio allowed it to be rated R and, with this subject matter, I respect the decision to not cop out with a PG-13. Even with the rating, the sex talk is much more graphic than the sex actually portrayed onscreen. If you take any PG-13 Hollywood romantic comedy and add some dry humping, you'll end up with Friends with Benefits. If Gluck really wanted people to differentiate between his film and Reitman's, he could've been a little more fearless in what he chose to show. The most maddening thing about the movie is that characters openly discuss how every romantic-comedy is the same, following the same meet, fall in love, break up, and get back together pattern. They even discuss the way these films use obnoxiously obvious musical cues to illustrate the tone of a particular scene. Despite how self-aware this movie seems to be, it ends up doing the same thing by following the exact same template. Granted, Friends with Benefits does try to get a bit more serious by introducing a dramatic subplot about Dylan's father (Jenkins) suffering from Alzheimer's and with an actor as capable as Jenkins this subplot is more effective than it should be, but it neither adds to the film nor takes away from it. The dramatic, medical disorder angle worked much better in Love and Other Drugs.   It's totally generic, but has enough charm and wit to keep your attention. There are so many movies like this released each year and such light, forgettable fluff can never be criticized too harshly. I admit to having a soft spot for even the most forgettable romantic comedies, so please read my words with caution. Friends with Benefits is neither a great romantic comedy nor a particularly memorable one, but the charisma of the two leads and the existence of real talent in front of and behind the camera make it worth watching to some degree. It's sappy, clichéd, and far from surprising but it put a big, stupid smile on my face and I couldn't have asked a movie like this for anything more.  GRADE: B
1612680003|1.0|I have a difficult time saying anything positive about this book. Yes, if you are looking to make money, it makes sense to attempt to gather enough assets that can support your lifestyle. However, the author makes it sound as if this is very easy and also makes outlandish claims, including that his net worth fluctuates between $50 and $100 million in a given day. There is no investment out there with such large volatility, as far as I know. Also, I cannot in good faith say anything positive about a book that basically advocates insider trading. There is really no solid information in this book for how to go about building wealth.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|I am surprised that I am actually reading reviews on this episode, or am following this series so closely. I am a college student and am usually a reader. I stay away from television shows because of their lack of creativity and overall quality. This series is amazing. Kudos to the writers.   I think T-Dog's absence is ridiculous also, as another reviewer stated. After the first season and his brief shine when dealing with Meryl, he hasn't really played a part. He barely speaks or does anything. And it's pretty ironic seeing that a black guy is a lead with Rick in the comic. I am suspecting racism or a shift because AMC doesn't think America would like to see a black Tyrese as a lead? IDK we'll see if he is placed in the forefront, or if he is killed off in the next episodes/seasons.  Overall this episode was riveting! The climax was nice. I think Shane's behavior is excessive. It's not just bronze and brute force that's needed in this apocalyptic situation. It is the mind. It's BRAINS, coupled with controlled and concentrated bronze. Shane is good for manpower and for dire, instantly dangerous/sticky situations. Not for planning or anything else that is useful. Oh and he's good at teaching people how to shoot.   Excellent show.
1451627289|2.0|I slogged my way halfway through this book but couldn't force myself to continue. Mr. King needs a tough, literate editor. His writing is graceless and often clumsy. His similes range from laughable cliches to ugly or disgusting. This huge novel should be half its size--he has shoveled page after page of his 1960s research into mind-numbing piles of minutia. And would it be too much trouble, please, to create one major character who is at least half-way likeable? The early Stephen King books contained many passages of sparkling writing. There are few, if any, to be found in this book. As for the plot, it lumbers on at the pace of droplets from a tight faucet. I gave it two stars. That might be too many.

B00129H7VS|3.0|This review is not concerned with Band of Brothers, which is one of the best World War II mini-series I have ever seen.  This review is for the product.  From the image, and price, I was lead to believe I was purchasing a new copy of Band of Brothers on blu-ray.  My excitement from its delivery was deflated as soon as I opened the box.  Not only was this product previously opened but the outside case was dented.  I think all of the blu-rays are intact but buyer beware, you may get a previously opened product.  The only reason I don't rate this product with one star is because Band of Brothers is so amazing.  I have owned this on DVD and wanted to enjoy the series in high def once I got my blu-ray player.  If you are thinking about buying Band of Brothers, do it!  You wont be disappointed.  Just be aware that your copy may not be new.
1451627289|5.0|The magic of Stephen King's writing is that he takes the ordinary and turns it into something spectacular.  Everyone has had the conversation with their friends of \\"if you could go back and change one pivotal moment in the past, would you do it?\\"  Would you kill Hitler before the Holocaust happened?  Would you stop the Titanic from sailing?  Would you stop John Wilkes Booth from entering Ford's Theater?  Or, in the case of this novel, would you stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating JFK?  Jake Epping faces this situation in more than the usual hypothetical conversation. He is shown a doorway into a particular day in 1958.  Each time he leaves the present and goes through the doorway, it's always that day and that time in 1958.  Al, the owner of the diner which houses this miraculous doorway, has used for years it to go back and buy meat at 1958 prices.  Over time he has become obsessed with preventing the assassination of JFK.  He believes that if JFK lives, there will be no Vietnam war and the \\"new\\" present will be a better place.  Jake has his own reasons for wanting to change some things in the past so he agrees to Al's plan.  The problem is that in order to make it to 11/22/63 and save JFK, he has to live through 5 years in the past from 1958 on the day the door opens into until the fateful day in 1963.  This novel combines the best of science fiction, history, thriller and mystery all into one glorious novel.  Jake has to work as a teacher to support himself through the 5 year wait and ends up in some interesting situations.  He also investigates Lee and Marina Oswald to make sure that he is \\"the lone gunman\\" in the shooting and that there is not a shooter on the grassy knoll as conspiracy theorists have long believed.  One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the very beginning when Jake goes to Derry at the time when the kids from the novel \\"It\\" are all still youngsters.  He actually meets Richie and Bev.  It made me feel like we were meeting old friends together as he described them.  I am continuously amazed by the mind of Stephen King.  How could it possibly hold so many fantastic stories? Sometimes the tales are horrifying like in \\"It\\" or \\"The Shining\\"  and sometimes hopeful like in \\"Green Mile\\" but always they are entertaining.  I am a \\"Constant Reader\\" and have been since I first read Salem's Lot when I was in 7th grade.  I continue to be astounded by the talent that is Stephen King.  The sheer size of this book may seem daunting to anyone who is not a Stephen King fan but believe me when I say that you will not regret a moment spent in the pages of this novel.
B002NHIK1E|5.0|This is hands down my favorite show on right now. The characters are great, the plot twists are great, and the actors do a really good job. This TV series is loosly based on the books by the same name written in the early 90's by LJ Smith.<br />The TV series really isn't like the original books, the characters look different, some are left out and some are changed (last names, background stories, ect.). The TV show resembles Stefan's Diaries by LJ Smith more because that book series is being written as the TV show is being aired.

A great read.

I have given this book to friends to share with their families and it is a favorite.

0060936223|3.0|I recommend Just Kids as a way to get closer than most of us were to the scene and people it depicts. But it was hard to get truly drawn in, once we leave Smith's early days in New York, despite the tender story of the two kids who protected each other. There are some really interesting bits of anthropology...the way space is occupied and decorated, the care with which dress and manners are cultivated, the importance of the artists' tools. The death of Mapplethorpe is poignantly told. Smith is an admirable narrator, open, treading carefully, writing with lyricism. Even so, I found myself saying, \\"I should be liking this...\\"
B0007XT87G|4.0|I have already written in other reviews for Porcupine Tree that every album is a unique expression of psychedelic rock- metal - rpogressive rock with very very good sound - production which gives a perfect result. Every album is perfect and there is no exception to this one. Its a little bit darker than other records and a little bit stranger. You have to give it a little tries before you can like it, but it worths the time. Keep it up Porcupine.

B005NS0VNU|1.0|Look, I love R.E.M but this compilation just dips on the second disc. I mean what happened? I realize they included some new songs, but still. Where is Drive, E Bow, Bang And Blame, Strange Currencies, Bittersweet Me? There are videos for most of these songs and they were played over and over on the radio. But, instead you get some other weaker selections through out this disc. It's hard to believe the band picked these songs out. Sorry, I will pass.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you are looking for a SIMPLE Harry Potter Box Set, with all the movies then this is for you! It is cheap and has everything you need in a small box, easy to bring from place to place (for those Harry Potter marathon parties).  This is not a box set filled with special features and all those bells and whistles. If you are looking for that, I recommend you look elsewhere. This is exactly what I myself wanted, as I can never justify spending tons of money for all those special features that I won't even watch, however there are many who like that sort of thing. Make sure which kind of fan you are buying for if you plan on this being a gift to someone.
0385534639|2.0|I really hoped this book would peak my imagination, but it was so slow and boring. I will say the idea is brilliant, but it was NOT a page turner, until maybe the last 30-40 pages when you just want to see how it plays out. The characters are so stiff, many stereotypes, and barely any surprises. It was okay, but very boring and slow. But I do think this author shows a lot of promise and I would read her next book. I was just not captivated at all.
B000003S5G|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best albums of all time. Some tracks on here are just mind-blowing. Not sure where the quality of their music has gone as of late but when it comes to \\"Moon Safari\\" there can be no doubt, this album is far out.

B005N0C0JQ|5.0|With Oasis finally calling it quits after years of sibling rivalries between Noel and Liam Gallagher, we're finally seeing what the lead songwriter of Oasis is capable of without the leash of his brother applying any influences. As expected, the results are very similar to Oasis.<br /><br />In fact, a few of the tracks on \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\" date back to the days of Oasis.<br /><br />With Liam Gallagher taking the remaining members of Oasis with him to form Beady Eye, Noel Gallagher and his new band have essentially released the Oasis album that never was. The lyrics may not be as instantly memorable as those on Oasis' generation defining record, \\"What's the Story (Morning Glory)?,\\" but the choruses each have a knack for sounding familiar on the first listen and encouraging listeners to sing along.<br /><br />Opening with \\"Everybody's on the Run,\\" Noel Gallagher quickly dives into a complete string orchestration to back the standard guitar, bass, and drums. Although the addition of strings is nothing new, even for Noel, their presence gives each track a certain grandeur that, when accompanied with his trademark songwriting style, formulates the perfect recipe for success.<br /><br />Liam Gallagher was the voice of Oasis the majority of the time, but Noel does an excellent job of making listeners forget that. \\"Dream On\\" follows \\"Everybody's on the Run\\" with the most Oasis sounding track on the record thanks, in part, to Noel's best impression of his brother.<br /><br />As the album progresses, Noel seems to feel a bit more comfortable with his voice's own sound, but the transition is so gradual, even the most dedicated of Oasis fans will find it hard to discern Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds from the majority of Oasis' catalog.<br /><br />\\"(I Wanna Live in a Dream in my) Record Machine\\" splits \\"Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds\\" in half with one of the best tracks Noel has ever released, with or without Oasis. Starting things off in a similar fashion to Oasis' massive hit \\"Wonderwall,\\" strings begin to soar over the mix and eventually find a beautiful balance with a choir that leads into a full symphonic bridge section, a high-point of the record and the ultimate proof Noel Gallagher will survive just fine without his brother.<br />Although fans of Oasis are likely disappointed Liam and Noel Gallagher have officially called things off, the releases by Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds are both very enjoyable. Assuming both brothers continue to make music it is possible their bitter breakup may not be as bad for music as originally thought.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"(I Wanna Live in a Dream in my) Record Machine\\"oar over the mix and eventually find a beautiful balance with a choir that leads into a full symphonic bridge section, a high-point of the record and the ultimate proof Noel Gallagher will survive just fine without his brother.

B002BWP49C|4.0|I don't fit the \\"typical\\" Twilight fan, I'm a male, I'm straight, and I turned 25 this year, but I freaking love TWILIGHT. Bella, oh Bella lol.  I was a bit let down with this particular movie, just a little. Only because it seemed like they dragged a lot of the scenes on, purposely wasting film time. I guess to save the best for part two. I hate that they did this to us, even in the book part two was in the same book as part one! But overall the movie was good, I found myself wanting them to rush to the end so I could see how much they would reveal. I won't reveal what happened for those who haven't watched it. I have to watch it again, I couldn't enjoy it, all I kept thinking was part two is better part two is better lol. I'm definitely going to get the DVD when it comes out.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** April 2012<br />Okay so I've seen this movie three times now, I still love Twilight, but this isn't my fav one. Like I said before it was too drawn out and there were a lot of unnecessary scenes in the film. Also the ending was such an Avatar(James Cameron) cop out, it ended exactly the same way! This director could've have done something a lot more creative. Avatar was epic, he should have made his own \\"Epicness\\". True fans I suggest buying the DVD just to add to your collection, everyone else I suggest renting it. If I didn't have every DVD already I wouldn't buy this, but I don't want to ruin my collection.<br />I'm looking forward to November, I'm ready to wrap this up. The last part is the best, if you read the book you know why.<br /><br />Final movie rating is 3 1/2 stars, I put 4 because there is no half stars, work on that Amazon!
B005QI4TP8|4.0|When Florence Welch dropped her debut single, \\"Kiss With a Fist,\\" in 2008, the young British artist earned herself a great deal of buzz around the world.<br /><br />It was a clever tune, similar to the likes of Kate Nash, but what followed in July 2009 with the release of her debut album, \\"Lungs,\\" was so much more impressive. Filled with a lush instrumentation including harps, strings, full choirs and vibrant drums all accompanying her unbelievably powerful voice, \\"Lungs\\" put Florence in the spotlight.<br /><br />In less than two years she was sharing the stage with the likes of Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Hudson, Yolanda Adams, and Martina McBride for a Grammy tribute to Aretha Franklin.<br /><br />Following the success of \\"Lungs,\\" Florence + the Machine returned to the studio with producer Paul Epworth, who produced Adele's massive hit, \\"21,\\" earlier this year. Although the heightened expectations for an artist following a successful debut can often result in mediocre sophomoric efforts, Florence Welch delivers another impressive collection of music on \\"Ceremonials\\" with an even more florid instrumentation than before.<br /><br />Beginning with \\"Only If for a Night,\\" Florence quickly dives back into a sea of reverb-laden pianos, monumental drums, and doubled vocals on the chorus. Although the buildup is less gradual here than on her crowd-pleasing \\"Cosmic Love\\" from two years ago, the song still manages to find a unique balance between power and beauty; proving to fans that Florence + the Machine has plenty left to offer.<br /><br />The first single off of \\"Ceremonials\\" was \\"Shake It Out\\" and it follows \\"Only If for a Night\\" with even more energy thanks to a greater focus on percussion. With a chorus echoing in the distance, Florence wills an invisible crowd to stand up and sing along at the top of their lungs. Although Welch could fill a stadium with her voice, \\"Shake It Out,\\" feels as though it's looking to fill the whole planet at once. With lyrics about moving past your problems and shaking the devil off your back added to the bombastic instrumentation, it's hard not to feel empowered while listening.<br /><br />Although Florence + the Machine typically keep each of their tracks between three and five minutes in length, a little extra time is granted to \\"What the Water Gave Me\\" to allow the music to paint the appropriate picture. Like water, the crescendos on this track come in waves, building and releasing tension throughout the song. By the end of \\"What the Water Gave Me\\" it also becomes clear to the listener what type of record \\"Ceremonials\\" is destined to become. With three tracks each as epic as the last starting off the record with a bang, Florence + the Machine knows what will sell, but with Welch's voice still always the main focus, \\"Ceremonials\\" is an album tailored to her unparalleled vocal projection.<br /><br />Following the success of Adele's \\"21,\\" Florence + the Machine occasionally utilize parts of \\"Ceremonials\\" to broaden their horizons ride on the coattails of Adele's fame. That is not to say Florence + the Machine do not already have enough fans, but Adele's audience seems to be everyone and therefore, Welch uses tracks like \\"Lover to Lover\\" to prove her voice can be just as soulful as it is powerful.<br /><br />Despite offering up 12 dynamic songs that are all individually impressive and beautiful, as an album, \\"Ceremonials\\" feels weaker than \\"Lungs\\" on a straight through listen. The reason behind this is entirely a lack of variation.<br />On \\"Lungs,\\" Welch sang from her heart with a great deal of emotion elegantly laced into the slower tunes. This gave the grandeur of the upbeat percussive tracks some extra significance and turned a simple change of pace into an earth-shattering anthem. Now, two years later, Florence + the Machine have seen the eyes of their fans light up when these anthems are performed and \\"Ceremonials\\" gives them the ammunition necessary to fill a concert with these massive compositions.<br /><br />When played back to back on an album, however, they begin to lose some of their prestige; so much so that tracks like \\"Spectrum\\" and \\"Leave My Body,\\" which both start with slower vocal solos, are almost disappointing when the thump of the drums enter.<br /><br />The word epic comes to mind instantly when describing \\"Ceremonials.\\" For anyone hoping to see Florence + the Machine in concert, this is an ideal release. With so many high-powered tunes to choose from, Florence + the Machine have released an album that will push their live show to the next level. However, when just listening to their recordings, \\"Ceremonials\\" begins to feel like a one trick pony.<br /><br />It's a really great trick though.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Shake It Out\\"heir prestige; so much so that tracks like \\"Spectrum\\" and \\"Leave My Body,\\" which both start with slower vocal solos, are almost disappointing when the thump of the drums enter.

B001UV4XIS|1.0|I always buy the DVD/Bluray/Digital Copy when available. Whenever I go to the gym I like to watch movies on my iPod to pass the time. This new UltraViolet copy requires you to download on Flixter and is NOT compatible with iTunes. Don't waste your money on a combo pack. I recommend just getting the Bluray or DVD... whichever you want. So disappointed that my digital copy is useless.   The movie however is good. As an avid Harry Potter fan I love everything Harry Potter. I do wish the movie followed the book more. I don't see why they need to change something that is already awesome, but that just my opinion, and I still own all the movies regardless.

1451629184|5.0|I've been interested in Jaycee's story ever since hearing about it. I thought her book was really well written. It goes through a lot that happened to her in the years she was held captive and the torture she was put through. Jaycee seems like such a heartfelt person and was really easy to relate to and this book just makes you want to be her friend. I thought she expressed her feelings and confusion throughout her captivity and experiences well. I do wish the book was a bit longer, it seems to skip quite a few years. I'm really hoping that she writes another book on her experiences since being rescued, I think her story can really be inspirational for others.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Finally, after more than forty years, the Beach Boys' unfinished album \\"Smile\\" has been released in its entirety - to the extent possible.<br /><br />\\"Smile\\" was in 1966 Brian Wilson's most ambitious project, and he wanted to create music that was as innovative as that of the Beatles - a group which he both admired and wished to match.<br /><br />Wilson dropped tour-life to concentrate on writing and recording music, while the other Beach Boys occasionally came in the studio and recorded vocals on the new songs.<br /><br />The amazing single \\"Good Vibrations\\" was an indication of directions Wilson's musical ideas took. The single became a huge hit and there were naturally great expectations for the album that would follow.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Wilson broke down under the stress of the high expectations and his own ambtions before the album was completed. In fact, a cover drawn with a charming beautiful colorful front and a back side with a preliminary tracklist.<br /><br />Some of the songs were practically finished, while others were under development when the project was dropped. However several of the Smile songs appeared  on the next Beach Boys albums where the overall musical ambitions were lowered and the other Beach Boys began to take more part in the songwriting.<br /><br />The best of these are now well known classics, especially \\"Heroes and Villains,\\" \\"Surf's Up,\\" \\"Wind Chimes\\" and \\"Vegetables.\\"<br /><br />In early 2000 years Brian Wilson re-recorded the Smile songs and also went on tour with them. Although these were fine and impressive performances, they also meant that the wishes the the original versions, with different beautiful Beach Boys voices, became even stronger.<br /><br />This 2 CD version contains the versions of the many Smile recordings which Brian Wilson believes are the best. CD 1 contains the finished versions of the songs, or in some cases as finished as possible. CD 2 gives a little insight into the work in the studio, and numerous recordings and overdubs behind these contemporary loose shots.<br /><br />Since there never was any final decision on tracklisting, anyone can try to put an album that may match or perhaps overpass the group's previous album \\"Pet Sounds\\" which is considered as the group's masterpiece. I have put such an album together which after the contemporary standards has14 songs and which lasts about 40 minutes. In fact, I think this \\"album\\" in respects in on the level of \\"Pet Sounds\\", which after all also does contain songs of lesser significance<br /><br />Side one of this imaginary vinyl version looks like this: Side one 1. You're Welcome / 2. Good Vibrations / 3. Surf's Up / 4. Wonderful / 5. Cabin Essence / 6. Child Is Father Of The Mon 7. Look (Song For Children) - Side two 1. Our Prayer /  2.Heroes And Villains / 3 Holidays / 4. Wind Chimes / 5. Vega-Tables / 6. Gee / 7. Do You Like Worms (Roll Plymouth Rock).<br /><br />I've played this compilation many times and am very satisfied with it, and I believe it would have received deserved recognition in its time, even if individual numbers may seem a little incomplete.<br /><br />In any rate, this bunch of beautiful songs constitute an important part in  music history.ver was any final decision on tracklisting, anyone can try to put an album that may match or perhaps overpass the group's previous album \\"Pet Sounds\\" which is considered as the group's masterpiece.

B005HQ5S3G|4.0|I LOVE Kelly Clarkson. I think this CD is good, but I still would place her 2nd and 3th CD ahead of this one. This one seems to be a throwback so some of her earlier work. Strong and Mr. Know It All are by far the best songs on this CD. I love her voice and will listen to just about anything she sings, I think I just have a comparison problem. A must have for any Kelly Clarkson fan!
B005G4TJI4|3.0|Pros:    1) I like that there are 3 formats:      - Blu Ray    - DVD disc    - Downloadable Digital copy  2) Dropped on my doorstep quite quick - thanks Amazon (for contracting out the work properly in this case)  Cons:  When you buy a Blu Ray, you usually not just buying the movie.  You've seen the movie in the theater and enjoy it enough to add to your collection.  You're buying it for the content (deleted scenes, alt endings, footage on how they made the movie, etc).  This had squa-doosh by way of extra content.  Booo!!  3 stars.

0061245097|4.0|I love this series. I was a little thrown by the premise of this installment taking place so long after the first. Four years is a long time and I was worried that it would hinder the romantic progression of Bones coming back into Cat's life. Really, I should have feared not.    Bones is almost instantly back in Cat's life. Not back in her bed from the get-go, but back as a fellow vampire fighter and trainer. Though, the love doesn't follow far behind.    I loved getting to know Cat's team. The men are rough and tough and it was interesting to see them at a point where Cat had a new member. It showed the testaments she needed to make to gain trust from the men, but also assured the reader that she was accepted as their leader as well as a friend. Watching the final team member slowly integrate and trust Cat was almost like watching a relationship develop...Gave you the new relationship feeling that was missing from Cat and Bones. Mostly because Cat and Bones aren't new.    Nope, Cat and Bones come to this book with previous expectations. High Expectations. And this book does deliver. The relationship is strong and still growing. Frost allows her characters to grow without changing who they are at their base. The repartee between the two is still strong as is the heat of their love. A little jealousy is thrown in (on both sides) to add a little spice.    Readers who enjoyed the first book will find the same Cat and Bones, just a little older, and a little stronger. Like fine wine they're only getting better with age.    [...]

B0039TD7PY|5.0|I had heard this album from friends who went to the concert!  Had to have it.  I listen to it often in my car...arrived timely and in perfect condition.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|I love this album and think it's great for ages 8-16. My ratings of the songs are:  La La Land- One of my favorites. I love the meaning, lyrics, and her voice and the music in this one. 5/5  Get Back- Pretty good and rocker- type for a Disney star. Another favorite. 5/5  Trainwreck- Another favorite! Three in a row! This one's great and kind of like La La Land in a way. 5/5  Party- ANOTHER FAVORITE? I think my favorite is every song on this album, seriously. A lot of people don't like this song but I love it. It's kind of country- rockish. 5/5  On the Line- Love the chorus. This song is super- catchy and again, a favorite. 5/5  Don't Forget- Also a favorite! So much emotion in this song and I just love something about it. 5/5  Gonna Get Caught- Probably my least favorite of the album. Still OK just not my style. 2/5  Two Worlds Collide- I think Demi needs to stick with more upbeat songs. The song's OK and in my opinion, a lot better than Gonna Get Caught. 3/5  The Middle- A great song! This is where the album picks up again in my opinion. Another favorite, possibly my very favorite with La La Land! 5/5  Until Your Mine- Another good song, but not great. I like the chorus alot, but it kind of makes me think of a war- ??? 4/5  Believe in Me- Love the lyrics, their great and inspiring but I don't like the way the song sounds as much as I do the lyrics. 4/5  Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!
0345529057|5.0|I am glad that I discovered these books after five had been written.  I read through all five books in about 2  weeks.  An amazingly detailed and vivid read.  The author can spend a lot of time describing the banners and backgrounds but it tends to add to the reader's ability to picture the scenes.  There are a lot of characters and I cared what happened to them.  I have not seen the HBO series, I have heard that they did well translating the first book.  I have also heard that it may be a few years before the next book comes out.  I guess I will be re-reading the ones I have and checking back to make sure I get the next book when it arrives.
B004APVI1G|1.0|I couldn't stand to finish watching it, too boring, didn't hold my attention though it was colorful.   I don't know how children could stand to watch it, if indeed then can at all. It went no where fast.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|If you aren't sure what this whole series is about and you're looking for comparisons, mix in \\"Lord of the Rings\\" with \\"The Wire\\" for starters.  George R.R. Martin, who is writing the books for the series, says this story is essentially about the struggle for power. He's noted the darkness of medieval history, how cruel the ruling classes can be towards anyone that isn't them. He's presented these themes brilliantly in the series and the characters he's created to survive these ordeals are deep and interesting. Even the characters presented as evil aren't completely one dimensional; the ordeals, struggles, hurt, scorn, and so on, some of these characters have had to endure illuminate who they are today. It is the singularly most fascinating presentation of a fantasy world that I've ever seen realized.  So what's it about? For starters, the lands in this story are comprised of 7 kingdoms, ruled by one king. The king's second hand man has died and the king seeks out his last true friend, the lord of the northern kingdom (Sean Bean aka Boromir from \\"Lord of the Rings\\") to accept the post.  But strange forces are at work as a long-thought-dead supernatural force from beyond the borders of the northern kingdom awakens and reports of their handiwork begin to shake the rank and file of those who guard the border. The border, by the way, is a 700-foot wall of ice appropriately called \\"The Wall\\", and the men who guard it have to endure winters that can last for 10 years. Winter, by the way, is coming.  The king was not always the king, though. The current king won the throne by leading a rebellion that overthrew the previous king. The \\"old\\" king's son and daughter escaped the fall of the capital and are now across the sea, where the son plots revenge by marrying his sister to a barbarian horselord and, in exchange, the horselord will lead his army across the sea to take back the throne for him.  And what of the conniving family the king married into? The queen, her son (andheir to the throne), her brother, and many who surround the king hail from a different house, a different lord, and thus have their own agenda for the crown.  Politics and matters of small consequence are emphasized here as they provide great backdrop for when it all unravels halfway through the first season, at which point the story accelerates and really hits its stride.  If you enjoy the fantasy genre and enjoy great storytelling, you must watch this series. My 61 year old mother loves it as does my 20 year old niece, as there are characters anyone can identify with and begin to cheer for.  MAKE NO MISTAKE, CHARACTERS YOU LIKE AND DESPISE WILL DIE IN THIS SHOW. NOBODY IS SAFE.  Can't recommend this highly enough.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Fast Five: may very well be the best of the series. Fast 5 brings together cast members from all of the films with the addition of the Dwayne Johnson. This is an action film at it's finest, with stunts that far exceed it's other films. This is a must own for fans of the franchise or for any action junkie. The film is nonstop explosive fun. I highly recommend this film to anyone.
1451648537|4.0|I just finished reading this book. WOW! Fascinating, shocking, entertaining and inspirational at the same time. The book is well written, flows well, and interesting to read to the very end - all parts are interesting. The material is all worthy of being written about, no page fillers. I really liked that Steve Jobs did not edit the book and whatever material was available - good or bad about him - made it into the book.  There are a few gaps in times which are not covered for some reason, and some people in Steve's life not covered as much I would have personally wanted to. For example, there is not that much information about his wife or their relationship in the marriage, only about how they met and got married, but after the wedding, the book barely mentions her until very end where she is by his bed side as he is dying from cancer.  There are also some Apple executives who could have made it into the book, but for some reason have not. It is a mystery why.  Other than that the biography is thorough enough, and the best part about it is that is not glorifying Steve Jobs, it actually exposes his dark side aka reality distortion field as well as his talents. You get a feeling that you REALLY get to know him as if you have met him and worked with him.   The pictures in the beginning of each chapter and in the middle of the book representing different times in his life are well chosen. I went back to them multiple times as I read the book and enjoyed them a lot.  I would recommend this book to all of my friends because you can get cool ideas from it about technology, art or life in general, and get inspired by Steve Jobs on multiple occasions. This book will make you laugh and cry and experience various emotions intensely, or if you are not that emotional, it will entertain you for sure. I think a lot of credit for that should go to the author who did an amazing job putting this all together.   One of the best biographies I have ever read, that's for sure!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This is the Angry Birds of Utilities meaning its one app everybody should own and find reliable and easy to use. its the one app I have purchased for my Touchpad and now my Thrive since it is the one piece of software I can't live without. the ability to access my Desktops and laptops from my tablets reliably and simply makes my traveling with just a tablet possible. one innovative use I have found is using it to watch live TV away from home. I simply connect to my home desktop with the TV tuner card and turn the channel to the local hockey channel and watch the games live without a single problem. the quality of the streaming is excellent and I rarely get any disruptions. truly a great application and a must have for people on the go.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is eye candy left and right. the effects are so cool and the music is great as well. If your a fan of video games and comics you'll have a blast watching this. There's even some recognizable sound effects from games like Sonic the Hedgehog, Mario, and even The Legend of Zelda! And if you love the movie i HIGHLY recommend the comic book set!
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Shazam works great and is quite impressive. I got it when Amazon offered it for free. People who are having issues should not assume it doesn't work for anyone because I've had no problems on my Epic 4G.

B001AQR3JY|2.0|When I first heard that lion king was coming out on dvd I was excited because it was a favorite movie of mine. But now, since Amazon has tried to send 2 copies of it and both weren't working correctly because both graphics on dvd's weren't working correctly and both almost went out on me too so, Maybe I'll hold off on buying it for now or maybe try somewhere else.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|This new album by Kelly is a decent one. Her voice sounds great, and most of the songs are catchy. I only wish Kelly would have written more songs on it instead of passing the reigns over to someone else. She's a great writer and I would have loved more \\"My December\\" type songs and not as many pop songs.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|Ordered this DVD for my husbands birthday. The movie is great! Fast cars, great action and a good cast. Got this from Amazon as they can always get it for me at a few dollars less than I would have to pay in a store.
098357670X|5.0|Tom's book is a must buy because of the huge amount of information and detail on the caricature art form. It's crammed full of how-to sections on caricature drawing and illustration, looking individually at all aspects of the face and more. Also there are hundreds of examples throughout, I don't think there is a single page without a picture. Fantastic quality book, highly recommended.
0345345061|5.0|\\"Smith of Wootten Major\\" and \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" -- two novellas by \\"Lord of the Rings\\" creator, J.R.R. Tolkien -- taste crisp as produce new from the garden, even in this aging paperback edition. Giles, written in the 1930s and Smith, written in his old age, allow Tolkien to remind us again of the good sense and courage of the common man.  Giles ripples with sophisticated humor as the simple villager inadvertently takes on first, a giant thanks to his alarmist dog, and then a dragon, helped by his patient and wise mare.  Animals are as well-written as people in his \\"faery\\" world, where negotiating with a dragon (twice!) sounds like a court-house-steps deal between the S.E.C. and a Wall Street trader, only Giles' deals actually do some good in the end.  Smith reminds us, in a tender and graceful way, that attending to the day and what it brings is a a kind of glory unseen, worth our every effort, even if we live and die in quiet obscurity. No one of us is without value. No matter how humble our good work, our strenuous best counts, it has a legacy that we all live within and share.  Thank you again, Professor Tolkien. You are a true friend.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|My favorite actor just became my favorite blues man. Finding this music on Amazon was quite by accident.I ordered the CD. Two days later I got a wonderful surprise. It was the only music I took on our five-day Thanksgiving holiday. Everyone who heard it, loved it also. They were not even \\"House\\" fans (or blues) as we are. This season has been pitiful. I was ready to say goodbye forever to the show, still am. But I have rediscovered blues through Laurie. His not perfect voice is actually perfect for the \\"worried man genre\\".  Can't wait for his next and would love to know of similar musical offerings.
0316776963|5.0|If you grew up in the 70's you will understand the boring suburban life he led, with only the slight craziness of his family and the pains of grown up to make his life less dull. I laughed out loud so many times in this book, almost as many times as I squirmed from the anecdote hitting a bit too close too home.  This is a winner.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|I agree with the previous comments! It's great and it works! The most important for me is that it is quite easy and is very safe - the profiles are moderated and the people are real! If you know what you are looking for you will find it. Also if you don't know what you are looking for, you might also find it :). Keep up the good work! Thanks for the wonderful app.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I'd put off watching this movie for so long that I nearly forgot I had it.<br /><br />I'd heard so many good things about the original Swedish film this was based on, then subsequently heard of the quality of this American redux. American reduxs of foreign films are often terrible, but I believe this one did its predecessor proud.<br /><br />Superb acting, excellent camera and set work as well as a very good score made this a thrilling and suspenseful watch for me, without feeling disgusted by the gore that was presented.<br /><br />I appreciate horror that allows the viewer to do most of the scaring for themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

0307454541|5.0|Sure, the book is long. It can get tedious at times. But I liked it. The character, Salander, who some are saying has aspergers (maybe, but this label is used way too loosely these days and does not fit well for Salander), is a unique, interesting, vengeful, very moral, and yet violent as all get out young woman. Honestly, I think it's awesome to finally see this type of woman protraying as a herione of a book. She's not pretty (attractive maybe, but always has a crooked smile), she's tough but doesn't keep herself in shape, she's skinny but eats when she's hungry, a genius hacker, loves her mother enough to kill for her, and refuses to be a victim. And yet she becomes a victim. She's not the kick-ass macho-pretty woman like Angelina Jolie, or the motherly type, or the supportive girlfriend, or a bimbo. She's complicated, and smart, and does what she wants and succeeds.<br /><br />Blomkvist is kind of a boring guy. But he is a good counterpoint to Salander,and on top of that, he obviously both likes and respects women in general. Which I think was important to the story. Salander is so out there, she needed some grounding.<br /><br />I liked the Swedish peculiarities. It was way cooler than a boring story set in LA or New York or something. And I liked the 'boring' eating descriptions. For some reason, those just work for me.<br /><br />Although the characters do spend an awful lot of time sitting and thinking, way more than most people I know in real life.<br /><br />A great read, and I'll read it again. It deserves to be a best seller.
B005LRWRZ8|2.0|Let me preface with the fact that I have NEVER written a review on anything before.  This album was such a disappointment that I had to write a short review (grieve).  I must have listened to a completely different album because this isn't anywhere NEAR \\"Youth\\" or \\"Hero\\".  Never mind RIP, or Peace Sells so please stop claiming it's some kind of magical fusion of those because it very much isn't.  The first track STUNK so bad that I honestly initially thought \\"hmm this must be a contract filler\\" because I think it is.  With lyrics like:    \\"While alone and left abandoned  With the sentence you've been handed  All your angels will ignore you  As your life flashes before you  Even still you keep on fighting  Through the thunder and the lightning  And now Heaven sends its love  Your sudden death from above\\"  One doesn't get the sense that this was carefully thought out at all.  There are almost no solos to be heard in the entirety of the album.  \\"System\\" was a far greater musical achievement and that says something.  \\"System\\" was tolerable.  \\"United\\" was FANTASTIC.  \\"Endgame\\"... Meh again.. tolerable.  I don't expect every album to be a new \\"Peace\\" or \\"RIP\\" but come ON man!  This..  this..  crap is like Dave just phoned it in.  The rhythm from almost every song gets stale within 20 seconds.  Bland drumming,  Virtually zero time changes, no solos, and the total lack of any technical prowess were too many knives to the heart to even finish listening to a SINGLE song.  I was eating lunch while I excitedly plugged this CD in clicked play and you'd think by looking at me during the play period that somebody had taken a dump on my spaghetti.  There must be a lot of really young people reviewing this record because in no way, shape or form is it anything worthy of a second listen.    Truly, TRULY disappointing album.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Just got these today. Listening to Mary J Blige. They are light, small and cheap. But, they handle the bass of hip hop music really well. I can hear every note of what is being played. They are not your 199.00 head phones, but for the price and sound quality, I will take this little power house any day of the week. You cannot go wrong with these headphones. And unlike ear-bubs, I don't have to constantly readjust them inside of my ear.

B0057R5XRG|4.0|First of all, could the picture be better?  Yes  But, the picture does have a great amount of detail in it, so it is a step up from the DVD versions.  There is a good bit of noise in the picture, but it's really not bad.  Is it a top-tier release...no.  I'm glad that a heavy helping of DNR was not applied.  While that makes the picture clear, it also removes all details.

B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this game. The controls are intuitive, the look and feel are good. The only problem I have is concerning the ads. Sometimes they won't close and I have to use the Kindle's back button to get to the game. I would be willing to pay a buck or two to have an ad-free version.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Ist season is very good at starting and estting up the relationships and drama of this medical drama series. The writting is off the chart and the action and medical drama are superb. Of course the stories just set you up and pull you in so that you can;t wait for the next season.....as we all know each season gets better and better.
1439152799|4.0|Kate Morton is one of my favorite authors, so I was thrilled when my husband bought me a copy of The Distant Hours. It had all the elements I need in a good story--family mysteries, a beloved book and a castle--at the mention of those things, I was hooked. Upon finishing the book, I wasn't disappointed. While it didn't quite reach the standard that I feel The Forgotten Garden set, it was still an absorbing read.<br /><br />Edie, the main character, was a bit dramatic at times, but it usually felt in keeping with her tendency to day dream and go off on flights of fancy. That characteristic quite endeared her to me actually. I love how her relationship with both of her parents evolved throughout the story, despite her belief that those relationships could go no deeper.<br /><br />I don't mind long books at all, but I felt that plot dragged a bit in the beginning. That was really a minor detail though--just don't expect action from page one, it's really not that type of book.<br /><br />I'm always fascinated with sisterly relationships, having grown up with brothers and not having many close girl friends. The relationship between the three Blythe sisters was touching and heartbreaking at the same time. I loved how the mystery surrounding the night Juniper's intended never arrived to meet them in their castle culminated at the end of the novel. A lot of times I can solve things before the end of a novel, but Morton really threw me for a loop on that one, which was great. While it seemed like their relationship was built on control and jealousy on twin Percy's part, it really ended up being about sacrifice and protection for Saffy and Juniper. Morton's characters really kept surprising me.<br /><br />The one thing that was a bit off putting was the narration style. With Edie it is first person, but the sister's perspective is third person. It just took a bit of adjustment when I first started reading the book, but I know a few people who don't like those narration shifts, so it is worth mentioning.<br /><br />This is one of those books that I can see myself reading again. I am wholeheartedly a Kate Morton fan and eagerly look forward to her next novel coming out.is one of those books that I can see myself reading again. I am wholeheartedly a Kate Morton fan and eagerly look forward to her next novel coming out.
0439023521|5.0|I read this book when it was a new release and pre-ordered the other two when they were first available. This is by far my favorite series that I have ever read. And I read alot :) I wasnt too surprised to see them being made into movies (maybe disappointed) but if I was you, I wouldnt wait, I read the books now.
B006B31B80|1.0|I agree this is boring. I feel like not even watching now. I don't know how they will salvage a 3rd season from this. It feels like an entirely different writer took over. This feels nothing like the first season, it is just boring.  I never would have thought it could be so boring. I mean its a zombie TV series. It is supposed to have action, adventure, mystery. Instead we get drama, completly out of place for the subject. Whiney actors who are stuck in their own self pity.  Drama is ok when done right. They do not do it right here. You can predict every plot twist. They use sterotypical un-original end of world drama. Like should a child be in this world? Sleeping with your husbands best friend. The old religious man on the farm. I am fine with boring story points like this normaly in action films. But this hardly has any action.   They need to fire some of the writers. Get the hell off the farm. I don't even know if I can watch another episode. Kill off the wife and baby, or kill off shane. I don't care which. Kill off the whiney suicidal lady, kill of the cancer chick. Bring in the black guy and his kid. Bring in some new more exciting less melodrama people.   As it stands now I can not recomend this. I doubt I will watch another episode likely I will wait till the end of the season and read about it. If it doesn't sound exciting I will just forget about this entirely.  Dissapointed season 1 was amazing. Best show in a long time. I would rather watch the news that any of the episodes so far of season 2.

B005FISBTO|5.0|Unlike most TV shows that start to fade by the time they reach the Sixth Season, DEXTER is actually better this season that it has been the last few seasons.<br /><br />Dexter actually hit a low spot in Season 3 with guest start Jimmy Smits.<br /><br />Season 4 & 5 got better .......... but it seems Dexter got a fresh injection of \\"Creative Steroids\\" since Season 6 is one of the best of the entire show's history.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|I pretty much agree with the review by S. Hanson. There is real potential for a very gripping story here, but it doesn't live up to that potential. About halfway through I lost interest, and quite honestly, I've forgotten most of it by now.
0451450523|4.0|About the Book:  In the Lilac Wood lives a unicorn but not just any unicorn. She is the last of her kind, and this news urges her to seek the others out. Along her journey, she encounters many hardships and terrors such as Mommy Fortuna and the Red Bull. However, she also makes many allies such as Molly Grue and Schmendrick, a bumbling magician. The three of them eventually find themselves at the castle of King Haggard, where they hope to find the other unicorns.  Review:  After seeing the animated film countless times, I had decided it was finally time to read the novel and fill in those missing or changed details. I didn't miss much. In fact, story wise, the movie is very much on par to the book, which might have been why I didn't like it as much as I thought I would have. I heavily enjoyed getting to learn more about Schmendrick however. In the film, I really could have cared less about him, but upon finding out about his past, he became more real to me. I still cannot say I ended up caring for him perse, but he made out to be more interesting.  The writing style also wasn't entirely to my liking, but I do believe it worked well for the story by embracing its spirit. Of course, it was told in a way similar to that of a fairy tale (though less repetitive). It had many features that are held in your typical fairy tale as well: an evil king, a wandering wizard, a young hero, and even a cursed kingdom with a prophecy.  I ended up liking The Last Unicorn well enough, but it is never going to be a favourite of mine. There was nothing particularly wrong with the book. It's simply personal tastes on this one more than anything, but I'd recommend it to anyone who has a liking for fantasy. Beagle managed to create a classic and original piece while still keeping some well known factors, and that isn't always an easy thing to do.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|The extended version of the Green Lantern is lots of fun and a great action comic book movie. Ryan Reynolds is great in the movie. If there is a sequel, I hope Ryan agrees to do it. I did not see the theatrical version of the Green Lantern. But after seeing the extended version, I can't even imagine seeing a version that is 10 minutes shorter. The extended version of the Green Lantern is a complete movie. Even though I have not seen the theatrical version, it just seems to me that it is a incomplete movie without the extra 10 minutes. I think movie editors are terrible at their jobs. Movie editors really need to think more what scenes are important to leave in and what scenes really are necessary to be cut out of the movie. The 10 extra minutes in the extended version of the Green Lantern movie should never have been cut out for the theatrical version.

1593080719|5.0|Rebecca is worse than I remembered from first reading the book in college. A really bad mother, she \\"hates\\" her son (Thackeray's word) precisely because she is supposed to love him and she does not. Thackeray is really good on how people turn on people to whom they are obligated, whether by virtue of relationship or by virtue of owing a debt of gratitude for generosity and kindness, the hater justifies his or her lack of heart and ingratitude in making the other out to be the villain.  Thackeray is really good on \\"no good deed goes unpunished\\".   does Rebecca murder Jos? That's the impression I got.  As bad as Rebecca is, as dishonest, as lying, as thieving, as heartless, as conniving, she at least feels the need to pretend to the world to be good. Her mask slips when she has no need to impress people because they have no power, as when she is mean to Lady Jane. But mostly she feels she must be a hypocrite. That shows the power of morality in those days. You had to at least \\"assume the virtue\\" though you had it not (to paraphrase Shakespeare?).  After the big Lord Steyne scandal, Rebecca is exposed. Her attempts to rehabilitate herself fail because as soon as people find out about her, they don't want to associate with her anymore. Today, everyone would say, poor Rebecca is a victim. There would be no scandal or disgrace attached to her, though she were ten times worse.   Thackeray says perhaps with $5,000 a year Rebecca could be a good woman. That sum itself, enormous in those days, shows the lie of that statement. I can be a good woman if I have a million a year, it is like saying. As we see in the book most people are not rich yet not bad like Rebecca.   Dobbin is better than I remembered.  He starts out good but stupid.  He ends up very intelligent and worthy of respect by that most severe of judges, adolescent youth, in this case Amelia's spoiled son and his friends. Dobbin is the hero of the book.  Thackeray could not resist having a hero. Thackeray is cynical, but he is not angry.  Thackeray is a critic of human nature. He is not the sort to say I hate the English but rather, unfortunately, people are like this. And just as you think someone is horrid, he shows you that they are not as bad as you think, not as selfish or unfeeling. He is not as cynical as Balzac. He does not break the reader's heart.  Amelia seems to start out like one of Dickens downtrodden and near perfect heroines, like Little Dorrit. But Thackeray lets us see the foolishness and vanity and blindness in Amelia. She is not sentimentalized like Dickens' heroines.  A lot of the book is about female self sacrifice, duty, and devotion which usually goes unappreciated by men and children. But Thackeray does not conclude that this means that women's lives are worse than men's or that they are ultimately less happy.  Amelia devotes herself to her father's old age. The duty is hard for her, but she is still happier than her father who dies a failure in his own eyes. But Amelia gets satisfaction out of her devotion and ends happier than her son's grandfather as well, a selfish and resentful man. He wasted his life in anger. Her life was not wasted. She loved and was loved. From Thackeray's panoply of men and women, it is hard to say who is better off. Women in their relationships seem to have more satisfaction than men in theirs or men in their work.
0385534639|5.0|An enthralling read that keeps the reader attentive and curious throughout. From the start, a second person narrative on your experience  at the night circus to the detailed recollection of the characters journey, the author envelopes you in his magical imagination of the unique circus. For people that are a fan of magic this book is a must however  if u don't like extensive details then this might get a little tedious. Overall a wonderful book that helped me escape a mundane life into one of intimacy, magic and rivalry.
B005KJZDW6|4.0|I was tempted by this album for weeks and finally got it. The download price has been as low as two dollars. It's pretty much everything I was hoping it would be.<br /><br />I think She & Him succeeded here by keeping it simple. They were going for that retro-vibe and hit it right on. Truth be known the only other Christmas albums I own are from Perry Como, Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole and Elvis. This fits right in. Even the packaging is very 1972. Musically I'm not totally blown away, but it's a solid effort and very easy to like. Hipsters and grandma should equally enjoy it.<br /><br />Despite the cheap download, I purchased the vinyl for a few reasons. It comes with a free download card, so now it's on my itunes and ipod, and I burned a CD of it for everyone in the family. The vinyl is also red, and I'm a sucker for colored records. There's a card inside also, but not reusable. Cool I guess. Some reviewers complained of the sound. Seems fine to me.<br /><br />Finally I got they vinyl so I could have the largest photo of Zooey (She) as possible, and the back photo is even better. I can only stare at Bing Crosby for so long.
B001LXIDVS|3.0|As a diehard fan of the original BTTF, I was totally disappointed when I saw its two sequels in theaters back in the day.  I thought both were nonsensical (as if a movie about time travel is practical) while superficially trite, but through the years I've mellowed a tad.  After repeated viewings of this third and final installment, while I still find it embarrassingly silly with its relentless shark jumping, I still have fun watching it.<br /><br />The primary focus of my enjoyment is the comedic mayhem of Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown, and Thomas F. Wilson as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.  As the third installment finds the characters in 1885, Lloyd and Wilson have the lion's share of funny scenes, as Doc Brown adapts to his techno-depraved environment, while 'Mad Dog' aptly demonstrates why he is the originator of the Tannen line of bullies.  Both actors are genuinely funny, and make the most of what they have to work with, which periodically is hemmed in by contrivance and plain silliness.<br /><br />Michael J. Fox is fine reprising his role as the determined Marty McFly, yet I was rolling my eyes as he doubled as McFly's great-great-grandfather Seamus McFly, with Lea Thompson playing Seamus's wife (obviously, the filmmakers needed something for Thompson to do).  This thin ploy never really worked.  And Doc Brown's love story with school marm Clara (Mary Steenburgen) is never fully vetted or developed.  The Jules Vernesque ending is another layer over the top, yet despite all these misgivings BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III is a fun way to say goodbye to an entertaining franchise.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|If your into Metallica then you might like this album. It's not a bad album but if your not into Lou Reed then you might not want to buy this album. The album does rock.

159420229X|5.0|Usually when I'm reviewing a product on Amazon the purpose is to prevent others from wasting their valuable time and money the same way I did.  (How many 5-star reviews does the iPad really need?  We know it's great already!)  But I was so impressed with this book that I felt compelled to add another 5-star review (the 113th as of 11/28/11) of this truly remarkable work.  Let me start by saying that I knew absolutely nothing about the world of memorization and mental athletes when I picked up this book.  But once I picked it up I couldn't put it down.  Not only is the subject matter fascinating but the writing is outstanding.  There is a definite arc to both the narrative about the author's preparations for the US Memory Championship and his far reaching examination of cognitive science and memory's place in our culture both past and present.  Foer's gifts as a story teller and reporter are immense.  Could he be this generation's Michael Lewis?  Whether you pick up any of the memorization techniques or not, this is a book you won't forget.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case came as expected but even after receiving it I found that I wanted a bit more out of it. Overall, it is a sturdy reliable case but sometimes it is difficult to get it to stand properly. I think this is probably because it is a newer case and will work itself in with time. Definitely doesn't add too much bulk and will work well for storage in a purse or small bag.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|Simply put, if the Garmin Software wasn't so good, I would have given this watch a 1 star rating.  If I had paid full price for this watch, I would be very upset.  Since I paid $150 here on amazon, I am not terribly upset.  Decent product for the price.  I love Garmin products, but the bevel on this watch leave A LOT to be desired.  One drop of sweat and the watch starts cycling through options and other menu screens.  If your hands have sweat on them you cannot properly scroll through the menus either.  When I run more than a couple miles I have to set my watch to one view and then \\"lock\\" the bevel.  Having to press both side buttons at the same time while running is not the easiest task.
B0062P3392|5.0|In 1980, a wealthy Omani business man in exile hires retired contract killer Danny, played by Janson Statham, to kill the SAS soldiers who killed his sons.

It also contains one of the best fight scenes on film.

B004PHE9F6|5.0|This edition of the landmark film Grand Prix is truly worth owning. I find the picture quality captures the feel of film, with gorgeous colors, incredible definition, and a noticeable improvement over the excellent DVD version.  I show it on a PS3 on a 46 inch Sony LCD about one version back from the newest on the market.  Hardly an exotic setup.  It has such a mood and feel that casts a spell, its absolutely beautiful to watch.  Actually I would say, magnificent, jaw dropping, stupendous. I have seen Blu-ray movies hardly better, or not better, than the DVD of the same movie. This one looks so much better, its like a print from a 6x9 medium format film versus a 35mm film. It has the big screen look, and one catches the glimpse of a reel change at one point, I swear. This is not just a movie, its an experience.  Nothing like this will ever be made again.  You can imagine what Bernie E. and company would want ($$) for this kind of access today!  And going right into the REAL FERRARI FACTORY with a film crew today, sure, right, at what price?  Don't hesitate, buy this Blu-ray. A visual feast!
B0053TMP24|5.0|The Son of Neptune is a thrilling adventure. A perfectly paced storyline...not to mention hilarious humor and jokes.

My compliments to him.

It is a good accessory if you want to store your kindle fire and never use it. Not designed for quick removal and use.    After returning it, I got the spalsh folio leather case, it much better and no issues so far.
0307891372|2.0|This review has a wealth of information at over 600 pages. Everything is as advertised. I thought since I bought this book I would not have to use the Internet for walk throughs, but I was wrong. I still have to occasionally google something bc it's not labeled in the index. There is a section in the book labeled side quests, but it is 80 pages and the first time I tried to look up a side quest by name, it wasn't in the index, I don't want to have to look through 80 pages to find something that takes 5 seconds to google.
1419702238|5.0|Buying this book was like a Christmas gift to myself because it makes my job as a reading tutor so much easier. All my students love the sly humor and willingly read much longer than any other book I've found. Unlike some other kid-friendly books it has a minimum of misspelled words, like \\"gonna\\" for \\"going to\\", so reading it is time well spent. Plus it's funny for adults too; I end up reading the Wimpy Kid books over and over because so many of my students love them, but I laugh every time.
B0061S073A|5.0|Amazon's [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]] is a great value at $199, but there have been some concerns expressed within the Kindle community. Three common issues:  * The Kindle Fire's Carousel displays all of the books in your archives, and recent websites visited (although you can remove the latter). That can be awkward when someone else wants to see the device, and makes for a very busy screen  * The Kindle Fire doesn't have a built-in way to limit purchases (except for in-app purchases)  * The Kindle Fire doesn't have a built-in way to turn off web-browsing, which is a concern for some parents and other legal guardians  Kids Place resolves all three of these issues.  The app lets you create a new \\"homescreen\\", and control what apps are on it. You can also turn off web browsing (which also prevents purchasing). Access to unauthorized apps is controlled by a user-created PIN (Personal Identification Number).  I did have a few navigation quibbles, but they were far outweighed by the value of this app.   Parents will appreciate the options it gives them.  Everyone will enjoy being able to open to a clean screen with just the things they want displayed.  If you own a Kindle Fire, this is an essential app...whether or not you have kids using the device.

B005GVA2L0|5.0|Musically, this album is amazing!  Every single song is awesome. Sometimes you'll find only a few songs on an album that you'll like, but not this one. Every single one is incredibe and makes you want to listen over and over again. I have to say that, in the beginning, I couldn't understand Amy's words.  Her vocals seemed to be purposefully engineered/produced in that fashion, where the sound of her voice was like one of the instruments.  Beautiful sound. It wasn't until I pulled out the lyrics sheet and followed along to memorize the words that I could finally differentiate them. Oddly, now I wonder how I couldn't understand or hear them before, like the lyrics were muffled somehow. If your a fan of drums, there's more here to enjoy. He's broadened his horizon, shown us how talented he truly is.  He got away from your standard beats, thank God.  More rhythm, way more fun to listen to.  My opinion, the drums in every band can make or break a band or a song. Their job is to make the band sound good, and it's definitely a success here!  Guitars and bass...fantastic!  Amy's piano and new harp....fantastic addition.  Everything....amazing!!!  Can't wait to see them live someday!  Would love to meet them....wonder if they do meet n greets....

B00122Z7NK|5.0|The small French dance duo, Gaspard Augé and Xavier de Rosnay, became notable to many others in the United Kingdom with \\"Never Be Alone\\". This \\"Never Be Alone\\" totally makes you dance. Soon after that all the remix offers followed. Then the group was soon deconstructing and re-pumping tracks from Franz Ferdinand and Britney Spears. The burgeoning direction of Justice's dance vision that they just released their own record (the superb Attack Decay Sustain Release) admired many artists, all while riding on a wave of UK club hits.  So it's not surprising that Justice's debut disc, Cross, emerged shortly after. Together, they're signaling a return to the roots of why dance music got so popular in the first place.  It's refreshingly light in approach. Justice obviously doesn't take themselves too seriously as one can tell by tracks like \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\". However, that doesn't mean they lack substance. Although one can never be sure, it doesn't seem like the work of a one-hit wonder. For one thing, there are a number of strong tracks on the album. Most importantly they have an original take on the electro-glam sound, which is so popular these days.   Yet some other critics have mentioned some negative thoughts on this French duo. A lot of reviews compare this to Daft Punk, but I truly believe that those comparisons have more to do with the fact that these groups are both French duos working in the same genre. It is possible that, maybe, there are more similarities than that. Yet Justice is not nearly as repetitive as Daft Punk tends to be. Moreover, in my opinion, the songs of the Justice are more gritty and dirty. Above all, people have to resist this temptation to pre-judge them based on the feelings about Daft Punk. Listeners should hear them as their own group. Some might say that Justice is a mere copycat, however this should not be the case.   It was extremely enjoyable to hear how they mix repetitive noise and dissonance with such catchy melodies and pop hooks. \\"Let There Be Light\\" is brutal, but compelling. By all means, it will definitely be appealing on your ears. It will make you just want to dance. While the rhythm is tight, there is this fantastic feeling of looseness as if the instrumental parts were not entirely quantized on a grid. Because it is not quantized, the overall feeling of the sounds is not heavy at all. In my opinion, I think this feeling is extremely awesome and important part that all techno-sonic music should have. The lack of rigidity seems to be one of the key factors in the very danceable nature of this disc.  This album, Justice's Cross, has mixed the best parts of the all time music. The beautiful sounds of orchestral strings from 70s with the robotic sounds of synthesizers from 80s were brought toghether. In addition to that, the exciting beats from the early 90s were mixed with the bass of the late 90s. This mixing of all genres turned this into a masterpiece. Even though that sounds from 70s and 80s might be out of fashion, the Justice did an awesome job. They managed to clean it up and extracted out the best out of it. The whole thing will leave you electronically satisfied, for sure.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|It took a bit of time to fully grow on me, but it's become my favorite Arctic Monkeys album (in terms of listening to it as a whole album.)  I love the first two records, found the third to be a bit uneven but interesting, but I feel like this is a more confident statement by the band.  It's a well balanced record with a nice range of tunes.  Great stuff.
0062060554|3.0|The subject matter and idea for the book was interesting enough.  However, after all the great reviews I was left dissapointed.   It really dragged in the middle and then it felt rushed to wrap it up in the end.  Most of it didnt seem realistic or plausible.

B002FE5XVK|3.0|I owned the DVD before, and the content is absolutely reference.  Great concert, made me more of a Talking Heads fan that I was before.  From a Blu-Ray perspective, I have the following comments:  1.  Video is horrible.  I can't speak to the limitations of transferring from an older source, but if you're expecting quality video, don't.  I saw virtually no difference visually from the DVD, and I am someone who would notice and care about high def.  2.  Audio is outstanding in many ways, but two complaints:      Studio mix is out of sync.  I played it over and over and in different players to verify, and the studio mix is not in sync with the video.    Not enough separation in the channels.  I have heard this concert in a CEDIA conference, and the distinction on the bongo drums on Burning Down the House were just  exquisite.  I was expecting this on the blu-ray, but it was disappointing.  This concert is so good that I would consider owning it despite its limitations.  The content is top of the line.  I am strictly giving this rating for people like me who want and expect an appreciable improvement buying the blu-ray.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I recently saw a revival of this film at the Chinese Graumans theater in Hollywood with 3 of the actors involved present (Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiras & Rita Moreno) but unfortunately I was 2 rows from the screen plus at an extreme right angle that it became a chore to view the restored version. A few people left because of this uncomfortable position but I hung in there until the finale. With the purchase of the Blu-ray version--it beats watching it in a theater!!  In fact the picture quality is superior to what I saw that night.  Yes, the disc is not totally perfect but it's not the fiasco that some of the reviewers state.  The opening shots of NYC offer some shimmering but afterwards, everything is perfect!!  So for those nitpickers, shame on you because this is as good as it gets for a 50 year old film--and that's a lot since I saw it originally in 70mm a few times--and this transfer is pretty close to what I saw originally.  Recommended for music buffs and Natalie Wood fans alike (she had a banner year with this film and \\"{Splendor In The Grass\\").
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was one of the best novels I have read all year.  Definitely a slight change of pace for Mr. King, but I must say I loved it.  The characters were ones you easily fell in love with.  I even shed a few tears throughout the book.  I really loved the history and nostalgia of the story.  I will say, the book was quite long but was well worth it to develop the characters and story.  Again, I recommend this for anyone who wants to be transported back in time and want to enjoy a wonderful story.
B0039RDWOW|4.0|I thought that The Checklist Manifesto was a great read. The author told some impressive stories of how and when checklists were applied by people who worked in the medical, aviation, and construction fields. I have already identified areas in my life where checklists can be used such as my career, projects, and routine tasks. Knowing how and when checklists should be applied can help me manage an array of tasks. Like the author stated checklists should be used as an aid and should help rather than hinder.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|(Not much to say as the movies has been reviewed by others)<br /><br /> I didn't know what to expect at first but as I got into this candid story, I could really feel a warmth that reminded me of how original movies were back in the days.<br /><br />p.s- remarkable acting by the kids.<br />You should check it out.

0321704452|4.0|At first glance or from reading the title, I assumed that The Naked Presenter was about imagining your audience in the nude while presenting. It's about being yourself, tapping into and showing your emotions and not hiding behind technology or the podium to deliver an impressive presentation. It covers how to continually evaluate and improve your presentations through three concepts: restraint, simplicity and naturalness. Reynolds discusses that nakedness refers to connecting and engaging with your audience, putting your audience first and being transparent, allowing yourself to be vulnerable and exposed.

0156027321|5.0|I had to read this for English, but I didn't mind.  Life of Pi is an fascinating book about love, god, survival, companionship and faith. The writing and detail in the novel is incredible and even though some parts may seem fantasy - even too fanatical to believe - despite what Pi claims, it is a story for all ages and all generations. It is an age-old story of the trials of human and animal behavior.  Even though we tore it apart in class, I greatly enjoyed it as a story on its own.
B003B02O7I|5.0|John Grisham is certainly the author of the best books on the shelves today.<br />I just finished the Testament,  and had a very satisfactory feeling when I read the last page.  He has a way of getting the reader immediately involved in the opening pages,  engrossed in the way the plot unfolds and twists,  and  then,  like a good coffee and dessert,  a pleasurable feeling at how it wraps up.<br />  The characters are terrific.  The middle age attorney struggling with addiction and self worth,  his friend who gives him another chance to redeem himself,  the  quirky children of the billionaire,  and the missionary deep in the stone age culture of South America.<br />  This proves to be a quest on so many different levels.  I hope you will read this fine book and get as much pleasure out of it as I did.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I read a lot of hype on this book before I decided to finally see what it is all about and buy it. Usually, I am a science fiction/fantasy reader who delves into mainstream fiction only occasionally.<br /><br />  I was blown away.<br /><br />  The book started a bit slowly as far as I was concerned, but then I realized that the author was actually introducing characters in more depth than I was accustomed to, and as I read on I realized that without that dedication to character development I would have been far less invested in what came after.<br /><br />  The writing is tight. Very tight. The story grips you and carries you along in its wake on a roller coaster ride of almost constant slight of hand and revelation. Like peeling an onion layer by layer, except what lies below is not always more onion, but upon occasion, surprisingly enough - cabbage.<br /><br />  Lisbeth Salander is a captivating, sympathetic character. She is a genius, and in my eyes entirely likeable in a - screw with me and I'll break your knees with a baseball bat, kind of way.<br /><br />  This is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read in my life, and I have been an avid reader for over fifty years. This story has all of the elements. All of the 'must haves' that goes into pushing a work from a good read to a great read.<br /><br />  Loved it.
0446547654|2.0|I have always enjoyed Nicholas Sparks books. Yet, lately they have failed as anything remotely interesting, when they are so predicable. I mean a lot of love stories are very predictable and we still watch them and read them. This is beyond that, I mean why do (SPOILER ALERT) the bad guys get to survive and the good man dies, all the while we know what will happen, blah, blah, blah.. Try something new!?!  On other note your past books, have always been great. I really enjoyed \\"The Wedding!\\"
B003MC5N28|5.0|I love this book so so so much! I love the customs that they go through and how everything they do is controled.  I really wished that the second book (Gathering Blue) was directly related to this one. The third book is suppost to tie the two books together so I hope it's really good!!! :D
B004A8ZX28|5.0|really good money. i bought this on amazon black friday thing they had going on and great movie. glad i bought it. ill probably watch it again soon! :)
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Ok, I have only had this case for a day but I LOVE IT!  It seems very stong to me and lightweight.  I am having no problems with it standing and my strap seems to be on very securely.  Maybe one reader received a dud and should send it back.  I see plenty of good reviews here and I am glad that I purchased it.  I will now go order one for my sister.
1451648537|5.0|I bought this book on a whim. Neither an \\"Apple fanboy\\" or a biography person, I really never thought I'd finish it. Instead, I couldn't put it down. It is a masterfully researched and narrated book that doesn't sugar coat any flaws of the man that built the most valuable corporation in the world. Next time I buy an Apple product, I'll know that Steve Jobs didn't berate somebody during its making, but I'll also wonder if that new product will change the world like so many of his products have.
B0057UA4FY|4.0|Love the movies and options on the DVDs.  However, the case/holder is a piece of junk and they constantly fall out!!!
0756405890|3.0|Plain and simple, the book is OK.  There is nothing here for a regular reader of fantsy novels and this is certainly not a viable entry point for those delving into fantasy for the first time.  Sure it has the elements of a fantasy novel but that alone does not a fantasy novel make.  A few quick points:  1) Absolutely, positively do not read this book immediately after or even within the same year or two of having read any of the Ice & Fire novels...you will be left wanting badly.  2) The book is written as a flashback which is to say that you know that the primary character is never in any real peril, and leads to a lack of emotion about him during whatever trials he may face.  3) Its wooooordy and not the good kind.  As opposed to intrigue and a deep plot that requires explanation and point of view, the words are spent on descriptions of emotions and ideas that do not really play on the plot.  In the end I thought it was worth the read but just barely as there could be an interesting world being built in there.  This is the type of book I would read on a commute to and from work, not one that I would read purely for pleasure on the beach or my porch in the afternoon.
B001UV4XIS|2.0|Saw this movie twice in the theaters, was given (I confess) a Russian bootleg copy before this release, and then bought this official release happily.  Problem is, the DVD transfer is horrible -- sure, the films are dark, but half of this DVD is so dark I can barely make out what is happening.  Had I not seen it several times before I would not have known what I was missing -- frustrating!!!  It ain't my TV, other movies look fine.  This needs to be redone more carefully.  A real bummer.  My bootleg copy is visually flawed, but I swear this is worse.  I call a do-over!
B002VPE1XE|4.0|This is a larger camera case than you would need for a compact digital camera.  Most digital cameras currently sold in the $100 range will slide around in it.  My older Canon Powershot A590 - while inside its own smaller padded case - all fit easily inside this case, with no velcro fastener issues.  I measure the inside at 2.5\\" x 3\\" x 5.25\\", plus it is a soft case so anything similar to that should fit fine.  The main flap velcro is about 1\\" x 2\\", so should easily stay closed until the velcro starts to age.  The belt clip velcro is about 1.25\\"x1.325\\" and is quite secure unless tugged very hard.  It can fit a belt up to 2\\" wide.  The case is padded on all sides with separate pads, but the edges and corners on the front and back are left unprotected.  However, the back has a seam that helps make up for it, and the fold-over flap helps protect the front.  Also, the sides on the top are open due to the fold-over flap.  Thus, you can't completely rely on the padding to protect a camera if dropped as the camera could land on an unpadded area.  That said, the pads are thicker than most cheap padded camera cases.  The tiny ring on the back has a wrist strap, or the ring could be used with a hook to attach to a waist pack or something similar.  Not bad for a cheap camera case if you want something a bit larger than a typical digital camera needs.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2Q1CL6QIJAFLB]]Lightweight, decent quality and a good deal. In the video I cover all the features, size, etc. I should have mentioned that it holds two Gopro Hero housings comfortably and keeps the lenses scratch free.

1400069181|5.0|This book has the potential to change the world even more than TOMS shoes and sunglasses.  I have wanted to start a business that would allow me to address global poverty.  I've already adopted a poor village in Kenya, along with some families from my neighborhood, and that has been a life-changing experience for me.  However, since we first started the partnership with the village, I have wanted to do more--to take the next step.  For the past several months, I have started to think that the next step would involve me starting a business, so that I can be much more engaged in addressing global poverty.  I am not, however, an entrepreneur; but Blake Mycoskie is, and his new book is all about helping people to start something that matters.  A great deal of the book's focus is on starting for-profit businesses that give back.  He also talks about starting other things, such as non-profits and volunteer movements, but the business focus is what excites me.  This book is incredibly inspirational, and more practical than most that I've read on the subject.  The topics are high-level enough to be generally applied to different businesses, but low-level enough to provide practical steps that can be taken right now, to begin moving toward starting your own business that will change the world.  I've been thinking about this topic for a long time, and I have more clarity and direction for how I want to move forward with a new business, than I ever have before-and I'm excited about it (and scared out of my mind at the same time)!  Do yourself a favor, and get a copy of this book.  As you read it, open your mind to the possibilities of how you could let your passions out, and change the world.  You have those passions for a reason-don't rob the world of them!

B001AQTWF2|5.0|was looking for a specific song and it was on this cd. recieved it as stated and product works well
B006BQI1V2|5.0|Extraordinarily moving film.  It uses past and present and ties them together seamlessly which has the effect of keeping the story with you even after you are done viewing it.  Kristin Scott Thomas is amazing, as usual.  Many films try to translate a book to the screen and have questionable results.  In this case, the film shines all on its own.  Have some tissues handy, though.

0385504225|1.0|Although, I believe Dan Brown's books to date have been mildly enjoyable, I found this book appallingly bad.  It was formulaic, plodding, manipulative, and left me with the feeling that he had a stroke while writing this.
0071762345|5.0|Dave Kerpen's book is not only well-written and easy to follow, it's very practical and encouraging. I found myself grabbing a pen and paper about every two minutes as I read through it, because I was able to take away so many actionable ideas. Dave does a great job of weaving tons of real world examples into the points he is making, both from his experience as a consumer and as a social media practitioner. I finished the book with an overwhelming sense of optimism about my own future using social media for my business because of all Dave's great tips.
0393064476|4.0|As an admirer of \\"De Rerum Natura\\", my main aim in reading this book was to learn of the discovery of the manuscript. I wish there could have been more detail on this point, but I suppose that the author presented most or all that is known. My interest in the discoveries of other ancient manuscripts (or copies) is piqued and I'll be looking for more on that topic. Besides the description of the discovery of Lucretius' work, the rest of the book is background on the 15th century papacy, description of the eventual distribution of Lucretius' work into the intellectual world of Renaissance Europe and beyond, and examples of its effect on major thinkers such as Montaigne.
B0068TJLSY|5.0|This movie is imaginative and adventurous, yet delicate, with subtleties that other films fail to achieve.  It hit on all the things that are really important- Well written, filmed and directed superbly, and acted to perfection by characters that took their roles seriously enough to get them right without overdoing it.   This movie impressed from beginning to end and will stand the test of time as a coming of age film.....with a syfy twist.  There are a few negative reviews on this film, and I am convinced that those people just didn't 'get it'.   Hopefully you will.....Enjoy!
B004WR125O|5.0|This sets up very fast and I was listening to music in less then 10 min. there is so much verity
B005J29HCQ|5.0|What a remarkable two-disc treat! Even if you've had no prior exposure to the Beach Boys, get this album...it is like nothing else they or any other rock group have produced; a splendid blend of harmony, creativity, melody, lyrics...and on disc two, lots of bits of the performers starting, re-starting, commenting, planning, composing. A work-in-process that finally is out after 44 years. It's a great companion to the equally-remarkable \\"Smile\\" issued by Brian Wilson seven years ago. How often does one get to listen in on genius at work? Now, I'll be hoarding all loose change to save up for the nine-disc collection. Move over Beethoven; I've got more company to work alongside..

B004927I50|5.0|First off, I wasn't always a Swift fan.  I originally brushed her off as just another cookie cutter pop singer.  Then \\"You Belong With Me\\" hit the airwaves.  I LOVED the song but didn't want to admit it.  Then I heard \\"Our Song.\\"  So infectiously catchy...still wanted to dislike her but getting harder to resist.  Then came \\"Teardrops On My Guitar.\\"  Game over....I was officially a fan.    It's hard for a 25 (close to 26) year old guy to admit it but I truly LOVE Taylor Swift now.  I have all 4 of her albums (including her Xmas one) and I just can't get enough of her.  She truly has talent that is heads and shoulders above 90% of her musical peers.  I recently went to her Speak Now concert and found out she could not only play the regular six string guitar and banjo, but she was amazing with the 12 string and the piano too!!    Her Speak Now album is her first album where she wrote every single one of her songs by herself and it shows in both good and bad ways (but mostly good).  I find the songs to be much more honest and as such, some of them just aren't quite as catchy.  (Haunted and Last Kiss come to mind).  BUT Swift truly shines and stands out in her other songs (Mean, Speak Now, The Story of Us, Better Than Revenge, and ESPECIALLY Sparks Fly).  That one line is simply ingrained into me and is just soooo touching \\"I'm on my guard for the rest of the world but with you, I know it's no good.\\"    Simply put, if you're a fan of her 2 earlier albums, you will love Speak Now.  The album as a whole is a bit more mellow and less upbeat but you can really hear Swift's talent and slow maturity in every one of her songs on this album.  Please support artists such as Swift and John Mayer who actually have real talent and turn off all the lady gaga, katy perry, miley cyrus crap.  -Openly proud Taylor Swift fan
0880796863|4.0|This is the original deck.  It is an interesting setup, If you collect decks I would suggest you get one.. If you are reading I dont think it would be so good unless you have a holder for the cards.  the box it comes in is large so it is not like the other decks that have thier own case.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Looks and feels like real leather and did not have any problems getting my Kindle fire in the cover as some other reviewers did. Other reviewers commented that it doesn't fully close. I agree that it doesn't but we're talking about less than a quarter inch. It not noticeable unless you're looking for it. I have gotten tons of compliments and would recommend without hesitation.  ***UPDATE***  So after having it for a few days it seems to have softened a bit and now closes fully. Looks Great!
1451648537|3.0|Being a fan of Steve Jobs, like everyone else reading this book, I anxiously awaited this book.  It's a gripping story and reads like a narrative, so you get a chronological history of Jobs's life.  With that in mind, it was a pretty good read, but it was missing some things.  First, I can't help feel that the author squandered an amazing opportunity because it was lacking some insight. I didn't feel like I walked away really knowing Jobs, the man. I mostly know about the events in his life, and a bunch of quotes.  But I think a lot of the quotes are publicly available anyway, and you can get a lot by watching clips on YouTube.    Second, a lot of the events that are told are a rehash of the book \\"iCon\\", which was a previous book about Jobs.  For an 'unauthorized' bio, it was good, if a little shorter.  Basically, this book tells the same sequence of events that iCon told, except that it goes beyond the publication date of iCon.  Again, testament to the fact Isaacson wasn't able to dig out much new information.    Finally, the editing wasn't great, and he wrote this book like a magazine article.  The biography is supposed to be about Jobs, but there are many places where the story suddenly breaks and Isaacson starts saying \\"me\\", which puts him in the center of the story.  E.g., \\"Jobs told ME\\", or, \\"I thought\\".  Moreover, there are places where Isaacson adds commentary that shouldn't be there.  E.g., Jobs did X, but \\"that was a bad move.\\"  The commentary is not insightful, and it's slightly biased.  And I certainly don't care for Isaacson being in the center by using the first person - the book is about Jobs, and the author should remain hidden from view.    All in all, this is a great read for someone who wants to know about Jobs's life, so I recommend it for that purpose - but you won't walk away with any deeper insight than if you read a Wiki synposis of his life and watch a few YouTube videos.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I was recently recommended Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult and thoroughly enjoyed reading the book.  Unlike most reviewers I liked the way the book switched from the past to the present as it was something new and the book was very fast paced and interesting.  After reading such a great book I decided to look for another book by Miss Picoult and decided upon The Pact which was one of her more highly rated books.<br /><br />Now the reason I've given this book three stars is because on its own as a stand alone read I'm sure it would be great - it would almost be as good as Nineteen Minutes but not quite.  However after reading it so soon after her previous novel I was shocked by how many similarities there were.  The long drawn out court and prison scenes started to annoy me due to them being so similar to the last book I'd read and the past/present style whilst novel in the first book was samey in this one.  In fact aside from the social issues in the two books being different they could have quite easily been the same book.<br /><br />I'm on the fence here as whilst Jodi Picoult had a great premise this book just didn't do it for me.  There were a lot of unanswered questions and the books I have read of hers are too samey to be enjoyable.  I would definitely read another of her books again but I think I will leave it for a year or so.  As stand alone books they are great, but I really recommend that you don't read two or more in a row.
0875428940|5.0|The art on the deck is awesome it is personal and you can tell.  The author of the cards and the book did a very good job and I commend her.  I like the vibrant full colors used and the actual faces of the cards.  I really think if you like tarot cards you will probably love these.
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books I've ever read. The plot is intriguing yet disturbing, the book is action-packed and has perfect pacing. You get a pretty good sense of the life of central character Katniss Everdeen and the futuristic world that she lives in, especially how sadistic and oppressive the government is. The brutal violence depicted in the book might turn some people off, but for those that don't mind such things, The Hunger Games will give you a lot of food for thought.

B0057OOPXM|5.0|A few months ago I saw John Mayall perform at a small club in Victoria, B.C. It was a great show; the man is 78 years old and he can still outperform musicians less than a third of his age.<br /><br />During the show, Mayall played some of his 1960s material that I haven't listened to for years. It's great stuff so, since seeing that Mayall concert, I've been revisiting and rediscovering many of these classic 1960s British blues albums.<br /><br />It's easy to forget what a masterful player John Mayall was, and still is. This 1966 album with Eric Clapton on lead guitar - often called the Beano album because Clapton is reading a copy of Beano magazine in the cover photo - is a groundbreaking and very influential album in blues history. Among other things, it was the first recording of Eric Clapton doing an all blues album. Clapton had recorded previously with The Yardbirds but The Yardbirds, while certainly influenced by the blues, weren't strictly a blues band; John Mayall's band was, without doubt, a blues band.<br /><br />Shortly after this album was released, Eric Clapton left John Mayall's band to form Cream with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.<br /><br />Apart from Clapton's guitar playing, this was the first album to feature a track with Eric Clapton doing lead vocals.<br /><br />It's worthwhile to give John Mayall's 1960s albums a listen or a re-listen. For those of you who haven't heard Mayall's 1960s material, you should check it out. This album and Mayall's 1967 \\"Hard Road\\" album with Peter Green on guitar are, in my opinion, the best of John  Mayall's 1960s albums. I would go as far as to say they are both essential recordings for any blues fan. Both are certainly worth a listen. This is a very influential album in blues history.<br /><br />This is the basic album without extra tracks. There are other CD versions with added extra tracks that weren't on the original vinyl LP.
B00452J5IW|4.0|This was a special album to me when it came out; two things I loved were Sci-Fi & R&R. I hadn't heard it for (quite literally) decades. That being the case, I can't really judge the re-mastering other than to say it sounds great to me. Seems much clearer than I remember, but as I was usually \\"indulging\\" when listening to music back then, my memory might not be entirely accurate.   In short, if you liked this album back in the day, you won't be disappointed by this package. It sounds good, it looks good, & it has some entertaining and mildly informative liner notes.The bonus material is pretty standard alternate takes/live stuff; nothing special but not a total waste of time.  That said, \\"Blows Against The Empire\\" is very much a relic of it's time & to some ears might sound dated and/or silly and/or pretentious. While I really love this album, I couldn't honestly say there's no validity to any of the above criticisms. If nothing else, tho, it's a unique little piece of rock history, a one-of-a-kind document of the end of an era, sort of a last gasp of the 60's.

I can use my own imagination in deciding what to do with these motifs, but I needed a little bit of technical assistance in making them, and in seeing the variations that can be done.

Clapton had recorded previously with The Yardbirds but The Yardbirds, while certainly influenced by the blues, weren't strictly a blues band; John Mayall's band was, without doubt, a blues band.<br /><br />Shortly after this album was released, Eric Clapton left John Mayall's band to form Cream with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.<br /><br />Apart from Clapton's guitar playing, this was the first album to feature a track with Eric Clapton doing lead vocals.<br /><br />It's worthwhile to give John Mayall's 1960s albums a listen or a re-listen. For those of you who haven't heard Mayall's 1960s material, you should check it out. This album and Mayall's 1967 \\"Hard Road\\" album with Peter Green on guitar are, in my opinion, the best of John  Mayall's 1960s albums. I would go as far as to say they are both essential recordings for any blues fan. Both are certainly worth a listen. This is a very influential album in blues history.<br /><br />This version has some extra tracks that weren't on the original vinyl LP.
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Bought this together with the Fire and when I received it was a bit disappointing. The quality of the product was average and the look and feel of it was a bit cheap. The strap on the back was glued on very cheaply and is already starting to come apart. It is not worth the price I paid for, try other brands.
0312360258|4.0|*KINDLE edition*<br /><br />Real-life teenagers know about BJs and pierced body parts. They say f#&k and s(@t. Girls talk to their friends about what they're going through. That's what the teenagers in this book do, and some reviewers (mostly trolls) don't like it.<br /><br />And that's a good thing! If they don't like books like this, they shouldn't read it.<br /><br />The book is too new-age for me in some ways, but the vampyres are sometimes MESSY. They die in spectacular, bloody fashion... as failed vampyres WOULD, and as we sometimes do in real life. People make mistakes, both minor and major. They suffer for them to an appropriate degree, then pick themselves up and have another go. Life is like that.<br /><br />Zoey may be a cliche teenager in many ways; whatever. But she's also brave. She fights for what's right, and she doesn't swoon at every sight of blood or sex or adversity. She's in this for real, and she knows it.<br /><br />Disregard the trolls unless you're just like them. It's not a GREAT book, but it's a good one. I'll read the next in the series.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this novel!!!! If you love dogs at all you will love this book!! A good book for anyone to read. I have recommended this book to my friends,my family, my boss and even my husband!!! This book made me joyful, angry , and so emotional that I had to put it down a few times to collect myself. When at the book store I always seemed to pass this book up , but then after 2 random people (on different occasions)  came and handed me the book both telling me \\"read this you will love it!) I finally purchased the book. Now I have to say that I am the random person in the book store that tells people to read \\" The Art of Racing in the Rain.\\"  This is an amazing book that you will love and always remember !!!
B005N1E8A4|4.0|ALERT!  While this 2-disc set DOES offer Kylie's concert in Blu-Ray 3D, the discs themselves are mislabeled.  Although everything indicates that Disc 1 contains 3D playback (right down to the Blu-Ray 3D logo), it's actually Disc 2 that contains the 3D concert.  Boy, was I surprised by this mistake.  The 3D (once you get the right disc in your player) is surprisingly effective.  You wouldn't think that a concert would lend itself to 3D, but thanks to the stage design and the use of dancers, there's a nice level of depth throughout.  And (of course) Kylie herself is great.

0525423281|3.0|The thing about Lola and the boy next door is that, since it's a companion book, it's inevitable to make a comparison with [[ASIN:0142419400 Anna and the French Kiss]] which, in this case, comes out as a disadvantage because, as far as I am concerned, Anna is the absolute winner.<br /><br />Lola is a really cute story: she is a quirky, raised by gay parents, unique teenage girl.<br />When her first crush and ex-neighbor, Cricket, reappears on her doorstep after two years, things get complicated because Lola already has a boyfriend, Max, five years older than her, much more experienced.<br />As Cricket slowly worms his was back into her life - and into her heart - Lola will have to learn how to be honest with herself - and she will learn it the hard way.<br /><br />I'll admit I had high expectations for this book and while it's certainly enjoyable and relaxing, it failed to deliver repeatedly for me.<br />Whereas Anna's story, while still being fluffy, was more believable, less shallow and more charming, Lola's story was definitely more clich&eacute;d, more puerile and felt forced in more than one occasion.<br /><br />The most striking example of this \\"forcedness\\" is Max.<br />I didn't like how he first gets presented as an awesome boyfriend and then, quite conveniently, ends up being the bad guy in a total unreasonable way. It was done unreasonably and felt so contrived, that when he does become \\"bad\\" and I was supposed to despise him I just couldn't bring myself to and I still liked him from before!<br /><br />I wonder if it all has to do with the fact that the 5 years of difference in age between Lola and Max are taken as a big NO NO right from the start, because frankly, I didn't buy it. I had a 22 years old boyfriend when I was 17 and it was NOT a big deal. But, since it's taken for granted here that Max is too old for Lola, let's just make him the EVIL guy. The way the author deals with his character royally bugged me. It wasn't smooth AT ALL.<br />But the same goes for the other characters: basically, they were just too black or white, they lacked depth and originality: Cricket was just too damn good for his own sake, Max too damn bad (kind of in a beautiful and damned way), Lola too damn in self denial: what she says to Max when she goes to his apartment? So not cool, girl. My eye was twitching madly during that passage.<br /><br />Still, it's a book I'd recommend if you're looking for something quite readable and relaxing AND you loved Anna. Perkins certainly knows how to write a story and make her dialogues interesting. It's a colorful book, as colorful as its cover, despite the psycho-looking girl there.<br />I just wish there had been a little more to it, a bit more substance. Anna was definitely more fun for me.k or white, they lacked depth and originality: Cricket was just too damn good for his own sake, Max too damn bad (kind of in a beautiful and damned way), Lola too damn in self denial: what she says to Max when she goes to his apartment?

098357670X|5.0|Tom Richmond's book is a must-have for anyone aspiring to draw recognizable caricatures, whether in a live situation or in a studio from photos. It illustrates a multitude of concepts both visually and verbally, with example after example of almost every facial minutiae there is! As a fifteen-year veteran of live caricature work, I learned both new ideas (constant lines of force) from this book, and also found things I knew (such as sequencing) explained more articulately and in-depth than anywhere else.  The in-your-face illustrations are both amusing and educational when aligned with the text. Newbie mistakes to avoid are also mentioned.  This book will pay for itself if making money is your goal...if it isn't, your result will be the pleasure of creating a well-crafted caricature.

0743297334|5.0|Full disclosure: I love Ernest Hemingway! I don't know why. My Late mother didn't care for him. She enjoyed F. Scot Fitzgerald. I don't so much. Both men wrote sparingly under Gertrude Stein's tutelage. Both men were part of the same expatriate crowd living in Paris after the conclusion of WW I. Hemingway and Fitzgerald both lived \\"the lost generation\\" lifestyle. Fitzgerald drowned in it; Hemingway left and grew as an important literary author until he could no longer write shortly before his suicide in 1961. He became as impotent as Jake Barnes suffering from not a physical malady but that of mental illness, probably Manic Depression Disorder. But his genius started with this book that was published in 1926.<br /><br /> The dialogue is strong and compelling as he digs into the moral morasses of excessiveness of that shallow, drunken, and selfish crowd Hemingway belonged to. Jake's pain pierces our heart as he narrates the story. He is poetic. \\"Brett was damned good-looking. She wore a slipover jersey sweater and a tweed skirt, and her hair was brushed back like a boy's. She started that.\\"  He can never make her happy as a man should, because a war injury left him physically unable. We flinch with him as Lady Brett flaunts both her fianc&eacute; and her affair with the beautiful matador in Spain. Both Jake and Cohn (the Jewish Boxer) can only watch her destruction through a drunken haze. They are powerless in their love for Lady Brett Ashley.<br /><br /> But Brett is powerless in her love for Jake. She loves him wholly, but needs what Jake can't give her. They dance the bull fight; she is the matador luring Jake by wearing his love down and pierces his heart time after time.  It is the price Jake and Brett must pay for wanting what can never be. They will always dance the matador's dance of death. Though they are truly in love, the pair can't help hurting one another. So, they drink and drink some more. And this tragic dance is beautiful in Hemingway's great novel.
B004EPZ06Q|1.0|This whole UltraViolet stuff is thanks to the special deals between Netflix and WB. What good is a copy you have to upload and use Flixter? The old way was easy and actaully useful especially for those who travel a lot.  You no longer own the UltraViolet content maybe it's just me but I don't like packing the original disc on a trip. I am hoping customer demand and pressure will change this back. from what I see with upcoming releases it does not look good.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I found the book after an hour in the library. I've read only book two and yet the way he describes his pain and feeling is actually more interesting than the main plot. I recommend this of course. I hope in years to come James will become big.

0060987464|5.0|I saw a lot of reviews saying things like he sounded pretentious and name dropped the heck out of rock stars and drugs. Well, he did, and I mean a lot. But this is Marilyn Manson after all... he's a shock rocker in the main stream and I bet a lot of people who picked up this book did so BECAUSE they wanted to read about things like that. It isnt overwhelming and as for his being pretentious and all... AGAIN! It's Marilyn Manson. He has a right to be a little full of himself. He's PROUD of what he's done. In reality you have a book filled with stories, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else. This isnt a book about a crazy drugged out rocker or the lonely kid with a messed up childhood that grew up to be a star or the sex addict who screwed a ton of celebrities or the satanic priest who has done some REALLY messed up things... its all that in one...AND THEN SOME! Towards the end I started to feel really bad for the guy but then he comes back and really drives in the point that he can come through literally anything and get what he wants out of life. It's actually pretty inspirational. Regardless of whether you agree with the things Manson stands for or not, I think everyone can get something out of this book. I know I personally couldnt put it down.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was a great way to escape the real world and drown in the drama and romance of college life mixed with underground fighting. It shows that once you find the one, there is no going back and nothing else feels right. It is incredible and so hard to stop reading. I'm glad I came across this book because it brought many happy moments to my day.
0385344325|3.0|The story makes you want to keep reading until the end. The super skilled fighter is again entertaining to follow. However, the unnecessary sexual content is something that makes it so I can't recommend it to students in the high school, unlike some of the other Reacher novels.
B006FE17Q6|5.0|While the first season of The Walking Dead contained more action that's typical for the zombie genre, season 2 has been a more subtle exploration of emotion, humanity and morality.  Even if you have thought this season is a little too slow for your taste, your drudgery is not in vain.  Keep watching because the juice is worth the squeeze with this episode!  I have rarely experienced a show or movie or book that has magnified and manipulated that incredibly thin line between right and wrong like I've experienced with this season.  Each episode has been a gradual build up of pressure that's been so subtle, that you are just not ready for the explosion of this episode.  It hits you like a torrent of love, hate, fear, dread, hope, sadness and disgust.  I found myself stuck in the rifts of the character's fractured relationships, siding with one person in one minute then completely changing my mind the very next.  I am almost angry that the writers were able to manipulate me this much and shock me with plot twists that were right in my face that I just didn't see coming.  They way they pulled together the plot lines with such cohesiveness was amazing and satisfying, but also left it in such a way where I wish I had a time machine so I wouldn't have to wait until next week to see where in the hell they're going to take the story.    In summary: freaking epic.
