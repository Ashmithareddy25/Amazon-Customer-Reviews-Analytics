1570629706|4.0|This book starts out great but runs out of steam about 2/3rds through.  If it had been the other way around I probably would be giving it 5 stars, but as it was it left me flat at the end.<br /><br />Siddhartha explors the ancient Indian religions as he make he way through life, and the insights that Hesse brings alive are masterful and deep.  The spirituality is wonderful, with the fiction backdrop to bring it to life.<br /><br />This book is a classic, and an easy and short read, recommended for everyone.<br /><br />Entertainment: 3 stars<br />Enlightenment: 5 stars<br />Overall: 4 stars
B00000J7J4|5.0|music - loved supernatural..this was a replacement cd since my husband played mine so much he ruined the first one!!
B000URDEB0|3.0|Even though it has the word Nightwish on the cover and on the CD, this is EPICA's music.    There is hardly any difference b/t this Nightwish CD and \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" CD from EPICA.  They sound the same.    Sad to see Tarja leave the band.  Yeah, they got a good replacement, but to be honest, it sounds more like EPICA than it does Nightwish.    I would recommend to look into EPICA CDs if you want to find a songs that sound similar to this.  \\"The Phantom Agony\\" CD, \\"Consign to Oblivion\\" CD, and their new one \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" CD.    \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is not Nightwish.  This is EPICA.    So, don't expect to see anything new or different on here that is not on any other EPICA CD.  Other than that, it is a very good CD, and it is definitely worth listening to, if you like EPICA's music that is.

B00026WU7I|5.0|I don't mention this album a lot, possibly because it's always so praised by everyone.  But it is one of rock's greatest albums, and one of Dylan's very best.  It came at a time when many in the rock world were writing him off, after years of mediocre, subpar work (culminating in the atrocious Planet Waves).  Not only does Dylan make a great album, but he makes a rich, profound masterpiece.  There isn't one wasted song on the entire thing.  Every song is perfect.  It's really a smorgasboard of riches.  Tangled Up in Blue starts the album off perfectly, and every subsequent song lives up and surpasses it.  Simple Twist of Fate and Idiot Wind are ones I can listen to over and over again, but my favorite here has to be Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts.  It's a great Dylan epic, wonderfully told, as rich in narrative as a Faulkner or a Tolstoy novel, and the arrangement of it is superlative.  It's interesting to contrast You're a Big Girl Now (and Idiot Wind) with their more contemplative takes on the Biograph album and the Bootleg Series, Vol. 2 album, respectively.  I prefer the raw, angrier version of Idiot Wind, but there are times I really prefer the quieter, sadder version of You're a Big Girl Now.  Dylan enjoyed a creative renaissance for the rest of the decade, only to drift in the 1980's and the early part of the 1990's, until he found it again (and so far, he still has it going).  Yes, this album is as great as everyone has said, and it will always be remembered as Dylan's best from the 1970's.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|While I don't find this an engaging as some of David Attenborough's other work (possibly due to the lack of him being in front of the camera while hanging from limbs of a tree), the visuals here are simply stunning. It's the first DVD I've seen that actually made me want to buy an HD-DVD player and HD-TV. The visuals are so crisp and full of color that I don't think it is as fully experienced on a regular DVD as it could be in high def.    That said, this looks amazing and (once again) the BBC have filmed locales and animals for the first time. Rarely will you see something you know through and through . . . unless you live, literally, in the desert or in a caves. Even then, the cameramen (and women) find ways to get to places rarely seen by the human eye.    As usual, David Attenborough and the BBC have put together a package that is not only visually stunning, but fosters a new look on the lives we live and our place in this beautiful chaos. This is something that documentaries rarely do and I put most of Attenborough's work on the level of Carl Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" and Planet Earth is not an exception. For a documentary, this is top notch.
1559409010|5.0|This is Python's most unique film, in that it was enormously controversial when it was released, something most people don't know about.  It was originally to be funded by EMI, but then some pressure groups got to EMI, so they cancelled it.  Luckily, George Harrison's Handmade Films came in and rescued the production.  When it hit here, Catholic groups were up in arms over the film, and they even tried to prosecute on the grounds of \\"blasphemy\\".  Even the right wing icon William F. Buckley, Jr. (who, despite being a right winger, actually is very articulate and has a small sense of art) got into the fray, wrote an article in the New York Post condemning the film and saying that Monty Python was crucified in the final scene.  Monty Python is not a real person as most people know.  It's more than likely the wanker Buckley didn't see the film.  The BBFC, the censor board in the U.K., was under pressure from religious groups and gave it a 18 rating, limiting its audience to adults.<br /><br />As for the film itself, it's hilarious, and it lampoons the rather idiotic notions of religion and politics.  There's even a scene where they lampoon the PC left (the term PC hadn't been invented yet) where Idle constantly interrupts his group by insisting that the word woman be added to every sentence that Cleese puts out.  But it's mostly fundie religious types that get lampooned here, along with most sections of humanity.  There are many hilarious scenes, like the stoning scene, the \\"blessed are the cheesemakers\\" sermon on the mount scene, and, of course, the final scene where the crucified people are all singing \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\".  This is a fabulous film, one of the Python's most memorable and deeply satiric films.

B0007Y08IS|1.0|I am not much of a fan of South Park (though I liked the film), but I decided to watch this anyway, and it's a really creepy, bad movie.  I really don't know why they decided to use hand puppets for the characters.  Their faces are expressionless for the most part, and it gives off a really creepy vibe, which I don't think was the intention.  The film is a bit dated already, as many targets of its satire are not newsmakers anymore.  Many in the future will watch this film in utter bewilderment, as they will not have the context to understand it, because all of its satire is topical.  Of course, there are gross out jokes (it wouldn't be a Trey and Matt if there wasn't).  I did like some of the satire.  There's a very funny moment at a meeting of \\"FAG\\" (really childish name) where the Janeane Garofalo hand puppet says \\"we should be allowed to read news headlines and pretend they're our own words\\".  Janeane recently appeared on Bill Maher's show, and she said \\"Bush is the new Saddam\\".  This was an actual headline from a Canadian newspaper recently, so I thought the sequence was rather amusing.  In fairness to Janeane, she doesn't do this all the time, but it's still worth noting.  But too often these incisive satiric moments like that are few and far between, and the film relies on gross out humour, bad jokes, monotonic dialogue, and just lazy writing.  The South Park movie was funnier and more interesting.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|The first review I read about this CD was It's NOT the \\"The Rising\\", well it's not supposed to be. The music presented here by the Boss & Crew is new & a well crafted, great CD. Most bands create music first & lyrics to fit, but Bruce writes great lyrics & then surrounds them with first rate music by the worlds most gifted musicians. This CD stands on its own merit as another masterpiece of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band. Listeners need to absorb it for what it is, not compare it to anything else the band has recorded.
B000CDIOYO|5.0|Being by far no erudite (Electrical Engineer for that matter), my approach to listnening seeks the raw emotional connection whith music, afraid what mandatory distance is required for a more rational critique may deprive me of it.  That said, I was presented last year with an excellent compendium for the Matthaus Passion by a slightly different cast, which can also be found here [[ASIN:B00004Z1BP Bach J.S: Matthaus Passion]]. Being now more familiar with major chorals and arias, the experience of not only listening, but suddenly watching faces - only guessed at before - for voices or players, was simply overwhelming. Video added a new blow over an already sensitive substrate, letting me drained and numb.  It may be argued from a more musicaly informed point of view, whether this is the best rendering for the masterwork, whether Richter's approach brings to the forefront the true composer's inspiration, whether the selected cast was the best and so forth.  One may at least rest assured this version's performers meet required credentials, consequently making this - ultimate or not - a first rate work. Add to this the impeccable misse en scene in the form of a gentle hill, an impossing cross governing the skies, carefully managed lighting, framing, and intimate rendition for the most soul-wrenching arias, for a truly unique visual and listening experience.  ....  8 years later, having played this set many many times, and having searched about Richter, Schreier and all other soloists, as well as various reviews and discussions from different sources, some reflections come to mind.  That we are sharing just an instant in time for example. Richter died in 1981, Schram (bartone playing Jesus) left in 2004 and Berry (bass, the great protagonist of the trailing parts) died in 2000. Helen Donath (soprano) is 74, while alto Julia Hamari, responsible for arguably the most touching arias like Peter's lament is currently 72.  I met Richter and Bach's organ works in the early 70'sand adopted his tempo and vision as a personal reference. His version of the less known Prelude and Fugue BWV 532 (as compared with the tocatta and fugue BWV 565) runs an accelerated tempo which changes in my humble view what could be an unremarkable piece into an explosion of power and discourse.  Richter view was not allways shared and it is said he died an embittered man in an hotel only 56 years old, but I prefer to believe he was well aware of a deserved recognition. This particular rendition of Bach's monumental St Peter Passion will allways be a reference to gauge other efforts, no matter whether a more cannonical approach may better suit purist's tastes. I believe at this level of artistic competence  there are no wrong approaches, but different views which can only enrichen.

B000053VAF|5.0|There are very few films were one can compliment both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in their acting efforts.  Besides \\"Good Will Hunting\\", this is another one of those efforts.  Cast of the movie is fantastic.  Alan Rickman is great in his role as voice of God and it is delightfull surprise to learn that the God is in form of beautiful and serene Alanis Morisette.  Chris Rock will not fail you as one of the \\"forgotten\\" apostole (13th one that happens to be black).  Unless you are an individual  too serious about your Catholic faith, or just too God fearing Christian in general, you will find this movie to be smart, funny and very entertaining.  I will be the first one to admit that I did not expect much of this movie and I got a very nice treat.  This is one of the comedies that you will always think of fondly  - if you are humble enough to laugh at yourself.  I believe that every one of us can see themselves or someone close we know in this colorful display of characters.

B00003CXCW|5.0|Sunset Boulevard is a classic but you truly have to see for yourself why it is. Gloria Swanson was at her finest and William Holden is one extraordinary and handsome actor. Holden is such an under-rated talent, every movie and role he played was great, he really gives it his all, even in that I Love Lucy episode. Swanson was a popular silent film actress in her day and there is irony in this film since her character was also in the prime of her life as a silent star. This is one film you have to see to believe, this film borders on campy but it's genius filmmaking, plain and simple. Get this today!
B000URDEB0|1.0|Nightwish officialy has turned into a pop band. The old nightwish played great symphonic metal, but this is...so normal...mediocre...so mainstream. All I got to say is...What the hell happened?? Where has the magic gone? Couple songs are OK, but overall...it's lacking and dissapointing. Lacking that nightwish flow and atmosphere. NW has lost all its power and melodics. I can't believe all the 5 star ratings. And annete's voice? Well what about it?...for nightwish it just doesn't seem quite right. It's so...normal. Sounds like so many other voices out there.    Music wise, just seems overdone at times. Go to a nightwish show now and you'll be hearing mostly a backing track as opposed to actual Nightwish. To much layering, and backing vocals for the likes of me. In the Old days, nightwish used to play with a lot of power and had a great sound just from the keyboards, guitar, bass, drums and vocals that was unique to them. It was refreshing. Take that away now...and there isn't much there musically. The've lost that pure, melodic, magical sound. They sound soo mainstream now I can't believe it.    This album may just be the final nail in the coffin for us Metal Fans who were hoping for another great Symphonic metal master piece by Nightwish. May be more appealing to people who prefer mainstream music. But It's time to face the cold reality. Those days where NW was the best symphonic METAL, yea I mean METAL band around may be long gone. Seems they have gone more mainstream to attract more people. They will loose a lot of metal fans though as they are straddling the lines between metal and pop rock. I'm no \\"nice weather fan,\\" I call it like I see it.     For those of you new to nightwish, stay away from this one. I'd recommend century child, wishmaster and oceanbourne they are ALL a million times better. If you heard of Nightwish's great symphonic metal. You got to go with those 3 they are true masterpieces that I will always play. DPP is not representive of nightwish'sbest. If anything it's nightwish's worst. Sorry.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Outstanding! Story often takes a hit when special effects are involved. This is not the case with Serenity. This is a well structured story with likable characters. While it does not break any ground in the world of literature, the story is not just another retread of old scripts.     I have watched this movie five times already. Then I went back and watched the TV series on DVD. Like the original Star Trek, there is a chemistry with the performers that keeps the viewer engaged. I am looking forward to the next release at the movie theater so that I can live vicariously through these characters again.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|\\"It lies to her. It tells her things only a child can understand. It's been using her to restrain the others. To her, it simply is another child. To us, it is The Beast\\" - Tangina Barons informs The Freeling family that something more ominous & dark than the Dish Network is holding their daughter, Carol-Anne, captive in \\"Poltergeist\\"<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see an HD presentation of the new DVD transfer, via satelite, of \\"Poltergeist\\" last night (10/4) at my local theater. It was a bit of a dissapointment.<br /><br />First, the film's original aspect ratio (2.20:1) was made to fit the theater screen (1.85:1), so there was some croppin' going on (it was only noticable in a couple of scenes, but it stil sucks). Second, the film was only presented in stereo and not in surround (this sucked real bad, because I have the original DVD release in 5.1 Dolby & it sounds awesome).<br /><br />As I sat & watched the film, one thing is very noticable & thats the films age. \\"Poltergeist\\" needs some film restoration pronto. From what I saw there seem to be a noticable amount of color fade throughout the film. So much so, that when I got home I popped my DVD copy into my player just to double check. This also could be chalked up to the way the film was being broadcast.<br /><br />The new featurette was also shown after the film & that came in crystal clear. This includes scenes from \\"Poltergeist\\" that were used throughout. The featurette is pretty lame & if you watch \\"Ghost Hunters\\" or \\"Ghostbusters\\", for that matter, you already know the basics.<br /><br />The major problem with \\"Poltergeist\\" is that the rights are owned by Warner Brothers & not MGM who released the film in June 1982. That said, I can only assume that any & all special features, deleted scenes, etc. are owned & forgotten somewhere in the MGM film vaults. As for the cast, my guess is either they weren't contacted to contribute for this release or they declined because they were busy with other obligations or declined out of respect for Dominque Dunne (she was strangled to death by her boyfriend on 11/4/82) & Heather O Rourke.<br /><br />As for this 25th anniversary release, if you already have the first release, stick to it. Because, even though you can't raise the dead, you can prevent yourself from burning a financial hole in your pocket.que Dunne (she was strangled to death by her boyfriend on 11/4/82) & Heather O Rourke.

0670034711|3.0|My impression of her interview on Oprah leaves me with a clear impression that the author is talking from the kind of 'knowing' that comes from honestly having asked herself key questions and then having opened herself up for some answers. A lot can be faked, but the key quality I saw in her was \\"authenticity\\", which is difficult to make up. If you can see/hear authenticity, you know when it's not there.  I have not read any of the book, yet, but I can tell you that I'm much more likely to read it, having seen the interview, than I am to avoid it due to the nay-sayers here who don't back up their comments with any experience of their own.  I'm ordering a couple of copies and will pass them along to people I care about, I predict.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|[[ASIN:B000V8I2QU Magic]] There is ONE WORD for this New Album... INCREDIBLE     All the songs are incredibly good. All of them.   There are some others that stand out for me, more than the others.   One in particular is \\"LONG WALK HOME\\"  There is one problem with this song........And that is that it actually ends.    This is a song that I hate to have end. So of course I have to repeat it over and over and over and over etc. It's a long song as well. It's that good. One can only smile when Clarence kicks in with his SAX.       PLUS, the more you play it the better it gets. It can't get much better than that.  The other problem is that if you have other music that you would like to listen to, you may have trouble actually pressing the eject button.  As I seid, you don't want this one to end.  To Bruce and the E-Street Band.  A \\"Masterpiece\\"      And to Bruce Srpingsteen, if you are reading this,    I (Bald Headed Guy with Glasses) used to work in a Bookstore in Eatontown NJ that you would occasionally visit, but I never approached you to mention the greatness of \\"The Rising\\".....Choosing to give you your privacy.

The story he tells of the trainride to Italy while making Quinoa  is worth the price by itself. When you stand back he is a great storyteller with a distilled countrysimple slant.The new movie does jump around a bit but it is linear and Metaphysically wellpaced and he does have a few messages that are clear to people who can see.I just love him. Time is going so fast I dont even know if we have time for future generations to understand the beautiful work we have before us today. Dave call me I want to be in your next movie.Life can be so simple if you just let it. There are so many beautiful things right in front of you,just forget the me and look.Im so glad he enjoyed working in Europe, we must look like bumpkins to the world at times but there are some who are capable of great thought.Heres to your next project,glueguns paint and sweat.Cheers!!!
B000056VJ7|5.0|Ahhh....Meatloaf, people either love him or hate him.  Bat Out Of Hell was one of the biggest selling albums of the 70's.  For some it was the ultimate over the top bombastic monster of an album, for others it was a prime example of overbearing pomp rock crap.  Personally, I have always loved this album.  Meatloaf had a unique and powerful voice and he was one hell of a stage performer.   I played this thing to death when I owned it on vinyl and finally replaced my old record with this compact disc.  The album boasts and all star cast with all of the songs written by Jim Steinman, and the album produced by Todd Rundgren.  Several huge hit singles came from the disc including the title track, Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad, You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth and the classic teenage lust anthem Paradise By The Dashboard Light.  All Revved Up With No Place To Go also received some AOR airplay.  The rest of the album is fleshed out with two bombastic power ballads Heaven Can Wait and the big finale For Crying Out Loud.  I know people who absolutely hate this album and I can understand why, but it clicked with me right from the beginning and I have always enjoyed it.   Yes it is almost Andrew Lloyed Webber-ish in its scope and every thing Meat does is over the top, but Bat remains a unique and powerful album that in my opinion deserves the big sales that it achieved.

0765316978|4.0|The Last Colony is the third book in the series. If you haven't read the other two, Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, then I urge you to get your hands on them and read them. The Ghost Brigades was probably my favorite of the series, but really, all of the books, including the novelette, The Sagan Diaries, are good and contribute to the overall story arc.<br /><br />As of this moment, I think this may be the weakest book of the three, but don't take that as a criticism. I often find it takes me a little while after reading a story to fully appreciate it. By writing this review right away I'm being unfair. I haven't had time to appreciate the subtleties.<br /><br />I'm amazed by how well Scalzi was able to surprise me with the story. Yet, he somehow, comfortingly, allowed me to predict a few things. I like that combination.<br /><br />The story progressed at a good pace, constantly keeping me entertained, unlike Excession, where I felt bogged down for days and weeks suffering through what seemed like mindless background to get to the good stuff. In the end Excession paid off, but I didn't have to wait until the ending twist for The Last Colony to pay off.<br /><br />*** Spoilers Below ***<br /><br />Even though I feel all glowy about the book, I do have a few complaints. I didn't feel much for the new characters. When Hiram Yoder is killed it should be a poignant scene, but it isn't. Yes, I feel a loss of someone important to the colony, but not to the story. Even Savitri, who is an interesting character to be sure, lacks the depth that gives me any feeling for her. Hickory and Dickory are the only new characters that I really felt a sense of attachment.<br /><br />I felt much more for the characters introduced in the other two novels: John, Jane, Jared, Harry, even Szilard and Boutin.<br /><br />I'm also a little disappointed that the werewolves disappeared after a critical scene. What happened between them and the colony? Was it possible to negotiate? I know it would have needlessly extended the book to go into those details, but I still wonder.<br /><br />Overall though, it's an excellent end to the series. Scalzi wrapped up the plot and the series in a happy ending without making it sappy or unbelievable. In the afterward he said he wouldn't be coming back to these characters. Although I'll miss them, I'm glad. As I get older my patience for long series grows short. Even though each book he's written so far can stand alone, I don't think I could stand another 10 year series.<br /><br />He hasn't left out the possibility of returning to the world again one day and I look forward to new stories from this world.those details, but I still wonder.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|A must see movie for any blues guitar fan. Music from Stevie Vai and Ry Cooder with Robert Johnson tunes scattered throughout. A young blues/classical guitar student tracks an retired blues harmonica player to a medical prison in a search for Robert Johnsons 'lost song', then breaks him out and the adventure begins. The film climaxes in a cameo by Stevie Vai 'cuttin' heads' for the soul of the harmonica player. Has had a bit of a cult following since its release.
0060558121|4.0|I liked this book. Gaiman has a way of making the unusual seem usual. It bothered me a bit because I know people who believe in gods exactly as Gaiman describes them. And after reading the book I'm guessing a lot of that came from Gaiman. I've spent much of my time rejecting the notion of the supernatural lately and so even though the book is written as fiction, it still bothered me a bit. But I was able to overlook that dissatisfaction enough to enjoy the book.<br /><br />The book centers on Shadow, a man who's life is changed when he is released from prison early after his wife is killed in an accident. As he's dealing with his grief, a man offers him a job. Shadow doesn't want to do anything more than put his wife to rest, but instead he's caught up in a story and a world that he never imagined existed.<br /><br />Parts of the book are just fantastic. The description and the characters in Lakeside, a town Shadow hides out in later in the book, made this book for me. I could see Lakeside in my mind and it was a place that I wanted to visit. It was that perfect small-town where things really aren't perfect, but it's still beautiful and moving, even in the midst of tragedy. If I could imagine a perfect place to live (minus the murders), it would be there.<br /><br />I also loved the bit with Anubis, Bast, and (I'm drawing a blank on the other god, Osiris?) in Memphis, Michigan (I think?) running the funeral parlor.<br /><br />Overall the story was great. It took me a little bit longer to get into, but under normal circumstances I don't think it would have been as difficult. And once it captured me towards the last 100-150 pages I couldn't put it down.

B000V8I2QU|2.0|This is a major bump in the road.  Only 4 songs are up to Springsteen standards [this is the stuff you would expect from Seger or Mellencamp] and the production sound is simply the worst I have ever heard on a major record by a major artist on a major label. Every song is mushy and muffled to the extent that it is just one big pile of noise.  Even if the songs were great it wouldn't matter, just listening to this thing is like fingernails on a chalkbord.  Outside of \\"Radio Nowhere\\" \\"Magic\\" \\"Livin'In The Future\\" and \\"Long Walk Home\\" there is not one song on this mess that I would want or have any desire to see played live--unless I needed to use the restroom.  I have been a huge Bruce fan since 1978 and it really pains me to see this happen.  Very, very sad indeed.
0740748475|5.0|[[ASIN:0740748475 The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (Calvin & Hobbes)]]<br />Love the collection. The only real problem is the size of the books can make them unwieldy to hold when reading, however, it is well worth it!!!
0393324818|5.0|Read Michael Lewis' Moneyball before the playoffs get too far along.  As Lewis quotes someone in the book \\"Up till I was 14 years old, everything I learned about baseball came from broadcasters.  And it was all b------t!\\"  So before Joe Morgan et al start waxing eloquently about \\"manufacturing runs, etc.\\" (which means abandoning the game that got you to the playoffs), you better immunize yourself with this book.  It's simply the best baseball book ever.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|James Blunt's two albums take you into his haunting world.  A war veterans sheds his soul and tears in his words but hides them with the captivating music.  His music is from his heart and you have to listen to the words and not just the music.  He is an amazing artist and I hope that he is around for many years.  His life experience is in his art and I for one am glad that he is able to express his self and share with all of us.
0765348276|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - a very fast fun read.  The only negative I will mention is that the Heinlein influences are not -all- good.  Some of the chummy chit-chat is a bit cloying and artificial-sounding, but, also like Heinlein, it's easy to get past it to the really good stuff.  This doesn't seem to be much of an issue in the 2nd book, The Ghost Brigades, which I'm enjoying even more.
0743496728|5.0|I don't have much to say that hasn't been said in all of the other glowing reviews of this book.  Mostly what I have to say is a comment on the criticism I've frequently seen about this book, that the characters are too stereotyped.    The fact of the matter is, the sympathetic characters in this book - the ones you feel for throughout the story, and cry for at the end - are NOT the stereotypes here.  Peter is someone you can understand and relate to - you get his family dynamics, why his parents became so lost in raising him despite their best intentions, and how Peter's only mistake in growing up was always being *just a little bit* different.  He's not your stereotypical 'nerd' with tape on his glasses, getting straight A's, and a member of the chess club.  He tries to fit in at times, even participating in making fun of other uncool kids - yet at times shows wisdom beyond his years in recognizing that maybe that's not worth the price he has to pay in feeling even worse about himself.    Rather --the stereotypes in this book are the popular kids - the jocks, the pretty girls, etc.  And the fact of the matter is, these stereotypes are VERY MUCH alive and real in high schools.  The kids at schools that bully others do very little to humanize themselves to their victims, so Jodie Picoult quite brilliantly does very little to humanize them either, effectively making them much, much more accountable for their actions, and making us see them the way their victims do.  These are kids that, plain and simply, are old enough to know better.  These are kids who have parents who will turn a blind eye to the fact that their children are being cruel, and say 'kids will be kids,' while their kids' victims suffer silently and the administration turns a blind eye.  Yet when something tragic finally happens - the bullies' victim finally fights back, no matter how misguided their attempt at revenge - the parents blame everyone but themselves and their own children.  Jodie Picoulthearbreakingly shows that too many high schools' policies on bullying have not evolved along with the insanity that guns, MySpace, & IMing  have made kids capable of.  Bullying is no longer about knocking the nerd's glasses off in the hall because he raised his hand one too many times in class today, or stealing his lunch money every once in awhile - No, the stakes are now much, much higher.       I recently heard Jodie Picoult speak and was extremely impressed by her commitment to actually going out and addressing this problem - she has visited many high schools where students had read the book to discuss it with them and discuss ways to address bullying.  I really and truly believe that this book should be required reading in every highschool - the country would be a much, much better place.  Yet quite tellingly - Ms. Picoult said that her book has actually been banned in at least one high school.  When will we learn?    Out of the 6 books of hers I have read, this is by far my favorite and, if it's not already clear, has left a very lasting impression on me.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|The White Stripes are back!  With their latest effort, Icky Thump, Jack and Meg White have returned with the harder edged, garage band sound, to which their fans had grown delightfully accustomed.  Some were disappointed with 2005's Get Behind Me Satan and its largely mellow, keyboard heavy offerings, although not a bad disc by any means.  But the catchy titled Icky Thump erases any fears that the twosome were slipping into some sort of seasoned lethargy.  From sweetly melodic to loud and wonderfully grating, Icky Thump leaves the listener joyfully off balance and highly entertained throughout.  Hey...you either get this act or you don't!  The disc begins with the creatively rapping title track and then quickly segues into arguably one of their best tunes ever, the lively \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\", followed by another of the stronger cuts, \\"300 M.P. H. Torrential Outpour Blues\\".  There's a bit of a speed bump in the only Jack White non-original, \\"Conquest\\", but we're quickly back to White Stripes' reality with the hard pounding \\"Bone Broke\\".  \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\" and its companion track, \\"St. Andrew(This Battle is in The Air)\\" feature a refreshing infusion of bagpipes, adding nicely to the Stripes' trademark unpredictablilty.  Jack gets conversational in the decent \\"Little Cream Soda\\" and is then playfully joined by Meg in \\"Rag and Bone\\".  Next up is the strangely likeable, almost otherworldly \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\", then another of the better selections, \\"A Martyr For My Love For You\\".  Jack's guitar dances wildly through \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" and finally, you can just visualize Mr. White sitting contently in the corner of some modest, dimly lit venue, happily strumming away on \\"Effect And Cause\\".  All in all, a fantastic outing by the White Stripes, leaving us to ponder what this talented duo has in store the next time around!
B000UR366S|4.0|You have certain recordings in your collection you listen to over and over, but you never really tire of them. SHINE has become one such recording for me.  It may not rank up there with classics like COURT & SPARK or THE HISSING OF SUMMER LAWNS (and I certainly didn't expect it to), but SHINE is very solid. To my ears, this is Joni Mitchell's most consistently entertaining collection of songs since 1982's 'Wild Things Run Fast.'  And, despite frequent references to our wrecked planet, Joni never comes across as humorless or preachy. Thank goodness she had the good sense to end her retirement.<br /><br />DSF May 2008
B000H305U0|4.0|Great CD -  Even tho one of the tracks sounds like he is singing out of a barrel of water.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|I realize you will never personally read this.  You undoubtedly now employ a legion of sycophants to perform such tasks for you.  Not so long ago, you were without doubt the most fastidious rock 'n roll performer around.  And your millions of adoring fans loved you for it.  Whether it was a recording session, a concert, a warm up gig in Asbury Park, you were meticulous in your preparation and presentation.  Now comes Magic, your latest CD release.  My, how times have changed.<br /><br />I must say, I cannot have been listening to the same CD others have reviewed here and awarded 4 or 5 stars.  Maybe the CD I bought was defective.  But probably not, because others have noted the same deficincies I did.  Notably the sound quality. Half the songs are nearly unintelligible.  It sounds as though all instrument tracks and vocals were recorded simultaneously on a cheap cassette recorder you bought at the flea market.  What's that about?  How could you ever allow such a travesty to reach the market?  I read the lyrics in the booklet that accompanied the CD and it appeared you had lots of interesting things to say (as usual).  The problem is, there is no way I could (or anybody else could) possibly decipher your words on half the recordings.<br /><br />The sound quality on your earliest recordings was vastly superior to this latest effort.  Phil Spector had his \\"wall  of sound.\\"  I guess we can call this your \\"sinkhole of sound.\\"  I literally checked all the connections on my CD player, amp, and speakers to see why the sound was so bad.  Then Magic played, and it sounded fine.  So I guess someone intentionally produced your music in this manner.  Why?!?!?  Is this some kind of a cruel joke?  Did you aim to turn out as poor a product as possible, and see if you could still make $10 million off of it?  Is this some jab at Sony over some contractural issue?<br /><br />I realize you have had your problems in the past with the legal and business side of the music industry.  In the CD credits you list more lawyers and business people than musicians!  Is that what this is about?  Has it just become all about the Benjamins?  Well, if that's anywhere near the truth, you've lost the edge, buddy.  If that's what's going on, you need to hang it up, and pass the baton on to somebody else.<br /><br />I grew up a couple towns away from you.  We're the same age, and lived through many of the same things.  When you sang about Keasby and Highway 9, I was right there with you.  I followed your career with interest since the early '70s.  My cousin and I even met you, and had a beer with you in a little bar in Asbury Park way back when.  You have certainly earned every success you enjoy, and I wish you many more.  But don't let this latest CD be the final chapter in your storied career.  Fix this horrible recording.  Insist it be re-engineered in accordance with current state of the art standards.  Your work deserves nothing less.  Let your fans trade their current CDs for a properly recorded version of your music.  But please,..., don't allow this CD to stand as is and become part of your legacy.  Unless it has become just about the Benjamins.  That will be too bad.  And a big loss to lots of fans.  But we'll get over it.  But I don't think that's how you want to go out.<br /><br />Well, best wishes to you and yours.  Read back through some of your old lyrics and listen to some of your old recordings, and see which way you're gonna go with this.  I hope you'll do the right thing.<br /><br />--A Big Fant more lawyers and business people than musicians!  Is that what this is about?  Has it just become all about the Benjamins?

B000NVIXDW|4.0|Love this CD. Old standards, he doesn't ruin them. I bought it for \\"Everything\\" but I like the rest of them too.
B00009V7T2|3.0|First off, this band sounds nothing like Rush, or Santana, or Hendrix, or Pink Floyd, or Zeppelin, or any of the bands some people here have compared them too. I have no idea what those people are thinking. This is very tedious prog rock that at times just gets more over the top then necessary. I enjoy this CD for the simple fact that it is something different and new, and Mars Volta are of the few active prog bands around, but there are better options out there as far as prog is concerned. I find it hard to believe that anyone would consider this one of the best albums ever unless they for some reason have not been exposed to every Genesis album with Peter Gabriel, at least part of Gentle Giant's catalog, IQ's \\"Dark Matter\\", Planet P, early Marillion, Vand Der Graaf Generator, or Yes. This band is more in line with King Crimson, who are also an overated band. Too much jazz/fusion/chaos that has a tendency to ruin some of the songs. Yes, this is a good record, but c'mon...all the bands I mentioned above are far better and to say that The Mars Volta are one of the best bands ever or that this release is so fantastic is really a stretch unless you are unfamiliar with the real prog greats...I would call this band \\"rave prog\\" since they lean to often to overdriven chaos. Maybe it is prog for people who also like crap house music or rave rock or whatever...They should focus on creating more memorable hooks here and there or something to bring you back too. This is something the true great prog bands did. An album worth checking out if you already have listened the Genesis' \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" or Marillion's \\"Script for A Jester's Tear\\" 10,000 times and need something new.
0316067598|4.0|This book was difficult to read emotionally knowing the price paid by these everyday heroes to protect us and our freedoms. Well written and detailed to the point you feel as though you knew these guys personally. Everyone struggling with the toll of war should be reminded on the ultimate sacrifice our armed forces make to insure our democracy and way of life.
B000MCH5P4|4.0|The movie drags a bit in some parts, its a movie where several stories get interconnected. The movie \\"crash\\" has a similar plot, and in each story it has to do with difficulty due to miscommunication... hence the apropriate name \\"Babel\\". Worth one watch, but can't say I plan to watch it again any time soon... or anytime at all.
B000SZLSB2|1.0|I wasn't impressed by James Blunt's first release either and maybe this is even worse.  There's one 'not that bad' song on the CD and it's - how come - the very first one. The rest is totally forgettable.  To me this man has nothing to say and it's really, really sad that such bad music gets such a hype and media attention. You can listen to his music many times and though it's hard to find one memorable tune. The lyrics are banal even for me whose mother-tongue isn't English.    What I don't understand is that if the media or record company wants to have a 'star' singer-songwriter, then why don't they pick one who really deserves it. I mean in this musical genre there's hundreds or thousands of artists that are a thousand time better in any respact than James Blunt.    This is really the prototype of music for people who aren't really into music and can easily be fooled with such a weak artist and his album.    If you really like music of this genre than rather check out Ron Sexsmith, Bright Eyes, Josh Ritter, Neil Young, Ben Harper, Wilco, Fionn Regan and many, many more.    Or buy a Best Of by Cat Stevens and you'll get much better music.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made. Tool has something to it where the first time you listen to it through you dont get it all. This is like all other tool albums in the fact that you listen to it and think that its OK, but like some fine wine after a few listens and you learn to fully appreciate the full beauty.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|As part of the \\"Grindhouse\\" experience this was great fun but, by itself, it's only a small portion of the whole. Putting it out in two DVDs is a cheap ploy to get your cash. It makes me think very little of the film makers supposed \\"aesthetic\\".<br />In a year, when they put out the whole thing, I may go back and buy it, but, right now, this is a bad idea. I can't reccomend it.
0670034711|1.0|At long last someone has written a book to help other miserable, upper-middle class white people transcend their sad, sad, lives! Gah. I can recall a far better book. It's called \\"Siddartha.\\"
B0000024JN|4.0|Classic but dated. If you looking for Beastie Boys albums that have great Hip-Hop beats and don't have that 80's Young MC/Run-DMC sound, purchase Ill Communication or Check Your Head. The Root Down Ep is also ace! If you're looking for some great instrumental Jazz/Funk/Lounge music, The In Sounds From Way Out is a great purchase. But if that 80's hip-hop sound is what you're looking for, this is the album to buy.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|If you're as big a fan of the Serenity 'verse as I am, you will love this DVD, even if you already own the original.  If you don't know what I'm talking about then you need to buy this DVD as well as the complete Firefly series as soon as possible.    Of course, I knew what to expect when buying this DVD.  There really isn't anything added to the film itself, but there are more extras on this 2 disc set.  The River Tam sesssions alone are worth the price of admission, in my opinion.  Also included are the Sci-Fi special and more with the cast and crew.    The packaging is excellent and the exclusive mail in offers for DVD buyers make it extra special for us die hard fans.    The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I think there is still more that could be added to this.  Anyone who loves Serenity as I do would practically kill for more material about our favorite freighter, it's crew, and the people who bring them to life.    For those who haven't seen the flick, you need to if you're a fan of intelligent, well crafted sci-fi.  The universe is well put together with no flaws that I could see and the characters are real people created by one of the industries best writers and brought to life by a dynamite cast.    If you're idea of great sci-fi is Star Wars and Independance Day, then you need to watch this movie to see what is well and truly good in science fiction.    Until Jar-Jar gets his own talk show, be cool.  Caermon
034544678X|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I have to say, I loved it!  The tone of the author is personable and not at all condescending.  She has some fascinating ideas about primates and canids and uses amazing sources to back them up.  This is not a training manual.  I see it as more as a guide to dog  and interspecies behavior that should accompany a training book and some real life classes.  I highly recommend this book!
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|After the melancholy undertones of her previous brilliant album, Bare, I didn't know what to expect from Annie's latest offering. The fact that the album was called \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" led me to believe it might be a bit more aggressive and edgy. It is that and a thousand times more.     Strong, fragile, angry, determined, inspired, inspiring, heartbreaking, devastated, hopeful, and fearlessly inventive. Overall, it's just an amazing accomplishment from an amazing artist. And it's great to see her rip into a song like she does more than once in this collection with all the conviction and emotional complexity of some of the legendary blues artists, sometimes pounding out over some driving rhythms that feel like a modern day battle cry.    Also, it's a less than subtle reminder that in the age of Britney, Linsay, Paris, and the rest of the blah-di-blahs, true art is accomplished with experience, intelligence and determination. Not to mention, that this 52-year-old rock goddess has more power and audacious brilliance in one raised eyebrow than all those 20-something train-wrecks combined. If this is what they consider \\"over the hill\\", I can't wait to get there.     A friend of mine said it best: \\"Annie is only reason to own ears. Period.\\" I couldn't agree more. So, thank you, Ms. Lennox, for reminding me why I love music and why it is an important art form.       PS. Downloading the album from iTunes has a few added treats, such as live versions of Walking On Broken Glass and Little Bird from the Diva album and audio commentaries for three of the songs from this album, Dark Road, Smithereens and Sing.
0810993139|5.0|My eight year old boy was having a difficult time finding things to read.  So I was relieved to find something besides Captain Underpants that he can get excited about.  The style of the book is accessible -- lots of white space, informal dialogue, and frequent cartoon illustrations.  It's about middle school, but younger children will still enjoy it.
B00006JDS4|4.0|I Think that Camille Keaton handled the attack with as much diginity as she could muster up, what she does afterward to each of them is well deserved.Rape and nude scenes so please beware, this 8o's film was raw and has become a true classic in the vein of Charles Bronson's 10 to midnight. This is a classic, get it while you can.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|The White Stripes continue to produce quality music.  So many good tracks on this album.  Great variety, unlike many bands today whose tracks all sound the same.  Great entertainment value with Jack's quirky sounds and lyrics.

1569242739|5.0|Buy this book now! DO NOT HESITATE! It is perfect! I even have a cupcake tattoo of one of the cupcakes! The coconut lime! It's to die for! The chocolate stout cupcakes amazed everyone, and they are perfect if you are in a pinch and don't have time to make frosting! My kids flipped over the cookies & cream cupcakes! I am anxious to try the pumpkin choc. chip for fall. The green tea cupcake would be so perfect for a bridal, or baby shower, they're so elegant. The next one I will try is the Brooklyn vs. Boston cream pie, they have a creamy custard filling! If you LOVE cupcakes YOU WILL LOVE THIS COOKBOOK!!!! It doens't matter if you are vegan or not, that would be a ridiculous reason to shun this book. People CANNOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE!!!! Plus, they are about a million percent HEALTHIER!
B000UJBYD8|3.0|Coming off the killer Instant Live series (I own every one of them), I was looking for an all out killer album in the \\"Electric\\"/\\"Sonic Temple\\" groove.  How disappointed I was after the first couple of listens. Demo quality production, very tame songs, and Billy Duffy's lead guitar is totally MIA.  There is not one decent solo or even riff on the entire record.    Another thing which struck me, \\"Dirty Little Rockstar\\" cops it's riff directly from the Rolling Stones tune \\"Undercover\\" (check out the sample here: \\"[[ASIN:B000000W68 Rolling Stones-Undercover]]\\").  The overall sound of the album owes more to \\"War\\" era U2 than anything  in the entire Cult back catalog; this album is more power pop than hard rock.    A few more listens softened my disappointment a bit, but not enough to make me reach for this again anytime soon.  If you are a die hard fan like me, you know you're gonna get this album.  This \\"Special Edition\\" version with the extra disc is the way to go.  The songs \\"Stand Alone\\" & \\"War Pony  Destroyer\\" on the bonus disc are as good as any on the main album and justify spending a few more bucks.   Hold off, however, and search zShops in a few weeks to save some cash.  If you are new to the band, my album recommendation is threefold: \\"Electric\\", \\"Love\\" & \\"Instant Live: Nokia Theatre-New York\\".
B00005JM02|4.0|It's strange how this movie divides people: Some consider it really good, while some others consider it too childish. I prefer to consider it average, measured by Pixar's standards. The image quality and DVD transfer, however, are awesome: As far as I know, this was transferred directly from the digital masters (not via film like most movies at that time), and Pixar was kind enough to make a \\"full-widescreen\\" framing for this DVD. That is, they chose to fill a 16:9 screen with the image, instead of leaving black bars to preserve the cinemascope aspect ratio (which is the case with all later Pixar releases). The image quality and detail, too, are so good that this is one of the best DVDs to put in your player if you really want to see the benefits of S-Video and Component Video connections over a Composite connection. Highly recommended if you own a Widescreen TV or projector and wish to take full advantage of all its expensive pixels.
0143038419|1.0|Unless you want to waste your time reading about a smug, self-centered woman who is so selfish that she walks out on her marriage to pursue her own petty desires, don't bother reading this tripe.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I do not mean \\"dark\\" in a metaphorical sense... The image itself is quite dark. I've tried to calibrate my projector to watch this movie, but it just does not look good... Someone really exaggerated with the image post-processing here, or perhaps the DVD was poorly mastered. However, it does fill completely my 16:9 which is really nice (unlike most movies that show black bars even in 16:9 sets), and the movie itself is not that bad, it's just... very 30's, and a little bit too \\"photoshopped\\". =).
0316067598|5.0|Thank you Marcus Luttrell for your service to this country and continuing to fight the good fight. The book was a real eye opener to the sacrafice our brave men and women make, and the destructive harm the free loading liberal hippies of this country have on our armed forces. Even on Michael Murphy's home on Long Island, the local newspaper, Newsday, could not write a half decent piece that highlights his bravery and heroics.   The thought of Navy SEALs dying needlessly because the communist left are more than willing to crucify those who will fight for this country is sickening. But despite all that, I am glad the good old U.S. of A still has men like you to stand up when the left calls for defeat. God Bless Navy Seals!!! God Bless Texas!!!!
0140557741|5.0|The series of pictures in Zoom are fascinating discussion prompters and for the adept trainer (in areas of communication, leadership, problem-solving, decision-making, etc.) they pose endless possibilities for engaging and meaningful workshops about not having the full picture, the importance of understanding the world around us, or utilizing specific communication or leadership techniques to solve problems.
B00000BKI4|5.0|Pretty much every minute detail that can be said about this album has been previously posted, so I will say this for those already familiar with Mercury Rev but have not heard this album:    Deserter's Songs is what happens when you ask Mercury Rev to compose a soundtrack to a Broadway musical. Its use of a full band and strings, odd studio trickery, bowed saws, and epic and sometimes gratuitous, melodramatic moments create a whimsical, musical journey. From the noirish \\"Holes\\" which starts the album to the chipper closer, \\"Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp,\\" you can almost picture the red curtain going down while Mercury Rev waves goodbye on stage.     This sort of sound may or may not appeal to fans of older Mercury Rev. To me, its just another progression in Mercury Rev's ever-changing personnel and it sounds wonderful. For maximum aural satisfaction, however, I suggest listening to this album all the way through, as this is a concept album, and its effect would be greatly undermined by selecting random tracks.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I'm a great Micheal Buble fan since he has such great voice quality, can sing spot on pitch, and his style of basically easy listening suits me fine.  I do agree with some other reviewers that he tends to lisp on some of the selections--that's a little distracting.  The mix of selections is very good--I just don't care for \\"That's Life\\" with its gospel-sounding background.  That arrangement ruins that particular song for me.  All in all, this is a great CD to get.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|This new album is just bad.  Bruce ought to stick to the bizarre folk stuff he was playing.  Sadly, this album proves that he's too old to rock and roll any more.
B000GTJT0W|5.0|This movie is everything a movie should be: witty (Steve Zahn makes the movie), full of action, beautiful scenery and superb acting.  There are good issues and messages in there but they are not preachy.  The extras are well worth the watch.      I use this disc to compare HD quality, its a fantastic print.
1565115147|4.0|great perspective other than what we in western cultures traditionally have in in our relations with 3rd world countries
B000P0J02E|5.0|I was mildly disappointed with the Dead Man's Chest soundtrack (especially that horrible remix at the end.) So, I waited to buy the 3rd soundtrack, not knowing what to expect. But I must say...WOW!<br />This is the most moving and beautiful of the 3 pirate soundtracks. Did I say beautiful? Yes, I did. I have listened to it over and over again. I highly recommend this over the other Pirate movie scores. I rate this one right up with Zimmer's masterpieces \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Batman Begins\\".
0743539133|4.0|great look at the inner workings of the executive branch This cabinet was hardly a \\"team\\". In comparison to the way cabinets members are selelected in our era of political, Lincoln showed incredible political courage to select this  group.
0316067598|3.0|Marcus Luttrell was brave, skilled, and lucky. His story is an amazing one. I knew going in that the book would have the obligatory \\"training chapters\\", which in this case went on a bit too long. However, I do feel they showed the training payoff in what happened in the battle. But while reading his story I kept coming across several instances that set off my BS meter and just didn't ring true. Was this the co-author trying to spice things up, with a future film deal in mind?       For instance, faulty communications right when discovered? They'd have been doing comm checks on a regular basis, not be surprised with no comms. Later on Lutrell has the team leader heroically making a cell phone call that miraculously get through to call for help. Only he has to expose himself in the open to do so. Well, did it just then occur to him that he had a cell phone? And it worked down in the valley and not up on a mountain? The vote on killing the herders. The whole goatherder discovering them story reeks of the SAS  Bravo Two Zero, which got made into a movie. He has all the team members dying heroically with 4 or 5 gunshot wounds. Claiming the Taliban purposely fired RPGs only when the copter opened its doors. An RPG that will destroy a tank has no problem going thru a helicopter door!      Fact is, we just don't know what really happened, and odds are, he doesn't know or even remember everything either. I've read other accounts of this action, and they are similar but with some glaring discrepancies.
006085880X|2.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult book, and may be my last. I felt like  I was climbing up a steep hill, never to reach the top. The book starts out with a murder ?, suicide ?, and goes downhill from there. Tedious trial, and many unanswered questions. Why was this teenage girl so miserable and unhappy? Some hints of abuse, but nothing is clear or validated. Her parents were clueless. Depressing story, with really no answers, not a romantic love story.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Well, I guess I am a huge fan still. Um, I loved her since she came out when I was ten. I'm 28 now, and this \\"featuring\\" after song titles is getting on my nerves. I'm getting too old for hip-hop. I can't so much relate to the young and angry anymore. Why does she cater to them?? She is abusing the talent bestowed upon her by having people talk over her. My only guess and hope is that it's for money. I don't want her to be a sellout like she is fast approaching, but I do want to hear later albums in hopes that someday Mariah Carey, the SINGER, comes back. Oh how I miss songs like \\"melt away\\".
032147404X|5.0|This book is very easy to read. The book gives a lot of easy pointers that will make your pictures stand out from the ordinary photographer.  The author puts his own brand of humor in the book that you may or may not like. I personally liked it.
B00007G207|5.0|This three hour film flows beautifully from the opening credits through the heart-touching close. This story of a young boy growing up in Italy with a passion for film grabs the viewer and creates a love affair with the characters. It is wonderfully acted and should stand as a classic amongst foreign films.
0143038419|5.0|What a funny memoir. This romp of a magazine writer's  travels across the world took a year. She was in search of pleasure and some meaning to her life . . . something to give it balance.<br /><br />Liz is a cute blond in her thirties. She has no kids and doesn't have to worry about money. A divorce happens as divorces will. She has a rebound affair, as one will do. Crying in the middle of the night on the floor of the bathroom, she begins to pray for guidance.<br /><br />That night marks the beginning of Gilbert's \\"conversation with God.<br /><br />She finds a spiritual teacher who is an Indian guru with lots of followers. She starts to chant with a group of her followers in New York, \\"regular-looking people praying to God.\\"<br /><br />The book is a fun read and reminds me of the things that many women of her age tend to go through and how many of them handle those issues. At least, how many wish they could handle them.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000URDEB0|2.0|I've heard and liked every Nightwish release--until this one.  The songwriting is mostly good but I can't get over how lousy the new singer is.  Listen to the clip of the first track, on this site, and tell me she's not singing off-key.    Nightwish's songwriting has never been good enough to withstand lousy vocals.  This band will probably be done in three years.
0316067598|2.0|Its a shame that if one thinks a book about warriors is poorly written (as well as poorly labeled..) that it is assumed that you must be 'liberal' (translation: commie traitor who cavorts with the likes of Hanoi Jane Traitor Whore), a non-combat vet, or just plain ole retarded.      Eduardo's review summed it up perfectly.  I bought the book to read a first-hand account of what went down on Murphy's ridge, not to oohh and ahhh over how hard BUDS is, or how much Texans love themselves.  The book is poorly written, strays way off topic, and the author is distractingly pompous.    To be honest, this is a book that I'd recommend to a high school kid who is interested in becoming a Navy SEAL - maybe.  For an accurate AAR of the battle (that educated grown-ups will find interesting), I will be looking elsewhere; this book - while serving as a formidable pat on one's own Texan Navy SEAL back - is found wanting as far as inside accounts of historic battles go.  Generally speaking, this book is a waste of time; light on content and heavy on rhetoric.     Hoo-Rahh Master Chief, God Bless Texas, blah blah blah.
0060594896|5.0|Then get this book.  This book is a big book, and worth the read.  In my opinion, it's the bible for success. I believe in it so much, I now follow Jack's format to coach my clients because it's logical and concise.  If you want success in your personal growth, then read the book, and after you have finished, reread it.  Good luck in your journey!
B000RW3YYA|3.0|Just finished watching it. I liked the adding of depth to the wraith who saved Sheperd. This (and developing some of the characters) should have happened. The replacaters!! AGAIN!!!! Give me a break! There are plenty of other enemies without dredging up old ones. Even if you haven't watched Sg1 there are already plenty of enemies in Atlantis without them. Stargate-SG1 went in too many directions and left too many unresolved stories.  (in seasons 1-8) I hope Atlantis doesn't follow suit.   I watched the feature about the making of \\"Sunday\\". Yeah! You wanted an emotional show about losing a major actor! You picked the wrong one!! You mentioned knowing that the show had been picked up for another year. You should have waited until you were canceled to kill him!!! We love the actors from \\"firefly\\" but at least Sg-1 created a new character instead of killing one of the favorites. Why didn't you kill Zelenske?? His accent turns on and off more than our taps! You killed one of our favorite characters in the ancient weapon satelite. Not a major part of show but we miss him.  Now that I'm off my soap box I will say that the Stargate shows aren't like other sci-fi shows that treat audiences like morons!! We've learned a great deal about Science and the nature of all thinking beings.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|To show my taste, Darkness On The Edge Of Town, Born To Run, Born In The USA, The River... are my favorites..I am disappointed in this cd .I think the band needs to either downsize (as in not having 4 guitars drowning each other out), or take turns...I thought this was supposed to be a rocking album...not for me
B000IFQLBE|3.0|I read the other reviews, but had to hear it for myself. John is the same ultimate professional - excellent singer/songwriter/guitarist. And I'm sure he liked hiring John Molo to accomapny him on drums. Now John is a very good drummer. But the extra fills, rolls, crashes kill the Creedence numbers. It sounds like a Las Vegas cover band with John playing this way. Doug Clifford was the right drummer for Creedence; he didn't overplay. This release is just okay. On the shelf next to the originals, I'll reach for Creedence every time, so what's the point in having/keeping  this concert cd? I guess it's kind of similar with the Beatles. The original recordings were so good, no matter how well Paul Mc. played Beatle tunes in concert, they never sounded as good as with the boys.   Plus the amount of time on the discs kind of cheats the public also.  My copy of this will go up for sale soon.
B000G8NY4U|4.0|Yanni in this DVD tops an absolute excellent performance including all of his musicians.    Sound is most masterful recorded on this DVD.   Unfortunately this high class performance of Yanni is currently issued only on DVD yet. It would be worth and wise to have it on blu-ray to match this masterful performance with an equal top sharp picture quality such as it would be available on blu-ray.
B000001ESN|5.0|After 30 years of listening to Rush and never feeling like I had a clear favorite album by them, I've spent time listening to \\"Snakes & Arrows\\", which I really, really, REALLY like. Suddenly it dawns on me that if I ever had to choose just one Rush album to take to that mythical deserted island, \\"Permanent Waves\\" would be the one. Sure, \\"Moving Pictures\\" is the Rush signature, \\"2112\\" is the breakout, and \\"Signals\\" the philosophical homage to modernity and its issues, but \\"PW\\" is the one that is most evocative of everything Rush has done. \\"Natural Science\\" is the second-to-last great Rush opus (along with \\"The Camera Eye\\"), and \\"Spirit of Radio\\" is just as wonderful a radio oriented song as \\"Tom Sawyer\\". The real highlight of this album for me is \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", a mystical, dynamic song filled with near-impossible time signatures and cool lyrics, and of course the classic Rush bass sound with Alex's ethereal guitar arching over the top. \\"Entre Nous\\" is a song I like, but if there is a weakest song here, that is it. Oh, yeah, I nearly forgot - Rush doesn't get any more \\"Rush\\" than on \\"Freewill\\" - the fantastic solos, Randian lyrics, explosive drumming and again, Alex just soaring... reminds me of \\"Red Barchetta\\" a bit. Hmmm. Looks like I'll have to take TWO Rush CD's - this one and \\"Moving Pictures\\" after all. They really are quite inseparable.

I love all the different methods Donna Kato talks aout, and she writes so well, it is so easy to read, and she makes you feel like it is the easist thing in the world.  I love just looking at the images in this book as well.  The only thing I would say I don't like about this is book, is that several of the projects are japanease style, but this doesn't make any difference bcuase you can create whatever designs you want to.  If you thinking about a polymer clay book-to extend your knowledge then don't hestiate to buy this one!
0385486804|4.0|While I'll say this book was a very good and very easy read...the basis of the storyline still bugs the hell out of me. How in the end this kid gets glorified with the whole \\"free spirit\\" thing is beyond me. He ventures into one of the most dangerous and unforgiving places in the world with basically some rice, a .22 caliber rifle with ammo, and some boots. What realistic outcome was this guy expecting? I would consider myself on the higher end of the \\"outdoorsman\\" scale and would never even consider setting out on a venture minus a map, any kind of emergency beacon/phone, or even an itinerary to give to someone else. This was a recipe for disaster from the get go...and anyone who ran into him shortly before the trek toward the bus knew it. This guy had some mental issues or was just plain delusional (or stoned), from the outset. This book caused me to do some serious homework on the real facts and issues at hand with Chris. I'm convinced he was either having some serious lapses in judgement due to medical reasons or he was into drugs. The fact that he gave away or squandered all of his money and assets makes me think it was in his head. The fact that he wasn't far from a hand-tram that would've gotten him by the river makes you wonder if he didn't want to get out of there...distress messages or not.

B0002O06N0|4.0|Since they're from Ohio, you know they've got to be cool. And if you're young, these guys sound like the BOMB. But, if you are my age and experienced late sixties/ early 70's rock, you would've heard the super rock band FREE, and their radio friendly anthem, All Right Now. The Black Keys sound just like FREE to me, the singer's vocal phrasing, his tone, the drumming, and the guitar playing. But FREE had a great bass player, Andy Fraser, the Black Keys don't even have a bass player. Check out FREE.  Once you check out FREE, you'll see where the Black Keys are coming from.
B000SZLSB2|5.0|Listening to this cd reminded me of what it feels like to REALLY be in love and be so connected, soul-to-soul, to another human being.  It's something I'd forgotten.  Thank you, James Blunt!  I LOVE this music.  And by the way, since I graduated from high school in 1973, I couldn't NOT buy this cd.  Now I'm SO GLAD I did.
B000OPOANE|5.0|I added the next two paragraphs July 3, 2008. After listening to S&A over the past 6 months or so I can say that it has turned out to be a little more of a mixed effort than I first thought. \\"Armor & Sword\\" has been my favorite track for a while now, and \\"Larger Bowl\\" and \\"Faithless\\" aren't quite holding up as well. One thig that surprised me is that this CD has caused me to go back and listen to Vapor Trails and T4E again, and I especially like Vapor Trails a LOT more than I did before S&A.<br /><br />I'm getting tired of all these people here whining that Rush doesn't sound like they did pre-Moving Pictures. Hey - those great 70's and early 80's CDs are still in print. I listen to them often. Things change. Rush is still sharp, top-notch and precise. Go see a live show and you'll (hopefully) get it, unless you are that guy who sat behind me in LA and constantly complained that they didn't perform \\"Hemispheres\\" in its entirety. Yeah, that would have been awesome, but it's not 1978 any more. S&A is great stuff all on its own.<br /><br />S & A is one dynamic CD. Rush has come dangerously close to becoming a \\"dinosaur\\" a few times, but this is not one of those times. There are some very strong tracks on this CD, and \\"Spindrift\\", \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" \\"Bravest Face\\" and \\"We Hold On\\" are the highlights for me, at least today. \\"Bravest Face\\" is probably the all around best track, and one of the 10 best songs Rush has come up with since the \\"Signals\\" days. This is definitely not a \\"formula album\\", especially considering that most popular music these days is exactly that. Sure, \\"Far Cry\\" and \\"Workin' Them Angels\\" will get plenty of AOR play, but even those songs tend to be more dynamic, intricate and definitely more complex musically than just about anything else out there. The classic Rush songwriting is all here - Neil doesn't shy away from his well known penchant for drawing inspiration from Ayn Rand, and it is actually refreshing to see the band make a statement against the common practice of blindly accepting a (or any) system of belief and then spouting the dogma as if it were our own (\\"Faithless\\" and \\"Wind\\"). Intelligent songwriting, fantastic bass, percussion and guitar, and a sense of nearing the limits of sonic expression are what Rush has always been about for me, from \\"2112\\" right through \\"Counterparts\\". Yes, \\"T4E\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\" left me thinking that Rush's best days were behind them, but here they are, roaring back full force. This CD has some of Neil's best work, and the production finally sounds right... not the too-heavy, sometimes muddy bass of \\"Counterparts\\" and not the tinny shrill feel of some of the songs on \\"T4E\\". This is Rush's best offering since \\"Roll the Bones\\", and maybe since \\"Signals\\". That says a lot, considering we are talking about 25 years of work...practice of blindly accepting a (or any) system of belief and then spouting the dogma as if it were our own (\\"Faithless\\" and \\"Wind\\").

1594200823|5.0|I'd recommend that everyone go out and read this book. It will remind you that eating is a political and ethical act. It certainly reminded me of that.<br /><br />Omnivore's Dilemma can be summarized very quickly: Michael Pollan eats four meals, and tracks down where they all come from. It is a brilliantly simple conceit, and could only be pulled off well by a writer as gregarious, warmhearted, easygoing and scientifically rigorous as Pollan. He wants to know where McDonald's comes from, so he goes into a cornfield, follows the corn through cows on its way to becoming beef, and visits the \\"Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations\\" (CAFOs) in which they're slaughtered. He interviews corn farmers. He explains the perverse incentives which have motivated corn growers to produce more and more of the stuff, even when it's not needed. (The government pays them the difference between some set price and the current market price. Hence farmers have an incentive to produce as cheaply as possible.) This is one of the reasons why we as a nation are growing fatter and fatter.<br /><br />Pollan takes it a step further, though, making something explicit that had never occurred to me: the fact that our country is so nutritionally faddish, leaping from fruit diets to hourly enemas to high-carb diets to high-protein diets, is a sign of something deeply dysfunctional in our relationship to food. Pollan never really figures out why we might have this relationship. The lack of a distinctive national cuisine might have something to do with it, he says, but the end effect is clear: we don't eat well, and nowadays we're as likely as not to microwave something and eat it in the car. The family meal has been destroyed, and with it the sense of community that food fosters in healthy societies. Pollan's writing is meticulous and heartfelt, and it made me desperately want to change the way I eat.<br /><br />After McDonald's Pollan paints the bright side of the American meal: places like Polyface Farms that are growing more-than-organic food: food that is completely sustainable and delicious. Cows, pigs, and chickens roam widely on a carefully maintained schedule that keeps the grass growing at the optimal rate. The farm produces almost no waste: every last bit of organic matter feeds the next step in the cycle. It's something of an agrarian utopia  . . .  and it's probably completely unrealistic for feeding a nation of 300 million people. Indeed, says Pollan, our nation certainly would have capped out at a much smaller population had we not had industrial farming. (It's a reasonable counterfactual, but it's debatable.)<br /><br />After he visits a self-sustaining farm, Pollan tramps off into the wild to hunt and forage for his own food. Also not sustainable at large scale, but that's not the point: Pollan is trying to reorient us to what meals are about, and how they're philosophically and ethically larger than just what's on the plate.<br /><br />Pollan's book has made me want to try being a vegetarian again. My girlfriend used to be a vegan, but has turned around 180 degrees and eats a high-protein meat diet. (Atkins vegans are, I imagine, hard to come by.) So the vegetarian thing might have to wait a bit. Being vegetarian isn't really the sine qua non in Pollan's book, though; if anything is, it's short food chains: knowing where your food came from, using food to support your community, and reducing the amount of petroleum necessary to get it to your door. (If peak oil ever comes, bananas may be history.) Joining a CSA is well within my power, and I intend to do so soon.<br /><br />If I have any gripe about Omnivore's Dilemma, it's small: Pollan is a bit too self-satisfied. At one point he eats a meal in the car with wife and child, driving at 65 miles per hour down the highway in California. I don't actually believe that he wanted to do that. I can hear him saying to himself, \\"This would make an excellent story for my newspaper article.\\" Likewise whenhe's reading Peter Singer in a steakhouse. If more of the book seemed like Pollan being Pollan, it'd be perfect.<br /><br />As it is, it is just about perfect. I intend to buy a copy just to have around to shove into people's hands. It's a life-changing sort of book.re of the book seemed like Pollan being Pollan, it'd be perfect.    As it is, it is just about perfect.

B000UR366S|5.0|Let me begin by saying I've been  a Joni fan for decades. Since I was a prepubescent 12 yr. lying in bed listening to my older bros, and sisters albums to,  well now......... I'm on my first listen as I type. This album has a very good flow to it with all the songs fitting nicely into one another, and I know I'm going to like it more with each play. It's reminiscent of Paparika Plains with nice orchestration and instrumentation. Chord changes are interesting but not too esoteric for the masses. My only complaint, is the production/engineering aspects of this album. This recording sounds like it was recorded in a makeshift Studio/ Starbucks with an aspiring Starbucks/Crewchief at the controls. Slight distortion at many levels thru the phones (I'm monitoring thru high-quality Sennheiser cans here) I'm just calling it like it is. Reminiscent of my old record player when the needle gathered a little too much dust. At least I could blow on that and all good for awhile. Probably some hotshot(oops starbucks again) Berklee grad helpng out. Surprising to say the least. Otherwise, don't let this stop you from adding this one to your collection, songwriting is King, and Joni is the Queen :)
B000RZIGZ4|4.0|This picture looks absolutely stunning on HD DVD. Close-ups are extremely sharp. Colors looks much more bold then on the standard definition dvd release. I only have a 720P capable set, so I can only imagine how it would look on a 1080P set. Trust me when I tell you that the DTS soundtrack sounds better then the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack. if your receiver can decode DTS, its a must to fully enjoy the sounds of this flick. The only reason im not giving this release a full five stars is that there are no special features whatsoever. I have to say that was a little disapointing. Definitely worth the $20 though!
B000OVLBEO|4.0|I've been a fan of GR a long time I collected some of the comic books from the second series with Dan Ketch being GR. I have to say Nicolas Cage does a good job playing Johnny Blaze. The story is not exactly the same as the comic book as far as origin goes but I still enjoyed it. I thought the CG effects were freaking awesome. You really believed Cage is the Ghost Rider, the bike looked amazing too. The only thing that bothered me was  Spoilers below!                  I felt that all the villains in the movie were defeated by Ghost rider with little effort. I would have liked to seen GR get thrown around a bit and the fight actually last longer then a min. I thought the demons could have been a little more creative.  It would have been cool if  the Ghost rider did some hunting at night you know prowl the streets to  avenge innocent blood that is spilled. Maybe the sequel will have more of that. Lets hope we have some cool villains in the next movie Deathwatch,Blackout,Lilith. They can do so much with Ghost Rider.
B0000524CY|5.0|I think I speak for all Americans when I say that I am SO glad Linda Blair turned out ok. This is a shocker to end all shockers. I went to see the re-release in theaters four times in one week. I wanted to see peoples reactions who had not seen the movie. On a couple of occasions I heard grown men gasp.
B000VDDWE2|5.0|This movie's transfer to High def is incredible.  The movie as a whole has some major science flaws, but as a summer block-buster type film it is a lot of fun.<br />Many people are reporting problems loading.  If you do have this problem, you need to just simply update your firm-ware.  With all of the new definition players this is a regular part of the maintenance.  It may be kind of a pain, but when you think about it, it is a nicer option than having to buy a whole new player to get newer features to work.  I remember when I had a first gen SD-DVD player and they went to dual layer, mine would often stick and not proceed onto the next layer.  I just recently updated the firm-ware on my PS3 and had no problems when this title arrived.
B00000I2I7|4.0|Eight of the twelve tracks are fantastic, and only one is noticeably bad. The Lazarus Heart, Be Still my Beating Heart, and if it weren't for the chorus, Straight to my Heart, stand among Sting's best works. His sultry rendition of Little Wing is astounding; I've never before or after heard Sting's voice sound so good and the strangely haunting, yet fitting guitar work make the notes palpable. However, the CD's sound quality unfortunately suffers from a purely digital recording in what was still CD's embryonic stage. But despite the sheer-miss that is We'll be Together, the superfluous, The Secret Marriage (at the very least it should've come before Little Wing, and not tried to follow it) and the completely misplaced Rock Steady, the remaining tracks range from damn fine to masterful, and as a work that stands as a tribute and a memorial to the worst loss a son ever and, inevitably will face, the album is an exquisite achievement.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Lets open up the book, I was a fan of the series when I first saw the pilot and thought the movie was ok. What the movie did for me was some kind of tribute to the series, had everything I hoped for but missed the special character interaction that was in the series. The small pauses that you developed and learned more about them. But as a film, its is one of the best sci-fi movies out there, beating George Lucas recents film on his nose.    Serenity (Collector´s Edition)´s box is special and beutiful, I cannot say the feeling when I hold it for the first time. The picture is of River, Mal and the ship Serenity and when you open the box. But the utter layer is plastic and contains only the picture of River, and when you open the box left is Mal and Serenity. Like if little synopsis to the story, that River is one way part of the serenity but also a outsider to it. I just love the idea and love the box.    So what does the Collectors edition contain you wonder? The film of course, which I describe my opinions above. But what would the collectors edition be if not all the extra content. The collectors edition is 2 disc, and one contains alot of content like documentaries (Sci-Fi Inside), walking through serenity, and interview with Joss. It also contain bloopers and the guerilla marketing campaing of Sesson 416 which is a nice bonus. And also new commentary track by some of the cast. Overall the extra content is intressting and special, and it feels right for being a collectors edition.     My opinion about the box is buy it if you are a fan of either collectors editions of DVDs or of the series/movie.

0143038419|3.0|Considering all the hype this book is getting, I finally read it. I liked the first and third part mostly but actually got bored with the middle. Having grown up abroad and hardly lived in my country of birth this book is a bit tame, uneventful to me.  If you have not travelled abroad then this book would surely wet your appetite and make you realize that there is a whole different world out there that you might like to explore and get to know, as well as its people.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Well its definately the release of the year in this household. What a sublime set of intelligent well constructed classic rock tracks this release has. I can't stop playing it. And fear not the name Desmond Child either, because to these ears he has pushed the Scorps to their best effort in a long long time if not of all time.<br /><br />\\"Hour 1\\" kicks off proceedings with military precission, a tytanic build up to a rip-snorter of a chorus that won't leave your head any time soon. A loose concept runs through this disc and this song is the scene-setter, warning us if we don't change our ways we will loose our humanity, 'try to stay down, you better run for cover underground' the final consequence when machines finally rule the world. Building off the pace set by the premier song we have the first of many highlights in \\"The Game Of Life\\". A subtle builder leading to another winning chorus, the passion in the vocals and guitar work is heart stopping. I love it. Just when you can't believe the song can get better it has a fantastic bridge and classy guitar solo to help your jaw drop further.<br /><br />\\"We Were Born to Fly\\" launches off some aggressive (relatively speaking) guitar work to an atmospheric vocal. It contains a sublime couplet 'take another breath, just close your eyes let nature do the rest' and is another five star plus moment. Simple piano work leads us into \\"The Future Never Dies\\" before exploding soncially as it climbs the keys with lush orchestration abound. Beautiful lyrically and musically. It reminds me a little of Queen at their most glorious and most pompous, and I hear a little of \\"Winds Of Change\\" an ecclectic mix but a very succesful one.

0609610570|3.0|I thought there were many good take-aways in this book.  Was it all original?  Of course not.  Most management books are saying the same things with a slightly different twist.  I've got a bookshelf full of them.  However, it seems that humans are so often incapable of remembering the fundamentals and have a tendency to overcomplicate things thus history repeats itself over and over.      The tone of the book regarding people gave me a little pause.  Although I do think they were spot on in their assessment of how many companies do succession planning (not at all or incorrectly), it does seem to advocate that everyone needs to be a mini-Jack Welch type persona.  I've worked in a company managed by ex-GE guys and believe me, they don't have it all figured out.  I think organizations will benefit by having a mix of skills.  Some people are better doers and others are better thinkers.  Some superstars are good at both.  It takes all types.
B00000DATR|5.0|In the course of human history, ever since the first hints at any musical appreciation whatsoever, we have remembered those who stood out among their peers during their time. Those who appreciate good music recall the names of Hildegard von Bingen, Beethoven, Bach, Ray Charles, The Beatles, and on and on. To all of you who have not heard this piece of music or are not familiar with the music of Mike Oldfield, let me say that for as long as humanity exists in the universe, and for as long as that humanity has an appreciation for music, that humanity will know the music of Mike Oldfield.<br />I am a devoted fan, but I believe that this man will be recognized as one of our kind's most talented, imaginative, and gifted artists for centuries and perhaps eons to come. If you have the opportunity to hear this man's music, even if from the roadside while the neighbor plays it in the comfort of their home, you will be blessed with a wondrous gift. This is true not just of TBIII, but the two prior Tubular Bells creations, and then every other peice of music created by this God-given genius of glorious sound. Mike Oldfield could sit on the hood of a car and stomp on the hood and windshield with his bare feet, and make it sound like the songs of the angels. If you have any sense at all, do not pass up the opportunity to hear this man's music now and for the remainder of your life.
0783114893|5.0|I love this movie.  It falls into one of my top favorites. Very suspenseful. I'm not going to rehash plot, you can read it from others. There is no other than Rutger Hauer to play the roll so CREEPY. He truly does a wonderful job. C Thomas Howell does too. There is a part where the sheriff says \\"I don't know what the connection is between you two?\\" And you don't till the end. The ending for me always has me questioning is John Ryder (Hauer) Just a man or a little supernatural?? My only complaint is quality of DVD could be a little better. Choose this over remake.
B000UZ4G8M|5.0|It is a beautiful collection of wonderful music. It is involving and infectious. And if you are a Grey's Anatomy fan, well you cannot miss the soundtrack. It will recall at your memory the peculiar moment of the serial.
B00000JNNY|5.0|To hear the purity of Etta James is to be as close to perfection as is possible on this planet. \\"At Last\\" alone is worth the price of this phenomenal collection of soulful exuberant song collection. I cannot praise too highly when I tell you that this music has uplifted my very being, just from the deep feeling this woman has given to each note - each syllable. Whether she is rocking with Harvey Fuqua (of the Moonglows) on the song \\"It's A Crying Shame\\" or doing her own very special take on the classic \\"Stormy Weather\\" in a reach-right-into-your-gut variation, the ride you take is a thrilling one in so many ways.    I fell in love with this song all over again when I heard a singer at a favorite resort do this number and strangely enough when a ventriloquist through a puppet sang this title song that I just had to own this CD and I'm so glad I did. Etta James has joined Aretha Franklin for me as the royalty of soulful music. And that's saying something since I fell hard for Aretha while still in my teens so many years ago.    \\"Sunday Kind Of Love\\" is another cut that deserves high praise. The phrasing alone is superb, and if these songs don't touch you, I would seriously consider a soul transplant.    If you love music that moves you and makes you glad you're alive, this CD is a MUST.
B000000I0I|5.0|I simply adore Ommadawn. I have listened to it innumerable times over almost twenty years. Not only do I never tire of this wondrous creation, I find the occasional moment when I hear something within it I did not hear before. If a day comes when I feel beaten down or depressed, I can listen to the music of Mike Oldfield and bask in the joy of knowing I lived at a time in history when one of humanity's finest musicians lived, and I can find unexpressable hope in knowing I might one day be able to hear this man in person. Imagine this- Having the profound privelige of seeing Mike Oldfield perform live, and then being cryogenically frozen for thousands of years. The people of that future day will see you as amazing simply because you were afforded that opportunity. People will want to know you, and they will want to touch you. Man, imagine the babes...

1400064287|5.0|Jake, a young entrepreneurial friend of mine in the IT industry , was not seeing the results he expected from numerous and inventive marketing strategies. He had tried online, print and direct marketing with marginal results. His business wasn't faltering but wasn't soaring either. So after a slew of marketing books he came across this one- and it was all I was hearing about from him until I read it myself and the light bulb clicked.<br /><br />Just like you were interested in Jake's story other people like stories, they want to relate to you and your product but if they can't they will find a company that they can relate to.<br /><br />Chip and Dan Heath give great examples every chapter on how to improve your \\"Stickiness\\" with simple strategies. The most important being their coined,<br />\\"SUCCES\\" acronym:<br /><br />S simple - don't lose your core message in a lot of pomp and circumstance<br />U unexpected - make your idea jump out and grab people's attention<br />C concrete - keep it easy to grasp vs. mind boggling statistics or huge numbers<br />C credible - is your idea believable?<br />E emotional - people react to emotion and it creates an empathetic bond<br />S stories - story telling is an age old form of communication<br /><br />I have been able to use \\"Made To Stick\\" concepts in my business with great results. I used to feel that stories in real estate investing wouldn't interest anyone but I knew from the book that stories were useful, if not crucial, in creating and growing a business. Now by using my customer's concrete feedback blended with their credible testimonials and sprinkled with a little emotion I am able transmit their core experience (what they got out of working with us an how it translated to their bottom line) to reach a greater audience.
B00005JPTA|4.0|This film takes us not into the Underground of the famous London Tube, but rather into the underbelly of society with the Russian mob.  A dead body has tatoos of stars on its knees and the Scotland Yard Russian expert says it is the mark of the Vory V Zakone, the Russian mafia, and means \\"he will never kneel\\".  We have been thrust into this world in the violent opening moments of the film, and soon Anna (Naomi Watts), a young Midwife of Russian descent working in a London hospital will find herself accidentally enmeshed in that same incredibly dangerous world.    A tragic incident and good intentions cause Anna to cross paths with the violent villains of the Russian underworld, most especially the cooly enigmatic Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), ostensible chauffeur but obviously something much more lethal, the ebulliant Kirill (Vincent Cassel), explosive and unpredictable son of Semoyan (Armin Mueller-Stahl), patriarchal and genial restaurateur whose overt civility cannot completely disguise a sinister undertone that even the somewhat naive Anna recognizes.    Ably directed by David Cronenberg with his usual invention, the look and atmosphere of the film is incredibly dense.  He takes us fully into this world, and he is greatly aided by the fine performances of his actors.  Viggo Mortensen's Nikolai has the presence of a coiled snake, wrapped tight and severely restrained and disciplined but ready to strike at any moment.  It is nuanced and subtle performance.  Cassell is fine as the troubled and dangerous son.  Naomi Watts can do no wrong for my money.  And Armin Mueller-Stahl is completely marvelous and chilling as a man of many parts, masking a ruthless pragmatist capable of anything.    Cronenberg does violence with graphic cruelty, and there are several brief but harsh scenes with grisly detail.  The already famous fight scene in the baths with a naked Mortensen battling knife wielding assassins is a directorial tour de force.  But this violence glimpsed early on lends an atmosphere of menace and dread throughout the film that is appropriate.  The audience, like Anna, does not live in this world and once involved with it, reluctantly or not, fear is the order of the day.    The film has a twist or two along the way, and the arc of the relationship between Anna and Nikolai is nicely done and makes sense to the story, yet we wish for more.  And it is perhaps an irony that adhering to the logic of the story and the world depicted results in the little something missing other reviewers have noted that somehow turns this from a classic to a very good film. A good story can read better than it plays. I admire the fact that the film kept its integrity and didn't go for an audience pleasing sell-out, and yet and yet... Well worthwhile, this is a very tough and fine film executed with expertise in all departments.
B000002MZ6|4.0|Since I've been an ardent fan of this man's music since I first heard Tubular Bells in the mid eighties, I will never be able to provide an unbiased viewpoint- I am that much of a fan. With that being said, I found this piece of music exceptional. There have been some works by Oldfield that do not strike the chords others do, and there has yet to be something akin to the imaginative work of, say, Incantations or Hergest Ridge. Since our prayers to see those works matched in brilliance with anything since them have been unanswered all these years, we have to admit that all the work of Mike Oldfield is fitting of the man at the controls. I've seen harsh criticism of some of the works, but I have yet to hear the man produce music that doesn't place him among the greatest of all musicians in human history. 'Distant Earth' is really one of the better peices by Mr. Oldfield over the past twenty years or so, although I have yet to hear one I do not love. However, I had to let TBIII grow on me for a while. In short, if one appreciates the finest of today's ambitious music, then you will find this piece a treasure among your collection.

0143038419|1.0|Books in which a woman finds herself through a period of self-indulgence only work if the reader believes that the seeker deserves a period of self indulgence, or if the reader believes that the seeker has given and given and is truly depleted.      In this case we have a writer who perhaps needs a relaxing break to recover from divorce, but after she has recovered what she really needs is to think of others for a change. She would really have found a level of prayer at say, Mother Teresa's centers in India--plus, she would have had a chance to look beyond her own navel.
B000002MM8|4.0|I'm relatively new to Dead Can Dance's music. I have heard only a couple of their albums. I can't really say I became a massive DCD fan but I certainly have enjoyed their music from what little I have heard. I recently found a copy of INTO THE LABYRINTH at my library and decided to check it out. I am very glad that I did get the cd. I felt like I was in another world whenever I listen to the cd. The Middle Eastern influences certainly gives the music an international flair. The production is immaculate. I can hear every single word that comes floating out of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry's voices. There is also a live vibe. I almost feel as if I am in the recording studio watching the duo sing. While I do enjoy Brendan Perry's vocals, I have to admit I like Lisa's vocals a bit more. Her vocalizations often reminds me of one of my all time favorite sings, Loreena McKennitt. I liked most of INTO THE LABYRINTH. The only track I wasn't too keen on was \\"The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove\\". I didn't particularly care for the melody or Brendan's vocals. Overall, INTO THE LABYRINTH is a lush soundscape of Middle Eastern melodies suitable for listening after a long day at the office.
B000GRUMPU|4.0|The original \\"Poseidon Adventure\\" was loaded with action, soap opera, and totally unbelievable events. I'm still amused that middle-aged Shelley Winters had her high school breath-holding medal around her neck at a crucial moment. The new film is probably better, though it lacks serious character development. At the time of such a crisis, I doubt everyone will stop and talk about their lives, so it makes sense. CGI effects were Oscar nominated and Josh Lucas and Kurt Russell were fine, as well as Emmy Rossum. Jacinda Barrett overacted horribly, but the kid who played her son was excellent. I still don't know why the old super-epics need to be re-made, but in the hands of Wolfgang Peterson, this was better drama. Irwin Allen's original was more fun, if only for the schlock, and it's \\"original\\" idea from Paul Gallico, who also wrote \\"The Three Lives of Thomasina\\"..in the 30's. Re-imagining ideas will always be exciting to the Hollywood honchos. Do they realize that some original material might appeal to the public?
0143038583|1.0|Pollan frequently omits, denies or downplays important facts.      1) We will never determine the optimal diet is impossible but we can gain a better idea of what the optimal diet would be through science. (Yes this is inherently reductionist.)  2) That people make bad use of research is not the fault of the research.  3) Traditional food cultures are not optimal diets.  4) While the food industry does in some sense affect the food we eat, the food they produce is determined by individuals desire for inexpensive food that never goes stale and contains lots of sugar, fat and salt.  5) There is no evidence that many artificial foods are unhealthy.  6) Most people don't want to garden and there is no reason they should.  7) Pollan doesn't mention that animals are unnecessarily tortured in the production of our food.  8) Most, if not all, people could benefit from some kind of nutritional supplements.  9) The intelligent consumer now has the opportunity to eat healthier than people have ever eaten before  10) Ok, I admit it. If you don't know anything about nutrition Pollan's basic ideas will have you eating healthier than the typical American.
B00003CX97|5.0|I'm hoping someone might have information on this. I recently purchased the Limited Edition of the Bridge on the River Kwai and received it today. The film itself and the DVD extras are, of course, fantastic and appear quite comprehensive. The back of the case, however, also lists \\"Collectible Inserts: Insert features text of original souvenir book.\\" My purchase was new and sealed, but there is no collectible insert that I can see. In doing a little digging, many of the online reviews mention a 12-page booklet, which I'm assuming is this elusive insert that I appear to be missing. I wonder if anyone would happen to know if this booklet is no longer being included...as I know sometimes occurs...or if I simply received a copy that's missing the insert. Any information would be appeciated!
0743486285|4.0|This is a great book.  It will shock you, depress you, and make you laugh at times.  I liked the book \\"The Dirt\\" better, but this one does focus more on just the addiction that Nikki Sixx faced.  It is amazing that he kept a diary through the whole thing.  I am sure it helped him to remember things he normally never would have.  If you are a fan of him or Motley Crue this is a must read and it looks great with all the pics and drawings.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I am a huge Annie Lennox fan and love that magnificent, honey laced voice of hers. At its best it soars like and eagle and dives live a whale. I love the album, SOMD, and the standout tracks for me are: Dark Road, Smithereens which I think is tied for best song on the album, Through The Glass Darkly, Lost which is the second song tied for best on the album, Big Sky, and Fingernail Moon. I am still waiting for Annie to progress from this melancholy, heartbroken phase and experience the sunshine again. There was a time when her music was fun like, Right By Your Side and I Need a Man. I hope the next album has more upbeat and happier songs than the dark and sometimes depressing, which still sounds beautiful but it's becoming the predominant mood of her albums. Lighten up Annie!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The Suits Who Mind the Store at Twentieth Century Fox can never live down their hugely premature  cancellation of the infant series FIREFLY, the best written, most lovingly acted TV show ever created.  These baker's dozen episodes, however, bear repeat watching, even though it's hard to get past the frustration of never being able to see the development of many tantalizing plot seeds (enough to fuel many years of good drama) which Joss Whedon sowed in the brief time before the series was dumped. Buy this collection; perhaps increased revenues from the FIREFLY TV episodes will convince the idiots at Fox who cancelled the show to at least authorize a sequel to the SERENITY movie.
B00004XQ83|5.0|My husband and I enjoyed the movie sooo much and felt the soundtrack played a pivital role in that enjoyment.  We were right! I pop it in every A.M. during my commute to work.......and we listen to it at least once a week end.  If you liked the movie. get the soundtrack.
B000F9RB8A|4.0|This movie wasn't what I expected, it was much better.  Hilarious in parts and really cool in others, this movie keeps you interested and entertained till the very end. Excellent action-comedy.
B000ASSDVA|3.0|My wife and I lived in Spain for several months in the Spring of 2007 to attend the Loius Vuitton races prior to the America's Cup.  El Cid is a well known film over there especially amoung the folks our age who remember the implied love making scenes between Charlton Heston and Gina.  We traveled to Peniscola where the movie was filmed (it was not filmed in Valencia where the historical events were suposed to have happened) and toured the castle (built by the Templar Knights).  Had to have the movie when we returned.  It brought back great memories of both Spain and the first time we saw the movie many years ago.  Roger H. Strube, MD
B0008JIJ2E|3.0|This is a pretty good movie, which in essence tells the story of the kid who has sand kicked in his face, gets taught by a master and then fights the bullies in a Karate tournament.<br /><br />The fight scenes are well done and Pat Morita (now sadly deceased) as Mr Miyagi steals every scene he is in. His training of the kid takes unusual forms, such as cleaning the cars, painting the house etc. The moment of revelation for Daniel is a great scene, when he realises that all this seemingly meaningless work serves its purpose in mastering a martial art.<br /><br />This is a movie with a few little morality tales. On the downside sadly, sometimes these messages are a little to obviously waved in front your face. Another aspect of the film that I found very irratating was the 1980's pop songs (not the original score which was fine). I was never a fan of 1980's pop in the 80's, even less so now, and worse still the songs concerned were really only played to lyrically re-enforce an already obvious point in the film.<br /><br />However, overall this is an entertaining, if flawed film, that is worth getting if you can pick it up cheap.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Fantastically funny! From beginning to end its fast moving, hilarious and delightful. George Clooney doesn't hurt  either! We watch it constantly  and still see things we didn't see before.......

B000UCEJEQ|5.0|That line is from Bob Dylan's song &#34;Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues&#34;.  I thought it was appropriate because I am truly grateful to Annie Lennox for the passion and attitude she has created in the recording studio for the last 25 years, both as one of The Eurythmics and as a solo artist, accent on the word &#34;artist&#34;.  This time around, Annie presents us with a mixture of confessional ballads and harder, dancier tracks, all written by the Lady herself.<br /><br />&#34;Dark Road&#34; starts out pretty bland but has a strong mid-section reminiscent of Eurythmics music.  Likewise, &#34;Smithereens&#34; thankfully grows in strength as the song progresses.  &#34;Through the Glass Darkly&#34; and &#34;Lost&#34; are ballads that lean toward the dark side musically.  Unfortunately, one of the ballads is the least successful track;  &#34;Fingernail Moon&#34; despite being a pretty song with the usual good, creative arrangement, seems to be a strain on Annie's voice.<br /><br />OK, I admit that I prefer the up-tempo tracks.  &#34;Love Is Blind&#34; sounds like it could have been lifted straight from the &#34;Touch&#34; album.  &#34;Ghosts In My Machine&#34; rocks like &#34;Missionary Man&#34; right from the start.  &#34;Womankind&#34;, a driving dance track, reminds me of &#34;Take Me to the River&#34; from &#34;Medusa&#34;, and &#34;Big Sky&#34; sounds like a dramatic R&B song Annie-style, again like the ones on &#34;Medusa&#34;.  &#34;Coloured Bedspread&#34; is one of the best, with interesting lyrics and tight, hard dance music.  And &#34;Sing&#34; is another synth-dance cut, accompanied by prominent piano which reminds me of 90's Club music. To sum it all up, Annie once again has released a classy, well-produced work that we should all appreciate in this time of scarce good music.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Groundhog Day is Bill Murray's best film by some distance. It's a romantic comedy in disguise. However unlike a lot of romantic comedies it doesn't leave me wanting to throw-up in a bucket. Bill Murray plays Phil Conners a TV Weatherman man destined to re-live the same day over and over, and from the way it is depicted in the film, this happens literally thousands of times. Sent to cover the Groundhog Day festivities in Punxsutawney the very cynical Phil can't believe it when he wakes the next morning to find its Groundhog Day again.....<br /><br />Many of the characters will live on with you after you have seen the film. Perhaps best of all is Ned Ryerson (brilliantly played by Stephen Tobolowsky) who Phil Conners meets every day over and over. He was someone Phil new at school, but now he's the Insurance salesman from hell. This a very funny film, I saw it at the Cinema two or three times and have enjoyed it every time since. There hasn't been a better comedy since it was made. For that matter I can't think of many better before it was made.<br /><br />The supporting cast are all good, and the extras on the DVD include a directors commentary, documentary as well as the usual trailers etc.
B000UJBYD8|1.0|every time the cult releases a new album i have high hopes. i've been let down more times than not.     but when they release something good, it's really GOOD! (love, electric, self titled)    i realize they're like most rock groups of my era that aren't getting any younger and don't have the creative drive they once had, but to put out something this bad will do nothing but tarnish their legacy.    you'd think they'd learn from their past mistakes, (ceremony, sonic temple, etc.)    all that said, this album sucks!    the first song, \\"born into this\\" starts off with a pretty cool guitar riff but the singer just ruins the song with horrible lyrics! the second song, \\"citizens\\" is equally bad...    i'm getting depressed just thinking of these songs so i'll sum up this review by saying that i only found two songs on the whole mess listenable!    buyer beware!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I didn't realize how much I missed Bruce until I listened to this. The E Street Band sounds terrific and Bruce's voice is the best it's been in 20+ years. If you love The River, buy this now.
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|Batman Begins is the best Batman film made to date. Easily eclipsing the many previous versions. Christian Bale is as always excellent in the leading role and he is supported by a first-rate cast including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman.<br /><br />The film starts by covering his early years as he travels the globe studying different types of criminal and the ways in which he can fight them. The culmination of this is the training in the temple with Ducard (Lima Neeson). This is a marvellously well done sequence and probably the highpoint of the film. Its also in this sequence that you will realise that the film is really not for young children (it has a 12 rating anyway). There are disturbing images and sequences in this film.<br /><br />At a little over two hours, the film does remarkably well in holding your interest, and it is only in the last section of the film that it lets itself down at all. The ending was a little too blockbuster oriented for my liking and slightly out of place with the brilliance of the rest of the film. Don't let this put you off though, because overall, and taking into account the extras disc, this is well worth getting.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Is that this is one of my favorite all time Disney Cartoons Movies but I've noticed that the restored characters (even on the box) don't look the same as the originals (so that's why I might buy one of each). Just because of the rawness look of the original drawings.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This classic album from 1971 is one of Bowie's very best albums. It was largely forgotten with the success of Ziggy Stardust, but unlike that later fantasy themed album, this album references some of Bowie's idols and contains as many classic tracks as Ziggy.<br /><br />Take three out of the first four tracks: 'Changes', 'Oh! You Pretty Things' and 'Life on Mars'. Has there been a stronger start to album than that? There is brilliant song-writing both lyrically and musically on little known songs like 'Song for Bob Dylan'. Bowie describes Dylan as \\"with a voice like sand and glue\\" then later that he \\"put the fear in a whole lot more\\".<br /><br />Musically this is basically the Ziggy Stardust band but with the oddball extra of Rick Wakeman on Piano. This album was recorded a year or two before Rick Wakeman started his own successful career, and if you've been listening to this album as long as I have you can't imagine it without the Piano. Wakeman's Piano is most prominent on 'Fill your Heart\\" which is the only song Bowie didn't write.<br /><br />As with most Bowie albums this is a marvellously perverse mixture. Take 'Quicksand' for example, this has a wonderfully catchy chorus but the lyrics are all about getting closer to death - \\"knowledge comes with deaths release\\".<br /><br />The remaster is excellent and the album sounds as good as I've ever heard it. A must have for any serious rock music collection.
0156027321|3.0|This book plays on the reader's gullibility.  I was willing to believe up to the man eating island.  Then I just got upset.  Is this book supposed to help me find God or is it supposed to prove that I am gullible enough to believe in a \\"better\\" story?  Where do you find 16 year old boys who spend pages philosophizing on tigers while their own life is in great danger?  The Boy Scout in my enjoyed the survival story of Pi, but the amazement of survival becomes overshadowed by things that don't add up.  It made me lose sight of the meaning of the story.  Then part 3 comes along and I am more confused about which of two unbelievable stories I am supposed to believe.  It reminds me of Jesus' parables where even his direct reports couldn't understand.  It leaves me asking \\"Why?\\".  Why don't you just give me a story that clearly supports your point?
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This is the best new James Bond film I've seen for a long time. The pre-credits sequence is very good, and its a shame they didn't maintain some of that style in the main film. This is Bonds last mission before he gets his double O status.<br /><br />Daniel Craig does bring something new to Bond. He is mean and ruthless, but underneath there is still a heart in there. The plot is simple, leading to a very high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale, which was one of the best scenes in the film for me - quite mesmerising. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre made a worthy opponent to Craigs Bond, both at the Poker table and as a torturer. This latter sequence is extremly unpleasant and certainly not for youngsters. Judi Dench played M again and although it was only a small part she was, as always very good.<br /><br />The film isn't perfect though, their are a few sequences (such as at the airport and the sinking house at the end) which are typical Hollywood blockbuster stuff and unneccessary. The film is also a little to long. They could have chopped 10 or 15 minutes, ideally from the above scenes, and it would have been a much better film.<br /><br />Overall though this is well worth seeing. The extras on the two disc edition are well worth watching. They include an interesting documentary about the various Bond Girls throughout the history of James Bond films and a documentary about the making of the film.
1594489505|3.0|This book just didn't hit me like Kite Runner, but I still found myself very emotional during the whole book.  I think part of it could have been that this was taken from a female perspective and, I am happy to say that, I just don't have that perspective.  I know I gave it a low rating but that is only because I had to compare it to Kite Runner.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, especially women, but I did not come out with a desire to fly a kite or treat my friends nicer.  There were just fewer connections here.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|I've never seen the TV show so had no expectations in that direction. However I have seen most of Michael Mann's films and so was expecting quite a lot from one of the most consistently good directors working in Hollywood today. In some areas he succeeds and the high standards he set with 'Manhunter' and 'Heat' are maintained: Great cinematography and couple of brilliant set pieces being the films strong points.<br /><br />The plot is a simple drug bust, with the complication that Crockett (Farrell) gets involved with the drug lords girlfriend. It would have got 3 and 1/2 stars from me but it fails to deliver in a number of other areas so I couldn't give it 4. Firstly the plot has a number of gaping holes in it (see previous reviews for details). Secondly a fair chunk of the dialogue is mumbled badly which is very frustrating. So this isn't anywhere near as good as Heat (not that much is), but it could have been much worse if another director had done a formulaic Hollywood job on it. Overall it is an entertaining film with a pretty good cast.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|This film deserves 10 stars! I loved it so much! I will reserve final judgement until I see it again but after one viewing I think it is my favorite Pixar film yet! It was just absolutely brilliant in every way!<br /><br />Unfortunately, this DVD release is very lacking. I miss the double-disk versions Pixar used to come out with. And where's the Brad Bird commentary?<br /><br />I have a feeling we will be double-dipped into a 2-disk version in the not-so-distant future, or that Disney is selling out to BlueRay and are thus saving all the good stuff for that. Sad.<br /><br />Since Amazon hasn't listed the extras I thought I would help them out.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />* The Pixar short that appeared with the film in theaters, \\"Lifted,\\" in which a novice alien pilot tries to abduct a sleeping human<br />* Some deleted scenes, with introductions by screenwriter and director Brad Bird.<br />* A second animated short, \\"Your Friend the Rat,\\" starring Remy and his brother, Emile.<br />* \\"Fine Food and Film: A Conversation with Brad Bird and Thomas Keller,\\" a featurette with the California celebrity chef who served as a consultant to the film.
B000URDEB0|5.0|People will complain for a long time to come that Anette is not Tarja, and to some this will force the album review's down a notch, or make a die-hard Tarja fan vote 0 or 1. It's to these last group of people I say: one member does not make a band. Tarja had a great voice, don't get me wrong, but it's still Nightwish regardless. Anette does sounds more like Amy Lee (of Evanescence) than Nightwish of yore, but she still has the talent one would expect of Night. Had the band chosen another operatic vocalist, I believe they would have been bashed for not being as good as Tarja. There's no reason to spell the death of the \\"once great\\" Nightwish with Tarja's departure. I    That aside, I won't go into trying to describe the music because I'm no good at that, but I will say this is the one album I have been looking for: almost every song has something truly epic about it, the music soars and rises above the speakers it's playing through. The production is exquisite; there's no distortion in even the last track (amazing given the content), which is something you can't give to most mainstream American-produced discs, unfortunately. Most expensive Finnish recording indeed.    I'm going to see Nightwish live in a few weeks, so let's hope Anette does as well on the new album as she does on the old material. All that said, I would be neither surprised nor outraged should Tarja ever return to the band.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Have not seen this movie Tron in years and the special effects still are great.  Disney knew how to catch your imagination. I would love to see what new computer inmaging would do in a updated remake. Still worth the money.[[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)]]
B000UO338W|3.0|For a band that went through one of the most dramatic musical developments during the 1980's, from the electronic pop of [[ASIN:B000002VBZ With Sympathy]] and early singles to the aggressive metal/industrial attack of their peak late 80's/early 90's classic albums, Ministry has stood still for the most part of the past 10 - 15 years. It seems that nowadays Ministry records are more distinguished from one another by speed rather than sound (contrast this CD to the slow-motion sludge of [[ASIN:B000002MW9 Filth Pig]] and [[ASIN:B00000J7J9 The Dark Side of the Spoon]]).  The band started turning back around for the better with [[ASIN:B000294SFC Houses of the Mole']] and [[ASIN:B000F3AAZW Rio Grande Blood]]. The Last Sucker is the final entry in this trilogy of albums that Al Jourgensen and Co. has devoted to the madness of the current Bush administration.     I was initially disappointed to learn that The Last Sucker was also to be the last Ministry album of their career, however after hearing this CD I am now of the opinion that putting the band to rest is a good idea.       Despite it's infectious energy and barbed political attacks The Last Sucker sounds a bit tired. The musical hooks and choruses don't sink in as strong this time around, as if the best were used for the previous two albums.  The cover of \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" (I was never a big Doors fan to begin with) and the song about the VP's hunting misadventures are the two most notable missteps. Most everything else falls in a take-it-or-leave-it category.     Not that Last Sucker isn't worthwhile, if this is your first Ministry purchase then add a star to my review (although I  would recommend Rio Grande Blood or [[ASIN:B000002LR6 Psalm 69]] first). For this longtime Ministry fan I would rather have the band end this way, with a trio of inspired, focused works.    FINAL RATING: 3 out of 5 stars  Favorite tracks: \\"Let's Go\\", \\"Watch Yourself\\", \\"End of Days\\"
B000VDDWE2|5.0|Fox has really done a good job encoding The Day After Tomorrow.  The AVC encoded video really shines and is much better than the VC-1 codec that WB uses.  The sound is off the charts as well for this title. If you are looking to get into Blu-ray, this is definitely the demo disc you need to use.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Great album but not better than the two others!! Flashing lights, homecoming, Champion ,Good life are very Good.Congratulations for him.This is a real G.O.O.D music.   Peace from France
B000JJS8TM|5.0|There are quite a few negative reviews here by people who obviously do not know what an audio-DVD is.  This is meant to be played on a surround sound home theater system.  This is not a video.  Also, playing this on a 2-channel (left/right) stereo completely defeats the purpose.
0375842381|5.0|When \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy was complete, I told my daughters that I wished they would make a movie of this trilogy.  Each book gets better, and the last one in the series brought tears on more than one occasion.  It is an absolutely wonderful read -- read all three books to my daughters, starting with the Golden Compass when they were 8 and 11. Some parents may think too much violence.
3551354014|5.0|A great book if you're learning German (like me) and want to try your hand at some pleasure reading. Most books in second hand shops that are printed in German (at least, the ones near me) only  have books by authors that I've never heard of, or who are a dime-a-dozen. Maybe I'm biased because I've loved the Potter series from its beginning, but I would definitely recommend this book.
B000UJBYD8|4.0|I expected to be very disappointed by this album.  Another literary reference for a title, from a Bukowski poem and Nietzsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" for the last album.  (Ian, we get it , you read).   Then, the first time I heard \\"Dirty Little Rockstar\\" it sounded like The Cult covering INXS covering the Stones, \\"Undercover of the Night\\".      Nonetheless, I\\"m converted.      \\"I Assassin\\" and \\"Illuminated\\" instantly caught my attention and all but 2 of the other songs are rapidly growing on me.  Granted, there are no riffs or solos that are gonna make any guitar players envious, but the album still stands on its own merits.  I think the comparisons to \\"Love\\" and \\"Electric\\" are overblown.  \\"Born Into This\\" sounds more like their under-rated, self-titled album with a few throwbacks to \\"Love\\".  That's good enough for me.    Now if Ian would just lose the bandana and work the crowd when they tour.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I honestly cannot think of a song on this album that I do not like. The lyrics are poignant, the instrumental aspect is just wonderful....best songs are probably \\"Cannonball\\", \\"Amie\\", and the haunting track \\"the Blower's Daughter\\". If you can't afford the album, at least download those three.
0316067598|5.0|This is a stunning account of an amazing story. Marcus Luttrell gives a you an inside look at the Navy Seals and what it takes to be one.   This book also gives illustrations of the idiocy that politicians impose on the soldiers they send off to war.  Marcus's accounts of the battles fought and the heroism displayed by him and his fellow Navy Seals are truly mind blowing. This story has given me a tremendous respect for Marcus Luttrell, and all navy Seals, and given me hope that there are still real men in America.  This is a must read!
0316067598|5.0|This is an outstanding book and one that should be read before the next election.  It is a tour de force of the Navy Seals.  The heartbreak is that we take the best and the brightest, put them through the most brutal training, and then tie their hands in the most difficult of situations.
0061367036|5.0|Definately a must have book for all Supernatural fans.  It explains all the myths that were the bases of the episodes in season one.  Also, it is written in the Brothers point of view making it interesting to read.  Highly Recommended
B0000VCZK2|4.0|I purchased this set over three years ago and I never had a problem with it. Then again, I sold it because I never really watched the films. Ive been watching more movies lately and gave this set anther go round. Plus I have a surround sound, so that should be fun. Its probably the greatest box set ever because of the contents. While some movie box sets are good they always seem to forget something. Whether it be a movie because it wasnt made at the studio or extra features, there is always something missing. This set has nothing missing. All four films plus four director cut versions of the films and extra features that i'll probably never see it all in my life. Its a good boxset and it has never been duplicated. I wonder why.
B00003CXIP|5.0|A great cast of young stars.  Another great King movie.  I love this movie because it reminds me of my sons at this age.  Curious and adventurous.
B000URDEB0|5.0|To start off all the rabid annette haters really do need to chill out. Yes she's not Tarja and yes Nightwish sounds different. But the differences between this and previous albums is in my mind all good. From start to finish an excellent showing by the crew and far superior integration of the orchestral aspects of the songs.     \\"The Poet and the Pendulum\\" starts the album off with a nice solid tone and \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\"  follows up with something a little heavier (just a note to the tarja fans who haven't picked up on this, read the lyrics and the commentary on it, this song isn't as angry/agressive towards tarja as most think). The album continues nicely from there until Nighwish pulls the rug out from under us with \\"The Islander\\" and \\"Last of the Wilds\\" and while it's a bit of a shocking change the celtic influences on both songs made me a very happy irishman. This followed up with \\"7 Days till the Wolves\\" which is not only a good song but show cases an excellent duet between Annette and Marco.    All in all full marks for Dark Passion Play and I will now eagerly await the tour to swing my way and the next album from Nightwish
0316067598|3.0|Too much bloviating in the beginning of the book. I'm in the military and wanted to read his story. The story of being on the mountain through the time he was rescued was pretty hair-raising though and that was the meat of the book. The author could have done without the first 4-5 chapters and telling us about SEAL training etc.
B00062RCBW|5.0|I was tired of buying collector's sets and downloading random episodes. THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY. Excellent picture even stretched on widescreen TV. Seasons three and four kick @$$. Make it so baby!!!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|I bought this latest studio release from Rush with great anticipation.  Had the reviews been largely negative, I still would have purchased it.  Rush has been my favorite group since the early 80s.  I own 16 studio albums and one live album, plus four DVDs of live shows.    Some overall comments about the album first.  Thirteen tracks and over an hour of music is good value for the money, so long as the album is good.  I had to play through Snakes and Arrows a few times before I really began to appreciate it.  My first listen was disappointing.  Never make a rash or rush judgment about Rush is my motto.  Still, there isn't a single track that jumps out as an instant classic, and the overall beat is mid to slow tempo.  Seven of the tracks are longer than 5 minutes, giving the overall impression of a slow album.  If I were to make one CD of the very best of Rush, none of those tracks would come from Snakes and Arrows.  Lastly, I think three instrumental tracks is a bit much, but with 13 total tracks that isn't too bad.  Still, the overall album is worth four stars in my opinion and is a good showing for a group who has been around for so long and still has lots of legs left.    Track 1 - Far Cry - 9.5/10 - Only Rush can get away with the opening line, \\"Pariah dogs and wandering madmen.\\"  This is the strongest track on the album.    Track 2 - Armor and Sword - 7/10 - This isn't a bad track but it isn't great either.  It has grown on me a bit and perhaps giving it a 7 is too low.  The six and a half minutes make it drag a bit, and support the overall feeling about this album in general, a bit too slow and methodical.    Track 3 - Workin' Them Angels - 8.5/10 - Only Rush can get away with a song that has three different tempos.  At first I just couldn't get into this track, but it has grown on me.    Track 4 - The Larger Bowl - 7/10 - Depressing song in an album filled with depressing songs.  Still, this one is much more in your face with it.    Track 5 - Spindrift - 9/10 - Great tragic sounding music, probably my second favorite track.    Track 6 - The Main Monkey Business - 7/10 - Nice instrumental piece, but six minutes of not great or particularly catchy music either.    Track 7 - The Way the Wind Blows - 9/10 - Another six and a half minute song which begins slowly, has a bluesy feel, yet gets going and ultimately is a great track (2 minutes just to the first chorus/refrain).  My second or third favorite song on the album.  Perhaps also the prettiest track in terms of melody.    Track 8 - Hope - 7.5/10 - Nice guitar solo by Alex's son, Lerxst.  Fine work, just isn't a fantastic piece.    Track 9 - Faithless - 7.5/10 - \\"A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky.\\"  Perhaps a bit arrogant this song when seen from the perspective of someone who has a living, vibrant faith in God.  \\"And I believe in love, and that's faith enough for me\\" is probably the lamest line to come from Rush.  Not a bad track overall, but a bit hollow and shallow lyrically.  It seems they are only able to look at the negative side of faith, while discounting the incredible people throughout human history who have done great things driven by their faith in their Creator.    Track 10 - Bravest Face - 7.5/10 - These guys aren't poor and living in the gutter, yet at times that is the impression you get from the lyrics.  Is there nothing good at all about religion and faith?  Apparently not.  They have such a narrow view which is disappointing, and one wonders why suicide isn't the best option with such a pathetic, philosophical point of view.    Track 11 - Good News First - 4/10 - Begins with a nice guitar riff and has promise, but dies with Getty's meandering, irritating voice.  By far the weakest track on the album and one I now skip entirely.    Track 12 - Malignant Narcissism - 8.5/10 - Best instrumental track of the three.  Good beat, gets the job done quickly, nice, tight little piece of music.    Track 13 - We Hold On - 8.5/10 - A good track to end the album, moves quicker than most tracks, has a cool sound.    Lastly, a general comment about the religious aspect of this album.  Being a committed Christian, at times I have to swallow hard about Rush's negative religious views.  Still, Freewill is my all-time favorite Rush song, and I don't mind clever lyrics and wonderful instruments even if I don't agree with the band's perspective.  I don't mind insights from those who deride the faithful, and who rightly point out weaknesses in religion (\\"Pray and pass the ammunition\\" is a great line).  And yet, it is a pity.  God has given these guys incredible talents, opportunities, and I am sure a very comfortable living.  And now in their 50s, they really are bitter, old men, who in essence do nothing more than spit in God's face.  That's a real shame.  But I'll buy their next studio album without question!  And if there were a live concert that only played the tracks from Snakes and Arrows, I'd shell out good bucks to see it.  These guys are incredible artists, and I hope that one day they come around to recognize the spiritual realities all around them.
B000UFAURI|3.0|With their sixth studio album, think both discs of \\"In Your Honor\\" mashed into one 12 song disc and you have \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\\" (ESPG). Gil Norton, who helped the Foos make their finest work \\"The Colour And The Shape\\", unfortunately does not work his magic a second time out. That's not to say that there are no good songs here. There are some memorable alt.rock songs like the first single \\"The Pretender\\", but also \\"Erase/Replace\\", \\"Long Road To Ruin\\" and \\"Cheer Up, Boys (Your Make Up Is Running)\\". There are some partially acoustic numbers that work fairly well like \\"Stranger Things Have Happened\\", the instrumental \\"Ballad Of The Beaconsfield Miners\\", \\"Statues\\" and \\"Home\\".<br /><br />In general, \\"ESPG\\" felt tired to me. Not as good as their earlier work, even the first disc of \\"In Your Honor\\". The trouble is I am biased in favor of the Foos. I like all six of their albums, it's just that Dave and company didn't really stretch themselves this time. They played it safe, right down to obtaining their former hit producer Gil Norton. Three and a half stars is my vote. The band really needs to try something different next time. Surprise us.
1401307787|5.0|If you are interested in spirituality and/or meditation and are looking for a book that is both deep and clear, this is the book to read. You will find that the book is worth several book on the same subject by other people -- and it does it in an articulate, elevated, succint, no-fluff manner that will impress the heck out of you as few books ever will. I must ad a warning, more about the subject matter than about the book per se: Not everyone is ready to assimilate its contents (or any other equally serious meditation book's content, for that matter). The saying that you have to be ready for something in order to understand it applies very much in this case. I can imagine that it could be taken as  too ethereal by some people -- those who are not ready. You would need to have lived and realized that there are matters of the soul that you need to take care of to receive its message. But if you are genuinely thirsty about spiritual matters: order it right away! This makes what we normally take as \\"Eastern\\" concepts accessible to an educated Western mind, and you realize that there is no need to think of it as Eastern or buddhist or use any label at all. I am really thankful for this book. You will be too.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|One of the best albums I've listened to for a while.  Great relaxed, background music.
159102594X|5.0|I wasn't really expecting much when i picked up this book, because the description sounded rather mundane. It talked about the characters, a mage a swordsman, a barbarian, a whatever, and a something else. I was bored with nothing to read so I picked it up anyway. Very good descision, let me tell ya.     The characters in this book are not just original, but almost lifelike. The way they are revealed is unique too. Often it's done in italics to represent the character's thoughts, but those thoughts often comment on or respond to the normal narration. It hard to describe but very entertaining to read. Its like that movie \\"Stranger than Fiction\\", the characters are almost talking back to the author at times.    My favorite was Logan the barbarian, who's full of a brutish sort of wisdom and always surprises you with exceptionally good decisions for a barbarian.    The plot is interesting as well, though thats not what kept me reading, I just wanted to find out more about the characters. Still do. I can't wait for the sequel.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|I am in love.<br /><br />Last night, as I typed away at my memoir, I listened to the long awaited new album by Annie Lennox.<br /><br />I have been a long time fan of her work. My first introduction to her was the Eurhythmics but I fell in lust with her when she started her solo career and I have been in love with her ever since.<br /><br />Contrary to most people, I loved her last album Bare. I felt it was a gorgeous piece of musical art and it touched me, moved me and made me feel. What more could you ask for from music?<br /><br />And then, silence. For four years there has been nothing from this Diva of music. Therefore, I was caught off guard when I was in HMV the other day and saw a new album by her: Songs of Mass Destruction.<br /><br />I was floored! I couldn't be that out of touch with the music scene could I? How could I not know that she had a new album out? When did this happen? Why was I the last to know?<br /><br />I had to get it. I couldn't afford it, but I got it anyway. I am so very glad I did.<br /><br />It is a beautiful, moving album. Much lighter than the very introspective and private Bare, Songs of Mass Destruction is an incredibly medley of sound, emotion and feeling. As I typed away at my memoir, I found myself stopping, fingers still on the keyboard, the lyrics washing over me.<br /><br />I have several favorites on the album: Dark Road, Fingernail Moon, Ghosts in My Machine, Sing. Really, I love the entire album. As always, though, there is one song that sticks out for me. One song that becomes an anthem for me of sorts.<br /><br />That song is Smithereens.<br /><br />I'm going through a particularly difficult time with a family member and this song, these words, just spoke to me.<br /><br />How is it she seems to know exactly what to say? How is it she can see into my life? This is the true power of music, I think. The power to make you feel, the power to make you remember, the power to connect to something within you and within your life.<br /><br />I know that I'll be listening to this album all weekend. Why not do the same? Do yourself a favor and pick up the album.<br /><br />And just let yourself listen...e same? Do yourself a favor and pick up the album.     And just let yourself listen...
B0000041XX|5.0|I purchased this CD as a gift for my mother after Pavarotti died.  She talked it about how it was her absolute favorite of all the 3 Tenor CD's.  She was overjoyed to get it and plays it almost every day.  It is a wonderful CD for those that love tenors and Pavarotti.
B000TLMWLK|5.0|I highly recommend watching this DVD. It brings back so many great memories, but even for people who don't remember the TV show, it gives you a real feel for the mood of the country at the time. The guests and music are great, and the hairstyles and clothing are a hoot.
B000LC3ID8|1.0|The first film was original and well done. All you needed was the two people, and the background story. Saw 2, 3, and now 4 (you wished the game was over.) do nothing more than make money from general movie goers who like to be told what to like. save your money and buy toilet paper, its the same thing.

B000002UZ4|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys show their talent on this very good, solid CD retrospective. It's full of their hits and great music.<br /><br />\\"West End Girls\\" begins this track set; they sing of the young women in London's West End district who meet \\"East End Boys;\\" and the musical arrangement makes good use of the strings, drums and percussion. Great! \\"It's A Sin\\" makes a dramatic arrangement out of the strings, female backup chorus, special sound effects to simulate thunder, drums and percussion. The Pet Shop Boys do this number to express a man's guilt just because he was gay. The music and vocals compliment each other perfection and \\"It's A Sin\\" remains a strong number even today.<br /><br />\\"What Have I Done To Deserve This?\\" was a big mainstream hit for The Pet Shop Boys; the drums, percussion, keyboard and guitars carry the melody very well. \\"What Have I Done To Deserve This?\\" explores the frustration a man feels when he could not please his former materialistic lover no matter how much he gave to them. Good harmonizing, too! \\"Domino Dancing\\" features a great dance music beat; and \\"Left To My Own Devices\\" was to be another major mainstream hit for The Pet Shop Boys. \\"Left To My Own Devices\\" sports an excellent dance music beat with just a twist of disco flavoring to make this shine! This number lets The Pet Shop Boys sing of a man who wants to do as he pleases. I predict that you'll enjoy \\"Left To My Own Devices\\" very much.<br /><br />\\"Where The Streets Have No Name (I Can't Take My Eyes Off You)\\" begins with some pretty funky special effects; and when the musicians come in this number takes off like a rocket! Again we hear a type of dance music with a twist of disco flavoring to enhance the beauty of this number. In addition, \\"Was It Worth It?\\" features a great arrangement and The Pet Shop Boys deliver this number like the pros that they remain! Good backup vocals, too.<br /><br />The liner notes include some great artwork and we get the song credits also.<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys gave us so much; and it's wonderful that they shared this music with us. Hopefully they'll continue to entertain people for many years to come.t's wonderful that they shared this music with us. Hopefully they'll continue to entertain people for many years to come.
B000N3SRRC|3.0|I have followed Clutch for awhile and this is one of there better albums.  Not as heavy more bluesy but I would rate it over Pure Rock Fury.
B00006GFAB|5.0|KISS created awesome rock and roll music during the 1970s and beyond; this album proves it. Their sound appeals to many and their CDs still sell rather well today.<br /><br />The track set offers many hits. \\"Strutter\\" has great electric guitar and drums for starters; and they perform this number to perfection! \\"Strutter\\" explores the experience a man has with a woman who looks attractive but who isn't exactly all that nice. \\"Got To Choose\\" also has that great electric guitar from the start and the guitars, drums and percussion carry the bulk of the melody. \\"Got To Choose\\" rocks hard as the song explores the story of a lady who has to choose between two men.<br /><br />We get a fantastic live cut of \\"Rock And Roll All Night,\\" which was easily one of KISS's greatest hits. They play and sing flawlessly and the tune rocks hard; this is only fitting as the song is about people who want to party all the time! \\"Rock And Roll All Night\\" encourages people to celebrate life by partying and having a good time--can't fight them on that score! Great electric guitar, too.<br /><br />\\"Beth\\" is a much softer love ballad about a lonely man who wants a woman he can't have--at least for now. The strings, piano and backup vocals enhance the natural beauty of \\"Beth.\\" I predict that you will like \\"Beth\\" very much. \\"Calling Dr. Love\\" runs along the same lines as \\"Beth,\\" only for \\"Calling Dr. Love\\" they rock hard and now it's the man's turn to be the one pursued by the woman. \\"Calling Dr. Love\\" is one hit tune!<br /><br />\\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" rocks hard from the start with great electric guitar, backup vocals, drums and percussion. They harmonize to perfection and nobody misses a note on \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You.\\" I especially like the chorus on \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You.\\" In addition, \\"Forever\\" features some more great guitar and this great song deals with a love affair.<br /><br />The liner notes give us the song credits and the artwork impresses me.<br /><br />KISS gave us some of the best rock from the 1970s; and their more recent music is pretty remarkable, too. I highly recommend this album for new fans of KISS or casual KISS fans. Diehard KISS fans will already have the tracks on this CD; and I would encourage them to look for a more complete retrospective instead of this one.<br /><br />Great job, guys!

B000002U9K|5.0|I had a better review typed up and sent to amazon.  But for some reason that system didnt take it.  I will make this one short and sweet by saying that \\"Please\\" is an excellent debut from PSB.  Especially \\"West End Girls\\", \\"Tonight Is Forver\\" and \\"I Want A Lover\\" (they have an awesome message) being that they are looking someone just like other people a guy but still someone to be with and love as well.<br /><br />It is great to see a band being able to stay in the music business for so long and is a testament to how great they are and how they make music not only for us but for themselves as well and they had loads of fun doing it.  An all around excellent debut disc from Pet Shop Boys and is just one of many in a long and encompassing career that continues til this very day.<br /><br />I will be buying more from the guys in the future, no doubt about it. They represent a time when pop music was just getting started and are an excellent example of what it means to stay true what you do and enjoy it while you can.<br /><br />Love Please and anything that they have to offer as well.

One says to the other:    `If there is no God, how come: 1) The temperature in here is just right; 2) Food arrives regularly; 3) The water gets cleaned?     The second goldilocksfish (who happens to be a Professor for the Goldilocksfish Understanding Of Science) replies:    ` It is probable that we live in a multiverse that contains an astronomically large number of fish-bowls. Most of those bowls will be completely lifeless. The fact that we are here able to discuss the matter means that we are fortunate to live in one of the tiny number of bowls capable of sustaining evolved life. In the words of the old song: We' re here because we' re here, because we're here! `     {NB If you don't see the relevance, of the story above, to Dawkins' book, then I suggest you re-read pages 169-180 of The God Delusion.}

0684859106|3.0|I bought this bakebook for the vanilla cupcakes with vanilla icing, just as they sell at Magnolia.  Everytime I'm in the city I like to stop at Magnolia (or my new recent favorite cupcake eatery Buttercup)and eat a delicious treat.  However, these cupcakes are definitely not the \\"real deal.\\"  The recipes require tweaking. The cupcakes are too dry when made according to recipe.  The icing, had I used all of the sugar the recipe called for, would be cavity rot on a cupcake.  I used 1/2 the sugar that the recipe called for and found that to be the perfect amount for the perfect icing.  For these reasons, I am giving it 3 stars.  It's good, but not quite perfect.

1582701709|1.0|I personally did not care for this book and feel like I wasted my $.
0743486285|3.0|When I first started reading this book, I was shocked by his honesty and I was amazed at how easily he talked about his drug use. His life was the typical sex and drugs and rock and roll, yet to actually read the specifics of what actually happened was pretty satisfying, especially the times where he actually died and was brought back to life. It was a delightful car crash I could not look away from. Once in awhile there was tid bits about other rock stars too which was also interesting. Unfortunately, I was disappointed once I got about half way through the book. The one problem I had was the book is laid out with three different color types, black white and red, on dramatic layouts. This got to be hard on the eyes. Additionally by this point, the experiences were pretty redundant and reading about a junkie getting f-ed up constantly got pretty pathetic. The book chronicles a year in his life, where he is uber famous and on tour and for most of the book there seems to be a nod that this year is his rock bottom and at the end he may turn him self around. That pay off never comes. In fact there is a sloppy addendum at the end where he lists things that happened after that year until the present, like times where he is in and out of re-hab, his music comes in and out of popularity and his relationships with people work and also break up. It's as if once the book was done he wanted to show that he wasn't just some rock star junkie.  If you are a fan definitely read it and ignore the awkward style in which it was put together. If you are not a fan, I would read it casually and skip around to anything I found interesting.

0201626632|3.0|Overall, I did not find this book to be helpful upon reading it. The vast majority of the advice is either obvious or something you already know by the time you become aware of and purchase this book. Who doesn't know that working long hours and refraining from having children is one of the best ways to succeed in science? Who doesn't know that having a good mentor is an invaluable asset, but not guaranteed to happen because we as scientists receive no training in how to be good mentors?    On the positive side, if you read the anecdotes and success/failure stories that constitute a significant fraction of the book, there is a lot to be learned. Some provide hope because they remind you that others have successfully overcome the same challenges you have faced. Others reinforce the often overlooked point that, while having a supportive mentor is beneficial, we are in a career where being your own best advocate is a must. Taking the anecdotal stories as advice on how to best represent yourself and prepare for your career can make this a useful read. That having been said, the value of the advice tapers off the later in your career you read it.
0060797509|5.0|My six year old daughter and I are reading this book together. Building her attention was easier than I thought, with this book. After the first five pages she wanted to keep reading. Eighteen pages later she was dying to draw a picture of what had happened. This book really reminds me of what the purpose of families are all about. Every page describes what \\"Ma\\" or \\"Pa\\" was doing to take care of the family. The daughters found joy in every simple, hard or enduring task that had to be undertaken to produce a family of early American prairie days. This book uses simple words and descriptions to help build my 6 year olds attention. As well as, random sketched pictures throughout to excite the children's imagination. This has been more than a school assignment, but an excuse to spend real time with my daughter.

B000UFAURI|4.0|There was a time in the late 60's, 70's and early 80's when rock band's were eclectic, experimental, and broad in their musical statements. While everything on the Foo Fighters new album doesn't completely work, I can't say there's any real misfires either. The Foo Fighters have taken their inspiration from Zeppelin, Queen and Pink Floyd, and in the best sense, have retained their core sound while understanding what made those past band's so great. They seemed to have thrown down a gauntlet with the public's perception of what a 'Foo Fighters' song should be, basically laid it all out there for people to decide.    'This is what our sound represents today, take it or leave it.' Pardon the Zeppelin comparison's: yet if 'In Your Honor' was the band's attempt at a 'Physical Graffiti', this album seems like their 'Houses of the Holy' or 'Zeppelin III'. That kind of ambition isn't a bad thing for a band at this stage. The Foo Fighters today is a very different band from what they we're in 1995. There's been some steady growth with this band, and while many will feel that 'Echoes' won't eclipse what they accomplished with 'The Colour and the Shape', perhaps that was never possible for any FF album to surpass their second album.     I'd like to start off by commenting about 'Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners', which a lot of people seem to be critical of. It reminds me a little of Zeppelin's 'Bron-Yr-Aur' or Page's 'White Summer'. In my opinion, if those pieces were valid for Zeppelin, then this instrumental is valid for the Foo Fighters. There's some good, brisk playing, and I've noticed with Dave Grohl there's a trend in his acoustic writing that's very percussive. 'Stranger Things Have Happened' is a simple yet haunting number that continues to grow on me. The first half is filled with some great cuts, 'Pretender, Let It Die, Erase', I find 'Long Road' to be not as interesting. 'Come Alive' progresses nicely, parts of it remind me the kind of thing Jethro Tull used to do. 'Cheer Up, Boys' is a good opening for the second half. I find 'Summer's End' to be the song that grabs me the least. Between 'Statues' and 'Home', I find 'Statues' to be a more compelling song. Yet the band should be credited for taking the risk of including two piano ballads, neither feels very forced, contrived, or calculated. It simply feels like some pieces that make sense as far as what the band determines should count as a Foo Fighters song. Rounded out by 'But Honestly', a song builds into the kind of intensity of 'Long Way Home.'    Far too many band's, once they've established a certain signature sound, are afraid to broaden their palette, for fear of being label 'sell out' or 'has been'. I'm happy to see FF keep taking those risks, it keeps me coming back for more.

B000J4QWM2|2.0|Michael Mann seems most at home at night. His night sequences are stunningly vibrant Cities. Unfortunately Mann often gets caught up in the settings, and soundtrack. Miami   Vice is a great example. While Mann has set up a story which is suitable, what prevents this movie from being a classic of action cinema is the way in which the locations and soundscapes take center stage. Ok, some of the acting wasn't very good at all, but it is an action movie. As a result the movie has the feel of a 133 music video. This sounds cool in principle but Miami vice isn't a music video, or a musical. Nor is it an amazing piece of cinematography. As a result the pull away from its core gives the movie a hollow and sometimes disjuncted feel.       The character development is the main victim of this. We neither feel sympathy, connection, nor awe for either Rico(Jamie Foxx), or Sonny (Colin Farrell). Of course Colin Farrell's acting doesn't help the audience connect with Sonny, who at then end of the movie winds up little better then a sociopath at the end of the movie. Jamie Fox's character on the other hand lack would lack the same emotional dynamic if not for a contrived plot twist which doesn't work, and Jamie Foxx's acting abilities, which while not phenomenal are present.      This movie is a minimal action movie. It lacks the plot or suspense to carry it successfully as a drama, and the action is actually fairly minimal, limited to a few brief flashes, and a cool gunfight at the end. Basically we get to watch Jamie Fox and Colin Farrell be cool, have sex, and smuggle drugs. That's it. Save your money.
B00006EXDM|2.0|I have had the cassette version of this album for over 15 years and thought the cd version would sound better on my stereos.  The cassette version's audio quality is better equalized and balanced than this remastered cd.  I just recieved the cd version of this \\"remastered\\" album and after listening to it on my BOSE stereo system and my car stereo system, I can honestly say that this is the worst quality cd I have ever listened to.  It was worse than listen to an AM station in a tunnel.  Do yourself a favor and buy and older version, maybe before they \\"remastered\\" it.

B000ASDFJU|3.0|Just an FYI.  If you order each of the 6 seasons individually for about $20 ea. (there are 7 sets total, because season 6 is broken into 2). From what I can see, you can save about $60 buying them individually and the content is the same.  Sure, the packaging might not be as nice, and the individual box sets will take up more space, but seriously... is that really worth the extra $60?
B000UR366S|5.0|For those of us who cherished the music of Joni Mitchell over the years it seemed we had reached the end with the release of Both Sides Now in the year 2000. The standards album of non-Mitchell material performed with an evidently terminally eroded voice had a potent tragic quality to it. Add to that a string of albums that reissued new assortments of per-released songs and a heap of tribute albums and the only conclusion one could reach was \\"end of career\\".    Then Shine came along. The album is everything that the past several years have left us longing for. Sure Joni's voice does not have the lilting fluidity or range of her early years, but instead it has a poignancy and maturity to it. She displays the veteran actor's mastery of subtle inflection that stirs the soul. The music is as brilliant as ever, her lyric content as relevant. An updated rendition of Big Yellow Taxi takes on a more ominous tone just, as our changing perspective has stirred our consciousness. The album taken as a whole displays an eerie bittersweet character to it reminiscent of other records like Blue yet not resembling it at all. In Shine we are reminded that an artist's career does not ever end. Shine is a dark and mysterious, beautiful and fully mature offering. Shine stands tall among Joni Mitchell's best work. Thank you Joni

B00065GX64|5.0|This is one seriously disturbing movie. Fritz Lang created several masterpieces (e.g., Metropolis) in his career, but M is unique. This was Lang's first \\"talkie\\" and to be honest the dialog means little to your ears if you're watching M and can't understand German (you can read English subtitles - very well done in the recent criterion release on DVD). Yet the \\"talkie\\" nature of M is critical when Lorre's character whistle's chords from Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt before each chilling moment. I found this use of a simple repeated musically element to be one of the most effective I have ever heard in a film. If you don't like subtitles M won't be your cup of tea, but if they don't bother you then check this movie out. You'll have chills for a while I promise! 5 stars!<br /><br />*This review is of the Criterion 1999 version.

6305546789|5.0|Quite simply the best modern horror movie, no ifs, ands or buts!!!! Many films have tried (unsuccessfully) to repeat what Halloween accomplished but almost all rely on cheap sight gags and have no real atmosphere. Halloween is good cinema.<br /><br />This is the movie that put Carpenter on the map.  Young and brash but having fun making film, Carpenter and his band of 20 something's took a simple concept and made it something great.  Even now 30+ years after its release, it doesn't fail to deliver.  If you enjoy horror movies filled with blood and to have all scares made obvious for you, Halloween is not going to be your movie.  This movie is about mood, mood and more mood.  The ability of Halloween to deliver chills and suspense is derived from several `things that work'.  First, is Carpenter's sense of style and what to film and not film.  So often directors, especially suspense/horror directors don't hold things back, forgetting that that human imagination is often so much more powerful than what you can create for someone else visually.  Carpenter keeps this close (although certainly given his later works at least part of the effectiveness of Halloween was its low budget which necessitated use of little versus more).  So what you don't see in Halloween is as important as what you do see.  I liken this to a great drummer - take Neil Peart (RUSH) or Buddy Rich, it's not simply what they play but when they chose NOT to throw a rimshot in at a spot where essentially all other drummers would that makes their music special!<br /><br />The next component that `worked' for Carpenter in creating a masterpiece was employment of Dean Cundey as cinematographer.  Cundey's work sets the tone, the photography is quite simply amazing, especially given the limited budget and  minimal sets. Scenes such as that which follows Laurie's (Jamie Lee character) discovery of the bodies as she backs against the wall in shock and the `Shape' appears in the otherwise perfectly black doorway, caught in a dull blue hue, is not only scary, but visually brilliant.  This is just one example of taking a simple shot and making it something more.  It also demonstrated Carpenter's visual and emotional sense since the scare is certainly more subtle (yet very effective) than one might expect.<br /><br />No ensemble movie is good with a good ensemble cast.  Halloween has that and for next to nothing in terms of known entities.  Donald Pleasance is really the sole star, and even then his star was already heading into its twilight when cast in Halloween (a movie he initially had no interest in doing).  Jamie Lee Curtis, while a huge female star now, was just a kid, daughter of Janet Leigh and Tony Curtis, with little real experience when Carpenter cast her.  What an absolutely fortuitous and wonderful casting it was too.  Certainly the acting can be a bit rough at times - this is a B-budget movie afterall - but generally the cast pulls out their best and Carpenter, together with Cundey, show the audience only the best.<br /><br />Lastly, Carpenter, who scores nearly all of his movies, provides one of the most critical elements to Halloween's success with its completely hair raising and goose-pimple-generating musical score.  No one can forget that simple repeated motif; my wife to this day will cover her ears or leave a room if I play the first 8-10 counts of the main theme.  Certainly testament to linking audio elements with visual and ultimately visceral elements to give more to less.<br /><br />Halloween is a five star movie, not to be missed during the Halloween season.

B000EQHHJW|5.0|There are two main reasons to get this dvd - 1) the cinematographic and artistic realization of a very literal interpretation of Verdi's favourite opera, 2) Gruberova.    This is a sort of verismo version of Rigoletto. I think this is deliberate - it is filmed in a lavish Parmesan location, the characters, particularly Rigoletto, are played in a fairly non-stereotyped way (except perhaps Pavarotti but that owes more to the fact that he actually can't act very well), there is an emphasis on providing a coherent, integrated vision of the work.  This is probably quite apt given that it is a film rather than a staged adaptation of the work - a lot of effort has gone into the acting and making the characters seem very real human beings.   The key to this is perhaps Gruberova since I have always found Gilda to be the least convincing of characters in the opera yet with this nuanced performance, not to mention utterly beautiful singing replete with superb coloratura, she does cast a really credible Gilda that comes of age and is fatally abused.  Gruberova is truly terrific; if Gobbi is the ultimate Rigoletto, then Gruberova is the ultimate Gilda - forget Callas who is not sweet sounding enough and not convincing as an 'innocent flower', forget Sutherland, forget modern performers such as Cortrubas and Schafer, Gruberova is the one!  Gruberova apart, we have Pavarotti at his peak - not the greatest of actors but not terrible at least, and at this age he looks the part, Wixell - fine acting performance whereby he plays Rigoletto as a fairly normal human being that is just a bit smaller and uglier than the rest, as compared to, for example, Gobbi who plays Rigoletto in a more stereotyped manner. Wixell has a powerful but not beautiful voice and consequently such great solos as 'deh non parlar' and the final death scene perhaps transmit a little less emotional meaning than might otherwise be the case with a more tender sounding Rigoletto. Nevertheless, such scenes are still imbued with emotion such is Ponelle's cinematographic work - I particularly like the cinematographic realization of the death scene where father and daughter are sort of isolated in a boat on the river and Gilda's death appears as if not noticeable to anyone in the world but Rigoletto which somewhat highlights Rigoletto's isolation; however, Gobbi and also Gavanelli from the recent Covent Garden/McVicar production have far superior tonality which allows for Rigoletto's hidden tenderness to come out much more. Gobbi, in particular, was able to produce a real Jekyll and Hide of a Rigoletto where Wixell here plays him in a more literal way - consistent with the style of the film. It is an interesting interpretation but I prefer Gobbi.    Everything else is nice. Sometimes the directing descends into cliche where we have a lot of annoying and unconvincing 'evil laughs' particularly from Pavarotti that belong more to pantomime than opera. Similarly the close ups of Monterone look a little ridiculous though i think the playing up of the psychological impact on Rigoletto of 'la maledizione' is a nice touch. It emphasizes the role that Rigoletto plays in his own downfall - so desperate to protect himself and his daughter that he is willing to tread on everyone else and their daughters beside! In trying to adapt to survive the brutality of his fellow citizens he has become so corrupted by the true 'maledizione' that is the Duke's rule, court and all in the vicinity that it has contaminated everything he loves in spite of his best efforts.    This is a Rigoletto that is a more complete and sophisticated interpretation therefore than certain other staged productions, such as McVicar's at ROH - though in this case the comparative simplified thematic emphasis, on the dichotomy of inward and outward beauty/ugliness, serves to render certain of the Rigoletto-Gilda scenes more emotionally impacting and therefore perhaps it is inappropriate, given the relative complexity of the themesinvolved in the opera, to refer to this or any other version as definitive.   However, I think this is a version that must stand up to the best of them  with the central reasons for buying this, therefore, the thematically complex versimo perspective of Rigoletto that it provides and the outstanding overall performance of Gruberova that must be the finest Gilda performance available on video.
033041836X|5.0|I have always told anyone I recommended Alice Sebold to that her books are like Saving Private Ryan: if you can make it through the first half hour, you can make it through the rest.   Sebold is very fond of putting her most brutal, hard content on the very first pages, in the first chapter, and in a way, it weeds out the people with the stomach for this sort of writing from the ones who do not. She lets you know immediately where she is coming from.  The details are so graphic, so real, that it is almost disturbing to the reader as you actually begin to place yourself into the pages, into the thick of the suffering that Sebold endured during and after her rape. One thing that always stayed with me was her talk of a pink hair tie, lying amongst the leaves and debris in the tunnel where she was raped, and her wondering if it had been the murdered girl before her's property. Those things, those moments, are so realistic and so intense that it makes me consider that there may never have been another writer of our time that captures the essence of a real thought process and the real world. Stream of conciousness, it is not, but it is just as alarming in its sincerity.   In short, I cannot WAIT for her next work, and I commend Sebold for being able to be blunt but vulnerable, making sure that she is not wilting underneath the cold reality of her experiences but she is not demeaning their power either.   A must-read for any woman.

B0002WZTOI|4.0|1986's \\"Top Gun\\" had a lot going for it: a first rate production staff featuring the action partnership of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, direction by Tony Scott, and lead acting by a young Tom Cruise and a still youthful Kelly McGillis, backed by a solid supporting cast that included Val Kilmer, Anthony Edwards, Tom Skerrit, Michael Ironside and, in cameos, Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins.  Couple this horsepower with a superb popular music score, lots of action sequences featuring the Navy's hot F-14 fighter aircraft, and hijinks and angst among young naval aviators, and you have a great action movie that spent months in the theaters.<br /><br />The storyline centers around Navy LT Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise), a brash, immature, but gifted flier.  In a close encounter with enemy Migs over the Persian Gulf, Maverick saves his wingman and earns a slot at the prestigious Fighter Weapons School for himself and his backseater, \\"Goose\\" (played with everyman humility by Anthony Edwards).<br /><br />At the school, Maverick quickly develops a rivalry with his chief competitor, Iceman (played with suitable demeanor by Val Kilmer) and a romance with one of his instructors, \\"Charlie\\" (Kelly McGillis).  However, Maverick's willingness to push the flying envelope gets him and Goose into an horrific flying accident.<br /><br />The accident robs Maverick of his self-confidence and threatens to take him out of the cockpit altogether.  Some gentle mentoring by one of his flight instructors (Tom Skerrit) gets Maverick back out to his carrier, right in the middle of an confrontation with the bad guys.  In a vicious aerial dogfight involving an outnumbered Maverick and Iceman, Maverick must finally grow up and become a team player.<br /><br />An absolutely terrific music score and action sequences involving dog-fighting F-14's and \\"Red team\\" aircraft (cutting edge at the time) tend to mask a sometimes incoherent script.  The romance between Maverick and Charlie gets worked in around the flying sequences, as does a rather obscure sub-plot involving Maverick's MIA father.  The jumpy editing causes supporting cast to sometimes wander in and out of scenes without real introduction or explanation.<br /><br />Minor flaws aside, \\"Top Gun\\" continues to hold up well as a highly enjoyable action movie twenty years on.s does a rather obscure sub-plot involving Maverick's MIA father.

But i've also loathed a lot of the forementioned...which caused me to very frequently and very unfortunately  forget how I loved what came before his solo work.  (And stylistically, at least, I count \\"The Rising\\" as solo stuff.)

B000QQFKYE|5.0|Yes, it really is. As a longtime Lynchhead, and a great admirer of films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and Mullholland Drive, Inland Empire takes all of the things that made those films great and ups the ante in the most provocative way. Of course, naysayers will say that this film is turgid and incomprehensible. Think of Lynch as Samuel Beckett's illegitimate son and maybe his art will begin to make sense (you'll get a better idea of where he's coming from, at least). It's long (3 hours), and it will test your patience at times, but Inland Empire is without question a new watermark in avant-garde American cinema. Orson Welles and Stanley Kubrick would be proud.

1878424602|2.0|When I purchased this book, I thought it was simply a new edition of the original book of the same title.  After all, why would it be necessary to  \\"ABRIDGE\\" a 111-page book?  Anyway, I ordered 12 copies of it as I was using it for a class.  Only too late did I discover it was a shortened version of the original masterpiece (and Amazon would not exchange it for what I wanted).  I suppose the book was reissued in this format as part of a new marketing effort associated with the DVD movie of the same name.        Whatever the reason, there is no need to buy this instead of the original title --which is a jewel for anyone's library!

B0000DD7LC|4.0|I was a little disappointed with this. Her voice is still wonderful and she still uses the piano to great effect on some songs, but she also started letting too many other people have control of the music, and because of that, this album turns out to be more of a mess than her debut. I'll still give it four stars because \\"If I Ain't Got You\\" is a definite masterpiece, but Alicia needs to take more control over what goes into her albums, and what ever producer or other person led her into the sinful land of sampling needs to lead her right back out. She has too much talent to be ruining her music like that.

As always Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens delivers a powerful vocal performance with tons of high pitched shrieks.  Some standout tracks are Ten Thousand Strong, Order of the Rose, and The Domino Decree.

Baker, whose music is currently in the rotations of just about every soul and smooth jazz radio station on the planet, may well just be one of the top 10 most deserving people of such an honor.

B000099T2L|3.0|For me, giving a good review to anything that's less than 10 years old can be difficult, because I do believe that today's popular music has already dug itself into an impossibly deep hole that it will never get out of, and while this album will not change that, it is nonetheless a fairly respectable album from a decent if not extraordinary entertainer. The hits \\"Me, Myself & I\\", \\"Baby Boy\\" and \\"Crazy In Love\\" were fun and catchy tunes that can be enjoyable nowadays since their days of being played out have subsided. Of course, the appeal of these songs and the album is diminished somewhat by the fact that some of them are sample-based, but overall, this album was definitely better than some of its directly competing counterparts at the time.
B000QXDED6|3.0|300: Being the Story of King Leonidis of Sparta...as told \\"With Advantages\\" by Frank Miller & Co.<br /><br />The city-state of Sparta is ruled by King Leonidis, who has several problems. First, he seems to have been cursed by an angry Greek god to be able to speak only in clich&eacute;s delivered at eardrum-destroying volume. PREPARE FOR GLORY! THIS IS SPARTA! PREPARE YOUR BREAKFASTS AND EAT HEARTY FOR TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!) Second, his tiny kingdom is being menaced by the numberless hordes of God-King Xerxes of Persia, who demands that Sparta humble itself before his Pefect Abs. Third, his authority is undermined by a scheming politico, a knock-kneed senate and by his oracles, leprous cretins who sell out to the highest bidder. And fourth, whenever he opens his mouth, the Millenium Falcon flies inside and looks for a place to land, mistaking this cavernous space for the interior of a large asteroid.<br /><br />300 opens with an explanation of the Spartan state and its charming folkways. In Sparta, we are told by the narrator (also afflicted with a curse; in this case, the tragic compulsion to exceed the stupidity of Harrison Ford's narration in BLADE RUNNER) babies are inspected at birth for physical imperfection; the smallest flaw and they are dashed off a cliff before they can pollute the Spartan Volk with their Untermensch-like qualities. At the age of eight, Spartan males are driven out into the wilderness to prove their manhood by stealing food and fighting animals with their bare hands. Once manhood is achieved, a Spartan is expected to do lots of crunches and laugh in the face of death. Since \\"only Spartan women give birth to men\\" the Spartans have an attitude which could best be described as \\"big man on campus syndrome meets THE TRIUMPH OF THE WILL.\\" This is the reason why Leonidis doesn't take to the power-pretentious of Xerxes (only Spartans are allowed impose their will on others!) and hurls the God -King's messenger into a conveniently located bottomless pit.<br /><br />Having committed this blasphemy (the first of many in the film; Spartans apparently subscribe the the heartwarming credo of the SS, i.e. that since everyone else is sub-human, human considerations apply only to themselves) Leonidis finds himself betwixt a literal rock and a hard place. The Persian hordes are descending upon him, but he can't defy his senate and declare war on Xerxes, either. So he does the next best thing; taking a hand-picked force of 300 \\"volunteers\\", he strolls off to a geographical bottleneck in southern Greece called the \\"hot gates\\", a narrow pass which Xerxes army must trevail if the God-King wants to conquer the rest of the peninsula, and there awaits his enemy.<br /><br />From that point on, 300 degenerates (or ascends, depending on your POV) into one seemingly endless bloodbath, as the faceless stormtroopers, er, Cylons, er, you get the picture, soldiers of Xerxes try to force open the Hot Gates (pornographic reference unintended...by me, anyway) using everything from blizzards of arrows to elephants to firebombs to half-human monsters, only to end up as spear-fodder for Leonidis' all-star killing squad. Every manner of hideous death is encountered, from impalings and slashings to drownings, immolations, decapitations, eviscerations, disembowelments, and dismemberings without number. Blood spatters. Heads roll. Limbs cartwheel. Wounded Persians sob for mercy (pansies!) only to be speared like rabbits by bored Spartans (who carry out conversations with each other as they adminster the coup de grace). But the Spartans just won't budge. They are like a brass-plated chastity belt across the Hot Gates of Greece!<br /><br />Unfortunately for Leonidis, while he cannot be bested by iron, he is highly vulnerable to irony. A deformed Spartan, whose parents (obviously sentimental fools) spirited him away at birth to prevent his brains from being dashed out on a rock, has appealed to the King to let him fight for his country in itshour of need. Leonidis declines, and in a fit of humilated rage the geek limps off to Xerxes, who does his best Satan impersonation (\\"All this can be thine; if thou will only worship Me\\") and elicits the information he needs about Leonidis' weaknesses to win the battle. Or so he thinks...<br /><br />300 is of course closely based on a graphic novel by the legendary Frank Miller, which is in turned based off the real-life battle of Thermopolae, and on a visual level the film closely mimics Miller's work - lush-yet-stark, vibrantly colored, and hyperstylized. Unfortunately the producers went a bit too far copying Miller's style: what works for a graphic novel often falls flat as a film. The acting is solid, but occasionally undermined by clunky dialogue and continuously oppressed by silly-stupid narration, which does a terrific job of telling us what we have just seen and should feel. The pacing of the movie is actually fairly sluggish, particularly early on; the violence numbs the eye after awhile; and the moral message of the movie is a head-scratcher.<br /><br />Now I must say that I am a fascist, and so you would think all this saber-rattling, bully-worship and battlefield gore would appeal to me. And on a superficial level, it does. I reject the liberal arguments against it. But really, the film is frightening because it is far too admiring of the Spartans, who were first-class warrior athletes, but whose ideology as a nation-state-race was barely above the level of a drunken belch. The moral factor in war, as judged by Napoleon, is worth three times the physical factor; muscle and steel only get you so far. After that, it's nice to be fighting for something other than, oh, bragging rights about who has the biggest spear. And that's what this movie really is: a super-stylized p*ssing contest between a manly-man-tyrant (Leonidis) and an androgynous-god-tyrant (Xerxes) for the right to exploit Greece for the benefit of a small clique. The stakes don't seem very important, since whichever one wins, the average Greek peasant will still be handing over his harvest to the muscular boss-class and getting a lash on the kisser in payment. The fact that Xerxes is out for himself, while Leonidis is out for SPARTA (an extension of himself as he is of it) is pretty much semantic. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.<br /><br />I would be lying if I said this movie wasn't enjoyable on some levels. As entertainment it passes the test. But on an intellectual level it should probably be thrown off a cliff before it can breed.t of humilated rage the geek limps off to Xerxes, who does his best Satan impersonation (\\"All this can be thine; if thou will only worship Me\\") and elicits the information he needs about Leonidis' weaknesses to win the battle.

B000QXDED6|5.0|_The 300_ (2007) is a film based on the graphic novel _300_ by Frank Miller which provides a fictionalized account of the Battle of Thermopylae.  In this film, an army of 300 Spartans must face the Persian army led by King Xerxes.  The Spartans are portrayed as freedom loving men who must fight to the last man against the Persian hordes who intend to enslave them (although this portrayal has been claimed to be somewhat historically inaccurate).  Most of the film is taken up by battle scenes, following the Spartan king Leonidas learning that the Persians intend to enslave his people.  Leonidas, who has been trained for battle since youth, consults the Oracle as to what he should do about the situation with the Persians, and is told that he should not go to war so as to not interrupt the sacred festival.  Leonidas disobeys the priests and the Oracle and leads his army of 300 of the best picked Spartans against the hordes of Xerxes.  The rest of the film involves the subsequent battle that ensues, in which the 300 must fight to the last man, greatly outnumbered.  It should be pointed out that the 300 Spartans are highly trained for battle, having been handpicked since youth and having as their sole profession that of soldiering.  Xerxes unleashes his army of slaves and many of them fall to the far more battle-hardy Spartans, who easily defeat them.  Xerxes appears in the film as a seven-foot tall androgynous god-king and poses a challenge to the Spartan king Leonidas.  While the battle is taking place, Leonidas' queen must face her own set of challenges back home.  Ultimately however, the conflict does not bode well for the heavily outnumbered Spartans.    This movie is a decent film that reflects on the history of ancient Greece.  The imagery is unique and it is probably worth watching for that alone.  While the movie may be slow in parts, in that it is simply one battle scene after another, it probably deserves to be watched simply for its imagery and for the historical value.
1416523359|3.0|Like so many others, I am a longtime Stephen King fan, although I have to say up front that I liked the early ones better than the later ones.<br /><br />This is a readable book that engages you with its storyline. However, this seems to be written by a peculiarly angry and misogynistic King. Yes, his main character is a woman, but the language of the book and the treatment of this woman is harsher than I have previously encountered (maybe he got this way with his characters after I strayed from his books?). I am not referring to character behavior (he can make his characters as unlikeable as he pleases) but the narrative and plot as written by King. Maybe he is not interested in female readership? I almost came back, but...no thanks. I require a little more respect for my gender from my authors.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I LOVED the theatrical release of this, with Planet Terror and all. With that said, I think I am the only one a little relieved that they split the movies up. All the people who gave this one star because of the split and say that they loved the movie, obviously didn't love the movie. I tolerated the whole 3hr+ thing on opening night, but when I sit down to watch a movie at home, I know that I won't be able to sit through the whole thing again, so the split will be perfect. The dvd is packed with extra stuff to satisfy, and the movie itself is awesome, in my opinion. The character development is fantastic and interesting, and this is coming from a guy that usually likes when movies get to the point. The only complaint I have is that they girls didn't kick Kurt Russels a** enough....So once again, winnie babies, go get your bottle and sit down. This DVD is great.

B000O1799U|1.0|I can't believe I actually thought this movie would be good. And I love musicals! (I do own Grease one and two, Sound Of Music etc - I am that sad.) I was actually warned before hand that the characters actually start SINGING their lines to each other, but I figured, every musical does that at some point - against a backing track. But no, there's no backing track at the some point, and it's simply stupid for them to start singing their lines.<br /><br />Basically, there's no story. It's trying to work a story around the songs, basing the story around the story of the Supremes, and also possibly Destiny's Child if you look closely enough. There's absolutely no point to Eddie Murphy's character, he has become a paraody of himself, and was pretty much playing Donkey the entire role.<br /><br />Beyonce lost approximately 20lbs to play this role, which was absolutely unnecessary since she had a gorgeous figure as it was. She thankfully, doesn't go too skinny, which could have been possible, but yet I don't think they would have told Jennifer Hudson to lose weight somehow!<br /><br />The film does start to go somewhere towards the end, for their final show, and just before Deena gets fed up with her life, and records the brilliant song \\"Listen\\". The lyrics meant a lot to me when I heard it on her album, but the lryics mean so much more in the film. It's really the only part of the movie that works.<br /><br />I would warn everybody to avoid this movie as much as possible. There's no point to it.
B000TETELI|5.0|What can I say but \\"Classic Floyd\\".  They don't make music like this anymore.  It is a shame that there aren't bands out there willing to put the effort into becoming TRULY GREAT ICONS in the modern world.

0452285186|4.0|Bunnies are cute, fuzzy, and not very bright. And in Andy Riley's works, they're also suicidal.<br /><br />In fact, you can guess just from the title of Riley's \\"The Book of Bunny Suicides\\" what the book is about -- wordless cartoons of bunnies offing themselves in unique, creative, and sometimes overly complex ways.<br /><br />It's a running gag, but you'll never guess how many of these bunnies choose to off themselves -- they involve corkscrews, subway trains, stalactites, cigarettes,  seppuku, airplane toilets, palm trees, pointy-nose jets, toasters, colanders, and many other seemingly harmless (or at least not VERY harmful) ordinary items.<br /><br />There are even some pop culture references -- the bunny prepares to beam down from \\"Star Trek,\\" sits atop the Wicker Man from the same-named movie, and one of the rare cartoons with dialogue, the death-pursuing bunnies infiltrate the legendary duel between Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Hysterical.<br /><br />Yeah, it's basically a one-gag book, but Riley manages to keep the chuckles rolling along through the book. Part of the humor is in the ridiculous stubbornness these bunnies have to off themselves, and Riley's creativity in coming up with surreal methods for suicide.<br /><br />There are a few duds, admittedly -- the deli counter one took me several reads to understand, since you have to pay very careful attention to note the bunny in this one. And the overpass gag simply doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Riley's artwork is simple and clean, and his bunnies are amusingly stoic as they chase down death. And he shows a variety of bunny deaths -- some are gory, some are physically impossible, and some simply involve bunny parts flying bloodlessly. Some, in fact, only hint at the bunnies' demises -- and these tend to be the most hilarious of all.<br /><br />\\"The Book of Bunny Suicides\\" is a fun quick comic book for people with a sick sense of humour and/or a hatred of bunnies. Darkly amusing.
0897500482|5.0|no style is new---       This book shows the research of Bruce lee's personally preferred fighting methods. it is of course incomplete.  Covers modern boxing, trapping, kicking and yes even grappling. As well as his philosophy.   The JKD stance worked for Bruce, same as a square stance works for Bas (book does not cover square stance). Will it work for you?  Try it and see.   P.S.  You will also notice the corkscrew punch is the same punch employed by fedor and liddell. Bruce didn't invent the punch, but he used it.  --- no style is better.

I feel the centerpiece of this album (and possibly of her solo output) is 'Through the Glass Darkly'.  This has a somewhat eerie vibe to it and her vocal is nothing short of brilliance in it.  It's the perfect vocal track.    I think all the Britneys of the world should be locked up (possibly together) and forced to listen to some Annie.  SOMD would be a nice starting place for them.

0007189885|4.0|I really enjoyed Purple Hibiscus.  I am intrigued by books of different cultures and places.  Some of the content of the book was disturbing and at times heart breaking, but it made for a relistic view into this young girl's life.  I am not a religous person at all but I have to say that the positive spirituality in this book was enlightening and touching.  One of the things that struck me most was the differences in the way the African characters treated family.  There was a lot of love, respect and genuine caring among them, even the younger generation.  Being an American it always amazes me how much many other cultures value their extended family and are willing and WANT to do much for them.  I am looking forward to reading another book by this author and highly reccomend this book.
B000R4SMCW|4.0|With all of the drivel at the video store, here's a pleasant surprise.  This is an excellent film--not quite academy-award level, but just this side of superb.  The acting is exceptional.  The script is pure silk, a mystery that observes every rule and still startles you with its straightforward solution(s).  Nothing is hidden, but the ending is a revelation in every sense of the term.  Hopkins and rural-accent Gosling play off of one another like Hannibal and Clarice, but this time they're on different sides for the duration.<br /><br />With most rentals I keep checking the 'time remaining' screen.  With this film it was over when I thought it was half-finished--two hours flying by in what felt like sixty minutes.  It grabs your attention from the opening scene and doesn't let go until it's done wringing you out like a damp wash rag.  Go for it.

B00005JPRZ|5.0|The great thing about DEATH AT A FUNERAL is that there really is something for everyone. From brief bathroom humor to dark jokes, it's all there, laid out by UK-born director Frank Oz.<br /><br />The title itself is a bit misleading, in that you would think it to be more horror-ish or dramatic. The words \\"Death\\" and \\"Funeral\\" don't normally make you skip to the theater thinking \\"Oh boy! Let's go watch this funny movie!\\" For that, I would fault only the production person who stamped the name on it. But that would be my only one; one which has nothing to do with the rest of this riotously funny film.<br /><br />Like a snake creeping upon its prey, Death at a Funeral also slowly makes its way along, never lurching or jumping ahead of itself, building the comedic moments one upon the other. Starting out (as all the trailers have shown) with Daniel (Matthew Macfadyen) standing in his livingroom, watching his father's coffin being delivered in preparation for a British homestyle service. But once the coffin is open, Daniel states, \\"That's not my father.\\" The funeral home quickly whisks away the casket and returns with the right one. This gradual sinking in of dark comedy holds the film together exceptionally well.<br /><br />We're then introduced to the rest of the cast...<br /><br />Jane (Keeley Hawes, [[ASIN:B000EOTFBW Tristram Shandy - A Cock and Bull Story]]), Daniel's wife who's pressuring him to buy a flat in the city and leave his now widowed mother with his successful brother in New York.<br /><br />Simon (Alan Tudyk, [[ASIN:B000Q9IZ5C Serenity]]), who is arriving at the funeral with his soon-to-be wife and is stressed about meeting (again) his future father-in-law, so is accidentally given a pill thought to be valium but, in reality, turns out to be a powerful hallucinogenic. This sends Simon on a running joke throughout the film, including periods of catatonia, color fascinations, and rooftop nudity.<br /><br />Uncle Alfie (Peter Vaughan, [[ASIN:B000F5GNX8 KISS KISS BANG BANG]]), a crotchety old fart who's brought to the funeral in a wheelchair only to find himself with explosively needy bowels and the witness to a possible murder.<br /><br />Peter (Peter Dinklage), a midget-of-a-man with big life aspirations who comes to the funeral not only to mourn the death of a close \\"friend,\\" but to also get what \\"he deserves\\" from the family.<br /><br />There are other perpetrators in the film, too, but these are the main ones who's paths cross just about everyone else's.<br /><br />The film's short 90 minute run time is excellent in that none of the funnies are overdone. They have their moment and are either tossed aside or folded over into the film's grand finale. The number one folding in of jokes has to be the faux-valium pill bottle that gets lost and re-lost only to spring up at the most hilarious moments.<br /><br />This is a laugh-a-minute film that has perfect comedic timing and crucial usage of British pompous humor, along with dark moments that will make watchers cringe and giggle at the same time.brought to the funeral in a wheelchair only to find himself with explosively needy bowels and the witness to a possible murder.

B000001ES9|3.0|This is part one a comprehensive four part series of Reviews of the music of the Progressive Rock band Rush.  When a band has been around as long as RUSH has (30 years), their styles will change just as their clothing and hairstyles.  I group the bands first five releases into what I call \\"Early RUSH\\".  These albums are: Rush I (1974), Fly By Night (1975), Caress of Steel (1975), 2112 (1976), and All the World's a Stage \\"Live\\" (1976).<br /><br />Rush's debut album was a pretty good effort. The first thing is that all the songs were originals, even if some were weaker than others. Many bands have a few \\"covers\\" on their debut releases. Just about any Rush fan would probably say this is not the place to start if you're just getting into Rush.  Not that it's that bad, it's just not the best.  I'm giving this album an honest 3 stars, but that is based on an over-all comparison of the early Rush albums.  Come on, they can't all be 5-stars.<br /><br />I've been buying and listening to Rush albums since the late `70's, and the Rush debut is just one that I don't listen to very much. Some people just love it, they think it's the greatest thing they have ever done. That's fine. Those individuals are probably big fans of Led Zeppelin and other 70's Blues-Rock acts. Alex Lifeson does play some of his heaviest and most direct, in-your-face guitar licks they ever recorded. This album also contains some of Rush's most popular early songs that they have consistently been played for the fans over the decades. These include Working Man and Finding My Way.  In fact, Working Man and Here Again, both clocking in at over seven minutes, begins to hint at Rush's direction towards longer, epic length progressive rock that starts to show up in their follow-up albums.  Rush I is the first and last album to feature drummer John Rutsey, who split with the band due to \\"differences in musical direction\\".<br /><br />Best Tracks: Finding My Way and Working Man

B000V8I2QU|3.0|Dear Mr. Bruce Springsteen,    Although this release is full of great material please remaster this album.  The sound quality appears as if something produced during the 50's.

B00005R24K|3.0|I watched this again a while back and I just cant get into it anymore.  The special effects are so cheesy it is laughable.  The only people that dig it are guys that just get off on tons of gore, but it's not even quality gore. It's some college students making a horror movie on a shoestring, using stuff from their kitchen.      The first half of the film is quite atmospheric and frightening, but then it just gets silly. I prefer the \\"sequel\\" or remake, \\"Evil Dead II\\".  It has a bigger budget and the same great(actually better) directing from Raimi, but also a sense of humor and much better set pieces.  The only humor in \\"Evil Dead\\" is of the unintentional variety.  Which is OK I guess, if you are watching it to laugh at.      If you've never seen \\"Evil Dead\\", skip it and watch \\"Evil Dead II\\" instead. You wont be missing anything.

B000OY8NII|4.0|I usually dislike most Sci-Fi, but I really enjoy Eureka. I liked the show when I first watched it on Sci-Fi station, but I stopped watching because I hate commercials! When I saw the whole 1st season here on Amazon I promptly ordered it so I could watch Eureka without all the commercials! This show has a great cast with wonderful chemistry. I especially like that they add humor, with touches of spirituality, common sense and science. Colin Ferguson's character the sheriff 'Jack Carter' is my favorite, Colin delivers subtle humor very well. I am looking forward for season 2 to come out when it's done!!
B000UJBYD8|4.0|Before you mouth my review, Check my Cult collection out. I have the original singles collection with the cellophane covers, the demos box set, and the rare cult box. Basically I love The Cult. They are without a doubt one of the greatest rock bands ever. Every album is great, even Ceremony which was dogged by some. Born Into This is a very solid album that I did not originally like much, but got better with repeat plays. The single Dirty Little Rockstar is catchy and overall is a great release from one of my top 10 personal favorites.

0375703764|3.0|I got pointed to this book because of its formatting (I'm a sucker for \\"different\\" books as well as interesting covers) and a friend said it's a great book.    The book has been discussed a gazillion times, so I won't repeat the story. I'll just tell you what I found strong and weak. A strength for me is the fact that there are quite a few sections that were pageturners for me. I also loved the section with the letters from J.T.'s mom, so I'll pick up the seperate book about them too. Very strong.     Weaknesses, to me, are by far and foremost the top one: The ending. Tension, excitement, it all builds up, and then doesn't explode into a big wow'ing thing, no, here it just escaped in one of those particularly foul smelling farts. Not a lot of noise, rather unimpressive and it doesn't smell too pretty either. ;) I know that more good writers suffer from not being able to end their stories, but this was rather disappointing to me. Another weakness, in my view, is the amount of material that's useless and can be skipped without getting you into trouble of missing anything. Like watching a soap opera once every 3 weeks, it's enough to know everything.     I like the formatting, although I can see that many find it overdone, especially when measured against the text being delivered. Other books with some non-standard formatting (the raw shark texts, microserfs) had a better content-to-format ratio. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book. I've read many many books that are worse. Unfortunately the ambitious presentation of the material leaves a little disappointed feeling with me after reading it.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|For an era of women's liberation and equality, they still cling to ancient cliches of enthusiastic wonder when it comes to men. Let's face it feminism is an equal opportunity format for being strong, while appearing weak, and Dale is no exception. She is an independant successful woman who still needs a man, and Flash is here to save the day. Flash, being the eligible gentleman that he is, is there for the offering, even though he may venture to a lull with Ming's daughter every now and then.<br />The music here is vibrant, and if you wish it to be loud, by all means, turn your volume sky high, and it's LOUD indeed. Soundtrack CD, or no soundtrack CD.<br />For seventeen dollars, I was not expecting a collectors issue of domineering extras as one reviewer consistantly whined about. I purchase the item for the movie, not the extras, by the way. The movie is good fun, and a relaxation from the boring world we know as planet earth, no matter how cataclysmic it defines the word excitement. Flash Gordon is top notch escapism, and that my friends, is what great motion picture cinema is all about.
B000002H70|5.0|This entire cd is amazing....period I remember the first time I heard it, I played it like 10 times...this is a \\"CLASSIC\\" If you don't have this in your music collection your not a music lover.

B00008QSA5|4.0|This is a great blues album that transcends it's recording date: it's sound is as fantastic and pertinant as if it had been recorded last week.  I don't love every song which is why I rated it a \\"4\\" but it absolutely is a \\"must have\\" album for anyone interested in the blues or trying to develop an interest.  I prefer the un-orchestrated, added versions included on this re-mastered copy but everyone will have their own preference.  Regardless, if you enjoy the genre you will enjoy this album.

His brother, Emile (Peter Sohn) and his daddy Django (Brian Dennehy) just hang out in the trash and don't at all approve of Remy's culinary ambitions and his behavior.<br /><br />After a terrible cooking accident, the rats are evicted and escape through the sewers. Remy is separated from his family. He ends up in Paris. Of course, he ends up near a kitchen. Where else?<br /><br />He sneaks in and works on some soup.

1401300529|5.0|On a late Saturday evening President Truman had dedicated an airport and flown home.  Secretary of State Dean Acheson was on his farm in Maryland. America was doing all of its normal things. Our government was working as usual. We were, however, about to go to war.<br /><br />North Korea had invaded South Korea. President Truman returned to the capital. Yet he made an effort to keep things appearing as normal, as presidents will.<br /><br />The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War, by the late David Halberstam is an excellent book that chronicles this \\"forgotten war\\".<br /><br />You will read about the suffering of GIs and junior officers. Many of the  draftees (men who didn't want to go into this war) were killed. You'll meet some of them. Several million Koreans and the many Americans were wounded. The Korean War brought up a number of constitutional issues that the author discusses brilliantly.<br /><br />Much is written about World War 11 and The Civil War. Even World War 1 has been chronicled a good deal. But The Korean War has not had much attention.<br /><br />This book brings it to life. For those who were not alive when we entered this war, you should read the book. Everyone needs to understand this war, the president of that era, and the central characters who participated in the war.<br /><br />It will give you new insight into this part of our history. This is a well-written book by a very gifted writer.<br /><br />Recommended.

1400034779|1.0|The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency is the first story in a series of mystery novels about Mme. Ramotswe and the detective agency that she opens with the money left to her by her dying father. The catch here, if you hadn't noticed from the title, is that she is a woman, and not only that, the first woman detective in all of Botswana. If you missed that intricate plot detail, never fear, the main character will remind you of it during the course of the story. Again, and again, and again....<br /><br />I debated between one and two stars for this one. It wasn't a total waste. It had some charm to it... some. In the end I give it one star simply because I had much higher expectations for it, and it was a let down. Wow, and what a let down it was! I honestly really thought I would enjoy it. I was interested in the mystery aspect of it. I like a good mystery novel. I have a fascination with Africa, and being set in Africa, I was thinking \\"this looks like a winner.\\"<br /><br />One of the main problems I had with is was the way in which the dialog of the characters was written. Another reviewer described it as \\"baby talk\\", and really, I can't think of any better way to describe it. I keep trying to come up with reasons for why it was written in this manner, but none of them make any sense to me. It just makes the characters come across as stupid, as though African people are incapable of using any words longer than five letters long or expressing themselves with any sort of eloquence what-so-ever.<br /><br />There's also the plot. Mme. Ramotswe solves several cases throughout the story with a certain finesse of Inspector Gadget. SPOILER ALERT! There is the case of the missing Christian husband, who Ramotswe is convinced has run away with another woman (\\"Men are stupid, LOLZ!!!1\\" is a major theme of the book). Turns out he was swallowed whole by a crocodile. Of course! There's the case of the 16 year old girl, who actually outsmarts Ramotswe. The girl is actually the only character in this book that I liked. There's the doctor with seemingly inconsistent talent. Like a plot twist straight out of a daytime soap opera, it turns out he has an identical twin brother who is getting to substitute for him in hospitals so he can hold down two jobs and earn twice the money. Wow! That makes so much sense... wouldn't he spend twice as much since he has to have two places to live? Other than that, I'm sure this is totally probable. And then there is the heart breaking case of a missing boy which challenges Ramotswe the most, and puts her in the most danger... or so says the back cover of the book. Allow me to paraphrase this climax of the book for you:<br /><br />Ramotswe: Your husband murdered a boy for Muti!<br />Witchdoctor's Wife: Not he didn't. The boy is living on a cattle ranch.<br />Ramotswe: Show me.<br />Wife: Okay<br />(drives to ranch)<br />Ramotswe: Are you the boy who was kidnapped from the school teacher.<br />Boy: Yes<br />Ramotswe: Okay, I'm taking you home now.<br />(drives to the boys house and drops him off)<br /><br />Seriously, if you blink, you might miss this climatic ending. I have watched episodes of Scooby Doo with more drama and suspense.<br /><br />In conclusion. Don't read it. Really, just don't waste your time. The No. 1 Detective Agency furthers my belief that it is now possible for anyone to get a book published.<br /><br />The End.t I liked. There's the doctor with seemingly inconsistent talent.

B000024D4R|4.0|Pink Floyd - Animals  Oh my.  Roger's mad about something.    Starting with DARKSIDE, Roger Waters began to gradually assume control of Pink Floyd, a reality of life that would culminate in their last Waters album, FINAL CUT.  DARK SIDE and WISH YOU WERE HERE was at the beginning of this process.    ANIMALS, however, is where you could tell who had set the controls for the heart of the sun, and it sure as hell wasn't Gilmour, Mason, or Wright.  Waters not only took control lyrically, but decided the whole album would be a concept record about the dividing people up in three classes as animals: pigs, the ruling class, sheep, people who do whatever they are told and have no backbone, and dogs, who are cutthroat and only in it for themselves, often subservient to dogs.  Then there's the two brief recordings of \\"Pigs on the Wing\\", which is only two halves of the same song.    This is commonly thought of as Pink Floyd's `Punk album'.  While as far as the music goes this definitely is not punk, the attitude and the lyrical anger definitely coincide with what was going on in the punk movement during the late 1970s.  And make no doubt - Roger's angry.  Real angry.      Going back to the longer song format, oddly enough after the great success of Dark Side and WISHING YOU WERE HERE, there were no real potentials for a single.  The three main songs that formed the bulk of the album were LONG.  \\"Dogs\\" is a 17 minute epic, and Roger just rails against the coatthroat nature of the doglike nature of people.  This is one of Pink Floyd's best epics, both musically and lyrically, with several amazing instrumental passages.  He likewise has some anger-fueled commentary about the sheep and pigs as well, and in the pigs track has a backward track section that is a parody of Psalms 23.  \\"Pigs\\" also has the amazing effect where Waters' main vocal metamorphizes into an guitar note and then that note is broken up with the drums.  Amazing stuff.  Overall, the album sounds very much like Waters was reading a lot of George Orwell at the time he was writing the music.  The album is also notable for the famous Pink Floyd flying pig that went on tour wit them.    As far as the \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" song, I have bee spoiled by the version floating around on the track that was actually released on the 8-track version of the album.  Snowy White, Thin Lizzy's Guitarist and occasional tour musician for Floyd, actually recorded a guitar solo, and this solo was used to link the two halves into a whole, turning the Pigs on the Wing songs from two bookend recordings on the album to a completed song with a running time of 3:25.  Like it much better that way.    And while lyrically there's much akin to punk, ANIMALS stays true to the Pink Floyd sound in ways that only Pink Floyd could have come up with.  The music is both ethereal and spacey and drawn out, yet somehow concise, fast moving, and with some great, hard playing all at once.  Phenomenal stuff.    This was one of my Pink Floyd albums, and I've always enjoyed it.  My tape actually broke Pigs into two portions, with half of it on Side A and the other on Side B, so I always thought there were six songs on it.  While the songs themselves are a little long, overall the album holds up very well.
6305291446|5.0|Of course, the original \\"Halloween\\" can never be topped.  Except maybe by \\"Psycho\\", which can never be topped.  Anyway, who'd have thought the SIXTH sequel would be this scary, witty, and well-cast, with bells and whistles galore?  H20 is all that.      Our sequel begins with Michael breaking into the late Dr. Loomis' house and terrorizing Nurse Marian (a character from the first movie) and two teenagers.  He steals a file kept on Laurie Strode, which revealed that she faked her death and assumed a new identity as headmistress of a \\"very posh, secluded private school in Northern California.\\"  He manages to get from Illinois to Cali in two days (in two really old cars--everything works out for him!), and hijinks ensue.    I love you, Jamie Lee Curtis.  She's one of my all-time favorites.  All her (acting) akills are on display here.  She's smart, funny, vulnerable, strong, neurotic, and controlling, all at the same time.  Without her intelligence, the script's unique efforts to show Laurie's psychic torment over 20 years could easily have come off as unsympathetic psychobabble.  Laurie's had lots of therapy, is highly-medicated, sneaks drinks (not all her self-help efforts are doctor-approved), and won't let her son (far) out of her sight.  Mom and son argue (realistically!) about her \\"irrational\\" fears ruining both their lives.  Most importantly, in the movie's biggest turning point, Laurie passes up the chance to escape and chooses to confront Michael.  Her \\"empowerment\\" is pure edge-of-your-seat entertainment.          The supporting cast is fantastic.  I can't believe some of these other reviews dis the acting.  Yup, no way Josh Hartnett or Michelle Williams are gonna have a future in the business.  The kids playing their friends (Adam Hann-Byrd and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), too far down the supporting cast for safety, actually outplay their now-more-famous costars here.  And, that's none other than LL Cool J as a thoroughly unsuccessful security guard for the school.His phone conversations with his wife, who is only heard on the other end of the line, are perfect comic relief.  Adam Arkin has the worst line in the movie (\\"That's sucky\\"?! when JLC confides that her brother killed her sister!!!???)  He goes on to make an even bigger blunder before...well, never mind...      A scene with Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's real-life mom and ultra-victim in \\"Psycho,\\" actually includes the notorious car from that all-time classic.  Later, \\"Scream 2\\" is playing on a dorm room TV.  And the most soothing oldie one can hear before being brutally slain, the Chordettes' \\"Mister Sandman,\\" again features on the \\"Halloween\\" playlist.    A DVD extra has Curtis, Arkin, director Steve Miner, John Carpenter, and other behind-the-scenes folks discussing H20 and the \\"Halloween\\" phenomenon in general.      Previous films' dialogue from Donald Pleasance is heard over the opening credits (though it may actually be Tom Kane, credited for \\"Voice Over\\"), and the closing credits include a dedication to Pleasance.  High-class touches abound from beginning to end.  A brilliant job by all involved.
B000002U9W|2.0|Pink Floyd - Atom Heart Mother  The Floyd's most inscrutable album.    Pink Floyd is a strange band.  A very strange band.  The type of band that when you listen too them, you shake your head and go \\"How did they ever manage to persuade their record label to actually release this stuff?\\"  No, don't take that as a dig against Pink Floyd, because I'm not slamming them.  I've listened to them for years, love their work, but some of their records it's amazing that any major record label would let a rock band be so damned experimental with their work.    ATOM HEART MOTHER, along with the studio/live UMMAGUMMA, is the premier example of Pink Floyd at their most experimental, and, dare I say it, obtuse.  For the general consumer, this album is impenetrable, and you won't play it that much if at all.  A lot of Pink Floyd albums are comprised of only a few songs, some of which take up the majority of the playing time.  This is one of those albums.  AHM is over 50 minutes long, with only five tracks.  And why is that?    Well, the title cut is a 23:44 minute instrumental, with Pink Floyd backed by a symphony.  For my money, this is probably the band's best instrumental track pre-DARK SIDE, and the symphony works quite well with the band's sound.  The music is very memorable, and for classical music fans, there is a lot to sink your teeth into.  For bootleg fans, there's some recordings of the band going thru the instrumental without the orchestra that is apparently of interest.  Overall, however, the general listener may find it rather difficult to get thru all 23 minutes, especially as the middle section drags for those less then sympathetic to progressive rock. Still, the main instrumental section that begins the track is some of my favorite rock/orchestra work of all time.    The next three tracks are the easily the most accessible for regular rock fans. The songs are concise, and have a rather folky feel to them that listeners unfamiliar with their pre-1973 music may findrather strange coming from this band.  \\"If\\" is a great Roger Waters song that is part of the acoustic singer/songwriter creed or way of life, and lyrically would have fit in well with DARK SIDE, THE WALL, or any of those bitter dark records.  It's one of those \\"my world is awful, life sucks, I'll write a song about it\\" tracks, which is good because Waters excels with melancholy material. \\"Summer `68\\" starts out slow but then becomes pretty fast tempo.  \\"Fat Old Sun\\", a David Gilmour track, is nothing to write home about, but is passable.    Then we get to the absolute nadir of the Pink Floyd Catalogue.  \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.\\"  Imagine almost 14 minutes of mostly sound effects of a guy walking around, cooking breakfast, eating, etc.  Inane.  While Pink Floyd showed themselves quite capable of using sound effects on a recording to enhance the song (\\"Money\\", almost all of DARK SIDE, parts of ANIMALS and THE WALL), here there is no song.  It's sound effects and studio engineering simply for the sake of  -- who knows why they did this.  There was no need to issue such a recording (one hestitates to call it a proper \\"song\\", per say) on one of the major albums.  It's a B-side recording . . . if that.  Better to leave it in the vaults.  It would be unimaginable that a record company would issue anything like this on one of their new albums today, let alone a recording that takes up so much time on the album.  Sadly enough, there are a few portions of actual music in \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" that, had they cut all the breakfast part, would have resulted in a very nice instrumental that would have been a great way to end the album.  That would also free of running time so they could have some shorter songs on the record as well.    Interestingly enough, if you look at bands like Pink Floyd (Rush is another example) with such obtuse, impenetrable records like this issued in the early 1970s (though Rush started in mid to late 1970s), but the 1980s and 1990s, their records have totally changed, with more songs per album and without the insane running times.  There's no way a band these days could issue an album as obtuse and as difficult to get into in today's market.    The best thing about the album is the cover, designed by Storm Thorgerson. (Storm did all of Pink Floyd's album covers, as well as a lot of work for other rock artists.  Very famous.  Recent work includes the cover for Audioslave's LP).  Without a doubt, this is one of Storm Thorgerson's all time best album covers.  The picture of the cow is so wonderfully strange it fits the album to a tee, and appropriately enough has absolutely nothing to do with the music inside.  That, along with the strange title, tells you this is not one of those normal records of popmusic or Mama and Daddy's Gospel Hour, but some far out stuff indeed.  It's also notable this is the first album released by a major label that does have the band featured on the record sleeve.      Overall, ATOM HEART MOTHER is one of those records purely for the Pink Floyd fans and progressive rock fans.  No one else will bother, which is sad as the first four songs are rather good, as well as the musical portions of the abominable \\"Breakfast\\".
B000AP04L0|3.0|I've seen this film twice, and I have to admit, it's nowhere nearly as good as many of its fans claim.  It feels undernouirshed and way too episodic.  The director, Mike Judge, came from TV, and it has a TV feel to it, as opposed to a cinematic feel.  The film doesn't flow at all.  The scenes go awkardly from one to the next.  However, there are some priceless moments (the conversation about \\"flair\\", Ron Livingston's great line about work (ain't exactly missing it), the destruction of the copy machine), but all these moments are actually in the trailer.  A lot of times between gags the film seems to be killing time, and the film ends up being very boring.  Some might argue that office work is boring (it is), but still, a realistic portrayal doesn't always translate into great filmmaking.  The performances here are first rate, with the underrated Gary Cole giving a hilarious one as Ron Livingston's boss.  Livingston himself makes a great sad sack and Jennifer Aniston is nice as the waitress who is Ron's love interest.  It's not the deepest romance ever, but it passes the time.  The film is not a disaster, far from it, but it is overrated and not a great comedic gem.  Still, there are very funny moments which make it worth watching at least once.
B000002U82|5.0|The problem with some albums (most of The Beatles' catalogue, Zeppelin, Radiohead, etc) is so much has been written about them there's not a lot new to say.  For DARK SIDE OF THE MOON I figured I'd examine the record more in the context of their catalogue overall, as this is not very often examined in Amazon reviws.    As I've said in other reviews, Pink Floyd has always been a weird band.  There's a reason why they're considered the ultimate space-rock band.  And while there are other albums in their catalogue that are even spacier and more strange than the perennial favorite DARK SIDE OF THE MOON (ATOM HEART MOTHER and PIPER AT THE GATES OF DOWN, to name but two), it is here, on this album, that the band trimmed back their wild experiments to manageable songs.  And once the general public figured out what Pink Floyd was capable of, they bought the record in droves.    Pink Floyd has a sizeable catalogue that dates before DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.  While the Pink Floyd Faithful know these albums, a lot of fans don't know these records, and if they go looking for another DARK SIDE, they are often puzzled at the music they do find.  There's a reason for that.    Pre-1973, Pink Floyd was very much on the outer edges of rock music.  Like The Grateful Dead, they played by their own rules, and invented and subverted their own musical forms into something druggy, ethereal, and far beyond the scope of any normal popsong.  Listening to early Pink Floyd records is like an audio-acid trip, and it's surprising that not only did they get to release such experimental music, with no real chance of getting radioplay or singles, but they got to release so many albums of it.  With today's market and expectations and pro-tools mentality of the quest for the perfect popsong that will be the next big hit, the early PF records would never have been released.      All this changed in 1972, when Pink Floyd released their criminally underrated soundtrack OBSCURED BY CLOUDS.  The true precursor to DARK SIDE, OBSCURED was recorded just as the initial sessions for DARK SIDE began.  Moving away from the side-long suites and long winding instrumentals, OBSCURED features 10 songs, only four of which are instrumentals, with the other six songs being very akin to the DARK SIDE songs.  It is with OBSCURED that Pink Floyd began writing music that would be much more accessible to the general record-buying public.    Pink Floyd continued in the direction they began with OBSCURED BY CLOUDS.  Streamlining their music, Pink Floyd forwent the rather bizarre experiments that made up the bulk of their previous work.  But don't think they sold out.  Everything in DARK SIDE has precedent in their previous work.    While there's nothing that truly sounded like DARK SIDE in 1973, the music sounds very much like a culmination of all their previous experimentation (not counting Barret's PIPER) dating from 1968 to 1972.   But rather than let their audio love of sound effects get away with them (\\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\"), or draw their often fascinating instrumental music to gargantuan proportions (\\"Echoes\\", \\"Atom Heart Mother\\") that only prog fans will wade through, the band took the elements of their overall sound, streamlined it, and used much more accessible songwriting, but still being true to their artistic vision.    And it is a vision and a sound that a lot of people love.  DARK SIDE epitomizes what the band was capable of.  Filled with sound effects, spacey music, turbocharged [turbocharted] instrumentals, DARK SIDE takes elements from all of the band's previous albums and utilizes them here.  A lot of the sound effect work is rather famous, especially the interview snippits that engineer Alan Parsons and the band sprinkled throughout the album.  Paul McCartney was interviewed, but seasoned by years of media coverage, the band felt his answers were too guarded and not as off-the-cuff as they wanted.  The \\"I'm drunk\\" line was by Henry McCullough.  There's also a barely audible orchestral version of The Beatles \\"Ticket To Ride\\" that can be briefly heard at the end of \\"Eclipse\\".     Pink Floyd always had the potential to be not only great musicians and rock artists but also commercially.  But let's not kid ourselves.  Without DARK SIDE, they would not be the commercial juggernauts that they have become today.  Had they broke up with OBSCURED, today Pink Floyd would be one of those cult bands that a lot of people haven't heard of, but that those who do know them find them very interesting.    And that is why DARK SIDE is their definitive album, and one of the biggest selling albums ever.  It is here on DARK SIDE that Pink Floyd went from being beyond a cult band with some rather esoteric, rather impenetrable music, to being a very successful band with the same sonic identity, but more streamlined and much more accessible to the general pubic.                    (As far s the whole Dark Side of the Rainbow phenomena goes, where Wizard of Oz and the album syncs, apparently it is unintentional, or so the band claims.  Pretty bizaare how well they sync if indeed it is unintentional).

The house guests were playing this game I had never heard of which consisted of moving pawns from one end of a board to the other end, while their opponent was putting up fences to impede their progress. I became fascinated with the game and began searching all the local toy stores before finally finding it on Amazon.com.    I was very pleased with the quality and workmanship of the game. It took less than a minute to learn the rules, which are very simple. Simple rules, yet challenging game play.    This game has brought my family and friends many, many hours of enjoyment and I can't recommend it highly enough.

The stellar cast, humorous storyline, signature musical score and beautiful backdrop provide all the classic Leone we can handle to this shoot-em-up outlaw film. Harmonica and Cheyenne are the consumate outlaws we hate to love.   Instead of the good, the bad and the ugly, you get the lone wolf seeking revenge (Bronson), the gone bad but good at heart (Robards)and the very beautiful in Cardinale.

0895260131|3.0|Following upon the runaway success of its [[ASIN:0895260476 guide to American history]], Regnery Publishing decided to follow it with a guide to Islam, which fitted in with the paranoia about jihad taking over the West at the time.<br /><br />\\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades)\\" covers much the same territory as the author's former book [[ASIN:1893554589 Islam Unveiled]]. Having read about Muslims' own viewpoints of Islam through investigating the [[ASIN:0312270828 fatwa against Salman Rushdie]], Spencer both in [[ASIN:1893554589 Islam Unveiled]] and this book provides a clear corrective to people who seemed reasonable people when I first read them but are in fact apologists for Islam. His illustration of the amount of violence in the Qur'an is in fact something I knew of very well from reading my father's copy as a child, but Spencer's illustration of how Muslim theologians actually regard the most violent verses as overturning less violent ones is something quite new (to me) and shocking.<br /><br />His overview of the Crusades is essentially a repeat of [[ASIN:1893554589 Islam Unveiled]], though for those who read other aspects of the period's history it seems strangely incomplete and not looking at other events of the time like Christianisation of northern Europe. There is also a lot of repetitive ranting about how Muslim rulers' apparent tolerance of other religions resulted from them relaxing Sharia law: Spencer makes no effort to explain why they relaxed it or failed to follow it (or even why they ended such practices). In a similar vein is his explanation of how Islam wiped out Zoroastrianism and Nestorian Christianity consequent upon its eastward spread. This may be a good explanation; however, there are two glaring omissions in this context.<br /><br />The first is the absence of a chapter or two on the response of Hindu and Buddhist Asia to the spread of Islam. Given Spencer's statement that Hindu India is the only nation apart from the West that has successfully resisted jihad, this is surprising. The second is a discussion to the spread of Islam in southeast Asia between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. Given that Islam in southeast Asia is often quoted (despite the terrorism in Indonesia today) by many who deny that Islam is by nature intolerant and violent, this omission is all the more serious. Spencer also does consider that modernisation is already seriously weakening traditions in most Muslim nations today, so that some of his claims about the Islamic future of the West come off as too familiar.<br /><br />All in all, \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades)\\" does offer some remarkably obvious correctives to myths about Islam and the Qur'an, as well as some almost-terrifying revelations about Islam and its founder. Its tone is at times very ranty, however, and there are a number of facets of Islamic history that the book omits to mention.cessfully resisted jihad, this is surprising.

B000OCE0FK|4.0|Okay, I'll admit when I've been unfair to an album, and I've gotta say I've really been unfair to this one in the past. I despised every song but \\"Brilliant Disguise\\" when I first heard it. But it's a real grower. For one, I like how Springsteen weighs personal lyrics with pop hooks here, so both people who listen to music for the lyrics and the melodies can get something out of it. A lot of acts fail to do that while writing personal albums, but Springsteen had remarkable success. My favorite example of this is the title track. I'll admit I don't like the '80s production on it (the computerized guitar solo is my least favorite part), but he cooks up some tasty metaphors and milks the familiar chord progression for all it's worth. \\"Tougher Than the Rest\\"; \\"All that Heaven Will Allow\\", and especially \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", my favorite song on the record and one of my all-time top Springsteen picks, follow in this path. He also cooks up a surprisingly stellar country-rocker with \\"Spare Parts\\". Now, I'm still in firm denial this is anywhere near Born to Run -  \\"Cautious Man\\" is a noticeable lapse, \\"Walk Like a Man\\" is basically the same song; and \\"Two Faces\\" is a rare example of Springsteen making the '80s pop formula bad. For some reason, Bruce has always been quite potent when it comes to '80s pop - I never understood why, since I hate the sound coming from anyone else. I don't know, I guess it's just Bruce's thing? Anyway, \\"Two Faces\\" is a rare example of Bruce making the '80s pop thing suck (again, he would never do that anywhere else, and have you ever heard the Stones or Clapton, not to mention the \\"real\\" '80s pop stars - other than Prince, of course, because Prince rules -  try it? *Shudders*). I guess the folky \\"One Step Up\\" is nothing to faint over either, but it's got a good vibe. I like \\"When You're Alone\\", too. Strong vocal hook. Cool organ part. Distinct vocals. So I will now set my previous animosity with this record aside and give it a firm, solid thumbs up. And not the Australian \\"thumbs-up\\" (flipping the bird, in other words) - that's firmly reserved for Human Touch. No, I mean the American thumbs-up. Or the gladiator thumbs-up. Or whatever. My god, when I ramble, I ramble!up. And not the Australian \\"thumbs-up\\" (flipping the bird, in other words) - that's firmly reserved for Human Touch. No, I mean the American thumbs-up.

0684865130|5.0|It seems most criticism of this book on the site asserts claims of dull repetitiveness and trite anti-war arguments.  Even Yossarian however admits that the war against Germany had to be fought (of course to know this you would have had to get past the first hundred pages as so few of the critics have).   The book is about capitalism, relationships, friendship, duty, service, love and the eternal paradox inherent in each.  There is something human in this book that touches us as the reader in the depths of their humanity and throws us naked from the tree of knowledge (and good and evil too!) into the world around us.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|At first I was a bit confused with some of the songs and their sound; this album has some new sounds for Springsteen.  But after several listens I have to say that I LOVE it and can't wait to hear to songs live.  The music is definitely a stretch into something new for Bruce but the lyrics are typically insightful and profound in the manner Springsteen fans expect.    There is a definitely Pet Sounds feel to the production on several of the songs.  It came as QUITE a surprise after hearing the rocking nature of \\"Radio Nowhere\\".  A lot of the songs have a very pop feel about them in a way we've not heard since Born in the USA.  As on that album, the light sound and sheen of the production belie the darkness of the lyrics.      As for those who are complaining about the production values and the muddled sound, get a new stereo.  If you're still Born to Run on an 8-track, it's time to upgrade.  I've been listening to this on Sony ES system with Infinity speakers and on my iPod with a pair of Ultimate Ears super.fi pro 5's and it sounds awesome.  So those who are griping about the production either have poor equipment or hearing.
0719062683|5.0|Whenever a college student takes that required first course in critical theory, that student ought to realize that this course is admittedly dense in both content and style, and as a consequence should have access to supplemental readings.  Peter Barry with his BEGINNING THEORY is one of three such useful texts.  Lois Tyson and Charles Bressler are the other two noteworthy introductory tomes.  What is helpful in Barry is his initial chapter on \\"Theory before `theory'--liberal humanism.\\"  Most other critical texts scant the reader on the state of criticism as it existed before Jacques Derrida took the podium in 1966 and shook up the academic world by suggesting that the neat and tidy world of the liberal humanists was founded on a heavy-handed patriarchy that took for granted a spectrum of Western-based assumptions that had stood unchallenged since Plato.  These liberal humanists have been on the run since then and Barry succinctly summarizes and analyzes who the major players were in this seismic eruption.<br /><br /> Barry structures his analyses of each school with a general historical overview of that school's paradigmatic assumptions.  He includes what critics of that school generally think about as they ponder how to relate the intricacies of that school to specified literary texts. This listing is more useful than the uninitiated might think since when it comes time for the novice critic to make that transcendental leap from the abstruseness that is theory to the concrete reality that is text that neophyte must understand a plethora of assumptions that all too often get lost in the French translation but are clarified in Barry's capable hands.  One example will do.  Jacques Lacan is notorious for being dense and just plain hard to understand, but when Barry connects the denseness that is Lacan to the clarity that is Poe in his \\"The Purloined Letter,\\" the various stages of self that seem muddled in the former now stand etched in clear relief by the latter.<br /><br /> One minor note: Barry closes his text with considerations of Stylistics, Narratology, and Ecocriticism, none of which have yet hit the mainstream as accepted modes of literary discourse.  Still, for the eager undergraduate or the uneasy graduate student, Barry belongs on the same shelf that also houses Lois Tyson and Charles Bressler.or note: Barry closes his text with considerations of Stylistics, Narratology, and Ecocriticism, none of which have yet hit the mainstream as accepted modes of literary discourse.

There's no spark, no fire, no drive on display here. Don't even get me started on that cover-art or the song \\"Dirty Little Rock Star\\" which both scream Middle Age Out-of-Touch.<br /><br />I will continue to look forward to Cult releases and try to block this one out of my head, it pretty much sucks.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I like this CD. Its got some cool songs and some weird ones, but I still listen to it.
B00005JPGO|2.0|You've got the handsome male, think DiCaprio, you've got the plain girl - tough, articulate, uses profanity, and says things like, \\"you better get out of my face\\" - you've got the crying Africans, the greedy businessmen, a love interest, and a tragic death carried by cell phone 3,000 miles away. Now wouldn't you bank roll a film like that? I am a big fan of DiCaprio, pegging him as the best actor of his generation since his breakout performance in \\"Gilbert Grape,\\"  and I rather like the work of Zwick, whose \\"Glory\\" was great and his \\"Samurai,\\" worth seeing, but this film is pure silliness as far as I am concerned, a sentimental piece of nonsense, made memorable by a stand out performance by DiCaprio who continues to grow, although I think it is sad to see him wasted on this sort of action film more suited to Danny Devito and or Mr. Stallone, ha, ha. The set-up is reminiscent of the recent Bond flick, with the so-called hard-as-nails chick who talks Vassar-tough, but melts the minute \\"her man\\" starts shooting Africans. After that, there is no holding her back. In one gripping scene, she gives him her phone number.  She doesn't approve of diamond sales, but she loves the smell of napalm in the morning. Meanwhile, back at the Ritz, where the good guys hang out...
B000VK99Z6|4.0|I had bypassed this title many times thinking it was a typical low budget British comedy and I'd just wait until it came out on cable for free. When it was online for .99 cents, I decided to kill a Saturday afternoon and rented this. I was not expecting this movie to be as funny as it was nor did I expect it to be so well made. The acting was good, the actions scenes fun and I especially liked the way they edited it to flash 4 or 6 pictures in a row to quickly move ahead the story point. That technique condensed several probably boring (but necessary to the plot) scenes into a few seconds and got us right back into the action. I'd gladly watch it again.
B000UR366S|5.0|What can I say that everyone has said already? Its a wonderful CD! I was so excited to have Joni singing again! With all the \\"greatist hits\\" stuff coming out,I thought for sure no hope for some GREAT new material. I bought this on the road. Listening to the sax parts, I thought for sure it was Shorter, but it was not. Its veteran Bob Sheppard. He sounds exactly like Shorter. Of course ,my man Larry Klein on bass (Joni's ex). A lot of songs were done by Joni,as she does ,what she does best,branching out into the real world of music. As I was driving I do what I always do when listening to Joni, let it play again and again. Every time I heard something different,remarkable. On some songs has that feel of \\"Chalk \\" Cd. But ever refreshing. Her new take on Big Yellow Taxi is great! So I will stop and let you decide how it is. What a remarkable lady.. She creates memories for me everytime, this time doing a roadtrip and stopping in for coffee and seeing her new CD! Please buy this and listen to it many times over,just as we were doing on her other great projects!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I haven't been this excited for a new Springsteen album in a long time (did I just write album?) My first album (there I did it again!)I ever recieved for Christmas was the River. I rolled through his music over the years, wearing out Born to run, Born in the USA and Tunnel of Love and the Rising. To be truthful here I like Bruce when he is backed by the E-Street band. E Street is family, the dirty Uncle, the drunk Aunt the doting grandmother - nostalgic youth that I hear in remnants in his new songs.    Magic sounds full, there is depth. There are pounding guitars, pounding drums and swirling sax and then it slows and Bruce's voice carries. Bruce really sings on several songs like \\"Girls in Summer Clothes,\\" \\"I'll Work for your Love\\" - he comfortably reaches notes outside of his normal range.    The songs that resonate with me are \\"You'll be Coming Home,\\"Long Walk Home,\\"Your Own Worst Enemy\\" and \\"Magic.\\"    There will will always be critics on Bruce's past direction, Nebraska, Ghost of Tom Joad - the Peter Seger Sessions. But bruce could just stop performing all together. And poof  like \\"Magic\\" he would just dissapear.     Let him sing...    I am really enjoying this album and can't wait to see it performed live!
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|All I can say after listening to this cd for a couple of days is \\"wow\\". It seems every track keeps getting better and better with each listen. I simply love \\"Dark Road\\", the first single from this album. It actually moved me to tears and I still get chills listening to it. Other standout tracks include; \\"Smithereens\\", \\"Ghosts in My Machine\\", \\"Womankind\\" and \\"Fingernail Moon\\". Simply amazing! Great Album! Highly Recommended!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce is like fine wine, he just keeps getting better with age!     Growing up in Central Jersey (near Highway 9) and then college in West Long Branch, right next door to Asbury Park, I am always reminded of home when I hear Bruce's music. It's tough, gritty Jersey music, with a \\"Baby Boomer's\\" moral conscience. I hear and understand his frustration with \\"Is there anybody alive out there?\\", I ask that question myself on almost a daily basis. Bruce is our collective moral compass there to remind us of the path from which we've strayed.     Great job Boss! Lookin forward to seeing you in concert in Cleveland next month!
0375846735|5.0|The Golden Compass, and its 2 sequels (The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) is a story featuring profound concepts, displaying the most original creativity in characters & and in plot, and  a \\"can't put it down\\" story line, that can be understood and appreciated by people of all ages.  I am reading all three for the 2nd time, and I have enjoyed it more even than the first read through.  I am a youthful 72 year old, and I would recommend this Trilogy to anyone I am related to, regardless of age.  I also these books would inspire new writers.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Every time I watch this movie, my face hurts.  There are the lines I listen for so that I can fall in the floor again- Walter's \\"You want a toe?  I can get you a toe\\" and \\"You ever hear of a little show called Branded?\\" knock me out every time... Dude's \\"It's like Lenin said, you look for the person who will benefit, and, ahhhhhhhhh\\" and, to that, Donnie's \\"I am the Walrus.\\"  Shut the xxxx up, Donnie.  Her life is in your hands.
B000TGCR3I|2.0|Rather than try and write a long review explaining point by point why I thought what I did about this movie I'm going to be short and to the point. TekkonKinkreet was a visually a beautiful movie and also incredibly boring. I sat through the entire thing in hopes that it was going to get better however it never happened. I'm surprised by all the positive buzz surrounding this film. Im sure others will praise it but for me it was a snoozefest.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|great order experience.  Prelisten if you can to this album first though as it might not be for everyone.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I hadn't seen Daniel Craig in much before and at first I didn't think he seemed to have the polish of the earlier bonds, but I was wrong.  He has polish, but not too much like the other Bonds.    I really like the direction they've taken with the new Bond.  Although the Pierce Bronson version was more serious than some of the others this latest James Bond comes across as no nonsense and seems a lot more the way you'd think a special service agent for any country might be.  Not that I didn't enjoy being entertained by the earlier Bonds, but I think it's time to have less bells and whistles than some of the earlier Bonds.    If you like Bond, then you most definitely will want to add this movie to your collection.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|Bruce, I love ya but after listening to the first four tracks of Magic my response is a resounding \\"What he say?\\". The sound was so muffled I could not make out the lyrics. I thought I had purchased a bad bootleg. Target can keep my $14 just promise me to remix it. Fast. I have a 1978 Un-Concert on cassette that has better sound definition. I know there is a great album in there somewhere. Please remaster. This CD could have been your best since Tunnel of Love.
1400064287|5.0|It's all in the details. Well worth the investment - especially if you need to make your message 'stick.'
B000E33VWW|3.0|I'd never gotten to see \\"Capote\\" when it was in release, so I checked out the DVD from the local library. I think this is the way to see this chilly and internal movie. If anything, you can take a break when the excruciatingly slow pace causes moss to grow on your chair.    The story  shows how Capote--a tormented, freakish Southern writer living in New York off praise and recognition--destroys whatever soul he possesses when he writes \\"In Cold Blood.\\" He lies to himself and everyone else, he cajoles and betrays, he whines and deceives, he hurts his friend, his lover, and the two poor jerks who got themselves hanged after many stays of execution. It's become de rigeuer to paint the killers, especially Perry Smith, sympathetically, and this Prime Directive is followed here, though the focus is on Capote's unraveling.    The film is masterfully made on every level, and the problem is that you are always aware of it. Adam Kimmel's cinematography is like a series of exquisite photographs in an autumnal palette of gold, yellow, rust, and black. Dan Futterman's screenplay is brilliant, witty, and so controlled it's almost anal-retentive. The acting is subtle and superb down to each individual prison guard. Yet I was never able to live in this movie or feel for the characters.    A big stumbling block was Philip Seymour Hoffman's tour de force as Truman Capote. Possibly this won't be a problem for younger viewers, who don't have indelible memories of the real Capote on Johnny Carson. Hoffman inhabits Capote with ferocious fidelity. He has Capote down to every quiver of the lip, every fey swish of the hand, every self-satisfied snicker. I wanted to feel Capote's torment as his love for Perry Smith battled with his need to have the man die so that Capote could finish his book, but I couldn't feel anything because I was so busy being amazed by Hoffman's exquisite acting. The same was true for Clifton Collins Jr.'s Perry--I could hear the wheels turning each time he lifted hischin or made his mouth tremble. Chris Cooper and Catherine Keener were exceptions, both natural and unaffected. Speaking of Catherine Keener I got a kick out of seeing that Harper Lee was a cigarette-smoking, sharp-tongued cookie. I'd always imagined the author of \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" as a starched old Southern lady.    On the DVD docs, director Bennett Miller and cinematographer Adam Kimmel remember waiting hours for a distant freight train to bisect the bleak Kansas plain so they could get a moody shot. They got lots of moody shots--wheat waving, the Clutter house exterior, looming storm clouds--and didn't cut one of them. It isn't enough that Truman looks with wonderment at Perry, he looks endlessly. The scenes are all brief--sometimes just a reaction beat--but everyone seems to be moving through Jell-O. Miller could have cut the hour and fifty-four minutes to a crisp 95 minutes without sacrificing any of the mood.    This is a \\"fine\\" film (much too self-important to be called a \\"movie\\") but after sitting through it, I felt empty and in need of a good Bruckheimer flick to suck me in.
B000026OW3|4.0|bought this for my five year old  grand daughter who is a grand champion of chopin.  she loaded it on her  bedside  ipod and things it is great.
B000AY807Q|5.0|A must buy.  Neil Young is an enduring classic and if you've enjoyed his folk rock over the years, you will certainly mellow out when you listen to his latest CD.  \\"Just a Dream\\" is especially good listening.
1592332803|5.0|As yet another chronic purchaser of vegan cookbooks, I can tell you that - of all the strengths in this book - the best thing is that it doubles an an encyclopedia and a dictionary to just about All Things Vegan. The extra time, effort and space the author gives to providing the reader with these extensive vegan resources, multiple appendices, glossary of terms, etc. means I don't have to put the book down to find another source  ... it's all there and provided in an incredibly user-friendly format.     Colleen Patrick-Goudreau educates not only on vegan baking, but WHY people should choose to bake in this way. Being a successful vegan baker has been made as easy as following a simple recipe. And trust me, I have children who don't think twice about telling me when something from my kitchen doesn't taste good. I'm BLOWING THEIR MINDS right now.    I had a mean family member once tell me, \\"You can cook, but you just can't bake.\\" ... hahahaha - look at me now, Aunt Marny!
B000N6U0E2|4.0|Will Smith gives an awesome performance - again.  I'd have voted for him for the oscar.  However, with all the bad things that happen to his character throughout the entire movie, the brief couple of minutes of \\"happyness\\" at the end, when the character of \\"Chris\\" finally achieves success, are just not enough to leave this reviewer with any \\"feel good\\" memories of this film.  I felt completely beat up (as, I'm sure, did Chris Gardner) the entire time and the ending did nothing to relieve that.  I did cry alot though, which testifies of superior acting and screenwriting to me.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|\\"Is there anybody alive out there?\\"  sings Bruce Springsteen in the opening song, \\"Radio Nowhere.\\"  A question, by the way, he often asks in concert.  The answer has to be that Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band are alive and rocking once again, and we are all better because of it.   \\"Magic\\" is a fine album, one that deserves to be savored, bringing Mr. Springsteen and the E Street Band back in form close to their glory days.      The music is different from his pervious albums--all of his albums sound differently--but this one resembles most the musical production in \\"The River\\" and \\"Darkness On The Edge Of Town.\\"   \\"Magic\\" allows the faithful to feel again the full force of the E Streeters:  Clarence Clemon's sax solos, the nifty guitar work of Little Stevie Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren, and Roy Bittan's inviting piano openings.  Mr. Springsteen has the band amped up in a different direction in \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" sounding like early-80s REM, but most of the album is vintage E Street.       There are no masterpiece songs on the album in the category of \\"Thunder Road,\\" \\"Badlands,\\" or \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", but there are twelve very good songs, including a song that doesn't appear on the cover paying tribute to Mr. Springsteen's friend, Terry Magovern, who recently passed away.       Like a Sam Shepard play, everyone can read into the lyrics what they want.  For me this album charts the mood swings of the country from 9-11 to today.  \\"The Rising\\" captured the resolve and sadness the country felt after 9-11;  \\"Magic\\" takes a look at the current spell that has been cast upon the country, now engaged in two wars and the home citizenry  seemingly largely disconnected and disinterested in the war effort.    Mr. Springsteen, perhaps recognizing his advancing age, turns introspective in  \\"Girl in Their Summer Clothes\\", which shows that the quickest way for an older man to feel his age is to be ignored by younger women who once may have given him the eye.   A dig at superficial beauties in \\"You'll be Comin' Down\\"  and the exploration of romantic pledges in \\"I'll Work For Your Love\\" are solid additions to the Springsteen songbook, but I prefer when he looks beyond to the country at-large.         \\"Radio Nowhere\\" may be the best anti-corporate radio song since Elvis Costello's \\"Radio, Radio\\" or it may be much more, a musical version of T.S. Eliot's \\"The Waste Land.\\"  Is Mr. Springsteen   imploring the county to wake up from a long sleep, end the all-to-common complacency, and rediscover our core American values?   In \\"Last to Die,\\" borrowing a line from Senator John Kerry, \\"a voice from long ago,\\" upon his return from Vietnam, Mr. Springsteen asks,  \\"Who'll be the last to die for a mistake?\\"       A father in \\"Long Walk Home\\" reminds his son, perhaps going off to war, that the flag flying near the courthouse, means that \\"certain things are set in stone;   Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't.\\"   In a time when our liberties appear to be diminishing before our eyes,  Mr. Springsteen reminds that us we have certain bedrock principles--the rule of law, respect for individual rights, and equal treatment under law--that we don't compromise even during wartime.      Written from the perspective of the wife of an injured soldier at a veteran's hospital, in \\"Devil's Arcade\\" we see how the soldier--perhaps the same solider in \\"Devils and Dust\\" who had his finger on the trigger and faced a moral crisis--draws strength from his wife's heart and faith.      Finally, in the title track, \\"Magic,\\" Mr. Springsteen lets us know were this can all end if we don't start telling the truth and living by it.   The freedoms we too often take for granted will go \\"drifin' like ghost amongst the trees;  This is what will be.\\"      Mr. Springsteen's place in American popular music culture has long been secured well before \\"Magic.\\"   He belongs in the pantheon of titans--with Sinatra, Presley,  Dylan, and Cash.   Where will he rank when his career ends?  BehindSinatra and Presley, but ahead of Dylan and Cash?  No matter where he ends up, \\"Magic\\" is a strong work, a worthy addition to his legacy.
B000002MY3|5.0|I've been reading books and listening to albums that I first encountered in the last five to ten years ago, and seeing what my adult self makes of them now.  This CD was one of my favorites when it first came out, and it's still a favorite now, years later.  Alanis has the ability to carve out deep emotion in her songs, raw and lyrical at the same time.  I've never listened to an album as angry as this one that also charms and wins you over to the musician at the same time.  I think it's because it's a righteous anger album, and not whiny or petty.  The things that anger Alanis in this album are things that anger all of us at different points in our life, and that is why we can relate and why this album is universal.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|\\"Bringing up Baby\\" is one of the funniest movies of all time.  If you look \\"screwball comedy\\" up in the dictionary you'll find this film.  It is an excellent example of a comedy of errors.  Both Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are wonderful in this movie.  Their comedic timing is superb.  This is a movie you can watch over and over, year after year and still enjoy it.  One caution: you will laugh so hard it hurts - but it's a good hurt.
B00005JPTA|5.0|Director David Cronenberg follows up his notable flick, \\"A History of Violence\\" with a well edited tale of the London based Russian mafia, \\"Eastern Promises\\".  Shot around the streets of London, this dark and gloomily filmed movie gives off an air of danger and foreboding.<br /><br />The film commences as a young 14 year old pregnant Russian girl is rushed to the hospital where Naomi Watts playing Russian American Anna Khitrova works as a midwife.  The girl dies delivering a baby girl leaving behind a diary that when translated tells a pathetic story of rape, drugs and forced prostitution.  A business card in her possesion leads Watts to the Trans Siberian restaurant, headquarters of vory v zakone (mafia) boss Semyon played by venerable actor Armin Mueller-Stahl.<br /><br />Working for Stahl as an enforcer and driver is Nikolai Luzhin played superbly by Viggo Mortensen.  Mortensen expertly gives the aura of a tough, remorseless criminal never losing his authentic sounding accent throughout the film.  He is also the watchdog over Stahl's unstable son Kirill played by Vincent Cassel.  The heavily tattooed Mortensen does most of the heavy lifting for this mob but takes a liking to Watts who is drawn to Stahl as he coaxes her to allow him to translate the diary.  Stahl, all the while wishes to destroy the evidence of his dastardly deeds chronicled within those pages.<br /><br />The movie plays out with Watts and her family trying to protect the baby while Mortensen and Cassel carry out their criminal duties for their boss.  The movie contains many graphic displays of violence and bloody gore particularly in a sauna bath knife fighting scene which Mortensen plays in the buff.<br /><br />The not totally expected conclusion ties a nice bow around a supenseful and revealing film that had few if any dull moments featuring a well directed cast with succinct and purposeful dialogue and action.
B0000035E7|4.0|This is Nirvana's first album, and in many ways a forgotten one, forever overshadowed by the landmark Nevermind. It's not my favorite from them, however it's a great first effort that shows the energy of the band. It's certainly not as melodic or polished as Nevermind, instead it's loud and raw. Favorites from this record include About a Girl, Love Buzz, School and Downer. It's definetely worth checking out.
B00005JPQL|4.0|This has to be the best film released so far this year.  A vast majority of the films that have come out in the last few years have either been sequels or remakes, and I was really glad to see a good and original story hit the theaters (even if it was a book adaptation).  For those of you comparing it to the Princess Bride, STOP!  The only reason that it could be compared with that film is the fact that they are both in the fantasy genre and aren't run-of-the-mill films.  This was a great film and in my opinion is worth your time and money!
B000URDEB0|5.0|I was not sure what to expect, I bought the DVD/CD set \\"End of an Era\\", and was wondering how Nightwish could top this after Tarja left. I had heard a few of the cuts from this album (Eva & Amaranth). When i bought this album, I was blown away. In my opinion, \\"Meadows of Heaven\\" is going to be the sleeper hit of this album. I sincerely hope Nightwish releases a video of this track.   All the tracks are keepers. I am looking forward to seeing Nightwish in concert soon, and hope they play a lot of songs from this album, as well as some old ones. This album is a must buy for any Nightwish fan.
B000V4UFZK|3.0|I love Poltergeist. It has always been a supercreepy movie, which I really happen to enjoy. This new 25th Anniversary edition looks to be great. I wish it had the original theatrical trailer a cast (what's left of them) commentary, the making of that they used to show all the time, but oh well. I still recommend this edtion.
0807014273|5.0|Read the book for my Philo I class and found it very interesting and certainly shed some light to our class topic about Nihilism.  It is a very easy read, so I would recommend it to Philo students.  For my purpose it is an appropriate read.
0316067598|5.0|An extremely well written book which tells a story everyone in the US should read. As a former military person I can understand the concepts but was amazed at the dedication of these men and their dpendence on each other. Non-military people should read this book not only because of its message but also to show how easy we have it and how much we owe these people. Again, an excellent read.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I am very pleased that Ms. Bailey Rae sings out of pure heart[[ASIN:B000HBK3MM Corinne Bailey Rae]] and does not see her body as means for selling her music.  I heard her song \\"Trouble Sleeping\\", on the radio, and thought an angel was singing.  I have heard her interviews and like the way she presents herself.  Though young, North Americans like Beyonce could learn a lot from her.  The songs and messages of hope and saintliness are what's needed.  Bodies girating with tattoo's and naked promotes dirty countries. All of her songs are easy to listen to and one feels clean or cleansed while and after listening, this one. Thanks for the PURITY Corinne.
1594489505|5.0|For me, 1000 Splendid Suns was touching, realistic and timely. The characters provoked a whole array of emotions.  Once again, we learn that war is repetitive, its intent being material strategy and gain.  What havoc it wrecks to individual families and the world!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I bought this cd after I watched the documetary on how the Martins put the work together.  When I got it, I couldn't wait to get it into the cd player - I cried! It is amazing! There are no words for music that takes you back to the days long ago, where you can actually smell the breeze coming in the window as you sit by your record player playing your very first Beatles Album (yes Album!). Magical is all that comes to mind - Bravo!!!!!
1416523359|5.0|A review by Seth Kerin, author of [[ASIN:1590923286 The Elder Worlds: Book One]] and [[ASIN:1590922050 The Continuum]]<br /><br />Lisey's Story, by Stephen King, is one of his best novels yet. Don't get me wrong - I am a great fan of The Dark Tower Series, The Stand, and other King classics, but this one is probably his most literary work to date, and really delves deeply into the relationship between a writer and his wife. This novel is more about the character and how she develops than about the dark thing that goes bump in the night.<br /><br />That is not to say there aren't classic King scares in the novel, and it certainly ramps up the tension in several key areas of the story.<br /><br />What I liked most about the book was his portrayal of the writer's world that he escapes to on several occasions, even bringing Lisey herself there. As a writer, I can relate to that concept of a place that is at once an escape, and also a potential trap. When you go down that path, sometimes you don't want to leave. Sometimes you don't want to go back to the real world.<br /><br />You won't want to put Lisey's Story down.
0312995423|1.0|It is unbelievable that the author od Da Vinci Code can write such a weak novel. It is based on a super computer at NSA which is challenged by an ex employee. There are too many coincidences. Who can believe that deputy director of NSA would dispatch a language professor for a super secret mission. There are technical inaccuracies about computer. It shows how a computer operations manager ignores warnings repeateadly.     If I had read this before reading Da Vinci Code, and if I hadn't heard about or seen that movie, I would not have read Da Vinci Code.    Like someone said in his comment that he read this novel only because it was by Dan Brown. That is why I finished it too.    I have Dan Brown's Deception Point next on my list, but now I am hesitant.
B000UJBYD8|2.0|Being a Cult fan since 1985 when Love came out and the sound was raw, hooky psychodelic rock it changed my way of listening to music back then.  Before that point I was into Depeche mode, The Cure, Siouxsie and the banshees and Simple minds.  This album transitioned me to more interesting british rock like The Mission, The Sisters of mercy and The Fields of the Nephilim.  Anyway I felt the transition to Electric was right, then the sound layering of the rock arena album Sonic Temple, then the Sonic/Electric hybrid sound of Ceromony I understood where they were going and why.  When the self titled \\"the cult\\" was released also known as the black sheep album (due to the cd cover) I felt the sound was too uncult it had catchy tunes like coming down and black sun the rest of the album was forgettable. Beyond Good and Evil was a return to Ceremony era.  I felt it was a strong album after a 6 year hiatus. (besides the box set the 2 best of albums and the pure cult dvd) it was as well forgettable.  Now 6 years later we get Born into this well, after the first listen I was disappointed not because the songs weren't strong as I hoped but it reminded me how I felt about the last 2 albums from the cult I try to compare this album with the likes of Love, Electric, Sonic and Ceremony and it doesn't compare.  Billy's guitar work is more rhythm than lead.  Dirty little rockstar is catchy and a good single.  Holy Mountain is a \\"wtf\\" is this?  I'm still trying to take it in  I just received it today so I was excited about the new cd but disappointed in the music.  I was hoping for more [[ASIN:B00002MTRG Coloursound]] style (Billy's side project in 99' with Mike Peters of the Alarm, Scott Garrett of the cult, [[ASIN:B000008IVR Neverland]] and The Mission [[ASIN:B000PKG716 God Is a Bullet]] and Craig Adams of the sisters of mercy[[ASIN:B000002HBT A Slight Case Of Overbombing (Greatest Hits Vol. 1)]] and The Mission) if you haven't heard this album you need to!  This album is definitivecult in every sense without Ian.  Good Solo work by Billy and amazing bass hooks by Craig.  Anyway I will listen to Born into this more and might write a follow up review but for right now this album is s**t compared to classic cult.
B000UFAURI|5.0|despite what people are saying this album really showcases dave's musical tallent.    real musicians will appreciate the musicallity of this album its some of the best work the foo fighter ever made. It's typical foo fighters with a twist of genius. this cd was well written. a classic!     if you are a fan of music then don't waste any more time, grab this cd now.  if you're not a fan of music i still suggest u pick it up.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an outstanding musical.  In my opinion the best in recent years.  It is enjoyable by the whole family.  My kids still love to sing the songs months after seeing the musical.  Avenue Q won the Tony but it will quickly fade from memory.  I believe that Wicked will live on for decades.  My highest recommendation for the musical and the recording.
B000QUCNOK|2.0|I was eager to see another film directed by Tykwer since Run Lola Run is one of my all-time favourite films. This film has many great points: the cinematography is stunning in showing both squalor and beauty, the premise is an interesting one, and the supporting characters played by Hoffman and Rickman were spirited. However, despite these elements, the film was remarkably unmoving. It is diffucult to convey scent through images, and though the visuals were vibrant, enlivening scent through a non-olfactory medium is better done with words and a reader's imagination (I hear the book is great for this) rather than through pictures. (Scent directly and chemically affects the brain, but watching TV/movies puts our brains in a lull, sometimes deeper than sleep, so the medium works against its goal.) Ben Whishaw (playing Grenouille, \\"Frog\\" in English), though very handsome, does little to carry the main role; his range of emotions (though lauded by the director and producer in the speacial features bit) goes from bland to slighly blander. Since we are following HIS story, I'd like to feel more about him, whether admiration, disgust, empathy or hatred. But I feel nothing.<br /><br />In addition, the ending leaves a lot to be desired (spoiler coming). Everyone swooning and getting into scent-induced orgies over this \\"dead-girl\\" perfume? When did magical realism waltz its way into the film? That leap made me go from kind of liking the movie to really disliking it. If the audience is to suspend belief (when \\"magic\\" or supernatural wonders appear), this must be introduced earlier in the film. Otherwise it's like seeing a a war flick where a unicorn carries off a soldier in danger. Whishaw's character kills twelve or thirteen innocent women, so I wanted to see a just punishment for him. Having him essentially take his own life, not out of remorse but rather because he could never \\"love or be loved like another human being\\" makes me feel unsettled and cheated. LAck of love and depth of feeling is a sensible reason to kill oneself, but where does this angst come from? We only see one other scene hinting at him discovering an inner void (when he discovers he has no scent), but his discovery makes him want to show the world that he is special and important through his work, *not* making him want to become whole, emotionally fulfilled human. If he's to kill himself because he's vacant inside, we need to see more of him feeling his emptiness. All during the film he seems content to find comfort and obsessive joy in his work. A narrator voiceover and a flashback to an imagined scene of tenderness with his first murder victim is a sloppy, slap-dash way of showing this motivation.<br /><br />In all, I think this movie has a great beginning, but the last fifteen or twenty minutes completely spoil the film.feeling is a sensible reason to kill oneself, but where does this angst come from?

B000UR366S|5.0|There's a promotional video on youtube where Joni discusses the making of this album.  There's something mesmerizing about seeing/hearing her talk about this project.  Joni's best albums are the ones that were close to what was going on in her heart at the time.  With Shine, her heart is breaking for what we have done to this planet and for what we are doing to each other in the name of some God.  Like most of us, she's struggling with the feeling of hopelessness any rational person would feel while keeping an eye out for some glimmer of hope any irrational person would cling to.  Art is not the end product, it's a testimony to the search.  Thank you Joni for sharing your search with us.
B0000683DH|5.0|Ever Since I saw the press for this, I have been meaning to get the version here.As for the rating, if this is the Directors cut, then there is no way this should be PG-13;Personally I would like to see more options in these genres for unrated( especially when Adults make the principle purchase).That having been said, I still think that this film is very family friendly, even more so than most news casts.  I suspect that most people buying this will know the story, however some may not know that some edits were made, and this cut restores some.Anyways, the film has the most amazingly great audio and video.In 5.1 this film is superb.from start to finish this is a great ride.Wether you have never seen this film before, or if you are wanting the collectors cut, this is a gem.  THE DVD.  The Commentary.I am always ambivalent about Nicholas Meyers' commentary, however here he has come as close as he seems able to come to a balanced commentary, that is... informative and entertaining.The Second disc extras are great...a bit conflicting ( Shatner now compared to Shatner in 82 with his Attitude about the plot points), and the coverage of the Star Trek Universe... well, I guess Hard Core Trekkies wedge in some-how, and I could care less about that part of the bonus, but thankfully the WRATH OF KHAN is overall a great collection. Hopefully I can complete my set of these DVDs before  the series sells out.
B000K15VSA|4.0|Fundamentally, it's a digitally cleaned up \\"Director's Cut\\" with insubstantial changes.  I was extremely disappointed since Scott had gone on for years about working on his definitive version.  Now I've seen it and it's not a great departure from what's already available.    Don't get me wrong, I love the movie.  I saw it during its initial run and since then, it's been one of my all-time faves.  What I can't stand is hype.  I'm thinking of canceling my pre-order of this 5-disc set since I can't afford to waste any money on supposedly different \\"versions\\" of the film with only subatomic-level differences.    Giving it 4 stars for the film itself, but it should be more like 3.5 for the failure of this new version to deliver on the build-up.
B000T5O48U|5.0|I have waited a looooooong time to see this film get the special treatment it deserved.  For years, the only way I had to view this classic horror treat was on an old DVD release with cropped edges, horrible picture, and NO special features at all.....not to mention the ugliest DVD artwork ever for a Stephen King release.<br /><br />Lionsgate has now given us Cujo as it has never been seen on home video.  I was blown away by how clear the picture is, and how vibrant the colors are.  The old transfer just seemed washed out and faded.  I watched this on my PS3, which upscales it to hi-def, and I never dreamed this film could ever look this good.  I'm also glad that there was no effort to try to create a surround sound track for this film, since most of it takes place inside a car.  You have the choice of watching it in the original mono, or a 2 channel stereo mix.  While this is not a film I would choose to show off my surround system, it is very effective for what is happening on screen.  Not only do we get treated to a remastered copy of the film, but Cujo also has some really good special features.  The 3-part documentary runs about 45 min. total, and is very informative about the way the film was made.  Both Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro take part in the documentary.  The director, Lewis Teague, also provides a good commentary track.  I only have two minor complaints:  1st, there is no trailer for Cujo and 2nd, with it being the 25th anniversary edition, I would rather have seen the artwork from the original movie poster as the cover.  I'm not complaining too much about the artwork since it is a huge improvement over the previous version, I just think the poster with the white picket fence and the word \\"Cujo\\" in blood was a great poster.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you own the original DVD version of Cujo, put it in the doghouse.  You will be glad you upgraded to this fantastic version of what I think is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work on film.<br /><br />2013 Blu ray UPDATE:<br /><br />I just got my new copy of Cujo in the mail, and thought I would add this to my previous DVD review.<br />Of course, the one thing you want to know; is this worthy of a double dip??  Well, that depends on how much you like this movie.  I'll break it down into a list of pros and cons, then you can make your own decision.<br /><br />PROS<br />  *  FINALLY, we get cover art from the original movie poster.  This packaging is AWESOME!!!  Original artwork is also reflected on the disc itself.<br />  *  New commentary from director Lewis Teague.  This is a really entertaining track.<br />  *  Sound seems to be remastered.<br />  *  When I saw the video of the 25th anniv. of Cujo, I thought it couldn't get better.  I have to admit that I was wrong.  This is the best Cujo has ever looked!!!  The HD transfer has obviously been remastered<br />  since the 25th anniv. edition.  The picture looks gorgeous!!!!<br />  *  On-screen menu also uses original poster artwork.<br /><br />CONS<br />  *  No other extras included other than commentary<br />  *  Price is a little high for a bare bones movie.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  In the case of the new 30th anniv. edition of this film, it really comes down to how much you're willing to pay for a new commentary track and some awesome artwork. If you do decide to double dip on this one, I would definitely save the previous 25th anniv. edition.

0142407380|5.0|Last year my son bought the first 5 books in this series from the school book order.  This last month, I finally read the whole series.  He bought this book this summer.  I love the spy and all that stuff, I am a fan of the Bourne movies, I tried reading the books, but there were too many swear words.  So now these books.  I love them, they are action packed have you at the edge of your seat and I can say that it doesn't bother me that my ten year old son keeps reading them over and over.  It is fun to read the same things that your kids love and love it so much your self.  I am addicted to this series.  This book was great on it's own, you don't need the whole series for back ground.  But reading them all is so much fun.
0743277708|5.0|\\"Watership Down\\" by Richard Adams is that greatest of rarities, an adult fairy tale that works.  It is about a group of young rabbits searching for a new home.    Hazel is convinced his brother Fivers visions of doom are true.  Fiver was the smallest of heir litter but he is blessed with god sense and clairvoyance.  They convince Bigwig, a member of their warrens Owsla (security patrol), of their concerns.  They are brought to the chief rabbit who calmly dismisses their concerns and privately chews Bigwig out.     Hazel is not to be dismissed lightly.  He is utterly convinced of Fivers prediction. Being intrepid and resourceful he has faith in his judgment.  He recruits others (including Bigwig) to their cause and arranges an escape.  Fiver has a vision of where they should go. It is for this haven, they leave all that they know.    This is a rabbit's world with rabbits view.  Frith is their god.  El-ahairah is the hero of their mythology.  He is the Prince of a Thousand Enemies.  The tales of his adventures give demonstrate to other rabbits the skills necessary for their survival.  Dogs are idiots and cats are sadistic. Man is shown as being indifferent, sometimes cruel and always impersonal to the affairs of rabbitkind.       This is a classic journey story.  Of course they encounter dangers and setbacks.  As they use their courage, resourcefulness and luck, they grow in ways they never imagined.  Even as they reach their destination and establish their new warren, they still must defend their home.  Of all their enemies the greatest threat is from General Woundwort, a psychotic rabbit that runs his police-state warren with efficiency and a ruthlessness that would make Joe Stalin cringe.    Like El-ahairah, Hazel \\"must be cunning and full of tricks\\" or his people will be destroyed.    Of course they're not destroyed but the story is in the details not the ending.  And it is a truly wonderful story.

075640407X|5.0|Do NOT read The Name of the Wind! Because after you rip through it, madly, with almost demonic absorption, you will, at last, come to the final page. AND YOU WILL BE SAD. I tell you, this book has some alchemical magic that solidifies in your mind and will take up residence in your soul.<br /><br />Rothfuss is intimate with madness and magic and he uses both masterfully in crafting the portrait of Kvothe. But you get only one chunk of Kvothe's life, as he unveils it to his biographer, a chunk populated with jesters and troubadours and demons and jugglers, a paramour who disappears randomly, loathsome enemies, a haunting, tragic past, and always, always, the quest for greater magic, for the name of the wind.<br /><br />You know it's impossible for a first novel to be crafted from lead and authentically and powerfully made into gold like this. Or is it? Easily the best fantasy novel written in my lifetime, with two more installments of the Kvothe life story blessedly on their way. If I were a fantasy writer, I think reading Rothfuss would make me back away from the keyboard and take up lawn darts.
068983571X|4.0|\\"The Hound of the Baskervilles,\\" originally published in 1902, is an engrossing \\"who-dun-it\\" murder mystery, featuring observant detective Sherlock Holmes and his comparatively humble partner Dr. Watson at their best.  Labelled \\"a classic among classics\\" by mystery aficionados, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's masterfully written tale poses the problem--who killed Sir Charles Baskerville?--and offers well-placed clues en route to uncovering the resolution.  Set a few hours by train from London on the eerie Devonshire moor, where commoners affirm occasional sightings of a huge black hound-shaped beast, the story offers a suspenseful blend of science and the supernatural, with infallible Holmesian logic predictably winning out by story's end.<br /><br />My only reservation about the book is that it is perhaps a little too formulaic in composition.  Among the murder suspects are many:  the butler Barrymore and his wife, the neighboring Dr. Mortimer, the argumentative lawyer Frankland with his telescope, the energetic butterfly catcher Stapleton and his sister, the typist Laura Lyons in the adjacent village, the escaped convict Selden, a mysterious black-bearded man seen in London, and, of course, the elusive hound who murmurs and roars on the moor.  Watson's thorough narration and detailed letters to Holmes carefully lead us step-by-step through many of the possibilities; however, in my opinion, the overall plotline is more methodical and prematurely revealing than it needs to be.  Already by two-thirds of the way through the story, when Holmes, who is supposed to be in London, surprisingly appears on the moor as \\"the man on the tor,\\" we learn who the murderer must be, and the remaining one-third of the book is devoted to detective-style collection of evidence and explanation and recap of the mystery.  That's fine as a study for detectives-in-training, but might the book have had a chance of rising higher as a great work of literature if the author had put more effort into concealing Holmes' conclusion until later in the story, thereby creating a more sustained degree of suspense and intrigue?<br /><br />For the benefit of anyone who has not yet read the book, I do not want to give too much away, but as a hint in solving the murder mystery I will say that it helps to \\"follow the money\\" as you read.  After childless Sir Charles, who had made his fortune in overseas speculation, mysteriously dies, next-of-kin nephew Sir Henry returns to England to take control of the estate.  Assuming there is some financial motivation for the crime, as there usually is, who among the suspects, especially in light of their past circumstances and misfortune, could profit most from seeing both Charles and Henry dead?

1934451320|4.0|I have begun reading heavily on the mind and the power of the subconcious.  There seems to be alot more new out there that just \\"touches\\" on this phenomenom.  This book seems to put a logical spin on the illogical or the sometimes unexplainable, something I enjoy completely.  It is hard enough to begin to understand and use the psychology of the mind and the spirit and this book zeros right into the places you need to work on.      It is interesting to note that the original author wrote this book many years before this idea even became as popular as it is today. That seems to offer some credibility to me about whether this stuff is real or not.
B000F3T3CS|3.0|I'm sorry, BUT hiring young \\"hunks\\" like d'archangelo and Schrott as Dulcamara just doesn't work for me. They sing with too heroic a tone,and don't play with the language enough. If they are SO good-looking why doesn't Adina fall for them and why do they have to resort to selling a \\"magic potion\\"? The staging was just haphazard and I felt they had to make it up on the spot. No matter how much gray they put in his hair, Dulcamara comes off as just too young!   Nucci sings well, but looks too old, particularly with the ill-fitting soldiers costume that does not flatter him. He sings it very well though. Netrebko is beautiful and sings beautifully. Villazon is so lithe and agile and puts so much into the role that I hate to carp about the somewhat muscular \\"Una furtiva lagrima\\", and the encore just seemed like a planned trick for the DVD.  The chorus had nothing to do. They moved like a group with no individual characterization.
B000URDEB0|5.0|This album is phenomenal.  I know we all miss Tarja, but I do enjoy Annette quite a bit.  To me, her voice is more forceful (in a good way) than Tarja's, and perhaps has more power, while Tarja's was more controlled, trained, and added to the overall symphonic feel of the music.  She was unique, whereas there are plenty of singers who sound like Annette.  Both singers are brilliant.  Anyways, now on to the music.  Absolutely.  Amazing.  I can't get over it.  I haven't stopped listening to this album since I bought it.  Beautiful orchestra, powerful metal, sweeping choir, it's all there.  I love the more folk influenced songs.  I cannot say enough good things about this album.  Everyone needs to go buy this.  This is real music, and that is something most of the western world is lacking.  Basically, here is my advice to you.  Whatever you would have to hear to convince you to go buy this, pretend I just said all of that, because it's worth it.  You need this album.  Yes, that's right.  I only rated this five stars because there isn't an option for more.      Also of note, I like the added emphasis on the male vocals.

B000000H57|5.0|Three years after their masterpiece, Type O Negative releases their 1996 album, October Rust. Although October Rust wasn't as commercially succesfully as Bloody Kisses, it defintley is much better than Bloody Kisses. If Bloody Kisses is a masterpiece, then what would someone call this? Let's see the tracks shall we...    1. Bad Ground- It's a joke intro. Not much need to be said.    2.(Untitled)-A Thank you from the band.    3. Love You To Death-My absolute favorite song from this album, maybe my favorite Type O Negative song. The beginning might fool you due to the piano, but trust me, this song has a drab mood, but is a classin nonetheless. And Pete's vocals are amazing on this one.    4. Be My Druidess-A Very Driving beat to this song makes it perfect. Another highly reccomended song, a shame they almost never play it now.    5. Green Man-Starts out really earthy and with low vocals but then launches into a typical Type O Negative beat. Once again, Peter does an incredible job on vocals.    6. Red Water(Christmas Mourning)-The intro is incredible. Very gloomy song, though even for Type O Negative.    7. My Girlfriend's Girlfriend-The intro makes me laugh with the drums and organ, everyone likes this song a lot, but it doesn't appeal to me much. But still a great song    8. Die With Me-The acoustic sounding guitars are awesome for this song. Another favorite.    9. Burnt Flowers Fallen-Another one that doesn't appeal too much, but this song doesn't sound like it was from 1996, it sounds too ahed of its time, although it doesn't appeal to me that much, it is still an awesome song.    10. In Praise Of Bacchus-I absolutely love this song. The guitars in the beginning are outstanding and so is Pete's Voice. Anyone who buys this album, has to hear this song.    11. Cinnamon Girl-Ah...the Neil Young cover. And it is a great cover. Much more driving than the original, but it still makes you want to sing to it. Type O Negative really makes it their own.    12. The Glorious Liberation Of The People's Technocratic Republic Of Vinnland By The Combined Forces-Eh...nothing much to mention here...just an interlude.    13. Wolf Moon-A Very dark song. As well as the beginning is very dark.    14. Haunted- Amazing way to end an amazing album. Although it's 10 minutes, try to get past that and listen to the whole song.    15. (Untitled)-Goodbye From  The Band.

B000URDEB0|3.0|If \\"the mainstream\\" can be defined as the majority, then Nightwish is heading in the right direction in expanding their popularity with the American audience. This album is less experimental and more poppy than any of the previous Nightwish albums.<br /><br />Annette can sing, yes. But compared to Tarja's mature operatic vocals, Annette sometimes sounds like a little girl. Maybe this is what Nightwish wanted, I mean look at some of their album covers that have children on them. Anyway, I do miss Tarja already.<br /><br />Die hard fans of real European gothic metal will be better suited with Epica's latest release, The Divine Conspiracy. I believe Epica's latest CD is the best gothic metal album of 2007. This has been a sad year for gothic metal as Sirenia also became poppy and mainstream and Tristania lost Vibeke. At least Storm was a solid release by Theatre of Tragedy.<br /><br />Okay, enough rambling about other bands. This new Nightwish album has some great, catchy songs. But overall it is kind of mainstream and it feels really long, almost to the point that it gets boring. I'm happy that this CD will bring the band more US fans and everything, but in my opinion this does not meet the consistent caliber of the three albums before it.
B00004WF68|2.0|As Amazon has done before, it fails to disclose that this CD is recorded on MONOphonic sound.

B000BMSTMS|4.0|I personally enjoy this cd so very much.  Sure is it not your typical Korn you know and love as you were  growing up with the band's music depending on your age. I liked almost the whole cd I didn't care for track 10 Getting off, and Track 12 For No One. The rest of the cd to me was quite good and enjoy the different style of music by them for both the lryics and the music.  My favorite song has to be love song.  The lyrics mean something to me as i listen to the song.  I also enjoy coming undone, throw me away, and tearjerker.  If you listen to it with an open mind and the lyrics then you might find you actually enjoy their new style. This won't please everyone who is a fan of Korn but it does have some deep lryics within the songs on this new cd of their's.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I have been a qotsa fan for many years, This album went beyond my expectations.   \\"Suture up your future\\" is one of my favorite songs ever. Brilliant. The album rocks, \\"3's and 7's\\", \\"run pig run\\", \\"battery acid\\", all good.   I could have done without \\"Gonna make it wit chu\\", but its not a bad track, just nothing new.   The disc isnt what you might expect as a follow up to \\"Lullabies\\", it isnt comercial at all, no hit singles just solid rock.

B000001F5F|1.0|This \\"album\\" is a collection of singles. U2 needs to take a whole concert and put it on CD. And only eight songs!
B000URDEB0|4.0|Say what you will about Annette, In my opinion it would take a really horrible singer to make this music bad and Annette is not a horrible singer.  I agree with most people in that her voice is not nearly as powerful and bombastic as Tarja, and I definetly miss that, but Tuomas is such a good songwriter that even Annette can't slow him down.  Im not saying I don't like her singing, but I am saying I prefer Tarja.  But, Tarja is out and Annette is in so we might as well accept it.<br />  Moving on to the album, one thing I give Tuomas props for is his ability to compose incredible orchestrations. In fact, if this album came out without any vocals whatsoever I would still be totally into it.  The orchestra is by far my favorite part of this album.  It adds the dramatic, heavy, and powerful feel that Annette's vocals lack.<br /><br /> The album starts off with the epic 13 minute Poet and the Pendulum which I think is the better song on the album.  It has a great score and is a powerful as well as beautiful song, great contrast between the heavy parts of the song and the softer parts which blend together really well.  Annette does deliver a decent performance, at first I didn't like how the heavyness and bombast all had to stop for Annette when she comes in to sing a verse, but I guess it grew on me, it doesn't bother me now.  There are other songs on the ablum I really like, but mostly for the same reasons, The orhcestra and overall instrumentation.<br /><br />The songs I feel like gripeing about however are Bye Bye Beautiful, Amarath, and For The Heart I Once Had. Bye Bye beautiful is a good song, but its just the fact that the song was written for Tarja gives me a weird vibe whenever I listen to the lyrics.  Maybe its just me, I dunno.  Also I don't feel like the chorus flows that well with the rest of the song, but who knows maybe that will grow on me too.  Amarath bugs me in that the chorus is annoyingly poppy.  Again, its just my personal opinion.  Annette thou is definetly a poppy type singer thou, and she really brings that element to the song.  Im not sure if this is true, but I heard that Tuomas didn't even want Amarath on the album but the record company made him put it on and make a single out of it.  which makes sense since it is such a pop sounding song and it will probably bring them some extra $$$ due to its more mainstream feel.  The verse of \\"The Heart I Once Had\\" also bugs me for its annoying poppyness.<br /><br />Overall an impressive album.  I only gave it four starts because I am going by Nightwish standards, which are quite high.  And for all the die hard Tarja followers, I say really try to give Annette a chance because Nightwish is still making really good music.  Yeah, she is a pop singer, but Nightwish is still a metal band, just a metal band with a pop singer.<br />So thats basically it.  Im not even going to go into it about Tuomas and his newfound love for writing celtic songs, other people seem to like it so I am just going to shut up.a poppy type singer thou, and she really brings that element to the song.  Im not sure if this is true, but I heard that Tuomas didn't even want Amarath on the album but the record company made him put it on and make a single out of it.  which makes sense since it is such a pop sounding song and it will probably bring them some extra $$$ due to its more mainstream feel.  The verse of \\"The Heart I Once Had\\" also bugs me for its annoying poppyness.         Overall an impressive album.  I only gave it four starts because I am going by Nightwish standards, which are quite high.  And for all the die hard Tarja followers, I say really try to give Annette a chance because Nightwish is still making really good music.  Yeah, she is a pop singer, but Nightwish is still a metal band, just a metal band with a pop singer.   So thats basically it.  Im not even going to go into it about Tuomas and his newfound love for writing celtic songs, other people seem to like it so I am just going to shut up.
0765316889|2.0|The first book in this trilogy, Mistborn, was exciting, original, and worth the time. What's not to like about a group of rogues overthrowing an oppressive government, after all? This book, which slogs through the aftermath of those events, doesn't even come close to living up to the quality of its predecessor. (Some minor spoilers follow.)<br /><br />Because the animating spirit of the first book, Kelsier, is no longer available, we are left with Vin and Elend as our main protagonists. Vin is powerful, Elend is principled, and they're supposedly in love (though, really, their romance feels like it was scripted by George Lucas at his most tedious--reading their conversations was like watching Young Darth and the Queen all over again. Boring, boring, boring). I was rather hoping their relationship would fail, because that seemed the only way that something emotionally interesting might happen to someone--no such luck. If you're still rooting for their tepid young love by the end of the book, you're a more tolerant soul than I.<br /><br />The plot is equally inspiring. The heroes have defeated the Lord Ruler only to find themselves confronted with a new set of problems, none of which are very interesting unless 1) you like siege warfare or 2) you enjoy fantasy villains that are super powerful, unfathomable, and apparently inhuman. The human bad guys are just silly and irritating, and it's impossible to take them seriously, especially with a character like Vin around. When the good guys can kill anyone they want, anytime, with only a minimum of trouble, how can we be expected to worry about the various scheming contenders for Elend's throne? We can't, of course. The result of all this is a serious lack of suspense.<br /><br />If you just *have* to know what happens next, by all means check this book out of the library and give it a look. If Kelsier was the reason you enjoyed Mistborn, however, you might be better advised to spend your time with a more worthwhile novel, as this one is unlikely to satisfy.to satisfy.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|When Bruce put out The Seger Sessions I was disappointed.  I said, \\"Alright.  He's had his little experiments, and they were good.  But, PLEASE let him get back with E Street for the next one!\\"  Not only is the rock back but sometimes the feel of the music is so epic that the volume seems to turn itself up.  I would list the best tracks, but I don't think I could, there are about 8 songs on the album I would classify as \\"excellent\\".  To hear those thousand guitars and pounding drums once again is nothing but fun.  This is the Bruce album we've all been craving since The Rising.
0385522401|5.0|Exquisite in its simplicity, this book presents an unforgettable, heart-breaking love story. Devastatingly simple, this simplicity actually intensifies the effect of the plot.  Ian McEwen develops characters we really care about, so when one decision changes the lovers' lives forever, we feel regret and overwhelming grief. Through the character of Florence, we learn of the value of being true to oneself. Through the character of Edward, Mr. McEwen impresses upon us how clear, mournful, and disturbing hindsight can be.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I have heard enough of there new songs to say yes this a great CD. And no this is not more mainstream. If they wanted to be more mainstream then make four very long songs is not the way to go. Most people can not stand to listen to a 14 minute long song that is The Poet and the Pendulum. The prolbem that people have with this CD the real prolbem no matter if they come out and say it or not is......It does not have Tarja. Well to bad Nightwish was never about Tarja it was about the music. ONCE was the more mianstream ablum. This on the other hand is far from being mainstream.

0385340559|2.0|I picked up Bad Luck and Trouble because it sounded like an interesting book.  I must say, though, that it was not my cup of tea.  I, on the whole, enjoy crime novels and spy thrillers in the vein of Vince Flynn and David Baldacci.  Lee Child most likely fits here nicely.<br /><br />The story is about Jack Reacher, a former military policeman.  He receives a call for help from one of his former teammates.  It seems that several members of the unit have disappeared and Reacher needs to find out why.  Interesting premise, but it quickly devolves into a revenge novel with a little bit of \\"let's stop the terrorist\\" thrown in to make the story timely.<br /><br />I have no problem with the writing of the book.  Mr. Child is a very talented writer.  I just did not enjoy the story.  Revenge for the sake of revenge is not my idea of a good time.
0316067598|5.0|To become a U.S. Navy SEAL is one huge undertaking for those attempting such a feat.  The training they get is the best in the world.  When sent on a mission that is in the best interests of our country, it is absolutely absurd for them to make decisions based upon how the media in our country will respond to their efforts and actions.  Such decisions cost the lives of three brave U.S. Navy SEALs and this story tells how this happened.  The war on terrorism is very real and we must not allow the drive by media to control the actions of those who place their lives on the line in protecting us here in the U.S.  This enemy is brutal and think nothing of killing us in their quest to remove the infidels of the world which are all non-Muslims.  We live in a great country that shields us from the horrors of these terrorists by making them sound like freedom fighting heros.  This book clearly states the case for a more concerted and concentrated effort that is needed to make U.S. citizens aware of the dangers we face.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|A phenomenal triumph of form and scale from the master of the nonsensical, David Lynch. I think that Lynch has truly exploded film itself with this 3-hour opus, and he has truly abandoned the notion of \\"marketability.\\" Laura Dern gives perhaps the greatest performance of her career as multiple characters, the first of which is an actress hired under less than clear circumstances to appear in a commercial melodrama called On High and Blue Tomorrows. What is incredible about Inland Empire is how engaging it remains despite its incoherent plot and structure. Lynch is hitting you with a nightmarish intensity that can be felt, and only understood within the internal logic of the subconscious. This movie is scary, funny, ironic, complex, and strangely moving all at the same time. A true masterpiece, one the most impressive films of the decade.
0143038419|4.0|As a woman who went through a difficult and emotionally draining divorce myself, I can relate to the author's desire to make a change in her life, yet at the same time not knowing exactly what she is searching for.

This book is a great read for women, especially if you are on your own spiritual journey after a major change in your life.

B000UG3VG4|5.0|Since just about every human on the planet seems to own Legend, it's hardly necessary to describe the King of Reggae's music. Marley's style developed early under the tutelage of Lee Perry, who influenced Marley's phrasing. His voice graced early Ska, Rock Steady and Reggae recordings, but many believe that the time he spent backed by fellow Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston was the most artistically satisfying of his career. The varied personal styles that the trio brought to recording sessions and live performances represented the culmination of Jamaican trio-style singing. Marley's soulful vocal leads were supported by Tosh's deep, almost angry diatribes, while Livingston (who later changed his name to Bunny Wailer) provided balancing high harmonies. The group added an R&B influence to slowed-down Ska, using vocal interplay similar to that of U.S. Doo-Wop and Soul acts. When backed by the Upsetters, one of Jamaica's hottest studio bands, the Wailers combined a tight vocal unit with exceptional rhythmic underpinning. That combination was responsible for Marley's first international smash Catch a Fire, as well as the brilliant, Lee Perry-produced African Herbsman. Later, Marley utilized female singers in the I-Threes when Peter and Bunny left to pursue solo careers. It took Eric Clapton's chart-topping success with \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" to introduce Marley's music to a wide audience in the U.S., but today his sound is a bona fide international phenomenon. Biting lyrics coated in sugary-sweet melodies made Marley a genuine political force who delivered his messages in upbeat, rhythmic vehicles. His prophetic wails still ring true; his expansive music remains powerful and virtuosic. We're left wondering why we had to lose the Caribbean negus at such a young age.
B000M341QE|3.0|When I first saw this movie, The Departed, I thought that it was one of the great movies I've ever seen. It was directed very well with great actors and great story.     Then I saw a movie called Infernal Affairs. I thought the Chinese copied The Departed, but it was the other way.     What a shame!
0142002038|5.0|Although Dr. No is the sixth book in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, it is also a first in a few key ways.  From a cinematic standpoint, Dr. No was the first James Bond book adapted into a movie (with only a crude TV version of Casino Royale preceding it).  In addition, it is the first of the Bond novels to feature the villain as a title character (to be followed by Goldfinger and The Man With the Golden Gun).  Most significantly, perhaps, is that Dr. No is the first novel to feature the truly megalomanical villain; only Hugo Drax, in Moonraker, comes close, and even his ambitions fit more in the category of violent than power-hungry.    As Dr. No begins, John Strangways, Britain's man in Jamaica is killed along with his female assistant.  With no bodies found, it is assumed the two ran away on a lover's tryst.  In England, Bond is recovering from a near-death experience (which occurred at the conclusion of From Russia With Love).  M, uncertain if Bond is up to full strength, assigns him to look into the disappearance, figuring that it will be more of a vacation than a real job.  Bond is insulted, but takes on the assignment.    Bond, who last met Strangways in Live and Let Die, suspects the worst, a feeling that intensifies when people start following him and attempting to kill him.  The only suspect is the mysterious Dr. No, a Chinese-German who owns most of Crab Key, an island around thirty miles from Jamaica.  Before Strangways died, he had been investigating claims that Dr. No was disrupting a bird sanctuary.  With the assistance of the local Quarrel (also last seen in Live and Let Die), Bond decides to sneak onto Crab Key for a closer look.    Once they get to the island, they encounter the beautiful shell-seeker Honey Rider (what would a Bond book be without a beautiful woman, usually psychologically scarred and in need of meeting the right man?); Honey will accidentally alert the guards of their presence, eventually leading to capture by Dr. No.  Julius Nois the epitome of a Bond villain:  clever, resourceful, merciless and sadistic.  Dr. No wants to have his own little kingdom and he isn't about to let Bond get in his way.  Of course, he will carefully describe all his plans before leaving Bond in a deadly trap.    Yes, it is a little over-the-top and has its share of traits that would eventually become cliches of the genre, but for what it intends to be - a straightforward and simple adventure story - it succeeds well.  Following on the heels of what is perhaps the best Bond book - From Russia With Love - Dr. No is Fleming continuing to be at the top of his writing game.
0143038419|1.0|This lady is simply a self absorbed & ungrateful person.     Also, this book is not practical at all- for most people can't afford to go to a spiritual journey as hers or spend months on their bathroom floor-things are very different when you have to get up and going in the morning- and an average person who spends a couple of months crying on their bathroom floor till the wee hours will have a lot more to be depressed about then their initial problems- for other things around them will fall apart. I guess this is a good book if you can afford to sc--w everything and disapear. But if you can't afford this- I don't think, as I already mentioned, that ur journey (being the authors journey) is a \\"practical\\" one to the point where her journey can help many others. But then again I am just speaking from my perspective as a young, single woman.      As for the writing- its beautiful but the message gets lost amongst the authors self centered perspective.
0465092756|3.0|String theorists have so far been unable to use their results to predict new experimental findings.

0385486804|5.0|I rarely read a book in one day but I just did with Jon Krakauer's book INTO THE WILD, the true life story of Christopher McCandless. I had the immense pleasure of seeing the film last weekend. The next logical step for me was to read the book the film was based on.<br /><br />By now most people know the story about Christopher McCandless (aka Alexander Supertramp). Christopher was a young man in his early 20s who had just graduated from Emory University. He grew up in a well to do family. You would think that anyone with Christopher's background would be content and happy but not Christopher. He deplored wealth and materialism. After college, Christopher severed all contact with his family including his sister Carine who he was most close to, and set off on his own spiritual journey across the country. He donated the remaining money in his trust fund account to charity and destroyed every vestigage of his identity as Christopher McCandless. As his cocky alter ego Alexander Supertramp, Christopher traveled around the US and eventually to Alaska. Along the way he met a slew of colorful characters. Unfortunately his cockiness and lack of experience in the harsh wilderness of Alaska proved to be his downfall.<br /><br />Journalist Jon Krakauer explores Christopher's travels through various writings and conversations with his family as well as friends. I enjoyed reading Jon's investigation into Christopher's life and adventures. He does a great job at dissecting Christopher as a human being as well as the decisions he had made through out his short life. While I do think Christopher was foolish and arrogant to not come prepared to live in Alaska, the quick dismissal of him as a loon is an insult to McCandless' family. The man is dead and his family will never see him again. I think that alone is cruel enough.<br /><br />My only beef with this book is the two chapters that focuses on the author's desires to climb Devil's Thumb. I know Jon was only trying to place himself in Christopher's shoes but two chapters? I think that should have been whittled down to a chapter, or better yet a page or two. Other than that, I loved INTO THE WILD. It is not very often do I come across a book that will make me want to step away from the computer or tv and just sit back and spend the entire day reading.but two chapters?

B000RG1FMO|4.0|While hip hop may not be my favorite style of music. Kanye has always seemed to be exceptional to my ears.  His appreciation of pop music and  fearless use of various genre's for his dubs alone makes him memorable.  Minimalist production but killer beats rule and while I prefer 'Late Registration' I hesitate to say which is better.  This guy is still evolving and Im diggin the ride. Solid four star effort.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|First of all, the Firefly series, which this movie is based on, should have never ever been cancelled during it's first season. It is a series that should have enjoyed a long well-praised life on TV. The chemistry between the characters were superb and the main characters were wonderfully interesting and complex, especially the captain. I just had 100% faith that the series would have been renewed or picked up by another network. There was no doubt in my mind...that just how good the series is.    Next, the movie was excellent, action-packed, and greatly lives up to the spirit of the TV series. You care about the characters and the action draws you in. I hate that the movie had come so soon. Although I loved the movie, I feel like I was robbed of all of the adventures and character development that should have occured through the life of a TV series. It's like watching Michael Jordan developing into a great basketball player during his Rookie season only to be immediately fast forwarded towards the end of his career where he is playing the last championship game of his career. You could only imagine how exiciting it would have been to watch him actually develop into such a great athlete. This is what it feels like to watch the truncated Firefly series and then to be immediately fast forwarded to the end of the story when watching this great movie.
0061148512|5.0|I picked up The Bell Jar by chance, I was looking through Barnes and Noble, I saw it, and asked my mother what she thought of it.  \\"Oh it's about someone like you and your sisters, crazy.\\"  Instantly I bought it (I picked the one with the fabulous cover of course!)  I read it in 1.5 hours.  It is a delicious read. You can really taste the words and the madness inside of the character. It amplifies madness and beauty. It sits on a place of honor, on my shelf of favorites.  Buy it and read it. The story will sweep you off your feet and drag you into the realms of madness.  Taste and see.
B000O178BY|5.0|'Year Zero' is the best album of Reznor's career for more than one reason. The music itself is far more interesting and mature-sounding than anything he's ever written. Despite what some have said, this lengthy album holds my interest from beginning to end. Every song is distinct and will develop its own personality the more you listen to them. The music is heavily constructed with the characteristic NIN electronics and techno grooves. But in addition to this, hard-hitting rock riffs, guitar and percussion sections permeate the dance beats. Horns and pianos also show up to punch a hole in the intensity.     The other characteristic of 'Year Zero' that sets it apart from the rest of Reznor's work is the message that the music conveys. All of Nine Inch Nails' other albums were heavily focused on personal conflicts and emotions. Dwelling inside Reznor's tormented mind for any length of time can really take its toll, which made earlier NIN albums somewhat oppressive and difficult to listen to.    The lyrics and message of 'Year Zero' are not only more mature than Reznor's earlier works, but are also much more relevant in today's troubled times, discussing worldly trends in politics and society. Each song tells part of a story of a near-future that \\"might be\\" if current trends are allowed to continue. And in the midst of all of these catastrophic political goings-on, signs of the apocalypse start showing up, including \\"The Presence,\\" which can be seen on the front of the album artwork. The Presence serves as a warning to mankind; the appearance of the Presence in this fictional world reveals that otherworldly beings are watching mankind from on-high, and are prepared to intervene in our self-destructive cycle. They offer an ultimatum: \\"you'll change your ways and make amends or we'll wipe this place clean.\\" No matter what your political affiliation is, this message is one that you can appreciate and respect. It's scary, dark, and powerful.    'Year Zero' is hands-down the most impressive work that Reznor has ever delivered. Musically and lyrically, this is Nine Inch Nails at its very best. The thoughtfulness of the album's lyrics and message are as compelling as the music itself, and are nothing short of epic. 'Year Zero' reveals a humanity that is fractured, ailing, and self-destructive. With 'Year Zero,' Trent Reznor has finally created an epic masterpiece that is as relevant and powerful as it is enjoyable to listen to.
B000EGEVZK|5.0|The Ramones were great because they gave you music worth listening to. This wasn't an easy task in the seventies when progressive rock & disco dominated things.   The Ramones used their mega stripped-down garage band line-up and their rudimentary playing ability to propel their unique take on traditional rock'n'roll.   In the generation I grew up in...The RAMONES were OUR Beatles!!!  It's great to have these live recordings of the guys available. Thanks Rhino.

B000JKA0B0|4.0|This has been a highly anticipated edition to my collection, and I got it for a deal here on amazon with free super saver shipping.  Worth every penny.  190 page book, 2 live cd's, live dvd, and documentary DVD.  The show has evolved some since Live Aus Berlin (which I consider a much better live show), but still has the bite that you expect from the Metal/Techo/Industrial monster outfit.  This still brings me flashbacks of when they were touring the US in 2001-2 when I saw them in Kansas City.  The have an acoustic song tossed into the set which is just mindblowing to see done, but a great pace changer/transition in the set.  Things that kept this from 5 stars was basically the camera work, and the qaulity of the film.  At times, the smoke obscured the stage, and they focused a lot on the frontman, missing some of the side action.  Not quite as active of a show either, they are more relaxed with their maturity.  Overall, a must have for Rammstein fans.
0743486285|3.0|I love it when rockstars use their childhood memories as a basis to do drugs. Like they are the only people who have had a terrible childhood and must act out by doing drugs and destroying everything and everyone around them. Get over it already. Really. I found the book to be tedious at times, sometimes entertaining, but overall, I really just wanted to tell him to \\"F%$K off\\" and get over himself. \\"mommy didn't love me\\", \\"daddy desserted me\\", blah blah blah. Sucks for him, but the reality of life is that sometimes you don't win the parent lottery. I finished the book wondering whether his legacy for his children would leave them feeling as empty and abandoned as he himself had....the touring, the cheating on mommy on the road, the countless hours in the studio...absent father? I think so. Book is worth reading, but don't get sucked into his pity party...it's sort of pathetic.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|The first album I ever bought, which was in the late 60's, was the original Bee Gee's Greatest Hits. Since then, many musical legends have gone by the wayside, but these guys still can perform, and their music still speaks volumes. From their early years through the disco era and beyond, this DVD captures the wide range of unique BeeGee sounds. Unlike many concerts today, this concert was all about the music, which does not need overdone theatrics, skin, pyrotechnics or lighting to provide a great evening of entertainment. While I more than once verbally spurned the BeeGees when they transitioned away from their original style to disco, and their patent falsetto singing style, I found that watching them perform their newer music in this concert was still highly enjoyable - perhaps not what I would choose to listen to, but as part of the entire concert, it really works. Our entire family, ranging in age from 5 to 50+, has repeatedly enjoyed this DVD, and we all endorse and recommend it!

0962477060|5.0|This book is all about the CAGED system. At first there was some skepticism about the whole theory of the Caged System, you know--I figured it would be better to learn the fretboard in a more natural way--by notes and by memory, not by patterns. However, as I went deeper into my studies and deeper into this book, it made me realize how ESSENTIAL patterns are to learning guitar. Everything in life comes in patterns, and the CAGED system is one of the most important and simple patterns to memories. I find this book astonishing and intelligent--a great read!<br /><br />-Dr. Kenneth

0060763280|5.0|T. Harv Eker has written an excellent book that makes you look into yourself to help identify what is holding you back from achieving your financial goals.  In reading this book, you challenge your assumptions about yourself and he makes you think if you are truly willing to do what it takes to be rich.  Extremely worthwhile and I will pursue additional materials and opportunities to hear Mr. Eker speak.
B000O77SRC|5.0|I guess it shows you how being endlessly replayed on TV and endlessly copied causes a film to be taken for granted.  This one really set the stage for the modern action film.  Particularly the sub-genre of one guy against a gang of baddies.  Starts fast and never lets up.  Justifiably made a superstar out of Bruce Willis.  Alan Rickman is equally good as the head bad guy.  If you like action films and somehow you missed this, you have a treat coming.  If you kind of remember it, but haven't seen it in years, I think you will find it holds up well, with its special effects comparing favorably with the cgi wizardry of more recent films.
0385341067|4.0|If you enjoy reading,I think you will really like this book. It celebrates the affect a book can have on people's lives.The little girl who lived the life of Pip from Dickens' tale is a character never to be forgotten. The descriptions of the poverty of the village,the cruelty of the warfare going on there and the lives of the villagers are most skillfully drawn.The schoolmaster who introduced the children to Great Expectations and the mother of the little girl who stands up for what she believes is right are memorable. This is a most readable book and a story you won't forget.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Definitely 5 stars. A real treat.    As one reviewer said, you can feel the oppression. These foreign movies have a quality and subtlety that many American movies just don't have.     The movie is understated but always very interesting. They accomplish the sense of oppression through the personal lives of the characters, not through a dramatic show of military power or gratuitous violence, and the result is a more palpable and personal sense of oppression.     I will not go on and on about this fantastic movie because there are numerous well-written reviews. However, this is fantastic movie-making and one that really reaches you on an intellectual level and will stick with you.    A note about subtitles. Do not be put off by subtitles. Many of these foreign films have less, but more intelligent, dialogue than the typical American movie. The subtitles are not long or difficult to follow. However, the positive is that they do require you to pay close attention to the movie, and in this case, that is a very positive development.    Highly Recommended.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|movie was a good action, fast paced movie that is appropriate for all age groups
B000MCH5P4|4.0|This is a very good movie in some ways and not so good in others. The cinematography and acting are top notch. the various sub-plots are interesting and grounded in reality, i.e. there are no overly dramatic events that make the movie unbelievable. The scenery and acting really make you feel the emotion in the characters. You can't help but feel the deep pain of the deaf girl who is looking for the wrongs things in the wrong places. You feel like you are watching 3 or 4 movies at once because the converging plots are so different from one another, and yet, each sub plot is emotionally packed and very well acted in its own right.      On the other hand, I believe the filmmaker bit off a little more than he could chew. Some of the extended shots are designed to emphasize the setting of the particular plot...and it works very well, however, it also tends to slow the movie down more than necessary. And since this type of movie tends to be a little slow and hard to follow to begin with, any storyline or technique that slows it even further is detrimental. Maybe more of that time should have been spent on the great acting.    The story does come together in the end and each of the sub-plots are closed out in an acceptable manner, however, it all seemed a little anti-climactic. Tough to put my finger on it, but the end did not live up to the build-up. That may, in fact, be a very realistic ending to the plot, but it did not provide any dramatic punch.    To close, this is a good movie that is very well acted and filmed. The downside would be the overly ambitious approach, the slow pace at times, and the somewhat uninteresting ending.
0099439972|4.0|This novel takes place just before the beginning of Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.  It gives some background information about certain things from TPM, such as the Trade Federation's blockade of Naboo. It also introduces some interesting characters whom I grew attached too.  Unfortunately, knowing what happens in TPM does diffuse some suspense, but this novel does match the movie in tone and in pacing, so if you like The Phantom Menace, you should like this book.
B000H305U0|4.0|Justin Timberlake returned years after releasing his highly successful debut CD [[ASIN:B00006JO4Q Justified]] to release this one.  It's a bit different from the first one.  The insppirations from the first aren't as present, and Pharell Williams is no longer the top producer.  But this CD is a wonderful one to have.    The most original song is the title track, a fun, funky, beautiful song.  Next are all songs that could be singles, SexyBack, Sexy Ladies, My Love, Love Stoned, and What Goes Around...Comes Around.    This is followed with two hip hop inspired tracks Chop Me Up and Damn Girl, then the CD mellows into the stylings of Summer Love, Until the End of Time, Losing My Way, and (Another Song) All Over Again.    Highly recommended.

B00003CXC6|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's 1950 masterpiece was the western culture's introduction to the greatness that is Akira Kurosawa.  This is an incredible film.  One of the best of all time, one that is not dated, features great acting, amazing direction, and one doozy of a story.  This just may be my favorite Kurosawa film.  It's an intellectual and entertainment treat.    Criterion always releases overstuffed DVDs and this one does not disappoint.  Featuring a commentary and a number of awesome featurettes, you'd be foolish to pass this one up.    Must Have.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Zodiac begins on July 4, 1969.  The Zodiac Killer shoots two young lovers, slaying a woman but not the man. A month later, a letter written by the Zodiac Killer arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle.  Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) covers the story while the cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) struggles to decrypt the Zodiac's ciphers.<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer's murders take place throughout California, a fact that muddles the case further as the various police departments and sheriff offices struggle to work together. The investigators include San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards), Vallejo detective Jack Mualanax (Elias Koteas), and Napa detective (Donal Logue).<br /><br />The Zodiac Killer's murders are particularly noteworthy because there was a constant discourse between the serial killer and the media.  The Zodiac Killer's threats included puzzles (his ciphers), creepy details about his murders (bloody bits of cloth), and finally threats against school buses full of children. In short, the Killer manipulates the media as deftly as Paris Hilton on a reality show.<br /><br />The movie skips ahead as the years go by and the case grows cold. Evidence gathering techniques are sorely outdated or questionably biased, detectives on the case move on, and everyone but Graysmith is determined to find the real killer.<br /><br />What's intriguing about Zodiac is how it manages to combine the fact-finding wonkiness of CSI with the thrilling suspense of Silence of the Lambs.  Fincher manages to balloon the Zodiac Killer into a pernicious boogeyman who is every potential suspect and behind every murder.  And that may literally be true: one theory is that the Zodiac Killer took credit for murders he didn't commit.  A roadside encounter between a woman with her infant child and a mysterious stranger is one of the scariest moments on film (for new parents like me, anyway).<br /><br />And it's all true.  In an era where Ed Gein's murders have been spun into the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the relevance and reality of Zodiac makes the movie even more frightening. Although the murders were never pinned on a particular person, Graysmith (also the author of the novel) makes a convincing case for Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />Was it really Arthur?  We'll never know.  Zodiac isn't about wrapping up the film with an easy villain.  It's about the price of living in a media-saturated culture where, for three years, the scariest reality show took place not on our televisions but in handful of towns in northern California.been spun into the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the relevance and reality of Zodiac makes the movie even more frightening.

B000078DOI|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers hit their stride with this release.  With John and Chad replaces their two former members, the Chili Peppers crafted the sound they are better known for today.  This is the first of their great albums.    The opening of Good Time Boys to the closing of Johnny, Kick A Hole in the Sky, this CD is magical.  Quite magical.    My favorites include Magic Johnson, Knock Me Down, Taste the Pain, Sexy Mexican Maid, Stone Cold Bush, and Pretty Little Ditty.    Highly recommended.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|In \\"Microtrends,\\" a new book by pollster Mark Penn, 1 percent of Californians between the ages of 16 and 22 expected to be military snipers in 10 years. Why? \\"Aspiring snipers are evidence of a patriotic generation, who see sniping--a profession requiring reserve and cool in a war without front lines--as the new \\"Top Gun\\" military profession.\\" Mix this particular factoid with the \\"other gunman\\" conspiracy theory and you have Shooter.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays Bob Lee Swagger, a military sniper abandoned during a field op.  His best friend dies in the ensuing fracas, but Swagger survives to become one of those militia-type recluses who lives alone with his dog in the mountains, spouting conspiracy theory.  He's just the kind of antihero America needs, and it's not long before Colonel Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover) asks for his help in serving the country once more.  It seems an assassination attempt is planned against the President, and only Swagger can plot out the sniper's moves before he actually makes them.  Playing on Swagger's patriotic sympathies, Johnson lures him out into the open and...<br /><br />Spoiler alert!  But seriously, you saw this coming, right?<br /><br />Surprise, surprise, in retracing the steps of a would-be assassin, Swagger is framed AS the assassin! An all-out manhunt ensues, with Swagger enlisting allies like the girlfriend of his dead buddy (tasty Kate Mara as Sarah Fenn) and an agent in the wrong place at the wrong time (Michael Pena as Nick Memphis).  Seems the good Colonel is actually a subversive government agent working for a Dick Cheney-esque senator, Charles F. Meachum (Ned Beatty).<br /><br />Thus ensues a cat-and-also-cat game between Swagger and everyone else as they struggle to track down a ghost who strikes like a thunderbolt out of the blue.  The twists and turns, the blatant pandering to conspiracy theory, and the demonizing of a Republican-run government are all very entertaining or insulting, depending on your views.  And Shooter delivers in spades, with plenty of head shots that make this movie the modern descendant of Rambo.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Shooter is also highly predictable.  Swagger's inevitable betrayal is obvious from the start.  And the fact that the government agents might not be good guys is clearly telegraphed by Elias Koteas, who dresses like a bad guy in his black suit and tie, and even adjusts it once, goodfella style. I mean, the guy's  name is Jack Payne for crying out loud!  Why not just call him Major Blood and be done with it?<br /><br />Still, Shooter is very entertaining.  There's enough skin, violence, humor and conspiracy theory to keep an audience entertained. The ending may be complete wish fulfillment, but it's extremely satisfying. Those Californians will have plenty of reasons to want to be snipers by the end of this film.with plenty of head shots that make this movie the modern descendant of Rambo.

B000TGJ80S|4.0|With the many number of retellings of Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula, this may not impress you as much as [[ASIN:B000GPIPSS Dracula (75th Anniversary Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)]], but it is a very beautiful picture.  The sets, the clothes, the costumes are all amazing.    It's a flawed movie, but is visually at the peak of success.  One of the best visuals I've ever seen captured on film.    I do recommend this, the DVD features are quite enough to keep you entertained.  There's plenty of deleted scenes and featurettes on this two disc edition.  Also, a video introduction and commentary by Francis Ford Coppola are sure to delight.    Highly, highly recommended.
B000RJO578|3.0|I loved Shaun of the Dead, so I expected that same magical combination of action, humor, and homage in Hot Fuzz.  And that's mostly what I got.  Mostly.<br /><br />Simon Pegg is Nicholas Angel, a super cop that is driving the London bobbies mad because he's so good at his job.  To keep him out of their hair, the London office sends Angel to a little town known as Sandford.  There, he is teamed up with Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), a bit of a slob who wants to be a good cop but learned most of it from watching movies like Point Break and Bad Boys.<br /><br />Life's pretty boring in Sandford, but there's more than meets the eye. Like every good film made by British blokes, the city folk are secretly suspicious of the common people. And that of course means there's a cult lurking about that must be stopped. It all has something of a Wicker Man feel to it.<br /><br />The first half of the film is something of a murder mystery, as black clad assailants reminiscent of Scream brutally off witnesses. Once Angel and Butterman discover the truth, the film degenerates into an all out gun-fest, including acrobatics, car chases, foot chases, and wicked one liners.<br /><br />The problem with Hot Fuzz is that it's shot exactly like Shaun of the Dead, complete with the cut scenes, character dialogue, and gore.  Frost is playing almost the exact same character from the first film, except that instead of being a useless drug dealer he's a useless cop instead.<br /><br />And then there's the gore. I've seen a lot of buddy cop shows and none of them are as disgustingly gory as the murders in Hot Fuzz. It's as if the movie was filmed by horror buffs who like action films, but they didn't know precisely how to create an action film so they went with what they know best - whenever a scene calls for gore, the movie goes way over the top. This includes one victim's head exploding on screen as a church spire drives down into his ribcage (we get to watch him stumble about a few seconds, sans head) and another church spire, this time in miniature, stabbing through a man's throat and up through his tongue and out his mouth. I mean, seriously...Scream wasn't this gross and it was a horror movie.<br /><br />The movie wraps up with our intrepid cops blowing up a bunch of old people.  Which is either hilarious or a little tiresome, depending on what you thought of the film up to that point.<br /><br />Although the interaction between Angel and Butterman are entertaining, Hot Fuzz's pacing is uneven, which is a shame.  Pegg and Wright's enthusiasm for the genre is infectious, but in this case they'd be better off renting cop movies than making one.<br /><br />Those church spire scenes still give me nightmares. *shudder*time in miniature, stabbing through a man's throat and up through his tongue and out his mouth.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Alfred Hitchock has one of the best and most enduring filmographies of all time.  From early successses like [[ASIN:B00000CQK0 The Man Who Knew Too Much]] and [[ASIN:0780021967 The 39 Steps - Criterion Collection]] to his later years masterpieces like [[ASIN:0783226055 Vertigo (Collector's Edition)]], [[ASIN:B0002IQEHI North By Northwest]] and [[ASIN:0783225849 Psycho (Collector's Edition)]], Hitchcock is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in history.    Rear Window is nothing short of a masterpiece.  A movie set in and around the front window of a man in a wheelchair.  This entire movie, from the shots inside and outside of the window, to the superb acting from James Stewart and Grace Kelly, to the use of only diegetic to set the mood.  A wonderful movie.    One of the greatest of all times.    Must Have.    I also recommend: [[ASIN:B0002HOERG Strangers on a Train (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000CCW2U2 Marnie]], and [[ASIN:B000ECX0O2 Rope]].

The \\"Brimstone and Treacle\\" Tracks aren't available on MIAB and none of the \\"Ghost In The Machine\\" Demos either. There needs to be a Complete Police anthology for all of us die hard Police fans. We already own everything they have ever done plus a plethera of Sting's solo music. We really would love to see a real Anthology. Here's hoping they do the unplugged session they postponed on MTV and it ends up on a much more complete anthology too. Talk of a new album is being discussed as well.But this anthology will intoduce The Police to a lot of younger fans who have started to catch on to their wonderful music.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|Wow of all the movies I have owned high def or not this is the best.  The thing aboout this movie is that when you think its over its just getting started!  This movie looks great in blu-ray [best looking title besides apocalypto]but i dont know how the audio is because i dont have a setup but from just my tv speakers[a 42 in. sharp aquos] it sounds amazing!  so do yourself a favor and buy this blu-ray title .

B000SFZ05C|4.0|I expected to be very disappointed by this album. Another literary reference for a title, from a Bukowski poem and Nietzsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" for the last album. (Ian, we get it , you read). Then, the first time I heard \\"Dirty Little Rockstar\\" it sounded like The Cult covering INXS covering the Stones, \\"Undercover of the Night\\".     Nonetheless, I\\"m converted.     \\"I Assassin\\" and \\"Illuminated\\" instantly caught my attention and all but 2 of the other songs are rapidly growing on me. Granted, there are no riffs or solos that are gonna make any guitar players envious, but the album still stands on its own merits. I think the comparisons to \\"Love\\" and \\"Electric\\" are overblown. \\"Born Into This\\" sounds more like their under-rated, self-titled album with a few throwbacks to \\"Love\\". That's good enough for me.     Now if Ian would just lose the bandana and work the crowd when they tour.
B00004RFCM|5.0|From the my first viewing of Sex in the City on HBO, I was smitten.  My husband remarked that he felt like a fly on the wall listening to what women talk about to each other.  He loved Samantha but later settled on Charlot as his favorite caracture.  I started out liking Carrie, but also ended liking Charlot best for her womanity but admiring Maranda for her no non-sense views.  The first series is great, and to see the episodes uncut and uncensored makes the humor.  I bought this for my husband and will get the whole set.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|In the late 19th century in India, a man-cub named Mowgali was raised by wolves in the jungles and its now the dreaded tiger Shere Khan (voiced by George Sanders) has returned to the jungle and vows to kill the man-cub. So it's wise panther Bagheera (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) to take him to a man village where he would be safe until Mowgali runs into a lovable jungle bum bear named Baloo (Phil Harris) befriends him and goes on a journey from the ruins of jazzy orangutan King Louie (voiced by Louis Prima), the wraith of a hypnotic snake named Kaa (voiced by Sterling Holloway) and finally a battle with Shere Khan.<br /><br />One of disney's most entertaining and greatest movies ever! This was the last animated movie to be supervised by Walt Disney himself long before he died. Adapated from Rudyard Kipling's novel of the same name and from the stories of \\"Mowgali\\", this is a charming and exciting animated movie flowing with excellent animation and memorable songs like \\"I wanna be like you\\" and \\"Bear Necessities\\". Truly a must have for every collection of animation or for family's library.<br /><br />The picture and sound quality is phenomenal on this DVD and there's excellent extras like audio commentary, a new \\"I wanna be like you\\" music vudei, interactive jungle cruise, A documentary on the making of this movie, four featurettes, games, deleted scene with deleted character, deleted songs and art galleries.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I saw \\"Grindhouse\\" twice in theaters and it still remains one of my top movie going experiences of 2007. Both Tarantino's \\"DEATH PROOF\\" and Rodriguez's \\"PLANET TERROR\\" are amazingly fun and amazingly flawed movies, but when mashed together in a faux double feature with faux trailers was awesome.    But DEATH PROOF and PLANET TERROR as standalone movies? Eh, not so much. DEATH PROOF is kind of Tarantino's swan song / love song to himself. Every thing is a reference to everything else. True, Tarantino made his bones on the backs of \\"homages\\", but when he starts recreating his own famous movie moments (for instance almost a shot for shot redux of RESERVOIR DOGS' diner scene) he just seems like a director out of gas. His dialogue just drags on too long and becomes even the geekiest of film geeks. The storytelling is just plain rough and jumpy.    The last twenty minutes of DEATH PROOF are incredible and sad. Sad because you realized DEATH PROOF could've been a lot more than what Tarantino end up making.    Really, \\"GRINDHOUSE\\" is not the same split up onto two DVDs and marketed as two seperate movies. The appeal and novelity are gone. Normally I don't mind the Studio DVD double dip, but this time around it feels like the Weinstein COmpany is simply butchering a great film experience to make some money. Why not at least offer a special collector's edition of GRINDHOUSE with both the theatrical cut and the special editions of both films on four discs? I know I would've gladly paid $60 for that.     Personally, I'd pass until the Weinstein Company smartens up and puts out a collector's edition of GRINDHOUSE. Neitherthe Death Proof or Planet DVD is really worth full price since all you are getting is half a movie concept.
B00005JPQL|5.0|This movie is 'star'tacular!  It was surprisingly refreshing for a fantasy-adventure film.  The story takes unexpected turns, offers fun for the whole family, and is definitely funny.  I laughed 'til I cried.  It is a movie for all ages (parents permitting of course), and both men and women will enjoy it equally.  The movie has a great balance of action and romance.  There are scenes full of suspense and dark humor, and then a sweet unexpected moment will pop up.  The effects are great, and it is actually well-acted.  The ending is a bit predictable, but this is offset by the many unexpected moments throughout the movie, and who wants a sad ending to a fairytale anyway?  My husband wanted to see it again this weekend, but unfortunately it is out of the theaters here in central VA.  We both loved it, and we can't wait for it to come out on DVD so we can see it again!!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is my favorite series on TV.  I went so far as to order Showtime to see season 2 even tho they offer lousy movies.  The acting and writing are amazing.  Great job, Dexter.  We're rooting for you!
B000AADYYO|4.0|Few metal bands these days gain such serious respect from me , and Opeth is one of those few, and this album is simply well done.<br /><br />It opens with nearly unparralled ferocity. The entire album paints a vividly dark and beautiful picture for my mind, like im walking down halls of an empty castle or mansion, investigating rooms of all kinds, opening doors, looking through antiques and old photos and letters and such, seeking or being sought by, the souls of those whole lived here many many years ago. Physically alone, but spiritually accompanied through out this tour, as it were.<br /><br />The instruments in this album are like brushes for the dim canvass, that lights up like lit candles in a pitch black corridor, or library.<br /><br />The architecture of each song is nearly as beautifull as the ancient architecture i see in my mind. You must get the album it self to look at the artwork, it truly expresses whats within the music, its feeling.<br />Look at the cover art alone. This is one of those albums that lives up to the beautifull cover art, it suits the songs well.<br /><br />The songs are lengthy, deep, and thoughtfull, like an intimate story, thats hauntingly gentle and menacing brutal at the same time. In a word...Powerfull.<br /><br />Ghost Reveries is a piece of art. Giving you an experience that is both complex and simplistic. Reflective. Dark. Beautifull. Unfolds like an antique scroll.<br /><br />This could be considered a classic; it has a timeless, wonderously dark sound, thats performed very well. And the singing is very fine, from clean passages to monsterous disclosures. This album and band command one's respect without asking for any.<br /><br />As the album closes, i felt as if i was wandering out of a big enchanting garden at twilight. My venturing was soon to be over, and i had to leave this place, with all its elaborate furnishings, tapestries, and stained glass.<br /><br />Now thats the imagery i saw in my head, and the guitars and keyboards and drums and singing, depicted all this for me, like dream or a vision.<br /><br />I want to give this album:<br />4 and 1/2 stars!<br /><br />( i didnt give it 5 becouse there wasnt enuff very memorable tracks, though all of the tracks a very well done. I just save 5 stars for the stuff that is very very inspiring and moving to me personally. And this album comes close.)<br /><br />This album is worth owning and experiencing.

B000001GX5|3.0|Overall a superior recording.  I have to agree that the tempo in a bit sluggish on the Pines of Rome, especially the fourth section, the Via Appia.  The sound was almost too well blended.  I'm used to hearing a bit more of the dissonance right before the final triumphal resolution.  It doesn't last long but serves to punctuate the long build up in other recordings.  That brief dissonance seems to be glossed over by Karajan, which makes the resolution less compelling.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Ok so the new singer isn't as strong or as good as Tarja..........were you really expecting her to be?  ANyway she is actually quite good but the strength of this album lies within the music. The band is sounding a lot more progressive and heavier than ever and I like the direction that the music is going. They still maintain the beautiful melodies that they were always known for. I don't understand how some reviewers say they have gone in a mainstream direction.........the first track is 13 minutes long; HELLO!!! This far from mainstream or pop or a sellout band. The new record rules.....welcome back Nightwish!!! :)

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|No movie based on a P.K.Dick story can be entirely without interest. The concept of looking two minutes into the future is a good basis for an interesting plot. This movie has quite a few good scenes exploring it. Best is of course the diner scene when Cage gets to know Biel.<br />The weakness of the movie is the lack of plot for the terror scenario. It is not enough to take a bunch of different young Europeans and some Asians and let them handle something which is said to be a nuclear device. Actually this part is like a simple copy of 'Die Hard IV', but without bothering to explain the who and why.<br />So let us send the producers of this movie back to the drawing board. With a good script writer, something could be made out of this story.

B00000DOYR|5.0|Back in Black remains the definitive AC/DC album 27 years on. So many fans in 1980 (us Australians in particular) questioned if anyone could take the place of our beloved Bon Scott and (to borrow a line) his  \\"blood-curdling battle cry\\". What was delivered was a masterpiece. The dark opening bell chime and guitar riff and the line \\"Rolling Thunder, Pouring Rain\\" from 'Hells Bells' immediately makes us spare a thought for our fallen idol. Then the album kicks into overdrive. From 'Back in Black' and those amazing guitar riffs emulated by teenagers in bedrooms & garages worldwide, The Aussie male's torch song 'You shook me all night long', to the call to war against the establishment cry of 'Rock n roll ain't noise pollution' this album has it all. No two tracks are alike, and to this day no other recording from any other Australian artist compares.

Nuances in the music seem to be more pronounced, better defined bass extension with less distortion, all in all seems to be a higher resolution version.
0143038583|1.0|This book, which repeats so much already published, basically follows through to its initial premise:  that food in america is unsustainable.  Along the way, the author indulges himself in great celebrity and ego stroking wit.  The segment on the boar hunting is quite hypocritical.  The main thrust of the author's theory is that all systems, including alternative, are unsustainable.  The conclusion he avoids, is that the failure to find a solution will result in many deaths, if not the extinction of human culture as we know it.  Perhaps, all that anyone can learn here is that it is hopeless, go back home, accept your fat and your fate, and try to die quietly.  So many other books are better than this one.  Unless you are a total newbie to these debates, you will find little that is refreshing here.  The author basically finishes where he begins, with nothing but personal insights, and no insight into a broader solution for \\"sustainable\\" food sources.
B000EPFPYW|3.0|For the record this disc is nothing more than the US version rebadged with obi-strip. Once you open the cd and get past the manufacturer's seal you'll soon learn that the obi strip is there to basically hide the fact that its nothing more than a US release in disguise. Save yourself the money and buy the US release since there is nothing different from the two. BMG should be ashamed of themselves for doing such an unscrupulous thing and exploiting the concept of an \\"import\\" and offering nothing for it!

I love the piano and the lush sound of the other instruments, synthesized though they may be. Bob Sheppard's alto sax compliments the surprisingly organic sounds of the synthesized instruments. She does a good job on the instrumentation though I would love to hear it with all real instruments. I love the recording of the piano, it sounds great!<br /><br />This Place: That voice! Her voice is so expressive and unique. I never get tired of it. Her other instrumentation is every bit as unique and interesting as her guitar playing. This song has such a wide open arrangement, with the steel guitar reverberating in the back ground. It really gives you a feeling of open spaces.<br /><br />If I Had A Heart: If I had a heart it would break at this song. Another beautiful, lush arrangement. The lyrics are haunting in these times of war and greed. Her phrasing is, as usual, wonderful. It's like her piano and vocals are performing a dance with the other instruments.<br /><br />Hana: Wow! This track catches you off guard after the first three. I listen to all sorts of music, so combining elements from different genres is always interesting to me. The percussion sounds like it came from The Prodigy. With the slightly distorted kick drum, to the constant shaker it drives the song along nicely. Another gorgeous, lush arrangement, but this time interspersed with distorted sounds. Bob Sheppard's soprano sax sounds playful and jazzy at times. \\"Light the lamp.\\"<br /><br />Bad Dreams: \\"The cell phone zombies babble through the shopping malls\\" This song is a place of rest after Hana. While it is lush and peaceful, lyrically it may just fill your heart with despair. Haunting is the word I would choose to describe this one.<br /><br />Big Yellow Taxi (2007): One wonders if she did this reworking of her classic tune to reclaim some ownership of it. Hearing this one there can be no doubt that it is hers. It's refreshing and organic, and it easily makes one forget the Amy Grant and Counting Crows versions of more recent years. She has such a wonderful knack for arrangements that you would never think would go with the lyrics, and this is such an arrangement. I'll never forget the version of Woodstock from Shadows And Light, it gave me the same feeling of a song being bourn anew. The message is as relevant today as when it was first released.<br /><br />Night of The Iguana: Brian Blade's drums and Larry Klein's bass are the heartbeat of this one. The rest of the instrumentation is the blood. Joni's voice is the breath. You can visualize the scenes she paints with the brush of her words.<br /><br />Strong and Wrong: Such a soft voice making such strong statements. Such emotion in the melodies, harmony, and instrumentation.<br /><br />Shine: This song is basically a prayer and would be even without words. Sonically it reminds me of Sting's take on Little Wing from ...Nothing Like The Sun or Chick Corea and his Elektric Band II performing Space from the Paint The World album. Very open, peaceful and soothing. Like all the other songs on this album, it will make you think.<br /><br />If: This song is probably the most radio friendly of the album, but that doesn't make it bad in any way. It's just more conventional in it's sound. It still has that lush, jazzy sound, but is more traditional in it's presentation. I've been listening to a lot of Steely Dan recently and this reminds me of some of their stuff. Pop with a jazz sensibility.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.(2007): One wonders if she did this reworking of her classic tune to reclaim some ownership of it.

0743289684|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. It is enriching and enlightening to us Westerners who mistakenly believe that Islam is a religion of peace hijacked by a handful of extremists. It's understandable how so many people believe that, trying to extend an olive branch and maintain peace. Unfortunately, it's just not true. And that's what the primary message of this book is. The great issue of our time is how to adapt Islam into the global system with the least possible bloodshed.
B000099T2L|5.0|Crazy In Love is hot, as is Naughty Girl, Baby Boy, Signs is great, Speechless is one of the best modern contemporary ballads I've ever heard, Dangerously In Love 2 is better than the original, grew on me and is the second best track here, Gift From Virgo is one of the most insightful yet heartfelt interludes I've ever heard and Daddy and Yes are fantastic. Especially the former.<br /><br />Yes is great though because it's a kiss off and I LOVE kiss-offs, especially by females. Ne-Yo did one too, on his current album, Because Of You named Go On Girl and is easily one of the highlights of the CD and made a great closer.<br /><br />To me, this is one of the greatest albums that blends R&B and Pop songs alike. Similar in vein to Brandy's Never Say Never and Tracie Spencer's Tracie album. But Tracie couldn't do it as well.<br /><br />Favorites in order: Daddy, Dangerously In Love 2, Gift From Virgo, Baby Boi, The Closer I Get To You & Signs.<br /><br />No filler whatsoever although Hip Hop Star is somewhat of a head scratcher that grew on me lots.<br /><br />69.75/15 = 4.65<br /><br />4.65 stars.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It's not Lateralus, and that's a good thing.  Who wants to hear the same album again (albeit a great album!).  However it is a masterful album that shows Tool's continuous progression in music.  With each album, Tool maintain their identity and sound, but increase the artistic component of the compositions.  The songs on 10,000 Days are still rhythmically tricky, but not as overly complex as Lateralus; songs like Vicarious and Rosetta Stoned rock like anything from AEnima or Undertow, but there is a primal nature to this album, that sets it apart from previous Tool albums.     The interludes, which Tool is famous for, have been taken to a new level on this album.   They are more integral to the album than in the past- I used to think of them more as filler material until now.  These mini- compositions are somehow \\"smarter\\" than what we have heard before.  I have always been a Tool fan, and have found that their albums (as far as this genre is concerned) have a timeless sound to them, and each album seems to improve on that quality.  10,000 Days certainly has nailed that.  I'll be listening to this album for a long time.
B0000683DH|5.0|Star Trek II is definitely a classic; I would call it the best of the films by a slight margin.  The reason for my post, though, is the collector's edition DVDs of the movies.  The content is great; the movies all look and sound great, and the bonus documentaries and what have you are really interesting.  However, I've noticed that more recent copies of the movies don't have a booklet, and instead of nice picture discs, the discs are now just plain silver.  Does anyone know why this is; have any comments?
B000MRA5EM|1.0|I am definitely a Howard Hall fan.  His work in such films as Underwaterworld and the earlier IMAX film on the Island of the Sharks (Cocos Island) was outstanding.  However, the production of this film is really a problem.  A lot of the earlier clips suffer from a blue/red syndrome (poor color balance), perhaps in part due to the 3D production (did it use color glasses?).  The narration is limited in effect if not outright silly in places, and although I admire both Kate Winslet and Johnny Depp on their own, they really didn't fit the material here.  It had a lot of the old True Life Adventure (Disney) feel, I must admit.  The alternation between their voices made no sense at all.  Definitely not a dialog, so why do it?  The music track greatly interfered with the video production, and was very distracting and annoying at times.  I am donating my copy to the local library; maybe somebody else can enjoy it for what it is.  There are a lot of much better ocean DVDs out there, starting with the BBC Blue Planet series.
0143038419|5.0|For those who read the book and say..I can't afford to travel the world....HELLO!!!! that is soooooo not what the author is telling you to do. Actually she is telling you to NOT do that, then it won't be YOUR journey. You can't take HER spiritual journey, that makes no sense. The fact that she had money and options should tell you a few things....One,money doesn't bring you happiness; Two: stuff can happen to anyone: Three:that you have to go down to go up. A spiritual journey is a private and awe inspiring thing. I am still in the midst of mine, and it didn't require a trip around the world. I am glad that this lady was able to do that...good for her! I would love to eat my way through Italy.<br />A spiritual journey is a different journey for each of us, some longer, some shorter. Some right in their own home, and some half way around he world. I have been able to quit my day job, as they say...and if I wanted to ,I could stay up all night and cry on the floor....but I don't want to , nor have to...why??? Because I am well on my spiritual journey.<br />Kudos for the author to put out the amazing journey she was able to take...and shame on those who are jealous of her for doing so. You don't need a map of India to go on a spiritual jorney, but it may help! This lady may have needed to travel around the world to keep her on track. Don't be jealous, but take your journey....just use the author's enthusiasm  and authenticity to help get you started!<br />A spiritual journey is a long and difficult thing...it requires a positive attitude, hope, self respect and belief...it also strengthens these things, and enlarges your life.<br />This book shows you that it can be done, and how this lady did it. It isn't a 12 step program to earn you enlightenment...only you can make your plan for how YOU can get to enlightenment...but it is certainly worth the journey. If you want the hand holding 12 step program, this book isn't for you. It is a diary of sorts to give you ideas, hope, and inspiration!<br />Enjoy the read and take the journey from your favorite reading spot...get lost in other countries and hopefully in other consciousness!tion!  Enjoy the read and take the journey from your favorite reading spot...get lost in other countries and hopefully in other consciousness!

She just knows she wants to move, to be somewhere else.     I had heard that the book was inspiring, which was true. I was unprepared for the fact it was also pretty funny. The author is able to turn a phrase, and I'd put her among the ranks of the funniest female writers, almost approaching Nora Rphron or a Fran Lebowitz.     I do feel the criticisms that the author comes across as self serving are true. I wish the author had turned less of the focus on herself. Nevertheless, if you enjoy free form essay writing, basically a forgotten art, check this book out.     Another excellent book of humorous essays is Race You To The Fountain of Youth, which had me rolling on the floor. [[ASIN:1416543996 Race You to the Fountain of Youth: I'm Not Dead Yet (But parts of me are going fast)]]    \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" is truly an interesting collection of essays and was fresh and different.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I watched (in amazement) all of these episodes as they aired in HD on TV, but my wife bought me this set for my birthday.  The picture is even better (PS3 on a 42\\" Westinghouse 1080p) and the different narrator is easier to listen to in my opinion.  Anyway, despite the complaints from other reviewers about missing \\"bonus\\" material, I'd never trade the amazing clarity for some \\"extras\\".
B000244EMO|3.0|Let me start this off by saying I am not Arnold Schwarzenegger's biggest fan. I've only enjoyed a handful of his movies, with Predator being one of them.    The DVD was off to a good start with great opening menu animation. I have a habit of checking out the special features first before diving into the movie, and I was very happy with the number of behind the scenes featurettes in the second disc. Considering this movie was made before the age of DVDs, it is fortunate that 20th Century Fox managed to archive so much behind the scenes footage.    My favorite special feature is the text commentary in the first disc. I have been a big fan of text commentaries, ever since I first discovered them in the Star Trek Special Edition DVDs. This commentary is chock full of great information as well as interviews with the crew.    The only thing that let me down is the video. It is soft, grainy, and bland. Not the sort of thing one expects from a DVD. It is barely better than a LaserDisc transfer. Would it have been so difficult or expensive for 20th Century Fox to throw in a proper digital restoration? After all, this is one of the great action flicks of the 20th century!
1591840562|5.0|This book is great for getting anything started.  Very easy to read and to the point.  Anyone can use this book to start anything.  Details to look for.  I also liked that I could read the first chapter on line before purchasing it.

Incredible documentary. The best yet. Yes, it was an astounding life, time, rise to fame, reshaping of American music of many generes, but for what good end? You gotta serve somebody. You gotta serve somebody... he was just a freeking kid. How many songs really meant nothing? like \\"When The Ship Comes In?\\" written in \\"retaliation\\" over a refused hotel room. Yet we swallowed it all.
157330087X|4.0|I think most of the reviews here miss the point of what this concert was about.  It wasn't about \\"Jimmie Vaughan getting to share the stage with bigger names\\" or lining up the best blues artists to showcase them.  Stevie died the night after performing at a blues festival in Alpine Valley Wisconsin...(hence the opening lines to \\"Six Strings Down\\")...who else performed at that festival? Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, Jimmie Vaughan...you get the picture?  The tribute was about the artists that shared the stage with him that fateful night (and on previous tours) coming together to honor their colleague and share his memory.  The idea was conceived by Art Neville and Jimmie Vaughan a few years after Stevie's death.  There were thoughts of this within a year or two, but Jimmie had felt that was too soon.  After a certain time of mourning, Jimmie and Art decided to round up this cast and have the tribute concert...not only to honor Stevie, but as a form of healing and closure for all of them.      I remember seeing this concert airing on PBS and thought it was wonderful, keeping in mind the tribute and the fellowship that these musicians had together and their previous times sharing the stage with SRV.  That for me makes this DVD worth owning...maybe I'm just an old sentimental nostalgic sap.    I was also fortunate enough to see SRV and Double Trouble in 1988, and at the time they were touring with The Fabulous Thunderbirds...at one point in SRV's set, he invited Jimmie out on stage and they jammed together for a few songs.  A very wonderful moment to share the stage together like that when they were both at the apex of their careers.  Yes SRV was far more talented, but of course they loved each other as brothers and in fact it was Jimmie that initially taught Stevie how to play the guitar.  Of course in time Stevie the pupil far surpassed his teacher, and the rest is history.    So slam the talent and the stage energy if you want, but this DVD is about far morethan that.  It's about remembering a legend who died far too soon.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|\\"Zodiac\\" takes the lives of several people associated with the notorious serial killer of the same pseudonym and, over the course of thirty years, charts their efforts and involvements with the case.     The first thing I noticed when watching \\"Zodiac\\" is the direction: David Fichter, masterful genius behind other such thrillers as \\"Se7en\\", \\"Fight Club\\", and \\"Panic Room\\", weaves a beguiling sense of glossy mainstream Hollywood - there's a surreality and a sense of plastic-fantastic to the desaturated, yellowish shots and beautifully disconnected panoramas of San Francisco Bay - and then firmly and squarely yanks the rug out from under our feet with some very visceral murder scenes. His clever use of claustrophobic camerawork during interior and conversation set-pieces serves to further our connection both with Zodiac's victims and the movie's heroes, and the entire movie runs at a deliberately languid pace. It's certainly no tense slash-n'-hack thriller, but David Fichter's talent behind the camera means that \\"Zodiac\\" rewards us instead with a thoroughly absorbing 157 minutes.    Acting-wise, there aren't any weak points: Mark Ruffalo, Robert Downey Jr. and Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent to a man, receive more than ample support from Chloë Sevigny, Anthony Edwards and Brian Cox, with John Carroll Lynch giving a fantastic performance as Arthur Leigh Allen. In sum, the acting in \\"Zodiac\\" is more than a match for the fantastic direction. Similarly, James Vanderbilt's screenplay, from the original Robert Graysmith book, is top-drawer: as someone unfamiliar with the Zodiac murders I was kept guessing until the final frames, and that, to me, is the mark of a great thriller.    All in all, \\"Zodiac\\" is one of the across-the-board best films I've seen in a long time. Thoroughly recommended.
141694740X|4.0|Many years ago the term was \\"GU (geographically undesireable)\\".  I always said that if you lived 500 miles away and a man was into you, he'd make the trip and if you lived next door and he wasn't into you, it'd be too far to go.  I never bought or read this book as I thought the male author was just pompous and sarcastic about women.  But, read it in a waiting room and got to laugh out loud and enjoyed the style and bluntness of the responses (even if the letters were made up).  I have always wondered why women can be intelligent, attractive, interesting and interested but, when a man walks into her life (or into the room or into view of her), she becomes willing to settle for whatever crumbs he throws her way.  Even in a work environment, women support men over women!  Wake up ladies, they don't give up their friends or lives for us.  Why do we feel we must?  (No, not ALL of us, but damn near all!).
B00000HZFH|5.0|Hello, world,<br />  Really nice album, learned about through Band Of Horses fate. Very bipolar voice which is easy to pick up on once you hear enough of that type of voice. As my Mum always says 2 personalities are better than one. Which is a very interesting theory.
B000R9J3X4|2.0|Don't get me wrong: this compilation is a good selection from their music and the remixes second disc is quite interesting.    So where's the problem: I don't like how this CD sounds. The volume level is very high and even if there's no obvious distortion the music doesn't sounds clear.    I'm not a Garbage fanboy but I think I know how their music should sound. I mean I think this edition is bad remastered and it's prioritized the loud and the 'make noise' effect over the detail.    Or maybe I'm wrong and this CD sounds like it should be...
B000F5GO0A|5.0|Hello World,<br />  Really \\"natural gypsy\\" easy going album. I dont know sh%T about this band but I love 16HP and Lilium and such. I drove me Mum home from the mental hospital in Florda and when I hit Carolina I heard \\"Postcards from Italy\\" and was really taken by it. So I emailed the radio station when I got home and 3 days later they gave me the band info. Very clean and true music. FJE Note: nuet. milk hot. is a sick and crappy band
B000NVTHR8|5.0|Hello,    While in Chile this year a young lady introduced me to their lush and heavy sounds of symphonic collusion with a heavy metal band. This album completely blows the doors off of anything else that I've ever heard. They are touring in the US right now and I want to do anything that I can to see them while they come around here. Buy this CD. See them live, as they are my new favorite band!    They are in the same genre/vein as Nightwish and some other amazing and talented symphonic metal bands and this genre seems to have all of the most interesting elements of something that I wish more people could commercially appreciate. None the less, they now have a dedicated fan and I'll make an effort to purchase more as a result of this experience. If you want to check out this band and want to do it first, this is a great way to lose your After Forever Virginity! I'd have to say that my favorite song on the album is Energize Me and you can find the video on Youtube as well.
0385338902|5.0|I have read everything by Jonathan Trooper, as I find him to be an engaging author. His characters are so real and the family dysfunction he describes is a mixture of pathos and comedy. The relationship he has with his twin sister,Russ, his dead wife's son, the dementia of his dad, the pill popping mom and the lost child younger sister kept me up late at night reading.<br /><br />I can understand why film directors are bidding for the rights to this wonderful book about the life of a widower and his struggle to cope with the loss of the love of his life Hailey,and the need to move on with his life in spite of his grief.  I found myself both laughing and sad at the same time. I loved this book.<br /><br />Trooper is a winning writer!
B000URDEB0|5.0|I found the video for Amaranth on Youtube and I haven't been able to get this song out of my head. With all the elements of progressive rock and a beautiful symphonic composition, this band shines on all possible elments. The technical prowess rivals any prog. band and the vocal composition is extremely original even in the grenre and the syllabic cadance is unique. The choral harmonies are engaging and while not as rhyming as other styles of music are as profoundly evocative and catchy as anything else that I've heard.     I don't want to stop listening to this album and its artistic influences are diverse. The guitar shredding and cookie monster male voicing add a grit that is interseting to listen to but Anette Olson's vocals continue to haunt my mind even while I'm sleeping! Buy this album-- it is unlike anything you've ever heard.    When I think about other things that I could say about this, this is my first purchase from Nightwish and if you're looking for an introduction to symphonic power gothic metal this would be a good starter album since its full of amazing sounds. Heavy. Etheral. Haunting. Buy This CD!

0446677450|2.0|I fail to see why this book is so popular. \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\" provides no guidance on how to go about doing the things Kiyosaki suggests. He is condescending, repetitive, at times contradictory, and a couple things he suggests are most likely illegal.    According to Kiyosaki there is one simple reason behind the wide income gap between the rich and the poor/middle class. The rich invest in income producing assets while the poor and middle class purchase liabilities.     He provides some advice that is true but most people won't want to hear. Such as academic success does not translate to financial success. Your house is not an asset. Live within your means and stop buying things you can't afford on credit.     While Kiyosaki may not have been born with a silver spoon in his mouth, I think he has really lost touch with what it means to be poor or middle class. One example mentions how he borrowed $10 or $100k from a friend for a real estate deal and therefore without even investing any of his own money made x amount of profit with about 3 hours of work invested. I don't know about you, but I don't have any friends who have that kind of money to lend me, nor do I have that amount myself. And investing in real estate may have been a good idea when this book was initially published, but not so much right now.    My advice: While he does make a few good points, there are better books on the subject. If you feel you absolutely must read this book, get it from the library.

B000LC4B3Y|5.0|I think the reviews of the other site have quite exahustively mentioned the glories of this recording, which in my opinion, have set the standards for the 21st century recording of the work, in terms of performance and clarity of recording.

B000001G6W|1.0|This was my first recording of Beethoven's 9th symphony and it left me cold from the first hearing. Since it was my first recording I judged the work in general from what I heard too. I found it boring and didn't give me anything. Now that I know what a magnificent work it is, after buying many more recordings, I just know what a dull and boring recording this is.   I recently tried to listen to it again. It is beautifully played by the Berlin Philharmonic but it is still cold as ice to me. I even noticed some orchestral detail missing, most notably in the beginning of the first and second movements. I don't know if this is a result of bad mixing (The recordings from the 70s were notorious for their extremely bad mixing. Give me mixing done in the 60s any day), slopping conducting or sloppy playing.  Just after I listened to this recording I put on Klemperer's EMI recording from 1957 and oh boy what a difference. The symphony came alive and the sound opened up, almost like Karajan's was done in mono. The playing by the Philharmonia was simply magnificent and although Klemperer was significantly slower he gave the work so much heart and a soul. The solists on this recording by Karajan were all really great but it doesn't matter much when the conductor ruins the whole thing with his reoccupation with the beauty of the score and none of the heart that this mighty work requires more than anything.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|This movie was gone from the theaters in the blink of an eye - so I took a chance on buying the DVD and was not disappointed.  I love Renee Zellweger's rendition of Beatrix Potter as she combined the right amount of shy reticence with steely independence.  It took tremendous strength of character to move from her parents' home and become her own person, esp. in Victorian times.      The photography and settings are simply out of this world, the story is one that you can watch with the entire family, and the reality of a woman's place during that time makes this a great movie that can generate conversation for all.  My only regret was that the movie was only 90 minutes - I would have loved to have seen more of her later life.
B000SNUMC0|1.0|I've been an IE fan for thirteen years.  IE is my favorite band in the world.  This is why this is so hard for me.  My least favorite IE album is Horror Show.  But after listening to Framming, Horror Show blows it away.  This album stinks.  It so boring and filled with atmosperic interludes that I found myself fast forwarding almost every song.  The only good song is the video Ten Thousand something or other.  The rest are not worthy of be called Iced Earth songs.  Save your money and buy something else or buy it and tell Jon how much it stinks.  I'm very disappointed. There is no magic in this cd.  People praising this cd don't know what they are talking about or don't own other IE cds.  Sorry Jon.
0375842209|5.0|I am at a loss as to how to give the kind of review this book deserves.  It is beautifully written.  It is heart-wrenching and lovely.  It is worth the time and paitence.  It is a story that needs reading.
B000001GRE|4.0|It's difficult to know what to make of this Seventh. After very positive experiences with earlier instalments of the Boulez cycle, particularly the Ninth and Das Lied, I approached it with great expectations that were not quite realized. More even than in other symphonies, Boulez makes eccentric tempo choices, that are within the limits of the tempo markings by Mahler, but often only by a hair's breadth. The first movement is very slow indeed, the main Allegro more an Andante, while the slow introduction is funereal. Articulation seems a bit fuzzy during the introduction, and the ungainly Allegro main theme sounds sluggish and lacking in impulse. After a while, however, the ear adapts and starts to register the heaps of felicitous detail. As ever, structural elements are put in their place unerringly, and climactic points pack a considerable punch. The final, march like incarnation of the main theme sounds thoroughly modern, clad in richly diverse and rhythmically complex percussion sounds.<br />The second and fourth movements are taken extremely fast; Boulez seems to have little patience with Mahler's fairy-tale moods, something that already marred his Minuet and Scherzo in the Third symphony. In this case, I was pleased with the effect on the Andante amoroso, to my ears the least interesting piece Mahler ever wrote: at least it doesn't drag and does not attempt to be the emotional outpouring it so clearly is not. Pointed rhythms and transparent detail do the rest: a truly lovely performance. The same can not be said of the second movement, which is simply too fast. The playing is gorgeous, but the mood isn't there. The Scherzo, however, is excellent, very dark and eerie, with the constant gurgling triplets well defined all through, and at a perfectly judged speed. In the finale, I was immediately struck (if only figuratively) by the very well-defined, very present timpani. I loved this, but it may prove a bit too much on repeated hearing. Boulez holds together this much debated piece pretty well, though the great climax is a dud: there, of all places, the timpani are inaudible (try Chailly instead, who marks the final return of the first movement theme with a roll on a giant drum that Mengelberg had constructed specifically for this one moment!). Nonetheless, most forte passages blaze and shine, while the tongue in cheek ballroom music does not elude Boulez either. Pity his bells blend in with the rest of the orchestra so completely as to be all but inaudible. The recorded sound is rich, detailed, and warm; only was I bothered by somewhat muffled sounding horns, whose stopped notes tend to be lost. Also, there was a printing error on my copy, resulting in two brief silences about 13\\" into the finale.<br /><br />I will return to this recording once in a while for its rich detail and structural insights; but it is not a first choice for anyone wanting a Mahler 7 to live with. For that, try Gielen; or Bernstein (DG), for a no holds barred roller coaster ride. And I wish Philips would reissue Haitinks formidable digital remake with the Concertgebouw Orkest!ch debated piece pretty well, though the great climax is a dud: there, of all places, the timpani are inaudible (try Chailly instead, who marks the final return of the first movement theme with a roll on a giant drum that Mengelberg had constructed specifically for this one moment!).

B00000613T|5.0|It's been a while since I found a Mahler recording so completely engrossing and deeply communicative. The notion that Boulez is a kind of bloodless musical mathematician is as unfounded as it is threadbare; rather, he plumbs the depths of this extraordinary work like few before him, and I couldn't get the music out of my head for days afterwards. Unlike some believe, Mahler's music, especially that of his ascetic late period, is not helped by covering it with big dollops of sentimentality, overwrought drama and wilful agogics. It is, rather, helped by lucidity, truthfulness, an understanding of its architecture, and an ear for important detail. This is what Boulez has on offer, and it results right away in one of the maybe two or three most perfect realizations of the first movement ever. Everything is unbelievably well-focussed, the ebb and flow managed to perfection, the culminating motto theme overwhelmingly powerful, the aftermath poignantly sweet. Few conductors equal Boulez in the way he pulls together the piece by paying attention to the dense thematic cross-references between primary and secondary voices. Few, too, relish like he does the many rhythmic frictions of twos against threes. I cannot but feel that Mahler would have been in raptures over the unbelievable precision of the playing, that yet never sounds academic: a stellar achievement from the CSO.<br /><br />The second movement is hardly less fascinating, though one might find reason to argue with the relations between Tempos I, II and III, the second being too slow and the latter too fast for my taste. Yet the clarity of the realization and the inner coherence of the whole more than make up for this. The Rondo is played less aggressively than seems to be the norm, but with terrific virtuosity and incredible transparency; this is, after all, a spoof on academic counterpoint, dedicated by Mahler to his `brothers in Apollo', and Boulez fully brings out the underlying sarcasm. That said, the end, where the whole thing runs off the mill completely, lacks nothing in sheer hysteria.<br /><br />The flowing tempo of the final Adagio will be cause for complaint to many; it easily knocks 6 to 8 minutes off of most alternative versions, and refuses to indulge sentimental tastes. Yet, we have some indications, not least from Kaplan's studies of the Adagietto from the 5th, that Mahler's `slow' was never meant to be taken to the extremes we have gotten used to. Moreover, the first two pages of the piece are strewn with tempo indications that do not suggest slowness: `straffer im Tempo'; `Fliessend'; `Etwas dr&auml;ngend'. But most importantly, the tempo never sounds wrong; it isn't hurried, but it does draw together the melodic lines, and tautens the argument. The result is exceptionally moving, and has great nobility. It lends the piece an intensity that in itself is a sufficient makeweight for the longer opening movement - I was not at all hindered by the sense of unbalance another reviewer complains about. And then, at the final return to tempo I (just before `Wieder zur&uuml;ckhaltend'), Boulez hauntingly demonstrates his grasp of the overall structure of the symphony by making something heard that is lost in every other recording I know of this piece: the fff unison line of the first and second violins is nothing other than a reprise of the Death motto from the first movement. In the new context it is conquered and rendered harmless, a realization that suffuses the final pages with an emotion that has eluded other conductors.<br /><br />The recorded sound is a good match for the clarity and power of the playing. It is slighlty glaring, but not to a degree that should seriously bother anyone. In all, this Mahler IX is definitely a top recommendation, alongside Zander, Gielen and Pesek.ole thing runs off the mill completely, lacks nothing in sheer hysteria.

B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|So yes...the subject line gives away my entire review: I love this movie. And deservedly so.  I grew up in a time that coined the words \\"hyperspace,\\" \\"The Force\\" and \\"transporter room.\\"  Yet with all the groundbreaking Sci-Fi television and film, no movie has drawn my in like Joss Whedon's \\"Serenity\\" and the series that spawned it, \\"Firefly.\\"    The tale of just how this movie came to be is a gripping rollercoaster tale in itself, but the tales within are where the magic really happens.      And that's one of the charms of this movie - it does't shore up the story with mystic contrivances or delusions of evolved sensibilities.  It's a story of just folk in an unjust and unexpected situation.  It's more Route 66 than it is the Long Island Expressway.  And yet every new locale in the movie supports the story.  Some Sci-Fi takes us places that are so magnificent that you want to pause the movie and just take in the sights.  And while Serenity has some of that, too, the urge to stay and sightsee pales to the urge to see what's next for the characters.    As for the Collector's Edition, you get to glimpse the exitement and loyalty that Captain Reynolds and his crew have generated.  From behind the scenes to stars quite literally singing the praises of their on-screen personas, this is a worthy addition to the collection of those who like a good yarn that rings true.

0316067598|3.0|This book is a 3.5 out of 5.  Its choppy, awkward sentence constructions and the personal vernacular of Mr. Luttrell slow down the book, but are successful in conveying Mr. Lutrell's Texas upbringing and respect for candor.  The book devoted way too much detail to the BUDS/SEAL process, as most readers I suspect already have an appreciation for and knowledge of the SEALs.  For those that don't, then I imagine the imagery and descriptions are fascinating but five rather than thirty pages would have sufficed.  The best part of the book is the reason it was purchased: to understand the assault, the deaths, and the evasion that allowed Mr. Lutrell to live to tell his tale.  I shed tears twice while reading the book.  A measure of a good read, is how successful is the author at conveying emotion?  Do you care about the characters while you read the book?  I did -- and for this I thank Mr. Luttrell.  I understand some believe the book is embellished and I imagine he could not remember everything about his ordeal.  But, if he could not, then in fine fashion he represented his fellow SEALs in sharing their tenacity, their loyalty, and their love for each other during their final moments.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|Having read the book, I was aghast at the violence that predominated in the film and the lack of the messages brought forth in the book. The acting was good, but the direction taken in the film was not that of the author. While the book lacked professional editing, it did have a message that was taken to heart by many. The film belittles the message.
B000URDEB0|5.0|An amazing work. I own all Nightwish albums, and i must say that this one doesn't come short at all. I like the new singer, I like the music, I like the lyrics. Overall, it's a fantastic album for those real Nightwish fans to own (not to those who are still whining about Tarja's departure. The Poet and The Pendulum is one of the best song ever made by Nightwish!<br />also we can find brutal heavy songs like Master Passion Greed!<br />I would keep reviewig but im listening to the album again! for like the 20th time straight! so yeah buy the album! IT WORTH IT! Now im just looking forward to buy Tarja's solo album!!  I Walk Alone isa pretty good song :P
B000AYEL1A|5.0|If for no other reason (and there are many), I love the look and style of the era in which this movie was shot.  This was definitely a timely movie in the day of the super rock groups.  Kristofferson and Streisand both turn in superb performances.  I read somebody, somewhere say that Kristofferson was just phoning in his performance.  No way, the pained expressions and the obvious depression and disgust with the music industry is apparent as he loses his own identity.  Streisand is fantastic and belts out some unforgettable numbers. They surprisingly share very warm/playful/loving chemisty.   Warning....the waterworks always turn on for me during about the last 1/2 hour of the movie.  You know what's to come....you're just hoping it won't.  I never understand people who don't adore this film.
B000088E7Y|5.0|This is indeed my desert island CD.  The only single album I could listen to for the rest of my life.  How it has been as overlooked as it has amazes me.  I've bought copies and sent them to people I thought would share my opinion, only to be greeted with deafening silence in return. I begin to think there must be something wrong with me.  It's brilliant, poetically and musically and culturally.  And you know what, I take back what I said.  It isn't me.  There's something terribly wrong with anyone who doesn't love this album.

I can't remember to much else but I must know the name of this film!  Please will some silent film buff write a comment on this reveiw and help me!    By the way I do enjoy the film Nosferatu and give it 5 stars, very moody and atmospheric. (the same reason I loved the japanese film)

0805079831|4.0|I've been listening to the (abridged) audio version of Ms. Klein's book over the past week. I suspect the parallels she draws between electroshock therapy, torture, and economic \\"reforms\\" may alienate those on the ideological right.    That said, this is an important book, in that it documents (for a lay audience) the anti-democratic (and anti-social) nature of so-called \\"neoliberalism.\\" Hayek and Friedman may well have held human freedom as their highest goal, but their inability, their unwillingness to see past their narrow ideology, their fetishism of capital and the individual, led them to promote some of the most violently anti-democratic and anti-freedom policies the world has seen since feudalism.    As Ms. Klein documents, the so-called \\"freedom\\" of Friedman's free-market economics has been - and still is - repeatedly (and quite predictably) abused by the few who have the connections and capital to play in that system.    If absolute power corrupts absolutely, then Friedman and Hayek's absolutist views on the world corrupted them and their followers so absolutely that they refuse to acknowledge the great violence they have done to the goal of human liberation.    Many thanks to Ms. Klein for taking the time and effort to document this travesty for those of us who did not join that cult.

B000V8I2QU|4.0|Without having read any reviews here, let me say that Magic could have been a follow-up to Born In The USA. It just has that sound and feel to it. Magic comes off almost as two separate records, the first half breezy, Beatles/60'S Beach Boys sounding...the 2nd half gets darker and more political..like BITUSA, having people fist pumping to songs despite the lyrical messages. I don't agree with Bruce's politics, but I still enjoy his music. If everyone listened to musicians/actors/etc to form their opinions we'd really be in trouble, being that 99% of entertainers are complete morons when it comes to the real world. Having seen Bruce the last two nights in Philly, I will say the new songs are excellent in a live setting. This is actually a compliment, being that the production of Magic is third rate. All of the instruments are too condensed, where live the band sounds much cleaner. I'm not one to compare albums, I believe artists should follow whatever moves them at the time. That being said, Magic is a strong rock record by the best live performer around. I've heard rumors that Bruce recorded many songs for this release and decided to keep another dozen for a possible Spring 2008 release....here's hoping....

0753821788|4.0|As I read the previous reviews, I find that I share some of the criticisms of the people who hated the book.  And from the reviews, it appears you either love or hate this book.  I was intially put off by the style, that is that the book is told in emails, diary entries, etc.  I find that unnerving and disjointed, and it causes the reader to have to constantly switch gears, so to speak, and I find that much more difficult to read than a straight narrative.  By opening the book with emails, with all that to/from/what time information, I think the writer violated that first of all literary commands:  Hook 'em from the beginning.  (\\"It was a dark and stormy night...\\")  However, there is a point at which you do get hooked, if you can slog through the beginning. So it seems to me that the people who hated the book do so on issues of style.  The people who love the book, including me, do so on issues of content.    There is a great deal of humor in the book, not always subtle as one reviewer suggested.  The Quiz Show scenario, in which a Yemeni citizen wins a dishwasher to take to his non-existent, bombed-out, electricity-free village, is an example.  But the rest of the humor is the kind that makes you smile, rather than laugh out loud.    Ultimately, the book does a stunning job of bringing home the point that none of us know what will happen tomorrow.  We live, love, dream, and make plans based on hope that we will be there to see the dreams and plans come to pass.  But if we don't, the life lived with those hopes and dreams is reward in itself.  The book has an unexpected climax that is quite shattering.  And uplifting at the same time.  So...read this book.  Go for content.  Style is the author's perogative.

Only Sinead O'Connor has been continually able to \\"trip\\" this kind of brilliance with conviction, albeit in such a different way.    Joni--another magnificent, erupting, glorious album. Thank you.

Anne falters at first, but then learns how to excelt at her jon. But the demands of the job and the morally compromising situations she finds herself in put a major strain on her relationships with her boyfriend and her long time friends.    As her life begins to head in the wrong direction, her friends try to save their down to earth friend from being carried away by the demands of her pressing new life.    The movie is well done, a fine adaptation of the best selling novel.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|Bruce is an amazing legend, and that will never be taken away from him.    This album is mind-bogglingly lackluster, even when he tries to be wise and passionate. *Every* track gives the listener the sense that he really didn't want to roll out of bed to make it to the studio.    I'm a little bit stunned, because he is the greatest, and I was expecting some \\"age\\" to show on this effort, but not an utter lack of committment.    And he had to go ahead and call this album \\"Magic.\\"    Aye-yi-yi. It could use some magic. (But I still think he's the best \\"live\\" performer on the globe).    What were you thinking, Boss?
0143038419|5.0|Fantastic book!  Elizabeth Gilbert proves you can by the person you were meant to be and enjoy a life that is satisfying if you are true to  your inner voice.  Her story rings true with so many people who have settled for less and continue experiencing longing.  The events during her travels remind readers that through experience and thoughtful reflection, one does achieve clarity about what is truly meaningful.  I highly recommend this book.
0143034901|4.0|My sister strongly recommended this book when I was visiting her this year. So I picked it up when I saw it being sold at train stations and airports all over Europe.<br /><br />First, I have to say that this was a nearly compulsively pleasant read. The literary equivalent of a hot bath and a glass of red wine. The Shadow of the Wind is a coming of age story with mildly supernatural/mysterious overtones with a strong theme of books and book lovers. In order to ensure that his readers are completely blissed out, Zafon includes romance, gothic family histories and political corruption. There is even a mysterious stranger with a hidden face who may or may not be the devil. Think Anne Rice in some of her better moments, and you'll get the idea.<br /><br />The Shadow of the Wind is a reader's guilty pleasure. It harks pleasantly back to another time. It is evocative. It keeps the pages turning.<br /><br />Sadly, it does not deliver on its promise. That is almost inevitable, given how many doors it opens and how many different themes Zafon tries to keep in the air. There are a few too many implausible ways that the loose ends are tied up in the last third of the book. The resolution is not really as satisfying as I had hoped. The flaws keep The Shadow of the Wind from being a really high quality novel, even though they do not really detract from the entertainment value.<br /><br />In a way, the failure of the end is caused by the magnificent success of the beginning. The first half of the novel was always going to be a hard act to follow. Still, I would more than recommend it for readers willing to take it for what it is-- great entertainment value.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I have to say I was blown away by this album. I was really skeptic when their first sound clips came out with the new singer, and I really didn't think they could pull it off without Tarja. After listening to this CD, I realized even though Anette's voice may not be best suited for metal, the rest of the band is still the same and the songs are even better than before. Their new songs are more hardcore and in my opinion Nightwish DID NOT turn pop or sellout. If you think so, I suggest you listen to the music and forget the singing, and you will realize they are still just as good.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Many are upset that they're not releasing both movies together exactly the way they were shown in the theater, on DVD. The fake movie previews (that I felt were an important part of the movie)are nowhere to be found on either disc also.    I did notice a few differences between this extended version and the theatrical version. One is that we now get to see the missing lap dance footage in the bar. Also we get to see when Stuntman Mike finds the second group of girls. This scene provides knowledge to the viewer that is helpful in putting the whole film together.     While Grindhouse split up Planet Terror and Death Proof for DVD release with the missing reels added.     For those who miss the wacky The Grindhouse double feature complete with the funny previews and intermission check out:     \\"Welcome to the Grindhouse - Black Candles/The Evil\\".     I bought this cool drive-in double feature on one DVD and it was EXACTLY the same as \\"The Grindhouse\\" movie released earlier this year to the theatre!
0805079831|5.0|This book illustrates the context in which we all live. We are all wrapped up in it, and we have to find a way out. The solution the neoliberals and the neocons advocate - privatize, give handouts to corporations, overthrow democracies at home and abroad, wage wars, create crisis, and/or wait for crisis to happen (Katrina), are not only violations of human rights (including the right not to be tortured), but they are not sustainable and have to be stopped. Naomi Klein details the history of neoliberalism from Chile in 1973 to Iraq right now, providing clear and accessible examples, well researched and painfully beautiful sentences that bring home the many wrongs committed by the US in the name of Economic Policy and the Free Market - the only thing truly free is the market, people are of little matter, they can be shocked, their democracies can be intentionally overthrown in order to make their countries more hospitable to American Corporations and if the people should happen to fight back, to speak out, they can be tortured, killed, and disappeared. This book has changed my life. I know one solution to the context of oppression, fear, domination, endless war-creating-for-private-US/Western-profit, is to stop buying things that come from those profiting from neoliberal policies and goals. It won't be easy, because so many corporations are involved in so many ways, but it is a goal that I will strive toward.
0061120081|5.0|It took me to long to finally read this book.  In my school I don't know when I was growing up we never read this book.  Instead I selected it for our book club.    I enjoyed reading this book finally.  I used to hear this was a good read.  Growing up story, with the father at the center helping the children have good moral values. How it is hard for Scout to see her brother grow before her eyes, and they are no longer at the same level.  There is a rape trial which is said when you do research on Harper Lee, that there was a real trial.  That alot the book is based on true events.  I would reccommend this book to be read alone and then discussed with others.

0743496728|5.0|I read this book a few months ago after the VA Tech. shooting it was just coincedental it came out too close to the time. But, also my son is a senior in his HS.  This book was very hard for me to read because of the topic.  It was eary it also because the child was so close to my son's age.  The author was talking about 9/11 and the child was the same age and put into prospective.      The story about a boy who has been bullied every since he was kindergarten. The boy was good friend to his parents friend until he showed a weapon. The parent freaked and did not want him hanging with her daughter.  He stayed friends in secret until high school.  She became popular and wanted to be in the in-crowd, he felt rejected.  He then went to the school and shot everyone in sight.  The story goes back and forth in time to explain all person's involved why this happended.  This is a very good book.  But very hard if you have a HS student.  Do teachers sit back and do nothing.  Or do we the parents have to insist something has to be done.  Why is it some kids just hope it will stop and others just snap.  The book had a lot to say just like her other book sister's keeper.  This book should be read by everyone that is associated with schools.  The parents, teachers, students, etc.    Great book club read.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I certainly can't review this \\"product\\" yet... I just saw this \\"Final Cut\\" at the Ziegfeld theater in New York City, which opened in limited release (unfortunately). The difference from the version I remember is like night and day. Unfortunately a DVD denies one the opportunity to watch it on a 52'x20' screen with an audience of 1200 people. But rather than rub that in, I'll just say that this is a movie that is SO much better now than it was in 1982. Watch it on the largest screen you can get your hands on and invite as many people as you can to watch it with you. Beware of Sean Young's shoulder pads... they're very dangerous.
0394800389|5.0|This is a really fun book to read to your preschool / pre-k child.  It's really enjoyable - both for the parent reading it (for the 10th time) and for the child listening to it. My child loves it. I often buy it as a gift for other children.
0060987464|5.0|This book was fantastic! Ever wonder why Manson is as unusual as he is? READ THIS BOOK. I couldn't put it down. It explains it all. You wouldn't believe all the things he has lived through. This twisted tale turns out to be very insightful and is filled with true reality and wonderful thoughts and quotes. \\" The boy you love, is the man you fear.\\" is just an example. I'm not that great at writing reviews but I can reassure that this book rocks.
B000UJBYD8|5.0|Great inspired songs we have come to expect from these hard rockers The Cult.  Great lyrics and hooks that will leave you wanting more!!!  Couldn't wait to  hear this album and it didn't dissapoint.  The bonus cd and sticker are super cool too!!!  Awesome album, can't wait for the next one.
0553131001|5.0|This is a book I finished in one day. I had to read for my freshmen honors English class over the summer. Lenny and George, two complete opposites manage to stick together and care for each other in the hardest of times. One huge and strong with the mind of an innocent child and one small but with unbelievable streets smarts. The book is very short but well detailed with several surprisingly twist. A Must Read!

0783240287|4.0|The Highs:  + Donny Osmond is the quintessential Joseph - great pipes, perfectly cast.  + Robert Torti steals the show with his hysterical rendition of Pharaoh/Elvis - wow.  + Gerry McIntyre in Calypso scene is a delight.  + Hoe-down dancing scene is full of energy.  + Sets preserve the stage feel of a movie production.    The Lows:  - Inconsistent sound quality.  - Richard Attenborough is a great actor - not a great singer.  - Maria Friedman has sparkle as the narrator, but her singing voice doesn't seem up to the task.  - PG costumes (Mrs Potiphar seduction especially) make this movie not-so-kid-friendly.  - Inappropriate scenes (the Apache dancer was great, but was it really necessary for her to seduce Jacob at the end?).
B00005NNMK|5.0|The band Europe is one of the greatest bands of all time. They mixed pop like vocals which made the songs catchy and the amazing guitar riffs in the back. John Norum the groups guitar player is the greatest guitar player ive ever heard, especially in the two solos of the song ninja and every other solo on the record two. This record is worth the money! Dont pass it up!

B000002H6C|5.0|This was my first Metallica album (actually CD), and it's still awesome.  I love the epic quality of it, with many tracks between 7 and 9 minutes.  The time signatures and riffs are quite complex, making Metallic officially \\"metal prog\\" in my eyes.  There isn't one wasted note here.  Every song really rocks, with special kudos going to Blackened (great way to start the album), the complex title track, the thrashing, brilliantly energetic One, and The Frayed Ends of Sanity (with a killer midsection).  I really dig the lyrics here.  They are some of Hetfield's best (except for To Live is To Die, which was Cliff Burton's final contribution to Metallica).  Eye of the Beholder, One, and the title track are especially potent.  The production of this CD is a bit tinny, with newcomer Jason Newsted's bass buried in the mix.  Supposedly, this was part of a hazing ritual by the other guys in the band, and if it's true, it was idiotic.  Take the new guy out and get him wasted instead, don't f--- with the album.  It's still a great one, but the production should have sounded better.

Ok, 2007 with Bonus Tracks, is a great attractive for fans, but the sound is remixed, with new tones of vocals and others instruments, making a sound different of original versions!    The 2000 version issued by East -West/Elektra in Japan in 2000, is the same sound than 1999 American Elektra reissues, the sound is the same, excellent without any part remixed.  Save your money, buy 1999 American Version, or 2000 Papersleve at used stores as Ebay.     All in all, this 2007 papersleeve contains different OBIS, beautiful, but the remix sound make this a garbage!
0618680004|2.0|In an endnote to the 1989 second edition of \\"The Selfish Gene,\\"  Richard Dawkins commented on astronomers Fred Hoyle and Chandra  Wickramasinghe's characterizations of Darwinism in their publications  arguing for an extraterrestrial origin of terrestrial life:    \\"Publishers should correct the misapprehension that a scholar's  distinction in one field implies authority in another. And as long as  that misapprehension exists, distinguished scholars should resist the  temptation to abuse it.\\" (p. 276 in my 2006 anniversary edition  printing)    Dawkins, a brilliant popularizer of biology and an original thinker in  evolutionary theory, would have done well to heed his own words.  Instead, he has used the reputation he built with his excellent and  massively successful popular science books to secure a publisher, a  wide audience, and an extensive speaking tour for this poorly  thought-out diatribe against religion. I have been a devout atheist  for as long as I can remember and have no fond feelings whatsoever  for religion (organized or not), and because of that I find this book  very disappointing. Even more disappointing is the fact that Dawkins,  using his great fame to promote this book, has become perhaps the most  prominent voice for atheism in the English-speaking world,  overshadowing the far more nuanced, logically sound, and  empirically-grounded work of actual experts on the subject- I would  recommend in particular \\"In Gods We  Trust\\" by Scott Atran, a subtle and multifaceted exploration of the  possible evolutionary origins of religion. It's a phenomenon all too  familiar to scholars in many fields: nuanced, unpolemical, serious  scholarship is overshouted by bombast which appeals to one \\"camp\\" or  another. Unfortunately, many people seem to prefer simplistic answers  to difficult questions.  It is particularly disappointing that \\"The God Delusion\\" lacks almost  all of the rigor, creativity, and cogency of Dawkins's previous books.  It also lacks the graceful writing of Dawkins's other output,  indulging in frequent irrelevant asides and unjustifiably long  sections given over to  Dawkins's own pet peeves. But more importantly, much of the book's  claims are simply lacking in evidence; Dawkins is content with  supporting some very bold claims with nothing more than anecdote or appeals  to his own intuition. There are too many such instances to go into  here, but I will take as example one which Dawkins chooses to harp on:  Dawkins blames religion for much of the conflict in the world, and  claims that  without it the world would be a more peaceful place. Oh, really? As an  atheist, I would indeed prefer that this were true; as a rational  person, though, I must admit that it is impossible to prove with the  evidence available. And some of the most aggressively secular regimes  in history (Lenin, Stalin...) have been among the most destructive,  often in the name of secularism.  I hope Dawkins abandons this second career as an atheist  fundamentalist and returns to writing the popular science we love him  for. For those interested in the debate on atheism, an interesting  exchange can be found here:  [...]

0743451503|5.0|Fitzgerald's farce or satire on upper crust New Yorkers can only be described as being realty becoming greater than fiction.  Proclaiming the story \\"was all true\\", Fitzgerald intimated that this book was something akin to a kiss-and-tell novel about what had happened within America's richest crowd during the time of World War I.<br /><br />\\"Anthony, Maury, and Dick sent in their applications for officers' training-camps and the two latter went about feeling strangely exalted and reproachless; they chattered to each other, like college boys, of war's being the one excuse for, and justification of, the aristocrat, and conjured up an impossible caste of officers, to be composed, it appeared, chiefly of the more attractive alumni of three or four eastern colleges.\\"<br /><br />Princetonian Fitzgerald created a Harvard protagonist Anthony Patch whose birth right is basically his only strong characteristic - at least so at the end of the novel.  During his venerable youth, he locks eyes onto friend Rick's cousin, beautiful Gloria, whose unique spirit and vivaciousness make the self-described bachelor become betrothed.<br /><br />The book follows the couple for a period of just less than a decade, during which time they fall into numerous elations, and depressions. This see-saw bipolar personality/lifestyle depiction is all-too-common in Fitzgerald's novels. Such was well accentuated in Fitzgerald's doctor and patient relationship in  \\"Tender is the Night\\" as the patient is ultimately cured and the doctor falls into a deep feeling of desultory depression -- dipsomania. Another of Fitzgerald's common themes is of men chasing after beautiful women who make the boys feel blushing discomfiture. Well depicted here with Gloria as well as  in \\"This Side of Paradise\\" and its Amory Blaine who constantly trips in his whirlwind attempts to conquer beautiful Rosalind (whose personality and looks mirror those of Gloria).<br /><br />As the book progresses, you see the self esteem of Anthony deflate, while his wife amazingly awaits him to recover, by miracle or otherwise, and be the man she grew to love at the tender age of 22.  Like \\"Tender is the Night\\", alcohol interferes with the person and with his relationships -- Anthony becomes a drunken \\"bore.\\"<br /><br />There are points of this book you have to think - is this a hypothetical autobiography.  Had \\"Tender is the Night\\" bombed instead of won critical acclaim, would not Fitzgerald have fallen into the liquor bottle like Anthony? I am sure he wondered as such.<br /><br />But, as sad as the book can be, Fitzgerald had times of folly and humor. Even a self-deprecating humor. He writes, in one discourse where the people talk disapprovingly about the new novels: \\"You know these new novels make me tired. My God! Everywhere I go some silly girl asks me if I've read `This Side of Paradise.' Are our girls really like that?\\"<br /><br />Amazingly well written, and even more astonishing in that Fitzgerald was 25 years old when he wrote this novel, this book deserves its acclaim and infamy.zingly awaits him to recover, by miracle or otherwise, and be the man she grew to love at the tender age of 22.

B00003CXZ4|3.0|Excellent film / Excellent price.  A must-see x 2 (you'll want to watch it twice.
B0000025KI|3.0|According to my experience, there are three types of double-albums. First you've got the ones that achieve their extra-industrial length by loading themselves up with songs, usually of a wide variety of styles (that's pretty much a guarantee, in fact); second, there are the kinds that balloon to that size through doing the semi-opposite: taking ten to fifteen songs and making them as long as humanly possible. Third and finally, there are those double concept-albums. The River fits into the first category, and in my mind that's its main problem. Too many fun but essentially trivial rockers like \\"Sherry Darling\\"; \\"Two Hearts\\"; \\"Out on the Street\\"; \\"Crush on You\\" (which I'll admit is damn catchy); \\"You Can Look (But You Better Not Touch)\\"; \\"I Wanna Marry You\\"; \\"Cadillac Ranch\\"; \\"I'm a Rocker\\". With the exception of the retro surf-ballad \\"Marry You\\", these all follow a predictable formula: loud guitar intro; rapid-fire verses; feel-good refrain; maybe a sax solo. If you've heard one, you've heard 'em all, so why didn't Bruce just keep it down to one or two of them? \\"Crush on You\\" and \\"I'm a Rocker\\" would've been my picks. And that really detracts from the fact that there's some solid material here, mostly on the ballad side. Take \\"Independence Day\\", about Bruce's relationship with his father; the title ballad, concerning teen pregnancy; or the Latin-jazz cut \\"Point Blank\\". But some of the rockers are great as well, like the sax-packed hit \\"Hungry Heart\\" and the exuberant \\"Ties That Bind\\". But what about \\"Fade Away\\"? The chorus goes, \\"I don't wanna fade away!\\" Now, where have we heard that before? And even without that bit of ripoffness, it's not a very good song in the first place. It seriously isn't. It's just this ultra-boring Adult Contemporary ballad that is like an ancestor to \\"I'm on Fire\\", only not nearly as awesome. And, as much as I hate to say it, \\"Stolen Car\\" is the same way. Shaking the album out of the pseudo-slump is \\"Ramrod\\", which is so much fun I have to call it a keeper. I don't know what makes it better than \\"Cadillac Ranch\\" or something like that, but for some reason I can't fully explain it's one of my favorites on the album. And I like \\"Drive All Night\\", too. Great epic track. Cool sax solos. The ghostly \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" is also a good pick. But there are only eight songs on this album I consider true essential Springsteen classics, and a lot of trivial filler. There are many better Springsteen discs - check The Wild The Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Born in the U.S.A. and Tunnel of Love. I know a lot of people consider this one of Bruce's ultimate albums, but I'm not too sure about that. Then again, I feel the same about Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.o call it a keeper.

0517548232|5.0|This book is not a thorough, complicated review of every aspect of economics. This is a book that explains the fundamentals in easy prose and understandable terms. It won't make you an economist nor will you prepare you for an economics' exam... but it will increase your general knowledge of economics and some of the fundamentals behind the everyday terms you hear. You will really understand the theory behind the jargon. I liked it and thought it was easy to read and understandable. It's relatively short and is good for beginners as well as the more advanced readers in the this area.<br />From the outset, we are explained in this book that the two important issues that make economics less than an exact science (physics, etc.) is the influence of interest groups and balancing the short term needs vs. the long term needs of individuals and the society - very basic and yet so true.

B00005ASHM|5.0|Beatles.....Beach Boys.  Who cares.  Listen to this album from beginning to end.  Forget that its songs have been ravaged for commercial purposes (cheesy movie and t.v. show backup.) and listen.  It doesn't matter who thinks who is better  What matters is that the album is real.  You can feel the emotion whether your 60 or 16.  What makes the album great is not about how influential it was or what a magazine top ten list says.  Its that when the Beach Boys made it, they meant it.
0743496728|4.0|This isn't normally the type of book I would read but I'm glad I picked it up. It wasn't always easy to get through. Ms. Picoult is a good writer but the subject matter was difficult. It definitely helped the reader empathize with someone that had been bullied throughout school. Not that there is ever any justification for what the main character did in the book (as in real life) but I do believe that parents, for the most part, are in the dark as to how their children behave at school. Sometimes I'm not sure they care-as long as their kid is popular and not the victim. I almost felt like purchasing the book for every school teacher in our town! Most teachers have lost touch with their empathy muscle towards their students. When my son was being bullied and didn't want to leave class with the other students, the teacher told him to 'not be a wimp'. We've spent the last week looking for alternative schools from the public school system. The school system is so concerned about how they 'rate' educationally they seem unconcerned about how the kids are doing emotionally.   I can see this book being made into a movie. If it is, I hope it's done well, in a way that will affect positive change. It has the potential to do so.

B000003TAR|5.0|The Nirvana fans are somehow divided in as much as the conception and the perception of Nirvana music is concerned in this case. In my opinion at least. This album brings us a completely new grunge first of all and then a new Nirvana (music) sound. The quality of the recordings on this album is very high and the songs are also great. It is not like Nevermind where we have got four singles on one label but the songs on In utero are also good or at least we should listen to them and try to realize that the band had changed in time and in ambitions, the songwriter (almost on every song) Kurt had had a different points of view in making this album and then the chances are what we have got left here. The good album in any case. The song Serve the servants opens the album with a moaning chorus: 'Serve the servants, oh no!', then the single from this album Heart-shaped box is as good as every Nevermind single (at least it's so to me), Rape me, Dumb and All apologies are what should be called the new Nirvana music and/or sound to all of us and what is expected to be singles in my case. Many good songs, new sound, good recordings quality, inspiring melodies and riffs for every guitar player and/or a music bible for  Nirvana fans. Where should had gone it all we will never know but it might seem the ending of something that was always us and someone who was the one. R.I.P Kurt Cobain.

B00006LJ72|5.0|I had a bunch of Enya albums as copy from friends and MP3's from the internet. The number of Enya songs I collected over the years grew until I realized that I seem to be somewhat of an Enya fan.<br /><br />I found this collection, which resembles all important songs she ever did and more. I checked that, because I wanted to make sure that all my favorites from different albums are included.<br /><br />The price tag is a little bit too high IMO, but it is still cheaper than buying all the individual albums. I had all the songs before, but I wanted to make sure that I pay money to support the artist to continue to create great music.<br /><br />The music is great and the famous songs from the Lord of the Rings movies by Peter Jackson, \\"Only Time\\" and \\"May it be\\" are included as well as the old hit song \\"Orinoco Flow\\".  The music is rich and Enyas voice unforgettable. You won't get any dance beats, but a rich and full melodic and emotional music experience, which is perfect for chilling out and relax from every day stress.<br /><br />I am now looking for the concert DVDs, which seem to unavailable for unknown reasons. Hey, if you don't re-publish them again, when they are out of stock, don't complain if people look for copies on the Internet. There is money left on the table here.
B000002OYB|3.0|After the surprising success of the Bat II album, Meatloaf was back on top playing to huge crowds around the world.  For his follow-up album Meat would move away from the Bat concept and also sever most his ties to Jim Steinman (who only writes two songs on this disc).  In Steinman's place are several collaborators including cliché ridden hit maker Diane Warren and Sammy Hagar among others.  The result is a very average Meatloaf album.  Nothing here is horrible, but there is not a lot that stands out either.  The albums single I'd Lie For You (And That's The Truth) is almost a remake of I Would Do Anything For Love from the Bat II album.  It is ok, but we have been down this road before with Meat.  Other tracks seem to go over equally uneven ground.  I like the song Amnesty Is Granted which is presented as a duet with Sammy Hager.  Hager would go on to record this song himself as well, but I like the version here better.  If This Is The Last Kiss is typical Dianne Warren mush, but the vocal duet between Meat and Patti Russo brings this one to a much higher level than it would normally be.  Where The Rubber Meets The Road is a decent rocker too as is the ballad Not A Dry Eye In The House.  One thing that becomes apparent on this disc are the first hints of deterioration in Meatloaf's voice.  There are songs on here (especially Martha) that sound like he is completely off key and this somewhat detracts from what is kind of a cool song.   Meat's voice is not what it used to be unfortunately.  In the end this album is an ok slice of Meatloaf, but does not rank up with his best.
B000URDEB0|2.0|In my mind Dark Passion Play was an ok CD, it wasn't bad.  But Anette's voice didn't do much for me.  I didn't like the popping sound to her voice. I found her voice plain, and she didn't seem to carry the emotion and feel of the melodies.<br /><br />As for the melody, lyrics and hearing Marco sing.  I give it a 5 star<br /><br />PS.  Seeing some clips of her live as me thinking  \\"What the hell we're they thinking!?\\"  The more I see interviews of her and see her sing live the more I am not impress by her.<br /><br />They should have never picked an untrained singer.  Anette's voice does not give this band justic in every sense of the word.  Her un-professicalizm can be seen on stage. She uses unnerssary slurs in the appemts of reaching the high notes then she then stressing on them and fails by losing her voice.<br /><br />Nightwish's talent over power her in their CD and on stage.  She sings more like someone learning how to sing than the Singer she claims that she is.<br /><br />Anette has said in an interview that she never heard of Nightwish nor was fan of their music, but then condictes herself by saying she did know the band.  So you never quit sure where she stands.<br /><br />She also brags about her \\"So-called talent\\"  By saying: she can sing the old songs, sing with emotion and feeling.  That the guys say she has a wonderful rock voice and this and that.  And that Tuomas said this and that about her singing that she is a professal.<br /><br />When she cliams to have all these WONDERFUL talents, she clearly doesn't show it on the stage or on their CD.<br /><br />There's no signs of her singing rock on the CD.  Or showing any emotion, or feeling.  She sings loudly, but never really sings the high notes. She doesn't open that diaphame.<br /><br />She claims that she feels the music as well, but she doesn't.  She doesn't feel the music that Tuomas writes, because there is no soul and heart in what she sings.<br /><br />She doesn't in NO WAY sound like Simone from Eprica, because she does not have the skills to do anything classical because of her untrain voice.  Same goes with her sounding like Within Temptation's singer.<br /><br />And in my opinons seeing her live.  I know I can now say the band Nightwish now have regrets picking her, espeicallty Tumoas.  Watching them live on youtube, one can tell the band isn't very happy, for they talk behind her back while she sings on stage.<br /><br />Now, I can say, that Anette is probably not going to last long in this band, because she just clashes with the band.  One can tell on their new CD that Marco sings a lot of their songs and she only sing a few on their new CD.  (Quit odd and not good.  If they REALLY liked her they wouldn't have so many guest singers, choirs and instuments or Marco singing to make her sound so good.)<br /><br />And her contract with the band is only 2 and half years.<br /><br />Yes, I know I  going off topic here, but it shows a lot in their CD.  Her soul and heart is not with Nightwish.  She is out of element, she's not comforble singing with them nor does she like to dress the part.<br /><br />I think they picked her too quickly, and I don't think it was a good idea comparing her to the 2,000 some odd demos.  I think Nightwish was not in the right mind of thinking.  If it was me, I would never pick someone that never heard of Nightwish and I wouldn't compare her voice with other demos I would compare her voice with Tarja's.  And if she couldn't sing what I wanted.  Then I would have never picked her.<br /><br />Hopfully, if Nightwish does have to pick a new singer that they demand and tell the world what they are looking for.

B000002WU9|5.0|By far a classic in all the eyes of true hip hop viewers and Wu fans. This was probably one of the best cd's that came out that year hands down in my opinion. And for sure a head banger from start to end.
B000000W5L|4.0|No instant classics on the album but most of the songs are really good.  For sure one of the best albums the stones have done.  The only lacking song is \\"Loving Cup\\".  Other than that it is the most consistent album that they have produced.  \\"Shake Your Hips\\" is one of the best blues rock songs ever done.  That song just cooks.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This has become my favorite cd, I love Bruce and the E Street band, glad they are together again making \\"magic\\" with this album.
B000000OAN|5.0|My sister and her husband gave me A Night At The Opera for my birthday back in 1975. I wore out 3 copies on 8-Track before getting the cassette.  I now have the CD so I can burn as many copies as I like.   Ever since I heard Death On Two Legs for the first time, I was hooked. The entire CD seems to flow. I read another review that said \\"The Prophet's Song\\" was Queen's \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" . It's by far my favorite song by Queen and I'm glad that there's someone else out there that gets it!  Just a wonderful CD!
B000002L7R|4.0|In 1984, Prince released his landmark album entitled \\"Purple Rain\\".   This was one of the all-time great albums.  Not only did it garner critical acclaim, but it held the number one spot for a mindboggling 24 weeks.   \\"Purple Rain\\" was responsible for putting the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" on the map. The \\"Minneapolis Sound\\"  contained a mixture of Funk, Pop, R&B, and Rock.  Prince was largely responsible for being a contributing architect to this new sound movement.  As 1985 came about, Prince had developed a whole new fan base.   Therefore many were extremely happy when Prince surprisingly released his follow-up to \\"Purple Rain\\" entitled \\"Around the World in a Day\\".  For people expecting another \\"Purple Rain\\" they would be very disappointed.   Prince would go in a whole new direction with \\"Around the World in a Day\\".  However, while \\"Purple Rain\\" fans might have been disappointed, the fans of the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" would discover a whole new dimension to Prince's music.    The big difference from \\"Around the World in a Day\\" is the integration of a psychedelic sound.   This psychedelic sound also incorporates some elements of Middle Eastern and Indian influences.   Overall this gives \\"Around the World in a Day\\" a less radio-friendly element than the Rock-Funk infused \\"Purple Rain\\".   While \\"Around the World in a Day\\" was still considered a commercial success, it still fell short in terms of sales versus \\"Purple Rain\\".   Much of this is due to the less-radio friendly nature of this album which resulted in less radio airplay.   \\"Around the World in a Day\\" still incorporates some of the classic \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" elements, but the introduction of the psychedelic element would expand the scope of the \\"Minneapolis Sound\\".   This expansion would soon creep other to other \\"Minneapolis Sound\\" artists.    Here is a song by song synopsis of the nine tracks of \\"Around the World in a Day\\".    \\"Around the World in a Day\\": This is the title track.  For fans of \\"Purple Rain\\", they will soon quickly learn that this is not \\"Purple Rain\\".  The psychedelic element is complete with the Middle Eastern and Indian influences are in full swing.  John L. Nelson - Prince's father would be a co-songwriter on this track.    \\"Paisley Park\\": This song title would eventually become the title for Prince's record company. However this song - still with the psychedelic influence is a very underrated track.  This track could have had radio airplay as a single - but didn't.    There are some great harmonies and a nice violin influence.    \\"Condition of the Heart\\": This song goes more for a classic Piano feel, yet still incorporates psychedelic elements - especially in the near 2 1/2 minute instrumental introduction.  This song takes on more of the form of a narrative.   This is a pure solo effort as Prince does all instrumentals and vocals. Very good track.    \\"Raspberry Beret\\": This was the most radio-friendly song on this collection.  To some extent you can still hear a psychedelic element in the melody on this track.  While I don't think this song is a very strong Prince track, it still isn't a bad one.  The string section is this song is very underrated.    \\"Tamborine\\": This song obviously has a \\"Tamborine\\" in it, but it also going to be a percussion dominated track.  The psychedelic element is in full swing on this.  However this track just didn't do it for me as I found it the weakest on this collection.    \\"America\\": Prince delivers a political commentary on this song.  This song also has a psychedelic element and it is incorporated more into a dance/funk groove.  Not a bad track - especially after a few listens.    \\"Pop Life\\": While this song was also a radio friendly song, it incorporated a stronger psychedelic element.  I happened to think this is the album's best track.  The \\"boxing sounds\\" at the end of this song show that Prince can improvise in a song very well.  Once again Prince integrates a nice String section (this time composed by Revolution bandmates Lisa and Wendy).  Sheila E. also provides the psychedelic sounding drums on this track.    \\"The Ladder\\": Another outstanding track as Prince's father John L. Nelson collaborates with his son again.  I was also surprised that this track wasn't released by a single.  The song is to \\"Around the World in a Day\\" what the title track \\"Purple Rain\\" was to \\"Purple Rain\\" - it serves as the emotional climax to the album.  However this is a very different track than \\"Purple Rain\\".  On this particular track Prince delivers a story of a \\"King\\" and wraps a whole gospel flavor around the song.  The psychedelic element is still in play here.  One of the better Prince tracks.    \\"Temptation\\": The mix of sex and religion in this song may not appeal to many people.  However on this track, Prince moves more toward a Blues Rock sound.   It isn't until you get to the end of this track where you start to hear some of the psychedelic influences on this track.  Still overall I really didn't care for this track.    One thing that is most interesting is the album cover.   There is a cartoon drawing on the album cover and each of the characters on the drawing can be mapped to one of the songs (in fact this was done on the singles that were released).  The liner notes include most of the lyrics to these tracks.  Overall, while Prince doesn't try to recreate Purple Rain, he does succeed in integrating the psychedelic elements into the Minneapolis sound.  While still not as strong an album as \\"Purple Rain\\", this is still a good album and worth checking out.

0719062683|5.0|Peter Barry's BEGINNING THEORY introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory is lucid, engaging, and challenging, and would make an ideal classroom text; but it's also a good one for those individuals like me who have been out of school for some time and are a little curious about how the reading and study of literature has changed over the past few decades. The book's thirteen chapters cover traditional criticism (liberal humanism); structuralism; post-structuralism and deconstruction; postmodernism; psychoanalytic criticism; feminist criticism; lesbian/gay criticism; Marxist criticism; new historicism and cultural materialism; postcolonial criticism; stylistics; narratology; and ecocriticism (the latter being the new kid on the block and usually not included in comparable Theory Introductions). Barry may not be the last word on all these subjects, but I felt he's a good starting point for just about anyone. He advocates reading carefully a few of the most pivotal texts on the subjects covered (rather than reading as broadly as possible); he succinctly summarizes each theory's tenets and practices in easy-to-absorb lists; he encourages readers to apply the theories in some way in \\"Stop and Think\\" exercises; and he provides annotated select reading lists for each chapter. This is a book I expect I'll be returning to time and again as I try to read some of the primary texts Barry recommends.
0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret is about an independent, intelligent young boy who maintains the clocks in a train station. Inheriting the job from his deadbeat uncle, Hugo lives within the walls of the station and must deal with the daily struggle of taking care of himself without any money. While he isn't working he obsesses over an automaton that his father had once worked on. Throughout the novel he strives to make it work again, hoping it will connect him to his dead father. Along the way he makes a new friend and learns that it is okay to depend on others for help.<br /><br />What really makes this book unique are the hundreds of illustrations that are wonderfully drawn by Selznick. They actually take the place of words, they don't just illustrate what you have read. They are not meant to be skimmed over, but analyzed and appreciated.<br /><br />This novel is the type of book you want your kids to read; it is well written, teaches lessons, presents strong characters and has a unique story.
0761145613|5.0|I really can't say much more than other reviewers.  We love this calendar!  I have a family of 4 so we use the last column for \\"Family\\" activities that we all need to participate in.  The artwork is adorable and fun. My kids enjoy reading and writing in their spaces.  We use a binder clip on the edge to keep track of \\"today's date\\".  They take turns moving the clip down daily. I especially like the fact that it starts in September, so we get a new calendar for the new school year.  I Highly recommend this calendar.  It's our second year and I don't know how we ever managed without it!!
0679720200|2.0|This is a strange book about a man that commits a homicide, and what was going on in his head and his circumstances before and after the event.  (Shucks, I've already made it sound interesting . . . it's not).<br /><br />In summary . . . this totally self-absorbed jerk shoots a guy to death, and the jury correctly finds that it is not self-defense, and so finds Msr. Meursault guilty of taking another man's life, unjustifiably, and with intent.  I agree (some other reviewers apparently don't).<br /><br />Mersault is sent to prison awaiting execution.  He doesn't seem to mind very much.  His long term future certainly looks bleak since he has decided that there is no God, and he is scoring near zero on the repentence meter.  Yes, he is an existentialist and a nihilist.<br /><br />So much for the renowned Albert Camus.  Technically, this book is well written.  However, I found it boring, only marginally believable, and generally depressing.  For me, it was no more \\"thought-provoking\\" than observing someone in a cycle of picking and regrowing a scab (inexplicable, but not interesting).  There is NO REASON for the acclaim that this novel has garnered (except perhaps that there are academics out there that wish us to believe that this philosophical tripe is truth).<br /><br />This is an unlikable story about a small unlikable man.  Not recommended, but I understand that your teacher may be forcing you to read it.  Fear not, it is short.  It's a little above average as literature, but written about a fool, by a fool.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Unfortunately, the was Nightwish's last performances with Tarja Turunen - but when you watch this you might see that this was probably one of the best performances with her if not THE best. Despite not having too many early career songs performed they picked a lot of the best stuff from thier more well known era - this concert was a very high note and Tarja will be missed ever so dearly. Video and sound quality wise - it's extremely good! Tarja's live voice is so damn powerful. Get this - 3 disc set - the show on DVD and 2 CDs with the audio - very little difference unlike many CDs which get edited down from the DVD - that's a plus. This is a must have for the Nightwish fans who love Tarja.
0385522401|5.0|I was so disappointed in Saturday that I didn't read this until a friend gave it to me.  Wow, am I glad she did.    I found this to be McEwan's best.  It is short, intense, and clearly demonstrates that sex is more in the brain than in the body.  No need to repeat the story; this is a sad tale of two people who lack the confidence to be honest with themselves and each other -- not an unknown quality in many of us.      I did find it somewhat surprising that the book was set in the 60's; not the 60's I remember even in small town repressed middle America.  However, not everyone is at the same place at the same time. Their families and their upbringing truly made them who they were especially for Florence who apparently had some sort of shameful encounter with her father.  There is probably somebody with the same repressed feelings even today when almost anything seems fair game for public discussion.    I loved this book; it is sad, intense, and provides a narrow peak into the deepest experiences of two people who had the ability to love but didn't have the ability forgive themselves and each other.
B000E8N690|3.0|I'm curious as to why they had an Anglo looking white woman play the part of Johnny Cash's first wife. She is obviously not white (as white goes). She \\"looks\\" black. There's nothing about her that is even remotely passable for white, except for maybe her hair. Do they have a problem with letting the world know that his first wife was a black woman? She was obviously not white. This inaccuracy ruins the film for me because it leads me to believe that the makers of it are racist. The actress who portrayed the part looks nothing like his first wife.
0385341067|5.0|Many have summarized the story which in itself is spellbinding; I knew nothing of the conditions of the Civil War in this part of the world and it was interesting to hear it told from \\"the ground up\\" -- from the eyes of a young woman living through it.      The writing in this book is just beautiful. It was one that when I finished the last page, I immediately went back to the first to begin again.  The character of Matilda is one that I will long remember.  The author has managed to tell a wonderful story in such a readable and memorable manner.  The language is beautiful but not overdone; the sentences are short and filled with impact.  I don't think there is a spare word in the entire book.  There is unspeakable violence in the book, but it is never overdone, and the affect of the violence on the individuals of the island helps explain that seemingly blank look we see too often on TV news clips of violence in third world countries.    Although I was familiar with Great Expectations, I don't believe one would have to be because this is a story about a story and its impact on a young girl. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants a truly thought provoking yet readable and loving book (there is a lot of love in this book).

B000QUCNOK|5.0|This movie is a horror with a fairytale quality due to the random narration, and though there is very little humor in this dark tale, it does have some surface beauty that propels it far above your ordinary horror story.  I love the unique twist on a serial killer obsessed with capturing the 'scent of a woman'.  His first kill is accidental, but once he advances his craft of separating a flower/woman's smell and putting it in a vial, he can't seem to stop until he's captured the scent of every beautiful woman he's ever smelled.  The ending is surreal, and a wicked surprise.  Bravo!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Based on the lead single \\"Dark Road\\" - the best Tori Amos song Tori Amos never wrote - I'd expected this album would be infused with the desolate mood Lennox had drenched her prior album (2003's exceedingly personal Bare) with.  I'd enjoyed Bare, but it's a tough listen, very raw and very dark, exploring the deepest recesses of the depressive side of Lennox's manic-depressive personality.  It was a bit too much for some longtime fans, and the somewhat dated and maudlin production from Stephen Lipson probably didn't help (in all fairness, the album had been written and recorded over the better part of the decade prior to its release).    So imagine how surprised I was when the second track off Songs of Mass Destruction, the uptempo \\"Love Is Blind,\\" came blasting out of my stereo.  Ahhh, Manic Annie, we missed you girl!  Lennox hasn't sounded this manic about her depression since Eurythmics' 1987 album Savage, and her theatricality is a welcome change following the earnestness of Bare.  Sure Bare was moving, but it wasn't exactly an enjoyable exploration of depression, betrayal and self-doubt in the tradition of older Lennox songs like \\"Little Bird\\", \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\" or \\"Would I Lie To You?\\".  Glen \\"Alanis Morissette\\" Ballard's meaty production helps take \\"Love Is Blind\\" exactly where it needs to go, although truth be told his work isn't far from where Lipson left off, and ends up sounding a lot like Dave Stewart's work with Lennox in many spots (it especially recalls Eurythmics' 1999 album Peace, only here the songs themselves are much stronger).  Ultimately, Annie appears to be the primary architect of her sound, a fact which stands in stark contrast to traditional critical assumptions, which cast her as a puppet under the control of Svengali-like producers.  Hardly.    But Ballard does bring with him a far more traditional rock sound than has ever been employed on Lennox's work before.  Nowhere is that more obvious - or effective - than on \\"Smithereens\\", aslow-building ballad which is one of the finest tracks Lennox has written to date.  Stripped of any quirky production gimmickry Stewart or Lipson might have employed, \\"Smithereens\\" takes flight as a straight-ahead, pedal-to-the-metal rock ballad.  Lennox employs many of the dramatic vocal shifts on the song that she's been fond of since 1999's Peace, but her singing here is less (deliberately, one would assume) flat than it was on that release (or on Bare), and her vocals somewhat less strident.  She's also using more of her lower registers - especially in her multitracked harmonies - than she has since Medusa over a decade ago.  The result is the vocal equivalent of a face-lift, with Lennox sounding about a decade younger and hitting her targets in a way she hasn't since 1992's Diva.  It's an absolute joy hearing her sing this way again.    \\"Ghosts In My Machine\\" is another uptempo track which recalls Eurythmics' middle period and albums like Be Yourself Tonight and Revenge.  Even the production is a little quirky, combining accordions with a grinding electronic bass.  Her voice is somewhat more ragged and strident here in the verses, but it works with the material and she continues to make good use of her upper and lower registers.  She certainly sounds like she broke a sweat recording this one, which is something you can't say about most if not all of her past few releases.  And the energy persists on the next track, \\"Womankind\\", which in spite of its title is less of a feminist anthem and more about the desire for a partner - Lennox making the personal political.  It's catchy, and features a cacophony of vocal tics that could only come from Annie Lennox, in addition to an effective little guest rap.    Next come two moody ballads, \\"Through A Glass Darkly\\" and \\"Lost\\".  \\"Darkly\\" is an almost eerie work, heavily electronic compared to its surroundings, and wouldn't have sounded out of place on Peace (where it would have been a highlight).  \\"Lost\\" is equally eerie,and may be the most political track on the album with its references to planes in the night and marching drums.  Lennox tests the limits of the upper reaches of her voice in a song that's reminiscent of multilayered vocal tracks off of Bare like \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things\\".    \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" follows, and it's a blast straight outta 1984, like an unreleased B-side to \\"Here Comes The Rain Again\\" or Annie Lennox as produced by the Pet Shop Boys.  You apparently don't need Dave Stewart to make a Eurythmics record!  It's interesting to hear her sing in a way she hasn't really utilized much in the past decade or so, a sort of Teutonic soul goddess.  When the song hits its bridge Lennox delivers a vocal freakout straight out of \\"I Could Give You (A Mirror)\\" off of Sweet Dreams and every hair on the back of my neck stands on end.  Who says you can't go home again?  \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" probably should have been the last track on the album, as it might be as much a prologue as a flashback, with Lennox expressing a desire to release a dance record in recent interviews.    \\"Sing\\" follows, with its much-hyped chorus featuring just about every female singer in the western world, none individually identifiable (\\"We Are The World\\" this ain't).  Advance word was that this track is a disaster, but I absolutely love it.  Lyrically it's reminiscent of anthemic early Eurythmics tracks (like \\"Sweet Dreams\\") - musically it's more like mid-period Eurythmics - but the result is extremely catchy.   Madonna gets a whole verse to herself, but she should have declined the offer to participate.  You can't help but compare her voice side by side to Annie's, and it's like comparing a wrecked, rusted Yugo to a Porsche 911.  Poor Madge.  Her delivery is so monotone it's clear she isn't even trying, but kudos to her for participating (her monotone delivery actually works well for her verse) and to Annie for assembling a track that at least tries to bring attention to a specific issue (mother to child HIV transmission in South Africa) that could theoretically be resolved.    \\"Big Sky\\" and \\"Fingernail Moon\\" finish up the album.  The former is a dramatic, vaguely hip-hop influenced ballad - the tinkly toy piano sample is very old school - while the latter is a somewhat rambling downtempo album closer that would have been at home on Bare, although it's a bit more theatrical than most of that record.  \\"Big Sky\\" is the more successful of the two, an intrinsically better song with a more engaging performance - it's a pity Nina Simone isn't around anymore to cover it, as it seems almost tailor made for her voice and her delivery.    Lyrically this album isn't Lennox's strongest work, although there does seem to be some attempt to draw parallels between personal and political relationships (hence the album's deliciously cheeky title).  My only real complaint with Songs of Mass Destruction is that the audio has had the dynamic range compressed right out of it, with many of the tracks sounding distorted as a result.  The record has virtually no dynamic range, especially the uptempo numbers.  This is a common complaint on albums released over the past 5 years or so though, and I blame the record companies for this, not the artists who presumably have little say in the matter.      Her contract's up with this record, so I'm guessing she goes for Prince-like one-record distribution deals with labels going forward.  As Lennox has more money than God she can afford all the studio time, producers and musicians in the world, although since she owns her own studio and plays many of her own instruments she doesn't really have much need of either.  Whether it's a dance record or an acoustic folk number it should be interesting to see exactly what Lennox wraps her exquisite pipes around next.  Marianne Faithful once said of Lennox that there was no one like her before, and there's been no one like her since.  Songs Of Mass Destruction makes this abundantly clear, and it'sheartening to see that Lennox still has an ample supply of creativity and plenty of energy left to utilize it.
B00003CXA2|2.0|Higly overated, this sentimental flick is part Zelig, part Being There--minus the irony, honesty, or wit of either.  While it had some fine acting, a decent (though wierdly predictable) soundtrack, and even a few memorable moments, the praise that was heaped on Gump was so undeserved, I thought, that finally watching this \\"great movie\\" in the theater and having to sit through the standing ovation at the end was a little nauseating--literally.
B00005JPRF|5.0|Being the third of the movie series so far, I wasn't sure how good this movie would be, especially since the setting has changed so much. In 1 and 2, the setting was mostly dark and spooky. This one is set in the bright desert, quite a change. I loved the first two Resident Evil films, so i knew I had to see this one, hoping for the best... I got it. This movie is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone that like some blood and gore, and of course, zombies. Go see this movie.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Rihanna is by far one of the most mature artists out there, considering she is just 19. I just saw her perform at my university in NY and wow, she did an awesom job. She can really sing in the studio as well as on stage, equally well. This album is a big step forward for Rihanna in terms of maturity and better music. This album outdoes every album before this and is great to listen to over and over. The best songs in my opinion are Umbrella, Shut Up & Drive, Breakin' Dishes, Don't Stop The Music, Hate That I Love You and Rehab. Rehab is definitely one of the most melodic songs with great lyrics. Check out this album for sure, you will not be disappointed if you want some great fresh music.

From the day it came out back in 98, and almost 10 years later, I still listen to the CD and get blown away the same way I did back then.  Without a doubt, this is my favorite and probably will always be my favorite PJ Harvey album.  She created something that to me is totally flawless.  I have all her albums from the first, Dry to her newest, White Chalk, and this one is the one I always go back to, and I do love her other CD's, but this one is tops for me.  I won't go into detail about the songs individually, but I love them all.  I love the textures of this CD, I love the electronic, the organic, the lyrics, her voice.  I can't say enough about this album.  Lastly, if you love this album, you need to check out the B-Sides.  The B-Sides that came about from this session are absolutely amazing as well.  Sweeter Than Anything is one of the BSides from A Perfect Day Elise CD single.  If you are a fan of this album you need to check out that song.  AMAZING.
0142000663|5.0|I loved this book, period.  I was \\"forced\\" to read it in high school, and we all know how much teenagers appreciate great American literature. (wink wink.)<br />I am so glad I decided to pick it up and read it again, because it was as if I'd never laid eyes on the book before.  This book is beautifully written, powerful, and heartbreaking.  I did not fully realize the plight of the migrant workers in the 1920's and this book made me grow to respect and empathize with the Joad family and others like them.<br />This book stayed with me for a while after I read it; I kept thinking about it and analyzing it.  I couldn't wait for my husband to finish reading it so we could talk about it.  If anyone is intimidated by the phrase \\"classic novel\\" or has bad memories of being forced to read classics in high school, I strongly urge you to read this book--I read everything from People magazine to Patricia Cornwell to chick lit--and I LOVED this book.
B000UR366S|2.0|Joni is entitled to a very personal album like this - she can put out whatever she wants and I will still like it.   This one taunts the listener to check out her strong opinions, including the artwork.  The music is good, relaxed mostly, a little forced at times.  The lyrics make me wonder as if Al Gore or Jane Fonda were involved. Unless Joni was talking about Kairo, Teheran or Damascus - where trees certainly are not in abundance.   One has to assume though, she does refer to her place of residence, Malibu, the US, Canada.  There are nothing but healthy trees in these places and yes - some small malls and parking lots - in comparison.  I never wanted Joni to turn into a Joan Baez type and she's moving into this direction with her lyrics.  Her music is much better though.

B000W8OM5Y|5.0|Reasons not to do so:  The new extras: a couple of History Channel featturetes and some archival interviews. That's it ??? This is the best they could come up for a movie this good ??? This reminds me of another Paramount re-release (Mission Impossible): one waits years for an improved edition  and all they do is sprinkle it with a few, mediocre extras.  Reasons to do so:  Easily one of my very favorite films.  Deciding factor: the video and audio on the first edition left a lot to be desired. If the new one does clearly improve on them (I'll be sure to check the reviews) I may, just may consider it.  UPDATE 1-16-08  Having gone ahead and purchased this re-issue I must say I'm very happy with it, both the video and audio have been greatly improved and the extras, even though not in the same league as say, the GLADIATOR or TITANIC 3 disc editions, are, at least, above average. Too bad for the really lousy packaging, I bet Paramount would have sold a lot more copies if they'd applied themselves a little bit on this DVDs presentation.  Shame on Paramount for not doing things right the first time around but if you love BRAVEHEART like I do, I suggest you swalow your pride, keep the insert from the previous edition and enjoy this new, great DVD.
B000EGDB10|5.0|Like \\"The Untouchables\\" (another film from a classic tv show that DePalma made for Paramount), producers Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner hired Brian DePalma to direct this espionage/action/summer popcorn fest for Paramount, and once he did, it became a 'Brian DePalma film', filled with lots of psychological profiles, deceptive characters, and a whole host of other mind blowing craftmanship that only he can deliver. Working from a script by Robert Townshend (\\"Chinatown\\") and David Koep (who worked with DePalma on \\"Carlito's Way\\" and \\"Snake Eyes\\"), DePalma delivered a tour-de-force of psychological/action/espionage that is just as mind blowing today as it was when it was released to great acclaim 11 years ago. Yes, still a classic, if not more so, after all these years! His trademark touches are throughout the entire film, swirling camera work, altered camera angles, slpit screen, split dioptor, et al. I haven't seen a film in this genre of such magnitutde since Hitchcock's \\"Topaz\\"! And, even though Cruise was a producer of the film, he and DePalma butted heads over budget (Cruise was concerned about going over, and DePalma said \\"F**k it, who cares!\\"), and it's obvious Paramount knew who to listen to about that matter (plus, we ALL know what an egotistical/arrogant/ignorant a**hole Cruise is anyways), letting DePalma make the film HIS and not Cruise's.<br />My mission here, dare I accept it, is to explain the very simple plot of this film (way TOO many people have declared and/or criticized the plot being too convuloted) because a LOT of people (for God knows what reason) just didn't understand it. No offense!<br />The film opens with a typical DePalma 'bait and switch' scene (where you see one thing, but it turns out to be something entirely different than what you expected it to be), where we are introduced to the first team of spy agents, led by Ethan Hunt (who we all know by now was played by Tom Cruise). They return to base headquarters, and their boss Mr. Phelps (Jon Voight in a superb performance) returns from vacation and sends them on a new mission on a mole hunt to recover a stolen NOC list, a list of spies' names that matches another disc with their code names, and this list of names CANNOT get out in the open. Emilio Estevez turns in a wonderful uncredited performance as Jack, one of the team members (he did it just for the opportunity to work with DePalma) who is first to meet with a sinister fate when this mission goes horribly/horrorfyingly wrong. The rest of the team is killed, Mr. Phelps is shot, so Ethan is the lone survivor, making him the lead suspect as the mole. He is then disavowed as an agent.<br />Enter Kittridge (Henry Czerny), the head of the whole operation, who is now on the trail of Ethan with (almost) a vengeance, so Ethan goes into hiding. That's when Ethan discovers the trail of 'JOB' and Max, and proceeds by internet to meet with Max (the awesome Vanessa Redgrave in one of her best roles ever). Claire (Emmanuelle Beart), one of the previous team members, and Mr. Phelps' wife (and thought dead) finds Ethan and lets him know that she is alive after all, leading Ethan to be suspicious of her, even as they rebuild a new team of spies (Jean Reno and Ving Rhames, who worked with DePalma in \\"Casualties Of War\\") from a list of other disavowed agents.<br />Then, out of the blue Mr. Phelps returns in a pivotal scene that DePalma plays for all it's worth, with Jim (Phelps) telling Ethan his version of the failed mission, him getting shot, and how he survived, all the while Ethan is having flashbacks of how it REALLY happened (very reminiscent of Hitchcock's classics \\"Stagefright\\" which opened with a 'false flashback', and \\"I Confess\\", which featured pivotal flashbacks that revealed more than what was being told), letting the viewer in on who REALLY set up Ethan's team for the assasination.<br />Ethan and team break into Langley in one of the most memorable exhilerating/breathtaking scenes in cinema history tosteal the real NOC list so it can be delivered to Max in return for Job. This leads to one of the most awesome set pieces in espionage/action movie history, setting the most climatic scene of all (the film is full of them!) on a train moving at high speed. Ethan saves the NOC list from getting into the open, exposes Job for who he really is, and he and his team are re-avowed back into the spy business. See, simple plot!<br />DePalma employs a very old technique: Tell a simple story in a very complicated way, something that Hitchcock, Kubrick, Antonioni, Bergman, Fellini, Lynch, and any other great director does to make a great film. And, this is a GREAT film! Forget the sequels (if they could be called such) even exist, for this is the ONLY 'Mission' that exists other than the tv show it is based on. Oh yeah, a final twist:<br />\\"How about a cinema of Aruba, Mr. Hunt???\\".<br />Thank you!list so it can be delivered to Max in return for Job.

B000002OR4|5.0|I Think this is John Williams Masterpiece. It brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.
0441009425|4.0|A friend recommended this to me as Reynolds is his favorite author. I was instantly hooked and the book held my attention well the whole way through. It was very creative and has a rich dialoge describing gadgets and weapons, branches of humanity, and a few alien cultures. Very intricate plot kept me guessing till the end. However, I was a bit shell shocked at the very end and caught myself saying \\"RRRRIIGHHT...\\". Kind of funny to start questioning a scifi novel on unrealistic course of events! But even with that minor annoyance of an ending a bit too perfect (one assumes because it is vaguely described at best), the book is extremely well thought out. I will go on to read some of his others.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|\\"Machinist\\" totally gobsmacked me. I've always been impressed with Christian Bale's acting abilities, but this time, he almost went too far.  There's a quote in the movie, \\"If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist.\\"  That really fits Bale's appearance.  He's at 120 in this film and only stopped there because the directors were afraid for his health.     Bale plays Trevor Reznik, a machinist who has not slept for a year.  He's seeing people at machines near him who don't work at his job, someone's breaking in to his apartment and leaving cryptic notes, everywhere he's seeing connections--but to what?  Is it illusions caused from him not sleeping?  Is it some kind of plot?      The end shocked me--but it truly explained a lot.  \\"Machinist\\" is one of the best-acted films I have seen in a long time--and the conclusion really did sneak up on me.  Very impressed--but I'm classifying this film as a rental for me--I doubt I could see it more than once.

B00005JPRD|5.0|Once in awhile, if you're lucky, you see a film that resonates within you. It touches your soul with its visual poetry, leaving you spellbound and mesmerized for hours after the credits roll. For me, that film is \\"Across The Universe.\\"<br /><br />It seemed destined to disappoint me, because from the moment I first heard about it, I've been in high anticipation mode. Every news clip, every trailer, every commercial heightened my excitement. Surely no movie could possibly live up to such expectations. So to be honest, I wouldn't have been surprised if I'd hated it. I didn't.<br /><br />It began with a beautiful boy on a beautiful beach singing a beautiful Beatles song. And the first threads of the web were cast. For the next two hours I sat utterly enthralled as a cinematic masterpiece of unexpected brilliance unfolded before me. At times I leaned forward in my seat, enchanted by the sweetness. At times I fell back, blown away by the perfect coalescence of subject, music, cinematography and editing. Over and over, I was impressed with the unique contexts in which those so-very-familiar songs were placed (the bouncy \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" becomes a torchy lesbian love ballad, scary Uncle Sams growling \\"I Want You\\" reach out of recruitment posters to terrify near-naked draftees). More than mere eye/ear candy, \\"Across The Universe\\" is a feast for the soul.<br /><br />A few caveats: I *lived* these times. I appreciated small touches in the film that viewers who weren't up-close-and-personal with the era won't even notice. I related to the characters in a way younger moviegoers can't. Plus, I've been a diehard Beatles fan since 1964 -- I know every note and every word of every Beatles song ever released (and some that weren't). Let me tell you, this movie is *permeated* with Beatlemania. It isn't just the songs and the characters' names. There are inside jokes here, there and everywhere. And yes, the basic plot is predictable and the main characters stereotypical. The \\"star-crossed lovers, love conquers all\\" storyline is as old as mankind, but I seriously doubt many people will be going to see \\"Across The Universe\\" expecting a riveting plot.<br /><br />Still, as in everything, taste is subjective. One of our group (who hates musicals) walked out after about 30 minutes, and actually demanded a refund of her ticket price. I walked out on a cloud, on which I'm still floating. \\"Across The Universe\\" didn't just speak to me, it *sang* to me. And I have to sing back.conquers all\\" storyline is as old as mankind, but I seriously doubt many people will be going to see \\"Across The Universe\\" expecting a riveting plot.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|So many others have written detailed reviews; mine is not. I just want to say I love this series. It's original and well-acted. Hall does an amazing job of playing an emotionless character who manages to create emotion in the audience (I totally have a TV crush on Dexter!), and the script is so creative. I can't wait to read the books! The series does have some violence, but it's not very explicit. Mostly we see dead bodies, not the actual killing, and nothing very gorey...I actually found Nip/Tuck to be much harder to watch in terms of blood and gore! But if you've a soft stomach, don't get it.
B00005JPMZ|3.0|The brothers have grown apart.  Leonardo is in the jungle, perfecting his ninja art.  Donatello is working tech support.  Michaelangelo is playing the party circuit as a turtle clown.  Rafael prowls the streets of New York City as a vigilante, trying to mete out justice in a very unjust time.     They all come back together when the world is at threat.  The legend has it an ancient warrior with aspirations of world domination finds a portal to another dimension and unleashes monsters on the world.  He's given immortal life, but his generals are cast in stone.     3000 years later, the time is right for the portal to open again.  This time, the warrior is assembling the monsters--but for what purpose?  If they're re-animated, the world won't stand.    The brothers have to get back together and work as a team to vanquish this threat.  Unfortunately, in many ways, their time apart has only divided them.  There's jealousy and misunderstanding among them--and until they can work that out, they can't work together.    The film has a great message for all of us about learning to act on teams to get a common goal accomplished.  Also, how to accept our differences and use them to our mutual advantage.  TMNT could be used for teens as well as adult corporate situations.
0887431453|5.0|I purchased this book on a whim. I was looking for a book that had a little bit of everything so my son could practice writing, circling etc. This book is so much fun. The sections are:  Same or Different, Mazes, Does it belong?, Uppercase Alphabet, Lowercase alphabet, Thinking Skills, Preschool Basics, Preschool Scholar etc.  It has many activites all of which my son love. He loves the Mazes section, matching and finding differences.  He also like the thinking section which has activites where you look for things that don't belong in the picture.  It's really an excellent book with 320 pages full of cute bright cartoon animals, toys and children.  I can never flip the pages infront of my son when going to a specific page because he'll want to stop and work on something different.  It really helps children learn on so many levels. My son is getting better at holding his pencil, learning to follow the directions. Here are just a few examples :  - Circle pictures that are the same  - Circle  the pictures that are differen  - Draw a line from this object to the matching one    - Circle two pictures that make a pair  At first I thought it was a little too expensive but after seeing the way my son loves this book it's worth every penny. There was a day he worked on it for close to 2 hours. I am purchasing individual books from this company too. A must buy.
B00009W0U4|5.0|While this film is notorious for its horrific scenes of rape and revenge, I think that many people are missing the point of this movie.  Yes, these scenes are hard to watch and extremely graphic, but the later/earlier scenes are just as honest and intimate.  Each scene is a world unto its own, full of little embarrassments, honest love, and (unfortunately) brutal violence.  I think the filmmaker is forcing the audience to look at each moment in our own lives and realize that we do not know what will happen next.  Each moment with a loved one could be our very last.  Each party we attend could be the last time we see the love of our lives.  Every decision we make, no matter how full of  rage/love/indifference we are at the time, can never be unmade.  They are, like the title, irreversible.  Rarely does a film of any genre stick in my mind for as long as this one did, and not just because of how angry and upset I was about poor Monica Belucci's fate, but also because of the sweet love scenes between her and the men who are also destroyed by revenge.  Love it or loathe it, this movie is not exploitative drivel, it is art of the highest form: the kind that makes you think.
B000AMJC2K|3.0|I got my Neo-Flex LCD arm in October 2007.  I'm using it with a 20\\" widescreen Samsung monitor (model 206bw) and an Ikea Galant desk.    It took a lot of tweaking an experimenting for me to get it set up satisfactorily. I found it's important to have a very stable desk to avoid having the monitor shake while you're using your computer (such as when gaming).  To be fair, this is probably true of all monitor arms.  I had to remove the middle portion of the arm* and replace the legs on my desk**, but now it's rock solid.    The arm supports the weight of my monitor well, but I think a 20\\" widescreen is about as large as you can go with it.  I had to tighten most of the adjustments to close to the maximum, and it takes some force to move it.    The articulation is a little different than you'd expect.  If the elevation is above 90\\", tilting the monitor from side to side causes it to rotate a bit, so you have to rotate it again to level it in the new position.  This could have been avoided if they had arranged the joints directly behind the monitor differently.    Overall, I think this is a sturdy, well-built, and useful product.  I like having the space under and behind my monitor freed up so I can do something useful with it.  Though I would probably consider the Ergotron LX for larger monitors like mine, if I had to buy it again.    Notes:  * this piece is optional and its removal is described in the manual (but watch out for the ends, they're coated in grease).  ** I replaced the Ikea Galant T-style legs with the A-style legs, which are cheaper and seem to be more stable.
1416523359|3.0|I bought this book on a whim because I needed something to read.  I wish I hadn't.      Lisey's Story is all about The Widow Landon as she sorts through her husband's crap after his death.   I can't really remember what causes her to start her journey to Boo'Ya Moon, her husband's other world.     What really annoyed me was her and Scott's inner language, such as \\"bool\\" \\"Smucking\\" \\"puffickly hoo-yuge\\" etc...    That's always annoyed me about King's work; the way he inserts weird little sayings like that into his work.    Other than that, It was alright.

B000EQHHJW|4.0|This is a wonderful \\"Rigoletto\\".  It is full of drama.  The signing from the three principals beyond reproach.  The orchestral playing is dramatic and smooth as silk, although the balance favors the singers excessively.  Some film scenes are breathtaking in their beauty.    I had always thought that opera created specifically for video would have many advantages over staged productions.  However the reverse seems   generally true to me.  I suppose it is because operas are indeed great works of the theater, and they need the ethos of the theater, including the audience interaction to shine.  Or is that the producers lack a certain artistic sensitivity and imagination?  Having said that, this is the most successful production of opera out of the theater that I have seen on video.      It seems to me that the music dramas of Richard Wagner are most ripe for imaginative productions for video out of the theater.    A word about the sound.  The DTS 5.1 sound track is of very inferior quality.  It is top heavy with a screeching string tone, the brass is all lip and no bell, the singers are all head and no chest voice.  The bass quality is poor and largely absent.  Happily the PCM 2 channel stereo tracks are much better.  The bass is full, the only problem being a balance of the signers over the orchestra that is less than optimal.    A word about sound tracks on DVD opera.  Both Dolby digital and DTS 5.1 use lossy digital compression.  For large scale musical works such as opera, any lossy compression is going to produce inferior results and unpleasant digital artifacts, which on this recording are horrendous.    The 2 channel PCM tracks are lossless digital feeds of true CD quality.  Fortunately most operas on DVD have these tracks.  The multichannel Dolby and DTS tracks are contrived from two channel stereo in any event on most opera DVD productions.  Therefore for viewers who have home theater multichannel systems they are much better off having their audio visual preamps or receivers, produce the ambient surround effect in Dolby PLx Music for five channel systems, or Dolby PLIIx Music for seven channel systems.  I do not recommend the Cinema, or settings other than Music, for opera.  The seven channel PLIIx is significantly more effective than the  five channel PLx, at conveying a realistic sense of space and ambiance.    The way the system is set up is to connect the DVD player to the audio visual preamp or receiver using the digital interface using a digital cable, which on most players is optical.  On some it may be coaxial SPDIF.  Select 2 channel PCM on the DVD audio menu.  Set the input of the   preamp or receiver to the the appropriate digital connection, and select the appropriate version of Dolby PLx or PLIIx for your system.    Unless your system is superb, and has very good speakers for ALL channels you will be better off listening in standard stereo.  The center speakers in particular, tend to be poor in most set ups, with very few stellar performers to choose from.  All the surround speakers need to be high quality full range speakers, of a quality comparable to the fronts.  All speakers need to be carefully balanced.  If these caveats do not pertain to your multichannel system you will almost certainly get the best results listening in stereo.    A well set up surround system, can however bring a real sense of \\"being there\\", that can not be matched by even the best two channel systems.
1400032717|4.0|\\"It was 7 minutes after midnight.\\" Every detail matters in the solution of the mystery of the neighbor's murdered dog, which is The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. That's partly because the detective on the case is Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old boy with autism, a penchant for numbers, a genius for math, and a determination to solve the mystery and write a book.<br /><br />Clues abound, but Christopher's strictly literal view of the world prevents him from seeing or understanding them, even as he records them. In his mind, metaphors are \\"lies,\\" and phrases like \\"raining cats and dogs\\" and \\"you'll catch your death from cold\\" are incomprehensible nonsense. As the story behind Wellington's death unfolds, Haddon masterfully gives the reader the clues that escape Christopher while allowing him to pursue the more logical details he does understand and to get help with the more subtle ones.<br /><br />Along the way, Christopher offers insight into the autistic mind and people's reaction to it. While he cannot read emotions or pick up on verbal cues and body language (unless they are explained to him; for example, he knows that a raised voice may indicate anger), his mind processes details the average person would miss. While we might see cows and some flowers in a field, he knows how many cows, he can draw each of their individual patterns, and he can name the species of flowers.<br /><br />Just as Christopher doesn't understand why everyone won't or can't notice these important details, the people he encounters, while quickly picking up that he is different, can't figure out how and adjust themselves. His working-class father tries to, but his understanding of his son seems limited to an intellectual rather than an emotional one. He knows that Christopher hates to be touched and is wise enough to develop a hand signal that signifies love in lieu of a hug, but he doesn't understand at an emotional level the pain that touch causes his son. Not surprisingly, he can become frustrated when Christopher can't behave in the normal way. If Christopher's perception is limited by autism, his father's is limited to what he knows and can see. He cannot feel what it's like to be Christopher any more than Christopher can figure out that his father's quiet, slow speech indicated tightly controlled anger.<br /><br />As Christopher works on the mystery and his book, he learns how to do things he may not have thought possible; for example, he survives the ordeal of going to a crowded train station and traveling alone. More significantly, he learns how to twist and withhold the truth when necessary. When his father makes him promise not to do something, Christopher rationally determines what he can and cannot do within the very literal sense of the promise, thereby breaking it in spirit. As he pursues his investigation, he seems to grasp that he is on questionable ground according to his own standards, even as he senses that the mystery is important enough to justify his rationalizations. By the end, he can say with pride and with some truth, \\"I can do anything.\\"<br /><br />Haddon uses a simple technique to convey the linear, mathematical nature of Christopher's mind and thought process; as the story builds, Christopher begins many if not most of his sentences with \\"and.\\" \\"And I bent down . . . And I walked after him . . . And someone said . . . And I said . . . And the man . . . And then I heard . . .\\" The use of \\"and\\" not only sounds genuine, but it is also additive--that is, mathematical. For someone who squares numbers in his head to stay calm, \\"and\\" is one way to manage the sensory and emotional overload he encounters in his quest to determine the killer.<br /><br />Only someone who is autistic can say whether Haddon has captured the thought process and emotions accurately. Even if The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is not a complete insight into the autistic mind, it is a valuable one, and a reminder that not everyone sees the world we see in exactly the same way we do.<br /><br />©Diane L.

B0000AUHQT|5.0|I loved this film. It just seemed perfect in every way... the cinematography and integration of visuals, musical score (DVD--Nelson Riddle), narration, sets, costuming, casting. And it was tremendously moving and brought out the sociological themes as well as the theme of Gatsby's hopelessly romantic nature. Fitzgerald just hated that rich guys could buy the most desirable (though empty) girls. I commented to a friend that I was surprised that an American director could make such a powerful, intelligent film. Then I found out the director was British. That explains it!

I can not understand all of the hype that Oprah gave this book.  Usually the books she recommends are a lot better than this.  By the time I read half way through her trip in India, I could not stand another minute of her egotistical chatter.  Do yourself a favor, skip this book all together.
1569242739|5.0|The book sold me on the photos alone, but the recipes do not disappoint.  Never has vegan baking been so invisibly delicious, so perfectly dressed up as the richest, most indulgent lacto-ovo baking, totally indetectable to those not in the know.  I've made the vanilla (vegan cream cheese frosting), chocolate (peanut buttercream), pineapple (pineapple topping), tiramisu (holy crap), pistachio rosewater (with rosewater buttercream), and dulce sin leche cupcakes (with a squirt of my own coconut caramel in the middle, lemony buttercream, toasted coconut, and caramel doodads on top).  Every single cupcake has been moaning-aloud-in-obscene-pleasure delicious.  The rise is perfect, the crumb is tender and soft without a trace of the gumminess associated with vegan baking, and the frostings are pure sin (or heaven, whatever).  I've had to hide this book from myself to stay focused on school and stop making cupcakes already.

B00069FLC2|5.0|It is excellent to listen and view 'The Shadows' play again. I fully enjoyed their music and had watch it a dozen times since I bought the DVD 2 months ago. I have recalled more than a dozen numbers that I had listened during the 60's during my school days. To date, I have purchased another 6 copies of this DVD as presents for my friends who envy great music.  I realise from 'The Final Tour', the majority of the audience are younger fans who fancy the music of the yester years. Highly recommended. Will vote a 6 star if there is.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|The original Nuggets album was released in 1972, and was a compilation album of rock and pop songs from the mid to late '60s by groups that weren't popular enough to merit their own \\"greatest hits\\" album.  The album actually proved to be very influential, drawing attention to forgotten and never known groups from the era.  This four disc box set features the original album in it's entirety as Disc One, plus three other discs of similar material.  Many of the songs here were hits \\"back in the day\\", usually by groups that never had another hit.  There are also a number of obscure songs that were not hits at all.  Most of the songs are presented in the original mono single version, although a few of them are in stereo.  Most of the songs here are are great, and the few that aren't great are interesting curios.  This is an essential purchase for fans of '60s rock music.

It sits comfortably next to some of the best anime ever to come to the States.<br /><br />Tekkon Kinkreet follows two young boys, known around the city as the Cats, but to each other they are Black and White. Black is a brooding, violent youngster with a gift for taking pain and dishing it out. White is, simply, special; he's empathic, enjoys life, and has a deep sense of when things aren't right. He also seems to be magically gifted. That gift, however, has left White an innocent boy, incapable of growing up and acting his age; that's why Black feels obligated to protect the young boy, and the that means eliminating any possible threat to him and White, as well as the city in which they live. Thus, these two have a few enemies, including the Yakuza, some strange and powerful alien assassins, and a mysterious creature known by the youth in the city as the \\"Minotaur.\\" All the while, the two are continually robbing and mugging those within their city so that they can achieve White's dream of living in a house on a beach....<br /><br />Yeah, interesting, I know. But what makes the story of Tekkon Kinkreet that much better is the surreality of the whole thing. It doesn't try to explain much; it doesn't have to. White and Black can run at tremendous speeds and leap ten feet into the air; aliens exist; and a boy has the power to link himself mentally to his best friend. Why? Because they do.... And all the while, it's as fantastically believable as a well told fantasy novel.<br /><br />Outside of that, the art and characters of Tekkon Kinkreet helps to drive the story along. The settings contains so much detail that it's impossible to find anything. If this was a \\"Where's Waldo\\" drawing, you'd never find him. The character art is also beautiful, reminiscent of the short sequence in [[ASIN:B00005JMEW Kill Bill, Volume 1]].<br /><br />Now, for the one drawback (which many older anime fans wouldn't even consider as a drawback): this will be a very difficult anime for a new-comer to get into. The story isn't difficult to follow, but it can be confusing and the ending leaves a lot unanswered, as is the wont of anime. Still, though, if you have some experience with anime, then you won't be disappointed. The art is beautiful, the story is engaging, and the characters are endearing. I'd rate it higher if it were possible. Tekkon Kinkreet is definitely one of the best anime ever.impossible to find anything. If this was a \\"Where's Waldo\\" drawing, you'd never find him.

B000EGEVZK|5.0|What you get here is a very generous collection of footage, the great majority high-quality, multi-camera shot with good sound. The few rough clips are fully watchable and are excellent inclusions: a 3-song clip of the Ramones in 1974, two years before their debut album, playing a very raw, stripped down rock for the time. Next rough clip is two years later, the earliest footage with the band's pro act down, and worth seeing for Joey's Fonzie T-shirt. The rest of DVD 1 is 90+ minutes of great footage from the Ramones' early peak era, 1976-77. Despite one reviewer's complaint, the 12/31/77 It's Alive footage is great -- any minor discrepancies are attributable to the kind of film editing you see in almost any product. DVD 2 has more great footage, though the band's live performance diminshes sharply from 1985 on, with Joey obviously bored with the repertoire, crooning through the classics and letting hired bassist C-Jay (post 1988) handle lots of the chorus vocals. There is one great amateur clip from this era though, with a sign-language interpreter (!) translating Joey's introduction and playing some air guitar.    By the way, the extras on this set, not mentioned on the outer packaging, are superb. Great cheesy early-1980s videos of two \\"Pleasant Dreams\\" tracks, and the band in a skit from the Sha Na Na show that will remind you of their great deadpan delivery in the Rock and Roll High School film.

It the my \\"go to\\" book that I typically do read at least once a year during an unexpected wait in an ER etc. I purchased this audio book because I drive in my work and I wanted to see if I liked it compared to the last one I tried several years ago where the narrator was so southern I could not understand her. All I can say about Sissy Spacek is that she hits this one out of the park. I was captivated from beginning to end. I give this audio book a A +++.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Most of the blu-ray movies I want are not yet out. I'm glad this classic is finally available. It is stunning in the blu-ray format (we have a PS3, 1080i tv, and HDMI hookup), very high quality, both video and sound meet expectations. The extras are also well worth the $18 we paid for it at Wal-mart.

This groups got \\"it,\\" whatever \\"it\\" is they've got it.  I love the voice of Adam Levine, it is so unique.  This cd reminds of the being in the 80's dance clubs getting my groove on.  Loved this CD.

B000SNUMC0|5.0|With all the current metal bands busy gargling razor blades and chugging along grunting lyrics I cannot understand, a new release by Iced Earth is a welcome addition to the metal catalogue.    Some may dismiss this as a re-tread of 80's metal glory, but the intelligent song-writing and storyline remind me, at one point metal bands actually wrote songs that told a story, or had some meaning.  Far too often bands roll on angst, anger, and shock value, it is great to have you back Iced Earth.    Now bring the show to the states so we can appreciate this master-stroke live!

B000U618C8|5.0|Elegant guitar work and gentle vocals are at the core of this record. José's second album is much like the first both in musical approach and quality. I think Jose's music is refreshing in amongst today's cheap pop. This music has a softness, harmony and rhythm which combine beautifully. Its indie folk put on ice and left to chill. English is José's second language which probably lends its self to the simply but articulate lyrics. Highlights are the \\"Massive Attack\\" cover Teardrop, Killing For Love and In Our Nature but these are only highlights among what is a complete collection of songs. If you are familiar with his first album \\"Veneer\\" this is on par. Buy this album, put it on, kick off your shoes get comfortable and mellow out man.
1594489505|4.0|After The Kite Runner, I looked forward to Hosseini's next book. From a literary standpoint, A Thousand Splendid Suns certainly did not disappoint. He weaved personal stories into the social and historic framework of Afghanistan, and the result was wonderful. This is a very sad book, though. Also, while the character of Mariam was strong and endearing, I couldn't feel quite as strongly about Laila.
0385733577|5.0|I read this book way too fast. I wanted the story to never end and now I am beside myself with anticipation as to what happens next. I cant wait for the next book.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|Perhaps I was a little too harsh when I gave Linkin Park's last proper album Meteora a two-and-a-half star rating; I did that because most of the songs didn't stand out to me, at least back then. In fact, I was surprised when they released \\"Numb\\" and \\"Breaking the Habit\\" because I forgot those songs were even on there. Anyway, I can tell right away that their latest album Minutes to Midnight is great.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers seem to dislike this album for two reasons: 1) there are too many slower songs on here, and 2) Mike doesn't rap very much on here. For the former, I think reviewer M. Smith said it best when s/he suggested that core fans of the band need to stop living in the past; I mean, it would be different if the entire album was ballad-y. And it's not like Chester's vocals sound any different. For the latter, I kinda wanted to hear Mike rapping a little more too, but then I remembered that that's not that important because he's also the rhythm guitarist/keyboardist, so he decided to focus more on THOSE things. If he were a hype man ONLY, it would be a different story.<br /><br />Anyway, lead single \\"What I've Done\\" is easily the best song. Also good are \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" as well as the romantic three-in-a-row: \\"Valentine's Day\\", \\"In Between\\" and \\"In Pieces\\". And \\"Bleed It Out\\" is a highlight as well (especially that Saturday Night Live performance), but the only thing about it is, well, it's the second single off the album, and it sounds a little too much like the second single from their LAST album, \\"Faint\\" (but on the positive side, Mike's rap is a little better on this song than on the former).<br /><br />If there are any songs that I can do without, they would be \\"Give It Up\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\", because they sound too wannabe metal. But despite what LP diehards want you to think, Minutes to Midnight is a quality album worth buying.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000MV8ABS|5.0|My poor Phantasm.  It never seems to be in with the likes<br />of Friday the 13th or HELLRAISER and NIGHTMARE ON ELM ST.<br />That's a shame for I put it right there with Hell and Night<br />and OVER the OVERRATED 13th(it is overrated FACE IT)Don Coscarelli<br />made this at 23??? And at 23 he blew the doors off so many older<br />directors making HORROR films now. Phantasm does have flaws<br />budget being a big part of it,but also has so much going<br />for it. First a CREEPY story. Dead people are being sent to<br />Hell/another Universe. From a character we only know as<br />The TALL MAN. The Tall Man is a great villan. Also we have<br />GOOD acting from a bunch who have not done to many films.<br />How about music you say?  GREAT soundtrack score that you will<br />be humming long after the movie is over. If you never seen<br />PHANTASM or watched it and say EGH! Please see it again.<br />I really love this film and have 2 disc of it(M.G.M. and<br />Anchor Bay) There is something about a Tall Man taking the<br />dead and shrinking them into dwarves for use as slave labor<br />in Hell and a brain drilling silver sphere that makes me say<br />COOOOOOOOOOOL! PHANTASM! IF THIS MOVIE DOES NOT MAKE YOU SQUIRM<br />OR SHRIEK.....YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD!

B000H0MKOC|4.0|The Merchants of Death, the MOD Squad, meet weekly in a bar for mutual support and to share tales of weal and woe. The Mod Squad consists of three spin masters, one each for the tobacco, alcohol and gun industries. We fallow Nick Naylor played by Aaron Eckhart who is the Spin King of the Tobacco Industry. Nick is great at what he does, and that is talk, or shall we say spin. He does damage control and promotes the tobacco industries. No matter what is thrown at him and regardless of how bad the allegation, Nick is able to make tobacco come out looking like the good guy to his audience.    Nick Naylor does not know the meaning of the word ethics, and won't let them get in the way of his arguments or our laughs. He weaves his way with twisted phrases and the ridiculous spin; you cannot help but laugh, even when you know you shouldn't. He does le his guard down and lets a reporter, played by Katie Holmes, get to close too him and shares too much information with her which she publishes. The only time you see that Nick may have a heart is when he sees that his 12-year old son is starting to follow in his foot steps and spins things to get his way, even his own mother.     This film will have you laughing out loud and though you do not want to, you will be rooting for Nick Naylor. What this movie shows is that all large industries that have the probability of bad press will have spin masters. And we know politicians use them as well. So take a comedic look at how they work.
0143038419|5.0|In my new book \\"Crafting the Travel Guidebook\\" I talk about different categories. There is the travel memoir/essay.  There is also the self-help category that includes all those manuals on how to live a better life that are shelved over in the Religion/Philosophy/Self-Help section of a bookstore. And of course there is the autobiographical memoir that covers a portion of the author's life where a transformation takes place.<br /><br />  And then there are combinations--what I call the \\"magical, mystery tour\\" which can include books on finding oneself through travel and also travel guides to holy or uplifting places.<br /><br />  Eat, Pray, Love is the perfect pairing of the literary travel memoir and the modern \\"I have everything but I'm still not happy so I have to find my inner salvation\\" book. Self-fulfillment tomes can be a bore in some hands, but luckily Elizabeth Gilbert is a very good writer.  She published several magazine articles and a novel or two before she started on this journey and her ability to limn characters (even her own literary one) is evident in her work. There is also the humor and those descriptions of food!<br /><br />  When I saw Gilbert on Oprah I was rather shocked by her appearance. I couldn't believe that this woman with blonde-streaked hair, wearing an off-the-shoulder black cocktail dress stayed at an ashram in India and a village in Bali!  Luckily they displayed background shots of the `real\\" Elizabeth during her voyage and you could see a fairly plain Jane with brown hair done in a simple cut, and a standard issue white blouse. I guess the TV trainers insist that anyone appearing on Oprah has to have an instant glamour makeover.<br /><br />  Let's face it: most of us recovering from a doomed affair or a messy divorce do not have the money or the freedom from responsibility to go off for a year of eating, drinking, practicing meditation and whatnot. So I'm a little envious. And the fact that Elizabeth can attract people and make instant friends is a trait not found in everyone. They ought to put a little label on this book: Do not attempt to try this on your own. After all, the next American woman to set sail after a nasty breakup might find that her pocketbook is stolen in Rome, that she gets food poisoning in India and is attacked by religious fanatics in Indonesia!<br /><br /> But this is a worthwhile journey and most anyone who has gone through a heartbreaking affair or an empty marriage will find some empathy here.  Gilbert wisely forgoes any nasty details relating to her marriage.  Good thing too, because this book has become such a hit, that the ex-husband might sue for libel if anything had been said against him. And when it comes to minute description of characters and culture (rather than of nature and monuments)this woman is a master. I hope she goes on to other things and is not stuck churning out postscripts to Eat,Pray,Love for the rest of her life.trait not found in everyone.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig has done a superb job of brining Ian Fleming's James Bond to life. This has more of the feel of the book than previous Bond films. Dame Judi Dench has been brought back as M to reprise her role, even though this is before her characters time. Who needs continuity when she plays the part so well? And she is a perfect counter balance to the new Bond. I had stopped watching Bond films once I saw the direction they were taking when Sean Connery. For having read all the books, I was always disappointed. But I decided to watch this new release. I enjoyed this film so much that I am actually looking forward to the next. And I do hope the go sequentially through the series and remake the old movies in the same mode as this one. A spy that actually has to work and gets hurt, like the books.     In Casino Royale 007 mission takes him from Madagascar, Montenegro, London, the Bahamas, Miami and finally Venice. The scenery is great and so is the action. You can feel the energy from the action scenes as they take place. We follow Bond as he learns to become a 007 and still keeps his renegade ways. Don't worry there are still Bond girls in the film. Eva Green plays the Sexy Vesper Lynd and has Bonds attention. I was very pleased to see the iconic Astin-Martin in the film; and the new one was rather nice as well. And of course we have our villain Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre, who weeps blood when under stress. From its violence to romance this is the Bond film that will bring back the franchise. A must see.
B000067J1Q|5.0|I resisted watching \\"The Sound of Music\\" for many years.  The plot sounded too sickly sweet to me.  Once I finally broke down and watched this movie from beginning to end, I realized that the movie was sickly sweet, but it was also so compelling and the songs were so catchy that it was impossible to resist this movie.  I know you just can not wait to hear me tell you whether you should have this movie in your collection, so I will tell you now that you should.<br /><br />This movie initially centers on Maria, played by Julie Andrews in one of her first film roles.  Maria is a novitiate at an Abbey in Austria.  Though Maria is earnest, being a nun seems a poor fit with Maria's outgoing and gregarious personality.  The Mother Abbess, played by Peggy Wood in one of the final roles of her career, wisely decides that Maria needs a different perspective on life before facing the decision to take her vows.  The Mother Abbess sends Maria to the Von Trapp family to be the children's governess.<br /><br />We quickly discover that Captain Von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, is a strict disciplinarian.  We immediately see the primary conflict in this movie, one which can only lead to love and marriage as the two dominant personalities recognize that they need the strength of each other to survive in the world.  However, before we get to the excitement that happens later in the movie, Maria needs to remind Captain Von Trapp that families are not armies, and that children need love, not marching and saluting.<br /><br />In the background of the main story is Nazi Germany's ambition of empire that led to the Anschluss or annexation of Austria into Greater Germany.  Captain Von Trapp was a strong Austrian nationalist and was very opposed to the Anschluss.  World events and Nazi Germany's insistence that Captain Von Trapp become a part of the German navy soon overshadow the honeymoon of Maria and Captain Von Trapp.  The end of this movie must count as one of the most awe-inspiring endings ever filmed in a musical.<br /><br />Every scene with Julie Andrews is a treat.  Andrews lights up the screen with her presence and her singing, fully justifying the Academy Award nomination she received for best actress in 1966 and the awards she won from BAFTA, the Golden Globes, and the Laurel Awards.  Andrews' four octave singing voice is the vocal anchor that provides the basis for many of the charming and frequently beautiful songs.  The songs range from soaring to sweet and catchy.  Among these songs are \\"Edelweiss,\\" \\"The Lonely Goatherd,\\" \\"My Favorite Things,\\" \\"Do-Re-Mi\\" and the title song.<br /><br />Though Julie Andrews was certainly a powerful force in this movie, the other stars helped complement Andrews' considerable talents.  Christopher Plummer was outstanding as Captain Von Trapp, though he looks back on his role in this movie with distaste.  The children were outstanding, and did an excellent job of singing and acting.  Some of the children have gone on to extensive acting careers, others left acting after only this movie or a few roles to other activities.  Eleanor Parker was awesome as Baroness Schraeder, the woman we all loved to hate because she came between Maria and the Children and the Captain.<br /><br />I will provide a brief word about the sound and the picture.  I thought the sound was excellent, but I only have a 50\\" television with stereo speakers.  I do not have surround sound connected.  The sound was very good though I have some issues with lower frequency reproduction (I guess I need a subwoofer).  I have a bigger issue with picture quality.  The color keeps shifting between scenes.  In some scenes the color is excellent.  In other scenes, the color seems off.  At first I thought something was wrong with my television, but I checked the quality of the picture against other inputs and realized that the problem was the DVD itself.  The color shifts are often subtle, but in a few places they are annoying.  I hope future releases have this problem fixed.<br /><br />This movie routinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should.  This movie may fall short of being a perfect movie, but I am unable to suggest how it could have been any better.  I have watched multiple releases of this movie multiple times and regardless of the quality of the release, I watch each time almost as though I had never seen the movie before.  You must have this movie in your collection, especially if you are a romantic at heart or have a family.<br /><br />Enjoy!utinely makes top ten lists of the greatest musicals, as well it should.

B0002PZVHK|5.0|Brian Eno's \\"On Land\\" is a good landmark for dark Ambient Music.  Eno knows how to make you feel all alone in the middle of nowhere - or in the middle of somewhere creepy (depending on how you look at it).  I enjoy listening to this music alone in bed before I go to sleep at night.  It instantly clears my mind of whatever may have happened that day, and lets me fall asleep much easier.    This album really does allow you to conjure up some vivid thoughts.  Last time I listened to this album, I for some reason started putting the names of the tracks together as a journey.  I imagined being high up on a mountain peak called \\"Lizard Point\\" and looking far off in the distance and seeing my destination, \\"Dunwich Beach\\".  The rest of the album represents my adventure to get there.  While descending the peak, I pass through dark caves (Shadow), thick murky swamps (Lantern Marsh), and creepy forests with an odd air around (unfamiliar wind).  After some time, I finally see the edge of the forest, and come to \\"A clearing\\".  I go a bit further and arrive at my destination, Dunwich Beach - but I'm all alone and the beach is dark and silent.  Use your imagination, and this album can be more entertaining than just hearing the sounds that make the music.    Eno manages to keep up a dark mood throughout this album, but there is enough variation to keep you entertained.  I personally enjoyed tracks #1, 3, and 6 the most.  There aren't any parts of this album that I disliked, however.  My only complaint is how short the album is!  I wish it took up the full CD, but this won't affect my review score.  This album deserves nothing less than 5 stars.    I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys the darker side of Ambient.  You won't regret purchasing this, unless you only like music with headache-inducing drums and beats (which I do happen to enjoy as well, but I won't go there).
B00005JPWH|5.0|This movie is the kind of movie that will not only inspire to be true to yourself and your dreams, but it will also lead to some deep thought provoking self evaluation.  It's about the journey of a college graduate who needs to go out on his own and find himself, away from the chaos of his family.  For him this means exploring the nation, facing his fears, and living off the land.    He gives away the last of his savings, dumps his old beaten up car, and takes off backpacking in hopes of reaching Alaska.  This story is filled with many life altering friendships that he forms along the way, and many obstacles that help him become a better man.  Its a heart breaker though, things don't always go as planned.
0312995423|3.0|This could have been a great book, but the author chose to mix up a kludge of capabilities, fabrications, and red herrings that in the end do nothing other than irritate the intelligence or digital professional looking for a good read.<br /><br />The \\"chapters\\" are 3-6 page vignettes.  The book is totally out of touch with reality and I seriously question whether the author actually had help from two \\"anonymous\\" NSA employees.<br /><br />NSA is cash poor--it does not pay well, all of the money goes to beltway bandits that over-charge for single-point technology solutions and outsourced butts in seats.<br /><br />There is no 5 story crypto vault.  Crypto is the LEAST important aspect of what NSA does--pattern analysis and finding links between specific communications devices is 80% of what they do.<br /><br />NSA does not run clandestine human agents (at least not legally) and it does not do break & entry, that is done by a special CIA unit that is has been my privilege to help on multiple occasions when I was in the clandestine service.<br /><br />The NSA translation capabilities are largely software, not hardware.<br /><br />Navy Commanders are in their 30's and 40's, not \\"56\\" and certainly not also Deputy Directors of NSA, a flag officer position generally held by a civilian while the Director is a three-star flag officer.<br /><br />Bottom line: this book is flawed on so many levels I explicitly do not recommend it to anyone, professional or casual.<br /><br />A *much* better story was told by Winn Schartau in the late 1980's, see his excellent novel (more truth than fiction), [[ASIN:0962870005 Terminal Compromise]].

1594489505|4.0|I just finished this audiobook in a straight 10-hour period while I listened to my iPod as I refinished my deck. This book certainly does not leave your emotions untouched and most certainly gets you involved intimately with the characters that Hosseini develops.  It is difficult at this point to catalog the full range of emotions that I felt while reading this book.  Righteous indignation may be the main emotion I can recall from most of the pages.  How much I, as a man, wanted to swoop in and solve away all of their problems with my western life of abundance.  On examining this particular desire, perhaps the true message of this book comes out.  It is written completely and totally in a worldview that is very different from us Western readers.  The themes of survival, fate, endurance, are not ones that come to the fore in our minds.  Concepts so important to us in this part of the world such as ambition, achievement, and discovery of dreams keep a place in the forefront of our minds.<br /><br />This is particularly pointed in my mind, since I had just visited DisneyWorld days before reading this book. Their theme is that every girl wants to be a princess and at one point they had the audience chant that \\"Dreams come true\\" and remarked how every boy wants to be a pirate and every girl a princess. The interesting thing is what our dreams are.  They are not the dream shared by the characters in the novel of independence, a motherhood, and freedom from fear. This disney dream is the idea that we will be exalted above our peers, that our extreme abundance will be greater than the extreme abundance of those around us. That our difference, our individuality will give us significance, only possible at the expense of others.<br /><br />This is perhaps why the novel hit me as such an unfamiliar, foreign thing. I was depressed by how everything seemed to go bad for the characters on how there was not a hero -- not a constant juxtaposition of good and bad, of hope and disappointment, that is such a similar genre or phrase used in our modern stories. Eventually as the story waged on, it seemed that surely the scars created in the characters must be too deep, too unrecoverable for there to be a happy, Disney style ending.  So at some point in reading this book I became very frustrated with the seeming desolateness of the emotional landscape, the lack of a knight in shining armor that I wanted to project myself in to the story.<br /><br />In the end, however, I found that redemption was there.  When Lila thought of Miriam as a young girl and I thought of the hopes and dreams of a young girl and how tragically shattered they were, this touched deep inside me and created a desire to be a father who nurtured and protected the sanctity of his child's dreams.  Not dreams to be a princess, but dreams to be a mother themselves dreams to be free from fear and dreams to hope and a future. I closed the book resolute to make these dreams a reality for all daughters.such a similar genre or phrase used in our modern stories.

B000BF0D9M|5.0|This CD set is a great sampling of Jesse Cook.  If your just tuning in, or on a tight budget, get this CD set.  Otherwise, I reccomend getting ALL his other CD/Albums individually.  I ordered Gravity and Vertigo at the same time I purchased this one and there is a lot of cross over.  Had I done it over, I would have just purchased the two single albums - Gravity & Vertigo - and would not buy this one.  Since I own them all now (not a bad thing *smile*) I will just give this set to my sister who is not a Jesse Cook fan yet :)
B00005JKHN|5.0|When 'Sleeping Beauty' was first released it was the target of critical villification--perhaps because of the more stylized art work. The art work is actually a leap forward from 'Snow White' and the earlier classics. It took me awhile to get used to the new technique when I first viewed the film--but now I recognize how effectively it manages to convey the \\"feel\\" of a genuine fairy-tale.<br /><br />A nice discussion of the art work is featured in 'The Making of Sleeping Beauty' which accompanies the latest VHS release of the film. Aside from the richly textured backgrounds and brilliant animation, 'Beauty' is blessed with the rapturous singing voice of Mary Costa's light soprano doing full justice to the ballad, 'Once Upon A Dream'. The idea of using Tchaikovsky's 'Sleeping Beauty' music for the background score and songs was an excellent decision. Music is used throughout to emphasize either the bright or darker moments in the story, always very effectively. Choral work is superb, as are the orchestrations.<br /><br />This is a film that can be enjoyed on so many different levels--music, animation, story, art work--it ranks with the very best of the classic fairy-tales from Disney. And yes, Maleficent, in all of her wicked glory, makes the most impressive fire-breathing dragon you're ever likely to see!<br /><br />Just acquired the 2-Disc DVD version and it's a fascinating Collector's Item for anyone truly interested in this animated classic, with all the extra features giving you \\"the whole package\\" on Disney's back story and illustrating how the film was conceived from the start. It also gives you the option of Fullscreen or Widescreen versions.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Paolo Nutini makes a huge splash with his debut album, These Streets. Paolo displays a natural talent for singing and songwriting; and his voice is rich and full of masculine warmth. Just one listen to this CD proves it!<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"Jenny Don't Be Hasty.\\" Paolo sings with the style of a seasoned pro; this number about a woman he wants makes a strong start for this album! The electric guitar, drums and percussion make a good musical arrangement. \\"Last Request,\\" another highlight of this fantastic album; lets Paolo sing with great sensitivity of how he wants one last time alone with a woman who doesn't love him anymore. The melody charms me with its beauty; and I predict that you will enjoy \\"Last Request\\" very, very much.<br /><br />\\"These Streets,\\" the title track of this album, begins with some pretty awesome guitar; and when Paolo comes in this number takes off like a jet! Paolo laments losing his childhood because in retrospect he realizes things were simpler for him back then. The guitar works wonders for this number; and the guitar alone with Paolo's voice makes \\"These Streets\\" a true masterpiece!<br /><br />\\"White Lies\\" has another beautiful arrangement for the guitar; and \\"Loving You\\" lets Paolo sing happily of finding his one true love. Paolo also shows off his wide vocal range, sometimes singing a few words in falsetto--flawless!<br /><br />The album ends with \\"Alloway Grove.\\" This number starts with the drums and guitar; and when Paolo comes in he sings this perfectly! Paolo sings of his disappointment that the girl he loves is no longer there for him. The upbeat melody belies the sadness of the lyrics; but it all works well for Paolo and his musicians. The lengthy number works well.<br /><br />The liner notes include the lyrics to all the songs except for some of the lyrics to \\"Alloway Grove;\\" and the artwork impresses me. We get some good shots of Paolo, too.<br /><br />Paolo Nutini's first album sounds like a tour de force of a very seasoned talent--which is truly phenomenal since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.<br /><br />Great job, Paolo!since he's still rather young and this is only his first CD. I highly recommend this CD for fans of comparatively mellow rock and pop vocals.     Great job, Paolo!

1596912855|1.0|If you happen to be 10-13, you'll probably enjoy this because that is the level at which it's written. There's very little depth. I thought, perhaps, that listening to it would make it better. It didn't, it made it worse. If you enjoy Austen for her wit, her understanding of the human condition of her time, this is not for you. If you've suddenly run out of Barbara Cartland or Judy Blume this might hold you.     Basically, if you enjoy Austen, instead of wasting your time with this, pick up one of your well-worn copies of P&P and read that instead.    Unfortunately, for all of us who really enjoy Austen, she's become a cottage industry. All you have to do is to base your book on one of her books and you're published.    This is a case in point.
0307120007|5.0|Before I owned this book, I never really understood its allure.  It seemed like it wasn't really brightly colored enough to hold my daughter's interest.  Boy was I wrong!  She has loved this book from the time she was about 8 months old.  She's now almost 2 and it's still one of her favorites.  She especially loves the little hole representing the mummy's ring and always wants to put her finger in my ring too.  The one problem with the book is that it's not at all sturdy...but then again, it is quite well loved.
B000G8NVHA|5.0|I was always a fan of Christina Aguilera's but I was hesitant about this CD simply because it was a throwback album.  Boy was I wrong!  She does it again with her soulful voice and the amazing voice control.  She was purely fantastic!!!  5 stars all the way!!!
0634022296|5.0|Look, I'm as cheap as the next guy, and so for a while I attempted to download guitar chords for Beatles songs from the net. But while some of the stuff I downloaded was OK, none of it was as good as the stuff in this book. The chords in this book are incredibly accurate--if they aren't the exact chords the Beatles played, they definitely SOUND like the chords they played--and in the proper keys.<br /><br />The authors also provide chord diagrams for every chord in every song at the top of the song, and these show cases where an unconvention fingering is required, or where something other than the open chord is used (e.g. if one A is the standard open A, and the second is the 5th fret one, that is clearly noted). That's an incredible help, since so often chord music just tells you the name of the chord and leaves it to you to determine which version of that chord to play.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough to anyone looking to strum Beatles songs on their guitars. It's the best guitar chord book I've ever seen for ANY group, period.<br /><br />On top of that, it's a bargain.<br /><br />The only downside of this book is that it's a bit hard to keep the book open to the page you want, since the pages aren't huge and the binding it tight. But given how good this book is, I can live with that.<br /><br />5 stars out of 5, and no reservations (other than the quibble about keeping the book open).<br /><br />(I wish they'd come out with another volume covering the Beatles' solo output!)
B00020HEL6|5.0|[[ASIN:B00020HEL6 Renee Olstead]] This young lady has a tremendous voice and a real feel for the musical genre that is certainly not main stream top 40. A sharp contrast to what most her age would be listening to. Forget about her age and pay attention to this soulful artist.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Based on a true story, \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" is a heartwarming film about Chris (Will Smith), a down on his luck father who is struggling to get ahead in life and provide for his young son (played by Will's real-life son, Jaden Smith). Chris attempts to dig himself out of an unsuccessful career as a salesman and get a job as a stockbroker instead. Seeing as how he has no stockbroking skills, Chris needs to start from the bottom up, and he manages to acquire a prestigious internship with a brokerage firm. Unfortunately the internship is unpaid, and Chris finds himself struggling to secure money for food and shelter. He and his son end up in a homeless shelter, and Chris hopes that his six-month internship will pay off with a job offer in the end.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film. It illustrates how even the most hardworking people can end up on the streets through absolutely no fault of their own. Both of the Smith boys did a great job in the movie, and they had me cheering with them and crying for them the whole way through. What an inspiring movie!

0792844882|3.0|This has to be one of the worst movies ever written/acted.<br /><br />That being said, it's highly entertaining.<br /><br />As a stripper, I suppose I have a unique perspective on the movie, but I have to say that many parts of it are highly inaccurate to the point of being ridiculous.  Nomi's co-workers in the Cheetah club are portrayed as all being sentimental sweethearts toward one another, the strippers in the movie don't carry purses or guard their money in any way, etc., etc., etc.<br /><br />The one thing the movie does have going for it is the quality of the camera work.  Every scene in the movie looks flawless.<br /><br />I couldn't stop laughing at this movie.  The main character is an absolute spaz, and the \\"high-end\\" Vegas show is hilarious--(how can they all look so serious when their breasts are flopping around everywhere and they're making spastic motions with all four limbs??)<br /><br />For those looking for authenticity, good-acting, and a good script, BEWARE.  For those looking for ironic humor, really fake lap dance/sex scenes, beautiful women, and high-quality camera work, enjoy!<br /><br />(I'm laughing just thinking about it...)
B000R7GKQE|5.0|It was a really great season and I think if you are a Smallville fan you should be a Supernatural fan. This particular season was really great and Amazon got it out to me in no time. I highly recommend this season to anyone who likes good television!

0618135871|4.0|As an avid fan of Philip Roth, the one series I have failed to appreciate is the David Kepesh series.  While I enjoyed \\"The Breast\\", \\"The Professor of Desire\\" and \\"The Dying Animal\\" seem to be below the talent of Roth.  While sexuality is often a part of Roth's work, Kepesh seems to focus on this facet of life as a person ages.  This is not to say these are bad books, they just do not meet the standard of his other works.    \\"The Dying Animal\\" sees Kepesh as an aged professor with failed marriage and angry son still in tow.  Kepesh now explores his lusts exclusively through his profession, despite being eligible for senior citizen discount in many states.  Kepesh's desire focuses squarely on a 24 year old student of Cuban descent named Consuela Castillo.  She is more than a source of physical pleasure to him, but a object of perfection.  His borderline worship of Consuela takes him to some deviant explorations.  But when Consuela contacts him years after their afair with worries of her own mortality, the promiscuous Kepesh must examine his own mortality through the very object he worships.    Initially, one may feel unclean after reading this Kepesh story.  However, it address an interesting perspective which few live with a sense of authenticity.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Alright, first, it needs to be said that reviews on Amazon are supposed to be voted on by \\"WAS IT HELPFUL\\" in your decision to purchase. It isn't really meant to be \\"I already own it and loved/hated it--so this review is bad/good.\\" Having said this--some of the reviews I have read herein are real stunners. We cannot usually listen to something ONCE in a store music cubicle and write a review or even make a decision.<br /><br />  I am a serious Annie Lennox fan and collector of 24 years(I have it ALL!)and am also in a place to be surrounded by extraordinary music (I am the personal assistant of vocal legend Yma Sumac) and know good from bad musically. And 'Songs of Mass Destruction' does NOT disappoint.<br /><br />  Many Lennox fans or passing admirers are addicted to her early 80's days of electro-pop (I adore it as well!) but we must understand that we all grow (or should!) and times change! And the artist changes!  Lennox has NEVER made music for mass appeal or radio play or to be popular. She is less interested (based on my decades of research)in making you DANCE, than she is in making you FEEL or identify in some way.<br /><br />  SONGS OF MASS DESTRUCTION is one of those very rare albums where you can't only choose a few good songs as \\"the best\\". Each track has something considerably special about it. There are very upbeat tracks, some Delta blues kind of songs and some intensely sentimental slower tracks. Unlike many other singers (including opera singers) whose voices weaken by their 50's, Annie's has gone very much the other direction! That's amazing! Her voice is stronger and more clear than ever on this CD. Her vocals SOAR with great strength on 'Through the Glass Darkly' and it should be noted that on this album she experiemnts with higher registers than ever before (namely on 'Fingernail Moon' and the exceptional 'Big Sky'). Everyone I know, is INSANE over 'Ghosts in My Machine' and I have not yet heard feedback on the bumping-pumping 'Sing!' but I love it. The angry and fed-up \\"Love is Blind\\" (which is not really about love, as much as how damned hard life can be sometimes!) is not for the generally jovial!  I could go on and on, but you get the idea. There is so much offered on this CD!  I do recommend it.<br /><br />  Now this NOT recommended for the \\"Gimme, Gimme More\\" Britney Spears listener, who wants \\"a good beat so you can DANCE to it!\\" Dumbed-down lyrics are not Lennox's specialty! This is for people, perhaps a little over 25, who have had a little more time to  really experience life's up and downs (not to say that all ages can't enjoy it or identify in some way).  I cannot help but feel that women and gay men will somehow feel closer to this album.-up \\"Love is Blind\\" (which is not really about love, as much as how damned hard life can be sometimes!) is not for the generally jovial!

0143038419|1.0|The concept is interesting, but the follow through is weak and false.<br />  We read this book for our book club last year and only one member had anything positive to say (\\"how liberating!\\"). The author has a crisis and gets paid to wander the world, 'searching' for herself.  Italy was fabulous; who wouldn't want to spend three months eating through Italy? But stepping back from the 'memoir', who has that kind of time and money? Oh, yeah.  A journalist getting paid to discover herself after she flees from her problems. Yes, we all would love to do that in some capacity, but it isn't possible (financially or emotionally) and it isn't really a healthy way to deal with Life. She is also without children, so that makes it easy for her to split.<br /><br />Most of the women reading this, _in_my_opinion_, have the 'American Dream'(2.2 children, mortgage, regular responsibilities, paycheck to paycheck) where people are affected by even the smallest changes. The author assumes  that what she's accomplishing is constructive, and the Reader is taken along to learn from her mistakes and observations. MMMM, okay.  I really felt it was a glorification of running away to weird experiences that only wealthy, unencumbered women can do. If you didn't like the Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood book because it was a novel about wealthy, drunk, abusive moms (hated it), you're probably not gonna like this one either.

As I read different abilities and disabilities associated with the \\"disorder,\\" I recognized many of my friends and relatives as having at least some shades of the disorder.  Perhaps there are more Aspies out there that this book would help with \\"self-diagnosis\\" and \\"self-help\\" than anyone really knows.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|I see that I'm not the only person who came home from the film to order the soundtrack. What a lovely, beautifully made, spare and perfect little gem of a film. It brought back great memories for me of busking in the Paris Metro with my good friends Bartek, Mareck and Marcel, then going back to our apartments to jam and record into the night.    There is a kind of love shared between musicians who jam well together that is different than any other kind of love. It's a pure love of the music itself, that spills over into an upwelling of heartfelt appreciation for the people who made the music with you. The film captured this spirit perfectly.    The songs are by turns touching, sweet, funny, haunting, challenging and thought-provoking. Running like a golden thread through each song is the musicians' obvious love of music itself.    It's so exciting to \\"discover\\" musicians whose songs makes you want to grab your guitar and play along. If you like indie singer-songwriter music, I think you'll love this soundtrack.
B00005JPTA|5.0|\\"Eastern Promises\\" is brilliant! The cast led by Viggo Mortensen (in a career-best performance as Nikolai), Naomi Watts (as Anna), Vincent Cassel (as Kirill), and Armin Mueller-Stahl (terrific as Semyon) is brilliant! The directing by David Cronenberg (who also directed \\"A History Of Violence\\" (2005), which also starred Mortensen in also another terrific performance as Tom Stall), is brilliant! The screenplay by Steven Knight (who also did the story and screenplay to \\"Amazing Grace\\" (2006) & \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" (2002) is brilliant! The crew that worked with Cronenberg in \\"A History Of Violence\\" are back, as well. The music by Howard Shore (who also did the music to \\"The Departed\\" (2006) is brilliant!

This is brilliant, masterful, and intelligent! This is the best film of the year, so far. Cronenberg, Mortensen, and Knight should be remembered for their work, come Oscar time. This is just as brilliant, if not better, than \\"A History Of Violence\\".
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|The plot is conventional--betrayal of a loyal soldier by a sleazeball assemblage of government types.  The soldier must then fight the system to clear himself (against insuperable odds, etc. etc.).  What makes this film special are the performances and the direction.  All of the sniper/technology issues are handled expertly and while the film pushes standard emotional-response buttons it pushes them very, very well.  It may just be me, but I wouldn't call a self-effacing, loyal soldier \\"Swagger\\" and I wouldn't shoot a scene in Canada and then label it the Wind River Valley in Wyoming.  The Wind River Valley doesn't look like this and it's a place that a lot of viewers of the film will have seen.  Aside from those reservations, this is well worth seeing.  Wahlberg continues to make excellent choices.
B000GIWRIY|5.0|My affection for Jethro Tull has survived long after I outgrew The Doors, Stones, and Who. Like Eric Clapton, the group has matured (and aged) with great consistency and elegance. Roots to Branches is one of their best records, with one wonderful piece after another. The Middle Eastern/East Indian influences are as smoothly integrated as any of Paul Simon's best fusion. If you didn't recognize the belly dance foundation of \\"Rare and Precious Stones,\\" it would still be a great dance tune. And, of course, sexy.<br /><br />The dog song, the child prostitute, the reduction of warfare to village battles over water, the grim nostalgia of Harry's Bar -- It all comes back to me. Got to have the remaster, even without new tracks. This is how rock becomes music for the ages.

0143038419|5.0|I listened to this book on cd and the author's reading of the book along with her wit and willingness to share her innermost feelings of her journey left me inspired, entertained and hopeful.    I am disappointed at the reviewers who refer to her as a narcissist. Of course the book was filled with many \\"I\\" statements, but that was what the book was about, \\"her\\" journey.  Do you want someone to write a book about their spiritual journey and then \\"tell you\\" how to think?     I think she gives her readers a lot more credit than that.  She opens up herself for the world and lets the reader determine the relevance of her experiences in their own lives for themselves. I think that the one star critics of this book are just looking for a quick fix and don't want to admit that someone of means can still feel desperate, lonely and depressed. It takes courage to share as she has done and courage to make her journey even if she had a advance deal on a book. I think her book proves a very valid point that some people may be afraid to look at because they are chasing goals that they believe will make them happy (such and a good job, nice house, husband that doesn't beat you etc) and they see from this that those things in life are not what really brings you happiness.    This book is not only well written, and witty, most of all it is inspirational.  It inspires the reader to think for themselves, to draw their own conclusions and to gain wisdom and knowledge from another's experience. I would say read it for what it was meant to be and you will find a message for yourself in the book.

1401300529|5.0|\\"The Coldest Winter,\\" David Halberstam's final journalistic tribute to heroes, is a fitting tribute to the men of the oft forgotten war.   Halberstam's lengthy career in journalism and as an author shows in his brilliant writing style that keeps you engrossed in every word. It is not surprising that someone who has written so much about Vietnam, would have a huge resource to draw upon in a work about the Korean War.   The Coldest Winter is a story that needed telling, much the way Herodotus told of the men of Thermopylae or, more recently how Stephen Ambrose told of the men of Easy Company in \\"Band of Brothers.\\"     Halberstam understood well how most Americans ignore the events and outcome of the Korean Conflict; often, that part of history seems better left untold. The Coldest Winter tells this story and it's back stories and even it's substantial post-script. We mustn't forget that South Korea's success today owes a debt to the American and U.N. forces who fought there over half a century ago.   What Halberstam also does in this book is point out the miserable failings of Generals like MacArthur, long-time sacred cows of the World Wars, whose hubris in later life jeopardized the legacy of any truly heroic deeds of their early careers. General Ned Almond is also lambasted for his stubbornness and poor leadership style, which Halberstam shows led to unnecessary losses of American and U.N. forces.   While \\"Coldest Winter\\" is by no means concise as far as a historiography goes, Halberstam has revealed the machinations that led to the war and the egos that sustained it. This is not a blow-by-blow, battlefield-to-battlefield account of the Korean War, much of the latter part of the war is overlooked. But, it covers the broader picture and the political implications and ramifications of American civilian policy versus military instinct in the early 1950s, however poor it may have served us.   The Coldest Winter is a hefty book, at over 650 pages, broken into eleven sections with over 50 chapters, but it reads as fast as it reads brilliant.   This is the first Halberstam book I have read, I regret that it comes only after his passing. There were certainly more great works to come had he not met his untimely death.   REVIEW EVERY BOOK YOU READ, OTHER READERS, PUBLISHERS AND AUTHORS DESERVE YOUR OPINIONS TOO.

The music is amazing, almost every single song on the film is catchy and will have you singing it because it gets stuck in your head. \\"Suddenly, Seymour\\" literally gives me chills every time I hear it. This movie was made in 1986 and it hasn't aged at all 21 years later. The look of everything from the location to Audrey II, it couldn't have been done better if it was made now. Overall, this movie deserves all of the praise it gets and it is a have to see movie that will become one of your favorites after you watch it. It is just an amazing movie that will continue on for a long time to come
0156027321|5.0|A great book should not only answer questions, but lead us to ask questions about the very nature of our lives: our perceptions and beliefs.  This book delivers all of that and more.  Life of Pi is an amazing literary journey that carries the reader through the life of a young boy as he experiences life and becomes a man, a postmodern bildungsroman.  It's all here: relationships with parents, God, nature, humanity, love, adventure, a quest for meaning, and a survival story.  This is the stuff life is made of!<br /><br />Martel is an apt storyteller, and this tale drips with allegory, symbolism, and skillful description.  I didn't want it to end.  I felt so connected to the story and characters, unlike any story I've read recently.  I'm so grateful for the journey.  Wow.

B00005JKGK|5.0|A Masterpiece and a \\"Must See\\" movie that you can watch over and over again and each time gain a new and deeper understanding of the vastness of human emotions and the well of sadness that we all collectively share.  \\"Must be Born Like This\\"!
B00003CXC7|2.0|I didn't really care for this movie and I don't think it belongs in AFI's top 100 movies. The acting is definitely the best part of this movie. I mean you can't really go wrong with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. But It is not enough to make this a good movie in my opinion. I believe this movie is shot all from one room. The movie is mostly dialogue between Stewart and whomever  is in his room at the time. During the times where there is no dialogue the camera is panning into the other windows of the courtyard. Stewart really doesn't have much evidence to go on but he is convinced one of his neighbors killed  his own wife. The movie builds and builds until we find out he is right. There are no twists, He and his girlfriend are threatened twice but it's really not that threatening. I think it's a good idea but Hitchcock missed on this one.
0385522401|5.0|This is the first novel of McEwen's that I have read, and I feel the loss now. I found On Chesil Beach mesmerizing and unforgettable.<br /><br />McEwen describes sexual matters explicitly but certainly not pornographically. Sex is a metaphor for human connection and for human understanding, both of which are sadly lacking here. There are no villains, no heroes, just human beings, flawed like all of us, individuals like all of us, who make unfortunate decisions in a moment of crisis.<br /><br />An outstanding short novel.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|First of all it pisses me off that they're not releasing both movies together exactly the way they were shown in the theater, on DVD. They should at least give us the option of buying them together or separately. Secondly, this is the \\"Extended and unrated, 2 disc, special edition\\" yet the fake movie previews (that I felt were an important part of the movie)are nowhere to be found on either disc! That's why I'm giving this 2 stars.     As for the movie itself, I liked \\"Planet Terror\\" better than \\"Death Proof\\". Death Proof, is a good movie but A LOT  of the dialogue between the girls is EXHAUSTING. Kurt Russell is fantastic as Stuntman Mike! I'd like to see him take on more villainous roles. The stunts are spectacular! They don't make movies like these anymore and I praise QT for bringing this style of movie making back into the light. I noticed 2 main differences between this extended version and the theatrical version. One is that we now get to see the missing lap dance footage in the bar. It's a good scene but i think it added to the charm of the movie when it was missing. Also we get to see when Stuntman Mike finds the second group of girls. This scene should not have been left out of the theater. For one it's a really good scene shot in Black and white, and secondly it provides knowledge to the viewer that is helpful in putting the whole film together.     I give the movie itself 3 1/2 stars. I really like everything, but the overdone dialogue DOES take it's tole on the film. I know that is a signature of Tarantino but this is too much and it's kind of getting old.
B000UJ24SC|4.0|Nocturnal is similar to \\"Miasma\\" With a slightly larger spectrum of music. While not straying far from the style of \\"Miasma\\", such songs as 'To a Breathless Oblivion' and 'Warborn' showcase musicianship not previously achieved in the previous albums. If you liked the previous album, or are just a fan of melodic death/black metal, Nocturnal is enough to make you grin and then rip off the face it is attached to.
B00005JPRZ|3.0|\\"Death at a Funeral\\" perhaps conjures up images of \\"Three Funerals and a Wedding\\".  This is most unfair.  \\"Death at a Funeral\\" is poor imitation of its predecessor.  Many in the cinema where I saw this film roared with laughter.  I was left somewhat cold.<br /><br />Although a very British comedy, \\"Death at a Funeral\\" simply fails to deliver.  The essence of the story is the death of a man of about seventy whose funeral is being held in the family home.  An eclectic group of mourners arrive including a lawyer off his face with acid, a dwarf gay lover and other assorted family eccentrics.  Their various mishaps did sometimes cause a wry smile but, overall, the humour was laboured.  British humour has much to offer.  It is typically far more subtle than its American counterpart which tends to rely too much on the obvious.  Yet, somehow, this film just failed to deliver.<br /><br />Perhaps, I'm just a party pooper?  Equally, perhaps this film just doesn't quite click.  You be the judge.  I suspect though that it's the latter.  That is, there is something missing.  It doesn't quite click.
B000VT55G4|1.0|I never heard of this movie - preview here looked decent - I thought ehh - for $0.99 cents - it's got Freeman and Cusack in it - it's gotta be decent.      Wrong.  It was terrible.  The basic story line was just fine.  Execution acting - interaction - very poor.  Honestly it was a 'B' movie at best.  If you were hoping for a great or decent movie for your weekend - pass on this one.
0439813786|5.0|My 11-year-old son read this book in 2 days. He absolutely loved it, both the illustrations and the writing. \\"I liked the way the pictures told the story,\\" he said. He wants to read more Brian Selznick now. Great books for boys don't grow on trees; this is a real winner.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Rihanna has arrived! This album ROCKS baby! Love the first 5 songs on the CD.<br />1.) Umbrella - I liked the rap/rock sound of this track right away. Very catching and definately listened to multiple times.<br />2.) Push up on Me - Great rhythm to the song. I can easily see this song becomming a dance favorite.<br />3.) Don't Stop the Music - Destined to become a hit at every dance floor. I can even imagine this song being played at football games and sporting events.<br />4.) Breaking Dishes - This song has some extreme kick to it! Great rhythm.<br />5.) Shut Up and Drive - Another favorite song on the CD. I like the flow of the song. Great listening and has an exciting sound.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is good sounding, but the above 5 songs are my favorites. I have given it repeated listening and would recommend it to anyone.
B00007AJF9|5.0|1998's \\"Elizabeth\\" is an excellent dramatization of the early years of Queen Elizabeth I of England.  A young and naive Elizabeth (superbly played by Cate Blanchett) came to the throne in a time of religious war, national rivalry, and cutthroat politics.  Aided by the sound advice of her advisors and guided by her own intelligence and instincts, she survives a series of threats to her throne and to England to become the legendary Virgin Queen.<br /><br />The story opens as \\"Bloody Mary\\", Catholic Queen of England and barren wife of King Philip of Spain, lies dying.  The throne passes to her  Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth, who is taken in hand by her courtiers, most notably the experienced Sir William Cecil (played with an attractive mixture of patience and urgency by Richard Attenborough).  Elizabeth is immediately faced with complicated responsibilities as queen, not least of which her need to balance her love for the Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes) against the demand of her advisors that she marry a suitable royal to build alliances for England.<br /><br />Elizabeth quickly learns to make her own decisions in walking a narrow line between contending religious and political factions with the aid of her intelligence master, Sir Francis Walsingham (played with pitch-perfect sinster aspect by Geoffrey Rush).  The supreme challenge to her throne comes from the ambitious and powerful Duke of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), who makes alliances with both friend and enemy in a plot to overturn Elizabeth. To survive, Elizabeth must demonstrate that she has mastered the lessons of power.<br /><br />This movie is well-casted, superbly staged, reasonably faithful to the historical record, and features Cate Blanchett in her first real starring role.  It is highly recommended to fans of historical dramas and to fans of the Elizabeathan era.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|In a day and age where many movies are simply fluff, this movie has shone beyond many others in being profound, moving, and overall a powerful story. It gives us a great survey of complex human emotions, mental illness, perseverance, love and ambition.<br /><br />The character development is wonderful. Paul Bettany is simply FANTASTIC here. Particularly vivid in this film is the portrait of a genius gone schizophrenic (Russel Crowe) and a loving wife who is at her wits end but still responds in a loving and caring way (Jennifer Connelly).<br /><br />The setting of this film, being Princeton, adds to the overall esthetics of the film. The scenery is simply marvelous!<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie!!
0880793589|5.0|This book comes with poker-like cards to remind you think different all the time. You will find that it is the small book that you will reread again and again! To me, it is just like a tool. Every one should read to break the ordinary thoughts.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Definitely worth the purchase. For me it's their best album since Presto. I enjoyed the albums since that one, but Snakes & Arrows has that special something. More than on the previous couple albums, Neil's lyrics are poetic while the message is completely comprehensible. As usual, their instrumentation is unbelieveable, but also a cut above. For example, I find myself still listening to the three instrumentals five months after the purchase, whereas Limbo and Where's My Thing? felt repetitive to me.     It comes down to personal taste, but this album is slowly becoming one of my favorites.
B000F5GO0A|2.0|Beirut certainly has a pretty sound... but it lacks the aggressiveness that is characteristic of a Balkan brass band.  The music is laid back and lazy.  And while the band seems to consist of talented musicians, Condus' trumpet isn't anything special.  I don't understand why this band has become popular.      The band, for whatever reason, plays Balkan music but names themselves after a Middle Eastern city.  There sound doesn't really describe, in my opinion, the sound which makes these regions so great.       I've even heard this band compared to the Janissary-Turkish sound, but I don't hear that either.     I would stay away from this album if your looking for authentic Balkan-gypsy folk music... or anything that sounds like it has spirit.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Ive been browsing through the Blu-ray review websites and most of them gave a poor score for this release of Dracula. So I was skeptical of buying this since all the poor reviews. But I decided to give it a shot and OMG! When I turned this movie on it was just an amazing blu-ray release of Dracula! All the colors are natural and the movie is 14 years old but it looks like a brand new movie just made! This is the BEST release of Dracula, and if you love the movie then you wont be dissappointed with this HD release of Dracula!
B00005JOHC|5.0|Two and a Half Men took so long to be released on DVD, and I don't know why such a long time, as this is the most well succeeded and wisely written comedy shows of the last years. Better late than never, this box set brings a revival of the entire first season along with the typical DVD extras: interviews with cast and crew, set tours and cut scenes.<br /><br />Anxiously, I hope to see the next aired seasons on DVD soon. There are some countries where the second season is already on sale for a while, so it should take not much longer to see this released everywhere else.

B00005JPWF|4.0|The true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who leaves a hefty scholarship to Emory U.in 1992 puts a new face on the old saying,\\"Go West,young man,go West!\\"   Sean Penn has taken Jon Krakauer's book and boiled it down to one theme: the finding of self-knowledge through forsaking all.Not since St.Francis of Assisi left all his wealth and familial bonds to serve Christ in  BROTHER SUN,SISTER MOON has come a film where one man leaves all,not to follow Christ in this case, but to undertake his own \\"spiritual journey\\" as he experiences life with nature and people on his way to Alaska.  Emile Hirsch is so perfect in this role,that his charm and innocence are refreshing.Hirsch IS McCandless or \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" as he knights himself.The film is told from several perspectives:McCandless',his sister's (Jena Malone) and his parents (an amazing Marcia Gay Harden and stoic ol'William Hurt).Everyone is affected by Chris' decision.Penn shows us from what Chris is running from and to where he is running which will eventually lead to his death.Between those polar opposites,is a heartfelt tale of a man in love with the universe.That's not a spoiler.It was a well known newspaper fact when this story broke.Still we will root all the way as Chris tries to survive over 100 days in wilderness alone.He will lose, but we will win from an example well set by a young idealist who \\"grabbed all the gusto\\" and \\"went out in a blaze of glory!\\"   The film clocks in in over two-and-a-half hours,so hunker down for an interesting journey INTO THE WILD.  Also starring Catherine Keener,Vince Vaughn (a surprising excellent performance) and Hal Holbrook as an old \\"leather tramp\\" named Ron.It is Holbrook's role, though, that is the real pro-acting of this film.It's a small role, but the noms will come.

No regrets!  Good job kids!!  This release is FAR superior.  The colors are far more vibrant in this version and some of the extra material is quite interesting.<br /><br />Plus, this has been re-released in its original aspect ratio making it the closest DVD release to the original theatrical release.  This is absolutely a Disney Classic and is the last movie Walt Disney worked on before his death.  This is a MUST have for your Disney film collection.
B000UJ48XG|5.0|Beirut have always been all about Europe. Ever since Zach Condon started mingling electronica and indie-rock with traditional East-European music, his little band has been redolent of the old world.<br /><br />And though \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" has a more modern flavour to some of its songs, the feeling of wistful, melancholy nostalgia still hangs heavily over these exquisitely orchestrated pop tunes. Think early twentieth-century France, as seen through sepia photographs and a band's sad tunes.<br /><br />It opens with a haunting chorus of wailing horns, before switching to the smooth, swaying melody of \\"Nantes.\\" Condon sings mournfully, \\"Well it's been a long time/long time now/since I've seen you smile/and I'll gamble away my fright... and in a year, a year or so/this will slip into the sea...\\"<br /><br />It's much the same throughout the remaining songs, which tend to be bittersweet in tone, with a backdrop of horns and stately pop rhythms. Mellow dance tunes, Eastern European marches, mournful accordion-piano ballads, and pretty folky tunes. Not to mention, of course, combinations of all of the above.<br /><br />In the second half, we're even graced with some upbeat songs -- the twittering violin and swirling melody of \\"In The Mausoleum.\\" And the sprightliest music on the album is \\"Un Dernier Verre (Pour La Route),\\" a peppy pop tune that sounds like something Snoopy would dance to as the World War I flying ace.<br /><br />If I were to compare Condon and Beirut to any other artist, it would probably be Sufjan Stevens -- polished, multilayered music with rich vocals. But the music of \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" is all nostalgia, bittersweet and weariness, mingled with a rich, over-the-top quality. It's so much BIGGER than Beirut's past work -- in sound, in scope, in feeling.<br /><br />Not to mention that the sound here is a bit less Balkan -- think electro-indie mingled with vintage pop melodies, then filtered through an old French radio. Lots of mellow accordion, mingled brass, rattling drums and tambourine, an acoustic guitar, some twittery fiddle melodies and a nimble, energetic piano. Here are there, a gentle layer of keyboard is laid over it all.<br /><br />Condon's voice is the clincher -- this guy is not only a great musician, but he has a smooth, rich voice that slides through the music like a satin ribbon. And his songs are evocative and stirring (\\"A plague on the workhouse!\\"), with plenty of feeling (\\"what melody will lead my lover from his bed?/What melody will see him in my arms again?\\").<br /><br />Beirut's second album is a stunning artistic triumph, draped in classic melodies, exquisite songwriting and sweeping instrumentation. \\"The Flying Club Cup\\" flies on its own.stic guitar, some twittery fiddle melodies and a nimble, energetic piano.

B000V4UFZK|5.0|I suspect a large majority of the people on here complaining about the lack of film related extras on this new DVD haven't actually viewed the restored film itself.<br /><br />Yes, it is absolutely ridiculous that Warner couldn't have put more effort into the extras, and the extras on this disc are incredibly pointless. The picture and audio quality on the disc however is AMAZING, vastly superior to the original disc. I have done extensive comparisons and the first thing I checked was the neighborhood title sequence, which was riddled with dirt on the original DVD. Not so on this new disc! They are lovely and clean. The same goes for the edge enhancement and grain, which plagued the original disc. The contrast, black levels and color definition have also been greatly improved.<br /><br />The extras are not worth wasting your time on, but for anybody wanting this film looking and sounding the best it possibly can on standard definition DVD... LOOK NO FURTHER!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Five years ago, I declared that Bruce Springsteen was Officially Finished after his album The Rising, a celebration of 9/11 that was pretty bland, pretentious and terrible.<br /><br />But three terrific albums later (Devils & Dust, The Seeger Sessions, and now Magic), the lesson, as always, is clear: I'm an idiot. If you haven't bought Magic yet, you should. On its own merits, it is an album more than worthy of Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />I knew Magic was officially a great album this weekend, when I  involuntarily reached for the volume in the car during \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\". And cranked it.<br /><br />I'm not going to get into any comparisons, or say wild stuff like \\"This is his best album since The River!\\" But let's just say that I got so fired up about Magic this weekend that I did bust out The River and cranked THAT, just to make the comparison.<br /><br />(Of course The River kicks Magic to the curb. Let's not get too crazy here.)<br /><br />I think Springsteen knew deep down that The Rising was a stinker, and I give him all the credit in the world for bouncing back like he has.  Springsteen brought out the hooks for this new album, and you can hear them on \\"You'll Be Comin' Down\\", \\"Livin' In The Future\\", and most notably \\"Girls In Their Summer Clothes\\".<br /><br />Yes, the sound of Magic is extremely derivative of his past 70s glories, but why not? Deep down, Springsteen is a huge competitor. I remember watching some music awards show many years back, when Bruce blew away an earnest but overmatched Jacob Dylan off the stage, and I thought Bruce was having a little too much fun doing so. His whole attitude that night said: \\"Yeah, your dad is my idol, and your little band is doing well right now, but for the moment why don't you stand right over there and LEARN.\\"<br /><br />Fast forward to 2007, where every music critic has been falling over him/herself to proclaim how bands like The Arcade Fire and The Hold Steady have been channeling their inner Springsteen to create Rock That Matters. Think Springsteen was paying attention? I would bet money on it.<br /><br />I think he went in the studio this year with that same attitude, one that said, \\"Oh, the Springsteen sound is hot, huh? Well then, welcome to my master class. I'll be your teacher for the next 12 tracks. Now sit down, take out your notebooks and #2 pencils, and begin taking notes. By the way, my name is The Boss.\\"<br /><br />I personally think the Arcade Fire sound more like John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band than Bruce Springsteen.  With Magic, I think Springsteen set out to ensure it. So while many tracks on Magic sound like they could be cut from Darkness On The Edge of Town or Born To Run, they definitely do not sound like outtakes from said records.<br /><br />I think this new album is more of a response to the indie kids than to anything going on in Iraq right now. He basically should have called this new album Springsteen 101.  Recommended.en was paying attention? I would bet money on it.

They are well-written, thoughtful, fit in well with the original stories (how Herbert and Andersen pulled that off I'll never know).  I'll never forget the day I heard Frank Herbert died...even though I didn't know him, I was truly saddened -- for selfish reasons: I thought there would be no more Dune.  Brian and Kevin are keeping him alive while giving us their own voice.  A rare ability.
B0009UC810|5.0|I agree that this 25th anniversary edition could be better, but it's a great print of a great film, with some extra footage from James Brown and other musical greats thrown in, so it's hard to complain.<br /><br />More than almost anything else he did, this movie shows why Belushi was a real star. The guy had presence to spare, and a real bond with Aykroyd, who wrote a great script with director Landis, who hit it out of the park with this one. No one was touting the soul survivors in those days, so the boys get big props for that as well. And what a band!<br /><br />It's hard to not love this movie. I saw it the week it opened, and it was a party in the theatre; wish that would happen again.<br />Time for us to loosen up, folks!
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I have heard this album several times now, and I must admit the first time I hated it.  It sounded jumbled, didn't really flow to me.  Then, the more I thought about it, what heroin junkie's mind really flows and makes sense?  So, I listened to it instead of hearing it, and got into the vocals and followed the story.  Methinks some people bought this album and were expecting Motley Crue, a bunch of \\"Shout at the Devil\\" stuff and were disappointed.  I bought it expecting that, and I was a little bit p***ed off.  It's not an angry album.  You'll hear songs like \\"Accidents Can Happen\\" and you're like \\"What the heck is this??\\".  Listening to it in its entirety, though, and you understand what he's trying to accomplish in the album.        I can tell you that if you want Motley Crue, look elsewhere.  If you want to hear a different side of Nikki Sixx's musical abilities and lyric writing, this is the perfect album for it.
B000002KXV|5.0|This came out in the fall of 1981; I still remember when and where I bought it, how it was snowing and I clutched it tight under my jacket lest it get wet (covers mattered back then!) and how often I played it, for months on end.<br /><br />It's an amazingly happy, upbeat album, and shows how much Fagen brought to the Dan table (ie most of what was great). IGY couldn't be sunnier, the lyrics in general are hilarious and touching, a rare combination, and The Goodbye Look is a classic track and should become a standard in years to come. Not a weak moment on this record; it does feel like the last real Steely Dan album in many ways, but less cynical and more hopeful. A lot of joy and release in these grooves! Its 1960-era themes seem deeply nostalgic at this point in history. When do WE get a New Frontier of our own?<br /><br />The Nightfly was one of the first digital pop records, if not the first; interestingly, when I worked for many bands in the 90s, like Floyd, Purple, Prance, Halen, etc, this album was used by the soundman to tweak the board about half the time, which is pretty amazing considering how many other cds are out there. Clearly this album is a cut above, sonically and musically.<br /><br />I must mention, for any fans of Steely Don and/or Dan, that an unbelievably perfect stereo soundboard from the Toronto show on 3/13/06 has just surfaced in the past few days on thetradersden and other tape trading sites. It sounds sooooo good, and the band is basically the latest Dan band minus Becker and plus Wayne Krantz, who was on the '96 Dan tour and is ten times the player that Becker is now; his uninspired noodling gone, the Dan tunes now sound twice as good, and Fagen's solo stuff sparkles. Make sure to get this tape! It's truly a classic show and will delight any fan. Pass it on to friends and keep the good vibes flowing.
159562015X|4.0|Whilst the questionnaire can provide you useful insights on what you do best, it is annoying that you have to buy the book to get the code for the on-line tests. There is little extra information in the book that doesn't come with the test results so they've missed a good opportunity to add value. A better approach would be to allow you to buy the tests on line and say get the book at a discount. Only having one shot at the test is also frustrating as I'd like to have another go or two but don't want to stump up the money for more books. If you're happy to pay for the book to do the test then you'll probably get some useful information to help with career planning and personal development.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|I liked this on the whole; when the script is good and the director wrote it, things often turn out well. LOW tries to be balanced and not too preachy; the rationalizations actually make some sense. The film downplays the political connections more than is likely true, though, I'd guess (destabilization of third world countries is one of the CIA's favorite tactics, as revealed by many ex-agents in many books, as is the Agency's drug-dealing as a method of both \\"insurgent\\" funding and arms trading, as revealed in the Iran/Contra hearings).<br /><br />My main qualm is with Cage, who somehow always seems to invest his characters with less brains and savvy than they deserve. It worked great in Raising Arizona but is wearing thin since then. He's kind of like the unthinking man's James Caan. Cage comes so close sometimes, but I just can't buy him all the way. Here he is solid but never transcends and takes this movie to the next level.<br /><br />Leto is good, as are most of the bit players, especially some of the Africans, who have more presence than some of the stars.<br />LOW does get pretty violent. The violence rarely seems gratuitous, though, so its point gets made.<br />Worth seeing.
1400082773|5.0|As my readers will know, I am a tough critic, but I can find precious little about \\"Dreams from my Father\\" to criticize.  Of course, the book will not appeal to those who don't care about race in America, or who have extremely fixed ideas about the subject.  I like to think though that the majority of the reading public at least (if not the general public) are both engaged with and to some extent open-minded about our nation's central bugaboo/crisis/character flaw.      An editorial review mentioned that Obama's mother is almost absent from the book.  To some extent he may have taken her somewhat for granted -- unlike his father or himself, he always had a good idea who she was and what she was about.  In the preface to this edition, Obama mentions that she has died of cancer between the original publication and his nomination for U. S. Senate from Illinois, and that if he had known she would not be around to see that, he might have written a different book, spending more time hailing her for having stood by him.  In the introduction to the first edition (written in 1995), he admits that he can't speak for everyone in the world.  This is the most ironic part of the book, since it was only a year after that that he first ran for the Illinois state legislature.  Thereafter, he has increasingly been compelled to try to do just that.    Although finding oneself has become a cliche, especially in the literary world, it was Barack Obama's mission for the first thirty years of his life.  Defined as a black man, he sought to make his race more than a social construct, but something central and ineffable, and at the same time not cut off his ties to the rest of humanity, particularly his white mother and grandparents.  He doesn't take his mother completely for granted -- he spends thirty to fifty pages talking about her background and that of her parents, who moved from Kansas to Hawaii, seeing it as the last frontier, when she was about to start college.  Another one hundred pages or so explore his life with them in Hawaii (with a short stint in Indonesia, where his mother married a man who had studied in America and gave birth to Obama's half-sister Maya).      Readers of any race will be overwhelmed by the sheer power of Obama's writing.  I choked up reading this several times.  That is ultimately the best reason to read it, not the fact that Barack Obama has become a serious candidate for the presidency.  This book also helps you figure out how he did that.  The only thing he feels more keenly than his own hopes and fears are the hopes and fears of everyone around him.  At the end of the book, having learned the whole story of his father's and grandfather's lives, he stands over their graves and weeps, feeling what they must have felt at each turning point of their lives.  Although Obama is quintessentially American, I somehow would not be surprised, given the epiphany he had there, if he chose upon his death to be buried in Kenya alongside them.  But perhaps my sympathy is making me romanticize the man.    This book leaves me with two regrets and one big hope.  First, it is probably unfilmable.  Second, there is one man running with even more vision and courage than Barack Obama, so I won't be able to vote for him in the primary election (although I will in the general if he is the candidate).  My big hope is that Obama will write a third book in 2017, having waited eleven years between books as he did between his first and second, that will combine the autobiography he did with this book and the political manifesto he did with \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" (a phrase which you have to read \\"Dreams from my Father\\" to know Obama doesn't take credit for).  Although I haven't finished the latter book, there is basically no way it could top this one.  I give it my highest recommendation.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Since theres already 102 other revies, this will be brief and to the point. All the songs are extremly hard and fast. The last three songs are demos that are crap, but their interesting to listen to and see how far the actual recording has come. My broblem is with \\"these boots\\" being bleeped out. Some think its funny, but it pisses me off to have a good song ruined. If it wasnt for the bleeping out, this would be 5/5 stars.
0307237699|4.0|I routinely give history books five stars, but I am compelled to limit this one to four.  The political manifesto is limited as a genre, and I was not quite ready after Obama's last book to be brought back down to earth.  The stories in this book, while by turns sad and funny, are no longer told for their own sakes like the ones in \\"Dreams from my Father,\\" but to illustrate a point.  Still, Obama manages to be polemical without being strident.  When they deserve it in his view, he bestows credit and even praise on individual Republicans, and quotes the sage advice that President Bush once gave him -- that he was rising so spectacularly that people on his own side might come to see him as a threat.  He also has a lot of praise for his staff members, listing the more senior ones by name and telling stories of things he and they discovered at the same time.    The leading characteristic of this book is that Obama strives to be Informed about every issue he comments on.  Accordingly, he attacks those on the extreme poles of the debate on all these issues for encouraging their constituents not to be informed.  He will frequently say, in so many words, that while Republicans need to acknowledge X, Democrats equally need to acknowledge Y.  The eighth chapter, \\"The World Beyond Our Borders,\\" indicates even if his more recent rhetoric did not that if you are looking for a candidate who will get our troops out of Iraq quickly, Barack Obama is probably not your man.  He reminds me of no one, in fact, so much as Bill Clinton in his knowledgeable approach to the issues, bolstered frequently by statistics.    My favorite chapters were the third chapter -- in which Obama sets forth his view of the Constitution, and talks of his respectful meeting with onetime Klansman Sen. Robert Byrd -- and the sixth chapter, where he talks about religion and his race against Alan Keyes (having discussed most of his other political opponents in the previous four chapters).  While he beat Keyes handily, Keyes made him more uncomfortable than the others for his implicit charge that Obama's faith is insincere or \\"adulterated,\\" the word Obama uses.  From this chapter, however, I gleaned that Obama's faith is hard-won.  He had higher expectations of religion perhaps than most, a higher threshhold that he insisted it meet before he would embrace it; but he is sincere.  Keyes has now entered the Presidential race (his third try for his party's nomination); I suspect that more than anything he wants another crack at Obama.  In the last chapter before the epilogue, we see Obama as a family man, a side of him which didn't make it into his first book.    Obama writes far more readable and entertaining books than the Clintons do -- which doesn't necessarily mean he would make a better President than either of them.  But I am glad he exists.  He is one of those singular people who seek to prove we as a nation are who we say we are.  If I was teaching American history in an inner-city school, and was not compelled to use the same books as everyone else in the state, Obama would be one of five or so authors I would assign.  (Did I mention his insights on the need to completely restructure public education, shared in the fifth chapter, \\"Opportunity\\"?  He's a bit short on details of his solution here, however.)  As mentioned above, I give this book four stars.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is easily one of the best shows on TV, but not for the faint of stomach. Dexter Morgan is a blood spatter analyst for the Miami crime lab who moonlights as a special kind of serial killer. Dexter pursues his real passion (killing) while still trying to fit in with the real world,   including managing personal relationships that he's not capable of understanding. The show has suspense, tension, pathos, and a lot of dark humor. The writing in this is fantastic, the acting, especially by Michael C. Hall, is first-rate, and the first season's held together by a great plot line. But, if blood spatter, gore, and a lot of moral ambiguity is a turnoff, this isn't the show for you.
0307276902|5.0|This book was incredible. I loved every page of it. I like how Frey presented the stories, the experiences, etc. It made me sob, think, laugh, ponder, cringe, and embrace the journey of the book. Get over the controversy and let yourself become addicted to the writing of Frey.
B000M3452Y|4.0|I ran into a friend in a bar recently who insisted on playing \\"North American Scum\\" to me on his Ipod; as he thought it was so amazing.  I liked the track a lot but couldn't quite figure out why it sounded so familiar until he pointed out that it sounded exactly like Pete Shelley's 1981 hit \\"Homosapien\\".  It isn't like \\"Homosapien\\"; it is a total rip off.  That doesn't mean it's not a lot of fun to listen to though.  Welcome to post-modernism 2.0.     LCD trade in nostalgia, it's simply what they do.  For the first part of their career the blueprint was Public Image Limited and to a lesser extent the Fall; but now they've expanded their horizons to mine a larger field of 80's innovators and they do it with overall really strong (sometimes amazing) results.  Opening track \\"Get Innocuous\\" is Berlin Bowie meets Kraftwerk in such an obvious way you almost want to cringe.  And yet by the end of this tune I was absolutely sold on the track.  They just do it so damn well I found it impossible to resist.    There are other highlights.  \\"Someone Great\\" is the best track the Human League never made.  It's wonderful.  \\"All My Friends\\" is daring and amazing.  It also features the best lyrics I have heard in a long, long time.  It also has the punk rock ability to send people running out of the room with its repeating piano figure.  I later played this record at a cocktail party and it utterly polarized everyone in the room.  Mission accomplished.    The album has two general themes; the first, that NYC is tired and overrated; and the second the challenges of encroaching age.  These may not be the most fun themes for a pop record but exploring them does justice to the band's influences.      A great effort.  That rare thing: The sophomore improvement.  LCD Soundsystem didn't get there first, but they got there.
0743455967|5.0|The book can be broken into two sections, an autobiographical section and Stephen King's thoughts and tips on what is important for good writing.    The autobiographical part is limited to the parts of his life that he feels shaped and influenced him as a writer. Interesting and relevant though it is, this section really plays second fiddle to the other, which contains gems of his knowledge right from the first few lines. While reading the first section, I found myself constantly wanting to get through it to get to the second section.    That section, On Writing, I found instantly more useful than any other single source of writing tips or advice.    King begins with grammar and a few of his pet peeves before progressing to the more subtle points of quality writing and then to editing your own work. It is by no means an A-Z, all encompassing encyclopedia of how to be a writer, but what he does provide is what he thinks are relavent, useful pointers on how to improve. Here he completely succeeds. What he says makes perfect sense, and gives the reader actual tools that can be put into place immediately.     He does not beat around the bush and add in superfluous material in order to make the book seem more complete, which adds to the reader's confidence (as if there should ever have been a doubt) that what King has written is truly worth taking in.    King has a no-nonsense approach to writing, and I found myself laughing at regular attacks on sub-par writing or examples of writer commitment. He comes down heavy anyone who might think they have a god-given talent to write well without putting in the work. Writing, for him, is a part of everyday life and he believes that for any true writer it must be that way.    Overall, I found the book to be not only a very useful reference, but an inspiring account of what it takes to succeed as a writer.
B000TSIK14|5.0|Awesome record, a lot of heavy detuned guitars, intelligent lyrics, catchy choruses and some great riffs, recommended!!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I'm not sure what all the buzz about the word 'remastered' is ... other then sounds good to move product. This is the CD that changed my mind entirely about the word 'remastered.' It certainly lost something on many of the tracks. At times it is 'brittle ... harsh ... and even 'flat sounding' in the sense of the 'attacks' are almost completely washed out. There's no comparison between these 'remasters' and the \\"Love\\" CD that George and Giles Martin did. (George Martin also oversaw the remastering of the Yellow Submarine CD that came out a few years ago.) Personally, this CD was a big disappointment. Some like it - but I'd recommend you listen for yourself first. (They could have done much better - and should have.)

0060555661|5.0|This is basically Graham's original book with commentaries by Zweig who tries to make the book more enjoyable by relating it to the stock market in the late 90's. There are numerous commentaries and footnotes in Graham's chapters. In addition every other chapter is one written by Zweig. Overall, Zweig adds value by making Graham's original book more readable.    Ben Graham's writings (who was Warren Buffett's, arguably the world's greatest investor, teacher) are absolutely essential for any serious investor. Whether you agree or disagree with his views, as an investor in the stock market one needs to be familiar with Graham's theories and thoughts. I think that this book only adds to Graham's original book. If you are annoyed by Zweig (which I wasn't) you could always skip the chapters by him. Some have said that the commentaries are hard to ignore, but I believe overall Zweig does an excellent job applying Graham's teachings to the current situation in the market.    I usually pass my books to others but I plan to keep this one forever in my refernce library.
B000T17ZYO|4.0|A close look at the picture will tell you that this is not \\"Strange Days\\" as is inaccurately advertised but is indeed the debut self-titled Doors album.  This version of this great seminal album that introduced the Doors to the world comes in a mini-lp sleeve replica that is well designed and is remastered by the original producer, Bruce Botnick.  However, the volume levels are a lot lower than the previous German mlps version although Botnick assures us in the liner notes that this is how the album was originally intended to sound and so who am I to contradict him!  This version also includes a 22-page booklet which include not only the Botnick liner notes but also all the lyrics in English and Japanese as well as 3 bonus tracks consisting of 2 versions of \\"Moonlight Drive\\" and \\"Indian Summer\\".  Only \\"L.A. Woman\\" comes close to matching the brilliance of this album. No weak tracks here and the great \\"The End\\", \\"Light My Fire\\" and \\"Break On Through\\" are here. This album is a must have in any serious music collector's library only be sure to turn the volume up to get maximum benefits. Highly recommended.
0195067142|5.0|I watched much of The War this weekend on PBS. Ken Burns leans heavily on Eugene Sledge's account of war, and that tells me that Burns at least knows genius writing when he reads it.<br /><br />Sledge may be the best writer from the 20th century that most people have never heard of. His language is harrowing and detailed and does not spare any details about the chaos and misery and ineffable singular experience that is war. I truly believe that he lived through Peleliu and Okinawa, so he could compile his writings and share them with the world. How else can you explain the same person living through two of the nastiest battles of the 20th century?<br /><br />Buy this book. Share it with everyone you know.
0553805460|1.0|Did anyone else lose count of how many times Mr. Belfort used the phrase \\"luscious loamy loins\\" in this book?  The Duchess must have had some interesting private parts if they were indeed \\"loamy\\".  Hmm.    This memoir is not worth reading unless you were an employee of Stratton Oakmont or had some kind of connection to the people mentioned in it.  The book is mostly about Jordan's careless spending, complete disregard for others, and raging drug and prostitute habits.  You don't even get the sense that he's remorseful about any of it in the end:  it rather seems that Mr. Belfort is boasting about his bad behavior.     The beginning of the book details the rise of Jordan in the broker business and does have some interesting chapters.  Then it takes a nose dive and turns into an ego trip down Mr. Belfort's memory lane.  It gets painfully boring and quite unbelievable at points:  Jordan describes miracle medical cures, his superhuman resistance to deadly doses of various drugs, ridiculous tawdry conversations...  It's full of way-out-there stuff that makes you think maybe Jordan imagined these things in his drug-addled mind.  Even if some of it is true, it's not very interesting and mostly I just felt embarassed for him and the people whose nasty habits he reveals in this tale.    Save your money, Jordan is a conceited bore.
B000BYRCH4|5.0|So this is not a movie with character actors. So what?    I declared this \\"the last summer movie\\" when we watched it last weekend (sometimes still hot in Boulder in October :-)).     Here is why I think it succeeds in being a summer feel-good movie:  - Gorgeous actors (I think Paul and Jessica beat Brad and Angelina)  - Breathtaking scenery (over and under water)  - Adventure story line  - Plenty of action (not too gory)  - Plenty of surprises  - Gives you pointers to rethink your priorities (e.g. love vs. money)    I think the acting was actually decent. I definitely believed the main character's emotions and statements, and nothing seemed forced or unnatural. If you take if for what it is, which is an entertaining adventure movie in a tropical setting, you shouldn't be going wrong with it.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|I still remember as a child reading about Peter Rabbit and relating to his disobedient explorations of Mr. McGregor's garden. The pictures were charming, the story easy to follow. It was entertainment, with a moral thrown into the...uh, rabbit stew.<br /><br />Renee Zellweger does a fine job of bringing to life the author's story. \\"Miss Potter\\" was a cutting-edge woman in the early 1900s, bucking the trend of settling down into a proper, upper-class marriage, turning instead to the dream of drawing and writing. Her seemingly childish endeavors made her an extremely wealthy woman, with her books becoming some of the bestselling children's stories of all time.<br /><br />The story centers around Beatrix Potter's personal goals as an artist, and around her romantic notions with her publisher. Both of these pursuits clash with her parents' wishes for her, and it becomes a movie of female independence and strength, yet in a family-friendly and sweet way. It's not without tragedy. It's also laced with humor and subtle environmental comments, based upon Miss Potter's actual expenditures which saved 4000 acres of farm land in England's Lake District.<br /><br />I found the movie enjoyable in every aspect--great acting, wonderful music, nicely incorporated animation, and inspiration for all who dream.

B00005JN0T|3.0|The year is 2035. Detective Del Spooner is investigating the death of an  eccentric scientist named Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner is aided by psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin.  Dr. Lanning's death is initially labeled a suicide. Spooner, however, suspects that a robot may be responsible for the death of the good doctor. This seems unthinkable since robots are governed by \\"The Three Laws of Robotics\\":  a robot may never harm or allow harm to come to a human being. As Spooner and Calvin investigate the death, they come to believe that a robot did commit the crime. They are aided in their investigation by Dr. Lanning himself, who appears as a hologram, and reveals that he was working on a top secret project at the time of his death.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|If you own pets, absolutely positively do not waste your money buying this.  They claim it picks up long hair and fur.  Well yeah, but then you spend much time trying to disengage the fur from the wheels and the brush portions.  By the time I get enough fur pulled off to make the wheels work again, I could've saved myself a lot of time and effort just getting out a real vacuum that actually has suction power.  I was going out of my way to try to pick up the fur by hand, before using the sweeper, and just wanted to at least pick up crumbs/dirt.  It has to be recharged each time it's used, so I have to think ahead to use it.  Of course, now I don't bother.  My mother was so excited when she first got hers, she sold several of us on this item.  I have found that due to battery problems, theirs have all been sent to the trash, too.  If I had to do all over, I would not waste money on this product.  (And, as most people only  like this item for a short time, you wouldn't  want to buy a \\"used\\" one, although I'm sure a lot of us would love to sell you ours!)  It isn't worth even one star.

B000ICL3KG|4.0|I will not discuss the details, particularly the scientific details and methods. There are a few things that are not entirely acceptable. For one and only instance he manipulates facts when he pretends no scientific voice has spoken in doubt of the global warming theory. Richard Lindzen who is an important climatologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has widely and wildly spoken against it. But he is true on one fact. There is no reason to do something that could be harmful in a way or another and that we can avoid. Going against pollution and carbon mono- and dioxide emission is ethically good because there is no reason why we should pollute and emit carbon mono- and dioxides unnecessarily. This is also economically wise because there is no reason why we should produce waste since then waste-processing is an economic cost that will cripple the economy in a very short period of time. He is also right on another thing. It is a political issue and it has to be dealt with as such. But the film is not even a documentary. It lacks several elements to be one. For one it does not provide an opportunity to anyone to speak: it is a monologue. For two it does not provide an opportunity to anyone to dissent with the only point of view that is defended here. In other words it is perfect propaganda, advertising, and nothing else. Even worse, the term of truth is irritating to the utmost. We are not looking for truth because truth does not exist. There are only points of view. So we have to convince people and to do so we have to be balanced and listen to other points of view and not to impose one point of view by unilaterally calling it truth. And anyway when that truth becomes A truth that means there are more than one, but then they are not truth, they are points of view. The same remark goes for the direct quotation of the Book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. Any apocalyptic vision is to be rejected if we want to work on the reason of people and not on their fear. Any ethical decision is ethical only if it is based on conviction and not on fear. Al Gore, in a nice tone, with a cool intonation, spreads fear with even some symbolical elements like the Twin Towers Memorial being underwater if his apocalyptic prediction turns true. At least that is what Milton taught me three centuries ago. Even worse again. How dare he quote Winston Churchill speaking of Hitler and Nazism to speak of climate change and the apocalypse he is announcing? That is gross, un-respectful of the people who fought against Hitler who was not a simple tornado and was slightly more systematic in his apocalyptic bulldozing of the world than a hurricane would be. Bad taste indeed. His knowledge of history is also particularly warped. He attributes all positive elements to the US, including the French Revolution - who was a great blood bath by the way - but he forgets to attribute the two atomic mushrooms that ever exploded over a city to the United States in violation of the Yalta agreement: then he becomes general and the fault is nicely laid down on the threshold of humanity in general. It is also by far too personal, nearly a life story, and definitely the political allusions about recent presidential elections and other events are out of place in a documentary on climate change, and it destroys some more the ambition of this film to be a documentary.

The action scenes were outstanding, the CGI work was flawless and Nick cage who I'm not crazy about did a good job. What sealed it for me was the usage of the Biblical madman Legion who was possessed by over a 1000 demons.  The movie is great to show off 1080p to any non believer in hi def, and once the action starts you'll be hooked take my word for it. Highly recommended
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Have listened to this cd several times, hard to find one that I like better than the rest, but it took me the second listening to like all of them.  You know that he has something to say about the war and the USA involvment, but like him, you have to make up your own mind about it.  Maybe to much politics in music?? Difficult to say.  At least you know that he is very much aware of what is happening in our country.  Most celeb.s are so self involved they have no idea of what is going on outside their own environment.  He is still the Boss and I love his music and band for being who they are.  Good music all the way.

I'm writing this to hopefully open some ears and eyes as to what is going on in popular music, and the trend of making every product \\"Louder\\" than everything that came before it    My gripe is a very, very important one. When a band spends around $750k making an album, one would think that they'd make sure it \\"sounded\\" absolutely amazing before it was released. Well, somebody messed up here. Over my dead body would I have let this version of the album leave the pressing plant if I spent that kind of money on my art.    The Loudness Wars are still raging, and not even Nightwish (who seem to care so much about their art) are safe from the fallout.    The sound of these songs is tragic. The problem lies in hard limiting/clipping of the program material. The volume is maximized to where there are only 3 dynamic variations on this album; The quiet/delicate parts (Loud), the breakdowns/buildups (Very Loud, and everything else (Extremely Loud). These last 2 dynamic variations (Very Loud, and Extremely Loud) are both hard limited to where it sounds like 2-3dbs of sound was chopped off, and the waveforms are flat lined. Basically, when you listen to this album, you are going to get bombarded with a wall full of sound with no room to breath, which sounds at times like its choking under its own weight. Because of the extreme loudness maximizing, distortion artifacts are introduced all over the place, and it really taints the sound. It's really noticeable on the transient attacks of some of the instruments...especially the \\"Drums\\", which also sound tiny and small throughout the album due to the hard compression/distortion.    When something is supposed to go \\"Boom\\" it goes \\"Thud\\". When the orchestra is supposed to explode, it sounds like it is literally hitting a brick wall.  Instead of a \\"punchy\\" and \\"lively\\" mix, we get an album that is slammed to the wall, and crushedto death. It makes for a fatiguing and tough listen. I feel like the music has been scarred and disrespected.     I couldn't believe it, and thought my ears were deceiving me, until I stuck the songs into a sound spectrum analyzer and saw the horror. 90% of the music is slammed at -0.19db with again, about 3db's of the sound chopped off, and around 0.5 db's (if that) of dynamic variance. It's disgusting.    I love this album, but it is very tough to listen to all the way through. I want a re-master with little or no limiting/clipping/over compression... I know how to turn up the volume knob. :-/     Wow... This is one of the worst examples of volume maximization killing music, Ive heard, and cant believe it has happened to this awesome album. I thought it went as far as it could go in the very recent past. Guess I was wrong. When will they learn.... *shakes head*
B0006GAI6Y|1.0|Where to begin, where to begin.  First of all, this is not a Jennifer Lopez vehicle for any of you who think this is going to be another `Maid in Manhattan' or something of the sort.  Jennifer's role is very small indeed and she hardly shines here.  Jennifer Lopez is far from a great actress and she appears in far from great movies, but she has always been able to bring enough charm to her roles that her movies become enjoyable in their simplicity.  Movies like `Maid in Manhattan' and `The Wedding Planner' are delightful despite their lack of real flare.  Here though, with the film out of her hands so-to-speak she has no real chance of salvaging the wreckage, and what few scenes she does inhabit show no signs of her even trying.<br /><br />The film follows John Clark, a middle aged business man who is apparently unhappy with his perfect life and so he decides to change things up by secretly attending ballroom dancing classes at a local studio.  He soon finds that his business partner Link is also a secret dancer who hides his passion behind fake enthusiasm for sports like football.  John's wife Beverly suspects John is having an affair with him working late and in better moods and so she hires a private detective to investigate only to uncover that her husband is dancing and is going to enter a competition.<br /><br />The problem for me with `Shall We Dance' is that it is ultimately a pointless film with no real redeemable factors, aside from Stanley Tucci's hilarious if not over the top performance (I'm sorry but the whole wig thing had me in stitches).  To me the whole midlife crisis thing was just a ploy to try and make this slush legit, which it doesn't.  The performances are less than average really.  Richard Gere is far from charming and his character is quite the bore.  Susan Sarandon, a goddess on the screen, is wasted here.  I'm still baffled she agreed to do this film.  Lopez, as I said, is horrible here.  Lisa Ann Walter is funny to a degree as the obnoxious Bobbie, but even her antics coupled with Tucci aren't enough to make even one viewing of this film worthwhile.  It's not very often I find a film so utterly wasted, but this is one that I wish I had never wasted my time to witness and one I surely will never watch again.but even her antics coupled with Tucci aren't enough to make even one viewing of this film worthwhile.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|The album is better from tracks 8-11 with noteworthy mention of \\"Last to Die\\" and \\"Long Walk Home\\", but the rest of the album sounds computer generated; overly repititioons and with melodies that high school bands could have probably come up with. Most of these songs are below Springsteen's typical capability (with the exception of the Rising) and if it wasn't for the E-street band and clever mixing it would sound even worse than it does. With the additional releases this year and last of a live, remasted and a cover album, perhaps Springsteen and the recording label are really only looking to generate income even if at the expense of musical talent.     Perhaps one reason for the outstanding reviews is that Springsteen is becoming ever more alone in his 80's style rock phenomenon with little in comparison.
B00006FDCD|4.0|No one believed the children of a small town when they said a clown was killing them off one by one. This movie makes you want to believe everytime a kid says their is a monster under my bed, in the closet or in the pipes. IT is the movie that started out my fear of clowns. So my advice is to advoid this movie if you are easily scared.   ~v
1592332803|5.0|I just received my copy of The Joy of Vegan Baking, and it's a wonderful cookbook!  Lovely color pictures, awesome recipes, and lots of helpful information.  I made the Mexican Wedding Cookies first, and they were totally delish.  Just like I remembered from my pre-vegan days.  They were easy to make and they melt in your mouth!  Can't wait to bake some more goodies!  Now we can eat our sweets and feel good that no animals have been harmed in the making of these baked goods!  Thanks, Colleen, we needed this cookbook!
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice  (Jennifer Ehle, Colin Firth, David Bamber, Crispin Bonham-Carter, Anthony Calf, Anna Chancellor, Susannah Harker, Julia Sawalha, Alison Steadman, Benjamin Whitrow) is utterly absorbing.  Thirty minutes into the film and 190 years melt away with the audience joining Austen's culture that is full obstacles and arcane social rules. Extraordinary acting enlivens this version, making it second only to the book itself. I own the DVD set and have uncharacteristically watched numerous times because of its enchanting power.  The setting is you-are-there perfect from broad swaths of countryside to minute details of household bric-a-brac. The cameras artfully capture the superb, nuanced acting as the extraordinary cast embody Austen's characters. Readers of Austen will appreciate the efforts of the entire production staff as the exquisite, exacting details of architecture, decor, fabrics, clothing, voices and habits will enrich the imagination for all future reading.
B000RJO578|5.0|Hot Fuzz is as much fun as I've had in a movie theatre all year.  A send-up of American action movies, particularly those made by noted hack Michael Bay, Hot Fuzz achieves what Bay's films could only imagine, they're both awesome and entertaining. This is one of the few films where your side hurts from laughing, but you have to stop clutching it, to cover your eyes from sudden explosions of gore or brutality. Filled with scene stealing performances, from Jim Broadbent as the chief, to Timothy Dalton as a diabolical supermarket supervisor, Hot Fuzz is easily the best comedy and action film of the year so far, and shouldn't be missed.
B000O599ZS|5.0|Another Classic from Wayne. Great portrayal of one of many former Confederates who alone, or with their units, never surrendered at the end of the War Between the States and in July 1865 crossed the Rio Grande into what then was the Second Mexican Empire. After the fall of that empire in 1868 a number of confederate veterans returned home only to find their homes under a hard occupation by US troops or under constant indian threat, as was the case in west Texas. You relive those times when watching this film. Its one that you can watch more than once.
B000059QY2|5.0|Never mind if it is not a stage production but a film.<br />It is tons more dramatic and entertaining than 'Romeo and Juliet' starring Leaonard Whiting and others, though the setting is almost the same. The reason? The music, of course.<br />Even if Pav was never a skilful actor on stage, in this film he portrayed a very convincing Duke of Mantua. Edita Gruberova's Gilda is heart-wrenchingly sung and portrayed. All the rest of the cast is great - Ferrucio Furlanetto, then so young and slim as to escape notice visually, is a real vocal discovery. And his acting is also very coherent with his singing.<br />The only slight weakness that could be picked lies in the title role - this jester is hardly funny, full of serious mentality and schemy political sense. The unanimously stenturion singing style of Wixell may not fit the role of the cursed jester as well as the cursing Count.<br />Otherwise, there really is nothing to flaw this spectacular production, showing Pavarotti in his prime PLUS good acting skills as a rare bonus!
0440234743|5.0|I found this book to be interesting because it dealt with a contested will.  The man who died was very rich but wanted to make sure his ex-wives and children who weren't nice people didn't get their hands on it.

B000002HNR|4.0|The Doors' live performances are, of course, legendary. I have found that this is more for Morrison's antics - inciting riots, indecently exposing himself, etc, then the music. But the music itself is pretty good, displaying the Doors as a loose blues band - much like on LP's such as Morrison Hotel and L.A. Woman. If nothing else, fans should have this for the amount of otherwise hard-to-get material, including the worthwhile blues \\"Close to You\\" and the moody psychedelia of \\"Universal Mind\\", which quotes \\"My Favorite Things\\". There is also an electrifying performance of \\"Break on Through\\" - along with an even more intense \\"Five to One\\" and the lengthy finale \\"Soul Kitchen\\", it's the only real hit they play. Don't be fooled by the \\"No. 2\\" subtitle (which I believe was applied because \\"Dead Cats, Dead Rats\\" uses the organ part) and the fact that it's about twice as long as the studio version, it's still \\"Break on Through\\". As for the blues songs, they rule: a funky \\"Who Do You Love?\\", a menacing \\"Back Door Man\\". But the real reason to get this is for the infamous \\"Celebration of the Lizard\\", that sidelong beat poetry reading-meets-jam pitched for Waiting for the Sun that Jim couldn't pull off in the studio because of his alcohol problems. I think it's one of their finest achievements myself: Jim's dark, disturbing lyrics are his best of the kind since \\"The End\\", and the group adds several layers of mysterious intrigue to it with Manzarek's moody organ and Densmore's tribal drumming matching Jim's dramatic intonations. Plus the dynamic shifts add a lot of power. Of course, if you hate the Doors, this will fuel the fire. The big downside is an interminable \\"When the Music's Over\\" that goes from a lengthy, kinetic groove on the studio version (one of their best, by the way) to total bombast that's just an excuse for Jim to scream his head off; there are other fillers such as a brief \\"Whiskey Bar\\", but they're no big deal. If you ask me, any Doors fan should have this one. It's pretty high up there.e. It's pretty high up there.

B00004SZWD|5.0|Like listening to a career greatest hits CD. With so many familiar tunes like \\"Isn't She Lovely\\", \\"As\\", \\"Sir Duke\\", \\"Love's In Need Of Love Today\\", \\"Village Ghetto Land\\", this was Stevie at his creative best. A two disc classic consistently rated amongst the best recordings of all time. No Stevie Wonder disc collection is anywhere near complete without this multi Grammy winner of 1976.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|Yes, some \\"Magic\\" can be found on this cd but unfortunately that famous E-Street Band sound has been turned into a wall of mush. Bruce's vocals at times seem to be uninspired and somewhat forced and I wish it weren't so because I am a decades long Jersey fan. This cd is worth hearing but I'll be playing \\"The River\\" when I need my E-Street fix.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes Rock and they know it. They also don't care what you or I or anyone else thinks. This is what makes them so cool. Jack and Meg are free of all of the pretentions that make most artisits so impressed with themselves. The Stripes simply make the musc that they, themselves want to hear, and invite you over to hang out, have a few beers and experience the vibe. Icky Thump, the title track is a perfect example of what freedom from judgement can provide - its rockin', trippy, and full of primitive attitude. The slight artsy pretense that encumbered Get Behind Me Satan is nowhere to be found on outstanding tracks like Rag and Bone and Catch Hell Blues. Now, Jack and Meg are just simply cooler than the rest of the modern rock bands. and they know it. and that's damn cool in and of itself.
B000R7HY0K|3.0|I viewed this movie as GRINDHOUSE in the movie theater when it was released. I decided then that this movie, along with Terror Planet and the cool cheezy fake promos, was so BIG, BAD and LOUD that it truly needs to be seen in the movie theater where the darkened room, huge screen and blistering sound, as well the lack of being interrupted by the phone (or whatever other distraction) brings you right into the scene.  The film is WAY over-the-top with the action sequences. Truly a great homage to the movie theater experience of grindhouse.    Unless you have a REALLY big-screen TV or projection screen and thunderous loud audio, this film just won't suffice in bringing the BIG BAD and LOUD experience to you.    Also, the ommision of the cheezy, over-the-top fake promos takes cred (and a couple of stars) away from the whole DVD release. I'm not so unhappy that Planet Terror was not included in this release. They are two different - albeit whacked - films which most viewers at home wouldn't likely view together for 3 hours anyway. I liked Death Proof more than Planet Terror, although Terror would be a better Halloween view, even on a regular home TV.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Billy Corgan is a great guitar player, and if you can stand his sometimes whiny vocals, you will definitely enjoy this record. Unlike most of the smoke and mirror playing of many modern rock guitarists, BC is highly skilled in the school of 70s hard rockers, late 60's psychedelic players, and 80's shredders. this extensive guitar vocabulary is on glorious disply throughout the cd, and especially on standouts Tarantula, and Bleeding the Orchid. It's angry, creepy, trippy and rockin' all at the same time. I will also admit that I forgot what a capable drummer Jimmy Chamberlain is. Solid cd.
B000H0MKGK|3.0|Nice album overall.  However, it still fits into the category of possible \\"one hit wonder\\".....maybe next time ?
B000LC3ID8|2.0|Not the best to come out of the Saw line.  It does wrap up some questions in the plot, but the gore is over the top, which is naturally for effect.  I hope the final installment goes back to the roots with a decent plot and skill in the game of puzzles.
B000URDEB0|5.0|Dark Passion Play is a release that won't soon be forgotten.  There is so much history behind this release that it isn't easy to review this album without going into great detail, so be prepared for a long read. It is my supreme hope that this review will be helpful to everyone.  I hope that old school Nightwish fans (like myself) will read this and understand that Nightwish has taken a new direction in their music, and that it isn't a bad one.  I hope that new listeners will read this and become Nightwish fans like the opportunity that was given to me many years ago.<br /><br />Regarding the death and rebirth of Nightwish: Everyone thought Nightwish was dead after they fired Tarja in 2005.  I held out hope they weren't dead, after all, Tuomas is the genius behind the band, and he is still there.  \\"As long as Tuomas was writing the songs, they would survive, no matter who the singer is.\\" I thought to myself.  Normally changing the singer in a band has one of three effects: 1) the band survives but becomes forgotten, 2) the band dies, or 3) the band adapts and flourishes.  There are very few bands who can survive the change of a main vocalist and do well afterwards.  I had been a Sentenced fan for a while and in 1996 they replaced the singer, instead of killing the band, they changed slightly to accommodate the new singer and carried on for nine more years before calling it quits on a high note.  Sentenced survived the lead-singer change-out because they were smart, Nightwish can do the same.  Dark Passion Play is a start, and in the next album you will hear that their sound will become more refined to meet with Anette's singing style (all the music was written for DPP before Anette was even in the band).  This upcoming change in Nightwish, if done correctly, will allow the band to expand as they haven't ever before.  With the addition of  Anette, Nightwish has become reborn into something that can not be ignored and will influence a generation of musicians to come.<br /><br />Regarding Tarja and Anette:  The first thing you'll note about this album is that Anette isn't Tarja.  She has a totally different singing style and look than Tarja did, and it fits the band extremely well.  Not comparing the two will not happen as this is a band that was crafted to Tarja's voice.  In fact, if it wasn't for Tarja's voice, they wouldn't have become a metal act according to Tuomas.  That was 10 years ago, however, and times have changed.<br /><br />Regarding Artwork:  Dark Passion Play very much follows it's art/packaging in the same vein as Wishmaster.  The booklet contains full lyrics to all songs on the disc as well as a picture that goes along with each song.  I would love to be able to buy some posters with these images, as they each convey the feel of the songs very well, and are incredibly beautiful artworks as is.<br /><br />Regarding the announcement of the new album: When I heard that this CD was to open with a 14-minute epic I couldn't believe my ears.  For one thing, it's a hell of a bold move to open a CD with a 14 minute song.  Normally they are drawn out and somewhat boring and get skipped to the next track half way though.  However, I was also excited.  I remember when I first heard Dead Boys Poem I was completely blown away, and I still never tire of the haunting riffs in that song.  Then there was Ghost Love Score clocking in at 10 minutes, GLS was truly an epic song which I love to this day.  Little did I know that both of those songs were about to be outdone..<br /><br />1) The Poet and the Pendulum:<br />I had high hopes for The Poet and the Pendulum and I'm glad to say that I wasn't disappointed. It's split into five different parts, each with its own distinct feel and theme; because of this it's hard to write a small review for this song, so I will go into detail here.<br />\\"White Lands of Empathica\\" has a very somber feeling to it as it leads into \\"Home\\" which explodes into an orchestral metal fiasco.<br />\\"Home\\" isthe first time you hear Anette on this CD and she sounds great.  The chorus in this song is played twice in \\"Home\\" and it's something that isn't soon forgotten. I can't help but scream along with the song during the chorus, it's amazing.<br />\\"The Pacific\\" is another heavy part of this score that winds down into a quiet more soft tone where we hear a young boy's spoken word (think Dead Boy's Poem) which leads into \\"Dark Passion Play\\".<br />\\"Dark Passion Play\\" is arguably the heaviest part of the song in which Anette and Marco go into a fierce battle of words. Once again the song is interrupted by the boy's spoken word.  This time, the spoken word is angrier and ends with a sharp 'SAVE ME' and the sharp sound of what I describe as a cutting scythe.<br />\\"Mother & Father\\" is the final part of The Poet and the Pendulum and the tone changes completely to a slow pulse as the song comes to a close.<br />It is very easy to tell that this song is a Masterpiece as it doesn't even feel like you've been listening to it for almost ¼ of an hour.  This song is obviously about Tuomas and it's written so well you can't do anything but feel for him and all that he's been through.  A musical and lyrical self-portrait of someone who is becoming one of the better composers of our time.  10/10<br /><br />2) Bye Bye Beautiful:<br />Many people describe this song as the \\"Wish I had an Angel\\" of Dark Passion Play.  I disagree wholeheartedly.  Wish I had an Angel seemed like an afterthought for the Once album, where Bye Bye Beautiful carries on the theme set in The Poet and the Pendulum.  The only resemblance to Wish I had an Angel that I can hear is that Marco sings the chorus.  This song is heavy and fast which grabs you from the first note and carries you through a killer chorus all the way to the end.  Any old Nightwish fan knows exactly what the core of this song is about: the departure of Tarja and the reasons behind her firing.  Bye Bye Beautiful is written incredibly well and lets you glimpse into the emotions that Tarja was putting the band through with her antics towards the end of her days.  It's also very fun to sing along with this one.  9/10<br /><br />3) Amaranth:<br />I agree with most other reviewers about Amaranth.  It was the second single off this album and is very much a song that is designed to grab your attention.  It does it very well.  Anette sounds great and you can hear a bit of an expanded vocal range from her in this song.  Musically this song is right on, and while some people think that this song commercializes Nightwish, I think it shows off that Nightwish can be versatile and adaptable.  This defiantly isn't the best song on the CD, but it's pretty darned good.  7/10<br /><br />4) Cadence of Her Last Breath:<br />I have always have mixed feelings about this song when I listen to it.  It has a weak start but ends very strong.  The song picks up at about two minutes in.  Is that too long to wait for a song to get good?  Maybe, especially when the song is only 4:14 long.  I feel that the music in this song is spot on, and the vocals are lacking and a tad awkward, perhaps if this song was put together differently it would have been a bit better.  Still, when the song is over I feel satisfied.  As someone else said, Nightwish at its worst is still better than most bands at their best.  7/10<br /><br />5) Master Passion Greed:<br />Checking in as one of the heaviest songs on this album and possibly the heaviest song Nightwish has ever written, Master Passion Greed's theme may not be quite apparent.  I remember reading somewhere that Tuomas wrote this song about Tarja's husband Marcello.  Most of the band (especially Tuomas) hated him, and it's very apparent in this song.  Once that is understood the song becomes enjoyable and less weird.  Lyrically this song is angry, musically it is even angrier, when combined we get an opus of emotion that gets pretty scary towards the end.  Marco does a great job on the vocals here, though this isn't his best work vocally on the album. It is said that Nightwish will never play this song live because the anger that was present when it was written isn't there anymore.  That's too bad because this would be a hell of a song to see live.  8/10<br /><br />6) Eva:<br />The first single released internet-only in May 2007 off this album.  This was the first taste we got of Anette's singing ability.  I must have listened to Eva over 100 times already due to the fact that for months it was the only new Nightwish song that I had available.  Tuomas has written a hell of a song here.  The Piano is beautiful and complements Anette's vocals extremely well in this song.  Dare I say that I think if Tarja had sung this song she couldn't have done it as well as Anette does?  I do dare say that! It seems to be a sad tale of a girl who runs away from home. What an amazing song that I can't bring myself to skip even after all the times that I've already listened to it.  It continues to amaze me.  9/10<br /><br />7) Sahara:<br />A very 1001 Arabian Nights feel to this song.  Of course it does, that's what it's about!  It starts strong and ends stronger.  Due to the subject matter of this song, it does have a distinct epic feel to it, though nowhere near as epic as The Poet and the Pendulum.  A very well composed, played, and sung song.  Amazing drum and guitar work is apparent here, thanks Jukka and Emppu!.  9/10<br /><br />8) Whoever Brings the Night:<br />I almost peed my pants when I heard there was going to be another vampire song on this CD, after all, Slaying the Dreamer is one of my favorite Nightwish works.  Written by Emppu, lyrics by Tuomas, I really like this song.  I have read a lot of reviews that place this song as the least favorite on the album, but I disagree.  Maybe it's my love for vampire songs, or maybe I'm a sucker for the catchy chorus.  One reviewer had it right: \\"It's very much is a guitarist's song.\\"  The vocals come across with a slight mysticism to them that fit the song very well.  I say good job Emppu, I look forward to hearing another Emppu original.  8/10<br /><br />9) For the Heart I Once Had:<br />This song makes me think of the band Sentenced for some reason, not sure why, just sounds like something they could have done. Anette's voice is so sweet sounding in this song.  It's heavy but at the same time very elegant and soft.  For a song that is about the death of a child it doesn't sound very sad.  It's actually somewhat upbeat and pleasant on the ears.  An excellent song, but probably will be overlooked.  Please, don't overlook this one! 9/10<br /><br />10) The Islander:<br />This song marks a change of pace for Nightwish in two ways: Partly because Marco wrote it, and also because it's very Celtic in its design.  This is also the second song that Marco gets on the album where Anette sings supporting vocals.  If you had any doubts about Marco's singing ability, this song should put those doubts to rest.  It's an incredibly beautiful song and sung with such conviction it can almost bring you to tears.  Some people talk about \\"sleeper hits\\" that kind of sit on an album and don't get much playtime but are much better songs than most of the band's popular hits.  I believe The Islander falls into this category; it will forever be one of my favorite Nightwish songs.  10/10.<br /><br />11) Last of the Wilds:<br />Finally!  Another instrumental!  The last one was Moondance on Oceanborn, and I absolutely loved Moondance.  I wish Tuomas wrote more songs like this, he really is good at the instrumentals.  Last of the Wilds continues the Celtic theme of The Islander and is the perfect song to follow it.  It takes you on a fantastical journey through the wintry lands of Finland and out to the frozen sea. Yes that's right, it's an instrumental, and it's so good you can see, hear, breath, and feel the song while listening to it.  Another favorite is born.  10/10<br /><br />12) 7 Days to the Wolves:<br />A heavy,heart-pounding song that grips you from the beginning and won't let go until the end.  Marco and Anette alternate vocals on this song and do it very well.  I like how Marco is getting more mic time; he has such a great voice.  The only downfall in this song is that the chorus could be a bit stronger, but that's just a minor gripe.  Overall this song is killer and almost as heavy as Master Passion Greed.  The violin work is amazing and placed perfectly.  Bravo, another hit in my book!  9/10<br /><br />13) Meadows of Heaven:<br />The final song on this album, and the song which showcases Anette's voice, Tuomas's piano work, and the rest of the band's talent to whip out a song that may very well be the best album-closer that I have ever heard.  The amazing part about this song is that you can hear everything, nothing is jumbled, it all comes across clear, loud, and prominent. I read that Tuomas wrote this song describing the place where he grew up.  It's hard to choose a favorite song on the album between The Poet and the Pendulum, The Islander, Last of the Wilds, and Meadows of Heaven; but this is certainly up there as contender for best song on the album.  The end of this song is so powerful I just can't describe it; you must hear it for yourself.  10/10<br /><br />Well, that's my review of Dark Passion Play.  I hope it was informative, entertaining, and most of all, I hope it helped you decide to buy this album.  Dark Passion Play shouldn't be missed!cause the anger that was present when it was written isn't there anymore.  That's too bad because this would be a hell of a song to see live.  8/10    6) Eva:  The first single released internet-only in May 2007 off this album.  This was the first taste we got of Anette's singing ability.  I must have listened to Eva over 100 times already due to the fact that for months it was the only new Nightwish song that I had available.  Tuomas has written a hell of a song here.  The Piano is beautiful and complements Anette's vocals extremely well in this song.  Dare I say that I think if Tarja had sung this song she couldn't have done it as well as Anette does?  I do dare say that! It seems to be a sad tale of a girl who runs away from home. What an amazing song that I can't bring myself to skip even after all the times that I've already listened to it.  It continues to amaze me.  9/10    7) Sahara:  A very 1001 Arabian Nights feel to this song.  Of course it does, that's what it's about!  It starts strong and ends stronger.  Due to the subject matter of this song, it does have a distinct epic feel to it, though nowhere near as epic as The Poet and the Pendulum.  A very well composed, played, and sung song.  Amazing drum and guitar work is apparent here, thanks Jukka and Emppu!.  9/10    8) Whoever Brings the Night:  I almost peed my pants when I heard there was going to be another vampire song on this CD, after all, Slaying the Dreamer is one of my favorite Nightwish works.  Written by Emppu, lyrics by Tuomas, I really like this song.  I have read a lot of reviews that place this song as the least favorite on the album, but I disagree.  Maybe it's my love for vampire songs, or maybe I'm a sucker for the catchy chorus.  One reviewer had it right: \\"It's very much is a guitarist's song.\\"  The vocals come across with a slight mysticism to them that fit the song very well.  I say good job Emppu, I look forward to hearing another Emppu original.  8/10    9) For the Heart I OnceHad:  This song makes me think of the band Sentenced for some reason, not sure why, just sounds like something they could have done. Anette's voice is so sweet sounding in this song.  It's heavy but at the same time very elegant and soft.  For a song that is about the death of a child it doesn't sound very sad.  It's actually somewhat upbeat and pleasant on the ears.  An excellent song, but probably will be overlooked.  Please, don't overlook this one! 9/10    10) The Islander:  This song marks a change of pace for Nightwish in two ways: Partly because Marco wrote it, and also because it's very Celtic in its design.  This is also the second song that Marco gets on the album where Anette sings supporting vocals.  If you had any doubts about Marco's singing ability, this song should put those doubts to rest.  It's an incredibly beautiful song and sung with such conviction it can almost bring you to tears.  Some people talk about \\"sleeper hits\\" that kind of sit on an album and don't get much playtime but are much better songs than most of the band's popular hits.  I believe The Islander falls into this category; it will forever be one of my favorite Nightwish songs.  10/10.    11) Last of the Wilds:  Finally!  Another instrumental!  The last one was Moondance on Oceanborn, and I absolutely loved Moondance.  I wish Tuomas wrote more songs like this, he really is good at the instrumentals.  Last of the Wilds continues the Celtic theme of The Islander and is the perfect song to follow it.  It takes you on a fantastical journey through the wintry lands of Finland and out to the frozen sea. Yes that's right, it's an instrumental, and it's so good you can see, hear, breath, and feel the song while listening to it.  Another favorite is born.  10/10    12) 7 Days to the Wolves:  A heavy, heart-pounding song that grips you from the beginning and won't let go until the end.  Marco and Anette alternate vocals on this song and do it very well.  I like how Marco is getting more mictime; he has such a great voice.  The only downfall in this song is that the chorus could be a bit stronger, but that's just a minor gripe.  Overall this song is killer and almost as heavy as Master Passion Greed.  The violin work is amazing and placed perfectly.  Bravo, another hit in my book!  9/10    13) Meadows of Heaven:  The final song on this album, and the song which showcases Anette's voice, Tuomas's piano work, and the rest of the band's talent to whip out a song that may very well be the best album-closer that I have ever heard.  The amazing part about this song is that you can hear everything, nothing is jumbled, it all comes across clear, loud, and prominent. I read that Tuomas wrote this song describing the place where he grew up.  It's hard to choose a favorite song on the album between The Poet and the Pendulum, The Islander, Last of the Wilds, and Meadows of Heaven; but this is certainly up there as contender for best song on the album.  The end of this song is so powerful I just can't describe it; you must hear it for yourself.  10/10    Well, that's my review of Dark Passion Play.  I hope it was informative, entertaining, and most of all, I hope it helped you decide to buy this album.  Dark Passion Play shouldn't be missed!
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is an absolutely wonderful story about the things that keep us going, even when our world falls apart. You will find yourself pulled into this tragic story, unable to put the book down. This book will touch your heart on a very real level. I can't wait to read it again.
B000V4UFZK|4.0|It's hard to believe that it has been 25 years since the release of the Steven Spielberg/Tobe Hooper masterpiece Poltergeist.  What is even harder to believe is that Poltergeist gets a near-bare bones DVD release to celebrate it's 25th anniversary.  Now before you go off screaming at Warner Brothers, let it be said that first and foremost the audio and video quality of the film has been completely remastered.  Even in a regular DVD format, Poltergeist has never looked or sounded this good from what I can remember.  The one special feature that was included with this release is a documentary on hauntings in the real world that features interviews with experts as well as some of the crew of the film, which is an interesting watch on it's own, but that's it in terms of features.  No commentary track to be found, no documentaries on the film itself; absolutely nothing in terms of looking back at the making of the film.  Not only is this baffling, it's unacceptable.  As for the film itself, Poltergeist still remains a compelling creepfest and one of the best efforts to come from Texas Chainsaw Massacre writer/director Tobe Hooper, even though there are times when the film still feels as if it's Spielberg at the helm instead.  Regardless, if you have fond memories of Poltergeist and don't already own the previous DVD release or don't care much about DVD extras, then by all means pick this up.  However, if you already own the previous release, you might as well keep waiting for an extras-laden edition that may very well see the light of day somewhere down the road.
B00008AWOD|3.0|The good songs are The Bitter End, Plasticine, and This Picture.<br /><br />Threatening, malevolent, depressing, cacophonous, and sad. They've succeeded in what they set out to do. Call me a bubble-gum pop pilgrim, but Placebo are more horrible than the Velvet Underground, since heroin was a vehicle of pleasure. These guys write songs so honestly morbid, without the comic backdrop of Shock Rock or Death Metal, that it is ultimately really depressing. This is music like a Francis Bacon or Lucian Freud in their \\"flesh is rotting meat\\" periods, a florescent lit autopsy of sonic deconstruction that reduces the fun parts of rock to steel. More artful and pop-tune driven than The Swanns, but just as depressing.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|Action maestro Richard Donner may have brought Superman to the big screen first, but was dropped by Warner Brothers while shooting footage for the first sequel.  Richard Lester ended up receiving sole credit for directing Superman II, but fans had been clamoring to see Donner's original version for some time now.  Now, Richard Donner's version of Superman II is here, and while there are a good amount of differences between his and Lester's versions (most notably the development of the relationship between Clark and Lois, the revelation of his identity, and the appearance of Marlon Brando) the overall tone of the film is still the same (albeit Donner's take is a little darker), and it still remains one of the best superhero sequels ever made.  That being said, whether or not you prefer Donner's version or Lester's version is entirely up to you, but it's worth picking up just for comparison's sake.  Included is an insightful commentary from Donner and additional scenes that never made it into either version, and no matter which version of Superman II you prefer, you'll no doubt agree that either or is much better than any Superman film to follow in its footsteps.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a nice light little flash. It gives much better results than the built in on my D200. I use it for the quick snapshots indoors rather than pulling out my SB-800. It is very simple to use.  it has an on and off switch and a bounce head.  you can also purchase the Sto-fen diffuser for even better results. It also works great for fill flash at close ranges outdoors. This is a must have for all the D40 owners as well!!

B0000AQS0F|4.0|This is a great set. If you were a fan of the series it is great to be able to watch these whenever you want. The best thing this set does is takes the fan of the film Serenity and enhances their enjoyment of the film by giving an expanded view of \\"the verse.\\" With the same writer/director as the film the series has the same feel as the film with just a bit less in the budget for F/X, but the writing more then makes up for that and in my opinion actually makes it so only multiple viewings brings out the slightly lower F/X and by multiple I mean it took me the 6th time through to see anything and then it is only fleeting or just could be that way with any F/X movie you see and so it could just be the same as when you realize the camera is moving and not Galactic Cruiser in Star Wars, a little of your innocence dies (OK that is an exaggeration, but it fits the mood). All in all this is a great series to own and will provide countless hours of enjoyment.
1402714572|5.0|Treasure Island is perhaps THE classic pirate's tale. Robert Louis Stevenson, the author, created a rich story of adventure and treachery on the high seas all seen through the eyes of a boy named Jim Hawkins. Jim starts off as the son of tavern owners in a humble little port village. When an old seaman stays at the tavern, trouble soon follows him in the form of a pirate crew seeking revenge. I will not give away any more specific plot points, but events move forward to a great treasure hunt, treachery, and a surprisingly engaging story for adults as well as children.     Jim Hawkins is the hero of the story and he's a good lad with a stout heart. Long John Silver is the real star, however, and his character is a fascinating character study in moral ambiguity... or perhaps a study in amoral perfection. The pirate language is good and thick but this edition has plenty of notes to help you decipher some of the references that have become too obscure for today's readers. The plot moves along very briskly with no wasted scenes.     In short, Treasure Island well deserves its status as a beloved classic. It's a story of suspense and adventure that can be enjoyed at a child's level, but has substance for adults as well. I would recommend without reserve it to virtually anyone.
B000F1IQN2|4.0|As always Spielberg has hit a home run. He does a great job of not completely making one side or another the villain. Most of the action in the movie is shown from the side of the Mossad hit squad's point of view, but that is the way the book it has been based on was written. Another reason is that the account in the book is written concisely and as impartial as possible given the situation. From that book Spielberg has put together a spellbinding movie that keeps you in suspense even if you are familiar with the real life events. The story follows the timeline pretty accurately, but as to the specifics no one will know them until evidence is released by the Israelis which won't be in any of ours or our great grandchildren lifetimes. The movie is also up to the high visual standards Spielberg sets for himself with each of his projects. The menus fit in with the other visuals, such as title, main credits, and look of the movie. It is a well put together package and is a great addition to any DVD collection.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I've missed the sound of the E-Street Band and finally an album where they are all back to form. For me, this is the best album since the BORN IN THE USA. I love all the songs from the rockin' \\"Radio Nowhere\\" to the introspective \\"Devil's Arcade\\". Bruce has always been a master storyteller and poet, and the imagery in this album is clever. I don't always agree with all of Springsteen's views, but I've always admired his passion.
0385751060|2.0|In his afterword, author John Boyne admits that one writes a Holocaust novel at his own risk -- and risk he has, in a novel that ultimately fails, I think, due to its naivete and utter lack of realism.<br /><br />Boyne chooses a 3rd person limited point of view through the eyes of Bruno, 9-year-old son to the new German commander of a place called \\"Out-With\\" where there is a massive fence populated with huts and people with striped pajamas.  Bruno has no idea what this all means.  Worse, he has a 12-year-old sister (Gretel) who also has no idea (at least at first).  They are children to an obviously highly-placed Nazi soldier (\\"Father\\"), hail from Berlin, and yet don't seem to know that there's a war going on (it's never mentioned).<br /><br />Therein lies the problem.  These kids are worse than naive -- they're beyond the pale.  12 and 9-year-olds are not stupid, and world wars (where your father is not only a player, but a major one) are hard to miss, much less avoid talking about.  Adding fuel to the unrealistic fire, Bruno meets and befriends a \\"boy in striped pajamas\\" somewhere along the fence at Auschwitz (er... \\"Out-With,\\" I mean).  They meet most every day.  Apparently this prisoner (named Schmuel) goes unmissed and makes the meeting spot without a problem each day.  Such freedom is beyond any description I've ever read about concentration camps -- as is the fact that any part of a fence would so regularly remain unguarded.<br /><br />Other, smaller problems exist.  For instance, the first time he is met, Schmuel is described as wearing a Star of David on an armband.  Later, apparently forgetting this, Boyne has Schmuel draw the star in the sand to show Bruno what they all had to wear when they were first put into ghettos back in his Polish city.  Of course, the word \\"ghetto\\" is never used, either.  Nor is \\"Auschwitz.\\"  Nor is the word \\"war.\\"<br /><br />I cannot share as evidence the coup d'etat among these jolting doses of unrealism -- the final straw, in this case -- because it would give away the ending.  The sentiment of Boyne's denouement is undeniably sad and the moral quite sweet, but the vehicle he uses is so poor and so suspect that it is impossible for readers to be affected in the manner he would hope.  At first I wondered if his audience might be equally naive readers of age, say, eight.  But such young readers, too, would demand answers and explanations -- the provision of which would make Boyne's conceit pointless, I think.<br /><br />I feel bad about the low rating because the moral is so admirable in its way.  Unfortunately, well-meaning morals or no, the tale is so distracting and disconcerting that any and all lessons are lost.ive away the ending.

0810993139|5.0|I purchased this book for my 12 year old daughter as something lighthearted to read on top of her expansive list of challenging novels.  She finished it in an hour, laughing all the way.  I started reading it to my 6 year old son -- the first few entries were hilarious!  He then picked it up on his own because he couldn't wait for me to continue. He just started reading simple chapter books and I was surprised that he mowed through this in a weekend.  I think the comic style and large font were unintimidating, and the text was engaging and downright funny.  Although this book is about a middle schooler, even much younger kids will appreciate the humor.
075640407X|5.0|I used to read a great deal when I was a teenager.  I went through fantasy novels like some people go through newspapers; once a day with extra on Sunday.   Time passed.  I grew up and grew away from books in general until now it's a wonder if I take in a novel a year.  I was shopping for a book about composting and just wanted something to take me up to that \\"free super saver shipping\\" level so I bought \\"Name of the Wind\\".  It's amazing how sometimes the smallest decisions can lead to something incredibly wonderful.    \\"Name of the Wind\\" is the absolute best book I have ever read in my life.  It is a rich tapestry woven of colorful and compelling characters, powerful combinations of tragedy and comedy, clever storytelling, and an amazingly detailed world.  It is completely incredible and at the same time completely unpretentious and completely unique.  It is exactly the kind of book I wish I had written (back when I had dreams of such things).  I don't even feel equal to the task of articulating exactly how good this book is.      All I can say is \\"Name of the Wind\\" is so good, I feel almost apprehensive about the next book in the trilogy because I can't possibly imagine how any other book could be the equal of this one.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|If you're an Annie Lennox fan, you'll no doubt love this album.  Rarely do I hear a CD and like the entire thing... not since Diva, actually.  The lyrics stick with you, and you end up listening again and again. Possibly her best work yet.
0767903862|5.0|It's obvious in reading this book that Bryson fell head over heels for the land down under.  What makes him such a great travel writer is that, in love or not, he never resorts to  gushing.  He maintains the dry wit and eye for oddities that are his trademarks. I particularly liked the recurring bits about sharks and other potential agents of death. Bryson shows us a country full of interesting, likable and hardworking people; a harsh country not without problems, but a gosh-darned interesting place. You'll laugh a lot reading this, but without laughing at anyone. That's a difficult thing to pull off, and Bryson does it. His affection for the place is palpable.  This is a great armchair travel book.
B000V801PK|5.0|Ok, so I have both the standard and Deluxe editions. Below are my negative and positive thoughts on the item:<br /><br />Positive:<br />- Booklet has 19 pages compared to the 12-page booklet in the standard edition<br />- There are more photographs in this one, than the standard edition<br />- The booklet is connected to the package itself, meaning less damage<br />- You get 2 discs for only a few dollars more than the standard edition<br />- The deluxe edition is very slimine and fits into a protective plastic mini-lp CD sleeve<br /><br />Negative:<br />- The CDs are subject to scratches while removing or inserting them into the cardboard package due to lack of protective plastic inner sleeves<br /><br />My feelings on the album itself:<br />As I said in the review of the standard edition...SOMD is very powerful music. Annie has weaved for us, a spectrum, an array of colors, mood and emotion. As with DIVA and BARE, SOMD tells an emotional rollercoaster of a story of its own, although it's far less grumpy or sad as BARE. Whether Annie croons, drops to a soft whisper or just plain belts it out in her clear alto style, I love every song, now that I've heard the album enough. I still think \\"Coloured Bedspread\\" is my favorite, because it's mysterious, sensual and upbeat with an Eurythmics edge. The song in particular caught my attention and I added it to my ipod playlist instantly. \\"Dark Road\\" is the perfect opener for SOMD because of the marriage between \\"stepping on eggshells\\" feel, as well as the rock-chick edge Annie gives it when the organ & guitar come in about 3/3 of the way through the song. Couldn't have a better Glen Ballard edge to it, if you ask me.<br /><br />Am not sure whether the album would've sounded any different with Stephen Lipson as producer, cos Annie's quite the powerhouse no matter whom she's working with. Annie's a genius when it comes to writing music/singing and dressing up as well. I simply adore the photos in the booklet and appreciate having more to look at when I open the booklet of the deluxe edition, regardless if it's glued to the packaging or not. After 3 solo albums, this is how I rate Annie's albums:<br />DIVA<br />SOMD<br />BARE<br />MEDUSA<br /><br />BARE was raw, gloomy and vengeful. DIVA was exquisite, romantic and lovely. MEDUSA was a mishmash of everything while SOMD frees Annie of her saddened thoughts and showcases her powerful range and stellar songwriting talents. Annie always speaks her mind and sings it too. SOMD is such a strong CD and it sucked me in deep, though BARE and DIVA controlled my emotions many, many times. Upon listening to \\"Sing\\" for the 1st time, I was bored and wanted to skip it. But I listened to the entire album twice over and quite enjoy this song with its catchy chorus line. So much time & love went into the making of the song, and you can hear Madonna's voice in verse 2. \\"Fingernail Moon\\" inspired me to want to go look out my window at the moon and think in wonder. \\"Smithereens\\" is my 2nd favorite track on the album because of the heavy piano arrangement, paired together with Annie's clear, no-nonsense alto pipes. All the songs i haven't mentioned are fine just the way they are. There's no filler here. You should buy the Deluxe Edition because it's wonderful, and in time, it'll grow on you if you're not loving it already.<br /><br />Bonus Features include an interactive menu with the choice of Audio or Video commentary + the video of Dark Road. There is a photogallery with 3 photos and links as well. I personally enjoyed listening to Annie's commentary on my discman because I'm better at listening to her speak than watching her.tion, regardless if it's glued to the packaging or not.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|The sound quality of \\"Let It Be Naked\\" is 1000 times better than the original \\"Let It Be\\" disc or LP.  The overall clarity and the bass sounds are better than any other Beatle's CD I've heard.  Many people think this is the Beatles worst album.  If so, it's better than 90% of the other rock music out there.  I like it as most of the songs are not worn out from radio play.  Chatter between songs has been omitted and a cool, different version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" that I've never heard before has been added.  I would suggest they remaster their whole catalog like this cd.  Quite the improvement.
0805209999|4.0|Kafka I maintain is the funniest writer in 20th Century Literature. Seriously. You don't think so - name another great comic writer. A GREAT comic writer. Yes, yes, there are funny writers, such as P.G. Woodehouse, there are writers who ram their books with jokes like an goose liver on the eve of fois gras, but who can match Kafka for sheer, metaphysical, universal funniness. Kafka is Charlie Chaplin's embodiment that life is a tragedy in close up, a comedy in the long shot. Up close, the story of Joseph K is indeed a ghastly one. As Kurt Vonnegut pointed out, the trajectory of this sorry tale is no arcing parabola but a tale of a man who is already in a pretty sorry way at the start and finds his plight gets steadily worse with no respite. What misery! K, imprisoned for an unspecified offence, lurches woefully from one mishap in the penal bureaucracy to another, meeting characters singularly unsuited to helping out in his plight - a painter, a priest. In the end he faces his inevitable fate with the sort of shrug reminiscent of Maimonides. The final page has a scene of black comedy of a pitch not even Samuel Beckett  managed to accomplish - the odious knife passing ceremony in front of the victim. Poor Joseph K. Kafka was a proponent of the view that just when you think you are at rock bottom and things can't get any worse - that's the point at which they inevitably will.<br /><br />Poor Franz.<br /><br />And then he gained the posthumous reputation as the greatest writer of the Twentieth Century.<br /><br />What comedy!
B00000GBHA|5.0|What I love most about this album are the lyrics. They truly send shivers down my spine and have meaning on many different levels. I know his work was meant to be a social/political commentary, but it works just as well as a wound licker for after one of those nasty break-ups.    The south african band - Just Jinger - did a great cover of Sugarman if you like this song.     Mellow, cool blues/rock guitar riffs and smoothe vocals - experimental at times with synthesizer. Rodriguez is definitely a hall of famer in my books. We need more Rodriguez in our lives!
0143038419|4.0|I was almost embarrassed to read this, given the book's sappy title and its inherent \\"Oprahness\\".  I ended up enjoying it immensely.  I admit, too, that I was deeply jealous of Gilbert (Italy, India, Indonesia...wow!), but I came to like her for her enthusiasm and her guilelessness.  Many might find her spiritual quest a bit offputting, but this book is really less about finding your soul and more about learning to love life and love yourself.  It's about making your life what you want it to be, and then letting go.  Anyone who has been in an unsatisfying marriage, who has dealt with depression, who has cried out her guts on a cold bathroom floor (yes, it's a scene from the book)..should read this book. If I had more courage, and money, about a decade ago, I would have done exactly what Gilbert did, because I was in a very similar place.  As I read this book, I slowly grew to like the author more and more, even when it's obvious she was being used by her Balinese friend, and even when she goes to great lengths (in oh-so-politically correct terms) to justify the crass greed that her friend exhibits.  Gilbert puts her heart on a platter for her readers.  She can infuriate, she can be a bit too self involved, and she can sometimes give us a little too much information.  But she's given us a gift here.  This book will be good for those it's good for.  If you are intrigued by the subject, you will probably like it.<br /><br />Assuming, of course, that you are female.  I think this is a chick book exclusively.

B000URDEB0|4.0|There's a lot of ground to cover in this review, so I will be as concise as possible. Firstly, regarding the album in and of itself, BUY IT.  (I warned you this would be concise, after all.)  It is still Nightwish, and there are simply too many high points to enumerate in this space.    That having been said, there are four issues I want to address quickly: the effect of the new singer on this album, the effect of the production on this album, why I only gave it four stars, and whether this is a good starting point for those new to the Nightwish world.    Regarding Annette Olzon's vocals, the fact is that she is simply more dynamic than Tarja.  There are spots where I feel Tarja's voice would have fit better, but this is inevitable when you have two very good singers in comparison.  However, Annette is bringing to the equation an unprecedented level of versatility, and bearing in mind that this album was not even written with her voice in mind, I can only conclude that the next step for Nightwish will be an even more amazing sound.    It has been mentioned that the production on this album is sub-par.  I agree with this sentiment, as the orchestral instruments seem to be relegated just far enough beneath the rock sound for the first-time listener to be annoyed by their absence.  This, however, is not nearly enough to cripple the album.  While I don't approve of the production one hundred percent, all of the sounds still have enough room to keep the album alive and very much kicking.       The reasons this album did not receive five stars in this review are the  aforementioned production flaws and the three middle tracks (Sahara, Whoever Brings the Night, and For the Heart I Once Had).  Sahara is not as bad as the other two, but I feel that the complaints of a more accessible or pop sound stem from these tracks.  The writing is simply not up to par with what I would expect from Tuomas.  Still, that leaves ten more tracks, and I probably wouldn't complain about Saharaif it didn't transition into the next two songs.    If you are new to the Nightwish world, I will recommend that you buy this and least one album with Tarja on it to experience the full spectrum of the band's sound.  I don't have the familiarity with their entire catalogue to recommend which album is the best of the litter, but I will say that it is impossible to go wrong with Once (which may in fact be a five star CD).  If you are new to gothic or orchestral metal in general, I would like to quickly suggest that you peruse the related bands on this site or another, and if you don't mind death vocals I highly recommend Tristania's Midwintertears as a great insight to the heavier end of the genre.    In conclusion: Nightwish is not merely \\"back,\\" but has in fact never left our hearts and spirits, and this album will further cement this fact.            Long live Nightwish!
0316010669|5.0|I've been recommended to read this book by my mentor, and I have to say he was right (as very often he is). This is definetely the kind of book that make you say: hey, I didn't know, but know that I'm thinking about, that's true!    Interesting episodes that you have always lived, and know you can understand why
B000RW3YYA|3.0|My review is not on the episodes of Season 3 as other people have already done that but rather a question.  I purchased this set in New Zealand and found there was no Chapter Index.  The retailer said that they were all received like this.    Has anyone else had this problem (I typed a list of the episodes on each disc so that a least I could find the one I wanted)?

0743464117|5.0|Stephen E. Ambrose tells the stories of Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, US Army, from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's nest and up to now (for some members of Easy Company). The company was established in the summer of 1942. The men came from different backgrounds, different parts of the United States. By the last evening of 1944, the company became an elite unit of airborne infantry. They parachuted into France early D-Day morning, captured Carentan, fought in Holland, held the perimeter at Bastogne, fought in Rhineland campaigne, and took Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden. The company took almost 150 percent casualties.    This is a terrific read for World War II buffs.
B000000WG4|5.0|Yeah , most people know that \\"Tubular Bells\\" was the theme for \\"The Exorcist\\" way back in the early 70's.<br />It is easy to see why it was chosen. From the moment the music starts , it grabs hold of you and doesn't let go. Having listened to this recording well over 500 times since it's release , I can honestly say I have listened to it from start to finish every time.Never once disappointed that I chose it to play.
B00006AVRK|4.0|This is great fun to watch.  Each episode is 45 - 60 mins.  Wodehouse has a wicked sense of humor!!  These two actors are perfect for the parts!!
B00008CLOA|5.0|A perfect example of SACD, the only problem I have is that there isn't any more Pink Floyd in this format. Wish You Were Here anybody????

B000E6EJAC|5.0|The argument amongst Mott fans is usually- \\"Which is better- 'All The Young Dudes' or 'Mott' \\" ? Listen to them both back to back, and try to find one bad track on EITHER album. Good luck ! (By the way- lyrically \\"All the Young Dudes\\" , musically \\"Mott\\")
B000000HHE|5.0|I'm serious, I can count on ONE hand the number of songs that immediately changed my world like \\"The Magic Number\\" did the first time I heard it. I truly had no idea it was possible to make music like that. I was flipping through stations on a road trip and came across it about halfway through. My jaw literally dropped open, I made everyone else in the car shut up, and I stared at the radio and waited for them to tell me what I had just heard. I then spent an entire day going to every record store in NYC's Greenwich Village trying to find it (distribution was tiny).    I've probably listened to this album 500 times over the years, and it just never ever gets old. De La Soul is Dead is also excellent, and Buhloone Mind State is very very good, and they kind of lost me after that, but I truly believe everybody I know should own this one.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|After waiting with wild anticipation for this release, I have to say that I was not disappointed.  I really enjoy the wide range of songs on this release; it is refreshing to hear some original songs as well as a few standards.  Ms. Kent's amazing voice has never been better. After listening to it, I fall in love with these songs more and more.  Mr. Ishiguro's contributions make \\"Ice Hotel\\" such a great song. (the more I listen to it, the more I understand the deeper meaning of it). I agree that Ms. Kent seems so at ease on this release.  Her arrangement of \\"Landslide\\" sounds better than the original. I just love the variety of French and English.  My only regret is that there were not more solos of Mr. Tomlinson's, as I really enjoy his sax playing.  Just a sweet, sweet release that will surprise many with the originals. I just hope we don't have to wait long for her next release.  I can never get enough. BRAVO to Ms. Kent and Mr. Tomlinson.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|What an outstanding concert. It really puts George Harrison's music in good perspective. He wrote some great music and the great musicians performing, did his music justice.  No competing egos on stage which gave the focus to his music and not the musicians.
B00008J2TM|5.0|I was 13 when I got this album for Christmas.One of my faves(along with the other 1st 5 CCR discs)Ive gone thru a couple of albums and 2 differant FantasyCds.Missed out on the DCCs(DID manage a Bayou,and Cosmos from them tho---great sound)Everyone who reads a reveiw of this disc no doubt knows how great it is.I want to let everyone in on the secret of the sound quality of these discs(The whole CCR hybrid sacd series).There is no comparison.Upper and lower range are extended beyond belief.Separation is goosebump time.If you love this album,and appreciate great sound as well,you MUST try any of these SACDs,masterd by SteveHoffman,the guy who did the DCCs as well.They will bring tears to yer eyes.Happy Listening indeed!!!!!
0786838655|4.0|Although I might disagree that the USA is the centre of Western Culture, this is a fun read.  Percy Jackson is just such an interesting character.  When we meet him first he's in his Sixth school in as many years and this school is a school for troubled kids.  Strange things keep happening around him, he's got ADHD and Dyslexia and his stepfather hates him<br /><br />When he realises that he's the son of a Greek God and that because of this he's the subject of interest from monsters from myth and legend.  He gets a chance to go to Camp Half-Blood, where Mr D (or Dionysus) supervises the half-gods.  However someone has stolen Zeus' Thunderbolt and Percy is the primary suspect.  Will he survive to find the real thief or will the Gods kill him.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|Watched this with great anticipation yesterday evening. How could this miss? (I thought).  Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro, Alec Baldwin.  A short cameo with Joe Pesci, too.      Well, it misses.  The history is compelling; the sound effects and sets excellent.  The performances are also excellent.  However, the back-and-forth \\"flashbacks\\", etc. make the story difficult to follow.  I have a serious interest in history, but even I had trouble figuring out what was going on; I had to spend a lot of time explaining what was going on to my wife . . .!       Biggest problem was the vocal track; far, far too subdued.  I realize that this is a \\"spy movie\\", and everybody constantly talks in low voices and whispers . . .but several times we had to \\"rewind\\" a bit to try to follow what was going on when we couldn't catch the dialogue the \\"first time\\".    Plus, you'd better be wide awake when you watch this, or you'll fall asleep; it's a \\"quiet\\" film, with little action.      Bottom line; do what we did; rent it, watch it, but don't buy it.  This is not a film you'll want to watch more than once.
0743455967|5.0|If you enjoy Stephen King novels and his method of storytelling and are looking to do some writing on your own, this book is for you.  King carefully and comically explains his pet peeves, suggestions for greatness, and ideas for writing anything in this book.  His anecdotes make On Writing read like a narrative rather than a how-to book.  King gives creative and straightforward advice for all writers (not just the newbies).  Definitely a recommended read!
1400063515|5.0|Nassim Nicholas has written a very important book. The first chapters seemed a bit slow but once he got going (or maybe I got thinking) I could not stop. Anyone making any type of business, marketing, or investment decision and relies on prediction needs to read this book. My hat is off to him as a writer and a big picture thinker.
B000V8I2QU|2.0|I agree with others about the sound quality here. It's like Bruce went for some sort of retro \\"Wall of Sound\\", only louder. Whatever, the great band sounds like a mess. As for the songs, I'd say this is a pretty unremarkable album. I can't think of one on here that I'll be screaming for him to sing when I see him live in a couple of weeks. And in a couple years, I won't remember any of them. There's nothing fresh about the music or the lyrics. Mabe Girls in Summer Clothes and Radio Nowhere, but that's a reach. None will make a \\"Best of\\" list.
0385486804|5.0|This was one of the best stories I've read in years!  I totally related to Chris and his quest.  It was thought provoking and I couldn't put this book down.  I read it 3 times in a row!
B000I2JDEY|5.0|The acting in this movie is absolutely superb, but a lot of credit should go to Edward Albee as well. His play is a fascinating read, and Mike Nichols debut film as director RULES!!! The intensity of the performances and also the subject matter was groundbreaking. This really is my favorite dramatic film. Another Mike Nichols film I truly enjoyed was the film \\"Closer.\\"
0803726570|5.0|Make room on your child's bookshelf for this one, but be prepared to take it off again and again.  This book is a perfect book for any time of the year, and the rhyme just flows off the tongue.  My daughter and son both love this one and I would recommend it to anyone (except maybe some religious fanatic who took the story too seriously).
B000IFQLSW|5.0|The DVD was awesome.  It's wonderful that these blues players will always be remembered.  One artist that especially touched me was Etta Baker.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The level to which we appreciate, admire, and adore the angelic harmony and orchestration of Celtic Woman will vary, but most feel they are taken to a new height of musical bliss when we truly listen to this phenomenal group. Composer and arranger David Downes does a masterful job of creating and blending the voices and instruments of Celtic Woman. Each lady has her own style and uniqueness, yet they are incredibly perfect in combination with each other. Watching them perform live in Louisville, KY, I not only appreciated the sound but the energy that flowed from the stage. Was some of the music prerecorded to make up for not having a full orchestra? Sure. Did it make the voices of Meav, Chloe, Lisa, and Orla any less exciting? NO! And what about Mairead. She graced the stage with energy and excitement that made for a great time. Because these women have true talent and were able to break the world record for being at number one the longest with their debut album, they earned every star before the first note of the concert. My wife and I came with high expectations and we left well satisfied. Celtic Woman will be number one on my charts for a while to come. By the way, I just watched their Christmas DVD. Incredible!!! It is easy to see why it was their own Christmas album that replaced their debut album at number one on the world music charts. Also,  should David Downes become so inspired as to arrange some music in the jazz genre for Celtic Woman, we will once again behold their ascent to number one, earning every star of the five stars we give them. Finally, since so many have described these voices as angelic, perhaps one day we will find their sound echoing the sentiments of heaven itself, singing classic and contemporary hymns that glorify the very God who gifted them with such great vocals. When all is said and done, I am sure to find Celtic Woman receiving another five-star review.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|This is an amazing film. Like Kill Bill it's message of strong and fearless women willing and able to avenge themselves sets it apart from the standard slasher flick. Kurt Russell delivers a pitch perfect performance as psycho Stuntman Mike. The violence and gore in the film, while extreme, allows the brutallity of the crimes to become painfully personal. In classic Quentin style the music throughout the film is perfect and becomes a much loved character.   This is one you have to see to believe!
0689859368|3.0|The Grace children, Mallory, Jared and Simon have moved into their great aunts old house. Strange things happen, and Jared finds a hidden study and an old book - \\"The Field Guide'    Not much to say since it is a very short book- really just the beginning of the story that is continued in the next books. It seems promising and the ilustrations are good. I would definitely give it 4 stars- if there was more here. Instead of breaking the book into five short books- I think it would have ben better combining them into two or three longer books. As it 'The Field Guide' isn't really a complete story- just an introduction to one.
B000W9MMPU|1.0|This is the quintessential example of Hollywood greed. If you actually thought Ocean's 11 was a decent remake, you can't buy it. You've got to pay for the horrific remakes done twice where this famous 21st century brat pack of actors were paid a ransom to have a blast and horse around without a script and take advantage of a franchise name. Perhaps the worst trilogy around, you have to have rocks in your head to want to pay over $50 for the \\"privilege\\" of owning all three. Wait a few weeks for this to be in the clearance rack and pick it up for few quarters. Shame on the studios and may you take a beating on this disgraceful attempt to capitalize on your monopoly.
0679409998|5.0|Once you read Shelley's classic you're going to scratch your head and wonder: Is this really the book that gave us the Karloff movie? Not to mention Herman Munster and Frankenberry. For over a century and half people have been cannibalizing this book for ideas, movies, other books, and products of every size, shape and type that our modern concept of Frankenstein holds little to no resemblence to the master work. While occasionally these bastardizations have had enjoyable results, like Young Frankenstein, it's criminal that so few people are unfamiliar with the source.  Do yourself a favor and find out where it all came from.  It's not nearly as creepy as you may think, but it's infinitely more thought provoking and it certainly doesn't hurt that this version is beautifully published at a very reasonable price.
B00005JPFH|4.0|This is the best one made so far. The love triangle was a little weird but the rest of the movie was great.
0440237688|5.0|I just want to warn anyone who has yet to read this book NOT to read the review by Jedidiah Palosaari which is listed as the third review at the time of this writing (until after you've read the book).  Although I think it's a well written review, it contains a spoiler!  Now, for my comments... This story is provocative for sure.  I read it out loud to my kids even though they're really old enough to read it for themselves.  The images are vivid, and the author Lois Lowry does not shy away from the spectrum of human possibility, the good, the bad, the ugly.  Lowry stirs up all kinds of moral and ethical questions in this book.  There are some children's books that I love reading to my kids because they are great for the kids. This one is great even into adulthood.  If you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend it.  It is brilliant and, as others have noted, a classic. If you're a parent, this is a good family read (more older kids or screen it first) for opening lots of discussion and an opportunity to teach what you value.<br /><br />Laya Saul, author of the teen self help book \\"You Don't Have to Learn Everything the Hard Way\\"
B000TGCR38|4.0|Dutch director Paul Verhoeven always pushes the limits in his films, which makes them stand out.  \\"Zwartboek\\" or \\"Black Book\\" won the Best Director Award for him at the Netherlands Film Festival + Best Film and Best Actress Award for Carice van Houten.  The film's episodic structure comes in flashback as we start in Israel in 1956 and then work backward into the war.  This allows the audience to know that the main character Rachel Stein or Ellis DeVries survives.  Van Houten also won the Best Actress Golden Calf Award in the Netherlands in 1999 for \\"Suzy Q\\" & in 2002 for \\"Minoes.\\"  As Stein/DeVries, she combines luck with an amazing wish for survival that carriers her through the film.  Michael Huisman plays Rob, a young sailor with a boat just as Rachel's hiding place gets bombed.  Sebastian Koch plays the German commander Ludwig Muntze that DeVries befriends.  Their physical relationship grows beyond convenience and survival into a touchingly beautiful love.  Muntze is a dashing romantic lead.  Thom Hoffman plays Hans Akkermans that we think is a good guy for much of the film, until we see him try to kill Ellis with an insulin injection.  Hoffman plays the good guy/villain with rugged abandon.  Halina Reign plays Ronnie that Ellis meets while working for the Nazis & trying to get intelligence for them.  She has an affair with Gunther Franken played by a rotund Waldemar Kobus that Verhoeven lets loose frolicking au natural in the bathroom. Verhoeven will probably best be known in the U.S. for his Hollywood films like [[ASIN:B000VD5I94 Robocop (1987) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B00070FX5U Total Recall]], and [[ASIN:B000E5N684 Basic Instinct - Director's Cut (Ultimate Edition)]].  This film tells the story well, with excellent characterizations, pacing & cinematography.  Enjoy!
B000V8I2QU|1.0|Ladies!  You can watch The Guiding Light or listen to these tunes.  Take your pick!  Bruce Inc.'s fulsome lack of irony, insight, and art is on display here as it has been for 30 years.  Ancient, simple, tired cadences.  Faux tough guy.  Faux working class.  He may be dumb--but knows how to screw his face into a sort-of scowl (maybe it was the bad veal).  He created 2 good albums in the early 70s.  Other than that...  Do yourselves a favor and stick with Tom Jones.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Marilyn Manson must have tired of the aggression that reached it's pinnacle on [[ASIN:B000001Y2U Antichrist Superstar]], because \\"Mechanical Animals\\" was a huge swing off the beaten path. Where his slaving devotion to angry industrial Nine Inch Nails rock had been was suddenly replaced by a new concept. He was now a new personality, Omega and his Mechanical Animals. Like David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, Manson drenched himself in glam and made (in my opinion) his classic. If Anti-Christ was the drug fueled rage against the system, Animals was realizing the deflated crash.<br /><br />That he slowed the beats down and explored the range of his songwriting gave Manson some much needed breathing room. This was the best gothic-glam theatre since [[ASIN:B00001OH7S Diamond Dogs [ECD]]] or [[ASIN:B000056W0F Billion Dollar Babies]]. It's easy to be a shock rocker when the guitars are turned up to 11 and songs are played at 110mph. But slow it down to a grind and growl, like he did on \\"Dope Show,\\" and the message gets into a lot more living rooms...terrifying the same parents who once defied their Moms and Dads by blasting [[ASIN:B000002KBB Love It to Death]]. (And who will ever forget the video with the pink cops kissing each other? What better way to piss off your parents?) Add a mordant worldview that insists that everything is rotting on the bone (\\"Fundamentally Loathsome,\\" \\"User Friendly\\") and that self-destruction is the only way out (\\"Dope Show\\" \\"I Don't Like The Drugs\\"), and you get suburban angst without peer.<br /><br />Manson stretched in other directions, too. There are echoes of Pink Floyd in \\"Speed of Pain\\" and the brilliant closer, \\"Coma White.\\" That kind of musical sophistication probably alienated his already alienated core of disaffected worshippers from pre-\\"Anti-Christ Superstar;\\" Manson's cleaned up music and international infamy was turning him into one of the \\"Beautiful People\\" he used to rail against. But as far as I am concerned, this was the last album im which Manson was really doing something dangerous. He made an album both bound to throw off the die-hards and still draw the ire of the God-nazis who looked at a rock singer as an acolyte of the devil. After this (and those stupidly misguided attempts at connecting Manson to the tragedy at Columbine), the albums retreated to the generic rock thrills of [[ASIN:B000050ITX Holy Wood (In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death)]] and [[ASIN:B000PDZJ0S Eat Me, Drink Me]]. While Manson still made his attackers look like blithering fools (never has a shock rocker been more articulate and equipped to take on his naysayers - I used to live for his stops at \\"Politically Incorrect\\"), he couldn't remake himself musically shocking after \\"Mechanical Animals.\\"was really doing something dangerous.

0880796863|5.0|If you are a new ager or Wiccan that likes flash and form, this may not be for you. If however you prefer the old ways, deep Western mysticism, and nostalgia, then this pack should be a delight to use. It is not \\"pretty\\" and bright like many, but I find it to have very deep \\"feeling\\" and the cards are more intuitive for me. Especially if you are into Golden Dawn or Western mystery systems, this is the pack to understand, as much of the symbolism is in there. But again, if you prefer something bright and colorful, for looks rather than use, then this is not for you.
B00005TT77|5.0|When Michael Jackson - who owned the rights to The Beatles music at that time - put a $300,000 price tag per use of each song, Sean Penn had two options for this soundtrack; write a check for at least $4.5 million or commission artists to record cover versions.<br /><br />He opted for the latter and - in a project which was recorded in about three days - what was produced is one of the finest movie soundtracks ever. The 17 tracks - the European edition has three additional songs - are fitting tributes to the poetic majesty of The Beatles, with each artist adding a bit of spice from their own performance repertoire.<br /><br />The signature song may be Across the Universe by Rufus Wainwright, as the vocal/guitar combination is absolutely stunning. Heather Nova's rendition of We Can Work It Out is nothing short of powerful, while Grandaddy brings a healthy dose of David Byrne-inspired quirkiness to Revolution.<br /><br />Eddie Vedder (You've Got to Hide Your Love Away), Ben Harper (Strawberry Fields Forever) and Ben Fields (Golden Slumbers) are standouts, with Nick Cave's Let It Be a fitting way to end the CD.<br /><br />The soundtrack stands alone as a masterpiece and - at the very least - will be pointed to by music critics and fans as a beautiful tribute to a revolutionary band whose music will continue to stand the test of time.
061891868X|5.0|Lee Smolin presents a harsh critique of the last 30 years in theoretical physics, written by one of its practitioners. He makes the excellent point that science is a human activity like anything else.  Progress is always hard to predict; scientists can and do get caught up in dead ends.  Smolin thinks string theory is one such dead end, and makes a good case for it.<br /><br />I think that, if anything, Smolin is a little too gentle on the field.  The development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs left a tremendous impression that big money put into physics would bring big results.  In recent years that hasn't happened.  There are so many unanswered questions out there in science, so many important fields where solutions are desperately needed.  When I consider the construction and operation of particle accelerators and other high-tech equipment, I can't help but think of the huge cost.  The same amount of cash invested elsewhere might have brought much more in the way of useful results.<br /><br />I am the mother of a 10-year-old boy attending public school.  His instruction sometimes seems to me like a mishmash of well-meaning educational reforms that have been implemented with little or no testing to see if they worked or not.  I am frankly disgusted by the quality of most research in the area of education--sample sizes too small, no proper controls, subjects followed for too short a time, etc.  The cost of operating a single particle accelerator for six weeks probably exceeds all the funding for educational research around the world for the entire year.  Yet which has the most potential for making major progress?  Maybe it's time to back off on funding big physics projects for a while.<br /><br />I would also like to point out that the building and use of instrumentation for high-energy physics is highly dependent on cheap fossil fuels.  The future supply of such fuels is by no means guaranteed.  The peak oil problem appears to be largely ignored by high-energy physicists today, but has the potential to significantly affect their ability to conduct experiments.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Smolin's chapters on looking for seers rather than technicians in science.  I especially liked his description of how unconventional scientists have built a career without a university job.  Smolin points out that a typical professor spends a majority of his week on teaching, grant proposals, administrative tasks, and the like, leaving a surprisingly small amount of time available for actual research.  Having a day job outside the field is not as big a hurdle as it might seem.<br /><br />I tend to agree with Smolin that the big advances of the future are likely to come from completely unexpected directions.

B000TEUCFA|5.0|The title of the review may be a little bit misleading. I am really big Stacey Kent fan, and I had full confidence that her vocals would be amazing on this album. I also knew that her husband, Jim Tomlinson, and the band would put on a good show as well. What I was surprised about were the wonderful original songs written by Jim Tomlinson and Kazuo Ishiguro.     Many songs in the great American Songbook run a very fine line of being (too) corny or too shallow or just plain awkward. I think many people know what I am talking about. It is a fine art to write songs in that genre which can be seen by their lasting appeal.     Anyway, the original songs on this album are really wonderful. My favorites are probably \\"So Romantic\\" and the opener, \\"Ice Hotel.\\" They have a wonderful composition and storytelling quality about them, and you couldn't find a better storyteller than Stacey Kent. I wasn't really sure about Breakfast On the Morning Tram, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it. I think \\"Ice Hotel\\", \\"I Wish I Could Go Traveling Again\\" and \\"So Romantic\\" would all make great additions to the Great American Songbook.     This is probably the best that Stacey Kent's band has ever sounded (at least recorded). Very nice interplay, and they have a little more space to do their own thing.     Everything is great on this album, but other songs that really stand out are \\"Landslide,\\" (it sounds even better after a song like Ice Hotel) \\"Ces Petits Riens (oh yeah, Stacey Kent's French is superb; maybe she should consider an entire French album), \\"Hard-Hearted Hannah\\" (I would really love to hear this song live. It sounds like she is having a blast on the album) and finally \\"What a Wonderful World.\\" (a truly breathtaking performance)    Ok, I went on long enough. Do yourself a favor and purchase this album!
B000DWMN2S|5.0|First time I saw this movie on HBO I was stunned. Note, I'm Ukrainian myself, still have a relatives there, so I can see and read between the lines easy. But this concept of the movie is simple the best. You have to be ready to accept the level of unusual information. Of course it's greately simplified most, but a lot of things is real. It is very phylosophical and sad and loving. And very funny. Actors and dog and everything else is SOMETHING ELSE, I'm telling you. Highly recommend, and I'm bying it for myself and for my neighbor. His grandfather is Jew from Kiev.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Prelude to review:  Enough of the best since \\"The River\\" stuff.  I'm a Bruce fan going back to my high school days and have been around from nearly the beginning and I understand the lure of trying to rank the albums, but it's not really possible.  I'm sure it's been said somewhere else, but it's like trying to pick your favorite child - I love'em all, why would I pick between 'em?  And the review:  This is the best Springsteen since...just kidding.  It's simply just great Springsteen.  One very good indication of this is that Sirius Radio has gone back to having their all Springsteen station for the relase of \\"Magic\\".  Lot's of music from all across Springsteen's career with \\"Magic\\" stuff sprinkled in and it stands up very well, thanks.  Imagine doing the same thing with an Elton John or many of the other musical acts of the 70's and early 80's.  If you put John's current stuff on against the 70's stuff you'd be going, \\"Same guy?\\".  With Bruce, the whole body of work sounds great and the coherence of themes and yet the growth that you hear across time is impressive.  This is one of those albums that rewards repeated listening.  I get the criticism from some that there is a sameness to the sound at points in the record and that the pace is slow at times.  But there are some tremendous textures and some absolutely killer hooks in here that, once they settle in, are like candy that you can't stay away from.  \\"You'll Be Coming Down\\" is one of those I let slip by the first few times, but which I adore now.  \\"Girls In There Summer Clothes\\" is totally beautiful, set aside the wondrous music and just check out the lyrics.  Great detail, great story, and almost an \\"you ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright\\" kind of moment towards the end.    Finally, Bruce has this great gift for creating sign posts for where we are in time.  If someone knew nothing about 9/11 and wanted to know not what happened, but what it felt like I'd give them a copy of \\"The Rising\\" and say, \\"It feltpretty much like that\\".  \\"Magic\\" captures the United States and the world it is situated in in 2007 just as skillfully.  Not so much a diatribe - although there are elements of that here - but more of a weary frustration with the disconnect between what we could be and what we are.  There is surely magic here.  Well done, once again, Boss.  And hats off to the E Street Band as well.

0743289684|5.0|Thank goodness there are women like Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and thank goodness she has a voice.  I think she should receive a Nobel Peace Prize for her courage in speaking out about the abuses committed against Muslim women; I hope it doesn't cost her her life.    I couldn't help but notice the similarities between hard-core Islamic fundamentalism--- the duty to convert classmates and save them from Hell; the severely authoritarian treatment of young girls, to the extent that they do not even feel like persons; the fetish of virginity and extremely prevalent circumcision of female children (Ali refers to this as being \\"branded\\" by an owner); the enforced child-like dependency of women (\\"because I was born a woman, I could never become an adult\\"); women being conditioned to put themselves last; women who have to declare whether they are virgins or not when they get married; practitioners feeling superior to unbelievers, etc.--- and the same kind of Christian fundamentalism we find here in the U.S.  The same things happen here; it's just a matter of degree and different costumes for the women.    Hirsi Ali's tale is a bildungsroman of exceptional courage by a woman who stands up to not only her family and her clan and her religion and people who are trying to kill her, but who also is consequently at risk of death for being an apostate.    She is very grateful to the Dutch culture that took her in when she escaped and provided her with money, housing, and education, and she points out the difference between Dutch girls who are raised to be self-reliant and Muslim girls who are raised to be docile and submissive, and how this inhibits their transition (and the transition of their children) to modernity.    I was particularly interested in her discussion of Muslim schools, which she says \\"suppress the critical faculties\\" and \\"... neglect subjects that conflict with Islamic teachings, such as evolution and sexuality\\", because our own Christian schools do exactly the same thing.And now, we have voucher programs that are supporting religious indoctrination by directing taxpayer money from diverse populations into Christian-only endeavors.  I believe we could learn something here, from the situation Ali described in the Netherlands.  Ali, as a member of the Dutch Parliament, tried to abolish laws that permitted the establishment of religious schools, and she feels that when countries take in people from backward and abusive cultures (in her words, \\"We froze the moral outlook of billions of people into the mind-set of the Arab desert in the seventh century\\"), that allowing them to carry on their culture off to the side somewhere and not strongly encouraging their integration into the mainstream is a mistake.  She says that the message of her book is that \\"... we in the West would be wrong to prolong the pain of that transition unnecessarily, by elevating cultures full of bigotry and hatred toward women to the stature of respectable alternative ways of life\\".    Hirsi Ali speaks of the need for a Muslim Enlightenment, something that would address \\"...the relationship between our faith and the behavior of our men\\", and she wishes for the liberation of Muslim women.  On a Dutch TV show, she explained that \\"... Islam was like a mental cage. At first, when you open the door, the caged bird stays inside; it is frightened. It has internalized its imprisonment. It takes time for the bird to escape, even after someone has opened the doors to its cage.\\"    Surely if Muslim women say \\"I may no longer submit\\" (the last line of Ali's movie Submission), their revolt will benefit us all. And perhaps a Muslim Enlightenment could lead to a Christian Enlightenment, and indeed to a dialogue about the divisiveness of all religion.  Surely people will see that brutalizing and limiting women, who are the caretakers of children, will affect their treatment of those children, and surely men can realize that the love of a woman, freely given, is immeasurably more valuable than her coerced compliance.

B00000295Y|5.0|One of the last true Rap (\\"Gangsta\\" or otherwise) albums ever made. Let's face it folks, much like Punk Rock, it now exists in name only.<br />When you spin this album, you hear many layers of sweet sound. Among the finest of the genre, richness and funky goodness was the norm up `til the early to mid `90's when even the once mighty Cypress Hill began to fall into the rut and devolve into boring, two dimensional \\"Rap\\". The new motto basically became \\"Find just one simple hook and play the piss out of it\\". Long gone are the days when you'd find daring and unique sound on a Rap album. You'd be hard pressed to find merely one or two songs in any of today's \\"rappers\\" complete discography (much less their latest album) that would bring to mind anything that the pioneers and the 2nd generation were producing. What you have today are essentially Pop artists in disguise. For Cypress Hill, just dig the unassumingly deep and funky tune that asks \\"How could I just kill a man?\\" and then fast forward to the dippy self-parody of \\"Dr Greenthumb\\" to understand the contrast. In a way, Cypress Hill's career is a microcosm of what Rap was, and what is called Rap now. Somewhere along the way, Rap, in general, decided to forego effort into creating great sounds you bob your head to, and seemingly focused on trying to wow you with lyricism, which still really isn't that great. The only thing I consider close to Rap these days is Turntablism, which is such a niche sub-genre that it's literally off the map while it also consistently lacks an MC/MC's. I just about guarantee nobody in their right mind will be listening to the \\"Rap\\" that's put out today when they're into their 30's and 40's and beyond. At the same time, I know you'll be hearing the likes of A Tribe Called Quest playing in old folks homes 40 years from now.<br />If you like the current state of \\"Rap\\", then more power to you. Taste in music is as subjective as any other art form, if not more. I'm only saying that if you want a history lesson in what once defined the genre, (drug and thug content aside of course) then by all means buy this album. It still holds up as one of the best. Nobody can deny that Louis Freese, Lawrence Muggerud and Senen Reyes are one of, if not THE best vocal combinations ever assembled in one rap group due to their diverse and unique sound. And for their first few albums at least, they had the super-funky beats behind the vocals.history lesson in what once defined the genre, (drug and thug content aside of course) then by all means buy this album.

B00005JO5L|4.0|Back in 1980, this William Friedkin shocker caused such a controversy that it seemed that everyone condemned it.  The gay community was in an uproar over \\"Cruising\\"'s frank display of male sexuality and what amounted for many to be the generalization of a \\"lurid\\" gay lifestyle depicted in the film.  The religous community followed with their own  uproar over many of the same issues (albeit for different reasons). The movie was further slammed by critics and audiences alike, who either found the film to be homphobic, dull, nasty, and/or overly sensational. Personally, I think that critics, in particular, were disappointed because they found \\"Cruising\\" to be a  major step down from William Friedkin's previous hits (\\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"The French Connection\\"). However, after viewing the recently released DVD of the deluxe edition, I have to say that \\"Cruising\\" is not nearly as bad as it's reputation might suggest.  First of all, as a gay man who was recently out and about in 1980, I don't think that the gay culture of the time is misrepresented here.  Friedkin made the film shortly before the spectre of AIDS descended upon the community, and there was a wide open, hedonistic  sexuality that seemed to be prevalent in every aspect of gay life.  The homosexuality depicted in \\"Cruising\\" was in context with the reality of the times, regardless of what revisionists may proclaim.  I remember being very disturbed, at the time, by the hypocrisy of gay leaders who wanted to deny the overt sexuality that was a fact of our existence.     Second of all, I don't find \\"Cruising\\" to be a dull film.  While I don't find it to be erotic, or exciting in the tradition of other detective films of the time--there are no car chases ala \\"The French Connection\\"--I do think that it is an effective psychological thriller detailing one man's very dark journey into unknown territory, encompassing both his environment and his very heart and soul.  Al Pacino is surprisingly good as Steve Burns, a plucky, green young cop selected by his superior officer (Paul Sorvino) to go undercover and track down a serial killer of gay men frequenting S&M clubs, parks, and sex shops.  After his performances in the Godfather films, \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\", and \\"Serpico\\", among others, it's interesting to note that Pacino was able to bring the depth of believable naivete to his character; it makes the character's transformation all the more shocking.  Paul Sorvino also delivers a first-rate performance as Pacino's boss, a longtime cop who always seems to be withholding something (information, concern, money).  A pre-\\"Indiana Jones\\" Karen Allen is also on hand as Pacino's girlfriend, although her scene of primary impact is reserved for the final seconds of the film.     The quality of the deluxe edition is pristine, with the gorgeously restored cinematography suggesting that the film is of more recent vintage than 1980.  Yet, the clothes, hairstyles, scenes of New York street life--all suggest a New York of another time, not so long ago, yet long gone, in so many ways.      I don't have any major problems with \\"Cruising\\", certainly not the ambiguous ending nor the fact that not all the loose ends are neatly tied up for the viewer.  I actually prefer it that way, and it makes for a more interesting experience that is open to interpretation.  And it's interesting that about half the people on the screen actually look like Pacino and there are scenes where you think that you're watching Pacino, only to discover that it's somebody else. And vice versa. And sometimes you're never 100% certain who you're watching.  I think it's an interesting idea because it forces the viewer to come to his own conclusions, it doesn't offer easy answers. The same goes for the film's suggestion that there may be multiple killers--again, the viewer is forced (like the police at the end of the film) to draw his or her own conclusions. \\"Cruising\\" is, in may ways, a demanding film with characters that many mayfind disagreeable or downright unlikeable.  I like \\"Cruising\\" because it does make you think and because it offers no apologies, no easy way out.

B000V8I2QU|5.0|You have probably heard a lot of good reviews about this album, and what can I say, they are all true ! This is Bruce Springsteen's best album since 'The River'.  In a time, where I am usually shuffling through all my old and new stuff on my iPod, this is the first CD this year, that I actually played over and over again in my stereo. No filler material here !  If you like it, when the Boss rocks, then this album is for you. If you prefer Nebraska, then you will only find one slow song on this album.  It is great, to hear the E-Street Band again - Glockenspiel and Organ Fills included !  For me, this is the best new CD release of 2007 !
0060005696|2.0|I actually do think that many people suffer because of too many choices.  I have seen this in upper middle class people agonizing over school choices for their grade schooler.  A big part of the problem is that they CAN afford private school, or to move to a neighborhood with better public schools, but which one?  They end up second guessing themselves and changing their mind every year and causing a lot of misery for themselves and the child.      That said, the book takes a few fairly simple ideas, repeats them several times and doesn't offer much help.  There is some research (not clear how much it really applies) that shows that having more choices makes you less happy with the choice you make, having more choices increases the chance you will delay deciding, etc.  There are a few ideas in the back that may help some people with decisions - things like narrowing choices quickly to 2 main choices, learning to accept good enough for many of life's choices, etc.  I suspect some of these are easier to say than do.    Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book.
0143038419|5.0|What's interesting to me is that 74% of the reviews (that's 368 out of 495) gave this book a 4 to a 5 rating.  Most were 5 ratings.  I believe 495 reviews on any book is exceptional participation.  I also find it interesting that those who rated this book a 1 or 2 were just 90 people or 18%.  A very few of you thought it was a 3.  Wow......what is amazing to me is how most if not all of the lower ratings were vapid and cruel.  That's pretty sad!      I'm a dedicated student of A Course in Mircales and I do a lot of spiritual reading.  I don't claim or profess to have any part of the market cornered on evolution and becoming a more authentic person, but when the truth is presented in such a way that there is no reason to doubt, regardless of our ego's motivation to automatically do so, then that is what is called striking a chord.  When a chord is struck and it resonates positive, then it is working at it's highest form.  When a chord is struck and it resonates negative, then it's working at it's lowest form.  I believe they call the highest form security.  I believe they call the lowest form judgement.  We have choices to make every second of every day.  I try to select the positive as often as possible.  It doesn't always happen that way.  I'm at times a spiritual skeptic, but when the author talks about being in the palm of Gods hand and what that moment was like, that is true spiritualism at it's most innocent.  That is authentic.  I believe this lady is authentic.  She also never claims that her journey is the only way to achieve that level of truth and honesty.  It was her journey.  You don't have to travel the world to experience the same thing.  She claims there are three things we each can do every day, and that is:    1. Every morning ask yourself \\"what do I want today?\\".  This can be about anything.  2. Every day chant your mantra.  Perhaps something that accentuates the positive about yourself to the exact spot on your personal journey and destination.  3. Every evening before turning in for the night, recall the 1 happy thing from the day.    I think this is good advice.  We can all do this and it immediately brings us into a better frame of right mindedness.  That's the best place to be.  I'm truly sorry for those of you who thought this was a waste of time and felt the need to attack.  There are better places in our minds to function that requires no attack.  It's much less painful.  I believe that she has a lot to teach and we can always use another good lesson.    Peace!
1400063515|2.0|Really can't understand all the great reviews of this book.  The author THINKS he's witty, when he's really just showing off his arrogance.  Trust me, he's no Larry David....as one other reviewer seemed to think.<br /><br />But the real letdown of this book is his foggy writing, which is almost always a sign of foggy thinking.  And to MAKE UP one of his prime examples (the author with the unpronounceable Slavic name) and then to continue to bring up other examples using \\"her\\" is simply lazy research and writing.  If his premise is so true, surely he can find real life examples to share with us.  He probably intimidated his editor so much that this really annoying writing style was not challenged by the publisher.  A layperson  can find many better books written on the subject of randomness.
B00005K3NY|2.0|This is another one of those movies that I wasn't really looking forward to watching but my boyfriend was very insistent that I see it.  I know it's meant to be on of those \\"scary\\"/thinker/suspense movies but I ended up laughing through a good chunk of it.  The acting was terrible but the music was semi-decent.  I'll give it that much.  Of course, I'm not an expert on this genre but Scanners just didn't click with me.  The whole thing was just too predictible.  The ending just added to the predictibility.  If you want a classic stereotypical thinker movie, then feel free to watch it.  Worst comes to worst, you laugh instead of quaking in your boots.

It is rather engaging, and Gregory Peck, although giving one of the greatest performances of all time, did not give Atticus Finch the justice he well deserved.    Highly recommended.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I always feel somewhat guilty buying remastered editions of CDs I already own - like I'm the ultimate surrogate whore to the record companies who have somehow tricked me into laying down my hard-earned cash for stuff that's already on the shelf at home (and don't even get me started on the whole \\"3-disc extended unrated directors cut limited edition\\" DVD thang...).  What's the old P.T. Barnum saying?  \\"There's a sucker born ev'ry minute?\\"  Exactamundo, P.T. - but NOT with this remaster of the first David Gilmour solo LP, thank gawd!  First of all, the sound on this CD is VASTLY superior to the original Columbia issue.  Second of all, many of the tracks on this remaster are noticeably longer than the ones on the LP and original issue CD - some by a good 30+ seconds!  What does that mean?  Well, on the now-longer tracks, you get MORE blazin' Gilmour guitar solo outros - which is AWESOME because I often thought that with many of the tracks on the original edition, the fade started just when he was staring to rock out.  Well, these new versions let Mr. G go OFF - full on!  I'm tellin' ya: when I was listening to this CD in my car, one of the \\"extended fades\\" came on and I actually asked out loud (to no one in particular, of course), \\"What's up with THIS?!  I've never heard THIS guitar work before!\\"  This remaster is worth every PENNY - even if you already have the original!
B000001FRY|5.0|U2's Boy is a great album.  It gully captures U2 in their great.  They went on to make more classic albums but I'll always have a place for this first one.

B000T05R8Q|3.0|While I'm happy to add this to my extensive collection of things-Floydian, this 3-CD limited version of \\"Piper\\" isn't anywhere near as awesome as I had expected it to be.  For one, there are absolutely no write-ups ANYWHERE that tell the story of the evolution of the album and its very important place in Floyd history (after all, this is, in a sense, Syd's first - and last - true Floyd album).  And, since they've gone through the trouble to put the mono and stereo versions on separate CDs -- AND include a bonus disc chock full of tracks that quite a lot of people think are on the original \\"Piper\\" to begin with -- how's about a bit of text explaining why this is so?  Nope...not one word.  Just lyrics, credits, and some sort of goofy reproduction of one of Syd's notebooks full-o'-scribblings (the latter of which is kinda neat - but ultimately unnecessary).  Don't get me wrong...this is still a great album, but there were SO many opportunities that were passed up on that could have made this 40th anniversary limited edition worthy of being called a \\"special\\" edition that I'm ultimately left with a feeling of disappointment.
B000P0J09W|5.0|The Goonies, written by Steven Spielberg and directed by Richard Donner, is a wonderful adventure story.  If you haven't seen it I won't go into it too far, but it's about four friends, accompanied by one's brother and his friends on a trip to find a Pirate's gold.    Quite wonderful.  This and [[ASIN:B00003CXIP Stand By Me (Special Edition)]] are the essential children's 80's movies that everone should see.  Magical.    As this is only a rerelease of the earlier version the features are the same.    Highly recommended.
0805079831|5.0|I enjoyed watching her on C-Span yesterday and already had started reading this book. In fact after watching her, I subscribed to The Nation and put her other books in my cart to purchase later. Today on Sundance Channel \\"The Corporation\\" (Ms. Klein was involved) airs at multiple times. I think it is important for everyone, particularly Americans to open our eyes to our leadership and then we understand why the rest of the world questions our arrogance and motives. Granted this type of greed contained in this book has been going on since the 1900's, but never so blatantly as in today's America. That's why books like this are so important as many of us do not take or have the time to explore what is really happening, maybe it's apathy or desiring to remain unaware.I think our culture is changing now as ordinary folks such as myself are tuning in to documentaries that show the unpleasant truth, are reading the modern versions of American history, and taking stock of what it means to be an American, rhetoric vs. deed. Thanks Naomi for another enlightening  book.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|As a life long Rush fan its hard to write down these words.  I really don't feel I am betraying Rush fans by speaking my mind and saying that this is without a doubt the worst Rush album.  I am not over critical of this band as I have come to appreciate and love every album this trio has ever put out. I couldnt honestly say there has ever been a bad Rush album.....until now.<br /><br />To put it simply...the main failure of this album is the Vocals and the Lyrics.  The music in and of itself is good but the vocals of Geddy squeezing in long sentences of lyrics into song melodies is painful to hear.  Its obvious that this Nick Foo Fighter producer did not take the time to stop these guys and say...this is not working.  Granted I wasn't in the studio and couldn't even know what kind of conversations might have gone on, but please someone must have noticed that there were no harmonies worth anything in the song structures and the lyrics themselves seem to paint a very negative and uninspired mood.<br /><br />Its ok to be dark and have a melancholy take on an album but it seems almost defeatist.  The songs that I liked best were the last 3 which in my opinion would have suited the album much better at the beginning where first impressions might have carried this album a bit further.  I also feel that Geddy should ease off the layering of his voice on too many tracks.  I appreciate some of the older songs where his voice is unaccompanied by special effects and or over dubbing.<br /><br />And since I hope this is my first and only critique ever of this wonderful band who has really inspired me through their music over the years....yikes on that cover art...they should have used one of the images from inside the booklet.  There I said it.<br /><br />Best of luck to the next album.  Please don't end your career with this one please!
B00000DGRX|5.0|I liked it then. I like it even more now.  It rocks... the louder it's played the better it sounds.  Quad mixes are cool, but not necessary; confusing as to what settings to use on my DVD player.   Plain ole' stereo sounds awesome w/ full bandwith in my car.  Favorite tune is Lazy remix...
B000TGCR38|5.0|Carice van Houten give her breakout role (at least in this country, many of her Dutch films aren't available here) in 'Black Book'.  Inspired by true events, the film mixes tense drama, action, and the flirtatious acting of van Houten to give an enjoyable two-hour plus of entertainment.<br /><br />Much of the attention regarding Black Book has centered on the sexy performance of van Houten, and she is the center of the film.  She in turn can be perky, cute, serious, and pensive, all while looking like a million bucks.<br /><br />The film explores the complex setting of the German occupation of the country in World War II.  Not all of the Resistance was as noble and mythical as popular memory would have it, and not all of the Germans were vile, disgusting pigs.  The plot has more than a few twists and turns, leading to a payoff in the end.<br /><br />As an aside, one nice thing about the film is the casualness it treats adult men and women in love and lust.  Adult subjects handled in adult ways is a refreshing idea.<br /><br />There is quite a lot of violence and violent images in the film, but all central to the plot.  The movie is subtitled but they are easy to read and are not obtrusive.<br /><br />The director's commentary is illuminating and interesting to listen to Paul Verhoeven's dissection of the movie as it rolls in real time.  Mr. Verhoeven was a young boy during the war and remembers some of the events depicted in the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|Being a rabid Pearl Jam fan, I didn't think twice before buying this album. Was I disappointed? Quite the contrary but I was left with a nagging itch that needed some more meat to scratch. The songs found here are wonderful and in regards to a reviewer who said Eddie's voice is shot, it could be that or maybe he wanted it to sound that way. I've seen PJ live recently and the voice sounds fine. Obviously not as pristine as PJ Circa 1991 but no slouch by any means. As for the music, what can I say? I'm humming the damn songs all day long. I want to click repeat, I wish 85% of the songs had an extra minute and a half worth of music. It's almost like some Jack Johnson gems that last under 2 minutes and you go wha wha what??? Give me just a bit more. That's what happens most times, you're left with a desire for longer tracks. one thing though, the rootsy folkish flavor is a real good side to see of Ed and I think does justice to his solo side. Good lyrics, solid hooks, great music but too short, hence me giving it 4 stars. If anything, this album should definitely prompt one to watch the movie and to hope for Ed to release a longer, fuller solo album. He showed he can pull it off but to be fair to the rest of the band, it shows PJ is not a one man show, but a meeting of great musicians that know how to feed off each other and create synergy. So am I a fan? Hell yes. but that should definitely not take away from a seriously powerful gem of an album. Feel free to take the shampoo approach to this album, listen, rinse and repeat as desired.     Cheers
B000QQFKYE|2.0|I am a big David Lynch Fan. I have all his movies, and I watch them frequently. This one however, I just could not grasp. I understand the dreamlike states he puts us in, but this one goes so far past that that even the most tuned-in fan has a hard time making sense of anything. I know making sense is not his intent, but this one was like watching channel changing for three hours straight.     This movie, shot in video, seems like a very experimental picture. Some effects work and others don't. David Lynch says that \\"He'll never go back to film\\" after using digital video for this movie. I hope that he'll reconsider in the future. The purity of film in his hands is magical.     On a positive note, Laura Dern proves that she is an amazing actress.
B000001E3L|5.0|Big Van fan and just picked up this album. I've written previously about Van's ability to combine songs (the live version of In The Afternoon/Raincheck), I won't call them medleys as it really transcends one song transitioning to the next. It's more of Van deconstructing two songs and building a new, entirely engaging one. He'll even put lyrics of one song to the melody of an other and it'll take you a few seconds to think \\"WOW!\\". The result is magical to say the least. So if you're concerned about medleys, open your mind in this case.    The next aspect of this album is the musicians involved. Van's brought together John Lee Hooker, Georgie Fame, Junior Wells...that's as good as it gets. As for Brian Kennedy, he's an acquired taste, and perhaps in small doses, adds an interesting vocal, but I have to say...not quite my cup of tea. And Shana Morrison is not in this league, though she appears just once I believe. All in all, the talent of the talent of the band outweighs any shortcomings of Kennedy.    Result: fantastic album. If you're a Van fan, you'll love it. P.S. It's available on iTunes for $10 if the $28 seems steep..though it's still worth the thirty bucks in my opinion.
B0002O7XWC|5.0|This movie is not just about riding, it is about counter culture and love for freedom---the feelings of the 60s.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper ride on a wirlwind journey of America after making money on a drug deal.  Along the way they meet a rather straight-laced (so to say) attorney played by Jack Nicholson.  It is their story and a remarkable road trip on a bike.  This movie brought us 3 great actors---Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson.  The sound track is incredible and this 35th anniversary DVD collection has a CD that includes the theme, \\"Born to be Wild\\" and many more.  I watched this classic movie again tonight for a different reason.<br /><br />For those Amazon friends that know me, I am a motorcycle enthusiast.  I love and have a passion for all motorcycles from dirt, speed and street.  I currently have a custom Harley (I had the photo of it on my profile, but had to remove it).  I do ride it on the dangerous streets in the city where I live.  If you never rode, as the driver, you cannot appreciate the feeling---being on the back is not the same.  Motorcycle riding has given me plenty of confidence, and it has taught me to be a better driver in a car or a boat.  When I have a bad day or week (which is currently happening), I hop on the bike and it's amazing---your problems disappear (for the moment).  I was taught to ride by a guy I was supposed to marry who was a motorcross racer, but it didn't work out.  I was a young stupid kid then and if I continued that way I would have surely been a statistic.  My husband, Darrell, suggested I learn the right way all over again.  I enrolled in a course.  I had the most incredible teacher who did not make fun of me or get angry during class and was very patient.  I am 5'3\\" and weigh about 100 pounds---pretty small to hold up a Harley.  He saw I was determined and cheered me on. Long after, when I had my accident he went over with me on how it happened, never ridiculing, but still teaching.  I wouldn't have been hurt had I had on my proper riding gear.  This one person, my teacher, Daniel David Jorasz was killed on his bike this past week, riding the right way.  A b@#ch lost control of her car trying to avoid a ladder, spun her car around on the freeway and hit Dan (\\"Double D\\") head on, he was killed instantly.  Proper riding attire didn't matter, though.  Please, if you drive a car avoid driving with a cell phone attached to your ear or under the influence or any other distractions, you never know what could happen and you could kill an innocent person. Also, respect and look out for motorcycles they share the road too...n hurt had I had on my proper riding gear.

B000002UA2|5.0|People who love Dark Side of the Moon really should check out Obscured By Clouds because the two albums sound a lot alike.  Really, both have the same kind of atmospheric elements, melodic songwriting, and powerful vocals.  Why this album didn't get the same kind of success and recognition is a mystery to me.  Check this one out and you won't be disappointed.
0440241901|5.0|I am an avid reader, and I read quite a lot of so-called chic-lit. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to read through this novel, which has a super clever and new theme. The idea behind the story is fresh, and I thought it was superb. It was such an entertaining read, and I loved the characters. I've passed this one on to many friends.
B000002572|3.0|While Boston had lots of success (and we can't deny it) when it comes down to it, these songs have been beaten to a bloody pulp thanks to overexposure.  \\"More Than a Feeling\\" may have been a great listening experience when it came out, but now it's been played SO many times I just wanna scream every time it comes on the TV or radio.  \\"Peace of Mind\\" is right behind it.  If I have to hear these songs ONE MORE TIME!!!     \\"Foreplay/Long Time\\" is yet another song we've heard more often than not.  While I like the instrumental bit \\"Foreplay\\", the song morphs into a typical, commercially-smooth overexposed nightmare of a song with \\"Long Time\\".  The rest of the tracks on the album are better, but again, how many times have we heard them?  Thousands of times.  \\"Smokin\\" and \\"Let Me Take You Home Tonight\\" are still tolerable, at least.      If you're starting your 70's rock collection with this band, it's gonna be a VERY long and mediocre ride.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|I'm not surprised that Cate Blanchett won an Oscar for her supporting role, playing Katherine Hepburn, but I'm shocked that Leonardo DiCaprio did not win for his brilliant portrayal of Howard Hughes.  With all Mr. Hughes's phobias and odd ways, portraying him must undoubtedly have been the ultimate challenge.     This movie was great! It was awesome seeing the genius of Director Martin Scorsese \\"pulling\\" the best from his actors and from each scene. Everyone pulled together to create a phenomenal movie that deservedly won five Oscars.     I learned many things about Howard Hughes and even more about what happened to the boy that helped form the man. Very sad in places, but uplifting in others.    I admire what Scorsese said about Hughes; very insightful: \\"You get a sense of Howard Hughes being Icarus with the wax wings. Those wings were great for a while, but he flies too close to the sun.\\"    That is so sad, but so true, as this film adequately depicts. I don't think it's a typical \\"tear-jerker,\\" but my heart went out to Hughes. I admit I used a few tissues.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Just watched the DVD.  It's awesome!  Loved the links to Kill Bill, great special effects, fab music as always, great dialogue.  All Tarantino fans should check out this movie.<br />I'm not that upset that they're not releasing the two movies together although would have loved to have seen the movie trailers.
B00006G8G1|2.0|I'm going to attempt to keep this short... I've seen Maiden live twice and watched Maiden England and this DVD. I thought their live shows were weak at best. Maiden England was a great video but this DVD was a true disappointment. I'm not sure what it is but this band seems to have difficulty coming together musically live. It's like everyone is playing at their own time and it doesn't come together like it does in the studio.     Now back to this specific DVD...     1. The first annoying thing you notice is how the camera shots change constantly in seconds. If they had 10 cameras filming I think it's safe to say all 10 got equal time. Eventually it makes you dizzy and you can't even focus on the concert you've paid for. Imagine going to a concert and turning your head to look at EACH musician for literally a mere second. Now over the course of the concert you've moved your head thousands of times... You get the picture and break out the Dramine.    2. The mix is poor. You can clearly hear the levels constantly rise and fall.     3. Bruce Dickinson is hyped up and runs all over the stage mumbling and screaming into the mic incoherently. Dickinson falls into the same catagory as Ozzy or DL Roth as a good frontman and a good \\"studio\\" voice after the clean-up and the final mix but live couldn't carry a tune in a wheelbarrow. Combined with the crappy camera work it's a disaster.    4. Again the band's timing is off or the mix is bad so things don't fit together the way they should.     On the positive side, the camera works is incredibly clear and the sound likewise but...    I'll sum it up this way...    If your a die-hard Maiden fan: You'll love it but you'll own anything they put out and accept it.     If you enjoy Maiden and want to see them perform (such as I): There's gotta be better choices out there but they are a band who tries to market everything they can so buyer beware.     If your Maiden experience is limited: If you watch this show you might not want to ever listen to Maiden again and move on to another band.     I now wish I didn't purchase this DVD.     I'm sure the show itself was great but the video wasn't!     We scour the web to find the best concerts and this isn't one of them.     I'm obviously a Maiden fan but I'm not going to mislead anyone. I've paid the price for you! Keep searching for a better live Maiden performance.     Happy Hunting!
015204907X|5.0|I highly recommend this for your bookshelf.  Our 2 year old son can supply  most of the words to the book.  We just have to start him out with \\"here's the ... and here's the ...\\"  and he'll fill in the rest.  When we get to the last few pages and he knows he's about to find the green sheep -- he squeals with delight.
0374280967|4.0|I'd so like to have Alan Bennett sitting in an armchair in the corner of my sitting room, chatting away in his Yorkshire accent, filling the room with his finely-tuned observations of life ...<br />This is such a perfect gem, a novella you can whiz through in an afternoon.<br />Mr Bennett plays with the notion of what would happen to Queen and country should Her Majesty become a serious reader. And what would she read?<br />He's captured her personality and voice to a T, and you can hear those regal, brittle vowels in her conversations with Prince Philip, her New Zealander private secretary Sir Kevin, and her friend and sole fellow reader, Norman, whom she whisks upstairs from the Buckingham Palace kitchens to be her 'amanuensis'.<br />There's much that will make you laugh, but also more wistful passages in which HM regrets, in her old age, the decades of opportunities she has wasted in meeting so many famous and important writers, without having had the faintest interest in them or their work.<br />As he did so skilfully in Talking Heads, Mr Bennett pokes gentle fun at his characters and their opinions, and shoots barbs at the bizarre social mores of the British class system. But the wit is sharp rather than acerbic, born of intelligence and affection rather than any desire to be cruel.<br />I loved it - there has to be a movie. They should get Helen Mirren to play this Queen, she'd eat it up!
B000UD0ESA|4.0|I had the opportunity to see the new \\"Final Cut\\" of BLADE RUNNER on screen in New York City this past weekend.  As always, it's one of my favorite science fiction films of all time and I welcome any opportunity to see it on the big screen, in any version.    First, I have to say that I saw this when it was first released in June 1982.  The original theatrical version with Harrison Ford's voice-over and the Hollywood happy ending is still and will always be my favorite version.  That said, the only thing I can honestly claim is an improvement with the \\"Final Cut\\" is the sharper, remastered print.  As far as the film itself, it is almost completely identical to the 1992 Director's Cut.  There are some extra pieces of dialogue and extended scenes thrown in, which in my opinion, don't expand the film at all.  The added scenes of violence are not new to the BLADE RUNNER fan.  They've been available for view ever since the film first appeared on video cassette in the '80's.    If you already own the Director's Cut of BLADE RUNNER on DVD, then save your money.  Buying it all over again for the \\"Final Cut\\" will not gain you much, except a larger hole in your wallet.
B000V674E8|5.0|If you haven't heard Fool's Overture, you're in for a treat!  It's a brilliant piece of work by Rick Davies of Supertramp.
B000UR9QGW|4.0|Evil Dead II is a classic horror film with cartoony overtones. This is the predecessor to Army of Darkness.    If you already own the DVD and are not a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies, it is hard to recommend the Blu-ray version simply for audio/video quality. The picture does seem brighter and more clear in high-def, but can be subtle during a good bit of the picture. Since much of it was filmed in the dark, it tends to look grainy at times. Daylight scenes look outstanding compared to the DVD though with the exception of the final sequence when Ash gets sent back to the medieval period. For some reason, that did not look too spectacular.
042521771X|3.0|I pre-ordered this and have been so looking forward to reading the POV of Mr. Knightley, unfortunately  he wasn't as captivating as the hero's in Mr. Darcy's Diary or even Captain Wentworth's.  He didn't have much of a sense of humor either.  I didn't feel much angst or sympathy for him  because his love for Emma didn't become apparent even to himself until more than 2/3 way through.  I felt Mr. Knightley was a more complicated character than what was conveyed here in this Diary.  Nonetheless, it is interesting and for those that want a quick reminder of Emma or just have to have all the latest Jane Austenesque novel, this book is worth the purchase and certainly will compliment any collection.  It's certainly not my favorite of Grange's diary novels but I liked it/not loved it.
B00068ULLY|1.0|I order it from a very unreliable seller,I never got the box-set. Just two DVD's in separate jewel cases and one was damaged.
B0000025JT|5.0|In good condition and arrived in a reasonable length of time.  Would buy from this seller again.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I've consistently worked out for more than 10 years, including my first pregnancy.  Her use of dynamic sequencing really does get you a good workout.  I like how well she describes the proper form of movement.  I really like the fact that the DVD provides a workout chapter menu- so you can skip whatever part of the workout to accommodate how much time you have.  Great stretch at the end.  My only complaint is that I wanted more upbeat music to get me going....she talks most of the way through the workout.
B000IOM0WO|1.0|The video is awful! Grainy, and dark. Blu Ray ought to be about pristine HiDef video, but this disc looks worse than most standard def DVDs. Although the audio quality is reasonably good, it should be PCM lossless instead of DTS 6.1. After all, the whole point of buying this disc in Blu Ray format is about superior sound quality and video quality. Neither were particularly impressive to me. I guess die hard U2 fans will happily shell out for the BD version, but I wish I had passed on this one. Oh well, hopefully Bon will use his cut for a worthwhile cause!
B000V8I2QU|1.0|I guess when you've been a bonified star for 35 years, you can do as you wish, but this is the last Bruce recording I'm buying site unseen...with production and recording standards like this, who needs enemies?    The songwriting is marginal at best...compared to Richard Thompson, John Hiatt, Dave Alvin, et al, Bruce's skills have deteriorated - it's no wonder this CD is being sold used right here on Amazon at 66% off list a week after its release, it's drival.    The only song that isn't significantly compressed and produced to death is the 12th cut which isn't even listed and I presume dedicated to his friend Terry Magovern-thankfully it was spared the producers and recording engineers hatchett.   Bruce or one of his handlers need to find SOMEBODY with a decent pair of ears...Rudy Van Gelder where are you when we need you most!!
0375842209|5.0|Wow.  First of all, my 12 year old daughter also read this book, and she cried for a while towards the end and after finishing it.  I was already reading it also, but having several books going at once, I kept putting it down, until finally on a Saturday afternoon I plowed through to the end.  So emotionally wrenching and heartbreaking, this book (and the book thief) deserves nothing less than your full and undivided attention.<br /><br />A story of loss, courage and love, the subject of this book, while written for the \\"young adult\\" audience, is very mature.  But it is  subject matter we all need to be reminded of so we never forget it.  The book thief is a young foster child, growing up with a new family after losing her parents to circumnstances surrounding the start of WW2 in Germany.  Not all Germans were blindly following Hitler, as Liesel and her neighbors stand up to do the right thing for their neighbors and themselves.  Her \\"Papa,\\" Hans, is a WW1 veteran, who is prevailed upon by the son of someone who he knew back then for help, and Hans does the right thing;  and then some.  Liesel's best friend, the lovely Rudy Steiner and his family are the same.  Brave people who know in their hearts what is wrong and right, and that listen to their hearts as well.  Fear is rampant, but these are brave, enduring souls.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the ending, but this is a book I am encouraging all my children to read, and I will also recommend it to my friends.  I will never forget Liesel, Rudy and the Steiner family, Max or Hans and Rosa.  A story with a bittersweet ending.
1582701709|5.0|This book is AMAZING! Brings you back to the true meaning of life and being on this earth. Back to a time when thoughts were pure and untarnished by hardened life experiences that jade us in the wrong direction. I recommend this book for EVERYONE who is looking for inner peace and happiness. It truely works if you work it!
0143038419|1.0|I picked this up at an airport while traveling and opened it on the plane.  I started rolling my eyes on the second page and pretty much didn't stop rolling them until I stopped reading.  This is basically the author's self-indulgent and clicheed 'search for herself' that reads like every other wealthy, overindulged 30 or 40-something woman's mid life crisis.     In the beginning she leaves her husband and marriage and indulges in a quick rebound relationship that (she will tell you, with some shock) did not work! Imagine. And then she decides to find herself by traveling to three geographical locations where she will indulge in some particular part of her inner self.      Along the way, she meets cardboard cut-outs.  Well, she will tell you that they are people, but they are more like a combination of character-composites and wishful thinking.  The old woman on the bench in the park who dispenses wisdom and then hobbles away into the mist.  The young Italian boy who - as he struggles to learn English - also dispenses wisdom beyond his years and points her further along her path.  If these were written as fictional characters you wouldn't believe them.  Written as real autobiographical experiences, they are cringe-makingly annoying.  And there are more of these 'characters' at every turn, she would have you believe!  Though for the record, I don't believe she meant them as an insult to the readers' intelligence.  Maybe she thought they were metaphors.    Anyway, her journey continues beyond Italy, and when I realized I had two more countries to visit with the author's angst and shallow self-discovery and pretend real people met with the express purpose of reflecting what she would like to 'learn' (lessons that most of us will have learned far earlier in life before more interesting lessons presented themselves) - I had to give it up.    I know it's categorized as autobiographical, but there's little reality or wisdom to be found here unless it is of a 'Cosmo's GuideTo Finding Yourself - see page 131 for details!!!' variety.  Actually come to think of it, it may have been perfect for that medium.
0316067598|1.0|Poorly written, right-wing garbage.  The story could have been so compelling but the author has to ruin it with the same type of dogmatic \\"god is on our side\\" BS that he was supposed to be there fighting against.
0143036742|1.0|I had heard only praise for this book. I started with high hopes, but after about the second chapter I already hated it.  For me, perhaps the most annoying thing about the writing, is the authors usage of explanatory details in parentheses. She uses them a lot, way way too much. It becomes annoying and stupid when the same joke about a big breasted Ukrainian or how someone pronounces English appears every other page in parentheses   As for the book allegedly being funny, I don't think I laughed once. The jokes are childish.   In the end, I have no idea how this book has won so much praise.
B000UCEJEQ|5.0|Annie is TIMELESS! Her voice unchanged and as beautiful as it has always been! Fans will love this album. It is smooth and melodically haunting at times. Great for older more mature listeners too!
B000P0J024|5.0|Finally - a chance for the next generations to appreciate the Wilburys.  Why this collection of music was unattainable for so long mystifies me but thank goodness it is here again.  The music sounds better than ever - no surprise there.  The DVD is like hitting the jackpot for a Wilburys fan. The fact that someone had the presence of mind to record this band putting this music together is a wonderful gift.  You'll be so happy to have this.  Thank you Olivia!
1582701709|1.0|Frankly, I expected something more astonishing, considering the excitement this book generated.  Like attracts like.  The Druids knew this; Wicca and the earth-based, Celtic forms of Paganism have never forgotten it.  Hardly a \\"Secret\\".
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I love this cd. It's very soothing and thoughtful. I listen to it when I'm feeling stressed, or I'm driving through heavy traffic. Plus, \\"Gravity\\" knocks my baby out like nothing else on this earth. She can be screaming and fussing like mad, but turn on that song, and she falls asleep within minutes. If I could personally thank him, I would.
B000URDEB0|3.0|If you have seen the DVD \\"End of Innocence\\" Toumas talks about how the concept and sound of the Band changed once they first heard Tarja Sing the songs they had started to write in the Beginning. He stated he voice was \\"Too Bombastic\\" for the softer celtic/folk direction they had planned, so they had to beef everything up and and alot more dynamics to the Songs to compliment her Voice. Well this CD \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is just that, very Dark and Passonate -but also VERY Heavy & Powerful! But the the problem is Annette has a very tradional sounding Voice,which sound beautiful in the softer sections of the Songs with just Key's and Orchestrations, but once the Guitars, Bass, and Drums kick in to high gear, the poor Lady gets buried alot of the times. I know alot of this could have been corrected in the mix and mastering done on the CD, but to me the bottom line is I think the band and songs on this CD are just to heavy to compliment her Voice. She doesn't have the natual projection and range that an Opera Singer has to project over just about anything, so they should have come down to her level, or chose a Vocalist that had the power to rise to that level. I'm not knocking Annette's ability, I just don't think she was a good choice if Tuomas wanted to continue with the dynamic classical/metal direction of the band and not go more mainstream with the Music to better suit her Voice.
1582701709|1.0|I was given this book as a gift by a very spiritual friend with wonderful intentions of giving me tools to recover from a difficult year.  This was the hardcover version.  I liked the size and format of this book.    My first red flag was the alleged expertise of the experts quoted throughout the book.  I like a lot of opinions from a lot of different places, but these expert opinion-givers used professional titles like: Personal Transformation Specialist, Visionary, Trainer in the Field of Mind Potential, Law of Attraction Specialist, Personal Empowerment Advocate, and Transformation Leader.  It was as if all of these people were playing  make-believe.      I wanted to know what their real credentials were.  Were they trained in the scientific method?  I got my answer when I read quotes like, \\"...it has been scientifically proven that an affirmative thought is hundreds of times more powerful than a negative thought.\\"  There seemed to be no real experts involved in the writing of this book.    The basic premise of The Secret is making the Law of Attraction work for you.  We do this by being clear on what we want, thinking and acting like we already have it, and being grateful for receiving it, even before we have actually received it.    But the Law of Attraction is a tricky thing.  Like attracts like, except that the Law of Attraction doesn't compute words of negation.  We're told that saying, \\"Don't speak to me like that,\\" actually means, \\"Speak to me like that.\\"    We are also told that, \\"Nothing can come into [our] experience unless [we] summon it with negative thoughts.\\" For example, we're told that food cannot cause us to put on weight unless we think it can.  Anything negative that happens we have summoned ourselves through negative thinking.      I found this idea troubling when applied to things like miscarriage, child abuse or childhood cancers.  Troubling because this theory says those babies asked for everything they got.  And what about 9-11 and Katrina?  Yup, she actually covers this and guess what.  We asked for it.  I guess that even with positive thoughts being 100 times more powerful than the negative ones, the negative stuff just keeps on happening.    Being a good sport, I selected 4 reasonable things that I wanted in my life.  I clarified my needs, wrote them down, acted as though I actually had these things and went about being grateful.  I focused and paid attention for negative thoughts or anything that might sabotage my success.  At the end of one month I did not have a single one of these four things.  What I DID have was a family that thought I was nuts for acting and talking as if these things  were real.    I am quite interested in the new field of Positive Psychology and Authentic Happiness. I also believe there is power in positive thinking and gratitude, two pillars of The Secret.  She just takes it way, way, way too far. If you are interested in positive psychology, pick up something by Martin Seligman, a real psychologist and perhaps a visionary as well, but skip this one.
0440238609|5.0|I am not at all ashamed to admitt that I am a 27 year old person, and I absolutly LOVED all of these books.  The author, Pullman, gives such colorful and imaginative explinations that I would actually find it HARD not to fall in love with the main character, Lyra, and her friend, Will.  Not to mention the scores of other colorful characters that fit into Lyra and Wills' adventures.  I found myself so atatched to Lyra and the other characters in this book that I actually shed a tear MORE THAN ONCE during my readings.  I highly recommend this seris of books not only for familys or the newly independent readers, but also for adults who like fantasy fiction books.  I have found myself thinking about these books and these characters long after I retired them to my library.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie has got to be one of the best 117 minutes to spend with. Will Smith delivers in this movie on the true story of Chris Gardner, a man in 1981 with a prospect of an uncertain future in San Francisco after his wife leaves him to raise their only child. It's a movie that features a roller coaster of emotions for those who watch it. It's refreshing to know that there is a positive ending to this true life story of a man who was an unpaid intern for a brokerage firm and later became a success story on Wall Street! Highly recommended film for everyone!

B000OLGCI4|4.0|Disney successfully weaved together several of Rudyard Kipling's original jungle stories into a fun-filled adventure for children and adults. Well-received and quite memorable, The Jungle Book is full of unforgettable characters and timeless songs, although it was unable to reach the level of emotion and passion that would later be perfected with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.<br /><br />Bagheera the panther finds an abandoned man cub in a basket and, against his better judgment, delivers it to some fellow wolves to raise as their own. The human child, Mowgli, grows to be a favorite amongst the jungle creatures. But with the news of the return of Shere Kahn, the human-loathing tiger, Bagheera and the others decide it's best if Mowgli is returned to a human village. The boy doesn't want to go, and runs off for adventures with Baloo the bear and King Louie the orangutan before realizing that the jungle really is no place for a human.<br /><br />The characters are very well-crafted and their designs are flawless. In fact, three of the characters were so popular that they were drafted into their own spin-off TV show, Tailspin. Baloo the bear, King Louie of the apes and Shere Kahn the Tiger became more personified versions of themselves in Tailspin, which was also a huge success. The character designs in The Jungle Book paved the way as templates for future Disney characters including many of those in 1994's The Lion King. Other notable aspects of the inspired animation include the voice casting of Kaa the snake, by Winnie the Pooh's Sterling Holloway, and Colonel Hathi, leader of the marching military-like elephants is voiced by Pat O'Malley.<br /><br />The animation in The Jungle Book is incredibly life-like and accurate. From Mowgli's carefree hopping about in the jungle, to Bagheera's lithe lunging from tree to tree, to Kaa's bouncy coils, it is evident that each new animated feature by Disney gets more precise and impressive.

B000H305U0|4.0|The cd is very good as already noted half the cd is or has been on the radio or tv and for good reason. The cd would have been a perfect 5 for me if it wasnt for Damn Girl and (Another Song) All Over Again those 2 me are the weaker \\"filler tracks\\" of the album.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Paul Verhoeven finally returns to the epic and violent style of filmmaking that he perfected with films like Robocop and Soldier of Orange. Set in World War II, the Dutch director has plenty of open ground to create dastardly villains, tragic heroes and an ill-fated, sweeping romance.<br /><br />In Nazi-occupied Holland, young Jewish girl Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten) is forced into hiding. When her cover is blown she receives help from the Resistance and attempts to travel to liberated territory, but disastrous events find her stranded and alone. Joining up with another Resistance group led by Gerben Kuipers (Derek de Lint), Rachel assumes the name of Ellis de Vries and agrees to spy on Gestapo leader Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch) in order to help plan an escape for several captured allies, including Kuipers' son. Seducing Muntze and working her way into the compound, Ellis slowly uncovers a conspiracy that reveals no one can be trusted and nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />The hardest concept to bear in Black Book is the theme that the heroine Ellis cannot escape the atrocities of war. Told as a flashback, which hurts the film in that the audience is all too aware of Ellis's fate, Black Book ensures that tragedy is always looming over every character. As a Jewish girl in World War II, Ellis struggles to help those she believes deserve freedom, while seeking activities that will keep her too occupied to recount the loss of her family. She fights deceit from nearly everyone, hatred from her allies, and witnesses ultimate sacrifices by her people, and then as a spy infiltrating the Nazis she encounters equally negative treatment. Always in the wrong place at the wrong time, it is trying on the audience that Verhoeven continues to place her on the losing side. With few wins for the \\"good\\" guys, the tone of the film is continually depressing.<br /><br />Disheartening perhaps, but also riveting, as each new challenge promises excitement, suspense, and the burning desire to find out what happens next. Ample foreshadowing permeates Black Book, and it masters one of the most rewarding tricks in film. In several early conversations, bits of seemingly random information are discussed between characters. At first glance, this appears to be filler discourse or merely character development - but later in the film, during climactic moments, that information is recollected and revisited. It's especially thrilling because the audience feels like they are \\"in the know\\" of a crucial plot device.<br /><br />Flawless acting all around makes Black Book an easy early contender for several 2007 awards. Carice van Houten is a strong lead and magnificently draws the audience into her world of constant torture and misfortune. But as the twisting plot is steadily unveiled, her tormented character becomes more appealing and interesting, and one of the finest performances of the year emerges. Sebastian Koch also turns in an exceptional performance as the Gestapo leader whose temperament and sympathy betrays him to the real villains. The Resistance members each possess a very different and contrasting demeanor as well, from the tormented Theo to the heroic Hans, and the moral conflicts present within each one enhances the intensity of the drama. As brilliant as the other portrayals are however, none overshadows van Houten's searing performance and her tumultuous plight will resound with the audience long after the film has ended.<br /><br />\\"You shouldn't be so trusting. Not in a time like this.\\" A haunting tale of love, deception, and betrayal, Verhoeven's Black Book mixes the horrors of war with the beauty of a condemned romance and the devastating struggle to survive in a world that has forsaken you. With an Oscar-worthy performance from Carice van Houten and a riveting journey not easily forgotten, Black Book is a must-see film from a seasoned director whose repertoire never ceases to amaze.<br /><br />- Mike and Joel Massiehappens next.

B000069HKH|5.0|I usually can take Bruce only in small doses, but I found myself playing this CD over and over again and singing along. It grew on me and I fell in love with the tunes.
0807126063|3.0|I only got two-thirds of the way through this book because, basically, it just kept spinning its wheels.  Also, the title character is 99% unsympathetic.  He's such a friggin' ego-centric dolt that I simply stopped caring about anything to do with him.  Yes, there are very funny parts...but not that many.  I really feel this book has been hyped due to the fact that the book didn't get published until twenty years after the author's death (he committed suicide at least partly due to the novel not being published in his lifetime) and that the persistence of his mother in getting it printed really added to the book's mystique...which, obviously, has NOTHING to do with the actual book itself.  I feel that the book would have never even been considered for a Pulitzer (which it won in the early '80s) had it been published in the author's lifetime.  I actually would give this book two and a half stars, but that option isn't available.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I won't bother describing the plot of this movie.  I just want to put in my 5 stars and say it deserved its awards and was funny as hell.

B000URDEB0|5.0|THE BAND: Tuomas Holopainen (keyboards, piano), Emppu Vuorinen (guitars), Marco Hietala (bass, vocals), Jukka Nevalainen (drums & percussion), Anette Olzon (vocals). Origin - Finland.<br /><br />THE DISC: (2007) 13 tracks clocking in at approximately 75 minutes. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing song titles/credits, song lyrics, numerous pages of artwork pertaining to songs, 2 band color photos, and thank you's. Recorded between Petrax (Hollola), Legendary E-Major (Kerava), Finnvox (Helsinki) and Abbey Road Studios (London). All music and lyrics written by Holopainen (except \\"Whoever Brings The Night\\" by Vuorinen, \\"The Islander\\" by Hietala, and \\"7 Days To The Wolves\\" by Holopainen & Hietala). The Passion Play Orchestra includes 26 violins, 13 violas and 14 cellos (and bass). The Metro Choir contains 42 voices, and an additional 12 members making up the Metro Gospel Choir. Album artwork by Janna & Gina Pitkanen. Label - Road Runner Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: It's usually tough replacing main members of a band. Exit singer Tarja Turunen; enter newbie Anette Olzon. Hardcore Nightwish fans might well dismiss newcomer Olzon, but they'll be missing out on one heck of an album. \\"Dark Passion Play\\" is grandiose in all aspects. There's nothing muddy about the production - whether you're listening to the heavy rhythm of the electric guitars, or the gentle acoustic moments - the sound is crisp to a fault. Jukka's drumming is once again flawless (his double-bass is the backbone of the band). The choir and vast orchestra fit beautifully in the background of every track. Olzon's vocals are a definite change of pace from Turunen's. Where Turunen leaned heavily on her operatic background, Olzon leans to the rock and pop side. But most importantly - it fits nicely and it works. The album opens with the near 14-minute stunning 5-section epic \\"The Poet & The Pendulum\\". The song begins with a soft orchestra joined by Vuorinen's trademark crunchy guitar riffs. In the middle of the \\"Pendulum\\" (section titled \\"The Pacific\\") is a delicate interlude highlighted by the choir soloist. Perhaps it would be more fitting to place this long melody at the end of the album. The band though choosing to lead off with it - a bold move to place this long piece in front as track 1. For me, \\"The Poet & The Pendulum\\" is the highlight of the album. \\"Dark Passion Play\\" features 3 singles released in Europe in - \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\", \\"Amaranth\\" and \\"Eva\\". All 3 songs are in the 4-minute range... the first two mentioned being nicely structured symphonic power metal tracks ready for the radio; the third (\\"Eva\\") a ballad showcasing Olzon's voice. Hietala takes lead vocal duties on 2 tracks - the heavy \\"Master Passion Greed\\" (perhaps my least favorite track on the disc), and the Jethro Tull-esque \\"The Islander\\" (a nice surprise - I never knew he could sing like this). \\"Last Of The Wilds\\" is a nice up and down instrumental (with an gracious wood winds section tucked neatly in the middle). The album finishes with two 7-minute power ballads... both great songs... though ending the disc on a somber note. Overall - a great album, though leaning to the mainstream side of the power/symphonic metal genre. If long time Nightwish fans can let go of Tarja and accept Anette Olzon... they will treasure this album as well as others to come (5 stars).he \\"Pendulum\\" (section titled \\"The Pacific\\") is a delicate interlude highlighted by the choir soloist.

B000SFZ05C|1.0|Whew!!!....Thank God that's over!!!!Man, I just had the worst dream ever!!! I was dreaming that my favorite band in the world, THE (friggin') CULT, put out this CD called \\"Born Into This\\"...It was like somebody said,\\" Hey, I want you guys to make 7 versions of the same bad song, and then purposely write the remaining songs to almost be good\\".....And, supposedly, this charlatan named \\"Youth\\" produced it...and he was acting like their friend and telling them this was cutting-edge modern rock and roll....And I was thinking that nobody would let them release something this terrible.....and.....and....wait a minute.....oh no.....THE HORROR........THE HORROR..............
0142002038|4.0|If you can get past the parts of the story about the pink spoonbills, or whatever those birds are called, you will see that Doctor No is one of the best novels in the Fleming series. The story starts off slow, but really picks up when Bond arrives on Crab Key. This is just full of adventure, great dialogue and Bond goes through one of his worst beatings in the last chapters of the novel. If you enjoyed the movie, then you will definitely like this 100 times more since it expands and tells more than the movie does, even going into why his name is Doctor No (which isn't his birth name). This is just a really good book that you won't be able to put down once the real action gets started, just be warned that there is a slow beginning.
B0009RP3ME|4.0|This Japanese import \\"With Teeth Limited Tour Edition\\" (ASIN: B0009RP3ME) includes the CD with the 13 original tracks plus the bonus track \\"Home\\" only! This does NOT include the tracks that other reviewers have mentioned (\\"The Hand That Feeds [Ruff Mix]\\" or \\"Right Where It Belongs [v2]\\"). The Amazon description does use the word \\"track\\", so I'm thinking the other reviewers may have reviewed the wrong product, unless I just somehow got screwed.

B000UJBYD8|4.0|I don't really get where people are all dissapointed with this album.  It's the Cult pure and simple.  Is it their best album? No....but is it better than 99% of the pure GARBAGE that the media and radio stations try to cram down our throats....YES!!!    I think many people are simply being WAY too knit-picky with the album due to the fact they have been waiting 6 years.  It seems like they feel they are owed another (fill in whatever Cult album you think is best).  IMHO, this album fits along just fine with all my other Cult albums.    If you are a Cult fan, and do NOT seem to suffer from a somewhat Star Wars-esque fanboy mentality where you knitpick a current project to one from '85 or so....pick this album up.  You will enjoy it.

B000VBIEXS|2.0|\\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" was ELP's undisputed masterwork.Released in December 1973,it hit #11 on the Billboard Album charts and it is home to some of the band's most popular and enduring songs:the gentle ballad \\"Still...You Turn Me On\\",the spellbinding hymn \\"Jerusalem\\",the Moog-fried classical-rock piece \\"Toccata\\"(an adaptation from Ginastera's 1'st Piano Concerto,4th movement)and the towering muti-part epic \\"Karn Evil 9\\".But unlike the previous ELP Shout! Factory remasters,this reissue's remastering of this album is an inept disaster.\\"Karl Evil 9(1st Impressions Parts 1 & 2)\\" is viturally unlistenable-the volume is so low and muffled you have to crank it up to 12 to hear it,and \\"Jerusalum\\" has a volume increase halfway thorough the track-very poor QC at Shout!Factory.  Unlike the others,however,it has two bonus tracks,one's an alternate mix of \\"Jerusalem\\",with Greg Lake's vocal more upfront than in the original mix,and an instrumental version of \\"Karn Evil 9: 1st Impression Parts 1 & 2\\".It also has a cool gatefold sleeve-opening design of the controversial H.R Giger album cover,a neat foldout poster of the trio containing lyrics,and a deluxe 24-page booklet with informative liner notes by Dave Thompson and rare photos of the band live in concert.I would advise fans of BSS,however, to hold to the Rhino CD version,which has none of the sound quality problems and has held up very well.(Updated:6/25/2010)

And like every Cult release, it is different from the last.<br />I'll admit, it didnt stick with me on the first listen, but by the third I was finding the hooks and now I think it is a good, solid CD.<br />If you expect the same sound from a very dynamic band every time they release something new, then you will probably not like this. If you like to hear something new and probably ahead of its time, then this CD will hit the mark. That's why it is called Alternative Rock. There are plenty of new angles on the tracks and enough classic rock sounds to make a listener appreciate it. Good, solid effort from one of the most underrated bands in rock.

B000TUXL2A|5.0|I think Mark Knopfler's real departure from the Dire Straits sound starts with Ragpicker's Dream.  From that point on he no longer felt obligated to include the mandatory upbeat Sultanesque rocker.    His last three solo records all have a very distinctive sound.  While you won't find any flashy solos, the music is beautiful, the sound is really warm and Mark Knopfler's signature guitar is still very much present.    Kill to Get Crimson contains a ton of beautiful melodies.  But what sets this album apart is Mark Knopfler's innovative but yet organic way of creating atmospheres.  Some of the arrangements found on Kill to Get Crimson are surprisingly edgy.    Get Springsteen for your highway driving and get this CD to sip your wine late at night.    I love this album.  I own all of Mark's recordings and this is probably his most introspective effort.  Not the most upbeat set of songs but simply stunning.  And finally, a Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits CD with a cover that actually looks good...  It was about time!
B000VT55G4|3.0|I've seen this same story line in several different movies, including old westerns.  But, it was worth watching on a Friday night.  The story was predictable and a little silly, I never did figure out why a normal guy would endanger his kid to bring a bad guy to justice.  However, it was cheap to download and was a lot better than a lot of movies I've rented from blockbusters.  Plus you don't have to worry about taking it back and getting charged with a late fee.
0753820250|5.0|I wasn't looking for deep thoughts, but for entertainment.  This book delivers, an engaging tale spiced with hidden family histories, dark secrets, and a tragic hero.  It finishes on an overly melodramatic note, building up to more of a climax and confrontation than was necessary. I'd deduct half a star, but not a whole one.
0061153923|4.0|I only recently discovered the writings of Neil Gaiman and am glad to add him to my list of favorite modern fantasy authors. I listened to the audio version of Stardust, which was narrated by Gaiman himself. While I'm a fan of audio books in general, I think a tale like this is especially appropriate to listen to, as it evokes the distant past of folk tales that predate the widespread use of written language. I have not seen the movie which recently came out, and, from what I've heard, am not anxious to see it.  It sounds like a typical Hollywood approach. I read in a review of the movie that Robert Deniro plays the captain  of a pirate ship who likes to dress in women's clothes. While the novel does have the pirate ship, this eccentricity on the captain's part is not in the book. This may not be very important,  but the fact that they invented this for the film seems to imply that the novel is not sufficiently interesting on its own, which is far from the case.<br /><br />Stardust is a fantasy that quite openly draws on many older tales, including traditional fairy tales, Celtic tales of faery, and even Shakespeare. In the audio version, there is a quite interesting interview with Gaiman, where he mentions the early, not very well known fantasy author Lord Dunsany. I actually recognized a passage in Stardust that was taken in tribute to this older author -referring to \\"the fields we know\\" (an often repeated expression in Dunsany's King of Elfland's Daughter), which denotes the everyday world as opposed to the lands of faery. This division between worlds is an important part of Stardust. The tale starts in the town of Wall, a rather ordinary town except for the fact that it is surrounded by an actual wall -on the other side are the magical lands. This idea of crossing into the Otherworld is a common theme is older tales, especially in the British Isles. What I like about Stardust is that Gaiman evokes many familiar themes from these traditions and still comes up with a very original story.<br /><br />The hero of Stardust is a young man named Tristan who, it turns out, has faery blood himself.

B00005JOHC|4.0|We just love the show 2 & 1/2 Men!! Great timing for them to release the series on DVD - we had just been discussing it was a series we'd love to have.  The one liners are just great!  Especially when we've had a rough day at work - popping in an episode of 2 & 1/2 Men gives us the comic relief we need!    Keep the seasons coming!
0385341067|5.0|Set with the background of a real (not fictional) civil war on a Pacific Island, the story unfolds in surprising ways. A diverse collection of characters who all contribute to the readers experience. I have recommended this book to many and even given five copies away. A great book for a book group.
B000002552|5.0|Truly an album of friends.  Nowhere in the Dylan canon is there anything approaching the affinity he had with the Band.  As the liner notes say, \\"a smile shoots across this entire album.\\"  This album is really a sabbath or a sabbatical, not in the sense of retirement from music, but more of an opportunity to suspend time, and search for their music rather then play songs for audiences night after night.
B000AWYOGE|3.0|Dark Water starring Jennifer Connelly had great potential as a psychological thriller but this film is a let down. First of all, the premise seems smart but by the end of the film I am confused by all the chracters never shown in the climax. Connelly is a wonderful actress and she is perfect for the part but I wish her character had more to do rather just puttering around the apartment all day. This film is not terrrible, it's just so-so. Decide for yourself on this one.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|Absolutely love 80% of it.  Favorites are 5:15 AM, Boom, like that, Song for Sonny Liston, Postcards from Paraguay and Don't crash the ambulance.  Could do without the slower pieces, but I can listen to the whole CD once a day.  So glad he does what he does.  One CD every 18 months.  Please keep it going, Mark.  Would love to hear you do an entire CD with spanish guitar.  Seems like you've mellowed over time and written better story songs, but your guitar riffs are what bring tears to my eyes.  Wife is now a big fan and I'm working on the kids.  They love your stuff too.
0525950079|5.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett's work, but know that most authors have occasional \\"duds\\", and at over 1000 pages (the British version I bought), I was concerned this would be a bloated, rambling disappointment.  I also loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" when I read it many years ago but had forgotten all but being fascinated by learning cathedral construction techniques, so I was hesitant to read a \\"sequel\\" in case this book was dependent on remembering the first one.   Still, because I read that this was a well researched and competent book, I decided to take a chance on it.      I am happy to report that my concerns were unfounded.  The book is long, but it has a lot going on and is not at all bloated.  There are several stories being told, but they all interweave and the elimination of one would be a loss. Although it is set in the same location and refers back to some of the original characters, reading or remembering \\"Pillars\\" is not required.   I enjoy learning about the construction and medical theories of the day and wish this aspect had been further expanded, but if a reader does not, there is not so much of it that it would be detrimental.     All in all, if you like historical fiction with plenty of death, love and destruction, this book is highly recommended.  The length of the book will dissuade some from trying it, but those who have longer attention spans will not be disappointed.
B000TSIK14|4.0|Not a bad cd...i think Scorpions earlier stuff is better though. Humanity is probably my fav track though.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|A majestic black panther named Bagheera comes across a human baby all alone in an Indian jungle. Concerned for the child's wellbeing, he delivers it to a family of wolves in the hopes that they will take him in as one of their own. They do, and the boy, Mowgli, grows up happily among the animals as a creature of the jungle. But when the ferocious, man-hating tiger Shere Khan returns to the area on a mission to kill the boy, Mowgli's animal friends must conspire to return him to the safety of the man-village from whence he came.<br /><br />Bagheera and Mowgli set forth on the long journey to the village and encounter some of Disney's greatest characters along the way. The best one being, without a doubt, Baloo the bear, who immediately adopts Mowgli after the boy discovers the purpose of his excursion with Bagheera and refuses to continue. Mowgli is happy where he is, and Baloo is all set to teach his new man-cub how to be a bear and live off the bare necessities. However, with such dangers as Kaa the hypnotic python, King Louie the would-be pyromaniac orangutan and his monkey troupe, and of course the menacing, deadly Shere Khan lurking about in search of the boy, even the carefree Baloo will have to take into consideration what is best for the child.<br /><br />Truly one of the finest Disney animated features of all-time, and possibly my favorite from Walt's day (though, that's a very tough call), \\"The Jungle Book\\" is a must have for anyone who loves Disney animation or just animation in general! This is still considered some of the finest character animation of all-time! And that's what \\"The Jungle Book\\" is all about, the characters! The plot is simple, no doubt about that. It's a road-trip through the jungle with survival being the key concern. There's more emotion and entertainment to it than you might think though, thanks to those outstanding character creations! This film has plenty of laughs and heart, and some of the best music you've ever heard (thanks to the Sherman Brothers, Terry Gilkyson, and George Bruns)! Wonderfully directed by Disney animation legend Wolfgang Reitherman, whose son Bruce was the voice of Mowgli, and guided by the master himself, Walt Disney, as the last animated feature he would personally oversee, \\"The Jungle Book\\" was deservedly an instant smash success! The virtually \\"living\\" animation and simple storytelling demonstrate Disney filmmaking at its best, and one of the songs (Bare Necessities) even earned an Academy Award Nomination! And for those who think casting big-name celebs in animated films detracts from the overall effect, it certainly didn't hurt this Disney Masterpiece! The cast roster includes such folks as Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, and even Clint Howard, among others! It was even intended to use the Beatles as the voices of the vultures, but I guess they felt they were bigger than Jungle Book. Oh well, I always preferred The Monkees myself! Though, this film features a different kind of monkey.<br /><br />Without a doubt, if you own a DVD player, you should own this DVD, and \\"The Jungle Book\\" has never looked better! This newly restored version, presented here in a widescreen format that gives us less on the top and bottom (but more on the sides) than the old, bare-bones release, looks and sounds great and is loaded with extras spread out over 2-discs. Before I get to the extras though, I know everyone is concerned about the aspect ratio thing. Well, there seems to be debate over whether Disney should have gone the matted route. Some say the film was intended to be cropped into a widescreen version for its theatrical release, some argue that it was not. Clearly, Disney should have included both options in this set, but my best advice is to not throw your Limited Issue \\"Jungle Book\\" DVD out if this is a problem for you. I probably will hang on to mine. Of course, most of you probably don't have the L.I. DVD, but whether you do or not, don't hesitateto pick up this newer edition. The picture, matted as it is, looks amazing, and the extras are so great. Sure, there could have been more. Disney has somewhat slacked off on the Platinum Editions most of the time in comparison to the initial Snow White release, but there is still a lot of must have stuff for the Jungle Book fan!<br /><br />In addition to the film itself, Disc One holds a wonderful audio commentary with Bruce Reitherman (Mowgli's voice and son of the film's director), composer Richard Sherman, and current Disney master animator and self-professed number one Jungle Book fan Andreas Deja. Archival recordings of animators who worked on the film are also played during the commentary, and it all adds up to one very informative and enjoyable, even touching experience. The first disc also includes the \\"Music and More\\" section, which holds your standard, cheezy Disney Channel teen update video, this one being the Jonas Brothers performing \\"I Wanna Be Like You,\\" and a set of three sing-along song selections from the film, as well as two other far more fascinating features. These are a group of audio selections of deleted songs from a very different version of the film that Walt felt was too dark for a Disney animated feature, and a deleted character/scene of a dim-witted rhino named Rocky put together in voiced storyboard format. The deleted scene is quite interesting to watch, especially with its more Beatle-esque version of \\"That's What Friends Are For,\\" but overall it's not something that you'll regret having been cut. The deleted songs, on the other hand, are a bit more substantial and bring to mind the much earlier, live-action \\"Jungle Book\\" film starring Sabu. Besides all that great stuff, there is a promo for the Disney Wildlife Worldwide Conservation Fund, and the disc is also enhanced with Disney Fast Play for the kiddies.<br /><br />Disc Two features the bulk of the extras, of course, the main one being the expected \\"Making-Of\\" featurette, \\"The Bare Necessities: The Making of The Jungle Book.\\" This is an excellent 46 and half (or so) minute featurette full of great interviews and with a really tear-jerking section that goes into Walt's death during the making of the film. It really is a captivating watch, and it can be viewed in sections if one chooses. Other featurettes include a first-rate comparison between Disney's version of the film and the original works of Rudyard Kipling, \\"The Lure of the Jungle Book,\\" in which we get to see modern animators reminisce about what \\"The Jungle Book\\" has meant to them and their careers, \\"Mowgli's Return to the Wild,\\" a featurette about Bruce Reitherman's current life as a nature filmmaker and his reflections on his father, and finally \\"Frank and Ollie,\\" which is not the feature-length documentary of the same title available on its own DVD, but rather a brief carry over from the Jungle Book laserdisc previously referred to as \\"Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston Discuss Character Animation.\\" Besides the featurettes, there is one more group of extras that falls under the heading of \\"The Man Village\\" (as Disc Two is divided into two sections), and that is the Art Galleries. These are what you have come to expect from Disney Platinum releases and are all very appreciated by us Disney animation fanatics, of course. The other section of Disc Two falls under the heading of \\"Jungle Fun,\\" and, to be honest, it's mostly just for the kids, though I do like the Disneypedias. The bulk of the section is 4 games that can be played as one long game, but I had trouble playing them on my player (which probably has more to do with the player than the disc) and I wasn't too interested anyway. I'd rather have trivia games if anything. There's also some sort of English teaching game that is separate from those others. Now, that was in interesting inclusion. I think it could work to teach any kids the names of animals though. As I said, there is a Disneypedia in this section, which is sort of likeedition. The picture, matted as it is, looks amazing, and the extras are so great. Sure, there could have been more.

I think it could work to teach any kids the names of animals though. As I said, there is a Disneypedia in this section, which is sort of like a Disney-fied Animal Planet program(running just under 15 minutes). Here, we get to see and learn about the real animals and locations from the film, and while it's aimed at kids too, it can also be enjoyed by adults.     While the DVD extras do lack any theatrical trailers for the feature itself and movie poster art in the gallery section, this still adds up to a fantastic, must-own DVD, as are all the Disney Platinum Edition releases. I suppose that's the real reason why Disney hasn't been putting as much into them as they could lately. Even with less content than the earlier Platinums, they still are amazing sets, especially compared to the original, bare bones releases. \\"The Jungle Book\\" was released in 1967, by the way, almost a full year after Walt's death. It is inarguably one of his greatest achievements. In 2003, Disney released an all new sequel to theaters, \\"The Jungle Book 2.\\" Despite what most hardcore Disney fans would say, I feel there was great potential in a sequel to the '67 classic. We still hadn't seen what life was like for Mowgli in the Man-Village, and here was the opportunity. Unfortunately, as with most of the sequels to Disney classics, the film was made strictly with a child audience in mind, and it didn't meet its full potential. Also, some great characters weren't included and colors were just plain wrong. It was a theatrical release that looked more like a better-than-average direct-to-video release. While it's not without a certain level of entertainment value, most adult viewers will probably only find merit in this original Masterpiece. If you have to have more of Baloo, Louie, and Shere Khan though, you might first want to pick up the 1990 television series \\"TaleSpin\\" on DVD. That is, if you don't mind Baloo being transformed into a 1930's aviator in a world of anthropomorphic animals, ha. It really is a wonderful show. There was also a later program more loyal to the Jungle Book setting but featuring the main animal characters as children. It was called \\"Jungle Cubs,\\" and it was a cute show for the younger set, but it's still not available for purchase. Various live-action Jungle Book films also exist (both by Disney and other studios), and there is a fine cartoon short by Chuck Jones entitled \\"Mowgli's Brothers.\\" Of course, the 1967 Disney animated classic is as good as it gets!
B0002NRRAG|5.0|My neighbors introduced me to Madeline Peyroux's music and I was enthralled. She has a retro quality to her stylings that evoke a time when people used to get dressed to go out. If you're having people over or just a nice quiet evening at home with some wine, cheese and fruit (and that special someone) you can't miss with this. Her other offerings that I particularly like are Dreamland and  Half the Perfect World. Thanks, Mark & Linda!
B000HT3P7E|5.0|When I first read the premise of this show, I wondered how they could make a series out of that.  Then on the pilot you learn that Robin is not the girl Ted marries.  This is going to be a long story!  I'm happy I bought the Season 1 DVDs.  There were some shows I missed and saw for the first time and most of the episodes are so clever and funny they can be watched repeatedly.  Don't be surprised to see something funny you missed the first or second time you watched it.  The cast works so well together on this clever, fast moving and sophisticated comedy.  They're all likable, particularly Josh Radnor as Ted.  The stand outs are cute, perky Alyson Hannigan as Lily and, of course, Neil Patrick Harris as the confirmed bachelor and always natty \\"wing-man\\" Barney.  So suit up and get into the best comedy on TV right now.
B000KGGLCU|2.0|The sound systems used for this tour are top-notch on just about every track, including the DVD bonus. Then again, they need to be; the \\"artist\\" is usally lip-synching or just adding her thin, reedy voice to a backing-track.    In some respects, you have to hand it to Madonna (or rather to the industry \\"image handlers\\" she's had throughout her career, packaging & repackaging her, coming up with her \\"ideas\\" for her). The woman has made her fame & fortune with virtually no discernible or noteworthy \\"talent,\\" and this collection from the tour to support her most recent album is a testament to that.    She can still dance with enthusiasm, if a rather mechanical grace, but this collection of recent songs was among her most bland. The DVD is worth it for Madonna hard-core types, but the only album any rational adult might ever want or (remotely)\\"need\\" from this \\"artist\\" is 'The Immaculate Collection,' which captures the best of what she did best--sing chirpy, bouncy, ear candy. Everything else has gotten very very tired...a long time ago. This overkill money-grabber \\"tour CD\\" (and DVD) is proof, though Madonna collectors will not want to miss out on it; as far as toss-away \\"tour of a recent album\\" retrospectives go, this is actually filmed and put together very well.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I loved paramores first CD but didn't get around to listening to her last songs, even though i had the CD for a year. But this CD was the best the more and more i listened the better it got. Usually songs on CD's go from good to bad so no one listens to the last songs, but i loved every song. I still always have some song by them stuck in my head from listening to it so much in the summer. Buy it, it's worth every penny.
B000063Y8F|1.0|While i do own several rosle pieces in my kitchen, this is not constructed like anything else that i own.  on the first piece of garlic that i tried to press, the unit simply was destroyed.  the spot-weld at the fulcrum snapped off, causing everything to misalign and bend beyond repair.  if you order this, good luck, as this is a manufacturing problem from the factory and is probably going to happen to you as well.
B0006284JQ|1.0|Britney Spears seriously has to go. No one likes her, we all just love looking at her and thinking we have the most well put together life. All she is good for is making the tabliods money and giving celebrities a bad name. Oh and she sucks at singing.
B000H305U0|5.0|First off I am not a huge fan of JT and bought the CD last year when it first came out... didn't even like \\"Sexyback\\" truth be told (due to the radio stations playing it so much) and I can't even recall what made me purchase it in the first place LOL<br /><br />That being said I must say that when I got it I played it OUT!! I was so surprised at how many jams were on the CD. Listened to it day and night, at work, at home while cooking, gardening, reading told everyone I spoke with about it since I was like BLOWN away. Had several favorites from the \\"GET\\" and man I just couldn't wait for the radio stations to catch up with the ENTIRE CD because they were still playing \\"Sexyback\\" and as time went by and I would hear more singles released and played on the radio my smile was broad and my ears delighted that some of my favorites made it to the radio waves. Timberland and JT did a AWESOME job on this CD with mixing up slow jams (that will move you to close your eyes and nod your head) and dance music that will make you run out to the dancefloor at a club. With the exception of a few songs this CD is solid and I have this thing that if I like if out of a 12 songlist CD I like over 8 of them that is pretty dang good! For the record my faves are:<br /><br />1. Until the end of Time<br />2. Lovestoned<br />3. My Love<br />4. Future Sex/Love Sounds<br />5. Losing My Way<br />6. All Over Again<br />7. Summer Love<br />8. What Goes Around (the remix version)<br />9. Sexyback<br /><br />Respectfully Reviewed
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|The song Blackbird is worth the price of this cd alone.  A real classic.  This band has matured.  I can't believe the nucleus of this band used to be Creed.  They don't sound anything like Creed anymore.  Myles Kennedy has brought a real punch to this band.
1582701709|1.0|I'm just adding this review to try to bring down the rating.  Seriously, how did this steaming pile of .... rate 3 1/2 stars?  If I could rate it a negative, I would.  Not only is \\"The Secret\\" worthless, it's actively harmful.
B00009P1O5|4.0|Rock from true believers. This is the testament of a garage band with the door open on a hot summer night kicking out the jams for the parents to cringe and the kids to party. Neil and Crazy Horse toured with this album 10 years after it was released. Sonic Youth opened. 'Nuff said.
B000UR366S|5.0|I've been a Joni Mitchell fan for almost 40 years and to say that I was looking forward to the release of this record would indeed be an understatement. From the first listen I knew that this was another Joni classic. Her voice is in fine form (sure, she can't hit the high notes any more, but she makes up for it in her phrasing, pronunciation and delivery-think Frank Sinatra or Billie Holiday in the later years of their career). The music is beautiful and features Joni on piano on many of the songs. The instrumentation is, of course, top notch with Larry Klein on bass, Greg Leisz on petal steel, Bob Sheppard on alto and soprano sax and jazz impresario Brian Blade on drums. As we've come to expect, Joni provides the rest of the music via synthesizer which gives it a fuller and broader sound. Topics include the rapidly declining state of the environment, the stupidity and greed of big business, the war in Iraq and the toll these horrors are taking on people's everyday lives.   Lyrically, Joni is right on the money, describing the anger, confusion, resignation and futility that many of us feel about the state of our world. There is no preaching here, just the expression of truth, albeit in an eloquent way that I could never myself articulate. There is a catharsis in just hearing Joni acknowledge these truths and ultimately, a glimmer of hope as Joni tells us, against all odds, we'll be OK if we just keep up the fight. It's the belief in miracles. It's \\"the thing with feathers.\\"  When the last song ends, I feel like we can stop all this foolishness after all. This is just a beautiful record from start to finish and I give it an unequivocal 5 star rating.    To Joni fans, I say keep on supporting her and buying her records. You will not be disappointed in this one for sure. There isn't a false note here.    To young people unfamiliar with her work, I say give this a listen. In today's musical environment, where the worst crap is heralded as great music, this record has something to say and does so in great style. This is beautiful, intelligent music for thoughtful people.     To Joni, I say thank you. Please do not give any more thought to retirement and please don't make us wait another 10 years for new music.   You mean a tremendous amount to those of us who are listening. We need to take inspiration from you and we need your observations on our world in our lives. Most of all Joni, this world needs your heart.
B000002A3T|5.0|I have been a Floyd fan for ages and this stands out as one of my favorite floyd albums along with DSOTM,WYWH,WALL,ANIMALS etc. Gilmour is simply great in this with some great guitar-work. very highly recommended. I really love this - does not matter really if Roger Waters is there or not. The Pulse concert we watched at Earls Court, London in 1994 was full of songs from Division Bell and it was really mind-blowing.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I thought the album was very good. \\"Girls in there summer cloths\\" was my favorite, close behind\\"Who will be the last to die\\", followed by \\"Gypsy Biker\\", The song \\"Magic\\" is haunting. I thought the different production was a welcome change. Bruce's voice was much clearer. All in all it is a very good album, not great  but very good.  Don't listen to the Bush loving Trolls who never listened to the album.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Alter Bridge, consisting of Myles Kennedy and three former members of Creed (Mark Tremonti, Brian Marshall and Scott Phillips), splashed onto the scene in 2004 with [[ASIN:B0002IU988 One Day Remains]]. Their debut turned out to be a welcomed one, for Mark Tremonti, lead guitarist, was able to showcase his guitar talents even more so than he was able to do whilst confined to Creed. For those looking for another showcase, Blackbird will be a treat. For newcomers, expect something not quite rock `n roll, certainly not nu metal, but just solid modern rock. While the debut was successful (it is certified gold) but not epic, one may perhaps see a hindrance in success the second time around. Hopefully this is not the case, for the sophomore effort is even more impressive and should draw a larger fan base in a perfect world.<br /><br />Sure, Alter Bridge are a radio-friendly band, but their two albums incorporate innovative riffs, lyrics with legitimate emotion, and the icing on the cake - guitar solos. Blackbird is a composition of thirteen songs (the UK version actually has a bonus track, \\"We Don't Care At All\\"), which arguably could be labeled \\"cookie cutter\\" rock anthems. One might compare the style to Nickelback for the catchiness or possibly Thornley's debut, [[ASIN:B000228EPO Come Again]], for the heaviness. Some songs feature tasty hooks and licks, while others explore melodies and beautiful sounds. Tremonti puts on another show yet again, still delivering the riffs and exceptional solos. With his talent, fans would probably welcome an instrumental album of some kind if he chose to pursue it. Kennedy's vocals sound more loose and flavorful than the first time around, and this could be the result of becoming more comfortable with his new band mates. Individual efforts aside, Blackbird is overall solid rock and ranks as the better of the two albums.
B000IU3XTM|1.0|I adored O. Absolutely adored it. Beautiful, sweeping melodies that brought me to my knees they were so amazing.     This release is insanely disappointing. He's trying to reach the same emotional heights he did during O but he's trying too hard. Simply singing softly and strumming the guitar don't make the emotions real. These songs lack the depth and brutal honesty of O's songs. And, worse yet, he doesn't venture out into new territory to at least give him high marks for trying something a bit different.    What's aboslutely maddening about this album, too, is that you have to be sure that when you listen to it, you are able to be w/in reach of the volume button at all times. The album goes from a maddening \\"was that silence or was there a soft voice there\\" to \\"CAN YOU TURN THAT DOWN, I'M GOING DEAF\\" in the span of about 20 seconds.     And what is EVEN MORE ANNOYING is all that hidden space/hidden track at the end. For the love of God, can artists QUIT DOING THIS????? It's got to be the most annoying aspect of CDs.     Hugely, hugely disappointing release. He's become a very bad cover version of himself.
0765348276|3.0|I picked this book up at my library because the first line really caught my attention.  The whole book was well written and seemed like it could really happen. (at least, if we could travel through space!)    This would have been a four star book,(not five stars because it's not a book that I would read over and over.) I gave it a three, however because it was crude with quite a lot of bad language.  Most of it went with the story, but I still found it disturbing.    I would have pursued the sequal, but didn't because I didn't want to be exposed to more sex and bad language.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Okay, so it's now official. Creed is dead, and Alter Bridge is here to stay.    Back in the summer of 2004, when AB's major-label debut \\"One Day Remains\\" was released, a lot of folks wrote these guys off as Creed clones or wannabes, merely because 3/4 of the band is made up of ex-members of Creed. And while some Creed-like sounds were present on that disc, on the whole it was fresh and exciting music from a completely different band. Guitarist Mark Tremonti was permitted to play in a fashion he never had before during his Creed days and the rhythm section, comprised of drummer Scott Phillips and bassist Brian Marshall (who actually left Creed before their 2001 release \\"Weathered\\"), really showed off its A-game. However, the true ace in the hole for these guys was new frontman Myles Kennedy, of Mayfield Four fame. With vocal range and passion that Scott Stapp couldn't  match on his best day, Kennedy slowly emerged as a voice to be reckoned with in modern rock. The band had a few semi-successful singles in the form of \\"Open Your Eyes,\\" \\"Find The Real,\\" and \\"Broken Wings\\" (as well as WWE wrestler Edge using \\"Metalingus\\" as his entrance theme), but on the whole it seemed as if they couldn't escape from Creed's shadow. And although One Day Remains was certified Gold, the band's future didn't look too bright, as they remained unheard from for the better part of nearly three years.    Enter their Universal-Republic debut, just released today: Blackbird.    How does it sound? Well, to be perfectly honest, *much* better than the debut. These guys have clearly matured a great deal musically. Gone are almost any traces of the Creed sound that \\"remained.\\" (No pun intended.) I suspect that a lot of that has to do with the fact that frontman Kennedy actually participated in the songwriting this time around, whereas the songs on One Day Remains were almost all Tremonti's work. And speaking of Mark, damn...how about those solos on this disc?! The man continues to push his own creative boundaries and make Alter Bridge's second release rock even harder than the first. Having only had this album for about four hours, I haven't had a significant opportunity to listen to it enough for it to sink in, but so far I like, no, *love* what I hear. Thus far, my favorite tracks are \\"Come To Life,\\" single \\"Rise Today,\\" \\"White Knuckles,\\" and of course the epic, near eight-minute long title track dedicated to the memory of a friend of the band.    On a side note, the copy of Blackbird that I purchased from Wal-Mart included not any bonus track(s) but rather a bonus DVD, featuring interviews with Kennedy, Tremonti, and Phillips (and to a *much* lesser extent Marshall) about the songs and creation of the new album.     Take heed, rock fans. With Blackbird, this reviewer feels that Alter Bridge will finally get the respect they deserve.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Few would dispute that Steven King is one of the (if not the) greatest writer of the Horror genre.  Even fewer (if any) could dispute that he is probably the most successful horror writer of all time.  His books, with rare exceptions, have been best-sellers and any of which individually could have provided him a lucrative career by themselves.    What hasn't had the same amount of acclaim and/or success (artistic and financial) for Stephen King are the film and television adaptations of his novels.  There is an inherent limitation that applies to both.  Due to the vast volume of material in the thick novels, feature-length films are limited by running time (and sometimes budget) as to the amount of story content they can afford to show.  And due to the graphic and disturbing nature of the stories, much of the content would have to be edited out for broadcast as a (non-cable) television mini-series.  Where he could find the best setting for his books to be viewed would be as a premium channel mini-series on cable television, where the content would not have to be restricted nor limited by the amount of broadcast time.  Similarly, some of his shorter stories have been made into decent films (NIGHT FLIER as one example).    For those who are not familiar with the plot of CARRIE, it tells the story of Carrie White, a socially handicapped and emotionally fragile high school girl who is besieged by cruelty and degradation in virtually every aspect of her life.  At school she is the target of sadistic popular girls who viciously bully her.  At home, she is unceasingly abused at every opportunity by a mentally unstable and psychologically imbalanced mother who additionally is also the tired cliché of religious zealot/sociopath (played by the inveterately over-acting and increasingly typecast Piper Laurie).   This cycle of almost unrelenting torment and humiliation and abuse begins to dangerously mount upon the psyche of a marginally stable Carrie, who also happens to havetelekinetic powers.  I will limit my comments about the storyline to avoid spoilers for anyone who hasn't seen it or read the book.     Anyhow, CARRIE was the first film adaptation from King's immense list, and it was fairly successful, doing decent business at the box office back then.  It was certainly better than the languid sequel and tepid remake that have followed.  Taking into consideration the technical (special effects) limitations of the time (1976), the film is competently and ably shot, effectively creating a palpable sense of atmospheric creepiness infused with an undertone of eerie desperation which permeates the film's ambiance from start to finish.  Another aspect that makes this film memorable is some Great (though brief) Nudity in the beginning of the movie, and the chance to see Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, and P.J. Soles back in their younger days.  Though they are still attractive women, they were total scorching HOTTIES back during then.  It also features a much younger Edie McClurg (the secretary from FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF) and a then-relative newcomer named John Travolta in an attempt to depict them as high school students.    CARRIE (the original film) is generally regarded as a better movie than many of King's other book-to-film adaptations, which are otherwise often considered by his fan-based audiences as being varying degrees of relative disappointment for a variety of reasons that range from falling short of the heightened expectations that many had for a film derived from highly regarded books, to being deprived by time limitations that force the film's content to be less-than-ideally abridged, to just plain being a crappy movie in a few cases.  Though it would also depend on one's personal preferences and favorites coming into play.  It would likely be a fruitless and futile endeavor to try and get a consensus - let alone a decisive majority - as to which of King's works would be ranked or recognized as being the best and/or favorite,even from among his fans.  In terms of film adaptations, the best bet might probably be THE SHINING.      Although this movie may not be the most technically advanced achievement (it is over thirty years old, and did not attempt any groundbreaking innovations even back then), and though it might not sate the most explicit gorehounds among the horror fan sub-demographic, it has the skillful competence and evokes visceral sensations that makes a horror film worth seeing.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a rare and remarkable woman, someone who has achieved success, and a measure of fame, despite the odds that origin and circumstance stacked against her.  Her intimate autobiography, Infidel, explains how she became a determined feminist because of, not despite, her upbringing in a Muslim culture in which women have few rights and little value compared to the males in their world.<br /><br />Born into a family situation in which her father took several wives, although each maintained a separate household, Ali did not see much of her father for long periods and was raised by her more religiously tolerant grandmother and mother.  Even as a girl, she found herself questioning authority and some of the basic tenants of her religion while still striving to do the things that were expected of her.  Ali learned exactly what those expectations were.  Circumcised as a young girl and educated by radical imams, she soon learned that by so much as uncovering her hair in public she would be solely responsible for whatever reaction she received from any male she encountered.  She learned that the Koran was to be taken literally as the direct word of Allah and that it could never be questioned even when it seemed to justify the beating and killing of women by husbands, brothers or fathers who believed them to have disgraced the honor of the family or clan.<br /><br />She tried very hard to internalize all that she was taught, but Ayaan Hirsi Ali was born with a questioning mind and could never reconcile herself to the fact that she felt much of what she was taught to be unjust.  And when she saw an opportunity to escape and make a new life for herself she took it.  While in Germany to arrange for the paperwork to join her new husband in Canada, the result of an arranged marriage set up by her father, she took the opportunity to flee to Holland where she sought and received refugee status.<br /><br />What Ali accomplished in Holland is the most amazing part of her story.  She learned the Dutch language so well that she was able to support herself as a translator rather than having to depend on the Dutch welfare system.  She went to university and received a degree.  She was granted Dutch citizenship.  And, most amazing of all, she was elected to the Dutch parliament.<br /><br />Never afraid to speak her mind despite the danger of doing so, Ali spoke loudly about the plight of Muslim women forced into arranged marriages who suffered beatings and, on occasion, honor killings at the hands of either their new husbands or their own family.  When Dutch film director, Theo van Gough, who collaborated with her on a film documentary about the abuse of Muslim women within the confines of their religion was murdered on the street, she was forced into hiding, almost had her Dutch citizenship stripped from her, and eventually moved to the United States for her own safety.<br /><br />Ali states her beliefs and goals very simply: \\"...the Quran is an act of man, not of God.  We should be free to interpret it; we should be permitted to apply it to the modern era in a different way, instead of performing painful contortions to try to recreate the circumstances of a horrible distant past.  My intention (is) to liberate Muslim minds, so that Muslim women - and Muslim men, too - might be freer.  Men, too, are forced to obey inhumane laws.\\"<br /><br />Is this really a crime for which she and others should be killed?he Dutch language so well that she was able to support herself as a translator rather than having to depend on the Dutch welfare system.

0316067598|5.0|The fact that US military personnel must consider being courtmartialed/jailed for making a sudden decision of who is an enemy combatant and whether to shoot a potential \\"costumed\\" enemy or risk getting onself killed within a few seconds or hours is in itself absolutely ridiculous, and totally unfair to our troops.  Who created rules of engagement for US troops?  Check the facts with the US Congress, and political giberish in general.<br /><br />We tried playing the politically-run rules of engagement within our military in Vietnam, and it definitely was a disasater, with millions of Vietnamese being murdered upon our sudden departure, and hundreds or thousands of Amerians being killed or wounded daily during that war.<br /><br />I'm sure all terrorists and America haters really get a laugh out of our foolish rules and media leaks that make our troops' vulnerability levels even worse.  I was saddened and angry at the minimal to zero publicity in the major new media about the Seals in LONE SURVIVOR. Mark miraculously survived, of the 4 Seals who unexpectedly had to fight hundreds of Taliban, but Seal Mark's major effort to get something done about the US rules of engagement in warring situations has not been altered to benefit our military. Mark will live with the horrible deaths of his three lost Seal team members for years.<br /><br />Wake up America.  Our troops need the freedom to do what is right, according to each situation. USA Rules of Engagement while dealing with sabreslashing, unpredictable terrorists who have NO rules of engagement, except to kill as many Americans as possible AND with no rules as to how  deaths or torture occur, is just preposterous.<br /><br />Let's contact our Congressmen and get the \\"rules\\" changed so our military can fight this war with their own good judgment.
B000001ESF|5.0|This is part one a comprehensive four part series of Reviews of the music of the Progressive Rock band Rush.  When a band has been around as long as RUSH has (30 years), their styles will change just as their clothing and hairstyles.  I group the bands first five releases into what I call \\"Early RUSH\\".  These albums are: Rush I (1974), Fly By Night (1975), Caress of Steel (1975), 2112 (1976), and All the World's a Stage \\"Live\\" (1976).<br /><br />Rush's forth album entitled \\"2112\\" was the bands early breakthrough album.  The album flat-out Rocks!  Especially the multi-part, thematic, epic, title track \\"2112\\", a 20 plus minute story set in the future where a Utopian society lives without music or any individual freedom of expression.  Frankly, when this was recorded, the boy's were angry and it shows.  2112 is full of energetic angst.  It also shows off Neil's drumming ability...again, along with Alex's powerful guitar work and Geddy's excellent bass lines.  Rush gained legions of fans over this one.<br /><br />The second side (opps!) er... the other songs are a little weaker, A Passage to Bangkok is memorable and my favorite, Something for Nothing, is a rocker.  The epic 2112 is worth the admission price alone.  This album has become a progressive rock classic that any serious 70's rock music collection cannot be without.<br /><br />Best Tracks: 2112 and Something for Nothing
B000W4WF02|5.0|I found this at Best Buy, so I was like what the heck?  A nice metal case with a special bonus disc, It's very cool if you are a Tarantino lover.  The bonus disc has at least 25 minutes of footage featuring cool facts about both Grindhouse halves, spoken from Rodriguez & Tarantino.  I found this DVD to be a nice package.  Hope you do too!
B000SZLSB2|5.0|This is a great cd, I think it is better than the first one. Blunt sounds more mature and the lyrics are very touchy.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I'm listening to this cd as I write and so far this is blowing me away.  If you loved their first release this will kill any doubt you might have that Alter Bridge's sophomore release would be less than spectacular.  This cd will seal that the past is behind them and they are doing better than with Scott Stapp as their front man.  Myles is much more dynamic and far reaching with his vocal ability than Stapp ever was.  You can definitely tell here that this cd has come together as a group effort because it flows so well together.  The songs are from the group and not leftover's from the days of Creed (see ya Scott).  The sound is like their first but far more their own this time around, thus extending their distance from Creed.  Personally, for me, it took me a while to really appreciate their first cd because you were just so tuned into Creed and expected that going forward without Stapp.  But after many listens 'One Fine Day' is constantly in my play mix.  Trust me, this will be too.  The addition of Myles on guitars just adds to the group's overall sound and what they can do.  If you're looking to get this you will not disappointed.  Make sure you find the special edition with the two additional bonus tracks - 'The Damage Done' & 'New Way to Live'.  A great addition to your music library.  And I will agree with one other reviewer that the song 'Blackbird' is worth the price just for the song itself (but every song is a great listen).

In My Opinion, Anyone Who Takes A Chance To Do What They Want Despite What Anyone Else Thinks About It Is Truly A Rockstar! Especially When You've Established A Great Fan Base And Record Lables Love You! However, I Am Dissappointed About This CD. Still,Im Honoring Her Bravery To Make Such A Risky/Daring Move! Thats One Positive Thing I'll Say Although I Agree With Just About Everyone Elses Review Of The Record. I Simply Had To Find Something Positive About It And Thats What I Came Up With. She Took A Chance,Broke A Leg, Jumped Off A Cliff...She LIVED!.

If You're Looking For A Good Pop/Rock CD Get Kelly Clarkson's \\"My December\\" You'll Have Way More Luck With That.    Thanx
B000002UJQ|4.0|And other such turn-of-the-last-century claim jumper neo....what would you call that?  Neophrasism?  Eh.  Either way, this record, and Radiohead in general, is a very, very difficult area to deal with, but I'll give it my best shot.    The world of popular rock - or, at the very least, alternative rock - is sort of divided into two camps these days.  The first are people who love Radiohead.  And I don't mean love Radiohead as in, \\"Man, I can't wait for these guys' next album!\\"  I mean love Radiohead in a sort of creepy, inappropriate touching, long sessions with a therapist kind of way.  There is a significant and vocal contingent of the alternative rock fanbase that honestly believes that Radiohead can do no wrong.  This naturally inspires skepticism in me, and also gives rise to the other group of fans - the fans of hating Radiohead.  People who think very rationally that Radiohead has, if not murdered members of their immediate family, committed crimes roughly on par and should be verbally excoriated at every possible opportunity.    The good news for sanity is that both of these groups are wrong.  The bad news is that they make navigating the whole universe of Radiohead very, very hard to do for somebody who, like me, has never listened to them before in his life.  Which isn't an uncommon group, I might add, as their contributions to the radio environment dried up pretty well after The Bends and since then they've been sort of absent from the popular music radio scene.    So, let's talk about OK Computer, and Radiohead in general.  For those who aren't initiated (and I'm going to assume that's who's reading, because while I'm sure the rabid fanbase and the equally rabid un-fanbase will be happy to trawl through these things looking for people with whom to agree and disagree, they won't derive much use from the review) - Radiohead is sort of like a cross between Pink Floyd and R.E.M., at least at this stage of their career.  They share a lot of R.E.M. sonic sensibilities (don't ask me to quantify it, but the guitars and arrangements just remind me of that other, older band), but their sense of scope and pompous self-importance is more in line with their British forerunners.  It's a combination that's not entirely unlikeable, and of all their records, OK Computer is probably the most accessible for listeners (excluding, of course, Pablo Honey, which might as well have been a different band).  What you'll be getting if you buy this record is a decidedly alternative, college radio sound.  No power ballads.  Not many catchy hooks.  In other words, not much in the way of radio friendly popular music.  So if that's what you want, do not, by any means, purchase a Radiohead record, ever.  You'll be dissatisfied.    Now, I should apologize at this point for the comparison to Pink Floyd, because the sad fact of the matter is that this group is not as revolutionary or influential as David Gilmour and Roger Waters by a long shot.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you, but this band is not as significant as them at this point in time.  What Radiohead does well is fill the niche that they created for themselves, and really nobody else does it better.  That's good for them, and good for their listeners, and now if everybody could stop arguing about them, it could start being good for the world.    So - OK Computer.  This is their third full-length album and marked their notable departure from the pop music chart scene for the murkier territory of the full-length, sort of kind of concept album area.  What that means for the record is that almost none of these songs are going to be independently catchy or memorable, and that's not why you should buy the record.  This is, indeed, one of its failings, and the first primary reason why I would only give it four stars.  The only song on this album remotely resembling a radio friendly single is Karma Police, and that song is very well done.  A lot of songs on the record are very well done.  Unfortunately, in today's iPod-oriented culture, releasing a record that's basically a forty five minute song is not REALLY what the kids these days are looking for.  I lament and decry that fact, but it is what it is - you have to listen to OK Computer as a whole piece to really enjoy it.  Don't put it on your iPod Shuffle and expect it to do anything other than suck and waste your time.    OK Computer certainly did NOT mark Radiohead's sad departure into self-absorbed pseudo-melancholy (that goes all the way back to their ridiculous whining about their terrible, horrible, profitable fame on My Iron Lung), but it certainly continues it in grand tradition.  There's nothing wrong with being a self-absorbed band.  I mean, come on - Fall Out Boy.  I rest my case.  Even though this is unarguably their best record, and their most accessible, it still sounds very much like it is trying to be what it is.  To quote The Simpsons - \\"The whole thing smacks of effort.\\"  That, for me, is a turn-off.  If it is for you, I'd be careful, but I'd still recommend the album.  The music that's here is just that good.    I have to admit, I was prepared to hate OK Computer.  Any time anything is as over-hyped as this album, it gets my hackles up.  Fortunately, the worst that I can say is that it fails to live up to its own hype, which I doubt it could ever hope to do unless it descended from the heavens on a golden staircase and led us all merrily to The Promised Land.  Since its release, Radiohead may have departed the universe of familiar, entertaining music, but what they have here is a certifiable classic of its time, and something that most music fans owe it to themselves to own.  You won't find radio singles and you won't find catchy, dancy, friendly tunes to listen to while you run your quarter mile around the park, but what you will find is a well-produced, well-executed record.  Honestly, that's all it needs to be to get my recommendation.
B000FGGE5Y|1.0|\\"Ultraviolet\\" is set in some near-future dystopia in which mankind is split between normal humans and \\"hemophages\\" - superhuman but short lived freaks created when an ancient virus was rediscovered and accidentally released.  With vampire-like teeth, HP's are easy to spot, and since they don't wear any gear to protect themselves from a virus they've already got, they're hard to miss even without being the most overstyled characters on screen.  Hunted down by \\"Arch-Minister Daxus\\", the HP's strike back - it's the \\"Blood War\\".  Violet is one of best HP's warriors, capable of mowing down Daxus's troops, breaking into his most secure facilities and possessing the flattest abs on Earth.  Violet has stolen a new weapon capable of exterminating the HP's, but she finds that the weapon is a young boy named Six (Cameron Bright).  It's not clear how he's a danger to the HP's, but the script wisely accepts that ambiguity, and soon everybody wants Six dead.  Obeying a deep maternal instinct, Violet turns against everybody else to protect Six.    THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DECENT MOVIE IF: Reading my own synopsis, it's easy to see how UV could have rocked, which makes it at least as easy to list the sins (multitudinous here) that killed it.  In fact, \\"Ultraviolet\\" wastes little time before proving itself one of the single most preposterous movies ever made, a botch on every level - sci-fi actioner or even cautionary fable.      Wimmer was supposedly deposed by the studio which released a chopped-down version, but what's left in the mix - like an HP - looks too inherently wrong to have been cured by simply extra footage.  The amateurish script kicks off with embarrassingly expository dialog  (\\"As you know our campaign against the hemophages has been highly effective\\") and garish set-design.  It's downhill from there.      UV is supposedly set in the 21st century.  I can accept widely varying visions of how this century will look by the time it's half-over, consistency requires that one society remain within a single vision.  In UV, however, we still have cars, helicopters and firearms even though mankind has created devices that manipulate gravity and otherwise bend relative dimensions in space (Violet can store scads of weaponry in some sort of personal hyperspace - allowing her to single-handedly stage her own rip-off of the famous \\"lobby scene\\" from the first \\"Matrix\\" movie without being weighed down by some big duffle bag or having to wear anything that might obscure her superhuman abs; the humans possess this technology as well, with \\"Six\\" being carried around in an attaché case looking like a slightly outsized Macbook).  Any civilization advanced enough to re-write the laws of gravity and relative dimensions would have gotten past submachine pistols, rotary-wing aircraft or Buicks.  The world of \\"Ultraviolet\\" isn't so much advanced as \\"futuristic\\" - it looks very mod without actually being a plausible vision of an era set beyond our own.  Even the HP's amount to less of a plot element than a plothole.  The HP virus is extremely infectious - a point made well at the beginning of the flick when one of Daxus's men realizes that an unfortunate HP splattered him with its blood.  Unfortunately, this otherwise good scene is almost as fatally infected as the henchman, since it occurs inside the humans' blood bank.  Perhaps the HPs - who broke in without an exit strategy - intended a suicide mission to infect the blood.  The problem is that if the virus is that infectious, HP's wouldn't need to get to the humans' blood supply, they could just infect whole neighborhoods.  Humans wear all sorts of facial covers, but expose skin which proves sufficiently vulnerable to the HP virus.    UV fails as an actioner because it's astoundingly arbitrary.  Daxus's hordes fire hundreds of bullets at Violet without scoring a hit - even when she's directly in their line of fire - while they fall in human waves under Violet's guns.  In a similar scene, Daxus facesoff three armed HPs by himself, and dispatches them with a miracle machine pistol that can fire a fatal shot to each of three men in a single three-short burst, even when they fire first.  (This is most obvious in sword fighting scenes where hordes of enemy swordsmen are clearly swinging AWAY from Violet.)  Because the script can scare up few characters to pit against Violet, it's forced to throw at her large numbers of faceless hordes at her from the beginning.  Costumes aside, all fight scenes pit Violet against large numbers of apparently well trained and armed troops who simply cannot kill her.  In the ultimate of the flick's idiot-scenes, Violet is encircled by hostile rival HPs who are too stylishly duked out to realize that in encircling Violet with their guns drawn, they're targeting each other.  The script offers no explanation for its unbalanced lethality, instead drawing it to our attention when Violet warns Six that their enemies \\"will kill you without even thinking\\".  Putting aside the obvious joke that UV could do with fewer thoughtless killers, despite the firepower expended at that point and the stakes involved, \\"Ultraviolet\\" was surprisingly short on death, as if the film was so eager to kill without a thought that that the script had simply forgotten to kill anybody.  Daxus flops as a villain because he doesn't do much in a flick that defines its heroes and villains more in terms of style than good or evil deeds.  True, the plot has Daxus's ministry paralleling the actions of the WWII genocide, but that happens in the flick's brief expository prolog.  The bulk of the movie only shows the ministry getting its desserts for that prolog, and not doing much to deserve that reception.  In other words, despite his sneers and army of minions (and despite none-too-subtle clues that identify Daxus with the religious-right), Daxus begins the movie as a victim, not the villain.    In short, \\"Ultraviolet\\" is a flick that's horrible and never stops reminding youof that fact.
B000002KLP|5.0|I love Prince. This CD is so tight it will make you loose! I miss the old school Prince.
B000000H3Z|5.0|The unprecedented extremity of 'Reign in Blood' sounded the death knell for 80's thrash, but the pummelling perfection of 'Beneath the Remains' delivered the decisive blow.  Sepultura accidentally broke a few extreme metal boundaries with 'Bestial Devastation', then showed that they could actually play their instruments with the promising yet ultimately transitional 'Schizophrenia'.  Newly signed to Roadrunner and supporting Sodom on their European tour, Sepultura exploded out of Brazil with ruthless intent and showed the rest of the world just how good they were.      On the surface this is a tweak of their previous album, not an overhaul.  Where 'Schizophrenia' was meandering and messy, 'Beneath the Remains' is tight, lean and relentless.  The inexorable, driving thrash rhythms now twisted and turned with merciless precision and purpose.  Igor Cavalera's powerful, dynamic, forceful performance established him as one of the best metal drummers.  Andreas Kisser proves himself as one of the genre's greatest lead guitarists with relatively simple leads that emphasise harmony without resorting to mindless shredding.  The last solo on 'Mass Hypnosis' is the best example; one of the best metal solos ever.    Scott Burns achieves his best production job here.  This band's hunger and forcefulness slices through the murk, but creates an immense, brooding atmosphere of South American darkness in the process.  It fully captures their brutal punk roots that were largely absent from their next album.  Still, it is the songs that make this so essential.  Side A is full of catchy, immediately recognisable 'hits' such as the immense 'Inner Self'.  Side B has a stripped down, sharper thrash attack culminating in the flat-out speed of 'Primitive Future'.  It is brilliant from start to finish.  If Sepultura were to become one of the biggest metal bands in the world, then 'Beneath the Remains' is the reason why.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|I am proud to say I have now read the comic and seen this great movie. Other than taking a little artistic license to make the more relevant to today's audience, the writing and direction stayed true to the comic book as far as I'm concerned. Many reviewers have commented that it is a rip off of 1984, but those people should be blaming Alan Moore for that since he wrote the comic, not the Wachowski brothers. While Mr. Moore may not have been happy with the movie, most artistic people are not happy with other people (with different ideas about what their work means) \\"messing\\" with it. I love the fact that thousands of people can see, read, or hear something and have completely different ideas about what it means. While it has been a couple of years since I read the comic, I thought that the movie illustrated the point of the comic book very well. To me I found the main point to be that people can make a difference if they just stand up. I plan on buying it from Amazon so I can watch it again and again as many times as I want. See This Movie!

B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love Jane Austen movies.  I have most of the good ones.  I like the story, but the video has the subtitle in english, even after I click no subtitle.  Other than that I was very pleased with my purchase.  I received in in no time.  Will purchase other items.
B00003CXDD|5.0|An extremely simple story, nearly a skeleton of a story. A girl is born with a sign on her arm. She has been predicted as the one who will destroy the evil queen of the kingdom. Thus the queen decides to put under surveillance all pregnant women and to check all the babies for the sign. She is not as bad as that after all, and less bad than Herod, though we have here a rewriting of Biblical stories in the feminine mood and gender. But the midwife retrieves the baby and entrusts her to the river. Moses is thus revisited, though in the feminine mood and gender already mentioned. But far from being saved by Pharaoh's daughter she is saved by dwarves. And there the story starts: to escape the queen, then to save the baby from the queen,  trolls and other monsters added into the story for good measure. The best part is that the queen's daughter is going to betray her mother and after all it is the queen's daughter who will recuperate the baby from her direst danger, more or less. The film is charming because of the dwarves. They definitely give some enticing flesh to that skeleton of a story and they help dangerous situations become nearly harmless, at least agreeably pleasant.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B000Q7ZNEK|5.0|Over a decade since its release, it's surprising to hear how fresh Depeche Mode's \\"Ultra\\" remains after all these years.  Equally surprising is how the record even saw the light of day.  Following 1993's \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion,\\" singer Dave Gahan sold his soul to the devil and drugs, and Alan Wilder thew his hands in the air and quit the group.  Those two blows would have killed a lesser band, but DM held strong and released \\"Ultra.\\"  Produced by Tim Simeon of Bomb the Bass, the singles \\"Barell of a Gun,\\" \\"It's No Good,\\" and \\"Home\\" still hold up well, but other glimpses of near brilliance are \\"The Love Thieves\\" and the dark and etheral \\"Sister of Night.\\"  \\"Ultra\\" has been remastered and repackaged with lyrics and photography by Anton Corbijn; we also get a DVD featuring a 45 minute documentary that chronicles the band from 1995-1998, featuring refreshingly candid interviews with the band, Alan Wilder, management and producer Tim Simeon.  The DVD also features the album in 5.1 surround sound as well as b-side tracks and the 1998 single \\"Only When I Lose Myself.\\"  \\"Ultra\\" was released to modest success in 1997, but it's a solid album that warrants a second listen.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Awesome. He just keeps getting better and better. A great road trip CD. Windows down, Bruce singing and playing at the top of his game. Each great song leading to another great song. Leave it in the CD player, keep it spinning. Every word, every note, declarations of truth, melodies full of hope. Absolutely brilliant. Glad I haven't been burdened with a sensitive ear or political ideology that would close me off to this magnificent piece of work. Pure pleasure, pure Magic.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafted one of the best films of 2006 with his Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others). 2006 was one of those years where foreign film held sway over poorer American efforts with both Pan's Labyrinth and this film being released.    The film explores the choices a good man has in a world gone crazy. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler(Ulrich Muhe)is a career Stasi officer who has made it his life goal to serve the GDR. He is a cold often emotionless man who is one of East Germany's best interrogators. His superior Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) charges him with spying on noted Socialist playwrite Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend , Christa (Martina Gedeck). The reason for the spying is ostensibly to find something that can be used by the State to get the writer out of the way so that Culture Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) can get closer to Christa.    The film slowly shows one man's journey from tool of the state to protector of the rights of those oppressed by the system. The viewer watches as the interrogator who has essentially no one in his life opens up when exposed to the world of the writer. This is a world filled with love and music. Things that are missing from his own life. To go on would be to spoil the story but suffice it to say this is a very human story that is told slowly and in layers.    I saw this on the Blu-ray version of the disc and the picture and sound quality were exceptional. The disc features many bonus features. The commentary track by director von Donnersmarck is almost as exceptional as the movie. In it we learn that many of the principal actors were in fact targets of the Stasi. Also featured are an interview with the director, a making of featurette and some deleted scenes,    Do yourself a favor and see one of the best films of the year.
0743298039|5.0|It starts out well. Our heroine, Margaret, is the daughter of a dealer in old and rare books, the kind that can support the family on a handful of special sales per year. She has worked with her quietly doting father from earliest childhood, learning to love both their trade and the many books upon their shelves. Then, on a day like any other, she receives a summons from the most published, and yet personally unknown, author in England. Vida Winters, known for telling a new and different scenario to reporters whenever asked about her past, has decided to finally tell the true story of her life to someone, and she has chosen Margaret.    Leaving the shop, her agoraphobic and distant mother, and her beloved books, Margaret takes with her a ream of paper, twelve shiny red pencils, and the discovered secret that her parents think is safely sealed away in a tin under the bed.     Miss Winters' story, she says, must be told in its proper order, without interruption by questions, with no looking ahead. And she must tell it before the wolf, eating her from the inside, finishes her storytelling forever. Margaret's plan to decline the job suddenly is overwhelmed by the hints of love, loss, tragedy, and deranged secrets.    The daily sessions of story-telling begin with the loss of a mother, the depression of a father, and the rearing of the product of their union. And then the story begins to darken.    Ms. Setterfield creates, with a masterful use of vocabulary and phrasing, a virtual \\"train wreck\\" of events. As the reader watches the engine approach, an inner sense of disaster perceives that the trestle ahead is weak. One by one the cars of the train follow along, swaying and groaning with the stress, starting to tumble into the abyss. Surely the train will stop and the last few cars, at least, will remain in safety. Surely the disaster cannot become worse....    Raised in a house with a reclusive uncle, a housekeeper with dementia, and a taciturn gardener, young Vida suddenly finds herself in charge of the comings and goings of all the residents of the lonely estate, responsible for their needs and for keeping anyone living in the village from intruding on their lair lest they find out their gruesome secrets.    When it seems impossible for any good ending (happy is perhaps too strong a word here), Ms. Setterfield snatches real life away from the horrors of the fire and the insanity, and carefully wraps up all the stories in a satisfactory manner. Whew!    A good, and compelling, read, The Thirteenth Tale will hold your attention and require you to continue to the very end.     Just don't take this book to bed with you.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Denzel Washington is his usual excellent self in this suspenseful movie of whether or not he can change the events of the recent past.  Through super-technological advances, Washington is able to view the recent past to try to determine who was responsible for blowing up a ferry.      While viewing the past, Washington begins to get very interesting in a woman that seems to be connected to the bomber.   As he views her in the past, he realizes that he is able to affect what she is doing so he gets the idea that maybe he can go back to the past and prevent the bombing from happening.    The suspense towards the end of the film is unreal.  A top-notch thriller!
B000UJ48V8|4.0|This is arguably the best film from Kubrick's late period (in which he only completed 3 films in a 24 year time span).  It is a deeply perplexing film, filled with unanswered questions, ambiguities, and the like, but then, it wouldn't be a Kubrick film if it wasn't.  Like many Kubrick films, it grows over time, and you see things you never saw before every time you see it.  Many friends of mine who served in the military have said that the first half of the film is the most accurate portrayal of basic training they've ever seen.  It is 40 minutes of the most intense filmmaking Kubrick has ever done.  It doesn't get old or tired.<br /><br />Many people dislike the 2nd half of the film because that intensity in the first half isn't there.  I have some problems with it, too.  Mainly, there are some awkward dissolves that occur in the beginning of the 2nd half.  I read that Full Metal Jacket was originally supposed to be longer (around 2 1/2 hours), but Kubrick decided against it.  It's rather sloppy filmmaking, and coming from Kubrick, it's especially disappointing, and borderline inexcusable.  However, after a bumpy beginning, the film settles into a groove, and becomes mythic, strange, and surreal, and by the time the final battle is fought, the film has taken on a new life of its own.  Kubrick had said that he wanted to make a film about war itself, not necessarily an anti-war film, or a pro-war film.  Why do we fight wars, knowing how awful they are upon the human pysche?  Yet, we still do them.<br /><br />I like the fact that Kubrick makes no attempt to connect the 2 segments.  It is reminiscent of 2001 and AI, where the acts are not connected in any conventional way.  It leaves the viewer disoriented, but I feel this helps the film immensely.  The film is filled with excellent moments.  The dialogue is superb, filled with memorable lines.  There is some very pointed cynicism during the segment where the soldiers are interviewed by the BBC cameramen.  And the ending is very ironic indeed.  The film leaves more answers than questions, and I like that aspect of it very much.  This is certainly one of the best war films ever made, and one that doesn't cue you how to feel, like some of them do (Platoon, for example).  I never really dug Stone's film; I always preferred Kubrick's film.<br /><br />This review is for the movie itself, not the current edition of the DVD released by Warner Brothers.ronic indeed.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|ALterbridge is clearly a band that has moved on from Scott Stapp and the wake left behind in what was the demise of Creed.

While not overly ground breaking in nature, Alterbridge is just plain HEAVY...and talented. Buy it and crank it today!
B0006A9FKA|2.0|I have to admit I was rather disappointed in this film.  It was occasionally funny, but never rip roaring hilarious like many said it was.  Ironically, Romero's Dawn of the Dead (and Raimi's Evil Dead series) had a lot of dark humour in them already, and they're a lot funnier than Shaun is.  This film tries way too hard to be funny, and you feel like you almost have to laugh.  Sure, there are some chuckles, but the only time I really laughed out loud was when Shaun put on a red bandana, and looked exactly like Christopher Walken from The Deer Hunter.  It had to be intentional.  It was very funny, but the rest of it was sloppy and not the drop dead (excuse the pun) hilarious film that critics and fans made it out to be.
B0007IPBD6|5.0|`Live From the Union Chapel' is a definite must have for any fan of Damien Rice, but even for those new to the brilliance that is this man the album will serve as a great introduction to the hype.  Having personally seen this man live I can honestly say that this album brings back great memories, but it still does no justice to the real thing so I feel that I must state that if ever you have the opportunity to see him live please do take it up for his live show is just outstanding.  This album captures beautifully the serene yet commanding atmosphere that is created at one of Rice's shows.  Taking a few tracks from his debut album `O' and incorporating some rarely heard tracks `Live From the Union Chapel' is an orgasmic companion to Damien's other albums.<br /><br />The album starts with `Delicate' and immediately you realize that this live disc is going to be much superior to the rest.  When attending a Rice concert you'll notice that the audience is filled to the brim with people that respect this man for the artist that he really is and so there is rarely a word spoken while he's performing.  This fact carries well over onto this album.  His words are clear and understandable.  `Delicate' bleeds right into his biggest hit `Blowers Daughter' which is approached delicately and effortlessly.  In fact I'm almost tempted to say that the live version transcends the original recorded version for the emotion and power is so evident in his voice.  `Volcano' is probably his best live performance, on this disc but also when I saw him perform.  He really takes the song to new heights with the musical arrangement.  It's powerful, edgy and raw and I just love it.  Also from `O' we have my personal favorite Rice song ever recorded `Amie'.  The live version on this album is not a brilliant as when I saw him myself.  If fact, I prefer the album version to this, but he still kills it, seriously.<br /><br />Damien's former muse Lisa Hannigan (I say former since she no longer sings with him but has left to pursue a solo career) has her moments to shine on songs like the beautifully restrained `Then Go'.  Her voice is haunting and soothing and perfectly compliments the guitar work.  She also dominates on `Be My Husband' where the tribalesque drum beats lend her a backbeat to bare her soul, and that she does.  `Baby Sister' is one of the best tracks here, from the powerful lyrics and the somber, calming musical arrangement complete with some beautiful cello work.  I'm dying for Damien to release a studio recording of this track, it's that orgasmic.  The ending with the vocal interchange between Rice and Hannigan is so haunting, so masterful.<br /><br />The album closes with Lisa Hannigan blowing us away on `Silent Night' which is a hidden track on `O'.  It's a beautiful way to end the album regardless of your religious background.  It's just a beautifully sung song that perfectly embellishes Hannigan's talent.  If you've discovered the brilliance that is Damien Rice then this is an album you need to pick up for it stands apart from his previous work, and if you have yet to embrace Rice for all that he is then this album will most likely do the trick.as left to pursue a solo career) has her moments to shine on songs like the beautifully restrained `Then Go'.

B000VKW7AK|5.0|disc 1>  It's got everything I love....\\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\"  is Awesome!  \\"Holy Wars...The Punishment Due\\" demo is a nice new twist in lyrics.  \\"Anarchy/Problems\\" session take is nice addition   disc 2>  More of my favorites on one disc.... I had most of these songs on my own greatest compilations minus \\"Strange Ways\\" this song is new to me but awesome Kiss cover! The live tracks are well recorded. \\"Killing Road\\" owns! I'm glad they included this underated gem from my favorite album.  disc 3>  first off, the \\"Duke Nukem Theme\\" is different than what I heard on the score to soundtrack...The good news is THIS version included is undoubtedly better. My only complaint with this disc is I like the original \\"Almost Honest\\" better than the remixed and I wish they had remixed \\"One thing\\" to have more bass instead of tweets.  They could of included \\"The Doctors is Calling\\" or \\"Wanderlust\\" to have rounded out Risk tracks -also The original untouched version of \\"Moto-psycho\\" would of been nice with the ending of the song that interludes into \\"Coming Home.\\" disc three is my least favorite of the compilation  disc 4>  \\"It's Electic\\" is unsuspected great live track -all these songs live sound simply amazing ! Dave's voice on \\"Devil's Island\\" was in tiptop shape even with some ever so slight feedback here and there throughout some songs - wondering why these were never released sooner ??? Intro is funny yet remarkably possible....  DVD> Fantastic show with \\"Countdown\\" lineup! again wondering why it was never released sooner -ANSWER: Better late than never!     I give Warchest an EZ 5 stars just because there are few bands that can muster gas up this kind of solid work! It has most all my unreleased favorites, even a few surprises, and the most amazing 'unheard of' live performances - however I'm puzzled as to why there was no \\"Crown of Worms\\" or \\"99 Ways to Die\\" ???    p.s. the packaging and insert book are very kewl and complete in \\"case\\" you were wondering.
B000HEWEE4|2.0|A few years back a little film called `Frequency' was released.  That said film has pretty much the same synopsis or idea behind it as `The Lake House' with one major difference; `Frequency' actually takes the time to explain what is going on.  I waited the entire length of the movie for some kind of explanation, some kind of reason for the `strange' occurrences but they gave me nothing.  That's not to say that deep down `The Lake House' isn't a sweet little film, for it does have its moments but in the end it's nothing spectacular and definitely not the brilliant film some would have you think it is.  The one thing that this movie does have going for it is its two main stars.  I'm not a fan of Keanu in the least, I feel he's wooden and stiff and uninteresting as an actor, but here he comes alive when paired with Bullock, who just dominates this film.  It's as if Sandra brings out the actor in Reeves.<br /><br />The film follows Kate Forster; former tenant to a beautiful lake house, as she starts to correspond with its next tenant only to find out that it's not the `next' tenant she's writing to.  Kate leaves a note in the mail box as she leaves welcoming the next tenant to their new home and asking that her mail be forwarded to her new address if it happens to show up.  Alex Wyler is the man who receives the letter, but he's living two years in the past.  The two of them start writing to one another and eventually fall in love and want to meet but of course there have to be some obstacles to overcome first.<br /><br />I have a couple petty issues with this film aside from my big complaint about the lack of explaining the goings on.  I enjoyed the chemistry between both Sandra and Keanu but the writer of the script seemed to forget that they are writing letters, not talking on the telephone, and so I couldn't help but become irritated with the conversations they had with one another which, according to the plot, could have only happened if they were standing in front of the mailbox writing short sentences one at a time.  I know it's petty but it was just annoying to me.  The outcome is very predictable as well.  I knew the minute Kate was stood up at the restaurant what was going on (or what happened) but I guess that is petty as well since most movies nowadays are pretty predictable.  I felt that a lot of the dialog was cheesy to the point of cringing, but I get the feeling that's what they were going for, at least I hope it was intentional since it would be pretty sad if the writers actually thought it was good.<br /><br />Surprisingly, like I mentioned, Keanu Reeves is far from bad here.  He actually was enjoyable to watch.  Sandra Bullock is almost always a doll to me and so I really enjoyed her performance, although it was far from a favorite of mine.  Christopher Plummer is good as Alex's domineering father but the very talented Shohreh Aghdashloo is all but wasted here as Kate's fellow doctor Anna.  Other supporting players like Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Willeke van Ammelrooy and Dylan Walsh (Sandra is making her way through the `Nip/Tuck' men huh) are decent but not outstanding given their little screen time.<br /><br />In the end I don't know if I can really recommend `The Lake House' with a straight face.  It's not that I feel it was a horrible film; it just wasn't that great of a film either.  The script was interesting but leaves the audience hanging at the end, waiting for that climactic explanation that just never comes.  If you're a fan of Bullock's or (god forbid) a fan of Reeves then by all means see this movie, but if your looking for a really good movie then there are plenty of better choices ahead of you.ox writing short sentences one at a time.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm a Beatles fan, big time, but \\"Love\\" left me strangely deflated.  I think it was unsettling for me to have the different songs blended and \\"transitioned\\" regardless of chronology in time.  For a longtime fan who can remember the tracks in order on the original albums, \\"Love\\" left me feeling out of sync.  To really appreciate the Beatles evolution, I think you need to listen to their music as it progressed through time.  But for what \\"Love\\" is, music for a live show, I do think it is worth a listen.
B000UR366S|5.0|I find this new work of Joni's emotionally stunning, Both in its jazz infused music and its lyrics. Some of the reviewers don't like what they see as a \\"preachy\\" take on the condition of our culture and our planet. But she is speaking the truth. Her tone is weary but underneath there is hope as expressed in \\"If.\\"<br /><br />For me this work has a definite Buddhist flavor. The ability to see reality, accept it, but continue to work to correct the ills that can be corrected comes across strongly. I am glad she has returned with an offering that encourages us to soften our hearts and show compassion both for ourselves and for our planet Earth. Thank you Joni!
B000A158TC|4.0|Ghost in the Shell has always been one of my favorite animated movies, and since I just got a new PSP 2000 (PSP Lite) recently, I figured this would be a good choice for my 1st UMD.<br />I have to say that I'm very satisfied with it. Sure, there are no special features and no option to switch the audio track to the original Japanese language, but it's a great movie either way and a nice addition to anyone's UMD library.<br />The aspect ratio of this UMD appears to be 16:9 widescreen, but it's hard to tell since the PSP's display is widescreen itself... Although I have heard other people saying that their version is letterboxed or full frame.<br /><br />Overall: This is a great movie to own on UMD. It may not contain any special features or the original Japanese audio track, but UMDs are mostly meant for viewing on the go.<br />If you're looking for a good addition to your collection of movies on the PSP, you can't go wrong with the UMD of this classic anime!<br />If the lack of special features and original audio track are a big deal to you or you just want to watch Ghost in the Shell, buy it on DVD instead...
B000005S37|3.0|There are several reasons why Lou Reed earned the epithet \\"The Godfather of Punk.\\" There's his work with the Velvet Underground, especially the insanely acerbic White Light/White Heat. There's the subject matter of his songs...scoring dope, S&M, heroin, hedonism, amphetamines. There's his appetite for intoxicants which could rival Hunter S. Thompson's. However, \\"releasing\\" this album into RCA's loving hands has to be at or near the top of the list. This is the rock and roll equivalent of Marcel Duchamp putting a urinal in a museum and calling it art.<br /><br />Yes, Lou did use MMM to get out of his contract with his record company. And yes, there are those who can stretch their definition of art enough to encompass this sonic experiment. Ambient music has its fans, to be sure. But the real point of MMM is that Reed proved himself willing to do _anything_, even risking career suicide by releasing it. I admire Lou Reed to no end. However, when it comes to Metal Machine Music, I've never owned a copy, even though I'm glad it exists.
0525950079|5.0|The Pillars of the Earth has been one of my all-time favorite books, and so I was a little skeptical about how good its sequel could be. My concern was totally unnecessary. World Without End, which takes place in the same town of Kingsbridge almost 200 years later and has the cathedral as its backdrop, is an excellent book and I expect that in time it will also be considered to be a masterpiece. Not having read The Pillars of the Earth will not deter you in any way from enjoying World Without End, as other than the common thread mentioned above, it reads like a stand-alone. Follett packs it all in this 1,024 page book -- love, greed, pride, ambition and revenge. Do yourself a favor and be one of the first on line to get yourself a copy of this very entertaining and memorable book. But be aware that your enjoyment won't come cheap -- the retail price of World Without End is $35. I think you'll find, however, that it is worth every penny.
B000RP4LEO|4.0|The glamorous, magnetic Helene Grimaud has established herself, for better or worse, as the French Martha Argerich -- her style is punchy, dynamic, and strong-willed. For me, those qualities are what I dislike about Argerich herself, so Grimaud doesn't convince me. She needs to have more of Argerich's positive qualities -- insight, spontaneous inspiration, and an ability to communicate on the emotional level. This new Emperor from Grimaud feels cold to me; rather than marveling at the pianist's prodigious fingerwork, my nerves were frayed. Of course, other listeners will come away dazzled and impressed.<br /><br />Vladimir Jurowski's conducting takes its lead from Grimaud's impetuosity; he dashes through the score without regard for its deeper meaning. There's a tradition behind this style, going back to Toscanini, Szell, and Erich Kleiber. Many critics and listeners gravitate toward such energy and propulsion. But isn't there more to Beethoven than superficial flash?  The great Emperor done by Rudolf Serkin and Leonard Bernstein (Sony) manages to be even a bit faster than this new version but speaks with much greater eloquence. Ms. Grimaud's banging in the slow movement, for example, belittles Beethoven's lyrical blend of introspection and loftiness. The finale displays her ability to control fistfuls of notes, but why does she need to be so brittle and clattery?<br /><br />The 38 min. concerto is rather stingily filled out by a single sonata, Op. 101, which takes just over 20 min.  There's no doubt that Grimaud is dedicated to Beethoven, and left on her own she thrusts ahead with the same style as in the concerto, renouncing insight in a rather hurried, extroverted reading. Like Pollini, she brings pianism to the surface, showing us how effortlessly her fingers can control the music, but I kept waiting for any phrase or stretch of melody that actually touched me.  Pollini goes far beyond technique, and over time Grimaud may want to look under the surface -- for the time being, however, this is \\"look at me\\" pianism all the way.<br /><br />In the current dumbing down of classical music, one can anticipate this flashy CD becoming a bestseller. So be it.however, this is \\"look at me\\" pianism all the way.    In the current dumbing down of classical music, one can anticipate this flashy CD becoming a bestseller. So be it.
0525950079|5.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett, and admire that he moves in a seemingly effortless manner between genres.  However, his best work is found in the \\"great historical novel\\", and he has delivered handsomely with this latest effort.<br /><br />This is being touted as a sequel to \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" which is true enough, but it is also a little misleading, as it is set 200 years after the tales told in that magnificent novel, and as such can definitely be read as a stand alone novel.  Having said that though, if you haven't read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" - do - it is magnificent!<br /><br />Knowledge of this wonderful earlier work will be helpful, as there is reference to characters from that time and being familiar with their adventures certainly gives you some insight into what is happening at the time, but if you are new to Follett's work, please don't let this put you off.  He mentions enough of the earlier characters (without being boring to those readers who know the book SO well)for any new reader to have an idea of what has happened before.<br /><br />The tale seems simple enough - 4 very different young people witness a fight in the forrest which leads to death and the hiding of a great secret, and this reverberates through their lives for years to come.  What is not simple enough is the detail that goes in to these character's lives - they are all wonderful in their own different ways, and we can all feel that we can see the world they live in, taste their food, smell the odours of their environment and rejoice and mourn as they do.<br /><br />Follett is also the master of understanding how humans think; how they plot and scheme, and how the whims of fate can change a life that seems completely planned and organised.  And all of this in a magnificent medieval setting with court intrigue, pious devotion, illness and the whims of nature!  What more could you want?<br /><br />If you like a good hefty historical novel with a great plot, detailed environment and well drawn and very engaging characters, you will NOT be disappointed.  It is wonderful and I recommend it highly.s, you will NOT be disappointed.  It is wonderful and I recommend it highly.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Having just watched the episode taking in the Pacific from Pearl Harbor, taking in the US surrender at Bataan and the Guadalcanal, knowing there is much more to come in the Pacific, I wonder what certain commentators on Amazon are talking about.    This series dates from the 70s, and the faults of it are there to see: not least the secrecy of the Cold War still in place even after thirty years, from the British certainly and more obviously from the Soviet Union, but perhaps from the US too. Perhaps it is indeed light on the Pacific, but as the US talking heads said themselves on the episode I have just watched, they were putting 90% of their forces into Europe at the time. Also, it is 70s television , and can be so dependent on the visual footage available at the time. as this whole business of accessing footage from other nations was in its infancy.     However these are way surpassed by its pluses, not least its ambition :  TV companies of the USA or anyone else have not produced its own series, if only to rebut the perceived faults of World At War. More importantly World At War includes testimony from politicians, diplomats and soldiers from all sides still alive at the time. And the series starts not with the British, but with the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane : from a British point of view this is a firm dismissal of our own narrow view of \\"we won the war\\".    In Britain we look forward to the screening of the Ken Burns series on the WWII but already the reports are that it is exclusively about the experience of the United States and the other combatants are nowhere. Perhaps this might appease some of those complaining on this forum, but to me this would be much more of a distortion than anything in World At War. At least World at War attempted to cover the war from the perspectives of all sides, not just the fighting Allies and Axis powers but those nations involved or even overrun: the French, the Chinese, the Dutch, the Poles, even the Finns, whose war is forgotten now.    I wish each nation had its own attempt at The World At War but I know of none. In the 30 years since you might have hoped that one would appear, not least from the United States, but it has not happened. I fear now that as the old soldiers are gradually fading away then the the opportunity has gone forever. Meanwhile, in my view, for all its faults, World At War is the best we all have.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|Of all the early Megadeth records this has got the be the most underrated one! It really looks like people give this album a bad rep because of the cover for \\"Anarchy in the UK\\" - I admit it wasn't all that great, but that one song doesn't kill the whole CD! The entire CD as a whole is just as good as every pre-1990s Megadeth album - solid thrash metal! \\"So Far...\\" is heavy, technical and at times jazzy believe it or not, but this is also an album containing some very heavy Megadeth tracks like \\"Set The World Afire\\" and \\"502\\" - classics! This reissue also boosts up the guitar tone to a better quality than the original just like the entire Megadeth remasters series - but your Megadeth Collection isn't complete without this one!
6302477751|5.0|Set in contemporary suburbia, young Victor Frankenstein happily plays with his aptly named bull terrier \\"Sparky\\", when the tragic happens... the spunky pooch is hit and killed by a car. Crushed, Victor struggles to acclimate to life without him, when he receives the bright Promethian idea to re-animate Sparky after watching the science teacher demonstrate electrical muscle spasms with an \\"ex-frog\\".<br /><br />He rushes home to bring his beloved canine partner back to life. Under the suspicious gaze of a neighbor, he gathers the necessary equipment from the garage, and sneaks out to the pet cemetery to disinterr the pup, anxiously awaiting the next storm to arrive, which is fortunately within a couple night's time.<br /><br />Predictably, after studying through several books on the subject, he actually manages to revivify Sparky, who now resembles a patchwork puppy, bolts, scars, and all. Joyful to be reunited with eachother, all seems well until Sparky decides to run amok through the neighborhood, although most of the panic is due to the hysterical nature of a neighbor lady and a whining little girl.<br /><br />When his parents realize that Sparky is actually alive again, they accept his return from the grave, welcoming him back to the family. Eventually, in a classic Hammer scene relative to the tale, the dog retreats to a windmill followed by Victor and the Frankensteins, where it is set ablaze by the frightened mob. Sparky 'justifies' himself by saving the boy, but is consumed in the inferno. Realizing that he saved the boy, everyone now seeks to resurrect Sparky again, via the combined electricity from all their automobiles with battery cables. And thus, little Victor is again reunited with his beloved friend, with a possible 'bride' to boot.<br /><br />Frankenweenie is a delightful little tale about a boy and his dog which would be appreciated by Infernal Progeny and Tim Burton fantoms alike, with that pleasantly oddball twist on a classic.<br />_________<br /><br />* This film, along with 'Vincent', is provided as a bonus feature on the Special Edition Nightmare Before Xmas DVD.provided as a bonus feature on the Special Edition Nightmare Before Xmas DVD.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a great series, fresh, innovative and funny. I wish the DVD set had more shows. One criticism of the disc set is the last two DVD's could have been combined into a single - small complaint - hardly worth mentioning.
B0000041XX|5.0|I haven't watched the dvd yet, but I'm so grateful to have it. There was a problem when I first ordered it and I received the cd. I sent an email and the problem was corrected and I received the dvd in no time. It's suvice like this that makes me feel good about your company, and causes me to keep making purchases.

B00006ADD5|3.0|Re: the budget Columbia Tri-Star DVD.  I have always loved this movie, but be warned, this single DVD version is NOT the director's cut. It is the restored 1988 version, and very beautiful, but it does not have the wonderful (additional) aerial shots and other scenes included in the longer version. Instead we get over 10 minutes of completely blank screen while the musical overtures play (apparently something director David Lean originally wanted). I would rather have had the director's cut. There is no \\"bonus\\" material at all in this version. Use the menu to skip the overtures - unless you need to fix a snack or use the loo.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|very nice film score, really compatible with the theme of the film, a real upsetting work.
B000UK73QO|5.0|The book provides clear information about how and why spiritual and religious teachings may prove less than satisfying even though the path to fullfilment is there. Tolle's depiction of the ego and how it participates in the dysfunction of our personal lives and the world is a \\"wake-up\\" call. Simple, easy to understand ways of becoming more conscious worked the first time I tried them. Simply reading this book,[[ASIN:B000UK73QO A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose]] is transformational.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|It's not often the case these days that a band can consistently put out albums that bring more depth and maturity to their work. All too often, bands recycle old ideas, or worse, try to match themselves with whatever  the public trends (or better still - the big marketing machines) are in to. Not at all true with DKM, thank God!  Although this album is a bit edgier in many respects than Warrior's Code, it maintains an overall tenor that makes the group hard to classify. Are they Punk? Irish? Rock? Heavy Metal? Perhaps one of the joys of this band is that they refuse to be put in a box for easy marketing. And, therefore - in my humble opinion - retain an appeal that strikes the fancy of many types of audiences. Their live shows are a great example of this broad spectrum of appeal. All of which makes landing at # 20 on the Billboard Top 200 list that much more remarkable. Let's hope they can continue to retain their originality with each new recording.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh really outdid himself on this record. I literally listen to Awake everyday. I loved all the collaborations he did. My favorite song definately is February Song. He brings us even 'closer' to himself on this record.
B000TGQDZQ|3.0|I agree with Steele.  The music is immaculate, and Simone just keeps getting better, but the growls simply RUIN this album. I loved Consign to Oblivion, but this one turned me off right from the second track.<br /><br />It is simply too formulaic, and even worse, totally derivative of so many other bands in this genre.  Having just returned from ProgPower in Atlanta this past weekend, I have certainly had enough growling and maniacal double bass drum pounding to last until next year.<br /><br />Mark Jansen, the leader of Epica, is the brother of Floor Jansen of After Forever, as well as one of the former leaders of that band.  Epica could go its own way and become a unique entity, but instead, he feels compelled to take them in the direction of follower, instead of leader in its own right.<br /><br />What a huge waste of talent
0618871713|5.0|I read through Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic by Alison Bechdel in one sitting, steamrolling through it like it was my job.     This book is categorized as a graphic novel, and I see it completely that way. It's very wordy, and Bechdel's style is spare, though there are thoughtful details that stick out: wrinkles on her parents' faces; exact passages from books and plays; the awnings of her childhood home. She kept a journal when young, and this book seems almost more like a review of that journal, fleshing the words out with remembered images and feelings.     Her use of text as an image is interesting, and though it's a true reflection of her past, I felt it a little overused. Her journal entries, illustrated, are an example, her childish scrawls being overcome by OCD symbols and slashes being important but not so much so that every little bit had to be illustrated. Her father and she had their best correspondences through letters, and she illustrates both his profuse knowledge about the books she was reading and also some of his old love letters to her mother when he was in the army. So much illutrated text--I tended to simply skim over them and not read their handwritten messages.    I liked the photographs that she drew in, however. The style of drawing changes in these photographs, looking more realistic, as if trying to say something about the difference between truth and illusion when these pictures were taken, and are interestingly juxtaposed with her comical hand holding them.     All right, enough essay-writing. I thought that the characterizations of her mother and father were brilliant, though at the expense of the rest of her family and ultimately of the author/narrator herself. You get the sense that she's somewhat of an aloof personality, but how much of that carries over after the funeral and into the rest of her life is unknown.    The book is less of a catharsis and more of a realization of how she was a mirror image of her father, a theme that resonates with me quite strongly.     Whether or not you are a comic lover, you can enjoy this novel. There aren't any of those comical tropes of 'bam!' or 'single bound!', or even much digression from standard, square panels, but the subject matter is so compelling that you won't even care. This is not an action or comedy; the nearest comparison that a non-geek might know is Maus by Art Spiegelman, though the subject matter of course is not so apocalyptic.    On the other hand, if you love action-packed stuff, then this might not be for you. Though there are a few pages that would push a movie into R-rated territory, there isn't any violence or much foul language--systemic of a world where Bechdel grew up, not knowing the 'seedy' things that her father did yet knowing that there was some sort of undercurrent.    I gave this book 5 stars, despite my nitpicking, because this is a seriously good piece of work that everyone should read. It's a great way to transition from the written word to the graphic novel, as it doesn't rely too heavily on comic tropes. If you like Maus, you'll love this one.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|Kate Beckinsale is one of the most hypnotic women   I've seen in a long time.   This movie has a very interesting story line with a new twist about   Vampires and Werewolf's  Despite the reviews this is a great movie.
B000J4QWNQ|5.0|This is not an action movie, although there is action. Probably best described as a crime drama - BEAUTIFULLY shot. In my opinion, not liking this film means you probably don't get it or were expecting something else. Michael Manns' signiture is all over this, and his use of the new Viper HD camera is stunning. When i saw this in the theater, it was evident there were M.M. fans there - at the end of the film half the theater stood up and clapped! Check this out in HD if possible! Merry Christmas!
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Having been a dedicated Pearl Jam fan for over 16 years, I bought this album as soon as it was released.  Now I can't seem to stop listening to it.  Among the many great songs on this CD, 'Society' and 'Guaranteed' instantly grabbed me and poured the words straight into my heart.  Eddie's baritone voice is as good as ever and perfect at every step.  This is a softer, more acoustic, more soulfull Vedder than you will usually find with Pearl Jam - and this is warmly welcomed.  Now I just wish this movie was playing within 200 miles of my home.  Until it comes out on DVD, I guess I will just have to close my eyes and listen to the soundtrack.  Thanks, Eddie.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|I know this film is reviled by many but I found it captivating. Having driven across the US many times and having lived in a lot of less than stellar towns, this film struck many notes with me. I know that road and it was the first time I thought anyone captured the intimacy of the experience. I'm not a Vincent Gallo fan and I thought this was his best performance I've seen. Sevigny was a revelation. After the movie ended, I knew why she had done this picture.<br /><br />I nicked the film a star because of the amateurish way Gallo set up the credits. Yes, Vincent, we know you did the whole thing yourself. Tone it down, eh?
B000UNYK76|5.0|Whether you are a Pearl Jam fan or just a fan of good rock music, this is a must-have DVD.  The sound and picture quality are outstanding.  The images of the band are clear, well lit, and in great color.  The DVD has a little 'Rattle and Hum' flavor to it, with live performances on rooftops and the street, as well as intimate portraits of the band members backstage and on their own time.  And most importantly, the band ROCKS with outstanding musicianship and performances throughout.  Thanks, Pearl Jam.
B000002H5I|1.0|Tracy Chapman demonstrates how simple it is to read random selections from a newspaper in a sing-song voice.  I particularly liked how they chose to accompany her with musical instruments in order to suggest melody.  The CD has eleven tracks.  This was done, no doubt, to suggest divisions in what seems to be a 30 minute exercise in how to affect odd inflections of the voice.  Perhaps, in the future, Tracy will treat us to imitations of other musical structures.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Will you all stop trying to draw parallels between \\"Magic\\" and Springsteen's older work?  Isn't the man allowed to create something entirely of this time?  Imagine how bored he must get with everyone begging him to sound like he used to.  How many of YOU sound like you did at 25?  Do you write the same way, talk the same way, even believe all the same things?  Probably not.  So just appreciate this CD for what it is:  A set of thoughts from a man whose rhythm and gait have changed over 30 years--just like yours have.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|A good friend told me this was an essential purchase. The first time I watched it I was doubtful, but it did warrant further viewings. I am so happy I went the extra mile, as I've now watched it at least once a day since then.<br />I love films that make you think and this fit the bill perfectly. A very, very worthwhile addition to any DVD collection. Buy it. Buy it right now.
B000002J1U|5.0|I use to love this music as a teenager, now my son has taken over the passion.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|James Blunt amazed me with his solo debut Back to Bedlam a few years ago. After seeing him in concert and hearing material that would be on his follow-up cd, I anticipated the release of Lost Souls avidly. And I'm glad to report that the cd does not disappoint.    All The Lost Souls offers some more of the singer's melodic balads. Blunt's voice, although not typical, is soft to the ear and great for the heart. His songs are lyrical, dramatic and packed with genuine emotions. These songs about lost loves, heartaches and the pains of being in love can relate to each and every one of us.    My favourite song on the cd is also the shortest. I Really Want You is a great love song about the fears for falling in love with someone for the first time. Annie and I Can't Hear The Music are also very touching songs that I can listen to time and time again wtihout getting sick of them. Finally I'll Take Everything and Shine On are, simply put, just beautiful.    Yes, it's true that I'd like to see Blunt expand his horizon and do something a bit different (which he does to some level with I Really Want You). But when you have a cd full of brilliant song, when you have a cd where you can enjoy every single song, when you have a cd that you can listen to for hours, then you just have to count your lucky stars and feel grateful.
B000FQJAIW|1.0|I bought this DVD because I wanted the 1977 film. However, I didn't check the back cover details properly (ie. 4:3 letterbox, yuck!). Fortunately, I read the Amazon site before removing the shrink-wrap. Thank you to all the reviewers who have warned about this DVD. I then marched back to the shop with my unopened DVD and got my money back. Thanks again to you all.    I will not put up with non-anamorphic DVD's in this day and age. Nor will I put up with a greedy old fart called Lucas who fiddles with film history. It reminds me of when Spielberg stuffed around with E.T. in 2002. The CGI effects he introduced then were dreadful and made E.T. look comical.    I am willing to bet that Star Wars (original version) will eventually be re-released correctly either in time for christmas 2007 or when the HD-DVD or Blue Ray format is settled.     Thanks again to all you reviewers. You all deserve five stars, while this product only gets one star. The best part is, Lucas didn't get my money in the end!!!
0618680004|5.0|I've read a few books of this ilk ([[ASIN:0446579807 God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything]], [[ASIN:0307265773 Letter to a Christian Nation]], [[ASIN:0393327655 The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason]], [[ASIN:1400030846 The Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11 (Vintage)]]) and if you have time to read just one of them, make it The God Delusion. It covers more arguments for the existence and non-existence of God than I've seen in a range of philosophy books on theism over the years. And his sense of humor makes it a pleasure to read.    Then read the other books! The Looming Tower documents much that you will not have been aware of.

B00014TJ6Q|5.0|This album finally became available in CD format 25 years after its initial release.  It is a great album, containing some memorable songs.  I really enjoy \\"Love Comes to Everyone\\" and \\"Blow Away,\\" (the latter of which was supposedly inspired by Harrison doing simple house chores), among others.  George Harrison was a most gifted song writer as well as singer, and this album speaks to his talents.  It is tragic that he did not live to see this album re-released.
