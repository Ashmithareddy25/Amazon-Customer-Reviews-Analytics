B0071XO8RA|5.0|5 stars. Excellent book. I don't normally read sci go but this captured my attention from beginning to end. I would recommend this book to all readers.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I can hardly wait for the next book when you read this book you can turn the pages fast enough
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is very short but a lot of fun. Tricky puzzles that take a little thinking to solve. Loved it.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love angry Birds it is one of my favorite games. It is great fun to play! My grandson and I both like it very much
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game all around! One of the best games I have played in a very long time. The graphics are phenomenal.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|Thought this would be a fun game, don't know yet if I like it or not. Will keep trying. So So!
B004GYY714|5.0|I recently added tunein radio to my kindle fire apps and love it. I can take it outside and play any songs I want while doing yardwork and makes the time go by so much faster.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is ok, would like to see some other ways to play the game. I could just get a deck of cards and do the same thing
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I loved this movie on so so many levels. The characters; everyone knows, lives, or relates to a character in this movie. It is the view inside the head of, for some people, themselves. The obsessive need to have something tangible and real to hold on to, or the absolute loss of control when there is nothing there to keep you anchored. It is all here: life in its messy, beautiful, crazy, insane, loving self. Finding the true meaning in what emotions are supposed to look and feel like, to allow oneself to feel them, process, and see them for what they are, not what you misunderstand them to be. It was a lovely movie, heart wrenching and soul fulfilling at the same time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy facebook, it is fun to keep up with all the friends and family. I like to play some games also on it
B00CW665VI|5.0|it's funny, written just like how I imagine guys actually think and speak! I have a lot of male friends n a lot of what drew says is stuff they would totally say. it's really a pretty perfect book :) definitely worth reading-definitely exceeded my expectations!
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|This is such a good movie. Tarantino really outdid himself on this one! If you are a gore enthusiast, I highly recommend this movie!
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|This is the best game ever I love this game. I recommend that you should definitely play this game. Although it is addicting it is the best game ever I love this game.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|Just as good as the first one. They are a must see! Grab up Kill Bill 1 and 2 and have a movie night!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|The story is full of surprises and twists, and beauty, I've read all of the authors works so far. Can't wait to read her work again.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Not quite as bad as the Twilight series, but not much better.  It's 3 books of whiny teenage narrative of wahhhhh &#34;I don't want to do it&#34; &#34;Why me?&#34; &#34;Life's not fair!&#34;  So she's the only person in the districts who can shoot a bow / hunt and that makes her a hero?  Oh, and skip the movies.  It's also almost as painful as the Twilight movies where you wish for your life back.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love the characters in the story. I can really connect to each one. I can stop watching it. Too bad it is no longer on.
B003K16P3M|3.0|Overall this book was entertaining to read. Slow at times but I enjoyed the action sequences and unique plot idea
B009YP9L7U|3.0|**CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />Megan Scott is single and to me seemed lonely. She was in Vegas for her cousin's wedding. While out with her cousin and her bridesmaids Megan sees Connor Reed. Trying to get the other women off her back she ends up hitting on Connor and drinking more than the average person should. She wakes up with a hangover and husband. While Connor thinks their union can be a win/win Megan wants a divorce. He convinces her that they want the same things in life... That is children without the mess of love. So she gives this marriage a trial run. Connor does everything he can to make her fall for him, even though he convinces himself it's so that she will agree to stay married. When she actually does fall for him he pulls away. Until he gets drunk himself and realizes he does love Megan.<br /><br />Megan comes off like a push over and Connor as a person who loves taking what he wants without thinking about others. On some level they are the perfect match. Connor and Megan both run hot and cold throughout the book, but that was expected. It isn't until the end that Megan gets a little bit of a back bone and Connor realizes he can't control everyone and thing.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|Jack Canfield gives you solid concepts and steps to make the changes necessary to achieve success in life. The key concept he discusses is that you are responsible for everything in your life. At first this may seem harsh, but Jack explains that if you believe this wholeheartedly you have the power to change your life and make it however you want.
B009MYARIK|4.0|A laugh out loud book.  Enjoyable and entertaining though not a literary masterpiece (but then I wasn't looking for a masterpiece either).
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I liked the story and I like Jamie Fox. An African slave who can read and write and shoot faster and straighter than any of the &#34;bad&#34; cowpokes he meets is alittle too much for me.
1878424505|5.0|A true insight into the human condition and how to live your life in complete control and peace! Everybody should read, understand and apply these concepts!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm sticking with the free games, there are plenty!  My husband and I sit together and do them and no one can steal the last piece!  Great app!
1401937519|5.0|Rarely does a book have such an impact at the soul level. Anita Moorjani's personal story will take you from earth to heaven and back again. You'll make this journey with her. As she was changed so will you be changed. A book that you'll want to read more than once. Thank you, Anita, for this deeply moving and beautifully written story.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|These games are awesome and addicting.  Not to hard and really fun. I have played 3 of these games already and so far the story lines have been interesting too.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|I think it's incredible, and genius - a logical progression in Daft Punk's journey. But it is different, and it won't be for some people.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|it freezes from time to time, but still a great app. they're constantly updating and making the game more interesting.
B001NB52PS|5.0|You need to own a copy of this album.<br />You probably already know it; this is out there already.<br /><br />If you don't already know it, buy a copy, set aside some time in a quiet place and listen on a great pair of headphones or speakers. Listen with the lights off. Learn it. Make love to it. Read the Wikipedia article about it and learn the context behind it.<br /><br />After you've done that, repeat with &#34;The Unforgettable Fire&#34; and &#34;The Joshua Tree&#34;.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I purchased this cable as a replacement for my Kindle cable.  At first, the cable worked as intended with no problems. However, it's now nearly four months after my purchase and the cable no longer works.  It hasn't been tugged or abused in anyway - it just simply stopped working.  Can't get it to charge my Kindle.  Out of curiosity, I tried it with a different device, and it won't charge that either.  It was five star worthy after first purchase, but it gets one star for lasting only four months.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie and decided to read the book while on vacation and it was one of those books you wish would keep going a little bit longer. The reader is invited to journey back from the depths of mental illness and anguish to find meaning and identity. The lines between normal and abnormal psyche are blurred by varying degrees of superstition, ritual, tradition and family beliefs around luck for the sports team verge on mental illness. The charm of the unlikely heroin an d the love that underpins the motives and the courage to move forward and keep doing so even when the predicted happy ending is replaced by another is fascinating for those of us who've had to look for the silver lining in life. Good read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing! It, in my opinion, is way better than temple run! Fans of temple run will not be able to stop playing this!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Very well written.Love all of Lee Child's books! He is very detailed in his stories. He also keeps you  wondering what is going to happen next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because the horse I have reminds me of the horse I ust  to have to have a horse like that but then they moved it somewhere and I never sew him.But this game is grate. fun game. I akt. like it is a real horse because I always wake up feed him do my corse. then let him play!!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This audio interface is fantastic. It takes a little getting used to, but after an hour you will have it mastered. The sound quality is great! The direct monitoring is a little quiet, but that is no complaint all things considered.<br /><br />All in all, if you need a budget system at home: get this. It is perfect for Mac or Pc.<br /><br />[Update: Oct. 9, 2017: Still going strong! I have personally updated to a different system, but my brother still uses the 2i2, and I used it just the other day! It's a decent box with good audio!]
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Got this so I could play my son's videos on the Kindle Fire during transit. Works perfectly with the codec suggested when you first start it up, great options and easy user interface.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I've enjoyed this game. The mini games are fun, graphics quality is good, and quests are challenging without being frustrating. like many games of this genre, you do eventually reach a point where you can't continue quests without social media websites or real money. the apple mini game also occasionally has a movement glitch.<br /><br />The game also frequently fails to save, leaving you to repeat progress that should have stayed completed when you did it the first time.
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|A taste of real life, beyond any masks. Bukowsky describes reality without any concessions to deceivement which softens our soul.<br />Life goes on, it hurts, but the individual man cannot fight against pain and the final catastrophe. He just fights without an enemy,fighting is just the way you stand upright in the storm of life.
B00APVIDFI|4.0|My wrists are too large for this watch, so I gave it to a buddy of mine.  He really likes it and has worn it since.  It looks sweet!  In a well lit room, it is quite bright.  In a dark room, this thing is BRIGHT!!  Awesome gadget, I gave it 4 stars for the diameter of the band.  I am 6'4 however, so my wrists are quite large.  Well worth the price though.<br /><br />Not waterproof.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I love this game so much. I play it like all the time. It is so much fun to play. I think you will enjoy this game to. So I think you should buy it.
B000B589JI|2.0|Yes, mine too leaks.  Tried all sorts of things to remedy: Teflon tape, extra rubber washer, different rubber washer, sealing edges of washer, and so on.  Spent more time than its worth.  When I first got it, I tipped it on its side when full, 30min later, 1/2 empty.  Idea is cool, but not mastered on an industrial manufacturing level.  Too many of these things leak.  The keychain extras are amazing however!  Shipped fast, way sooner than predicted.<br /><br />For $10.... meh
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is amazing! At first it was a little hard and I had to use the hint guide. But after playing it a couple of times I got the hang of it. Literly, I memorized it. You should totally buy this game, its worth the money.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Love the series. The packaging was easy to open.  The DVD's were in brand new condition. What more can I want... Besides Season 3?
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far so good. have only been playing for 20 minute..good sign that i'm not ready to &quot;uninstall&quot; it yet...better than a lot of similar games. for sure
068981528X|5.0|My son had this when he was little and we had a hog farm.  It was really fun to read to him and he loved it.  I bought it for my grandkids.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is very fun to play and does not require much thought.  I enjoy playing out at night before bed.
0805047905|3.0|I don't personally care for this book as it doesn't really do anything for me.  But I have noticed that the grand babies pick it up often.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was an awesome series, so awesome that I bought the Shift Series even before I was done reading this one.  The other day someone was being snotty, talking about how some science fiction wasn't scientific enough for them. I responded that the science isn't all that interesting if you don't care about the characters in the book you're reading. I did care about the characters in this book. The self-sacrifice, the choices these people made and continually remade, even understanding their selfish ones. It kept me going page after page, and I just burned through this book, only to flip right back to the beginning so I could read it again. Hugh, you say you read all of these reviews, so, &#34;Thanks, Man. This was one heck of an awesome read!&#34;
0399226907|4.0|Bought because I rememberd from my childhood... that's a long time ago.  Bought for my grand kids.  They seem to enjoy the pictures.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game to me resembles the old Diablo games. Good game play. The biggest con is the need to spend real money or take a lot of time to get the better equipment.
B00BR9SP6O|5.0|Excellent read, however I had to brush up on the War of the Roses before starting this facinating part of British History.  Phillipa weaves a spellbinding, fast paced story of love, murder, intrigue.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Like the other Harry Bosch books, this book had several twists and turns. I enjoyed it very much.  Now on to another one
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Brought back great memories from 1988 and a fine live performance from the definitive Iron Maiden line-up.  A little dissapointed with the concert picture quality, it didn't seem much better than the original VHS, but the bonus features make up for it.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Wonderful characters; perfectly cast; precisely drawn story lines. Art direction, costumes, sets, all are remarkably lovely and true to the time.
B005N09L5C|1.0|This movie was not engaging at all.  I read the book a long time ago, and while I'll admit it's a tough movie to bring to the screen, it just didn't work for me.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfers is really cool.  The only concern that I have is that the jumping shoes don't help but otherwise the game is great. You don't have to spend any money and every month you change locations scince it is a world tour. The game also has a bunch of cool prizes and challenges.
B001XUKFAQ|1.0|sucks, and saying that's more time than I care to spend on this after already wasting my time to watch this crap!
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|First off, let me say that this book is extremely well written.<br /><br />Secondly, let me say that this book might have been a tad bit over written.<br /><br />I thought this could have used a bit more editing. There were descriptions and explanations that tended to go on a bit long for my taste. (Though, they were very well written). Cutting some of it may have helped the book not to lag in many parts, which it tended to do at times.<br /><br />Other than that, this was a thrilling and original novel from a first-rate writer. The characters develop well and the romance develops at a believable rate. (i.e. the characters don't meet and immediately fall into love/bed together).<br /><br />Deborah Harkness has blended fantasy, history, and science in a way that I have never come across in any other book, which gives her story a richness that takes it far beyond some run-of-the-mill vampire/witch love story.<br /><br />Diana Bishop is a powerful witch who is only now just discovering the true extent of her powers, thanks to a scientist vampire, Matthew de Clairmont, and a mysterious manuscript that has been lost for over a century. Now she is hunted by vampires and daemons, as well as her own kind, who want her secrets as much as they want the manuscript that only she can touch. An uneasy alliance is formed between witches and vampires, as Diana and her new-found vampire love delve into the mysteries that Diana and the ancient manuscript offer. But what will such a discovery of witches lead to?<br /><br />I haven't read the sequel yet, but I feel like this book was really setting up for most of the action that is to come. That said, Shadow of Night should prove to be an explosive follow-up.<br /><br />I give A Discovery of Witches 4 out of 5 stars.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|An appalling yet captivating and intriguing tale. It is hard to stop reading as you have to find the fates of all the characters.
0307387178|5.0|i bought this book after my friend suggested it. it did not disappoint, the way it is written the words flow off the page and you read the book straight through. i have since given the book to a friend and he loved it as well.
B0070Y60YE|5.0|Keeps time, large numbers, big face, colorful, the hint of red on the hands is perfect and the 10 year battery makes it stand out over all the rest and puts this Timex over the top of Mt. Everest.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|If you have ever played Mario bros you will definitely see a resemblance. But enough differences to really enjoy the game. Fast paced and hard to put down once you pick it up.
B005OYKI1I|2.0|This movie is not 5 stars. The action is not even based on cars except the last scene and even that is more about smashing things than racing. There is more punching and gunfights than driving in this movie.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Well done and well cast. Learning about history...seems accurately portrayed when compared to historical sources . I like it a lot
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was  a very good book. The 2 one in the series and it was catching. It had you there and kept you wanting to know more and what was goiong to heppen. Everyone should read this
B00242KCWS|5.0|Sonic Brew is the debut album by the American Heavy Metal band Black Label Society. Black Label Society eventually evolved into a full-on band, but at this stage they were essentially just the solo project of Zack Wylde, the guitarist made famous by playing in Ozzy Osbourne, and who had released one piano filled solo album and one Southern Rock album with Pride And Glory.<br /><br />The sound of Sonic Brew is a dirty, muddy and doomy mixture of Classic Heavy Metal touches, a sort of Stoner Rock approach, and also occasional hints of Alice In Chains in Zack's vocals. Its all packaged in a theme of Biker culture and alcohol consumption.<br /><br />Where the album really shines, as you may expect, is in the lead guitar department. While not as melodic as Iron Maiden, or as measured and full of feeling as Pink Floyd, the guitar solos are blistering, full of tricks and personality. Zack has a very distinctive style, so much so that you can tell its him right away. If you hear it and dislike it, this may become a problem because this style is not only prevalent on the album, but throughout his entire career. If you like it however, great news! There's loads of it to enjoy.<br /><br />Black Label Society's groovy, heavy, slightly stoner rock sound casts a wide appeal. They would be suitable for fans of Black Sabbath, Pantera, Down and Clutch. If you enjoy the heavier side of Ozzy especially, you may want to check the band out.<br /><br />Sometimes people can get a bit snobby about Zack and the band, leveling `style over substance' or `not heavy enough' at them, but this record is a straight forward, heavy and impressive collection of meaty, substantial songs. So if you heard a few BLS songs and thought they were too commercial, too grungey, too generic, or not raw enough, then Sonic Brew is probably worth trying first, rather than the likes of Mafia or Shot To Hell. This album is one of their heaviest, darkest and least commercial efforts. Its just full of fat dirty riffs, its got big grooves almost all the way through and it picks up some pace every now and again instead of living exclusively in the mid-tempo range. It has some colour and balance, but isn't overly full of ballads or radio songs. This record even still has a faint hint of Southern Rock to it here and there, more so than any of the records which would follow.<br /><br />Highlights include the storming opener `Bored To Tears' as well as `Lowdown' and the ferocious `The Beginning ...At Last.'<br /><br />Overall; if you like Black Label Society anyway or anything else that you've heard Zack appear in, this is a good album to check out. If you want them at their rawest, darkest and heaviest, then look no further.its got big grooves almost all the way through and it picks up some pace every now and again instead of living exclusively in the mid-tempo range.

B001NHNG64|5.0|I really like this story. It was a good pace and I was really ready to find out what Jack was going to get into next.<br />Everyone read on.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|As a long time fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs and especially his Martian series of books beginning with \\"A Princess of Mars\\" I was thrilled to see this movie finally happen, with the special effects technology needed to bring ERB's imagination successfully to the screen.  I think Burroughs would be greatly pleased with this production.  If you love science fiction adventure on a grand scale, you should love this one.  Yes, some film-makers after Burroughs' time \\"copied\\" many of his concepts and stole his thunder, but this is the original story that inspired them all and is well worth seeing on its own merits.  Definitely 5-stars in my book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I could not stop reading it and spent late nights reading.<br />This series should be read by all if not already.<br />Loved the ending as I wanted to.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|In early February, we attended the &#34;live&#34; performance that introduced &#34;Brave&#34; and many of the songs from &#34;All That Echoes&#34;.  It was live in the sense that it was performed live in New York City and broadcast to movie theaters across the country...including one here in Central Florida.  We saw parts of the performance again when shown on PBS.  The performance was very enjoyable...including a question and answer session.  Having the music CD is a great way to remind us of the earlier enjoyment.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before reading the book. THis was good to do as I have a better undertstanding os the characters now and what they have to do and did.<br />A must rerad for all.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Love this knife. Excellent for camping. Very durable. I have made some modifications to the sheath and know the knife is even better.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I completely enjoyed reading this book. I have been realing all of them in a sequence, and to now read this was what I needed. I completely know who Jack is and what make him tick and it was so good to know who he got to the point of where he is now.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love this game. It has great graphics and it's not to hard. I like the mystery party and unlocking New parts to the game and getting the<br />clues for each part of the game. Would definitely recommend!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a very good book to read. After seeeing the movie One Shot I decided to read a bbok and this was a very good choice to start with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I like that you can connect Facebook and find out your friends score so you can try to beat them. Anyone could enjoy this app and I recommend it to everyone!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Battery HD is great. It accurately measures your remaining battery power, and graphs power levels over time, so if u find that you are often loosing power in your Kindle, you can look back an  see when an  what is causing  that battery drain.  I use it often and love it, an  u will too.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|Was a very good movie. The actors they picked were the right ones for the job. Had a very good story line to go alone with the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is greatt you need to have good hand eye coordination i love how it gets faster and harder the longer you play i recomend this game for everyone
B005LAIHCM|5.0|Not what I thought it was about but once the movie started it was a very good show and glad I watched it.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|fabulous and convenient. purchases have been effortlessly placed and watch list kept in tack. I really like this app for kindle fire
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|MOVIE REVIEW: I thought it would be a cheesy movie, but I was surprised as to how good it was! It's got attitude, heart and senseless robot on robot violence! What more could you ask for?<br /><br />BLU RAY REVIEW: Great amount of features, crisp picture, great sound.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I had seen this exact set in Wal-Mart for over $20 yet I was able to get it from Amazon for under $6 delivered.  The extras on here are great.  I bought my copy in time to watch the day before the new film Star Trek Into Darkness opened.  This is a must have for anyone who is building a video collection.
B00AWJYJVA|5.0|In his later novels (since The Secret Pilgrim 1990), le Carre has focused on the themes in which the role of the state is compromised by political deals and commercial self interest. His characters have to deal with moral conflicts which often lead to their own demise as political spin and the Secrets Act combine to silence their capacity to speak.<br /><br />Le Carres characters are artfully sketched using selective observation and effective dialogue. His story lines are truly woven and often unpredictable in their resolution. The psychological portraits are real. I love his prose style.<br /><br />If you seek a novel offering the restrained drama of characters empowering themselves to fight for good in an amoral world, look no further. Le Carre is the master.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|My wife and 20-year-old daughter watched this one together as we had a night in during a bad thunder storm.  This is a creepy film.  Done very well, it had all three of us hoping not to find any old film or pictures in our current house!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great. The best app for Iron Man have ever seen.  It is... well AWESOME.<br />The only thing I will complain about is... well nothing. Again it is AWESOME!
B009JZSFUY|5.0|Great movie nice effects. Great memorable lines. The line must be drawn here. Seven more words 4 more words lol
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I had a tough time slogging through all the medical technical stuff.  Dr Alexanders credentials would have been enough for me.  I appreciated all the effort he made to tell of his experience.  The butterfly thing kind of reminded me of the butterflies in Avatar.
B004XQO90O|5.0|The DVD is great, just as expected.  quality of the item is real good, and the movie is enjoyable, watch over and over.
B0014KFV6I|5.0|I remember hearing this collection of music back in the 70s and thought to myself &#34;30 years from now this will still be just as great!&#34; It still is and the recording is even better. Thanks Carole King and Amazon for making it easy to replace the old LP that I just plain WORE OUT!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I feel left out. I never saw the origonal series as broadcast on TV, I didn't even know it existed until it was too late. I saw this movie at the store when it first came out and thought it looked like an interesting made for TV movie spin off. Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Encapsulated is an amazing deconstruction of the members of the crew of the Firefly class Ship Serenity. Their quirks, their habits and their interactions with one another. You get a sense of who everyone is and where their places are on the ship. This was a great introduction for me, as I would only later discover that there was an entire series before the events of this movie. More to the point, when I watched that show I realized how the single movie paled in comparison to the narrative woven by Joss W. in the Series.<br /><br />I thought the movie would be an exxageration of the show, boy was I wrong. The movie is the show, drawn out and with the bells and whistles of holywood magic, but it is the show and these are the characters. If it had to end, this was a hell of a way to send it off. If you love sci-fi that breaks the mold and shows you a different kind of future that's flush with hints of our past, this is for you. It's got humor, it's got space ships, it's got government conspiracies and it's got cowboys and robbers. In one word, it's the goran.
B00846REIS|5.0|Th relationship between Eva and Gideon is real. There are real problems that I can totally relate to. I completely understand the irrational jealousy that Eva feels at every turn. The sex is HOT and the love these two feel for each other is palpable. It is definitely on my favorites list to be read over and over again!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Where to begin. You will not find a single fault with this series. Not one. The stories are not &#34;been there done that.&#34; They are told with the love of a true creator. They are carefully woven into eachother to form a vibrant future-esque world where a group of odd compatriots work together to survive and stay safe from a malovelent and oppressive government and the assorted thugs of the galaxy.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray does what apparently the network execs never thought to. It presents the series in the correct story sequence. How Odd that Joss W. wanted his audience to understand why Mal and his first mate hold such contempt for the core planets and their government. You find out how the Tam's come to be on Serenity, any why the Companion puts up with her host. Watching it in full in its intended broadcasting order makes me sad for the director having to put up with moronic studio execs who shattered thes steady build in drama and revelation Joss W. had crafted.<br /><br />I was introduced to firefly through the movie Serenity, and I am now even more amazed at how the arc for the story in that movie had its roots in the opening episode of this series. It is obvious the creators loved their world and took time to craft scenery and dialogue to flesh out these characters and make you forget you are watching a show.<br /><br />The menues for these discs are beautiful and easy to navigate. The picture and sound are top teir and the extras are aplenty. This series is selling for much cheaper than it is worth, and you owe it to yourself to buy this if you are a fan of unique sci-fi that is focused more on character development than neat wiz-bang technology.<br /><br />This is solidly re-watchable entertainment that is a steal for the price.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This was just what I was looking for, a tough workout that only takes 20 minutes. I have been doing it for 12 days now and highly recommend it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I picked up this book after watching a segment on OWN with Oprah and Sheryl Sandberg.  Women and Men who have ever struggled with finding their voice and want to lead, this is the book to read!  No matter what the field, or what level you're working from, there are insightful tips on how to step into the leadership role you've always wanted.  There are practical ways to change your thinking and words of encouragement for those pushing to make change not just outside in the workplace but also within.
1439152802|5.0|I felt the need to laud this book as soon as I finished it. I stumbled upon a copy without a dust jacket inside a beach cottage during vacation. I didn't know anything about the plot, but I figured I'd just give it a try. I couldn't put it down after three pages, and I found myself sneaking off to read more every chance I got! I absolutely fell in love with each of the characters, and was in tears at the end. This is a great, well-thought-out and beautifully told story, and Morton wraps everything up so nicely. Definitely on my highest recommendation list.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Not as scary as some of the temple run games but still action packed.  Love all the levels especially Winkie
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I am shocked by their level of greed!  Well actually, I shouldn't be, but on principle, I will NOT be buying any version of this movie from Disney.  I work too hard for the little bit of money I get to spend on movies and by Disney pulling this stunt shows their lack of respect for their buyers. I shudder at the bought of what they have in mind for the Star Wars movies!disney made the push to \\"make it blue\\" and we did.  Now they won't offer ultraviolet copies of their movies, just digital copies. To get an ultraviolet copy you now have to pay an additional price, close to original sale price, just to get a ultraviolet copy.
B009GEAWOU|3.0|Have enjoyed the show since season one, but season 8 is one of the weakest season. I feel like the writers are having trouble rapping up the stories for their characters and are choosing to go the easiest route which is disappointing to me. But the show is still entertaining and has is hilarious moments.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie is an excellent family movie depicting the search for purpose that sometimes is seemingly inherent to the human condition.  Of course, having Santa Clause depicted as a Russian that cusses with Russian composers' names while wielding two swords is great!
B00B6OEDS4|5.0|I hadn't heard of them until my nephew introduced me to their music. I loved their sound.and found it very soothing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Lots of fun...funny upgrades too.  Don't waste coins on dumb stuff until you get all the gadgets and rocket packs.
B00628RVV0|5.0|Although this film has received criticism for its inaccuracies depicting the horrors of Nazi Germany and the Holocaust, its major accomplishment of leading the viewer through a subtle, realistic change in perspective is nothing short of brilliant.  The acting, sets, scenery, script, staging all bring together a feeling of being present to witness the innocence in the midst of sheer evil of war and genocide. I teach this film in my Holocaust unit--it provides an experience for my students that is nearly as close in intensity as I experienced at their age when I walked through Dachau.
B007SSDBBM|5.0|Who says you need on screen sex to make a movie enjoyable?! This love story is wonderfully acted and beautifully scripted. As always, Hugh Jackman is a great hero without having to kill anyone and Meg Ryan represents a lot of what women want to be, eventually being true to her heart even though it makes no sense to do that. We all would make the same choice. Watch it more than once to get all the subtle messages.
0553062182|5.0|This is a good book for understanding your highly sensitive self and to know that its ok to be this way.

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when I picked this book, and I am very glad I did. I learned so much about how and why I do things, without really thinking of it. This book taught me a lot, and now I am more aware of my habits (good and bad) and have a way to fix myself.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|This is a fun show to watch and one that I'm glad to have in my library. Worth the time for a fun watch.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A great introduction into the world of Dr Who for those who haven't encountered this awesome series before. Great costumes, puppets, and effects. And it only gets better. Enjoy!
B00BDRJ3Z2|3.0|I hear a LOT of similarities from the last album though. The term &#34;Buzz Kill&#34; or &#34;Buzz&#34; was used a few times on the last one and several on this one, including the title of one of the songs. He has got to be in his mid to late 30's, but sings as if he was in college.<br />I loved every song on Tailgates & Tan Lines, but none have stuck to my mind on this one. I hope he does better next time.
B005NFVZTM|3.0|There's nothing special here. It's a &#34;reboot&#34; that draws on the failed legacy it inherited. Some fun action sequences that miss the point of the source material. not boring, not so stupid you feel you've wasted your time.
B00BAHKQW4|1.0|Don't buy this game its a crappy labyrinth hard to tell where you are or what your doing and the attack control sucks
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great gradual increase in skill. Fun Game for Fungi. Sound could be addressed. Get rid of music and change soung of car to represent the add ons you bought
B007CF7L9O|5.0|very detailed neat piece life time lasting almost indestructable , would need to be monitored to age appropriate for if you were wacked by this thing it would hurt

Go to Youtube and type &#34;stand by me&#34; this PFC recording has had over 50 million hits-it will come up first- and everyone I have shown it to or told them about it has been wowed.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|There isn't much to say, other than this is one of their best albums to date.  I've had it on repeat for the last several days. Love it!
B007R41E8O|5.0|This is one of the best hidden objects game I've played in a long time. The story is really strange but the mini games and graphics are really good. This is a must for anyone who likes these type of mystery games. Excellent.
B00168ML1G|5.0|This was a great Marvel superhero movie. When I was a kid Iron Man was, to me, not a top notch super hero. Spiderman, Fantasic Four, Superman, Batman, etc were top of the heap. I always considered Iron Man second tier - a little bit like Green Lantern or the Flash.<br /><br />But this movie was great - it condensed 6 or 7 years of the comics into a single movie. That might be a problem long term but sure made for a exciting part 1.<br /><br />The plot was excellent and the CGI was VERY well done. The acting was super as well(especially Downey). My only beef was with Gwyneth Paltrow and that was a very minor one. Picture was top notch, sound was great and directing didn't get in the way of the story. Viewing this on a 50 inch LCD HD TV sure made for a great time. It's one of the movies we're going to show this summer on our outdoor 10 foot screen.<br /><br />This was nearly perfect - even the pacing was great. I would rate this a 9.5++ out of 10 stars
B007G92QGO|5.0|Excellent and original. A slice of real life when it all goes wrong. I can relate to this story. Landay displayed the insights of a prosecutor and that of a father and mother.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is cool and fun to play its just a little bit extreme with the pearls but other than that it's relly fun!
B0045NXMJE|5.0|This is a terrific film about a subject matter that rarely gets covered in narrative film, let alone a comedy/satire. Without spoiling this terrific film, I would recommend that you just watch it and be captivated by the story!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing! I strongly recommend it to everyone of all ages!(: It is entertaining and a fun way to spend time when you have nothing else better to do! Enjoy!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I really like the John Cory character.  Being a retired police officer, I get his humor.  I would have given it 5 stars ( I like DeMille that much) but there were some boring spots to get through.  I thought it was interesting that he brought in the Paul Brenner  character of General's Daughter and Up Country fame.  Once again Kate is his straight man and he and Paul banter some.  Overall another hit.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|People say it is a boring book but it isn't. I can't wait for the sequel! I recommend highly. REACHED here I come.
B0058BI896|5.0|Videos are amazing no pausing freezing or funny business just ordered & watched i bought 5 seasons thus far! I LOVE the big bang
B005FPT51K|3.0|I like the concept of the ibaby. When it works, it's great. The quality is very nice. But it has some wifi connection issues.
B00B5ARKDE|5.0|This movie is a great movie to enjoy with the family. It's not serious at all, it's lovable and fun. Who doesn't enjoy miniature cape crusaders fighting crime.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a lot fun but every once in awhile I have to wait for something that takes like 24 hours to do whatever. but I don't mind.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This movie shows how the marines responds to the threats of the universe before Spartan show up to save the day. It also gives you a glimpse of Cortana's processing her emotions towards Master Chief. Nice movie.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|What seems like a beautiful distraction becomes an obsession. Gorgeous game that can be easy enough for a child,  but challenging enough for an adult.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is very well written, and it maintains the reader always alert of what will be the outcome. I had read the first one of the trilogy and it had happened the same thing.  Other customers should consider it is an adult language and they have to feel comfortable with with this kind of book.  In any case it may help married couples to improve their sex life.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|lot faster than my previous, but just about anything would have been.<br /><br />this is part of my quad yearly computer rebuild and I decided to go for almost top of the line. it is worth it.<br /><br />hopefully it will last at least as long as my athalon X2 has/is lasting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had already read the first two of the Trilogy and they are all very well written by the author.  This kind of adult books are not very common and some people may feel uncomfortable with the language.  But they may help married couples to improve their sex life.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Fast pace, beautiful scenery, well acted, great dialogue!  Totally recommended.  Why does a review require twelve words?  It does not need it!
1439130833|5.0|I read the daily teachings each morning and try to use it throughout the day.  Missing a day doesn't matter, I just pick up where I left off.
B000N0WCLC|5.0|I honestly cannot believe DiCaprio has not received an Oscar yet. Maybe the academy is actually a bunch of manatees in a tank picking colored balls.<br />Whatever the case, this movie is one of the best. The topic is fresh in movie world and the acting is first class. I truly enjoyed the acting, photography and the story, cruel and violent as it is, because it is well put together and it does not shy away from the hard reality.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|can't wait to read the next one.<br /><br />It has a story that keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens
B000NY12LO|5.0|This story captures the readers interest immediately.  It tackles a difficult subject and offers the reader insight into both sides of this painful journey.  It is thought provoking and very well written. Again, she manages to make all her characters believable and sympathetic. I love her style of writing and am on a quest to read all her novels!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome you can play against your friends on facebook<br /> who gets the hieghst scores it is so awesome!!!!!
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|The series was never burned out and the New Star Trek shows no respect for the original fans and even though I like the New Film better than the  last one, it is nothing new or surprising, it was completely predictable rehashing stories from all 5 of the first ten movies.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story line....gave a look into a possible but demented future if we don't make our governments accountable... the end
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed a very realistic description of technological aspect of the story. The author managed to stay realistic and stick to the solid science, without getting too technical or boring. Humour was great, but please be away of all the curse words in the book. In this case I thought they were unavoidable, as they really added an extra personal dimension to the main character's depiction. Entertaining, thrilling and fun! A must read for all future Mars colonists and explorers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like so much and on June I will put a video on YouTube.please watch kadenplaysminecraft.it is going to be a blast!

B008BU75IQ|5.0|just loved this book, but the end leaves readers high and dry and with MANY QUESTIONS, when will we get volume 4 Sir Jeffrey????
B002APU580|5.0|It had the best quality ever I love this movie and the sound was really good too. Just amazing everything.
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Darius has another great mix on this CD. He has a great future ahead in country music and has the voice and song writing ability to back it up. Great job Darius keep up the great work!
B00C10N3EW|5.0|Once again, Joe has taken his music to another enigmatic level. The acoustic sound is stirring and, yet, calming. The blend of instruments is a pleasant integration of classical, bluegrass/country, and various other influences (Irish, Old European, African, etc.). Joe's technique is absolutely unbelievable. How can anyone pick strings that quickly and accurately??? I am a strong Clapton fan and this CD reminds me of a contemporary &#34;Unplugged.&#34; Listen to the samples and you will buy the CD. Buy it and you will love it!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|A classic movie that I have always loved this was not a bad remake. I don't think it is nearly as good as the lord of the ring series so far and get the feeling it was produced more for money than quality as I don't see how they can turn this into a six hour movie but time will tell. Overall a good movie but a let down when compared to the Lord of the Rings series.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Read this book.  It says so much about the creative process in so few words.  But, those words encompass the essential concepts and necessities of creativity without the stifling mythology and misconceptions we've heard so often.  It's clever.  It's true.  It's fun.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|This is just a funny movie that is fun to watch...has become one of my favorites of recent times. The best way I could almost explain it is like an awesome B rate move that they did not skimp money on.Well worth the time to watch and I'm sure you will enjoy it when you do.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|The first CD was great and I pre-ordered this when there was only one song that I knew. I love the whole CD. Thanks.
0345529057|5.0|Wife really likes these books , gives her a better understanding of the HBO series Game of Thrones. Books arrived in record time and were packaged nicely.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Raiders of the Lost Ark 4.5/5<br /><br />I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and the big screen (in old 35mm prints and in IMAX). Each time they have been sold-out. I can't think of many films that still sell-out 30 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.<br /><br />The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the clich&eacute; and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck, or the sword/gun fight.<br /><br />I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well...no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey, and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.<br /><br />The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.<br /><br />The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of today's movies.<br /><br />You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars!<br /><br />I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fifth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to after the travesty of KOTCS. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show, which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).<br /><br />I am giving Raiders 4.5/6 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 5/5 movie) as I often prefer darker and/or critically undermined sequels. Even 32 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 32 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.<br /><br />Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 5/5<br /><br />Set before the events of 'Raiders', Dr. Jones is in Shanghai doing business with Chinese crime boss Lau Che. Losing the upper hand in a night club he barely escapes with his life (and baggage in the form of Willie Scott and sidekick kid Short Round) to the airport. But little does he know the plane he gets on is owned by Lau Che and the pilots sneak out in mid-air while they are sleeping.<br /><br />After jumping to safety in an inflatable dinghy Indy, Willie, and Short Round drift by an Indian village that has been stricken with bad luck since the theft of their magical Sankara stones. Encouraged by the villagers to go to Pankot palace and retrieve the stones, Indy has no idea that what he will find involves an evil cult hell-bent on taking over the world with their lunatic new religion.<br /><br />Temple of Doom is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best Indiana Jones film. I know a lot of nerds are going to disagree with me but I do think it superior to Raiders of the Lost Ark because I prefer the darker, nastier tone and the fact that it just doesn't let up from the word 'go'! Two hours of Temple of Doom's running time pass in a breeze of sheer adventure as Spielberg takes us from one memorable set-piece to another. The opening musical number, the fight in the Obi-Wan Club, the chase through Shanghai, the plane crash/dingy ride, the journey to Pankot Palace, the dinner scene, the human sacrifice, the freeing of the slaves, the mine-cart ride, the water rush, the rope bridge, the cliff-hanging...wow! How much more can you pack into a film? It's physically impossible!<br /><br />Originally criticised on it's release for being too dark, Temple of Doom still ends up being a classic. I guess the audiences of 1984 were expecting Raiders of the Lost Ark 2 and were taken aback when they got something else. If you watch it with the others you can feel how different the film is with no scenes taking place in America, no University and no Sallah or Marcus Brody.<br /><br />John Williams' brilliant music is also at it's best. He even received an Academy Award nomination despite already being nominated for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, which is quite rare. The film did win an Oscar for its visual effects (beating the equally impressive effects of Ghostbusters) which, when viewed today, at least might seem a little bit dated, but still hold up quite well.<br /><br />Or course, there's nothing really important about the film. I mean it won't beat Schindler's List or Munich in terms of drama but if you want escapism and soaring, thrill-a-minute adventure his name is Indiana Jones and the place is the Temple of Doom.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade 3.5/5<br /><br />Summer 1989. I was 8 years old. I only managed 2 movies that summer, one being Ghostbusters 2 (which blew my eager young mind at the time) and Last Crusade (which also blew my mind). I don't think I could have asked for two bigger blockbusters to choose from. Having been a rabid child fan of Raiders and Temple of Doom all things Indy were fresh in my mind and even as an 8-year-old I truly 'got' Last Crusade.<br /><br />Set 2 years after Raiders, and 3 years after Temple of Doom, Last Crusade opens with a flashback to Indy's youth and an aggravating cameo by River Phoenix in the role. His anachronistic hair, androgynous physiognomy, and that fact that he looks absolutely nothing like Harrison Ford take me out of the film every time, and spoils the long opening scene for me. The opening does nothing apart from establish all of Indy's trademarks (the hat, the whip, the scar, the fear of snakes), which he apparently all got within five minutes. Luckily the film soon jumps forward to 1938 and the opening quickly is forgotten about as shady antique collector Walter Donovan encourages Indy to go after the Holy Grail.<br /><br />With Der Fuhrer also after the sacred chalice Indy must once again face off against the despicable Nazis, rescue his bumbling father (Sean Connery, having the time of his life), and keep one step ahead of Donovan with Sallah and Brody tagging along.<br /><br />There is loads of inventive, exciting action in many exotic, breath-taking locations and all of it is immaculately photographed by Douglas Slocombe in lovely anamorphic Panavision. Even with today's many advancements in movie camera technology you'll rarely see a film as beautifully photographed as this. All very high-key, mind you, the polar opposite of the dark, subterranean Temple of Doom.<br /><br />Now, herein lies my only gripe with Last Crusade (other than River Phoenix) is the fact that it's just too light-hearted. Spielberg expressed regret over the fact that he made Temple of Doom very dark and mean-spirited (which I don't agree with as it is my personal favorite) so he compensated by making Last Crusade more cheerful and bright. It's not an annoying shift in tone, but it could have been balanced out with a bit more blood and gore.<br /><br />Last Crusade makes the perfect end to the real Indiana Jones trilogy. Spielberg really should have left it as our hero, his dad, and his two sidekicks rode off into the sunset. How can you top that? How can you come back from that? But 19 years later he tarnished many reputations and spoiled many memories with the deeply, DEEPLY misjudged Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br /><br />It was an amazing film to see as a child, and it's a shame that kids these days are not exposed to anything as good. If you can turn a blind eye to River Phoenix you will surely have a great time with Last Crusade. It's not the Snake Car on the train he ought to worry about, it's the Viper Room on Sunset Boulevard.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull 1.5/5<br /><br />14 syllables in that title!<br /><br />What an immense disappointment this film was. After 19 years of waiting we deserved something better. I can't imagine what Spielberg was thinking when he threw this film together. It's a long, long way from the previous instalments in the franchise.<br /><br />Harrison Ford looks bored out of his mind, and who wouldn't be? It's not that he's too old or anything it's just that there is nothing much for him to do apart from spew loads of exposition (the previous films kept this to a minimum). Up until this instalment every Indy film had several key, iconic scenes. Be it a tumbling rock or a mine car chase there was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.<br /><br />The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up Die Hard 4 the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.<br /><br />Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark and grainy photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.<br /><br />I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the very poor script is nonsensical and circular, frequently using the titular skull as a tedious MacGuffin to push through any difficulties when the plot paints itself into a corner. It plain and simple doesn't make any sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script bloated with leftover scenes from Tomb Raider video games and abandoned puzzles from Channel 4's 1990s adventure show The Crystal Maze.<br /><br />Ray Winstone, as Mac, is the worst character in the film, there is so much wrong with Mac. His motivations and personality make me wince like chewing tin foil. Jim Broadbent, also hopelessly miscast, as a replacement for the late Denholm Elliot, is underwritten. His resignation at the beginning has no weight to it. We've just met the character, why should we care if he resigns to get Indy a paid suspension (a detail that is immediately forgotten)? Karen Allen returns as Marion but has next to nothing to do apart from drive a car-boat and tag along with the already bloated cast. Indy, Mutt, Mac, Ox and Marion all searching for an ancient treasure while being pursued by (a gorgeous) Cate Blanchett. My God is this ain't the friggin' Goonies, man.<br /><br />Despite the PG-13 rating it is probably the tamest Indy film yet. Look at the final scene in Raiders with the exploding heads and melting faces. How brilliant and timeless is that? It's pure imagination mixed with great make-up effects and it's a finale that everyone remembers. Irina Spalko (who does not one evil thing in the whole movie) meets an altogether much lazier fate. I won't ruin it for you despite already having given most of the ending away but I will say that it's quick and unaffecting and looks like it came out of a video game. You'll completely forget it 2 seconds after it happens.<br /><br />When all else fails you could usually turn to John Williams for comfort. Sorry folks, but Williams (along with everyone else, it seems) is strictly phoning it in for this one. His themes are lazy, boring and instantly forgettable. Don't expect anything as awesome as 'Parade of the Slave Children' or 'Desert Chase' here. The Ark of the Covenant theme can be heard near the start but all the new material is as bland as it can get.<br /><br />Indy IV should never have happened. At this point in his career Steven Spielberg is just surrounded by Yes Men. Paramount wanted a new Indy movie and cut him way too much slack. Raiders was shot very quickly, with a devil-may-care attitude, giving it a rough, grainy edge that worked only in his favor. Spielberg fought against many comprises and still delivered a classic. Now, after years of final cuts, after so many CGI quick fixes, with no outside forces curbing his excess, he's gone soft, and fat, and he's completely lost his edge.<br /><br />Spielberg has lost it. And this unnecessary film is the proof.<br /><br />All four movies are presented in virtually perfect 2.35:1 1080p HD with near faultless DTS HD-MA 5.1 sound. The older movies look brilliant, especially some of the higher-key effects shots. You'll swear some of it was shot yesterday. However, I did notice some weird anomalies surrounding the tarantulas on Alfred Molina at the start of Raiders. Not sure if it is a problem on my end, but it is odd as Raiders had a massive restoration prior to release.<br /><br />Each individual disc only has a couple of trailers (there are no commentaries) with the bulk of the extras on Disc 5. Some of the extras from the 2008 KOTCS disc are absent, but I doubt anyone will really care about that.<br /><br />The other extras are as follows:<br /><br />On Set with Raiders of the Lost Ark<br /><br />An hour-long documentary in 1080p with lots of B-roll footage and deleted scenes in 1080p. All is presented in chronological order as Spielberg strives his way through the shoot. Very interesting stuff.<br /><br />Making the Films:<br /><br />The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)<br /><br />A great hour-long, Emmy-winning documentary shot on 16mm featuring on location interviews and insights into the making of virtually every part of the movie. The kind of honest, raw movie doc that you just don't get anymore.<br /><br />Unfortunately the focus seems to be on Raiders here, as the original, hour-long documentary of Temple of Doom (directed by Frank Marshall, nonetheless) is not featured on the disc.<br /><br />The Making of Temple of Doom (2003)<br /><br />A 41-minute retrospective documentary fills in for FrankMarshall's superior vintage doc. It uses a lot of Marshall's 16mm behind-the-scenes footage.<br /><br />The Making of the Last Crusade (2003)<br /><br />A 35-minute retrospective documentary featuring 16mm shot on location at the time. Sean Connery appears in interview and River Phoenix and Denholm Elliott appear on location discussing their roles. It's pretty good, and you can feel Spielberg's zeal for the movie even many years after it came out.<br /><br />The Making of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008)<br /><br />\\"And here we use nasty CGI.\\"<br />\\"And here we use nasty CGI.\\"<br />\\"And here we use nasty CGI.\\"<br />\\"And here we use a green screen, so nothing you see is real.\\"<br />\\"And here we use nasty CGI.\\"<br /><br />Spielberg explains why he thought tarnishing Indy's legacy with an extremely poor sequel was a good idea to begin with. It lasts for 28 minutes, which is time you can spend doing something more productive, like cleaning out the bowl of a public toilet with a three-haired toothbrush and some spit.<br /><br />Behind-the-scenes:<br /><br />The Stunts of Indiana Jones - a 10-minute piece detailing how the pulled off some of the action. It's quite superficial but covers many of the main set-pieces.<br /><br />The Sound of Indiana Jones - a 13-minute piece featuring the work of Ben Burtt, the sound designer for the Indy movies. Burtt himself explains how he came up with all of the effects. Interesting if you practice this kind of thing.<br /><br />The Music of Indiana Jones - 12-minute piece with interviews with John Williams and Steven Spielberg. There is a lot of old footage showing them working together with Williams explaining his logic behind the music.<br /><br />The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones - 12-minute piece focusing on ILM and the special effects of the movies, back when everything was either done in-camera or optically, which I refer to \\"the good old days\\" before CGI wrecked E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.<br /><br />Raiders: The Melting Face! - an 8-minute piece detailing the famous melting face of Toht as he witnesses the Wrath of God in Raiders. Chris Walas (who's career was ruined by the advent of CGI) was the man responsible and is featured in an interview.<br /><br />Indiana Jones and the Creepy Crawlies - a 12-minute feature (with optional pop-up trivia) detailing the snakes, bugs, and rats of the first three movies. It seems to have been shot during the shoot for KOTCS judging by the clothes of the actors interviewed.<br /><br />Travel with Indiana Jones: Locations - a 10-minute piece detailing all of the locations and stand-in locations around the world where the movies were filmed. Again it features a pop-up trivia track and appears to be filmed during the shoot for KOTCS.<br /><br />Indy's Women: The American Film Institute Tribute - a 9-minute feature with Karen Allen, Kate Capshaw, and Allison Doody on stage discussing their characters before an audience. Shot in 2003.<br /><br />Indy's Friends and Enemies - a 10-minute piece detailing all of his sidekicks and recurring characters. It covers a lot of the same ground as the previous featurette as half of it is about Indy's girlfriends.<br /><br />Iconic Props - a superficial 10-minute piece detailing MacGuffins and famous wardrobes from all four movies. Too much focuses on KOTCS. The Ark of the Covenant barely gets a look-in while time is spent on Shia LeBeouf's comb?<br /><br />The Effects of Indy - a 22-minute piece focusing on the timeless optical effects of the first three movies (for about 30 seconds) and the garish, ugly CGI of the fourth for the rest of the running time. They actually spend time on discussing the prairie dog nonsense from KOTCS!<br /><br />Adventures in Post Production - a 12-minute piece detailing the post-production of KOTCS. If you care about this film then go for it. I personally find anything to do with it very difficult to sit through.was something standout and memorable about all of them. There's nothing like that here, nothing.<br /><br />The pre-release hype reminded me a lot Bruce Willis talking-up Die Hard 4 the previous summer. He assured that the film would be 'old school' and was 'the best one yet'. And then when it did finally come out it was a PG-13 family movie filled with CGI effects. So much for old school. Spielberg tried to hype Indy IV with the same logic. He'd be shooting in Panavision (sadly not as common as it used to be), editing the old-fashioned way and using as many non-computer-generated effects as possible.<br /><br />Well, that turned out to be a lie. Crystal Skull looks far too slick to be in the same category as Douglas Slocombe's fantastically dark and grainy photography of the first three. Not only is CGI prevalent throughout there is also extensive use of digital mattes which look totally out of place in an Indy film. In no way does this look or feel like either of the three movies that preceded it.<br /><br />I have read that Frank Darabont wrote the original script which both Spielberg and Ford loved but George Lucas hated it. I have no idea what that script was about but I have no doubt that it was miles better than what we finally got. Aliens simply do NOT belong in an Indy film. Lucas can force that nonsense on us in his endless Star Wars series as much as he wants but not here, Sir. And on top of that the very poor script is nonsensical and circular, frequently using the titular skull as a tedious MacGuffin to push through any difficulties when the plot paints itself into a corner. It plain and simple doesn't make any sense and is very poorly delivered to the viewer, excessive exposition or not. Indy IV feels more like a rejected Mummy 3 script bloated with leftover scenes from Tomb Raider video games and abandoned puzzles from Channel 4's 1990s adventure show The Crystal Maze.<br /><br />Ray Winstone, as Mac, is the worst character in the film, there is so much wrong with Mac.

B00AM0C6YG|5.0|Once in a while something completely different comes along and turns current popular music on its head. Laura Mvula is one of those people. She has appeared on the music scene pretty much as a fully-formed artist  with a unique concoction of influences from Nina Simone to The Beach Boys which gives you faith that great music will always surface every so often.<br />Brilliant, I can't wait to hear ( and see) what she does next.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I knew practically nothing about the right and left hemispheres of the brain, and was so interested in what Ms. Taylor had to say.  I have already begun to think in terms of the two brains, and look forward to learning more.  Ms. Taylor's information on how she controls how and what she thinks is fascinating.
3937406328|5.0|I didn't actually realise that this set came as a fairly sizeable book (duh!). Blue Guitars is a labour of love, and it shows. Rarely, if at all, have I known an artist to produce 11cd's of great songs. It's an interesting journey. The book, with it's paintings and an in -depth interview with Chris Rea, are almost a throwback to the old vinyl days of studying the album sleeve as you listen to the music. Rea's slide playing has never sounded better and his dark brown 'trombone ' of a voice carries you through the journey from the source of the blues through slavery, into the various manifestations of it up to the '60-70s. Great stuff.<br />A minor point - The CD sleeves in the book are VERY FRAGILE so will not stand up to too much use.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This was a nice little surprise with a lot of the songs sounding like the old days. Worth the money.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|I first heard Tame Impala on a MOJO compilation which made me want to investigate further. If you like a kind of 'retro psychedelic rock' but with a truly authentic feel, then check these guys out. Recommended.
B000FBJAOG|2.0|I basically liked the book.  But I read most of Kindle books on my Blackberry Kindle.  For the first time ever, I found sections of the book missing.  For example, Brooks would start a list.  I'd see #1, #2 and then it would end at the bottom of a page mid-sentence and jump to #4 on the next page.  I suspect this might relate to illustrations in the original text.  I also have a Kindle for my PC.  I eventually downloaded it there and discovered that all the missing text did appear.  But it's not worth it to go back through the whole book looking for the missing parts.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|My grandson couldn't play it because it is too large. Even after I dumped half of my apps it still too large
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read this best seller(!) just because it was a best seller, and was recommended everywhere. I wasted my time! Better to pass time by perusing some classics!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book kept me up way past my bedtime on more than one night. The fascinating history of the orphaned children with no real \\"system\\" for placement combined with the vivid characterizations kept me \\"next paging\\" on my Kindle.<br /><br />Get this book, I am so glad I did.
B004ELSDZK|1.0|Like it says in the title. Why is this in the free section if you have to pay $1.99 for it?
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love the app,  but I wish you could use redstone, have levers,  iron bars, and all of the stuff the real version has. That's why I can't rate this a 5 star app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I loved the ice age movies, and the game is definitely cute! Addictive and easy to play, I'd recommend it!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The story was pretty predictable.  There was enough excitement at the end to keep it in the 4 star area.
0762188618|5.0|One of the best of Ken Follett's suspense novels. I couldn't stop for a minute reading it. I love his style too.
096798467X|5.0|Even though we haven't built our oven yet, this book has amazing detail on how to get it done. Still in the planing stage with our oven, and rounding up supplies, but am confidant that we will be able to build a useable bread/pizza oven this fall.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Great experience for a decent price.  I wish that some of the textbook versions that are electronic were a little more reasonable in price. Amazon is great.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I like this emotional read because like many sad media about illness, it lends perspective to moments worth focusing on.  I step away from reading this wanting to appreciate the simple because the rest, the inevitable is clouded in my own worries and fears.  Life will happen.  Death will happen.  But pay attention to the present and value that time, because it continually ceases to exist.
B00C2VIA52|1.0|I HATE games that require in app purchases to advance. This mindset is ruining game playing and for that matter many areas of capitalistic endeavour...capitalism only works if both parties get value from the purchase. Atttention all developers! I wont buy stuff in the app. I woukd rather pay 5 dollars or even 6 or 10 dollars and get an entire app....this tricking me in with free apps but requiring in app purchases to advance is crap.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Very nicely put together.  Brutish as to be expected, but a semi democratic society was interesting. Hope the seasons continue for awhile.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I have always been intrigued by the paranormal, this show never disappoints and always leaves me wanting to watch the next episode.  The show enlightens the viewer with the vulnerability of a great mind.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This is one of the games I like to play.  It is easy and fun and can go by fast.  I play this at least two times a day
B00621ENT0|5.0|This show had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Trying to figure out what was going on was part of the fun! I think I understood the ending.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I can tell you that the book was much better then the movie.  I found the movie to be a little slow.  Not good acting
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Good dancing mixed with good acting.  A nice coming of age story.  I really enjoyed it and may see it again.
B007N8RULO|2.0|Someone else played this game.  It looked interesting, but it wasn&#34;t something I would play if I had the time to do so
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Strong lead character that handled his business like everyone should.  Samuel Jackson gave an excellent and memorable performance.  I'm going to buy this movie.  I highly recommend it.
B005UG542S|5.0|I love watching all the Harry Potter movies and watching it on amazon without comercials was great. I would recomend you to try it out,
B009186E3O|5.0|This is superb. A great fun. I love it. I've had never had a chance to view the movie, although I always heard people tell about it. It is even better than what I used to hear about it.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I almost cried when  I reached the end! The twist ending  left me wanting so much more. Cant wait for the next one.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Simple puzzle-ish type of game for any age to play. Graphics are awesome! A game you can pick up and play any time as it won't require your full attention.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is very fun and I suggest everyone to dowload it. A+ in my book...very easy to download and the whole family can enjoy plaing.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is fun on any phone/tablet device. Simple fun concept of cutting fruit with awesome graphics! The different modes help give a bit of variety because the game can get boring(like when it first came out)
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I always prefer it when she sings, but I will settle for a comedy I guess!!!
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Lee Child has been one of my favorite author's. but after barely being able to get thru this book he has been lowered a notch. Is he writing just for the $$$??
B0053O89KG|5.0|Just love the show, the characters and the plots. One of my favorite shows on Tv.<br />What else is there to say?
B009LMTDL0|4.0|While the stats demonstrating that woman are disadvantaged, discriminated against and typically self flagellating are helpful reminders of the social challenges faced by woman, Sandberg's specific examples on how to built self awareness, change our habits and move forward to build equality are solid and as essential for a college student as it is for a 50 year old working professional.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I am soooo obsessed with anything Jane Austin.  This is more detailed than any other production I have see.  Love Johnny Lee Miller.  So good.  Don't miss this one.
B00A3AY134|5.0|Then you will love the greatest hits. Great collection of some of their best songs. Good choice if you are looking for something to capture the sound of 3DD, but don't want to listen to all of their albums or are not a huge fan, but like their popular songs.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|Great production.  Beautifully set and the English countryside is magnificent. Costumes and acting in the best ever.  Do not miss this one.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Controller came like new like was stated but after a few uses, I heard a piece of plastic rattling around inside. Other than that its a great product and will definitely purchase another
0812982622|4.0|I think this is a good book but I do not think it worthy of a Pulitzer. Many Americans, like me, are drawn into a book like this just because they are fascinated by North Korea, if for no other reason than its obscurity. I think that accounts for much of the book's popularity, as long as we can believe its curtain-pulling is based mostly on hard facts and not just the author's imagination. But I always downgrade a work of fiction for failure to tie up loose ends, and, were I on the Pulitzer Committee would point out the following ones for this work:<br /><br />1. Did the Dear Leader figure out how the camera worked when \\"Commander Ga\\" (Jun Do) failed to produce copies of the photos as requested? It is hinted at, but never explicitly stated, that he did, but we're mostly given to speculate on that.<br /><br />2. Whatever happened to Second Mate? Was this left as a mystery for literary reasons or just because the author just didn't want to bother to follow up on it?<br /><br />3. How did Jun Do manage to keep his camera hidden from the guards during the entirety of his incarceration?<br /><br />4. Who was Mongnan, really? There's some suggestion she's actually Jun Do's mother, but the facts are never revealed to us.<br /><br />And finally, and most importantly:<br /><br />5. Did Sun Moon and/or her kids live or die? The author points out the failure to cut air holes in the barrels in which they were smuggled onto the cargo plane, and it's fairly clear that they left on that plane, but we never know in what condition they arrived at their destination. It's hard to believe that this last one isn't deliberate, but I can't for the life of me figure out why the author left us hanging.<br /><br />By the way, I do NOT object to his flash-back-flash-forward technique, but it's one thing to leave questions unanswered temporarily in pursuit of that technique; it's quite another never to answer those questions at all.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable and fascinating, if flawed, read.d, read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A completely erotic read but I found some of the prose juvenile. At first I thought it was written by George Takei (oh, my!). I would recommend this book.
B002PMPTIO|2.0|i love the movie.  the version you can stream off amazon is distractingly crappy.  lots of glare, as if the digitization went wrong somewhere
B008AX1HD8|3.0|Not in the same class as,say,  &#34;Smylas Sense of Snow&#34; though Nesbo is obviously very familiar with the Sydney and Australian locale and a non resident would probably find the situational descriptions interesting.  The problems are in the construction and the credibility of the plot.  It is very hard to believe that a foreign police officer would be able to act with the authority and local knowledge that Nesbo has given Hole within five minutes of arriving in Sydney.  Sydney police are OK but not that self effacing.<br />I have a suspicion though that Nesbo's subsequent works will show a steep learning curve and, to that extent the reading of one or two more will probably be worthwhile.
B00271DNP4|1.0|We finally stopped it.  I am afraid that was my last streamed movie from amazon.  Irritating!!!!!  Next time we just go rent the movie.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|My boys enjoy playing it everywhere we go. We have not encountered any problems with it so far. I give it a five.
030746363X|5.0|I love Tim Ferris' minimalist approach to sculpting the perfect body.  I've tried many different weight lifting workouts in my life with mixed results.  Using Tim's minimalist 4 hour approach I've gained more sculpted muscle with A LOT less work.  The hardest thing about following his workout routine is the feeling at the end of the short workout that you could do way more than what the workout recommends, but after following both the workout and the rest routine I've seen faster gains than I've ever had.<br /><br />The diet he recommends is nothing new.  It's basically the slow carb diet, but he does bring a lot of additional \\"techniques\\" to the table in terms of the minimal things you should do to achieve the biggest gains (like 30g of protein before 30 minutes of being awake).<br /><br />All in all it's probably the best all purpose body book I've ever read.
B008133DO8|3.0|I love period Holmes stories, but nearly every attempt to modernize the iconic detective falls flat -- until this series. I absolutely fell in love with Season 1 of \\"Sherlock.\\"  Moffatt does a brilliant job of moving the characters into the 21st century and making them believable.<br /><br />That said, I expected to love Season 2 with the same relish. \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" was an imaginative update to the original. I greatly prefer McAdams' more nuanced performances as Irene Adler to Pulver's. It's not that Pulver does badly; she just doesn't really have much of a characterization. I couldn't help wondering whether Adler's dominatrix  predilections were created just to allow her to make the bad pun that she \\"beat Sherlock Holmes.\\"<br /><br />I also enjoyed \\"The Hounds of Baskerville,\\" in spite of the government facility being so far-fetched.  Maybe it's because I like the the glowing bunny, even though a secure facility could never mix up test subjects with domestic pets. Despite these silly aspects, the updated story is still self-consistent and entertaining.<br /><br />I really wanted to love the whole of Season 2, but Steve Thompson's \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" is an utterly disappointing ending to the season. Not only does the story seem botched, the characters (particularly that of Moriarty) maintain little or no credibility. Only Watson's character remains somewhat true.  Unfortunately, that's not enough to keep this episode from lowering my rating for this season.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable works well with the adapter I bought for fast charge.  Makes my Kindle accessible to a plug wherever I am.  Well worth the money spent for it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was an excellent movie.  I really hope there will be a second movie.  The movie did a great job portraying the spirit of the original stories idea.
B003JTHXOK|1.0|Everyone always raves about Nicholas Sparks books so I finally read one.  The writing leaves much to be desired.  Pre-teen style...predictable...boring!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I really love this game. I used to have to play it on my moms iphone, but now its on my kindle. I could play this for hours.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|A little slow to pull me in at first but really like how it plays out. I loved Gone Girl so I had to go back for another.  Not as good as Gone Girl, but still an interesting ready.
0547572298|4.0|When a bomb explodes on Luna and kills Glen Runciter, head of an anti-psi prudence organization, the world begins reversing in time and his team of anti-telepaths dying off one after another, shriveling up and decaying into dregs. The new leader, Joe Chip, must keep Runciter in half-life, the mind continuing to work while the body suspended and decaying, find the cause even as he began to decay. Through his half-dead boss, Joe realizes only Ubik, a mysterious spray, could save his life, but an evil force seeks to prevent him from getting hold of the cure.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick's futuristic tale of telepaths and precogs takes the reader into a surrealistic world of time reversal and pseudo-science. Like other successful sci-fi writers, he creates a compelling world where the readers are willing to suspend their beliefs and experience coin-slotted doors and refrigerators with attitudes. Joe Clip isn't likeable but the twists in plot lead the reader guessing on the causes of the changes and what Ubik is. A fun sci-fi read.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. I love to watch this at least once a week. Good story and an outstanding cast. A movie I will never tire of watching.
B0097EWK3A|3.0|The game play was very slow.  There was a lot of scene jumping and sometimes you had to go through 10+ areas multiple times to get the items
B0050DZ8J0|2.0|I am constantly agrevated by the Linkedin App. You have to sign in everytime. It doesn't have an option to remember or keep you logged in. Very frustrating when you are on the go.
B000065V42|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Kids are small in a big yard trying to find their way to the house while going through many obstacles just like bugs have to. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes adventures.
B002APU580|4.0|Good rendition of an old thick book.  The family and characters were brought off the pages by fine professional actiing.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I loved the first season of Fringe. The limitless imagination and creative writing made for one the best experiences I had since watching my first science fiction movie. The assembled cast is wonderful. This season is worth of a yearly marathon, I loved it that much.
B004Q3RKH8|1.0|The re-mastered version of this album does not sound good at all. Sounds like a bootleg copy. Fuzzy and unclear.
B00CW665VI|5.0|First off let me say well done Miss Chase!! I absolutely love the man's point of view!! Drew was hilarious and I love his Witt and charm... I will tell all my friends this is a great book and they should definitely read it!!! Waiting for the next book you have in store for us:)

B002I9Z8I0|4.0|I know the world is moving toward blue ray, but i don't think it's right to hold out on people who pay top money for dvd collections. upon watching my boxset i found out that most of the special features were resdrved for the blue ray set. it arived on time and in perfect condition, all in all a  great addiition to my collection.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|I honestly kept thinking of things I could be doing while watching. It was that bad...I'm sorry I wasted my time.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book was heartbreaking. I love how much I was sucked into reading it. I could not put it down. I would recommend this to anyone who loved Romeo and Juliet. Definitely a winner.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I couldn't put it down - the author seems to have captured the human experience brilliantly. I recommend it highly.
B007TNQ7EY|3.0|The 8 because it fun but driving is buggy and camera is ok but love it bring more updates and new games that won't money
B001L5VYFI|4.0|Self indulgent live offering from some of the music business's premiere primadonnas.  Still an excellent band offering stellar harmonies and impeccable musicianship.  Love the Neil stuff the most.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|The best movie ever. it has good movation story line. and it is based on a true story. soul surfer
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The National has for a very long time been an amazing band who can produce and create such intricate beautiful songs packed with force and build-ups and interesting/quirky lyrics that have kept me coming back for years. Of course Alligator, Boxer, and High Violet all stand out as some of their best works...but oh. my. god.<br />This album?? Trouble Will Find Me?? In a word: Wow. In four words: They have outdone themselves.<br /><br />They literally have outdone themselves. This album is fantastic from start to finish but it also DEFINITELY grows on you. The more you listen to it the more you love it and it is just so well done and Matt is singing in the lowest and highest ranges he's ever been in and it's fantastic. It is just one excellent song after another and I can't pick a favourite. I do really love \\"This is the Last Time\\" and \\"Pink Rabbits\\".<br /><br />Just outstanding. Not many albums deserve a 5 star rating. But this may be the first album in a long time that actually truly and fully deserves 5 stars. I am wonderfully in love with this album.<br /><br />Of course all of the above only applies if you enjoy this type of music, and ESPECIALLY if you've been a fan of the national for a while and love to see how they are progressing. This is in my opinion their best work to date, or at least my favourite for now.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Who doesn't love &#34;The Hobbit&#34;?  The movie was well done and followed the book pretty well. Everyone in my family, from young to old, thoroughly enjoyed the movie in the theater and even more so at home. We've watched it numerous times and have been entertained every last time. Some scenes might be intense for young viewers, but, as it's on DVD, you could just skip through those parts. The extras on the Blu-Ray/DVD are worth watching as well.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a good; useable; working app for time.  I know longer need to pack an alarm clock when traveling. I would recommend this.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Wow! This movie brought back memories of our arcade game days. It's absolutely hysterical and filled with nostalgia. We were able to point out various games to our kids and even broke out the old Atari and Nintendo to show the kids how &#34;cool&#34; the graphics were then. The storyline was highly entertaining -- as all Disney's are. Wreck-It Ralph is tired of always being the bad guy. He decides the only way to enjoy life is become a hero (aka win a medal). He jumps his game and finds himself in another where he accidentally unleashes a &#34;bug&#34; that can destroy a game. At first, he is focused only on himself and his needs until he realizes there's more to his world than just being a bad guy or being a hero. Sometimes what we need most is a friend.<br />We laughed, we cried (from laughing so hard), we laughed some more. It was an awesome movie! We each have our favorite character and enjoy watching it over and over again. I believe this is one movie we will not soon tire of.
B009R89CRI|5.0|Bought this book for my 8yr old and he loves it so much....had it read in no time at all....definitely recommend....
0811879542|5.0|So when I first picked up &#34;Press Here&#34; I didn't like it as a storytime book. However, as we always read Building Block Nominees, we used this book in storytime with reservations. The results were shocking. It was the biggest hit ever! The kids (ages newborn - 10) called it &#34;The Magic Book&#34; and have asked for it time and time again when checking out books. We can't keep copies on the shelf - it's that popular. The book is engaging, instructive and creative. The child gets to interact with the reader by &#34;pressing&#34; the dots in the order the book asks, moving the book, or clapping their hands a certain number of times. As the child reads with you, you'll find that you are teaching them exactly how to follow directions with immediate rewards on each turned page. This book is a must have for every library. The very sturdy construction will make sure kids enjoy it for many reads to come. I believe our copies have checked out at least fifty times each since we added them and still are holding shape. (Library books tend to get more of a beating than regular books). I have given this book as a gift and will continue to do so. It really is an enjoyable read for everyone.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I do not like this app at all!!  Very general and does not have all my ebay info.  Tried to find one of my sellers I use often and there was no list like eBay.com.  I removed this app.
B000GXJHUA|5.0|I have to admit, I was not \\"Sin City's\\" biggest fan when it came out (which would now be called the theatrical cut. I liked the entire concept and the entire cast, but the ending part with the \\"yellow man\\" was kind of boring. However, this particular cut makes other parts longer and better, which makes up for one segment that looses it near the end. The star cast of Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Elijah Wood, Anna Paquin, Clive Owen, and many more make it worth all the while.<br /><br />You also get this cool additional comic book, which is where it all started, isn't it? Frank Miller also revamped Batman in the 80's with the Year One plot that became a basis for the excellent \\"Batman Begins\\" film. He also directed the highly underrated \\"Spirit\\" from his own idol that starred Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johanson. He also did the original comic of \\"300\\" and the prequel \\"Xerxes\\" (the latter which has been adapted into a sequel).<br /><br />If you are at all a fan of Frank Miller, anything he's ever written, check this edition out even if you saw the original version. This one is vastly superior, about 40 percent better in my opinion.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Piccoult bases her novel on the Columbine and other school shootings and shares the viewpoints of all involved in the tragedy.  With the recent murders in Sandy Hook, the importance of understanding the motivations of young shooters and the gun culture in our society is crucial.
B006N9XHLQ|5.0|I've read all of the Adrien (with an E) English books and a heap of other works by Josh Lanyon, but this is the series that I keep coming back to, time and time again. For all those budding M/M writers out there in this particular genre, this is how it's done. Build believable, slightly oddball, but totally endearing characters, throw in a bit of mystery, murder and suspense, and the occasional (it does not have to be in every chapter) hot sex scene, and you have a great ingredient for a crime story. In case you've not yet read any of the series, The Dark Tide is the last book. The order in which these should be read is:<br /><br />1. Fatal Shadows<br />2. A Dangerous Thing<br />3. The Hell You Say<br />4. Death of a Pirate King<br />5. The Dark Tide<br /><br />The way the relationship between English and Riordan builds from one book to the next is nothing short of masterful. Some female authors of M/M paint their male characters with sensitivities that are too overstated, too feminine, and while gay men are allowed to be more sensitive than their straight counterparts, they are still men. Lanyon knows this and gives just the right amount of sensitivity to his characters. And yes, having a closeted detective who longs to be straight despite his deep attraction to the other man is going to add tension to any story (and although I've read nothing similar, is probably not new), but the comfortably out and happy in his own skin English provides the perfect counterpart.<br /><br />Even the minor characters such as the Lisa, the overbearing English mother, Angus the grungy shop assistant and chain-smoking Detective Chan, Riordan's partner, are nicely fleshed out and readable.<br /><br />Best of all, Lanyon has a great self-deprecating humour that often had me chuckling out loud. Writing at its best, and if you are not sure whether to buy this or not, my advice is to dive in. As far as I'm concerned this was money well spent.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|Good Christmas gift for son in law who loves this sitcom, now has it even though off the air now
B004H7QICG|3.0|I had this couriered to the UAE costing three times the price of the original box. My mistake for doing so. But also theirs for not stating the original weight
B00BZOFUI2|5.0|What can I say,...I've never really written a review, but here goes. This is DEEP PURPLE !!! Great album, have they ever done a bad album ?? The only slight let down, and I do mean slight is the first track doesn't start off as the rocker it becomes. I would have thought they'd had used something with a bit more edge as a first track. But when it does kick in, it kicks butt. Gillans voice is as strong as ever, considering with the exception of Morse, these guys are all in their sixties ? Wow, rock on !!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The best one of the year !!! How did you guys do it if I had skills like guy dangers I would have been KILLED!!!!!<br />Thank you for this game

B009NG1Q96|4.0|The first book was a good ride and this continued along in the same manner.  The heroine is still very conflicted about her position in this new reality she has found herself in. I don't want to give it away, but the twists amd turns are good and unexpected. I found myself railing at some of her choices, thoughts, amd inferences which all indicate good storytelling!
B002GIBVWA|5.0|Enjoyed the emotional roller coaster of life, people, relationships... reality based movie... life experiences are based on each persons point of view.

B008CRC506|5.0|I purchased this for myself and what I have wastched so far I have liked and enjoyed.  I particularly wanted to see Katharine.
B005R5H876|5.0|This novel is a masterpiece. Ayn Rand, who was born Alice Rosenbaum in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1904, wrote captivating dialogical novels every bit as detailed and interwoven as the novels by Dostoevsky--though significantly more affirmative.<br /><br />She constructed her characters in a similar manner to the way in which Victor Hugo constructed the characters of his novels; that is, she created a smorgasbord of characters representative of different ideals whereby each one consciously and/or subconsciously acts in accordance with a specific philosophy and sense of life.<br /><br />As in real life, some of her characters vacillate between contradictory principles. Her main characters, however, are \\"ideal\\" types. In the course of the narrative they are brought together in situations in which their integrity is tested.<br /><br />This novel demonstrates how some people gauge their self-worth according to how others view them. Some rely on the evaluation of the opaque ubiquitous majority; some feel they need to subordinate others to themselves. Only the protagonist, Howard Roark, does not assess his self-worth and the meaning of his person according to how others evaluate him. He is the self-reliant individual.<br /><br />This is a novel of ideas in which their concrete implications are demonstrated in the actions of the characters. For those who believe that ideas have no consequences (psychological, social, economic, and political), this novel will not register. Those who understand otherwise, who seek and are self-creative, may find in this novel a treasure trove and a companion. Those whose souls are set ablaze by all that relates to the human spirit may find inspiration in this book.

B00BN3DPQ4|4.0|Missing from movie screens for 9 years with a mere cameo popping up here and there, Arnold Schwarzeneger has chosen a good script for his return in Director Kim Jee-Woon's 'THE LAST STAND'-2012, a modern day western in action genre clothing.  I approached this film in slight trepidation fearing for cliches abounding and making the film more of a satire than a serious genre outing and, boy, was I thrown for a loop.  Screenwriter Andrew Knauer keeps the films running time flowing with various twists and tragedies erupting at the most unexpected moments.  The acting is first rate for this type of film:  Eduardo Noriega gives his villainous drug cartel lord the right cutting edge; Forrest Whittaker gives the perfect touch of paranoia as the FBI agent in charge; Peter Stormare pumps the villainy even more; Jaime Alexander - Rodrigo Santiago and Lus Guzman give Arnold perfect team chemistry; and there is a brief cameo by veteran Harry Dean Stanton. The highlight of the film is a fantastic car chase through a huge corn field between Arnold and Noriega brilliantly edited by Steven Kemper and photographed by Ji Yong Kim amd is worth the price of the purchase alone making it join the ranks of unique action chases.  Lionsgate releases this gorgeous Blu-Ray in a nice 2.35 1080P transfer with DTS surround sound to give it the icing on the proverbial cake.  A ton of extras including a 'making of' featurette completes the package.  Highly recommended for all action fans, this outing is truly a surprise and gives director Kim's first American film a wonderful kinetic rush introduction to his work.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I purchassed this as a gift and have given it to the child but I am not sure if it has been watched or not.

B009G78EE2|4.0|I understand this is now one of the hottest seller albums in the country.  Good for them.  I am not a huge rap fan, but I got this because I wanted to support artists who come up with something like _Same Love_.  And who doesn't like _Thrift Shop_?  All told, a well put together effort.....
B00BHMF578|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen recently. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is very fun and addicting. there are a lot of cars and levels to buy so it willkeep you occupied for a long time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I started reading this book because a lot of people told me ok t was a good one and I had already downloaded it in my kindle as it truly interested me from the get go. I fell in the live with thus book cause it shows even when your life is in shambles, you can find that person that reminds you who you are inside and loves that person, which in turn reminds you to hold onto your hope in this world. I was blown away by how this story touched my heart and soul... I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!! Fall in love with Sky and Holder like just did and I promise you that you will also \\"live\\" all the supporting character s as well - ENJOY <3
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is one of the my lovable game where i had a good time ever. Yes, it is very addictive if you get into this for one time, you keep gaming like anything! I am using it with my kindle fire, it is really good.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I loved this game played it all the way through. You have to solve all the small puzzle hidden tricks to advance. I hope they expand upon this game, I almost never pay for apps but this one I would definitely pay for!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|Good movie. Jack Nicholson &#34;hines&#34; as Jack Torrance who slowly loses his mind while caring for a hotel in the off-season. This happens to be one of my favorite Stephen King Stories turned into a movie that stays true to the book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I may have found a new favorite author. Hugh Howey has written one of the best dystopian society series that I've had the pleasure of reading. I love the fact that you just don't know what is going to happen next; being one of the good guys gives no guarantee that you'll make it to the next chapter. Howey even made me understand the reasoning behind some of the actions of those who run the Silos.  I can't wait to see what happens in Silos 17 and 40!
B000WMFZMY|5.0|A huge fan of Charlton Heston since I was a little girl. This movie not only is a good account of history but it is beautifully performed by the entire cast.  El Cid unified a divided nation and brought together people through respect, honor and friendship.<br />A great Sunday afternoon movie and a long one too.  Enjoy!
B00COGXX7A|1.0|the movie is great but it froze and I had to unplug and rebut the roku box. It was very frustrating…..
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great character development.  Good chemistry between the actors.  Clever plots lines.  Great television that is intellectually stimulating.  Must watch t.v.
0142410705|4.0|Plot: The plot for Katherines was something not like something I have ever read, I have never seen a book incorporate math (and footnotes!!) the way John Green did. I hate math, was never any good at it, and I thought this would be the second John Green book I'd read that I would hate, but I was wrong. The math parts is a little overwhelming at time, and I did even skip a few of those pages, but it did not make the story less enjoyable. I thought the main plot would be just a road trip for the entire book and at first was disappointed when the road trip ended but this ended up being one of my favorites of the year! I loved finding out about why he only dated girls named Katherine and why each of the relationships didn't last.<br /><br />Characters: The characters in this book were really funny and they felt real which was my biggest problem with Paper Towns, none of the characters felt like they would exist. Colin is a great main character and I loved how 'nerdy' he was and how he acted around other people. Hassan, my favorite character, was so refreshing for YA, I loved his little quirks (I laughed at every mention of Judge Judy!). Lindsay and her mother were also welcome additions to the book.<br /><br />Overall: This book exceeded my expectations and I am really looking forward to reading more of John Green! The only downsides for me was too much math at parts, even though it fit the character perfectly, and too many footnotes at times. 4/5 Stars

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|You just can't wait to get through one book to get to the next. Awesome story. Interesting , exciting, gripping.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I purchased this game for my smartphone about a year ago.  My phone is older and can't handle the load without the hiccups.  I was thinking of buying a google 'Nexus' tablet since they run google play where I initially found the game.  I couldn't believe it when I deleted it from my phone and just happen to be browsing the Kindle app store and found this.  I bought a similar game, that was .99, but by far was lacking compared to this game.<br />If you're just sitting in bed watching tv and want something to do during commercials, this is the game to play, if you are in the Dr's office waiting for your appt, this is the game to play.  It's easy to play and challenging at the sametime; climbing hills without flipping, etc.  I play it everyday while my wife is watching her shows.  It's a great way to relax and have fun.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|A page turner you just can not put down. I read all three books in five days .Unexpected , Intriguing, Surprising
B00BN0BZVY|4.0|This was a great read.  I didn't want to put the book down.  I really wanted to know what happened with Nikki!  I don't think the ending was a big shocker, but it worked, and I liked the fact that it wasn't ridiculous or unrealistic.  This story translates so much better in print than on the screen.  Because the characters have so much internal dialogue going on, it simply doesn't work in a movie.  The movie strays so far from the book, I was angry all the way through viewing it! If you never read the book, I suppose the movie is okay, but I recommend the book!
B0052U59F4|5.0|the author is such a talented strong writer. She has written three fantastic books that is sure to get and hold anyone's attention that gives the books a chance. I read this book after seeing a piece on NBC that spoke of how controversial this new book was so I decided to check it out and I was not disappointed. I was blown away with how finely written this story was in each book it the story just got better and better. I would highly recommend this trilogy to EVERYONE!!!

B009UAO1ZG|5.0|This is a fascinating account of the turbulent years at the beginning of World War II and the personal battle between President Roosevelt and national hero, Charles Lindbergh. The country was split between those who wanted to provide aid to Britain and those who wanted no part in the European war. The book reveals that President Roosevelt was very indecisive, and showed a lack of leadership in 1940-41, because he wanted the people behind him before he acted. Everything changed after December 7, 1941 and even Lindbergh renounced his earlier support for Germany. It was a surprise to learn that Lindbergh, as well as supporting Germany earlier in the war, was also anti semitic and a supporter of eugenics.<br />It was also a surprise to learn that after the war, Lindbergh was a philanderer, with three mistresses in Germany with whom he fathered seven children ! He already had fathered six children with wife Anne. Lindbergh was never held in the same esteem by the American people, as in his earlier years. While Roosevelt was alive, he was 'persona non grata' but after 1945 he was accepted into the US Airforce Reserve. The book also gives interesting insights into Wendell Wilkie, Roosevelts opponent in the 1940 elections, and the behaviour of the top military brass in those early war years.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|I loved it. Well, of course I loved it. Because, really, who does not love Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson?
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Though I didn't see much news on this movie as far as leading up to it I will admit that after watching I had to purchase it and have watched it many times over since.  I highly recommend this movie and hope that there is a sequel Warlord of Mars!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Eric Blehm did a great job writing this book. this was a book that I had a hard time putting down.
B006ID01OS|4.0|A quick read that helped me distill parts of the strategist role into a clearer picture. The examples provided were helpful in putting business purpose definition into practice and the focus on viewing strategy as an on going process is useful. I would recommend this book to students heading into any business strategy or entrepreneurship course as well as anyone considering the importance of strategy on a day to day basis for their business. On the other hand, I would not recommend this book for someone trying to dive deep into strategy creation or strategic alignment because the book lacks depth in these two areas. Not a criticism, as you can't boil the ocean in one book.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|I like this a lot....protects the phone and still allows me to put the phone in my pocket.  easy to assemble
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This movie gave the feeling of comradery we would experience in the original Star Trek. Something I did not feel in the first one. True, there are many differences, that Gene might not be so happy about. There is a greater feel of action and daring, as well as fly by the seat of your pants in JJ Abrahms Star Trek. With Gene's Star Trek, there was a greater need to think and use one's brains before brawn. Here is quite the opposite. Now don't get me wrong, I loved this movie from star to finish. But, there were things I had many issues with. I have been blasted for spoilers in the past, so I won't go into the details, but needless to say, if you are expecting Shatner's James Tiberius Kirk, you won't find him here. Though, Quinto's Spock in my opinion is dead on. He plays Spock perfectly. While I love the new Scotty, he is no where near the Scotty we all knew and loved, played by James Doohan. I am already ordering this so that I can watch it again and again. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes the Star Trek universe (different as it may be) or just likes plain action/science fiction. *******SPOILER ALERT****** I will say that we get to see a whole new take on many aspects of the original Star Trek, for instance this movie has Khan Noonian Sing, (remember him) along with modified (yet again) Klingons. And a very inspiring yet (I felt) ripped off death sequence towards the end, with some roll reversal. I don't want to give away anymore of the story so I had to erase what I just typed. You will also get to see a lovers quarrel (sort of) between Uhura and Spock. Very interesting take on Vulcan emotions. ******Spoiler alert over******  Listen, see the movie, you'll be glad you did, then you will want to come right back to Amazon.com and buy it, I guarantee it. It's just that good.<br /><br />Ralph J. Fitcher A lifelong Star Trek fan.

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Normally into faster racing type games, but this one's kinda addicting. Definitely worth a try if you are looking to kill some time.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|These are wonderful on 3D TV; the colors and so beautiful and the animals look like you can reach right out and touch them.  This is a wonderful set! :)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I found this book very enjoyable.  The love  Eben's family had for him was truly amazing. I was also adopted and met my birth family years later.  The medical facts behind Ebens' Proof of Heaven have me definitely leaning towards believing there is  an Afterlife.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|This movie was so cool in 3D!  Sometimes it looked like the monsters were coming out of the TV to get ya.  I love 3D movies that are on the 3D TV! :)
B00338QENI|5.0|Rebecca Skloot does a wonderful job of combining medical science with the personal lives of Henrietta Lacks descendants. It is a story that I won't forget.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|In enjoy everything about this show. The time period, the cast is spectacular! We have not seen all of season 2. We try to watch them sparingly, as not to run out ,)
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I was first impressed by how easy the case was to attach to my Kindle Fire.  Then was surprised by how easy it was to remove.<br />Pros:  lightweight, easy on and off, elastic band works great<br />Cons: stand is not as stable as I would like it to be, case is showing wear after only three months<br />Good value for the money
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Highly watchable, but it cannot match the classic Dr. Strangelove IMO, as some have claimed.  Also, unlike some other Reviewers, the 1.78 Ratio worked perfectly & filled the entire Screen of my HD Widescreen TV using an LG Blu-Ray Player.  Viewing in this Ratio is far superior to the \\"chop\\" formats.<br /><br />It seems like there is no in-between for Viewers/Reviewers of this Movie.  Love it or Hate it, and count me in the Love Camp.  That's not because I like the Characters or the topic:  I don't.  But, it is because of the spellbinding characterizations & jarring implications.  There is some subtlety but it is overcome by the Blunt-Force Trauma of the story -- beginning with the absolutely stunning & unforgettable opening \\"Bullet\\" sequence.<br /><br />I doubt that I will ever forget 3 Statements from Arms Dealer Yuri's (Nicolas Cage's) monologues.  First, that: 1 person in 12 owns a Weapon, and he (& other Arms Dealers) want the other 11 for Customers.  Next, he jokes that his \\"biggest Competitor is the President of the United States\\".  Finally I cannot forget his (new to me) concept that \\"The AK-47 is the real Weapon of Mass Destruction\\".  Wow!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Lord of War, and highly recommend it.  It is very thought provoking.  Also, all-in-all, this is a very serious Movie with comedic moments.  It should be on every Adult's \\"Must-Watch\\" List -- but it is absolutely not for the young ones.<br /><br />I'm heading off to watch it again.
B003U6HQGW|5.0|I saw the movie of this book and found it interesting. The book impressed me much much more. The detail is amazing and the tale a true story of the human spirit and what it is capable of. This story will stay with you forever.
0786955570|5.0|great quality of the board, characters, markers and cards. The instructions are fairly easy to read and follow. Really good design for a fun challenge. LOTS of gaming scenarios for groups and single run through. The first time we played it we ran the monsters wrong and made the game too simple, but after reading the rule book section more carefully, it was a blast and more of a challenge!!! One of the best things is that the D&D DM feel is still there, but the time spent building the scenarios is out and everyone can play without someone required to DM. Story lines are super fun! Wish there were more than 5 players available, but then again it would take that much longer if there were more characters; and one of the joys of this game is you can play a Dungeon dive in less than 2 hours with minimal set up. That is great for a group of married with children friends who want to play but have not the extra extra hours to pour into the set up of a normal D&D.<br />great figures, you could paint if you really wanted to, but no need.<br />VERY FUN! worth having for a great, fast, and more simplified dungeon run<br />every now and then things like line of sight and other common D&D basics are jeopardized just to simplify the board, but it does not diminish the game which we were worried about.<br />The board is ever changing based on tiles, which makes every run a new and different experience!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|My only complaint about this album is that after listening to it, I was forced to get reconstructive plastic surgery because IT MELTED MY FACE OFF
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Just perfect for my kindle. I can see everything like or as if I was on the computer. Really brings out pictures. I like seeing comments.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging, beautiful puzzles; reminded me of the classic Myst PC game.  Intuitive enigmas, progressive storyline.  Eager for the game to continue through sequels!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My sister and I are addicted to this show!  This season has a bunch of twists and turns and i even shed some tears.  My sister and I are trying to get my mother to watch this show.  I can't wait for next season to start!

B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game has been for the daily for years and when I got my kindle, I hoped for it to be in the app store and it was! But I always see polka dotted bath tubs with wings for some reason.
B0017HEYEI|5.0|Not only did I purchase (used) Snow White but I also bought a Disney set of 13 x 3\\" figures.  My granddaughter will freak out to act out with the little figures while watching the movie. Unfortunately, when the DVD showed up, it was in Korean. Yes, you can change it to English, but I can't understand Korean to choose the English version. I contacted Amazon and they were so helpful and took care of things immediately. I now have the English version. Thanks Amazon

0385349947|5.0|This book is kind-of the \\"it\\" book for working women right now, and for good reason. It is well-organized, easy to read, and full of both research and personal stories (the former to validate the stories, the latter so you'll remember the lessons). It acknowledges the institutional barriers to gaining further equality for women, while also pointing out that there are some things men and women can do themselves, right now, to help women break through the glass ceiling that is very much still present.<br /><br />If you've seen Sheryl Sandberg's TEDTalk, this book is an expansion of those three points. This book is about women at work in general, not just about working moms, although the tendency of society to expect mothers to shoulder more of the childcare burden has far-reaching implications. For women currently working outside the home or about to embark on their careers, just the knowledge of the kinds of issues they might face will help them be more conscious and conscientious, and possibly help them avoid some common mistakes. For men in the workforce, knowing what issues women face will help you acknowledge your bias, the prerequisite to correcting for it.<br /><br />The point most important to me was that all available research indicates that whether a mom works outside or inside the home has little bearing on how their children turn out. \\"Parental behavioral factors--including fathers who are responsive and positive, mothers who favor 'self-directed child behavior,' and parents with emotional intimacy in their marriages--influence a child's development to to three times more than any form of child care.\\" [Footnote on this quote from page 136 will take you to the study.] I wish this had been at the beginning of the book, because it gives moms permission to want to have a great career.<br /><br />But the second most important point, I thought, was \\"don't leave before you leave\\" (chapter 7). She points out that lots of women assume they'll have to do most of the childcare, or assume that they'll want to stay home, and therefore don't exhibit the same drive at work that most men do. As a result, many women find that their jobs are less challenging, their rewards less enticing, and their careers less satisfying, and so the decision to stay home or go back to work becomes unfairly weighted. If you have a great job that you love and are good at, which often go hand in hand, you are also more likely to receive the extra care from management that will make returning from maternity leave easier.<br /><br />We need to keep talking about these problems, because they won't go away by themselves. They need to be addressed by individuals and institutions, which are, after all, just the accumulation of many individuals' actions. The more women who move up the ranks in business and government, the closer we get to 50/50, the better off everyone will be.childcare, or assume that they'll want to stay home, and therefore don't exhibit the same drive at work that most men do.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Everything gets turned up side down. Caractors die and new ones get a main role. I have no clue who to trust
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Story line was okay. Amount of blood flying around looked fake and unrealistic. The story line could have used a better ending.
1572814748|5.0|Perfect small pocket deck. The printing is clear, the lines clean, with the coloring easy on the eyes, not the ghastly colors in the regular RWS deck that can make your eyes bleed. The box is thick and sturdy, though the lid slids off rather easily. If one puts it into the Black Hole of Death (your purse), you may want to wrap a band around it longways to make sure the lid does not slide off or put into a pocket of your purse to keep it all together.
B00CL0J99K|2.0|Ironman 2 was bad but Ironman 3 was 3 times worse than its predecessor. The third Ironman movie suffers some of the same problems as The Third Dark Knight movie did. Ironman 3 is too long. Ironman 3 has about 10 minutes of actual Ironman and 2 hours + of Tony Stark. Be warned. Also the villain was horrible. When a villain starts going south in the first 10 minutes of the movie, the movie has about a 85-90% failure probability.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|One thing that is great about this claymation is that there are no words.  So if you have to pull out the ipad at a restaurant (I know, I know) then this is a really good choice.
1452110581|5.0|My whole family has enjoyed this book, and my ten year old daughter has committed a couple of the poems to memory.  The small size of the book makes it easy to carry and I plan to give a copy as a stocking stuffer to my cat lover sister.  Anyone who has ever enjoyed living with a cat would find this book to be spot-on funny.
B00CHIMG6Y|1.0|Did not have a pleasant experience with this movie.  A third of the way in, the movie audio did not match with the scenes, the movie kept crashing and would freeze randomly therefore we were unable to finish this movie.  This is not the first time this has happened whilst renting from Amazon.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I love my Kindle, but I download the games for my grandchildren.  This game is fast, the graphics are stunning and it certainly kept my grandson engage through all the levels of this game.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|lots of fun, but can be very  expensive if you're impatient  with the long times to upgrade armor and remove adornments.
B0040I09RM|5.0|The whole Donna thing was cold.  I was hooked on Sons of Anarchy from the first episode.  The formula is different from any other serial drama and is totally engaging.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|After seeing this again so many years after it first came out, this time with my 9 year old son who is devouring the books, it is so much better with time.  Knowing the history of these characters, both on and off screen, the film that started it all (in visual form) is layered with meaning.  The film is true to the book in the smallest and most critical details.  A joy to watch and to share with your family.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|There are horrendous scenes in this movie but it's a good idea to be reminded of what happened on that tragic day. So many were helped by total strangers. The actors did a terrific job.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|Great sequel to the series.  The story and characters are a perfect fit to the book.  My children loved every moment of it, especially when Harry faced the basilisk. Doby is also a nice touch (and touching), even though he is cg and may harken back to the Jar Jar Binks flop of the Star Wars series, he will be a character that will be remembered and loved throughout time.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It's such a shame, I really love this game there are many options to play. But my main concern is it takes up a quarter of my memory on my kindle fire! I had to delete some other things. Other than that it's ls a great game. :)
B00271DNP4|5.0|The visuals and pacing in this Harry Potter are a bit different from the first two (different director), but it definitely fits the tone of this book.  The tale of Harry Potter starts to get deeper and richer by this book and this movie reflects that turn.  Can't wait for my son to finish book 4 so we can see the next movie!
B008I43DYU|4.0|Very easy to use. Glad I bought it. Comes in very handy and I have used it several times already.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The book was a very creative way to present slavery.  It was from the eyes of a white child who grows into womanhood living in the Kitchen House occupied by the slaves.  The ending was so quick I sort of wondered where the rest of the book went.
B001M1ETTO|5.0|Love this album - always have. While probably not their most famous record (perhaps that honor would go to &#34;In Visible Silence&#34;, featuring the Peter Gunn theme remake?), it was their first full length release. They built on an earlier EP release - that contained the track &#34;Beat Box&#34; (an early hip-hop hit) -  to create an eclectic sound based on noises, vocals and music samples often processed through the famous Fairlight CMI. While that description sounds like it could be a train-wreck in the making, what was actually produced was a creative and energetic record (with a few lighter, softer moments) that somehow takes a giant mix of sounds and noises and cohesively pulls them together. It's not a record for everyone, but for those who are interested in something a bit different, this record pays of quite nicely.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|I really like this show but the endings usually don't wrap up the events.  At first it was a little frustrating but after a few viewings became a comfortable way to end.  The viewer can pretty much fill in the ending with via the presentation of the show.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|Good Movie... 4 Different storylines that all end up with the same goal... New Years Eve. Love Jon Bon Jovi's contribution, but all the stories were really good, even Kutcher's was believeable, altho, no matter what film or TV show I see him play in, he's somehow always &#34;predictable&#34;... in other words, he doesn't have much range as an actor. This one is just mindless entertainment..nothing more than a feel good movie, but it's worth buying, especially when your spirit needs a &#34;pick me up&#34;.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have just finished reading this book, and just wiping away tears..what  an amazing<br />Story of human survival..my heart aches for this wonderful person and I pray that<br />The rest of his life is peaceful
B0000YEEGM|5.0|Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman.. Enough Said! This one is a classic and so good! It's such a touching story with lots of does of humor throughout.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Suspenseful, it kept me wanting to watch the next installment. I would recommend this for anyone liking suspense and good story line.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|The game was kinda stupid when I got to the higher levels of people when they have twenty magic cards and armor and some of the magic cards where retarded still kinda a good game
B00AIBZLVY|2.0|I have had some pretty cool dreams in my life, quite a few of them kinda scary in this indefinable \\"...ya' hadta be there...\\" way. I found a couple of the dreams I have had to be interesting and/or creepy enough to merit artistic attention. Perhaps a painting would suffice. Or a bit of graphic design. Maybe a short story or a short film. If I had the time, energy and interest, I could even turn some of these dreams into full-length films or a novel. Oh man, but that would call for a lot of work, or balls of steel, or--worse--both. I'd have to take this isolated concept, whose life began as a psychological and emotional island--removed, by definition, from anything resembling a coherent narrative--and place it within one that's tight enough, but odd enough, to do no insult to the small, original vision from which it sprang. I suspect that the construction of Andy Muschietti's MAMA rested on the same kind of compelling but flimsy foundation.<br /><br />It's my understanding that Muschietti made a short film about a woman who was chasing a couple of kids around a dilapidated house, the children all the while referring to this terrifying visage as \\"mama\\" while alternating between placating the woman and trying to escape from her. I guess the movie was pretty damned scary in an archetypal, hard to define way. It got the attention of Guillermo Del Toro, who thought there was enough raw horror in the short to develop it into a two-hour (give or take) movie.<br /><br />I can't disagree with Del Toro's assessment. I'm sure that what Muschietti made originally was very scary indeed. It sounds like it would make me crap my pants, and there are moments in MAMA that provide some real chills [the subtle effects used in making the girls appear completely wild, a few scenes where the children are playing with an implied--but obscured--MAMA]. But those occasions--like a cool, scary dream--stand completely apart from an otherwise tired plot line. You could isolate every genuinely alarming incident in MAMA, make a video with just those scenes, and end up with a far more disturbing film than what was released.<br /><br />The rest of MAMA (i.e. the boring parts) is nothing but a typical haunting story as generated by The Script-O-Matic 3000. A young woman (Chastain), compelling in that she's uninterested in having children with her husband/lover (Waldau), ends up forced by nasty circumstances into playing house with two of his nieces. The nieces are severely disturbed after having spent a few years living in the woods with the force/spirit known as MAMA. Bit by bit, the kids are socialized (one decidedly faster than the other) and the once-compelling young woman doing the lion's share of the rearing comes to feel an enduring and utterly dull love for them, and she's determined to protect both of the kids from the MAMA force that won't quite let them go. This is accomplished, of course, by gumshoeing her way through the mystery of why MAMA is such a pain in the butt. Once the mystery is solved--through means that are almost entirely daft--there is a final battle between the over-the-top, spirit MAMA and the now flat-as-wet-flint, suburban MAMA. The kid that's less socialized (and, frankly, more interesting) than her sister is sacrificed. Of course. The snore-inducing dinks that decide they don't want to be involved with anything more supernatural than the local Crate & Barrel survive. The end.<br /><br />It's a shame, really. I could see a lot of possibility during certain sequences of this film, and in certain characters. I wish Chastain--the human MAMA--could have stayed a strong and independent force, rather than knuckling under to the same worn-out Hollywood lecture about the joys of motherhood and servitude. I wish that the older child weren't so easily reigned in, so ready to wash off all of the hell that she'd endured because getting warm-fuzzies from Chastain just made all of her pain go poof! I wish that Waldau--Chastain's lover--would have had more screen time. God knows, he's charismatic and good looking enough to deserve it.<br /><br />MAMA could have been a force to reckon with, but Muschietti needs more confidence in his own vision. He needs to be able to let his dreams and ideas stand on their own, or he needs to take a page from Del Toro's playbook and let the dark side of the force have a win once in a while. Those kinds of stories are captivating. The ones where the good guys' prize for going through hell is a table at a local food court where they'll discuss Tiffany's soccer schedule, play dates, and honor roll standing while completely glossing over her hellish background just aren't.<br /><br />2.5 Starse had more screen time.

B00BWBHIUG|2.0|good game but i am completely annoyed by the pressure to use actual money because it is almost impossible to earn enough pearls. atleast allow to exchange some coins for pearls or a bit more realistic way of earning them
B00873GRU4|4.0|I really enjoyed the story line, although I wouldn't consider it Sci-fi - more an interesting take on the end of the world.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so awesome I can't even tell you. I just love it and I think it shows you that life is something uncontrollable but that we can choose how to welcome it. We can either spend it like van Houten or like Hazel and Augustus. Ans I choose H & G
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I should have listened to my kids!  (It's really going to have to be a product or media experience I hate or love to get me to review something for Amazon ever again.)

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really great show. Such great characters and the actors chosen for the parts are perfect. I can't wait to see the next season. I hope it's on TV for many, many more years!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|A great audio solution for any use. This is a great alternative to a high end  PCIe sound card. The build  quality is immaculate and the sound  quality is spectacular. I use in combination with Audioengine A5+ speakers. It's tread for getting clean 96/24 out of MacBook Pro. Amazing for only $79.

1451695195|4.0|I read this book in a matter of hours. I could not put it down. I mostly skipped the mundane sections regarding the doctors hospital stay and jumped to the more juicy subjects which explained his other wordly experiences. This book answered many of my questions regarding how the brain filters out certain things that are obvious to certain people like the saints but not obvious to other people. I really like the part that explains how God is human, that he has human emotions just like we do. This only confirms what I Personally experienced during my life time. Also the part about \\"cause and effect\\" which religious leaders and philosophers have been trying to explain to people for thousands of years. According to this book our planet Earth and maybe even our Universe, is on the lower rungs compared to other planets and universes since it is awashed in Evil. I' am not surprised at all since the Bible tells us that Satan and his angels were hurled down to earth. The author also states that there is evil in other universes but it is not as intense as it is here.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book had me hooked!! It was an amazing story that kept you wanting to turn the page. Amnesia is so hard to understand.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|These stories are wonderful...I can't get enough!  The story takes you into another time and place.<br />It really is a classic.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Eileen (age 9) really likes this game. She can also play with her friends. She likes it because she likes to take care of pets.
B0035RONVW|5.0|I had somewhat lost track of this band after second life syndrome. I've been listening to this and Shrine ever since I rediscovered the band. Just great work.

B00CI5ET7K|5.0|This is an amazing expression of the artist who continues to develop himself and his vision long into his career. He could have come out with just another album, but instead chose to challenge himself and press into what he is trying to express. Masterful!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|This is just like the computer version.  You do have to start at the beginning, but that is the fun of the game itself.

193700788X|4.0|After reading some explosive and almost hateful reviews about this book, I will say this: I am sure Ms. Harris is aware of the negative reactions to Dead Ever After. I would say she predicted it. At the beginning of this book, in the acknowledgements and dedications pages she references the fact that she knows she won't be making people happy with this book, and knows this isn't the first time.<br /><br />My opinion is that as soon as I read that Eric's maker had offered him in contract to the Queen of Oklahoma, (way back when) I was pretty sure he would never end up with Sookie. Eric was always a political player. Although he may not have made this contract himself, he could see the advantages especially after Sophie's death and Felipe's takeover. As Sookie had always suspected, he did not think Soookie would remain forever mortal. So how the book ended did not surprise me at all.<br /><br />I liked how Harris brought in all the major players for this last book, touching bases with each man and settling in her mind where they'd be in the future. My favorite was always Quinn, and I was glad to see them interact as good friends, all prior hurts forgotten. Her adventures in this book also tied up loose ends, with some interesting additions to the character list, and some surprises with old characters as well.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this series has been with Sookie herself. For me, she never grew up. It started in the last few books. She has seen and experienced so many things, met people in different worlds, finally traveled outside Bon Temps, had sex, discovered shocking facts about her family; I just thought Sookie would finally act like a womanly adult. At the end of the book I felt that Sookie was just stuck. The portrayal of Sookie as a moral but flawed girl/woman just doesn't work for me. She killed Debbie Pelt in self defense, but she orchestrated Victor's death and the death of others in that club that night with cold practicality. She has a big problem with the fact she can kill people and feel like a terrible Christian, but she's not sure vampires have souls, so maybe it doesn't matter?  She did not move forward, not because she couldn't, but because she chose not to, she just wouldn't. And poor Mr. Cataliades-she still holds a terrific grudge against him for the telepathy, and doesn't hesitate to, once again, let him know it. After all the ways he and Diantha have helped her, after losing his other niece helping Sookie, her animosity keeps showing, even as she asks for help again. I know she feels she suffered greatly, and perhaps unnecessarily, from having telepathy, but it's like she kept stamping her foot and saying, \\"I won't like it, I won't !\\" A spoiled brat that just won't let it go. Harris does a great job of portraying an adolescent/emerging young female here, not an experienced, and what should be, a worldly woman. One has the feeling of things being just swept under the rug, not to be thought of again. Something a girl would do; not the action of a woman with the experiences she has had. As I said, stuck. Maybe safe?<br /><br />But for me the book was a must-read. I had to read the last book in a wonderful series. I have waited for each book to come out and bought it immediately. Who will ever forget Sookie meeting Bill for the first time? The way she could see his skin shine? The way she couldn't hear his thoughts, how incredible it was to her and how very happy it made her? Thank you Charlaine Harris for such a memorable character. Thank you for so many wonderful stories about her, her world, and its inhabitants.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a creative puzzle game. I love the pudding monsters even though they don't look like pudding.  Would give it five stars if it weren't for the extremely annoying ads. Come on! Even those of us who grab all the free games don't deserve full page ads every few seconds.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Amazing novel, a masterpiece! One of Murakami's best, full of drama, fantasy and excitment. Once you start it's impossible to stop. Great!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Unexpected turns and twists in this book.  Considering our need for gladiator type events (roman times, MAN, etc) the hunger games seem plausible.<br /><br />Interesting how these books speak to a growing concern over government/politicians in general.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|As a fan of the Blackmore era Deep Purple I have bought every Album/CD they have made.  This latest iteration proves to be a new beginning.  Classy paying homage to the late Lord was thoughtful.<br /><br />The newest album gels with the new keyboardist who has appeared on over 200 albums.  I highly recommend this CD.<br /><br />Don't expect Highway Star or Lazy.  The music is excellent but will take a few spins to  catch on.
B00961ZGQC|5.0|I love this song....sing it over and over  and over. My grandkids join in, we love it and sing it alot.
B007N0REX6|5.0|Slash has done it again with Kennedy as his singer they make a great duo.  Tow of my all time favorite songs were on his last CD and this CD is a real winner.  Thank you Slash et al.
B00BPA2PGG|2.0|I couldn't get beyond the constant camera movement to even get into the movie. In fact it made me sick to watch. Only one other movie did this back when, same theme. Others watching agreed. (No it's not 4k sickness)
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I really like Death Magnetic, its bring you back to their first five albums. Heavy riffs, thrashy and fast. Back to more complex drumming, guitar playing which Metallica is know for and the best at. I know the mixing on this album isn't the greatest but its very similar to the production of ...And Justice for All. I really like all the tracks except the Unforgiven III. The Judas Kiss is really awesome as well as All Nightmare Long and My Apocalypse. Their best album since the Black Album in my opinion, very highly recommended. A must have!
0783225849|4.0|Hard to beat the classics and this is one of the best. Hitch does an awesome job of delving deep into our minds and stirring up thought and emotions from there.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|But fantastic finale to a phenomenal series.. well done Ms.  Collins, you've outdone your self.  Thanks for a great read!
B0049J3QF4|5.0|Very good graphic, excelent story, kids love the movie, adult love the movie! No bed language! What else you can ask?

B0000714BP|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time!  Patrick is a hit and this will be rewatched for many years!
1593272200|5.0|It's hard to say what hasn't already been said about this book, but to put my two cents in... The key strengths of this book are its thoroughness, organization, and exposition. It's a massive tome and for a good reason - the breadth and depth of its coverage.  The topics are well-organized and logically broken down into small easily digestible chapters. The writing is very clear, filled with context and plethora of examples.
1451695195|1.0|I found Dr. Alexander's account of what he termed \\"heaven\\" and his experience of being in the afterlife very disturbing and dark. At times it seemed more like an account of something closer to what Hell might be like.  Reference his chapter \\"Underworld\\".  One statement that he made (amongst many) that \\"you can do no wrong\\" and possibly causing all to believe they're going to go to heaven is exactly what people want to hear these days. There are too many things in his account of \\"heaven\\" that are incompatible with scripture.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander may have had some kind of an NDE, but the involvement of Susan Reintjes (an intuitive) using \\"channeling\\" or telepathic communication (are forms of spiritism and paranormal techniques) which are not Christianity in any form, and is strictly forbidden by scripture under the category of \\"mediums\\".  We aren't to allow others to go into the \\"back door\\" of our consciousness and \\"work\\" there. God (Jesus Christ) wants for others...\\"that none should perish\\". Scripture says, \\"all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.\\" We need a Saviour and He is Christ the Lord, not Om (the term Dr. Alexander uses when referring to God) because that was the sound he remembered hearing \\"associated with that omniscient, omnipotent, and unconditionally loving God, but any descriptive word falls short\\". And he refers to \\"the Orb\\" as his companion while in heaven.  Om is a term/chant used in Yoga and relates to Brahman in Hinduism having absolutely nothing to do with the God of the universe, Jesus Christ.  Additionally, he referred to himself as being in the \\"Realm of the Earthworm's-Eyeview.\\"  He claims that during his time in heaven he had no memory of anyone or anything in his life.  This is counter to scripture where the Apostle Paul tells us \\"when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away\\" and \\"now we see in a mirror dimly, but then (when in heaven) face to face.  Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully even as I have been fully understood.\\"  1 Corin 13: 10, 12.  And that when we are in heaven \\"we shall be like him\\" (Jesus). 1 John 3:2.<br /><br />Satan is alive and well on the planet earth. He's called \\"the great deceiver\\" an \\"angel of light,\\" \\"the shining one\\" for a reason. He can mimic the work of God, but mixes truth with error and light with darkness (and such is the case in Dr. Alexander's book. The end result is never good. The Lord has warned that in these Last of The Last Days before Christ returns that we will see many phenomena--people will be healed, raised from the dead, etc. There will be miracles and signs and wonders on the earth and in the sky, but one must have a good grasp of scripture to discern whether these things be of God or satan. The Lord won't deceive you, but satan will be glad to.<br /><br />What I didn't see, and don't see in Dr. Alexander's book is a new-found or renewed sense of his love for Jesus or a concern for the \\"lost\\". I've had the privilege of being with a number of dying people and through them seen clear glimpses of heaven before they entered, and nothing of Dr. Alexander's account reflect any similarities. The title of Dr. Alexander's book is a misnomer: you won't find proof of heaven in that read.  If you'd like a really good read; a truly accurate; scripturally-sound account of heaven; then by all means read, \\"Heaven is For Real\\" authored by Todd Burpo. Let's not let satan have the victory here. \\"Know the truth and the truth will set you free\\" and by all means ask God (the one true and only wise God) for wisdom and discernment.

B00C7L8DM2|4.0|Good movie overall with good fight and tech scenes. I didn't think that the sound track was overwhelming like another user said.
B004GYY714|1.0|Same old, same old.. aps are written for urban areas. If you live in a rural area don't bother with this ap.All you will get is \\"failure to find stream\\".  'Nough said.
B007SRZULW|5.0|I have the video of Pride and Prejudice, after viewing it several times I was interested in the meanings of many of the words and the sentence structure.  The book gave all the definitions and explained the sentence structure of that era.  I would certainly recommend the book to any fan of Jane Austen especially someone interested in a better understanding the true English language.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addicting. Adults and kids find can find endless hours of enjoyment. I love this app and have referred it my friends and family.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Very good for a free game.  The game is well played out and great graphics.  I would recommend this game for those looking for a game to kill some time.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Starts slow. More like SimCity with battles. Becomes addicting. Worth the money. Has good battles with online players. This game was worth the review.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is so well done and put together... I it several times because there is so much good information and was shocked to find out were our food comes from and how it's processed... It really changed the way I eat and think about the food indurtry and all the politics behind it... I can't belive human kind could go to such a lengh just to profit from all of us .... Highly recommend for those who care about you food, animas and the environment...This is an eye opener and it should be showed in school as a riquirement for environmenta sinece, politics and economics ....
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I read it through cover to cover as fast as I could<br />Truly an epic I can't wait to read the next installment
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun and I LOVE the real life graphics. Best game ever yay
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is a talented writer, and her book is a joy to read from beginning to end.  It's really more about Cheryl's inner struggles and her personal journey from &#34;lost to found&#34; than simply about her arduous hike on the Pacific Crest Trail.  Definitely not a &#34;hiker's how-to guide,&#34; although a hiker could learn quite a bit from Cheryl's difficulties on the trail.  I definitely recommend Wild as an enjoyable read that not only entertains, but also gives the reader lots to think about.
B009VA1FN6|2.0|I looked forward this, thinking it would be something like Kate Atkinson would write. How wrong I was. I could not get connected to the characters, try as I might. And there were just too many words, flowing out one after the other, to little purpose.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book has served its purpose, to open the eyes of an American and evoke compassion toward North Korean refugees. To be honest, when North Korea is in the news, I didn't pay that much attention. I turned a deaf ear to it, I didn't understand it. But reading about Shin and Camp 14 puts a face and a boy's life in my mind, and puts faces on all of the other innocent people living within the camps in North Korea.<br />I'm almost finished with the book. I bought it last night and spent my Saturday reading it. I hope and pray that Shin can live a healthy life and realize that none of what happened was his fault and he did nothing wrong. He did what he had to do to survive and God understands that.<br />Thank you, Shin, for telling your story and thank you, Blaine, for writing it.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|The steering controls seem too hard to master.  I don't feel like trying too hard to get it right since it seems very boring
B00CRW2066|5.0|Still getting to know it, but after 4 or 5 times through I think it is as good as you would expect...
B0097K21YW|5.0|Lots of clever situations to figure out how to proceed.  Many levels of free play make this a worthwhile download
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not just a story of an aristocratic family and their servants, but a captivating look at English country life. Series 2 (Season 2 as we say in the US) begins as WWI impacts Downton Abbey upstairs and down, and while some soap opera aspects creep in, you can't help but get caught up in the story as it unfolds. Superb writing and lush settings combine with right-paced storytelling keeps you coming back for more.
0425252868|5.0|This is just an excellent book.  The purpose of the book is to tell the story of this one particular instance during the war, but the author tells the story on a German Ace throughout the war from start to finish, including this one special day.  Then. He ends with the story of how this German Ace and the pilot of the US bomb reconnected after 40-some years.  Really the bulk of the book was not about the one day they met in the skies over Germany, and I think that made for an even more interesting story than I was expecting.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00136Q2C0|5.0|It's hard to believe there's currently only 5 reviews for this album. We're all aware of the circumstances surrounding this recording. So the question is: Is it any good and does is still hold up? To the former, I say it's not only good but it stands right up there with his best albums. To the latter, I give a resounding yes.<br /><br />The insular nature of this recording was like a brilliant disguise; off-putting for a lot of fans and critics. But when you listen closely, the music speaks of universal/scary truths that all of us can identify with. That's what makes Bruce so singular. And although his singing is only the equal of his talents as a lyricist and performer, somehow he overcomes this with some of the best vocals of his career (See the ending of One Step Up for proof). Of course it also helps that the great Clearmountain sympathetically produced the album.<br /><br />And memo to \\"a customer\\" review: I don't know what you're smoking but Bruce & Seger are not only rockers but among the all-time great rockers!
B00B2DSK06|2.0|had trouble watching this movie. It keep booting me out and saying error with selection made try again later it was not the only movie that kept doing this
B00136JUTM|4.0|The Boss takes a big chance and succeeds. Foregoing one of the greatest back-up bands ever to go solo and still make a rock record. A couple of tracks, like Real Man & the Long Goodbye have that generic rock sound and come awfully close to filler. But this cd also has some of the strongest lyrics, vocals, and guitar playing he's ever done. For proof, you have to look no further than my favorite track, \\"Real World.\\" The rest of songs follow suit.<br /><br />Supposedly Bruce and many of his fans have disowned this cd claiming it was just too \\"happy\\". However, the last time I checked, no one complained about the \\"happy\\" songs on Born to Run or Born in the USA or the River for that matter. And 57 Channels, Cross My Heart, Gloria's Eyes, & especially I Wish I Were Blind are hardly happy songs. I think it's the very modern and up-to-date production on the cd as well as the fact that his buddies, the E-Street Band, are not backing him up that really threw fans & critics for a loop.<br /><br />By the way, major props for the contributions of the last great living soul singer, Sam Moore. AMEN!
B00BHUB11Y|2.0|had the wii in my house and the movie kept saying error, moved the wii to my mom's house and it played for a while then again the movie would turn off and the screen says error selection cannot be played at this time
B001QD7SF0|5.0|If you listen with headphones, it becomes immediately clear what everyone else has been complaining about; that Brendan Obrien botched the production on this CD. For proof, all you have to do is compare the songs on this cd with the ones on the Magic & Devils cd's. There is a clarity, sharpness, and immediacy of sound on those cd's that WOAD is sorely lacking. It almost sounds like he was going for some sort of Phil Spector meets Brian Wilson wall of sound in fake stereo. And yet, and this is crucial, the music's power and grace somehow penetrates this pollution of a mix in glorious fashion. To me this is a testimony to the greatness of Bruce. He's like a great method actor who works through the accumulation of gesture and detail. He does this while covering the entire pop spectrum and in the end nothing could get in the way of his dream. Not even bad production.<br /><br />Tell me can you ask for anything more?
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Interesting, funny and touches on so many aspects of modern history.<br />Easy and enjoyable reading. Difficult to stop reading rather than keep on until finished.
140123755X|5.0|I was in a comic book shop picking up some books for my husband when I noticed the title. After reading the synopsis on the back;I decided to give it a try. Growing up I'd read fairy tales and always wondered what happened to them. Reading this was a delightful twist on old stories. I enjoyed this and would recommend this to any comic book readers who enjoy well written,easy to love/hate characters.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I received this collection as a Christmas gift.  It is the complete series...can't get enough of the antics of Carrie!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Probably one of the best albums I've bought in the past few years.  It's one of those (just like Vampire weekend and Contra) that you can literally load into your deck and let it play through.  Not a huge fan of 'Ya Hey', but it might just be growing on me.  Five Star Album.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Good price and hey.....who doesn't love Harrison Ford, i know that i do!  Good addition to my Indiana Jones Collection.

B001NLL93W|5.0|I'm hooked on Showhunters!<br />If you liked books one and two, you'll like  book three too!<br />Cassandra Clare has a way of bringing you onto the Shadowhunter world, I have to get the next book right away.<br />Great!
B009MYARIK|4.0|a light, fun read with more of Kinsella's keen observation about young women and what they value and how to inject common sense in selecting an appropriate mate:  look for someone who will value what is important to you, not just someone who is good in bed.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Referred by my son. I was totally engrossed until I finished. I would definitively buy this one again. Good stuff.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I love this author's ability to deliver to young people on two levels: reach them at their level, and paint a picture of what could happen if you continue on a course that may sound appealing but is not practical.  Without preaching, Kinsella lets young women know what qualities are important in a mate and by the end of the book, that's exactly what the reader wants as well.  She is a brilliant author.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|Good read - recommend to other book clubs.  Will watch out for others by this author. Also enjoyed the Nicci Frenc (Freda Klein series)
B00C7L8DM2|1.0|There are more CIA-paid professional killers in the movies than normal employees in the real agency. I am 66 y.o. now and I have been watching this sort of movies since I was 10. I feel it is time to stop.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Great movie. The ending was quite unexpected. I wonder why Gandalf never uses eagles for these quests. It would be so much easier.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I was not really s big fan of Daft Punk. I knew a couple of their songs, at least their most famous ones, and tracks off of Discovery, which I could not help hearing as my sister would always be listening to it. so when she first made me watch The Collaborators videos, I was interested in the concept that the group was going for with this album. Upon hearing Get Lucky, I was hyped. Niles Rodgers on guitar, and some nice soulful-ish vocals from Pharrel? Nice stuff. So when the album first came out, I took a listen to it, and I have to say, it's some pretty quality music. Before listening to this album, I took a quick listen to their other albums (mostly Discovery and Human After All) and I noticed that the latter had this very loud and unpleasant production, but this is not an issue with R.A.M.<br /><br />Most people who did not like this album are people who've discovered Punk in the days of Homework and Discovery, and were expecting a full of house music. I guess they did not understand that Daft Punk was going for a more traditional experience here, but at the same time reinventing this genre with effective synths and songwriting. It's combining two different genres together (Disco and Electronic) while Disco is more prominent here instead of the other way around.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this album.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game never disappoints me at all. It's fun, addictive, and has the best price for this amazing game. Must buy game!!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|Wonderful love story. I loved the space scenes and the Ice Giants. I find myself watching a lot more than I thought I would. Didn't expect an adult coming of age movie...not bad.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I'm really happy with this FAOTD - my little guy loves playing it.  And to those that say there is no way to exit the game, look for the little X in the upper right corner of the menu screen. ;)
B004QYTRRS|5.0|Great movie. I love Johnny Depp movies and he is stellar working with his wife. The scenery in the movie is great too!
B000JO9JHW|3.0|Leave it to Showtime to have unnecessary foul language. I'm definitely intrigued by the plot but absolutely detest &#34;effing this&#34; and &#34;effing that&#34; in the story line; it adds NOTHING to the script and, in fact, I think takes away from a great series. I've only watched the pilot episode and though I'd like to see all the others I probably won't.:(
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Better than the first two! A must read for everyone...this one is a true winner...don't miss out on an awesome experience!
B00CS65JS2|1.0|This whole album feels like a bunch of leftover tracks, a lot of hype for a lot of disappointment. Buy the single not the album.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is really fun. I definitely recommend it. I play it really often. Very addicting game. Best of all, its FREE! Definitely a game worth getting
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|My husband loved this CD in his Easter basket! It made him reminisce, and realize just how talented Jimi really was..... He also loved the guest artists' performances....
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A good visual exercise, never was good at this type of puzzle, but I am getting better.<br />Can be addictive.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I keep going back to tracks 2 thru 7 on this disc in my car on the way to work, because they're so GOOD.... Michael Buble has such a 'now' sound on this one.... The older standard's don't disappoint either.. (Just not my thing...) The duet with Reese Witherspoon was an early favorite, and brought back memories of the original, on the radio when I was a kid....
B006885FZI|4.0|Not as good as Band of Brothers, yet still very good. Supurb acting, incredible action and historically on point. Excellent series.
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|After seeing so much of JT on TV with this album, I was anxious to get it.... Only 2 tracks are worth listening to... Basically, the rest of it is a reeeeaaaaallllly loooooong rap song w/big band backup, and a base singer getting paid waaaaay to much for his effort...
B00BLCHL4Y|2.0|It's as though a high school drama club was given a huge budget and wrote, directed and acted in this thing. The lead character is horrible.I guess his blue eyes got him the job. The mixture of accents, British to, I guess, Scandinavian is laughable. The action scenes are OK, but the great scenery, props, and costumes are wasted on this, mostly, mindless dribble.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy this game! Many designs and challenges to keep you playing for hours. From small sets to large complicated ones, hours of fun for everyone
B005D63ICI|3.0|I found the early Dexter seasons fascinating,compelling, and pretty scary. I think the serial killer/superman genre has run its course, and though Michael Hall is a terrific actor, it's becoming less and less believable that he can keep his secret life from spilling out into his public life and work.
0062064304|5.0|The sheer attention to detail in this book is astonishing.<br />From the beautiful graphic design elements on every page to showing the evolution and progression of wetas masterful concepts.<br />I cant recommend this enough for any artists.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Sad, emotional, heart wrenching, loving. This book hits a huge soft spot! Each turn of the page had me wanting to read more. In love!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|The premise is simple but its fun to earn the collections. Very absorbing game. I just hope in the end we meet Mr X
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Aleluia! No cheap imitation of Twilight/Fifty Shades! Matthew Quich show us that there is light at the end of the tunnel of criativity!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|It's like Cut The Rope, but easier. Fun, addictive, &amp; cute.  You have to put the pudding together. You should get it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|My six year old gives it two thumbs up.<br />Great for kids. He is always telling me his strategies against the bogmen.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hill climb racing is the funniest game in the world but it is kinda challenging I hope u enjoy this game because I did
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I love movies when there's a war going on between humans and aliens. I would recommend this to my cousin.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I think this is a very nice leather case. I like the close to sleep and that it is rotatable. Only problem I have with it is that with the the zag screen protector I use on my kindle fire the hand grip leaves two smudge marks on my screen when I close it. I would remove the screen protector but I am worried that it will leave the same marks on my actual screen. Other than that I love it!
B003B02PF4|5.0|This was yet another great book by John Grisham.  The Broker keeps you in suspense.  I especially liked the detailed descriptions of Bologna, Italy and the culture.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and figured that I needed to read the book as well. There are a few things that are different, but I enjoyed the book version even more. I finished the book in just a few days, mostly attributed to the fact of wanting to compare the book and movie version. Both were great in their own right!
B00CL6HGIK|5.0|A really fine job on the part of all actors involved - engaging and intriguing, worth the rental fee.  No gratuitous violence or sex, either, so it was genuinely enjoyable to watch.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Perfect game to pass the time with. Makes you want to keep playing. I look forward to seeing the next round of games.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this show! This was one purchase I would make again and again! I received the product the first day it was expected and have absolutely zero complaints :)
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|Excellent depiction of human nature at its worst and finest.  Genuine characters and superb actors create a dark, trepid intrigue.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This was film was simply brilliant. So hope they do a sequel. Awesome story line, strong characters and great acting. Would recommend to anyone.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Enjoyed reading it. Folliet maintains interest thruout Sometimes he drags out the narrative Overall would recommend it will look forward to rest trilogy
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|Khaled simply tells the wonderfully heartfelt stories of these characters. It draws you in and grips you till the end.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|author`s formula continues to work Still mfeel his first novel was best.author maintained my interest thruout looking forward to future novels
B00009R86L|4.0|I got two of these for my 4 gallon back pack sprayer which weighs about 35 pounds when full.  The Domke pads make the spraying life more bearable but I wonder if gel strap pads as used by rock musicians might work even better.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Keeps me up at night Enjoy Follett `s writing and development of plot Look forward to rest of series excellent
B005XBKXV2|1.0|AMAZON's playback is substandard and is a waste of time and money. I bought the digital edition for my son who can not enjoy to the movie all the way through because of poor playback. You might as well purchase the DVD with digital copy you'll come out a lot better in terms of reliability. I thought it was just my computer but HULU CRACKLE, YOUTUBE, and MAJOR networks play just fine it leads me to think that Amazon is loosing quality. Like McDonalds without the fries is a wasted trip, so is Amazon without reliability. I have already unsubscribed from PRIME and may stop using Amazon all together. I can definitely find discounts elsewhere.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I enjoy Jane Austen novels. Emma is an great story and the actors chosen in this production were excellent. I will watch again!
0307279189|5.0|I am from Mexico, and to me....know more about my culture is definitely amazing....THANKS for writing this book....Born to Run. is one of my favorite book,. love it! :-) :-) :-) :-)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Downton Abbey, but was disappointed with Matthew's demise. I understand that he wanted to move on to other work, but do wish that he would be back...after all the end shows him severely injured but that is where it ends. Miracles do happen and he could recover!
B002I9Z8CG|4.0|If Star Trek III: The Search for Spock restored the cast of our beloved Enterprise, it was the fourth film's task to bring them home and offer respite from the turmoil of the two previous entries in the franchise. And on that score, returning director Leonard Nimoy and a quartet of screenwriters (including Wrath of Khan wunderkind Nicholas Meyer) largely succeed in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, ultimately the most financially successful of the original series of films.<br /><br />On paper, the story sounds almost unbelievably stupid: the Enterprise crew travels back in time to 1986 to rescue humpback whales and save the future from a destructive probe. Yet, after its somber predecessor, The Voyage Home works as a refreshing change of pace for the films in that it is almost purely a fish-out-of-water comedy. It mines for humor by affirming just how different the world of Trek is from contemporary reality, but because these juxtapositions remain true to the characters the audience has grown to love over the years, the film works. In terms of artistry and ambition this is a bit of a downward step from the series' heights, and the film shows its age perhaps more readily than others due to its real-world setting, but it overall remains a consistent, entertaining, and fun effort.<br /><br />Paramount's Blu-ray is... adequate. Like Search for Spock (and, indeed, the latter two films in the original six), the image shows more detail than previous home releases but suffers quite noticeably from digital manipulation and scrubbing. Audio fares better, with the sounds of the probe having good presence (as does Leonard Rosenman's somewhat-grating musical score).<br /><br />Extras largely replicate the two-disc DVD special edition, including an amusing commentary featuring both Nimoy and William Shatner and a nice tribute to actor Mark Lenard, who played Spock's father Sarek through the original incarnation of the franchise. New extras include a commentary featuring the writersof the new J.J Abrams Star Trek films, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and featurettes exploring how the film raised social awareness of whaling and on how Treks 2, 3, and 4 form a narrative \\"trilogy.\\"<br /><br />Not the pinnacle of the franchise, in my view, but funny and enjoyably different from the other Star Trek films, especially if viewed in chronological order. Recommended.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My husband and I both have enjoyed Downton Abbey. We own all three seasons, but have even watched it on the computer! The actors are superb. Maggie Smith is our all time favorite.
B003LSU0K8|5.0|Bought for my boy friend, He is a merchant Marine sailor and loves this watch come in handy out there on the ship
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Reading this book changes things. The way you see. The way you think. The way you act. The innocence of Charlie makes you want to change your life.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|it wont play sometimes and took my skills away it is a good game but if you cant play it how good is it
B00003CXD0|5.0|great movies for a husband and wife to see,we loved it.....order it and you will see what i mean, and it comes faster than you think.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|I like Star Trek. This movie has its corny parts but it's still entertaining. Not all of the Star Trek movies were good. This one highlights our time which is fun to see.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app has a lot of features. I got it for free so I can't complain about the price. I was really only looking a notepad to keep track of what I need for my garden on my phone. This has a lot of features I don't think I'll ever need. For instance my notes are synched with Google. I don't know how I'll ever use that. Really doesn't benefit me, so I have to assume it benefit someone else, which is why I didn't give 5 stars. Still waiting to see if my email gets spammed to hell by gardening companies.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great music and fun storyline. A bit of foul language though. Some very funny lines also. Wish there were more fun musical movies like this.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I Love This Game!!! :) I am So Addicted!! I play this game for hrs. I hate if I don't score at least 2 stars on every Level. Even tho I prefer to get 3 stars ;)
0810994739|5.0|My grandson loves this series.  He's nine and reads at a 12+th grade level, and so he can zip through these, but still likes the stories.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's a fairly quick read, but brings light to mental illness - something our culture still sees as taboo. The storyline differs noticeably between the book and the movie, but I personally found the book to be much more enjoyable.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books were entertaining and kept my interest through the whole book.  I really enjoyed this one the most of all of them.
0307987698|2.0|I remember this book as a kid and I still like it now. The version is really cheaply made and I don't like it. The pages stick out farther then the book cover does. I have never seen a book like this. I will add a picture to show what I mean.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Loved the book so much that I went out and bought his &#34;increase your financial IQ&#34; right before I finished this one. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
0307010856|2.0|I remember this book as a kid and I still like it now. The version is really cheaply made and I don't like it. The pages stick out farther then the book cover does. I have never seen a book like this. It also looks like the made the book smaller but the pictures are still a little too big so some of the original picture gets cut off from the page. I will add pictures to show what I mean. i also bought the other book Another Monster At The End Of This Book and the pages stick out farther as well. I am going to send them back and look for a better copy.
B00005NKK8|4.0|for my man. He loves the movie and CD came with it. I think :)... Few songs were fun to listen to, even if I am not from that generation. One can always appreciate good things in life, no matter age or in this case, taste.
B0068PHS5Q|3.0|i am still only halfway, but have been a bit annoyed by apparent inconsistencies. eg from the view of a child how can she know the thoughts and motives of adults around her. i guess she is imagining them as the adult author that she is later<br />maybe this will be revealed by a twist in the tale. i'm persevering for the moment, but not even sure if I will continue reading it to the end
B0091VOCAS|5.0|I've seen this one hundred times, and I love it over, and over again.<br />Never met a girl that didn't love this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it! I even read dark places and sharp objects and enjoyed them both! I would totally read it again!
1603420398|5.0|Wonderful motifs, easy instructions, and the extras in the book made my day!  Thank you for a wonderful and easy transaction!
B0012HF5NC|4.0|Always a great movie to watch over and over. Very well done characters are the type you cheer for. Good movie
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I have no use for this, have plenty of people to talk to.  Had it removed, I think, so hopefully I don't see on my kindle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Timeless and classic. It is very entertaining.  It has great options  for scoring ,card styles and backgrounds. You'll love it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|In fact, I tried to delete this from my Kindle but could not.  Please take it off.  Also the other one Twitter, do not use and prefer not to have on my kindle fire
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|I like a wide variety of video games, so I'll try almost anything. I think this game does a good job at what it's trying to accomplish, but it wasn't what I was hoping for. I like match 3 games, but I prefer the ones that play like Puzzle Quest (where you switch gems that are next to each other). This is one of those games where you slide the whole row to match gems (or tiles or whatever), kind of like Chuzzle. I also prefer puzzle games that don't require quick thinking to beat a level. I don't mind if you get more points for being quick, but I prefer it not be necessary to progress. In this game you really need to be quick thinking.<br /><br />So, if those things sound good to you, then this game does those things very well. For me, it gets 3 stars (It's okay).
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|this book is about young people living with cancer and it's effects on their families and their young lives.  it's a good book that reads like a rollercoaster ride of emotions- happy, sad, funny- it's got it all!  can't wait to check out some of this authors other youth-inspired yet less depressing books.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Never thought they would actually do a live version but they have been and I'm impressed......the bad part is they could go on and on since CGI is so rampant now.......I'm looking forward to seeing all the characters like the cartoon days!
B003XU3MWM|3.0|this movie was alright; the plot was kind of vague, though.  I was expecting a major Roman war epic but it wasn't.  sure, there was some good battle scenes but most of the story revolves around Roman soilders being hunted down by enemy man-trackers and their struggle for survival, not only from the enemy but from their own roman allies as well.  An alirght movie, just not the epic i was expecting!
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I enjoyed reading this novel.  I found it well written and liked the story within a story format. This was the first book I've read by this author.  I plan to check for her other works.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I am really enjoying this series and plan to read the rest. This author has an incredible imagination. Two comments: One.. the love making scenes start to get redundant and second  there is very little about the change of living style. Claire seems to &#34;just&#34; adapt.<br />After 20 years in  comfort, she is now sleeping on ground, dirt, eating God awful food , not bathing for weeks, living with all kinds of insects, she seems to just fit right in.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I thought this was the best of all 3 movies, bringing it to a semi-closure. I have loved the character of Iroman since I first would read about him in marvel comics as a kid and RD jr really brings Ironman to life and gives him m more depth on character. He even is on the mark as the funny, intelligent and rich character of Tony Stark as Stan Lee had him. in the comics and each show got better. I give this one a five out off five stars.<br />8th avenger
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Some friends really liked it but I was really put off by the part of the book I read. It's one of the few books I haven't finished. I want my money back
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit was a fascinating read for me. I found it well written, well organized and took away tidbits that will help me in my personal life as well as in running my business.<br />  I will not summarize the book here in detail as that has been done by other reviewers.  Duhigg lays out a fascinating theory of how habits control our lives and backs it up with extremely relevant examples in individuals, businesses, and societal realms.  He also raises some interesting ethical questions concerning personal responsibility.<br />  This would have been a fascinating book if one were only reading the examples of how habits work in marketing, in 12 step programs, and in corporate and social organizations.  However its value as a self help book is tremendous.  It has empowered me to look at many details of my life with new scrutiny as I see how many of my actions are not conscious decisions but merely the result of mindless ritual.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Simply yet elegantly put. Have you shipped today? This is not self help, rather self doing;and not just for work, yet life as well.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Horrible movie! Maybe a few laughs but all in all terrible! Turned it off half way through movie. Good thing it was a prime movie and i didnt pay for it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is totally worth the $7.00! Minecraft is a very addicting game it will keep you busy. THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!! (It works well with kindle fire HD)
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Better for kifds 8 and up my 8 yr old had fun for a few but my younger child notso much is a slow going game
B008XG1X18|5.0|Really enjoy Pinterest!  I work with adults with special needs so always looking for craft ideas and recipes for them to try. Pinterest any more is my first stop when seeking new ideas.<br /><br />I also use many of the ideas at home to!  Its like window shopping. Fun!  I love seeing others creative ideas and enjoy sharing my finds too.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I started the game thinking it would be no different than other hundred games like it. However, G5 came through again, the game was amazing. The graphics were good and the story line kept you guessing till the end.
0345803493|5.0|I read book one and had to have 2 and 3 to see what happens. I find the whole book intriguing, Good storyline and was curious (not interested in trying it) about the sex style.<br />I found Christian to be very sensual, sweet, charismatic, sexy etc. what's not to love about him.<br /><br />Definitely a chick book.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|In my opinion, the preview made the movie out to be some kind of intense legal thriller. While the story was based around the plane crash and the impending trial, I felt that it primarily focused on the addictive/alcohol driven lifestyle of (Washington). I thought that this made the movie long and drawn out. I was constantly waiting for more 'plot' to develop, but it just kept circling back to the same struggle with alcohol and drugs. Further, I thought many of the scenes were distasteful and crude.<br />The movie has a nice ending, and sort of leaves you off with a feeling of accomplishment and true progress and rehabilitation.<br />However, I'll admit that I have no interest in seeing the movie again. And, if I would have known about the overwhelming emphasis put on the alcoholism, I probably would have avoided it altogether.<br />In general, I like Denzel as an actor. Many of his movies I enjoy watching again and again. This one, will not be on that list.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is very addicting I LOVE IT and so does my Daughter lol. She loves to play with the new fish and i love the whole thing lol
B00BMYHU7Y|2.0|Since they cost more than twice as much as other Amazon box set offerings that were clearly marked as &#34;mass market&#34; (I.E. the small paperbacks), I assumed this was the larger sized (trade) paperbacks.  My mistake!!  What I got was small &#34;mass market&#34; for twice as much as I would have paid if that was what I wanted.<br /><br />I sent them back and bought all four books at the larger (trade) paperback size at Costco for less than I paid for these.<br /><br />Needless to say I will not buy any more books from &#34;chem-physics-law-books&#34;.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|The main point for me is that allows markings on documents. This allows to see the documents as you review them on the desktop computer.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was a very enjoyable away to pass the time. Enjoyed both the story and the puzzles. Will play other games by G5
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a successful revival of the classic BBC show. I just wish the actor playing this doctor (Christopher Eccleston) did more than one season.
0679805273|5.0|Bought 2 for my children! I am saving them as a surprise for their high school graduations. I hope they will be as excited as I am.
0399159347|5.0|I became a big fan of Liane Moriarty's novels after reading \\"The Hypnotist's Love Story\\"; she writes compellingly and realistically of modern marriage, betrayal, joy and heartbreak. So I was thrilled to have the opportunity to review her latest, \\"The Husband's Secret\\", which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />There are three main characters, Cecilia, Rachel and Tess, who are all experiencing upheavals in their lives. Moriarty excels at describing how the quotidian details of one's life can change due to the \\"before and after\\" of cataclysmic events. She deftly uses both Tupperware and the Berlin Wall as metaphors for sealing in and keeping out.<br /><br />The novel is about secrets, and I don't want to reveal any of them because Moriarty does it so brilliantly in the novel. Basically we are asked, as observers, to contemplate how a person can live with a huge and terrible, secret. And how can you live knowing someone else's huge and terrible secret? Human existence is complicated and messy and far from black and white/good and bad. Humans make strange and often irrational choices. Are they always indefensible? These are the kinds of things that Moriarty is so good at dissecting for her readers, and why we keep coming back for more.<br /><br />Without revealing anything, I want to say a word about the ending. I expect some readers are going to have a problem with the climax and the denouement.  I thought about it for a while after finishing the book and before sitting down to write this review, and I decided that I'm fine with it. I think Moriarty made the right writing and plot choices here and it worked for me. I highly recommend this novel.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Ok so this game is free I am ok with that but, there needs to be an update in this game. Sure it's fun an all but update the cussing thing! Please! And also u should really change the music it really sucks bad. Please give feedback to this review thank you.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|Clearly, if you are purchasing this item, you have watched or know someone who has watched the other seasons.  Hate to see this series end but it is one of my favorites.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Never know when you will come across a treasure of a book, lots of great characters and a whole new world to discover, off to start the next one!
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is one of the great storytellers of our generation. I eagerly anticipated the release of his third novel, \\"And the Mountains Echoed,\\" and it lived up to my exceedingly high expectations. This novel begins with a father telling a bedtime story to his two children, which ultimately sets the stage for the fate of the young daughter, Pari. Her story, or at least part of it, is the first one  recounted in this incredible collection of stories about the lives of many intertwined characters, stretching all the way around the world and spanning multiple generations. This is a story about family, both blood and otherwise, and the ties that bind people together forever regardless of circumstances. If you're like me, you won't be able to put this book down because of its beautiful writing and the deep emotional responses it elicits from readers. It was well worth the seven-year wait. If you only read one book this summer, this should be it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book gives me meanings I did not now about I love this book so much it is better than my teacher
B008PUF3VS|5.0|Interesting but very sad story. Brings out the hate that took place during that time.  There were some very brutally hateful people then.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Best game ever ......this game is incredibly fun . It runs perfectly great with the kindle fire hd  I'm enjoying this game so much
B00AEFYCL4|4.0|A movie hasn't made me cry like this since A Beautiful Mind.<br />But unlike that movie which I love to this day....this movie leaves me feeling torn between sympathy, hatred and a slew of other emotions I won't go into here.<br />If Penn's goal was to craft a film that would make you think then it is a triumph.<br />I don't want to provide spoilers so I will summarize the film as...<br />Overly long.<br />Beautiful score from Eddie Vedder.<br />An amazing glimpse into one mans life.<br />Frustrating.<br />Awe inspiring.<br />Beautiful....and...<br />Recommended.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The tension between the characters is fun to watch.  Legal drama is always there.  Good court room battles.  Not predictable.
B000S1L7IU|5.0|This was a very good book, I read this on 12-30-2010, in my notes I noted that this was a good book, if I had thought that it was boring, I would tell you, but all I can say is that Clive Cussler wrote another Fantastic book.
B000FZETKC|1.0|Okay, granted a near-\\"curmudgeon\\" adult of my mature nature might sniff peevishly at this type of you've-seen-it-all-before potboiler, but I swear to High Holy Heaven SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL contained the most intolerably insipid dialogue you could possibly imagine.<br /><br />As for its poorly acted, fluff-stuffed plot (boy rejects girl he secretly adores), you'll have a hard time convincing yourself this \\"serious,\\" self-indulgent melodrama isn't tongue-in-cheek satire taken to the outer limits of inanity<br /><br />An utter waste of time!
B00CL68BK2|5.0|It was a great story and very well written movie. I recommend this movie for couples to watch.  I just wish that it was not 5.99 to watch on HD.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|If you are a fan of the old-school space shooter games, get it!  If you aren't, then get it cause it's the FAOTD!  Either way... WINNING!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|After watching this movie in the theater, I rushed right out and bought the DVD as soon as it was released. I love this movie. I love John Carter and Dejah Thoris. I want a dog creature like the one that faithfully follows him across the planet. This movie has everything: Action, Adventure, Intrigue, Romance, Space Travel, Time Travel. And 2D or 3D. You need to get this movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the truth. Anyone can do it. You will see results. Jillian is the absolute best. I didn't even diet and I lost three pounds in ten days.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After its 3rd reading this book still captivates the inquisitive mind. Modern man's capacity for war, and our ability to abstract ourselves from the theatre of war, seems prophetic when considered against card's 35yr tome.<br /><br />The battleroom is the futuristic  relative of a predator drone control room, only today with 18yr olds targeting \\"buggers\\", rather than 11yr olds in Enders Game. A must read for all Sci Fi fans.
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|Loved this movie since I was a kid.  I want to focus on how beautiful it is in HD.  My wife walked in mid movie and thought I was watching something current and on blu-ray.  Kudos to Amazon for streaming such a pristine version of the movie.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great job Justin, love listening to it in my car, and plus even on my kindle.  Not bad for buying it on CD, and getting it on my kindle music cloud. Nice. Two thumbs up. =0)
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When this came out for kindle fire I downloaded it right away. after a few plays though....it just stiled working. I love this game....but I have to keep redownloading it and it loses my progress.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love this game that I have to play it when my sons are in bed. Yeah, if my 2 year old see this game he'll go nuts for it.  I love that you log on to FB, and play against your friends. Plus theres new games every week. I love it, and I think I got my husband hook on it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works really well. I like how they explain how to use it in a fast and easy to understand method. Best free Calculator... no complaints from me.
B00BJ7G1VK|5.0|I love this book.  The recipes are great and easy (usually).  I first saw it at a friend's house (a chef), and decided I had to have it.  I bought the Kindle edition against my instinct, but am loving it because you can take the whole thing to the grocery store, or anywhere else easier than the whole book.  I still may buy the real book too because it's so great.
B005TVYVI2|3.0|Very helpful for pacing, but could be a better product.  Controls are fussy (not always responsive), and if I haven't used the timer in a while, I forget which buttons to push to do what (not intuitive or labelled).  It would be nice to have a better way to attach the timer to goggle straps (the provided clip is bulky and meant for running).
6305014140|5.0|Ninja Scroll is an awesome adult anime. It is from 1993 and is directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. This is a really cool movie that any hardcore anime fan should see. It has awesome characters and villains, and lots of action. The movie is beautifully drawn and is quite gory in some parts. It also has a nice love story between the two main characters Jubei and Kagero.<br /><br />A great anime that I totally recommend.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The topic of this book, preparing children ages 6-12 to fight stellar battles is very unique; however, I felt that it also gave sanction to state sponsored child abuse.  Orson Scott Card writes well and is very entertaining.  If fantasy tickles you, this book is well worth the time; otherwise it is a good time filler.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|Got Stadium Arcadium for my nephew.at Amazon .com, for his Birthday. Said he loved it. Played it for days. It drove me crazy.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Not crazy about the narration style at first, but got used to it, and really liked the global perspective. Read it in a weekend. Pretty riveting. What's most impressive is the authenticity with which brooks writes. Makes the whole thing spookily plausible.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I don't know how long I spent reading this series, but it sure was worth it.  What a great journey...
B00992CF6W|5.0|i got this game as soon as it came out and it is awesome and next update you will be able to have skins and you can activate minecraft pe with your mojang account
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Wonderful plot and story line. I hope Vikings continues to be produced. Outstanding first season. Watching this series causes me to pause and think that society has not advanced past this era; except for the weaponry.
0439882826|5.0|Gave this to my 6 years old grandson who is into super heroes on his birthday and he was totally blown away by the intricate design and mind-boggling work of art! The adults who grew up during the first Star Wars movie were so impressed by all the attention to detail. This will be in the family treasure!
B000002IST|3.0|After recently reviewing this album for this first time in over 20 years, I still could not find much redeemable about it. I was hoping my tastes had changed and matured, but not the case here. This is a classic case of a band becoming a parody of themselves..\\"We Can't Dance\\"...indeed.  Hard to believe they did \\"Invisible Touch\\" before this...the difference between the two albums are night and day. It lacks anywhere near the imagination and energy of that album. Cleary, this was a band out of energy, and out of ideas. The one thing they did do right was essentially calling it quits after this album (if you don't include 'Calling All Stations')
B005R7DAWG|4.0|I've read the count of monte cristo before in English but I wanted to read it again in its original language. Love it
B009EFP278|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with the songs on this album that I had NOT heard....the ones that I knew well were listened to happily, but the new ones are wonderful, too. Olly continues to show that he can jump across genres, and present pop, rap, ballads, and more, with equally awesome results!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down! The story of this family will draw you should you till the end.
B000U6BT40|4.0|Cool sci-fi and funny banter. The commercials on SciFi Channel were compelling, but I never had time to watch. Found this in Amazon Prime Instant Vids and now I'm hooked.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|It tells one amazing story and offers a glimpse into the mind and soul of the world's greatest heroes.  Read it quick and learned a lot about myself and got totally inspired. The story itself was amazing and rivoting.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Clint Eastwood & Amy Adams were outstanding in this movie.  Of course I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|It is hard to not give this book a 5 Star rating, after all the author was killed shortly before i read it.  He is without a doubt one hell of a hero and a wonderful man and example.  The story he tells, is sort of dry and not as inspiring as other books of this genre.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This game is a very poor app. I have the kindle fire 1st edition. Whenever I play it then close it for a 10 minute minimum it wont open. It always sends me home. Creators!!! Please fix that!! I've had to reinstall it like, a hundred times!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I  loved this seriers.  It had history, deep characters, awesome settings.  Really, just soemthing I could get in and enjoy.  I would highly recommend this series.
B000JML90Y|5.0|This book is one of the few books that have really changed, if not the world, surely our appreciation of it. Poor churches who cannot see that correct knowledge of Nature is only bringing us nearer to God as He is.
B009C7JS14|5.0|Really like this app the only thing that would make it better is if it had a 5 day forecast
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|My son and I play tog e th err r, he covers his eyes sometimes in anticipation of something scary popping out, we loved it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Thought I would have to do some adaptation - literally no thinking involved, so simple.  I'd recommend this to anyone.
B00C7DGQ9C|4.0|I would never rank this as a masterpiece, but it is a lot of fun to watch.  Try not to think too hard about the details and just enjoy the rather good stunts.  You could pick at the plot or the acting but its obvious the actors were really enjoying themselves and that sort of infects you as you watch it.<br /><br />If you looking for something to fill a night in, you likely won't be upset.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it. Very heart warming read it in one night. Great author will read more by her. Easy reader book
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Same comments from the Hunger Games,,, lots of fun,,, sorry to see series ended,,, like the whole series,,, not just YA
B000R9RGF6|4.0|I heard one of the songs of this album in a TV commercial, and I fell in love with it! This is how I met the artist. Although this CD has many great songs, some of them have like a sad cut.
B00CBRADU2|3.0|what do u expect from an old governor from Calif,,, it was ok shoot em up a lot, but was fun to watch
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|I love this artist. His music is very calming to my ears. I would recommend this album. Besides  piano, it has other instruments like the violin. Love the combination!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I see where district 13 with its structured life style will be at logger heads with district 12,,, if she decides to re-create the series,,, I think they r doing it a disservice saying for YA
B00AG297GK|3.0|Overall this movie was pretty good. It's stereotypical and offensive which is what Cohen is know for and good at and has an Adam Sandler movie feel at the end. Not a must see, but if you've got some time to kill, go for it.
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|again and old guy action adventure,,, do not expect much other than a lot of explosions and gunfire,, and you wont be disappointed
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I love all things Sherlock and this series is no disappointment.  I will watch it again.  Love Lucy Liu as Watson.
B00992CF6W|5.0|watch out for creepers and skelitons and zombies and spiders because when you download this you will love it.Bad part MOJANG NEEDS TO HAVE MORE UPDATES PLEASE
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Keeps you on edge throughout.  If you liked The Hunger Games or World War Z you will like this. Wicked good. When you read it, you will enjoy that pun.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great Syfy show, probably one of the best made ever. Fantastic special effects. After the first season I can't wait to watch season 2, 3, 4 and 5!!!<br /><br />Robert
B00CFOXBX2|5.0|Great movie!!!! Very intriguing & suspenseful. A must have for your library.  It's full of drama and twists for this movie.
8866131105|2.0|I ordered this book thinking it was the one I wanted and as it arrived it wasn't at all. Normally I wouldn't be upset but while I was ordering it the description, picture, etc. was the exact one I ordered last time. There is just no way to differentiate
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Fun to watch but of course some is not possible because it is a movie that was put together by someones ideas.
B0058YPL66|5.0|The fairytail characters you remember from your childhood will never be the same.  In this series there are twist turns and frenamies (enamies that are friends) around every corner.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I had a great time playing this game. It was loads of mindless fun and a great way to kill time.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Please fix the issue for Kindle Fire first gen. Constantly force closing. Can't use anymore! Help! This is my favorite application and don't want to find another one.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Tried the teaser chapter 1, decided that my friend's recommendation as well as the first chapter were enough to warrant a purchase. Unfortunately, the book is a pretty big letdown. I won't write spoilers, but the author's attempt at explaining how everything falls apart is unbelievable (in a bad way, as in not convincing). Humanity picks itself up in a boring way, and exacts vengeance by...being very thoughtful and boring. Try it if you like zombies (I do), avoid it if you need excitement to justify a zombie book.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this to replace the one I had before that I watch to much. It is a great movies.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|a fun game different from your subway surfers and temple run get as fast as you can hurry what are you waiting for
B004SCN2F6|4.0|This game is one of a few that has shown it's potential for an ever growing droid game market and how in some ways games as well done as this one will put a little hurt on main game systems.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Fit the Jack Reacher character. Glad that the explicit gratuitous torture scenes were avoided, but there was less Reacher superhuman physicality than in other books. Still good.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|It will stay in my collection as a prequel to the Lord f the rings series but won't revisit it often.
B0096BIENY|5.0|This recording is not only priced reasonably, but the song selection is diverse & the harmony is amazing. I have an extensive CD collection & this recording was the best addition I've made to it in a long time.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|To the developer: make a sequel,  make it a touch longer if possible. Be warned that this city game is extremely  addictive!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|never ever freezes and its addictive when your bored:) This game is very fun for kindle fire!! I love it, its my favorite game to play!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle Season 5 is my favorite seaon yet! The characters are funnier, the murders are even more interesting, and the chemistry between Castle and Beckett is still holding strong. Season 5 is a must-see for any Castle fan.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|really enjoyed the continuing story of 3 women from 3 generations and how the mystery was presented and solved. it was a book i enjoyed coming back to in my limited reading times. thanks, ms. morton, for your tale weaving...
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|If you are a fan of Arnold then it is worth a rent.  I just felt the story was weak and predictable.  Characters were shallow and under developed, even for an action movie.
B00CBRADU2|2.0|I was looking forward to Arnolds latest action movie, but...<br />For me, it started off slow, then puttered along and finally fizzled out. Yes, there were some good shoot 'em up moments, but over all ... eh. The comedy portions were flat and forgetable. The predictability of the movie made it pretty easy to push pause, go get some food or more drinks or check on something around the house and then come back to it without feeling like I had missed anything. If you're a Prime memeber, wait and it should be avalible within a month or two.
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|This was a pretty good album actually. here's my favorite songs from it.<br /><br />1: Back To You<br />2: Days And Days<br />3: Bitches Love Me<br />4: My Homie's Still<br />5: Beat The S***<br />6: Lay It Down<br />7: Hello<br /><br />I give this whole album a 8.5/10. Nice one wayne.
159463176X|5.0|Lives change but hearts and emotions remain with us forever. Hosseni's latest book, And The Mountains Echoed, is truly a tour de force in how our own reality is shaped by our internal thoughts and emotions. From the beginning allegory of Baba Ayub with three sons and two daughters and how Baba sacrifices his youngest son, Qais, drawn by lot rather than have all five children perish. Baba wishes his son be safe and live happily ever after is an internal truth for all believers who know that this world is but a series of events planned by God, even though our finite minds will never completely understand until we, too, are  in that place of divs and jinns. When the div says that \\"cruelty and benevolence are but shades of the same color,\\" the allegory sets the tone for the cast of characters to follow, brilliantly written by nine POVs and how their lives were but choices of \\"the same color.\\"<br />As life recycles and a new generation is born and takes over the task of making choices, both good and bad, it's no coincidence that Abdullah in his old age, affectionately known as Baba by his daughter who chooses to care for him in his senility as she did her mother before her death; until all of us go to that place where we want for nothing and \\"life is good.\\" Hosseni's storytelling is spellbinding in its metaphors and parables of life. His narrative is much more than sibling love, parent-child love, love of family; it is about our own inhumanity and humanness that is shaped more by courage and faith than random events. The nine back stories and mini plots are but this writer's tool to convey this love story of epic proportion. Love is measured by feathers rather than memories as the young Abdullah and Pari sit under the tree and drift into an untroubled sleep where everything is \\"clear and radiant\\" once more.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A very entertaining book - although the ending was predictable, I found myself growing to like the narrator more and more as the book went on.  Well written.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|superb acting, outstanding script, compelling story. in the realm of 6 feet under and weeds as far as story and antihero.<br />dramatic series don't get much better than this.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Such a great game! Good for teaching someone how to manage and save money! Should give you more land space to start off with though.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I have read most of the Reacher novels, enjoyed almost all of them, but this one was bad. If you are a fan, skip this one. Illogical scenes, mostly boring for the first 400 pages, then Reacher takes out 21 people, calls it a day, and the FBI drops him off at the nearest intersection. Say what? If you started with this book you would never read another in the series. This one was written just for a payday.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Liked the game...very addictive.  I just wish there was more variety in symbols as well as more color contrast to make it easier on the eyes.  It's also not totally free you have to pay to continue the game after a few levels.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|Very well written, as are all others Steinbeck books I have read.  Really conveys the suffering of the dirt poor migrant workers during the depression.  The feeling they could only count on each other is very strongly in evidence.  I guess the reason I cannot give it a higher rating is the story essentially was told and retold throughout the book.  Very glad I read it, but preferred other titles.  Would certainly recommend it however.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My mincraft won't update I go to app store and still won't update . The update was supposed to be in April but it's May and I still haven't got an update !!!:(
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's just a simply great game. Great way to pass the time and its fun for any body to play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a fun game, there is lots of action, hopping trains and avoiding the police and collecting coins while avoiding being smashed by a train
B007HACDLK|5.0|Highly recommended to all Mitch Rapp followers.  Real world events and easy to believe world situations. Can't wait for the next one.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|With all of the beauty and production values of the Zefirelli version, my former favorite, but with all of the music instead of the many cuts, and a fine Frontali Giorgio Ghermont instead of the bellowing of the Cornell MacNeill version of &#34;Di Provenza.&#34;  Wonderfully lit and photographed with excellent visual directorial choices, and admirable passion and patience from Maazel.  Gheorghiu is virtually flawless and visually arresting and engaging.  No need no look for another version -- especially at this price!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A great book to read when all you know is the movie. This book makes me want to read the rest.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|good young adults novel, interesting story line and fast read. I have read them more than once and love this series
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Finally, a movie that is better than the book. I read the book and it was okay, but the film was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence well deserved that Oscar. She continues to be a beautiful and amazingly talented actress. I have yet to see anything from her that I didn't like.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this was an amazing game... I got hooked on it for hours:) I hope you enjoy his as much as me!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Plots full of twists and turns, heart-warming and heart-wrenching unfoldings, quick and intelligent dialogue, glamorous locales, exquisite photography, gorgeous costuming, and mostly LIFE in all its highs and lows at all levels of existence  ... what's not to love about this series?  I recommend this series to anyone who can relate to dealing with the complexities of life which mostly are fired at us point-blank ... everything ranging from courage to cowardice, open-mindedness to stubornness, moderation to recklessness, wisdom to foolishness, birth to death, loyalty to betrayal, love to hate ... and back again ... and all the spaces in between.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a beautiful book and it does not go as expected which makes it much more interesting.  It takes place in Britain. A rather hapless young woman takes a job caring for a paralyzed man.  He is rich and angry and she is a lost soul.  Together they figure out some things but it certainly isn't the usual she-saves-him/he-saves-her type of story.  The intrigue keeps building and serious questions about life choices have to be faced.  It will keep you guessing and it is well worth the read.  Highly recommended.  I want to read more by this author.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book! Would definitely read it again and I would recommend it if you have read the other 2 books.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Several songs that the radio stations should be picking up.  Very talented musicians in the cast of Nashville.  T Bone Burnett never disappoints.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Once I read  The Hunger Games, Icouldn't wait to read the next book in the series. It is a great book and an easy read.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Dame Dench plays any role with perfection.  Very interesting characters.  Lots of fund to watch with friends.  The scenery was filmed exceptionally well.  Great adventure.
B000063UR1|5.0|Saw this movie when I was a kid. Didn't know it then, but I was a sci-fi geek. This movie combines drama with science fiction. Like Star Trek, it requires the audience to listen and feel, not just watch. Highly recommend to any sci-fi fanatic. When it has a great story, the special effects aren't that important.
B00BEYYEE4|5.0|Russell Crowe always turns in an outstanding character. Good casting with Wahlberg and Zeta-Jones.  I will watch it with friends and recommend it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Some of the funniest scenes yet.  One of the better seasons.  A definite must<br />or the Big Bang collector A1
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This was a great addition to the Star Trek story. I enjoyed it very much and recommend it  to any StarTrek fan.
B002ZB26AO|3.0|With virtually no basis for comparison, there's little to say other than this book paints a bleak picture of the events of the last few generations for a few North Koreans now defected into other countries. Virtually all of the stories are shatteringly tragic, so steel your resolve at the outset. This is not going to be fun.<br /><br />I rather wished to have heard more about the post-transition lives of these defectors that we come to know in the first two-thirds or three-quarters of the book, and while the author does briefly nod at the unfinished narrative, it still feels a bit more like a power outage than an ending. My other chief complaint is that the transition between the various narratives is often jarring. It isn't always clear to me why we're spending more pages with certain subjects.<br /><br />That said, if you want to learn anything about life in North Korea (and assuredly to have a greater appreciation of live in the developed world), I can't imagine a better way than to ask the people who have lived it, which is precisely what the author has done.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|Hannibal himself is played in a very studied emotional way with a believable sense of menace just below the surface. The plot line is just a bit loose and although the series has a great deal of talent the script does not take full advantage. I think this will be eventually corrected in season 2.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|Trying to integrate my Kindle app version with the one on my phone has proven to be difficult. It won't sign in both with the same ID. The app is useful but would be better with that integration working.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game. Better than most of the puzzle games on the market. Well worth the money. The many levels has me coming back over and over again.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Grandson says he love the game and thrill we got it for him. I feel if must me a great game for him playing it over and over..
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is a great game.  The graphics are good and the play is fun.  It gets a little repetitive at times but still can't stop playing it.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|Grandson says he love the game and thrill we got it for him. I feel if must me a great game for him playing it over and over..
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|This movie could have been funny without the extreme raunchiness. Relying on foul language and extreme sexual humor shows a tremendous lack of creativity.

B006M4F67A|5.0|This is a great app.<br />Because of the 3-D effect, matching tiles is much easier than some of the other apps I have used. I also like the different configurations, which makes the game more challenging.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Grandson says he love the game and thrill we got it for him. I feel if must me a great game for him playing it over and over..
B00C1040TO|5.0|As a professional musician this is an invaluable tool. Really helps get you on track.  Extremely flexible and easy to operate

B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|This app takes up so much memory it wouldn't load on my iPad so we never could play it. We deleted several other apps off the iPad but it still wouldn't load.

B006BDHAX0|3.0|I liked the variety of layouts but this got very easy and there weren't enough boards to last more than a few weeks.

B00CL68BK2|5.0|I was worried that the hype would leave me disappointed, but it was unique and refreshing and awesome. Five stars.

B00BU18U82|5.0|My friend has this app and he loves it so I thought I give it a try and I'm hooked. I play this app all the time. Even though they could make the controls better it's still fun. I play this game whenever I can and I plan on getting the PC version to. Hopefully they will ad more equipment in the future updates though. So if you were sketchy on whether to buy it or not I would deffenetly buy it and recommend it. :)
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|Grandson says he love the game and thrill we got it for him. I feel if must me a great game for him playing it over and over..
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the reminders of early text games like Crystal Cavern and arcade games like Joust and Burger Man.  Playful and fun.

B009G41CG2|1.0|The Game quits, and there is no option for help, so if you can't find a pair you are stuck.  Also, you can't re-shuffle.

B005COO1X6|5.0|I love Stephen King books & this one was great! Loved it! I've been a fan of short horror stories for most of my life. I read almost all of his books!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is the type of Mahjong that I've come to enjoy playing. It's great with training the brain. It's play is more like the real thing than most. The only con I can think of is that it's a bit hard at times to tell the pieces that are available. This isn't something that's this games fault as it's really a 3-d game. I have this problem with any 3-D game displayed on a 2-D platform.<br /><br />You'll really enjoy this version.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Great movie, can't wait till it arrives!! I think this movie is suitable for ages 10+. This one is a little scarier than the other ones for younger kids.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|The price was right for this little software networking tool. It assisted me with troubleshooting & installing my wireless network.The tool is easy to use & I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to help them set up a wireless network.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|I thought it was a great movie. Natalie Portman was awesome as usual and the actor who portrayed Thor did an excellent job too.<br />Definitely for teens and older though.
B007HO392S|5.0|Love Carrie. Met her in person, she smelled SO good....<br />This is her best album so far... To bad she's married now.....<br /><br />Ex-Rockstar
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Love the story line, but got bogged down in the extensive history included. A good read after seeing the movie because of further character development.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|Great Bond movie with a lot of action and edge of your seat suspense really a true Bond film. This one rates right up there with those you wish to see again for what you may have missed.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I began the Sookie Stackhouse series a few years ago and absolutely could not wait for each new books' debuts however the last two prior to this book lacked the intensity and spark that earlier books in the series had...thinking that this being the last book, Harris would end this series with a bang so I pre-ordered Dead Ever After and I feel like I've wasted a good amount of money.  I don't have an issue with the plot but it definitely could have more spunk and excitement.  I feel like Harris was tired of the characters and the series and basically just wanted it over.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I have read 4 of his books and this was as good as the others, I look  forward to the next one.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|its great love it best ever not for little kids though<br />each floor is like a riddle if you like brain twisters
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I thought that the many soap operas contained within the series intriguing. I also believe that the acting seemed to enhance the story lines which of themselves were well written and presented.<br /><br />I wish that there were more series of the quality of the Downton Abbey.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|AFTER SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS OF RESEARCH THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST KNIFE HIKING CAMPING SURVIVAL IF YOU WILL YOU CAN GO WRONG WHIT IT.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|I am an addict now. I love this show.. I now have to watch it every Wednesday night. What a great show.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Where's the exit button- back button doesn't work either. Please finish the program with these simple actions and I would give it five-stars. This app rivals the best programmers except as noted. I would pay the money for this (got on FAOTD) given if is compatible with android exit conventions.<br />Great game play and graphically wonderful, nice audio track, small file size, and low permissions. Samsung Galaxy SII<br />UPDATE: Based on feedback just received, there's a well hidden \\"X\\" in the upper right-hand side of the screen that allows and instant exit. Would still be nice if \\"back\\" feature was enabled, but the X works. Upgrade from 4 to 5 stars. Nice!
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|I had preconceived notions about this movie.  I'd wanted to see it since it opened and missed it in the theatres.  Well worth the wait!  Lots of enjoyable twists and turns, great character development and my preconceived notion came to fruition and even more!
B005CVWWJY|3.0|Initially, I wanted to give this book 1 star because there are so many thing wrong with it. But as you can see, eventually it turned out to be 3 stars because the last 25% of the book are quite well done, and the whole thing turns into a bit of a page-turner.<br />Let's dissect this a little bit:<br />While I was reading it, the lack of imagination of such a 'science fiction' writer was almost painful to watch, like a train-crash in slow motion. The problem is that the author doesn't actually imagine a world in 2044, he simply uses his love for the 80s and for MMO computer games and extrapolates that into the future. Throw a bit of gritty cyberpunk into the mix and you get pretty close to this book.<br />The whole thing reads like a movie manuscript: the feelings of the main character are described quite awkwardly, you can plainly see that he just wants to move on with the action. Also, drawing the world outside of the main computer game is done in an almost hasty fashion. For example, the main character has to take a bus to get from one city to another - but instead of using this to give readers a view of the world, it's dealt with on maybe 3 pages, and then he arrives in the next city. For me, this makes the whole book seem a little childish and oversimplified. In general, the author doesn't seem to have too much trust in the readership anyway: even mild forms of witticism are explained, to make sure that even the dumbest readers don't miss it. Maybe my expectation towards science fiction writing is too high, but I found that this was a little bit too dumbed down in places.<br /><br />However, at around the 70% mark, the book picks up, and then the plot thickens as more and more is at stake. Plot holes are still in abundance, but action scenes are definitely the author's strength, and you can feel that he is getting into his strength. The last 15% of the book were really well done, and I couldn't put it down because I really wanted to know how it all ended.<br /><br />I'm not sure where this leaves me with the author: I'd probably give other books of his a shot. I can only hope that in his next effort, he learns how to paint the picture of a world in the future properly, and I think then things will fall into place for him. I've heard since that this book might be turned into a movie, and I think that might actually be worth watching.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|It seems that the books I really enjoy reading (and possibly re-reading), come to me by chance, mostly being suggested by Amazon based on my \\"buying history\\". Anthony Ryan has written a book with a narrative pull that blew me away. It was difficult to put my Kindle down and I wished the weekend was longer.<br />It might be because I am European (and above the average interested in history) that I immediately fell for this book. The setting is familiar and so is the landscape. The story is unveiled almost too slowly and the reader is tempted to turn the pages faster just to see what is waiting around the corner. There is enough psychology, politics, religion - and mystery - in this book to allow the characters to develop.<br />This book is mainly about Vaelin al Sorna and his journey discovering who is friend and who is foe, being caught between his sense of loyality and politics. Or is it all just a way to excuse himself for his anti-hero acts? If you want to know more, read for yourself. I am looking forward to read the rest.
0062082353|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!!  I learned more about our service people and what they do for us from this book than I have before! Just amazing in every way!!! Thank you all you vets and active service people for all you do for my family  and myself!!  THANK YOU!! Joel!!!

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I enjoyed it. I would have liked a little less story. Great graphics too. So would like to play the sequel.
0385360185|4.0|The end does make you wonder if there will be more......I guess we will have to wait and see or in my case listen.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The hunger games are over, future generations will not have to go through this killing event. It is nice to see that district 12 has people leaving there again. With Peers and Katriss together there is hope for the future.  There was too many lives lost, but that should be over foe ever now.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love her music. She is so good at what she does. My daughter lives her music to. 5 stars from my daughter.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I found it very interesting to learn about the existence of the Orphan Trains. The book held my attention and was a pretty quick read. I felt that some of the characters could have been more deeply developed.
B000067J24|5.0|This film is full of great Samba music, beautiful people and happy fantasy storylines.<br />Is it an Oscar contender, no, but I put this on when I want to feel good and Penelope<br />Cruz is a dazzler!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|So very well written.  It may take a while to get into it, but then you are spellbound.  What will Harold encounter down the road?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this set to see the weather at several locations including Disneyland, where we often visit.  I can plan my day with the hourly forecast, keep track of the weather where the children and grandchildren live, and when we travel, I can track the weather at my destination.

B008BO61BE|5.0|screaming for vengance is a very heavy album and this 30th anniversary edition of this excellent cover art of staying cool is accompanied by a live DVD Festival USA 83 where you can see the band playing the full light of day without purpose simply recommend playing heavy metal fans both new and the usual hope you enjoy it as much as I
0385751893|5.0|Holocaust based through the eyes of 2 young boys, the book was also made into a movie, this version had the movie cover.
B007IPJMCM|5.0|when this album came out there was no doubt that would come to be essential in music or become a metal classic on guitar genius and fantastic Dime of vocalist Phil was the perfect blend to awaken the most violent musical desires of the fans already celebrating its 20th anniversary this re-release comes with an unreleased theme Piss.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Had nothing but problems with this app for my facebook on my kindle fire...do not recommend getting this app at all!

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Hooked on this app. I love this game even my kids like playing this game.<br />It's awesome. I have not been able to put my kindle down since I got this game.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I have to say I am a fan of Backgammon anyway.  It is quick and easy to play and helps to feel the wait time in the doctors waiting room.  LOL
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I played this game &amp; was not impressed. I love these types of games &amp; usually don't have anything bad to say. Unfortunately I feel this game fell short. There is no hint button for when you get stuck. The only option you have is the game spoilers when you click on your diary. Also, the diary is a pain to get to because you have to open your inventory every time because it is in your inventory instead of a static icon on the,side. Graphics were ok, but not great. I would have to say this game is a waste of money.
B000053VAF|5.0|The mo is arrived very quickly and was in great shape. I suppose my expectations were not very high, but they were clearly exceeded and I would recommend this seller to anyone :)
B000K1MUA2|4.0|If you are a small business owner or thinking about it, this book will provide the &#34;Doh,&#34; moment. Learn to tell the difference between running a business or having a job.
B000002J09|5.0|I can listen to this album any day, any time of the day.  Each time I listen to this album, I discover something new.  This album never fade away, it just stay in me and become a part of myself.
B009R659L8|4.0|too many people in the story. I had to read the first 18 chaps twice. will still read her books
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy escape games and this one is pretty fun. Seems simple but it was technically levels 1-8 so i would imagine once they add more it will hopefully provide more challenge. Really glad it was free!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Different twist on the ending then usual. Many mother-son relationships like this.  Very good movie and recommend to watch it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Love Once Upon A Time!!! Can't wait for it to come back this fall!!! I bought season two on amazon so that my boyfriend could watch it too. He couldn't get enough of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The pocket version takes up a lot of space, but it's worth it. It has a lot of similarities, but you can't use the nether reactor. Not in my version, anyway. It has great quality. The pocket version has almost anything from apples to shovels, but I love it even if I can never find enough obsidian to make a nether portal. It's with me on the go. Though when I'm trying to find friends on the WiFi it's always too slow for my patience. The pocket version doesn't have moonstone, enderman, or slenderman. Too bad. It also doesn't show the moon or the sun. It doesn't have a lot of stuff, but it's awesome anyway. Get it. :)
0066620996|4.0|An excellent read...informative and addresses the adult learning processes with ease.  An interesting first read for all first year doctoral students of management.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Cut the rope is ok. But when it comes to cut the rope experiments it is a awesome game!!!!!!!! When I got it it was the free app of the day that is fun!!!!!!!
B001XUPD94|5.0|Clear and great just as it was back than. I would watch it over and over again. I like the quality of movies as well.

B000O14VAU|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies.. I really like the trilogy they made.  I own all of them, and I would tell other people to buy them as we'll, because its not a waste of money, great story, great action and well worth the money.  That's why I rated of a 5 star.  It deserves it.  Thanks for listening.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and super addicting! I can't stop playing it and it works great on the kindle fire.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The interesting story line kept me reading. In the end, however, I didn't really like the characters very much, and didn't love the book-it was just O.K.
B00CBKLO52|1.0|This app is a rip off!!! When I tried to play it, it didn't work!!! Do not get this app !!!
1451627297|5.0|This is a very thick book.  Mr. King did extensive research into the time period, which explores the events surrounding the Kennedy assassination with a science fiction flare.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|i like leps world because its like super mario bros. but who ever made this game might be copying mario
B003YUF0GC|4.0|This GPS works very well  and I rely on it extensively for use with my laptop so that I can have a chartplotter on my boat.  My only complaint is the strong magnet included in this unit which I'm not a fan of on a boat next to a compass etc.
B00A77II0U|4.0|kept me interested. enjoyed it and appreciated the guide .. had to use that several times but I would have quit in frustration. otherwise.
B0067R0APK|3.0|The old version was easier to use.  Since the update I find the use of ease is not as friendly.  Too much swiping and scrolling.  I'll be using my other weather app now.
0312117337|5.0|I've been wanting the Osho tarot deck for quite some time and finally bought it. I love it! It has some of the same elements of a traditional deck, but is also different in ways that expand the reading experience.
B000HL09MG|2.0|Umm....this has got to be the strangest movie ever. Just don't understand why they even wasted time making this movie. Absolutely horrible.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is amazing. it can not possibly get any better. I love the graphics and the level of difficultly. I am a major fan of Michael Jackson so the only way to make this game better is to add a car dedicated to Michael Jackson. or you could update the game and make one of the locations around neverland ranch. please?!?!?
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I have seen this show a million times and NEVER get tired of watching it. Hope it never goes off air!!!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next installment. Once you read one of these books Archer has you hooked. If only I didn't have to wait so long for the next book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does the job I need it to do. No negative words here. Plus, it's free! So get it and enjoy it. I do wish it turned sideways though, but it's cool.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|The stories are good although short.  It was OK.  Not what I expected from Michael Connelly based on the other books I have read.
B004WOH19S|4.0|Not his best book, but a good read.<br />I am still reading this book so maybe there will be a surprise ending!
B007NZ7LIY|4.0|That being said a TON of the sounds are completely different.  The music isn't the same either, so disappointing 8(.  Imagine playing Super Mario brothers and its not the same Music and sound effects.  I hope there is an update to fix it,  maybe an option on it to go back to the original sound effects.  I do want to comment that the graphics seem exactly the same, which is great, and I'm glad there was an update to Android.  Please fix the music sounds 8)<br /><br />Its still TOTALLY worth picking up,  I had to take away 2 stars,  the sound is SO important.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It's entertaining. For some reason I like the coin dozer games. They're slow and there is never enough coins unless you buy more, you know like Vegas.....but over all I do like the game.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book but sorry to see it end. Loved the whole series. Great ending for Skookie though. Maybe she will start a new vampire series. At least we still have True Blood to watch.
B001X0ZKM4|4.0|I have been a massive batman fan ever since I started watching the animated series as a kid. I have to say as a batman fan this is definitely one of my favorite movies starring the caped crusader. Michael Keaton does a fantastic job as the dark knight himself and Michelle Pfeiffer is the arguably the best actress to dawn the catwoman outfit. This is a must have for batman fans as well as those who really love a great action movie. Do yourself a favor and get this movie.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The first half of this book really draws you in.  You really get excited about what is to come... then nothing comes.  It's like the author just needed to get the book done and sent to the publisher.  It was one of the most disappointing books I have ever read.  And the let down that is the end of the book is even more pronounced because the beginning is so awesome.  Oh well....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It's an awesome read for all ages. It's thrilling, it's fun, it's an escape from reality if even for only a little while. You won't regret reading it,
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|love the game.  multiplayer is fun and keeps me coming back. as it gets harder you do get to a point whit re you have to spend a little.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|This book does not deviate from its core message. I recommend it to anybody seeking to be inspired to get going.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I didn't watch this series when it debuted, but now I'm hooked. The characters are well developed and great story lines.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I am a huge fan of the book, and was hoping the movie did the book justice.  Thankfully, the movie did a great job with the first portion of the book.  The detail and quality of the movie are what we have come to expect form the director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  I'm looking forward to the next two movies!
0345803485|5.0|If you enjoy sex, want to escape reality or have an image of some hot tottie named Christian Grey with great feet saunter around in your head then buy this book!!!! Full of eroticism, E.L. took the cake with this masterpiece..there are many others like it but they can't hold a torch to her.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I've listened to Demi before and liked her music, but was still skeptical about buying her new album.  Now that I own the CD, I am happy to report that this is one of the rare CDs where every track is great (if not amazing)!
B00AR83PN4|3.0|Kind of difficult or confusing for me. I am usually fairly sharp with cube games but this one challenged me somewhat. Don't know if I would recommend to family or friend.
B00B2PHSIY|1.0|The filter broke on the first day of use, within the first 20 minutes.  This product is a piece of crap, do not buy.  While snorkeling in Mexico, the filter fell off because the tab that is supposed to secure the filter to the Go Pro broke!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This cube game made a lot of sense to me. I enjoy playing it. Once I start, I try to beat the clock by taking the least amount of time as possible to clear cubes. Habit forming
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Loved the Mistborn Trilogy and thought I would give this a try - enjoyed it just as much.  Looking forward to the next one.
B00CE004XM|5.0|Alright, I've had SEESAW for about a week now. (Since it came out) and it's all I've been listening to. I Love it ! Kinda Blues, Kinda Jazz, Kinda Mowtown, it's got it all. There isn't a lot of fluff or studio mastery, just good raw tunes. Great musicians playing music. Joe pulls off some really juicy guitar & Beth just opens her mouth and lets it fly. Hard, soft, gravely, playful ....... How refreshing to see actual \\"Musicians\\" who actually have talent, bring us such a wonderful gift. A Breath of Fresh Air. Thank You :)
1476734941|4.0|The scientific word uses the metric system, so should this book! C'mon, was this book targeted at the US market?
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The story is essentially zombies everywhere trying to eat you. But in reality it's about the relationships between the characters. Some you love, some you like, some you hate and they all have to deal with each other in a trying situation. So I give this four stars because although it is about the people and how they react and behave and interact with one another in the zombie apocalypse, after three seasons you may say to yourself &#34;I've seen enough zombies to last a life time&#34;.
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|It was just what I wanted, the quality was quite good and the rental fast. Sometimes it takes longer but this one was pretty fast
B003UBTX6S|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing! I couldn't stop reading it! This is the best series I have ever read and I'm only on the third book now!!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Not as exciting as other games, it was disappointing needless to say.I don't like your telling me how many words to use in my review.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I had a lot if fun playing g this.  Challenging and makes you use your head.<br />I hope to find more puzzle mysteries like this soon.
B00821OX98|5.0|I usually don't watch tv shows because I can't stand tv ads.  But with amazon prime I was able to watch two seasons in two weeks making it worth watching.  If you are in to sci fi  I feel this is the best series since x-files.  With way more action and intensity
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I am not even done with this book yet and practically have the chills with every lesson. Instead of a chapter like setting that has many pages per section, Pressfield writes in life changing sections that may only at times be a paragraph long. In my opinion he teaches us the secrets to happiness, self love, success and an overall well being from the depths of our souls. I am a picky reader and this one is a keeper. I am even thinking of having a poster in my room so that I can reminded everyday that it truly is a daily War on art and being the person who I am destined and whom you are destined to be. This is better than the Celestine Prophecy in my opinion. You will LOVE this book if you are in need of a positive change in your life and is the ultimate &#34;Self Help&#34; book. Om Shanti.
B00C4XYEBW|2.0|I have not seen this video in its entirety but watched the one-hour show on MTV last night. Let me clarify up front that I am a huge Judas Priest fan. I have CDs, DVDs and have seen them live several times. However, if the rest of Epitaph follows what I saw last night, it is a disappointing end for the band. This was the last show of the tour and perhaps the band was tired on the night of the filming. It was sad to see Rob Halford mainly talking through songs instead of singing them. He appeared to strain on the most basic parts and often relied on the audience to sing them, an old trick that singers use when they can't perform.  This reached its nadir when he had the audience sing 'Breaking the Law'in its entirety! He didn't sing a note of it. Rob also looked like a tired old man at times. Having seen how he can energize a stage in the past, it is painful for me to write this. The one good thing was that the instruments were well recorded and the sound well balanced. Scott Travis, Ian Hill and Glen Tipton provided that typical Priest sound that fans all know and love. Richard Faulkner, who replaced K.K. Downing, is a talented guitarist but I found him to be rather annoying on stage. He was more intent on pointing at the audience and trying to get the spotlight on himself than in concentrating on playing. He at times seemed to play slightly out of synch with the rest of the band.  As a final concert and a purported goodbye from the band, although they stated they would still play select dates in the future instead of full tours, this did not live up to the quality of shows and music that Priest is capable of putting out. I was really looking forward to this release, but after what I saw last night, I doubt I will waste money on it. Maybe the Metal God needs to rest for a while, if not hang it up. I look forward to read what other Priest fans thought.
B005IF7HNA|5.0|I'd already seen Torchwood on Netflix and have been wanting to get it on DVD or blu ray for a while. Unfortunately both Doctor Who and Torchwood and frequently highly over prices. On top of that the Torchwood \\"box sets\\" would be missing either the Miracle Day or Children of Earth specials but be titles \\"the complete series\\".<br />So imagine my surprise when I see this on Amazon one day and it has all four series and specials included and for cheaper than what I'd have had to spend buying them individually or one box set and the one individual missing. Not to mention they are actually in a format that US players can actually read!!<br />When you get the box set it's awesome!! The series are in the same casing as if I'd purchased all off them separately. So it's defiantly a steal I you want to make the best out of your money and complete the series in one go!!<br />I'm so happy with my purchase and all of my discs work perfectly.
0399160450|4.0|I am a recent returnee to Clancy novels, not having read one since Red October was new. I was drawn to this by the theme of cyberwarfare and the Chinese threat aspect. I have long felt the Middle East is a distraction from the real concern, China. I also have also enjoyed the stand-alone Greaney novels. I found the novel intriguing and entertaining. Not a page turner that I had to read in an evening, but a good steady read that provided several evenings of entertaining and informative reading. I will acknowledge that as I closed in on the ending, I found it harder to put the book down. The character development was good. For not being familiar with the characters, enough background was given so that I could pickup on each one and felt I knew them pretty well by the end of the novel. The story moves along well, the scenes illustrated with sufficient detail to create a good image in my mind of the action going on, without drowning the reader in page after page of detail that you want to skip and get back to the storyline.<br /><br />I am sufficiently hooked into the believability of the characters that I plan to read \\"Locked On\\", the novel preceding this one.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I was very surprised at how original a British soap opera/sitcom/drama show could be.  This is has been fun to watch and refreshing against the usual primetime shows lineup.  The 3rd season is not quite as good as the first 2, but definitely still fun to watch.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|The weather map is all wrong, they should have terrain mapping.  The Weather Channel seems to overdo the forcast, making it sound worse than it is..............
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I never thought anyone would invent a calculator with me in mind. I deal with fractions on a daily basis, building doors, windows and furniture and I actually got pretty good at adding and subtracting fractions without a calculator but this gadget is PRICELESS. Besides calculating fractions it gives me the decimal equivalent when I am designing something on my computer.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I really love this game. I think anyone who doesn't have this game is missing out on all of the fun
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Good film love the Jurassic Trilogy. Kiddos have enjoyed the films and dinosaur figurine they have it on the shelf.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie is fabulous and refreshing.  I laughed, cried, rejoiced, believed and was emotionally moved every second of this film. The acting was superb and totally realistic. I would love to see more movies like this as it was refreshing to see a film about pure friendship and love.
0316228532|5.0|I have never actually read the book. But a friend of mine did, and she says that it was sad and stuff, but what J.K. Rowling was trying to portray is LIFE. News flash,not all books have unicorns ans rainbows and happy things as the theme. No, life does not either. And for all of you who are complaining about this not being the next Harry Potter, think about this. Would you give The Hunger Games a one star review just because it is not the next Gregor the Overlander? I don't think so. Seriously people. Think before you speak. Wow.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I loved this book for so many reasons<br /> For the literature references and the way books affected the Guernsey residents, for their compassion, their courage, their spirit and a better understanding of the events of the Occupation.  I loved the style in which it is written ; personal letters between friends. For me the language of the time with period references were delightful.  I mourned with the Society, I loved with the writer, I felt the pain of the Occupation and above all, I now feel that I am a member of this amazing society and will never forget these friends I have made along the way.

This is a fun little book that gives me something to do before bed each night. I was so excited when I finally completed an entire year.<br /><br />Some of the questions leave room for interpretation: \\"What kind of animal are you today?\\" and others are very straightforward: \\"What is the most expensive thing you're wearing right now\\". I like to bank up a few days at a time bc my life doesn't always allow answers for the questions asked on the correct days.<br /><br />Very happy to have found this gem of a journal!

B001K3ENEA|5.0|These headphones have saved my sanity asmy son uses them when practicing his guitar. He says that they are not bose but are a good deal for the price. We are both pleased with this purchase.
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|This movie was really cool. The only letdown is they didn't make a sequal! It's me of those sci-fi films I could watch over and over again!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|it is a good product and I like amazon product and will recommend to everyone I know and I rate this very highly
B000I8G5B2|4.0|Good movie! It has been a family favorite for years. We have always liked the underdog getting ahead type film. Add genetically enhanced humans and the idea a typical sick one can keep up and you have a really great movie!
B0091WR678|5.0|This is probably one of the best movies I have EVER seen! The cast was perfect. Story was amazing and mind twisting. The fact that the idea for this movie is so original keeps me wanting to watch it again every time!
B004UPANAI|4.0|The movie itself had an interesting story but it was a little too rushed in my opinion. The CG guys needed to spend a little more time on the graphics. Perfect example... In front of the mirror looking at his claws. Cartoonish!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|this is esily the best comic book movie ever made.  I highly recommend to any comic fans or even a non comic fan.  Intense action and a quality story line.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is a surprisingly addictive game. Though there are ads, they are small and non-intrusive. For a free game this is amazing.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Got all of the underworlds and it's great when you watch them all  with out commercials good movies. If you like these kind of movies you have to buy them all.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. It makes you think. I love it because anyone can play it. My 8 year old loves to play this.  I prefer it to so many of the mindless and violent games out there.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book engulfs the reader in a world far from imaginable in a fast-paced and exciting environment, with many twists and turns. Overall, one of the best books I've read.
0684874350|5.0|The book does read about a poor boy in Ireland. My sister and I was also brought up very poor here in the US. Even we did not have enough at the end of the week and was eating bread with a little bit of milk and sugar on it. If you haven't been poor this way, words can only tell the story. Great book, wish I could write to tell mine - and that it was an interesting.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This season is full of twists and turns.  So many surprises and issues to work through for the characters.  A bit hard to follow at some points, but very entertaining!!
B009K0P10K|4.0|Season 2 of Revenge has a slow start. As the plot thickens, new characters are introduced. It takes a while to figu out who is who. Still enjoyable and waiting for Emily to expose the bad guys!
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins' books are always page turners, and this is no exception.  They are not always realistic, but they are always entertaining.
B009NY43NY|1.0|Well, I bought and read the book and waited a few weeks to see if I calmed down... I have not! This is the most simplistic, \\"wrap it up\\" book I have ever read!! The ending was not a surprise... Charlaine had mentioned in an early interview that Eric was kind of an afterthought and she had decided her ending before Eric arrived in the series... so I had figured out early on that Eric was not going to be Sookie's fea. In the beginning I thought maybe she might develop a \\"thing\\" for Sam because she did an awful lot of lusting after him, but this sort of petered out. He hasn't been on her radar in quite a while. Lots of other candidates, but Sam just seemed to get left in the dirt! So I could have seen an ending with Sam, or maybe an unknown fae if there had been some sort of lead into it. But this was ridiculous. It is apparent that Charlaine was simply tired of this series and just decided, \\"what the hell\\" and wrapped it up as quickly and simply as possible. No lead up to Sookie starting to have feelings for Sam again... Just \\"POW\\"... Sam and Sookie, finally together after all these years. they've had so little interaction in previous books that this was absolutely insulting! And filling up pages (probably had a page requirement by her publisher) by just bringing in every previous character she could think of just left me feeling betrayed! Eric and Bill were major characters in this series and were simply passed over like insignificant, minor characters... Charlaine could have at least worked on them a bit to finish this book. This story could have actually been pleasant if not for the blatant unconcern and speed with which she finished the book. Charlaine has insulted her many loyal fans and diminished a truly fun and enjoyable series. Shame on you Charlaine! We, your fans, deserved better... and so did the characters in the Sookieverse! My recommendation... don't bother buying the book. It's a disappointment and Charlaine doesn't deserve any more money for this pathetic finale!!
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Outstanding movie. Since the story is based on a true historical event, this fact adds a whole new level of appreciation for those who devote themselves to protecting others. Extremely exciting movie that keeps you riveted to the TV all the way to its finish.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I've watched this movie now about 5 times with a variety of people. Everyone loves it. Cinematography makes Paris look extra sumptuous. Hemingway steals the show.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This book took a while to grow on me but I did enjoy it in the end.  I read the ending at least three times to insure I understood how the pieces fit together.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I love scary movies, and this one was pretty good, but the ending could have been better...but overall, a must see
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love anything to do with &#34;Bones&#34;.  I love the television series, however, this was the first book I'd actually read.  It threw me, somewhat, initially since Tempe's partner was not what I was expecting.  That did not deter me from the book, and I enjoyed it greatly.  It's a book I will read again and again.  I did notice that the character in the book is not quite as 'odd' as the one in the television series, which I like...she seems more human in the book.  Thank you for a book that I enjoyed the first time, and know I'll enjoy again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I cannot recommned this book enough.....if you like the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; this is even better, you will not be able to put it down!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had already seen the movie and enjoyed it and appreciated the casting of the lead characters.  My wife recommended the book for richer detail and development.  She was right.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Great. Couldn't be better. One of my favorite movies that will never get old. Everyone should fall in love with it all over again.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Very clever character-based story with excellent integration of some of the best nerd/geek games and entertainment. I was very entertained.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game you could get! Its for everyone, and I haven't met a friend of mine who doesn't play it! It has everything,  and you couldn't ask for more. This is the game to download!!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had never seen the pilot and so I totally enjoyed watching this!  No more words required by me, just this review....
1451695195|5.0|This is a very inspirational book.  I have always believed in the afterlife, but it is reassuring to see that this is yet another example of what I already know.  I just wish there was more time spent on his actual experience and not so much scientific/medical evaluation.  Maybe he will write another book as time goes by.  He may have a better insight of his experience.
B00338QENI|5.0|Skloot writes with grace, insight and technical adeptness.  She represents the scientists and medical practitioners, and the Henrietta Lacks family with sensitivity, compassion and understanding. I was surprised to learn anew more subtle ways that racism and classism discount individuals' humanity and destroy lives with impunity.  The book enhanced further my awareness of the diligence and persistence scientists and physicians bring to the task of curing disease and developing protocols that support those processes.  Rebecca Skloot is to be commended!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD.  Sometimes I get so tired of working out every single day, but it's not too hard to put this in, knowing it's gonna kick my butt, but it'll be over before 30 minutes is up.  I know it says it's a 20-minute workout, but it's got warm-up and cool-down, and a few itsy-bitsy breather breaks, so it ends up being ~26 minutes.  I'm always wiping sweat away before minute 10.  (And I'm in pretty decent shape already!)  There are 3 levels, and you can advance yourself as you feel the need to do so.  There's nothing saying you HAVE to do Level 1 for X days before going to Level 2.  I did Level 1 only 3-4 time before moving to Level 2.  I've been on Level 2 for nearly 2 weeks, and am just about ready to bump it up to Level 3.  This is a great workout, and I think it actually IS responsible for some of the inches I've been losing around my waist and hips.  Excellent!!!  Highly, highly recommend this workout.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?  The gang is awesome, and I'm so glad to have the next season on DVD.  This review isn't helpful, but if you really have no clue about TBBT, then what are you doing looking at a Season Five review?  Go back to Season One, and learn what you have been missing!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|well done, great acting by both stars and enjoyable to watch.  not suitable for young children though  has some swears and bad behavior
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Keeps you wanting to start the next chapter!  And also answers questions from some of the books I've read that were written After this one.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|The trailers showed this to be more entertaining than it truly was.  I'm a Mark Walberg fan, but this was bad.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I currently play this on my laptop and the purchase of my Kindle Fire provided that mobile ability I wanted.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I read The Giver along with Lois Lowrey's other two books in the set when I was in middle school and fell in love. I had to re read this and the others once I discovered that there is now a fourth! Lois' books helped shape me into who I am today.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|It was well written. Abook about &#34;children&#34; teaching adult values to be remembered. Adults learn from results. Children produce results.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderful.  I have been waiting a longtime for Mr Hosseini to write another book.  Through his descriptive, rich narrative in each of his three books, he has gifted me with the feeling of having been to Kabul, and to imagine the beauty of his homeland.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The movie is accurate in detail for the dvd as it was when it was on video and in theaters.
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game. I love it. Just wish the splats would stay longer hahaha. Really like this I am sure anyone else will also..
B0091REZMW|1.0|It was not what I wanted. Some may like it but I just didn't find anything to keep my interest. Maybe it's more for children I didn't read the description too good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It has really difficult levels that are challenging and exciting.  My son loves the creative side of being able build anything he wants.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|My boys like this game because it has more action than Temple Run.  More options and more powers.  Colorful graphics.  Lots of fun levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a very good game, ive seen the xbox and pc version, not as good but really good for a portable game- it doea although need updates and mods very good- its worth the $$
B000HF6XKO|5.0|Very Entertaining movie, would definitely watch again.  Easy to follow along with the plot which takes several twists and turns for mystery.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|It's been some time since I've read a book that I didn't want to put down. The story moves along quickly enough that I don't get bored. It's well written and short. It's really good!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I am grateful to live in a world that would make this movie!  I can't wait to watch this over and over again because I know this is one of those movies that will keep inspiring!
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|I want a refund, I bought it for rent and went to download and it started the 48 hour time but it wouldn't download it kept saying \\" sorry try again\\". It was so frustrating I would try to download it at least 12 times that day and it wouldn't download so the rent was up a and I didn't even get to watch the movie. I'm so pissed. I deserve a refund.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|super cool game if you like iron man its easy at first but gets harder  it has alot of action and you have misions
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is one of the better<br /> games Ive bought, the only problem I had so far was sometimes my buildings won't come up.  Other than that it's my favorite game on the Appstore.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|When I started to read this book I was immediately intrigued. I knew I was going to learn something vital about myself, Weller like FELT.<br />It was a great read and I look forward to reading it again
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game! Once I start playing I can't stop. It's so addicting. Fun game for adults and children. Enjoy!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|i have cut 4 bottles now, 2 came out perfect, 2 did not. the hardest thing is putting the cutter together, after you put it together, your home free.easy to use.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|This is an unusual story of a young Irish girl who arrives in post-Revolutionary War America as an indentured servant.  She finds herself in the kitchen house of a Virginia plantation in the care of the house slaves.  I found it a unique  situation and it could have been a compelling novel. However, I found the narrative to be rushed and confusing at times, which made it difficult to follow. I think other reviewers stated it best; the author should have \\"shown the reader vs. telling the reader.\\"<br /><br />As an avid reader of historical fiction, this is not a period of time used as the setting of many books. I would have loved to have more of the contemporary concerns of the day included as a backdrop to give the reader a better sense of time and place (beyond the concept of indentured servitude).  Because really this book could have been set in 1790 or 1830 and it wouldn't have been much different.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really like this game. I hope it continues to be as exceptional as your other games, like Ice Age, which I've been playing for ever.
B00785P2QC|4.0|realistic stimulating and realistic game.  should be able to obtain city money faster.  I also play same game on Ipad.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|It is rare that one reads a book able to convey the tragic complexity and contradictory character of humans. Too much violence and praise of masculinity but then that is a part of life or of some, many lives and this book gives us a better bad deeper understanding of this kind of masculinity than any ethnographic study.
0714864803|5.0|Broad range of recipes - from vegan to vegetarian to meat-centric, quick-pull-it-together-from-the-pantry to group/party-favorite - you really can't go wrong with this cookbook. I also give it as a gift to health conscious or foodie friends. I can't say enough positive things about this cookbook.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|An amazing book.  Enjoyed the look back in time.  Makes you rethink wanting to go back in your life to do things differently.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I've enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse series a lot - even more than the TV series. But this book and the one before it as well just don't match up to the previous books in the series.  I know a lot of people didn't like that Sookie didn't end up with Bill or Eric; I don't have a dog in that fight (pardon the pun). But the Sookie/Sam match felt too forced, too contrived.  It just really felt as though Ms. Harris lost interest, that her heart wasn't in it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Astute and accessible... Wherever you fall on the personality spectrum, your understanding of colleagues, friends, and family will be greatly improved after reading Cain's insightful work.
0679731725|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed reading this book as I think I've read everything else Ishiguro has published, but somehow I did.  But what a pleasure to have had this book still unread, a little treasure still awaiting me.  I just finished it yesterday, and Ishiguro amazed me again.<br /><br />In many ways this book reminded me more of [[ASIN:B009CROY7M Never Let Me Go]] than his other works. Here, as in Never Let Me Go, Ishiguro lets us see the limitations of his characters' view at the same time that he makes us wrestle with complex ethical questions.  And, although perhaps darker and more brooding in Never Let Me Go, his writing in Remains of the Day has the same quiet, measured quality that allows the landscape and buildings to take on almost as much presence as his characters; and in this book, where the main character's occupation requires a studied lack of presence, this was particularly powerful.
159463176X|5.0|After reading his first two books, I have been waiting for a third and was not disappointed.  This is a beautiful story and I found myself in tears more than once. Mr. Hosseini is  a gifted writer.  I know I will read this book again and love it just as much the second time!
B000RH0C8G|5.0|While this may be the most famous Michael Lewis book, it isn't his best in my opinion...but it is very good and quite a worthwhile read. Read it and then see the movie. Easy read...very entertaining and interesting.
B009NY43NY|5.0|A wonderful way to tie up loose endings for Happy Ever After! I didn't know this is how I wanted it to end until I got to the ending! Thank you!
B004289ZW0|1.0|Don't buy this garbage. Bad quality case and reset button will be broken sooner or later.<br />Buy rather Garmin receiver.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|History well told through a leader and his family life. Episodes in a season are TOO short, cannot get enough.
0786868724|5.0|Love this book, came quickly and was used so it made the reading experience even better but book was still in great condition.
B001H9JBW6|3.0|My wife's infatuation with Benedict Cumberbatch continues unabated, so I was invited to watch five hours of this nonsense with her and, well, it was that or divorce, what would you do?  While it was going on she admitted that even Cumberbatch, the single greatest man who ever lived in all of history she thinks, was finding it heavy going breathing life into this story which we had both seen, like, one million times.  Anyone who has watched Tom Cruise in a futuristic movie has seen it, and seen it done much better.  I hereby give Tom Cruise a Bell Curve Oscar for his sterling work in Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, War of the Worlds, etc.  Lifetime Achievement Award, and it will be presented live on TV to him by Rosie O'Donnell and a deflated Benedict Cumberbatch.<br /><br />The story is ridiculously expanded to pad out two hours to five.  My questions include, Who are those evil foreign brothers from Russia or wherever?  Who is Robert Carlyle playing and how does he know so much, and yet so little, about every twist and turn of the plot?  Is every government employee in England satanically evil?  If you were a woman passionately devoted to your husband, and he died, and his brother showed up the day of his funeral, a brother you had never met and moreover looks nothing like your husband--we were 100 per cent sure it would turn out that he actually was the husband, with a facelift and his memory shifted as in Total Recall or Source Code--would you skip the funeral and have sex with this stranger instead?  While a plague stricken woman lies dying in the next room, a woman you are sworn to help?  (This is no spoiler as it occurs within the first 25 minutes of the miniseries.)  My wife murmured, \\"Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't help himself, but that woman Kasim is a slut.\\"  Later she apologizes by explaining that, \\"He was there.... And I wanted him,\\" a sentiment my wife sympathized with.  OK, more questions, Carrie's boss in Homeland, David Estes, shows up in this effort playing the exact same part, only here he's British.  Does he play no other sort of role?  It is the sort of part Rod Steiger and then John Malkovich used to excel in, cold as ice and pure and icy ambition.<br /><br />Then there's the Robert Carlyle question.  It seems like only yesterday he used to be a great star, in The Full Monty and Trainspotting and others.  Surprised to see him still alive, and unable to follow a single word of his dialogue due to my accent recognition software malfunctioning, I spent a lot of time looking him up simultaneously on IMDB and finding out that in fact he's been busy acting in thirty-two movies I have never heard of, sometimes playing characters such as \\"Third Man in Tavern\\" or \\"Chauffeur.\\"  I guess he saw he had a lead part in a miniseries and jumped in with both feet, but the cruel producers here made him leave off his lifts, so he tries his best to menace and murder and hold hostage, but it's cute because he's no more than five feet three I would estimate.  It's like watching little Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense as a supervillain, in punky clothes borrowed from, oh I don't know, Punky Brewster.<br /><br />Final question, have you ever seen a tacked-on ending before?  Of course you have, but this one will leave you with your head in your hands, mumbling and pouting, one thought ratcheting through your brain, that soon, very soon, your wife is going to be forcing you to see Benedict Cumberbatch in the forthcoming biopic of Julian Assange (!!!) and she'll be whispering in your ear, \\"Oh be a sport, at least it will be better than The Last Enemy.\\"the exact same part, only here he's British.

B004ZN9RWK|5.0|We've not had a Pink Floyd album or CD before buying this disc.  Their song, Us and Them, caught our ear one day while riding in the car.  Got home and did some computer research and found a You Tube of Pink Floyd performing that song.  After reading some information on the group and previewing the CD, we bought it!  Have a younger sister-in-law who now laughingly calls us &#34;stoners&#34;!!!!  Great music!
B007RRFUHM|5.0|Not your typical run of the mill British artist. Vows has a very distinct sound that's executed flawlessly. My only beef with the album is the bonus tracks, which sound like typical American pop garbage. Hopefully, she doesn't trend in that direction.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I had been waiting years to see the movie in the quality that Blu-Ray and now the time comes, it is certainly something that leaves you with your mouth open

6305428042|5.0|I love this movie.  A real fantasy about tales of olde come true on the screen.  It's a movie for all kids from 5 to 99.  I never get tired of watching it, especially at Halloween time.

0385349947|5.0|What I heard about this book before I read it was the controversy. After reading it all I can do is shake my head at what passes for &#34;controversial&#34; when it comes to women and work. Although she has been chided by some for not taking sufficient account of the fact that her situation is one of privilege, she repeatedly acknowledges this in the book. She says explicitly that some of her advice will not work for women who have lower ranking jobs or who earn far less money. She has also been accused of subtly or not so subtly suggesting that equality for women is all about women &#34;leaning in&#34; and dismissing the importance of law and other structural, social change in the fight for women's equality. this is not the case however. Sandberg explicitly acknowledges the importance of the women's movement, of law of structural changes in brining about equality for women. Sandberg was also accused of privileging work above family, but anyone who says this clearly hasn't read the book. She bends over backward to recognize that being a stay-at-home parent is a &#34;job&#34; worthy or equal respect and recognition. She also tries to make sure that she recognizes that single women without children or women who are single mothers or any other permutation of family has its own imperatives and that women ultimately have to do what seems right for them. Indeed she works so hard to be inclusive that it almost negates the message - that women need to have more representation at the top of all professions, in the boardrooms, in government, in leadership roles and that women can benefit from being reflective about they ways in which they may be inadvertently contributing to failing to achieve their goals; that men need to play a greater role in sharing child-rearing and household tasks; that government and companies need to adopt more family friendly and gender neutral policies with respect to family leave so that children don't continue to be seen as &#34;women's work.&#34;<br /><br />Ultimately these messages come across and and they do so with charm and wit. There is a lot here for everyone - men and women alike - to reflect on. Sandburg is most definitely not blaming women for the gender discrimination in the workplace. Indeed, one of the most valuable parts of the book is her frank warning that women who take her advice and &#34;lean in,&#34; ask for a seat at the table, speak up and speak their own truths, won't always be rewarded for it because all of these things can be more threatening to those who want to see women remain marginalized. Sometimes you will be punished for these things. Sandberg's point is, however, that these things are a necessary predicate to real advancement and that playing it safe may mean keeping your job but it will rarely mean advancement. She is clear that speaking up may have a price. She acknowledges that not everyone will be able to use some of this advice, or won't be able to use it in every situation. Still, these are insights that I think many young women need.<br /><br />As a law professor I see a number of young women who seem all too ready to abandon the substantial investment they have made in their legal education in favor of being a stay-at-home mom. Many of them are very young and I worry that when they get older they will regret putting their careers so far on the back burner and rendering themselves so dependent on their husbands for economic support. Law school is a big investment of time and money. I want to see my students get the benefit of that investment.<br /><br /> I heartily recommend this book to any young person starting a career today, especially young women.

B00AEBB8YW|4.0|This is a great love story about a dream come true in a way not imagined. Worth the money spent.
B003E20ZQA|5.0|I loved this, absolutely, it has an ability to transport you back to the era it was written in and make it feel immediate and up to date.  It's beautiful and  touching and gritty and funny and sad.  It makes you feel that the only thing worth living for is art.  Patti Smith must be a genius.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great amount of room and compartments for all of my lens and cleaning supplies. The zippers, exterior straps and pouches all looked sturdy enough and it opens up easy. Good deal amazon.
1400052181|4.0|There are many issues in this book that will make you stop and think.  Incest, Black/White relations, 60 years of Liberal Politics and Policy, Black Culture, and of course Human cells and tissue will all make you stop and think before you continue with the next chapter.  The author did a terrific job of telling the story without influencing the readers opinion throughout the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Challenging but not frustrating. Visually beautiful game that is utterly addicting.  Looking forward to other games of this ilk from this company and hope that future games are longer play time.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|This set captures the vitality and quality of the 2012 \\"reunion\\" tour, which many of us were privileged to see. Yes, a superb supporting cast rounded out the Boys' stage product; but the Boys themselves shined, all captured in this recording. We probably each wish the selection of material from the concerts was longer, or different (e. g. why not \\"Kiss Me Baby\\" ?); but we can't fairly be disappointed with this fine album. Like last year's tour and the extraordinary quality of it, it is a blessing, and an affirmation of an extraordinary legacy.    Some of us may let the disappointment felt when the reunited Beach Boys did not remain together influence their reaction to this album. I understand, because I feel that disappointment. The absence of any commentary or liner notes to this collection silently expresses the awkwardness of the situation. For such friends I share my thoughts on that subject: Many fans have bashed Mike for refusing the overtures from Al and Brian as the success and energy of 2012 grew, and instead leaving them behind to drive on with his roadshow. Though Mike's band passes through my area often, I've never seen it. I haven't shunned it, exactly; but I haven't been inspired to see it. Mike has always been a unique stage character, and an acquired taste. By contrast, I have seen Brian on tour, and I have most of his solo music; and I have Al's \\"Family and Friends\\" CD. But,to be fair to Mike, the fact is that Al didn't have the heart to continue touring after Carl's death. Mike had another vision. Mike purchased the right to continue touring as the Beach Boys from Brian, from Al, and from Carl's estate. They didn't have to sell; they sold to Mike with the knowledge that for the first time, the touring band and the Beach Boys would truly, legally be two different things. Obviously neither Brian nor Al expected the surviving Boys would ever coalesce again - who imagined it? Even before Carl's death, the band had long since ceased making new music, with occasional awful exceptions. Mike found Bruce, brought David on board for awhile, assembled other fine musicians, and constructed an excellent touring band at his risk and expense. As we all know, Mike has been on the road year in, year out. Mike credits himself for keeping the Beach Boys name and some of its music in the public ear, and he may be right. If Mike had not been plugging the brand all over the place for all the years between Carl's death and the 50th, would the Beach Boys have still been the household name in Rock & Roll that they were when the 50th came around? The honest answer is, probably not.   Many of us hoped that the Beach Boys would regroup once both Al and a revitalized Brian unexpectedly expressed that wish; we imagined a final great album to round out the band's legacy. But Mike has been going it alone for many years, and he must have wondered how long, and for what, Al and Brian were really in for; what his place in a \\"new\\" group would be; and whether he should change his life and the lives of his band members to accommodate whatever might come. Also, lets face it, Mike enjoys being in command, and if he is tied up with Al and Brian again, he really would not be, whatever the legalities. From the outside looking in, it seems sadly mistaken for Mike, age 72, to spurn the opportunity to conclude his career on top, as an artist, contributing to new music of potentially extraordinary quality. But if the Beach Boys story ends with the 2012 album, and these concerts, as it seems it has, lets not let ourselves be disappointed - instead, lets be grateful. We had no reason to expect we'd hear the Boys together ever again, and once they jelled, the concerts were simply fabulous, a tribute to and by this singularly great band, and a reaffirmation of its legacy in American and rock music.
0679805273|3.0|I bought this book listed &#34;new&#34; and it was definitely not new.  Someone's name was written in the inside cover.  I was very disappointed as we were using the book's for my husband's graduation party from college as a guest book.  We still used it because we didn't have time to get an actually new book, but it is annoying to have someone else's name written in the book!
B00821OX98|5.0|I loved the show. I am glad that it is still available. I was worried that it would be canceled before...
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This is a good movie to watch with the kids as it is enjoyable for the adults as well, making it a good choice for family movie night.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|This documentary takes a snapshot on the life of Ayrton Senna, his struggle with the French FIA president and with his team mate and hero Alain Prost. Probably the first driver who took the sport as it was, a sport... Anyone can really immerse in what F1 really is and who this kid was with just watching this film.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|very very full of color and addictive ..... keep running out of lives. so sad that I keep running out of lives
B004QXJZXA|5.0|Back in 1971 this movie passed almost with put notice: nobody cared or nobody was interested. Today over 42 years later the film has become a real racing document to be enjoyed. The real experience of the sport prototype cars racing thru the track/street for 24 hours, and the struggle of the drivers... this is about racing.
0061900656|5.0|This book was great for helping my 3 year old to understand some of the changes that were headed his way.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|The project Frankenheimer beat Steve McQueen when both bid for it in the 1960's is probably the best Formula 1 project ever, and I doubt this will remain to be this way for a long time. The biggest and most expensive and exclusive sport on the planet can't be easily taken into a movie, perhaps the old 60's were the only possible time to do so. The performance of every actor, and the production with never seen before shots makes it an amazing film.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|For any fan of the movie Avatar, this is a great buy. It was timely shipped and in perfect condition when I got it. I'd recommend this to any fan :)
B00CW665VI|5.0|When you begin to read this book be prepared for a fun and sweet read that you won't want to put down. The point of view of this book is creative and humorous- since it's from the male perspective throughout with all the craziness only a male can put out there. The story is cute but it is the development of Drew and the nutty male humor that makes this book so special. How he goes about to get something that he can't have (Kate) is funny and sweet. It was great to have a few strong women characters - his sister, his niece (she's only 4 but funny), Delores and of course Kate who didn't melt after Drew but made him work for something special - her. Loved the money jar!  LOL Hope there is a book 2 to see where their love goes.  Loved this fun read. If you read it out in public (pool, park, beach) watch your laughing!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can I say to a novel well written.  I could not put it down. E L James u out did yourself again.  Enjoyed the book.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The strap is slightly rough at the cut end, but for the money, this watch is an amazing value and I love it
B004JMZPJG|3.0|I purchased this as a larger version of the DCB-304 which is an excellent case.  Not this case!  It does have side pockets, but not the nice web pocket inside to hold things in when unzipped.  Also, it does not have the inside zipped pocket at the lid.  A case of this size should have these features and add to this velcro dividers for tightly holding the camera in place and placing items outside the camera area, for miscellaneous items.  I returned this item which is described as a &#34;holster&#34;, pay attention to this description.  Amazon promptly refunded my payment.  I did buy another Caselogic DCB-307, which is much larger and has dividers and webbing for another purpose.  A case just a little larger than the DCB-304 would be useful for a digital &#34;bridge/superzoom camera&#34; and it's charger.  Still really looking for something for this purpose.  The&#34;holster&#34; DCB-306 is too big and about as useful for carrying a camera as a bucket.  I amend my review, as I re-bought it locally because I purchased a large super-zoom, a Fuji Finepix HS50EXR and it is the right size for this camera and the charger with spare batteries.  I still lament that the case has no webbing inside the side pockets, but it is the best choice of all other cases I looked at for this camera.  So, go ahead, If you have a larger camera it will work.
B000UD08HW|5.0|I have always loved Pink Floyed music and a great fan, David Gilmour (lead vocalist and lead guitarist of Pink Floyed) is with with out a doubt the greatest guitarist I have ever seen, and this live concert is the prof , The quality of this blue ray is wonderful, its just like being there. I have had this video for about 5 years now, and its still rates as one of my best music videos that I have. I have seen a lot of David Gilmour live concerts, but this one at the Royal Albert is with out the best, and its truly amazing watching David play all the classic music that has changed the world of music, inspired generations. This video is a must see for any music fan, watching a genius at work.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Just as good as 1st book. Ending is awesome...can't wait to read the next book. The Capitol needs to be taken down. What a horrible way of making them pay for a revolt years before...it's not enough that they starve them to death....
B000AP04FG|5.0|Who doesn't love this duo.  They really show their ease with each other.  GREAT flick!!!  Own it and watch it over and over again, picking up things I didn't see the first time.  Funny, thrilling!  LOVE THIS!  Easy from order to arrival!
1400052181|5.0|This is a wonderful book club choice.  There is so much fodder for thought---medical ethics then and now, health care delivery to the indigent, black migration from the south.  And the writing is compelling.  Great book.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|Book was gripping from beginning to end - did not want to put down.<br />Great character development<br />Jumping back and forwards in-time - required careful concentration

B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I had thought that I had seen the end of the Rebus series. I have all the others in hard back. I read the whole book on the flight between London and Melbourne.<br /> Classic crime novel.Gripping plot. Well up to the standard of the other Rebus novels.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I can't complain about this game.  It's free with ads, but it's not as if those ads interfere at all with the game players.  The game is very easy to get.  Just takes a bit of patience in some parts to beat your high score.  All in all I would pay .99 for this game.  It's great to play to pass the time in the car or at the Dr 's office.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best I can't wait till buckets come out<br />You build houses and mine for materials I also can't wait for Redstone

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is amazing. No book can compare. It really changes your view on certain subjects addressed in the book. I love this book so much. A must read.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Not nearly as good as the first two Clifton chronicles. and still no real ending.  Far Too political and rather confusing at times
B00CW665VI|5.0|MBF: Me before flu<br /><br />This story was written form Drew's POV.  Emma Chase did an excellent job of thinking like a man. This book is brilliant and if you didn't know better, you would think a male wrote it. This book is hilarious, erotic, and well written. Kudos to Emma Chase on Tangled. I have become an instant fan.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|I really enjoyed &#34;the unlikely pilgrimage of Harold Fry&#34;  Most of all, the development of the characters, the positivity and message of love and hope
B0064QNS62|1.0|I really didn't care for this game. Thought it was like a mario bros and it isn't. I don't really care for it at all, thinking of deleting it from my library,.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love loved this game its challenging and at thesamr time fun k so if u don't have it better hurry and get it so fun omg
B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|This album presents a completely different side of Daft Punk.  Given their significant influence across all forms of music today, I wonder (hope?) that this is a sign of future trends in pop & electronic music.<br /><br />There are some absolutely perfect songs on this album, and the package as a whole is very good.  I can't give it 5 stars though because there are about 3 tracks that bring it down a notch.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I didn't like the book but some if it I did if u have to rate I gave it a 1
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This is a great case! Definitely a great purchase. The only this I didn't really like is the touch screen takes lots more effort compared to my otter box. Otherwise, perfect:)
B0041C1ZXE|5.0|The title says it all, the album itself is great, and the instant download of the music was nice too. Delivery was prompt and the packaging seemed to protect the vinyl well.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Great seeing Arnold back. A little disconcerting how much he has aged sine his sabatical into politics but nevertheless. This is standard 90's action fare very dated for today's audiences. This is a weak script with weak cliched dialogue and \\"plot\\". Wish Arnold had swung for the fences on his comeback but I get the feeling this film was nothing more than him testing the waters. Here is hoping that his next few, which I understand are already in the can, are better than this and we can see him in this a little less predictable. Anyone other than Arnold and this would have gone straight to video.
0143123173|5.0|I received this book for Christmas.  I'm a fan of the \\"Longmire\\" TV series and since I'd watched it I wasn't in a hurry to read the book because I figured it'd just be a repeat of what I'd already seen on TV.  Silly me.  I should know better by now that books are usually better than any show they're made into-no matter how good that show may be.<br /><br />I wish I'd read the book sooner.  It's absolutely great! It's one of those books that's so much more than a mystery or a western.  Walt and his buddy Henry made me chuckle more than once.  What a couple of characters! I could go on praising it, but instead I'm going to go pick up the next book in the series and read it.  You'll have to read the book to fully understand what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Mr. Johnson is one of the truly great writers out there.  He kept me entertained from start to finish and I'm even more of a fan of the series than I was.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This is a very interesting book to read for the people who like mystery. It also adventurous in this book
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|Like the other reviews, this RAM is working great in my NAS.  I didn't measure the time to complete some big tasks, but my memory usage is much lower, and not riding up to 80% anymore when doing multiple Backups and virus scanning.  My gut feel is tasks are finishing sooner.  The RAM was very easy to install, just a bunch of screws and sliding off the case.  I would definitely recommend the upgrade.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am having a great time trying to solve this mystery. I hope that the next game will be as much fun as this one was.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|I really enjoyed this album. I liked his second album a little bit more.<br />Mostly upbeat songs, but I like it most because one of my wedding songs is on it!
B00271HAK8|5.0|Great oldie but goodie movie love ferris!!! Bueller... Bueller can't get enough. Watched 100 times and will totally watch 100 times more
B001AMNL2Q|4.0|Having experienced the Viet Nam war first hand this movie, like Platoon and others, rang very true and brought back many memories both good and bad, but very real. It shows the many types of characters and personalities you encounter when thrust into that kind of environment.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Totally love the book movie grew on me now I love it too will watch 100 more times for sure
B0071XO8RA|5.0|....if we came close to destroying our planet.  The characters are interesting.  It is easy to get wrapped up in their story, to want to know how it all ends.  Good guys struggle to make sense of their world.  Bad guys try to maintain the status quo at any cost.  What is real?  Why are things the way they are?  What can be done to make life better?  Read this story and find out.  I really enjoyed this story and would recommend it to others.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Cute movie I thought it was a good family movie may have to buy it will definitely watch again thanks
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has established himself as one of the great writers of our time. In this novel, his writing takes a slightly different tone, that of a storyteller and the result is masterful. The story starts in Afghanistan and makes it way around the world as his characters mature and multiply.  But the initial portrait of life in Afghanistan is so riveting that it reaches right down into your soul. This is not a political book - it is a book about the human condition, of love and hate, indebtedness and survival. He has some of the most beautiful and terrifying things to say about the surprises of aging, and these are universal truths. They are as pertinent in Europe or South America or Brooklyn, New York. And this is what makes Hosseini so great, that even if his base is Afghanistan, his reach is as far as the human heart. Someone, something, some event, some emotion, some greater truth will resonate with anyone who has the good fortune to read this masterwork. Long after the reading is done, the heart will remember!
B001GUXJQA|4.0|It was an enjoyable read.-- Interesting twists to the plot line.--it was a  really good buy and a fast read
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We enjoy the tv series even more than th books. Great acting and visual effects. If you enjoy epic adventure this is highly recommended.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Really enjoyed this book. It haunts you later. It leaves you guessing. Wonderful character and plot development. Highly, highly recommend.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It ok to use but since it only faces me and not outward...I find it only ok great HD quality.
B00BGIBVRG|1.0|A rambling schizophrenic movie with very few redeeming moments.  I would hardly classify it as a comedy.  Really disappointed I spent the money to rent it!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|So I dont have to beat my alarm clock any more, now that I am caught with my Kindle.  Great to have all the settings on this clock and faces.  The option for alarms are wonderful and melodic to my ear in the mornings.  Great app when I travel and have a steady alarm I can depend on.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I never miss this show.It has so many twists  and turns,you don't know what is coming next-hate to see the season end!
B003WE9TU8|5.0|I enjoyed this book, a clever take on the undead. We be good to read Max's take from the Zombie side.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I wasn't crazy about Gone Girl, but I still thought I'd give Sharp Objects a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I was hooked from the start.  It's interesting to see how a mother's actions affect her three daughters.  Although I could pretty much figure out the ending halfway through the book, I still enjoyed reading through the end of the story.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys crime novels.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Bazooka or automatic 50 caliber foot soldiers .other wise very well put together. I am very glad someone had the forethought to hold the costs of land at a reasonable amount of coins and not increase too much. The combat in PvP I thought was excellent though some players don't know when to quit when they are beaten.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|This was the first book that I read that was set in Africa and I enjoyed it thoroughly!! Adichie does a great job of painting each scene so that the reader can visualize what is going on. I wasn't ready for the book to end because I wanted more!!! Would definitely like to see more from this author about this family!!
B00B0A5XQU|5.0|Debbie always comes through using humor, real life situations that need resolved and Godly source for help.  Her books are clean, wholesome and enjoyable.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|After playing through the game (with much frustration when I had to stop playing and could not pause and my person died...), I emailed the developer, requesting a pause feature. Much to my surprise, I got a quick reply informing me that to pause the game, all you have to do is press the back button. I never would have thought of that in a million years, but it makes playing the game SO much easier!<br /><br />The game itself is fun, has a retro feel, and made me a bit nostalgic for my childhood. (I'm 30-something).<br /><br />I really enjoyed the gameplay, the objectives in each level were fun to meet, and the various tips that appeared when retrying a level after you failed definitely made playing the game easier.<br /><br />It is nice that you can continue to play this game after you escape (win), but would be nice if the developer would add some extra objectives so that continuing the gameplay has a challenge. (I've already emailed the developer to suggest this.)<br /><br />I feel bad getting this as the FAOTD, as I would gladly pay the $2 for the amount of enjoyment it has given me.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|The love story between Heathcliff and Catherine is eternal like that of Romeo and Juliette; the thing I really dislike is the animal cruelty, and hope that Bronte' was not like that but was describing the mores of some people at that time. If people had the guts to talk to each other as Catherine and Heathcliff should have done, their love story would have been one of the better ones in literature.
B00846WWVM|2.0|This game had controls that were difficult to use. I found myself losing levels because I could not move the water to the correct place quickly enough. Something more intuitive, with less motions needed, would make the game much better.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|Been a fan since early seventies when a friend loaned me The Stand. I have every book, including the red leather bound that's been discontinued. Two of them The Stand  and Insomnia are personally autographed.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great graphics. Fast paced. Lots of fun to play. No glitches issues.  Does not require you to have Internet access to play game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great game I play all the time. It was free and I makes your brain think. Not complicated like some of the other games.

B00BK40QO0|5.0|These recordings have all been previously re-released on cd numerous times so the question here is how much better are the new remasterings (2011/2012)? I would say they are marginally better in most cases. What is interesting here is that EMI France released an almost identical set of Klemperer's Mahler in 2011. That set was supposedly remastered in 2011, and I wonder if some of these same remasterings have been included in the set currently under discussion. In any case, most of the recordings in this newer set are great and in some cases definitive (I have always particularly enjoyed Klemperer's Mahler 9 despite some heavy-handed conducting in the middle movements). Speaking of heavy-handed conducting, one could safely say that the Mahler 7 contained here represents one of the most extreme examples of Klemperer's penchant for slow tempi in his older age. Some people find this view too extreme to be acceptable. While definitely not the only Mahler 7 one should own, I do find Klemperer's view to be an interesting exercise in slowness that reveals more detail in the score than is usually heard. As is fairly well-known, Klemperer was present at the rehearsals and world premiere of this symphony, and I have also read that Mahler's tempi in this premiere were somewhat slower than what we are accustomed to nowadays. Each listener will have to make up his or her own mind about this controversial performance, but I for one enjoy hearing it from time to time. All in all, this release should be acquired if one doesn't already have these performances, and the price is also unbeatable.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|So much better than the movie.  I loved the suspense and the romance that was in intertwined into the storyline.
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|The game is fun to play but the app is not well created. It crashes and can't be repaired without losing everything you have earned.!
038533348X|5.0|As a Bokononist, this book is quite literally my bible. It is also &#34;laugh out loud&#34; funny. Man, I miss Kurt Vonnegut!
B008EKOIN8|4.0|Pollan uses barbecue, bread, beer, kimchee, and stews to write some very interesting things about food.  Fast food, factory farming and marketing, and eating alone are his targets.  His goal is more food prepared and shared by its consumers.  Food is more than fuel.  It is also a necessary tool for social intercourse.  The health of our bodies and our culture will improve if we follow his recipes.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Watched the season already. I got my husband interested in the show also. Can't wait for season 3.  Excellent condition of DVD set.
0486424510|4.0|I found the mystery itself well designed, though eventually predictable. What I enjoyed most about this book was the way Wilkie Collins wrote from various perspectives, particularly those of aging servant Betteredge early on and altruistic Jennings toward the end. A fun read.
B00BOUL9DM|3.0|this is a fun game to play with the grandiose. I agree with another poster who said there should be a hive jp button though.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|could be faster. great for reading books.  no need to get rid of books or keep. 'm out  of thought now
B009O07NMA|5.0|I love almost every song! great. Upbeat! Dancing around the kitchen!!! makes you smile and feel great! Was so happy to find it! Have been listening to more Country music.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Downloaded quick and easy and installed with no problems. runs on my Fire great and makes facebook that much easier to use.
B00005N6KG|5.0|If the newest earbuds hurt your ears, these are for you.  They slide right in without any pain and the sound is terrific!  No soreness to the ears and they don't fall out.  You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this app because, the horses look so real and you have to work to level! Lots of stuff you can do with your horse on this app, i rate it a 5 out of 5!!!
B0059XTV7Q|1.0|This was probably the worst movie I've seen in the past few years. Don't let the fact that Madonna was involved fool you. I was originally interested because it was based on a real story (docudrama). I have an open mind so I decided to suffer through it; I was bored very quickly and disappointed overall.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Got this to show my kids that the great stories are timeless - and the TV shows actually pay homage to the books!
0452289963|5.0|After reading a few of Eckhart Tolle's books, I referred my friends. For some of my friends having difficulty (i.e. divorce), they felt this book helped them through it - made it all more tolerable. I highly recommend this book!!
0689835604|5.0|This is a very cute book; bright colors abound and words are fluid enough that when reading to a baby, one can be interactive. It's fun to read to the grandbaby.. I heartily recommend this.
B00ABOU794|4.0|Love the TV show so had to get the soundtrack. A mix of good and not so good songs but worth the money!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I just started playing! it's really cool! It takes a little bit to get used to the controlls! The graphics  are really awesome!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Saw it at the movies and it's one of those films worth buying. Great collections of superheroes and stars. Worth watching and buying.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This game is awesome in board or app version. It can get a little different than how I've been playing, so it mixes things up. The games go quick, so it's the perfect time killer when you have a few minutes wait.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish I could get this game. it was on sale last week but I missed it. I thought it was going to be on sale on memorial day
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|After reading several of Diana Gabaldon's books, I'm amazed how intriguing this one is. I keep expecting things to become predictable or repetitive, but not so far. I enjoy her characters and the little surprises she throws in. I've already ordered the next one in the series.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|already found a use for it will use for everything it's super easy to use and easy to understand thanks
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is Cher at her best! I have never considered Cher much of an actress. But how wrong I was! She was simply marvelous and a real treat to watch in this tantalizing movie. I highly recommend this for a light hearted fun movie! A great diversion from all the unsettling world problems!!! A must for any home movie library!!!
B003VS0CXS|4.0|Beautiful picture and great detail. Colors pop and is candy for the eyes. Great movies for kids. Glad I purchased this blu ray.
1451648537|5.0|This was a most fascination read about how and what made this most creative msn 'tick'. The width of the book scared me so I opted for the tapes. And yes, it was 26 and s half hours long. Not only was it the life if Steve Jobs, it was the history of Apple corporation. Having read/ heard this book, I feel that I have a greater understanding of 'silicon valley'. And especially as to how 'laid back' all the Valley corps are. The book is fabulously written and a must in ones library!
B00CFOXBX2|1.0|Good acting by Rooney Mara and plot but terrible ending.<br /><br />Great build up but led to most one-sided ending ever. Would've been much better with Primal Fear type ending.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I bought this little microphone to improve the audio on some short videos I am making for my website and it has worked perfectly for me.  I am a furniture maker and have limited knowledge of audio and video technicalities but it sure works nicely and for the money really solved my problem.
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|The best METAL BAND of all time!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is sort of like a mash up of Puzzle Quest and Chuzzle. Instead of the typical match-three swap movement, you use a sliding style with infinite scrolling in a single direction. By matching swords, wands and other symbols, you can unlock doors, slay foes or pick up resources to upgrade your toon. The goal of the game is seemingly simple. Get 10000000 points in a single run.<br /><br />At first, with my point progression in my first few dungeon runs, I thought this game was going to turn out to be really short. After a few days of playing casually, I can say this is not the case. So far, I've completed a number of upgrades and unlocked a few things and I'm still sitting around the 1500000 million mark.<br /><br />I have been playing on my HTC One X and find that it runs with zero issues. Loads fast and you're ready to go in seconds. I can't really complain about anything in the game. If I absolutely had to come up with a con, at the end of each level you must wait for the various achievements to scroll through to replay unless you want to tap the button to take you back to your home and crawl down the stairs. Either way you're waiting. But we're talking like 10 seconds tops. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />All of this is possible without permissions, excessive in-game purchases or frustrating progression plateaus. Though I snagged this as a FAOTD, I would gladly pay the asking price for it on another device sometime if needed. Would be great a little time killing Windows 8 app should they ever decide to do so.<br /><br />I'll admit I'm one of *those* people that rates very few things five stars. I feel like once you start throwing five-star ratings around willy-nilly you lose the ability to really give things you find great proper notice. This is a five-star app in every way. Cute retro look, fun and simple soundtrack, addictive gameplay and no need to sell my data to random companies or push ads to my device. Keep up the great work EightyEight!
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Iron Maiden is our favorite band so this is just another IM item for our collection.  We love it and highly recommend it to Iron Maiden fans.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Good graphics and lots of action. The only thing that would make it better is if it gave you more time. Is there a zen mode?
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I was so excited to get this in the mail. Came a day early!!!! (when I got home to see it I was so excited I started to air hump the box at my front door with my friend and immediately went to put it to some good use while playing &#34;Project M&#34; a super smash bros brawl mod) fantastic controller, legit, Longer cable too!!
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|You simply cannot experience the fullness of Saxon without having heard The Power and The Glory for it is one of their best especially from the early catalog. Saxon is simply one of the greatest metal bands of all time with one of the most unheralded and talented twin guitar attacks ever !<br /><br />  Saxon's style of metal is without a doubt some of the best ever, better than Iron Maiden whom of all my years I could never become a fan of. Saxon live in concert is one of the best that you could ever witness just watch what they bring to Wacken each year. Europes biggest music festival. While they may have struggled to gain recognition in the US they have always been loved in Europe and its perhaps that the Europeans knew their metal better than we. Sad but true after all they invented it.<br /><br />  Stop raking albums for not being what you want from beginning to end for very few have ever or will ever be. Especially when you have a band like Saxon who was cranking out albums within months of each other. But I guarantee you one thing each one of them contained some of the sweetest metal and best guitar work that you will ever hear. Saxon in the last 10 years have put out some of their best work however it is the old tunes such as Power and the Glory that make up the biggest part of their concert set list and continue to blow the audience away.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Not bad still a bit rough around the edges reminds me a little bit of forgotten realms from some time ago
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I enjoy the game because it keeps my mind sharp and I have the ability to focus better on other things I enjoy playing for fun
B003KUSUG8|4.0|It's Eminem, you're going to like it.  Love The Way You Lie is my favorite on the CD.  What this album is missing though is the upbeat, fast pace, hard driven song that some of the other albums have.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I find Hill Climb Racing a fun and playful game. Although it is a little glitchy on certain tracks, i find it really fun.
030746363X|5.0|The kettle bell section really helped with strengthening my lower back - it is designed for getting a great bum but really opened my eyes
B0073HNNE8|5.0|I truely loved this book, but I had to read it slowly, - it had so much effect on me,  I just love Jack and I miss him already and I wish I could know how the rest of his life is going to be (and of course his mother's too), - but the end fortunately gave hope:)
