B0052UZIFA|5.0|Definitely love this game, great time killer and very smooth graphics. At times it does lag only for a split second though. Works great on HTC incredible.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|I remember when i was little and I saw TRON...  This Movie as everyone knows picks up where they left off....  very good overall   Highly recommended.  The 3D version is cool. IF you have a 3DTV, I would recommended this purchase.
B004NSVF7C|1.0|I stopped reading this book around page eighty for two reasons.  I kept waiting for just one of the endorsements on the back cover to ring true (Compelling read... Skillfully composed... Galloping foray... Tautly written, wry, thoroughly compelling...) and felt that one of them should have evidenced itself before or by page eighty.  None did.  I read at night before I drop off to sleep and am usually eager to rejoin whatever book I am reading before nodding off.  That never happened with this book. It was a chore to pick it up so it's going to Goodwill.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|This is album is nothing like Fame/Fame Monster. If you are expecting that, then you will  be disappointed. This, however, is a great Euro-pop/rock album with typical dance beats.  Here is a track by track review    1)Marry The Night-- 8.5/10. This song is amazing. I dance to this one quite a bit. Lyrically,  it sounds great and the melody of the song just puts you into a great place when you dance. It  sounds kind of Madonna-ish to me but that is not a bad thing.    2)Born This Way--8/10....No Point going into this song. We heard on the radio. It's a great song  to empower people who feel bad about themselves. Not her best but I just love the message in the song.    3)Gov't Hooker--8.5/10....Quite frankly, I don't know what the hell she is talking about. But it doesn't  matter to me...It's a fun song to me. I find myself quoting \\"As long as I'm your hooker\\" quite often, much  to my chagrin    4)Judas--10/10....I love this song. One of the best song in the album. Awesome beat, lyrically it is great and  she sings very well in this one. I love the metaphor of Judas from the bible to a real life Judas, that I am sure  we all have dated at one time or another....JUDA JUDA AH AH :)    Judas sounds like Bad romance mixed with another one of her previous singles...I want to say pokerface.    5)Americano--7.5/10....Again, I have no idea what she is talking about. I originally hated the song because i hate  the way she sings it but I listen to it...It's fun. No clue what she is talking about but It's definitely a decent  song...The reason it's rated so low is because it is basically a 2011 version of Alejandro.    6)Hair--10/10....She better make a video and this song a single. GREAT MESSAGE. I love the instruments in the song and  she sounds amazing.    I too want to die living as free as my hair ;)    7)Scheibe-9/10...No gaga, you don't speak German but I like this song. People get over it. The Word Scheibe is a dirty  word i guess that means Sh** but I love dancing to this song...Great beat and I love the harmony/melody    8)Bloody Mary--6/10....It's alright. I don't like her voice in this song. I listen to but it's annoying and monotone sounding.  This is basically a rehash of Judas....Seriously...Listen to how she sings in Judas and then listen to how she sings. It's the  same tone...Same religious metaphor like Judas. Not too impressing    9)Bad Kids-5/10....Ehhh, I don't know what to say about this. I don't like it really but it's not horrible. The message and  lyrics don't make sense till you hear the chorus but it's rather...flat    10)Highway Unicorn--2/10....I don't like this song....AT ALL. It is annoying and yet another flat song. Her voice is being drowned  out by the music, and I don't like how i can barely hear her or the lyrics.    11)Heavy Metal Lover--8/10...a fun song to kind of bop your head too. She isn't really singing so much as talking in this song but I  like the beat and the lyrics.    12)Electric Chapel-7.5/10....What the hell is an electric chapel? Idk...But I like the song. It's decent...Fun and she sounds great in  this song. I love her voice...very seductive and mesmerizing.    13)You and I--8.5/10...What's funny is...i hate the song. Idk why I do but I do. However, the lyrics are what made me rate this so high.  I love the lyrics...the message is amazing but what I can't stand is the song. Idk. I think it's because this song would be great as a   slow song but she actually messes it up by using the beats she does for the song. It's too rock to me.    14)Edge of Glory--11/10....Yes, this song is that great. After a few lackluster songs before it, this song is a PERFECT WAY to end the  song. I LOVE IT! Awesome Beat, Awesome Lyrics and this is a song that makes you want to dance and party it up.    I think she wrote this song about a relative or a friend who past away so if you listen to the lyrics, it tells a story.    All in All a decent album, She could have done better. I would have brought the Deluxeedition but from what i sampleld, the songs were  not worth the extra money.    I have been playing this album for 2 weeks now and it is listen worthy except for a few song

B0042RUMIW|5.0|I´ve been a long time fan of sting, bought all his records. But lately I could´t find the magic on his work excpt for his reunion with The Police. But this CD/DVD shows he is still one of the best performers ever. Excellent music, played with passion.  a must buy...
B001EN71CW|5.0|I watched this show when it came out, didn't really get into it until a couple of episodes in.  I only found out later that the reason that the beginning was so choppy was because Fox chose to air the episodes out of order!  I saved these shows on my TiVo until the DVD's came out.  Bought it on DVD immediately and am now buying it again on BlueRay.  This is one of the best shows I've ever seen, great for re-watching a couple of times per year as well.  I was very dissapointed when Fox cancelled the show.

B004QIG7CW|5.0|It might be easy for the jaded among us to dismiss Lemonade Mouth as a TV movie attempt to launch another Hannah Montana franchise, this time with a full group, or to make the High School Musical lightning strike again. That may all be true to a degree; surely Disney Channel would welcome a new vein of gold, especially since so many of their series (Hannah, Jonas, Zack and Cody, Wizards of Waverly) are now in the rearview mirror.<br /><br />But Lemonade Mouth is actually a solid little teen drama with music. The songs are more or less incidental to the story. Each of the leads has his or her own cross to bear and the film is about their journey through acceptance of their situations, not simply easy, Brady Bunch style solutions. They that also launch a successful rock band is perhaps preposterous, but their cohesion as a group is really the focus, not the showbiz glitz. It's not the dazzling Barbie-playset fantasy of Hannah or the recent Sharpay film.<br /><br />And these young people are actually given roles to play, some rather complex. It is a credit to the actors and the director that they don't take the easy route of teenage overacting so common in teen dramas that it almost becomes self-parody (and was actually skewered on Sonny With a Chance, another Disney Channel series that has ended, albeit retooled as a sketch series called So Random).<br /><br />I like this film much more than I expected to and so did my wife. My 13-year-old daughter adored it and watched it multiple times. But parents be warned -- this is not your usual pratfall-but-good-natured goofball Disney Channel fare. One girl is asserting her question of authority, a very natural course for the age group but still uncommon in this venue. But though these kids have fairly dark and realistic problems, it's all done with taste and restraint.<br /><br />Ably heading the cast is Bridgit Mendler, skillfully carrying off a much deeper characterization than she is allowed to do on the broad sitcom, Good Luck Charlie. She reminds me of a young Audrey Meadows, or perhaps Victoria Tennant.<br /><br />Christopher McDonald really should apply for a patent for the role he once again plays -- an insufferable, narcissistic glory seeking bureaucrat -- this time as a principal on wheels. His performance is a nice example of comic timing and lightens the mood as well as providing a foil.<br /><br />And Mel's Lemonade looks like something I would want to buy if I could find it in a vending machine.f a young Audrey Meadows, or perhaps Victoria Tennant.

0316044695|3.0|The writing style reminds me of the WW2 Boys Own stories, where all the soldiers were rugged, compassionate, daring. While this may have been so, unfortunately it fits nicely into all the other stereotypes of soldiers described in innumerable other books. What would have been more reflective was more objective personalities of the troops, because despite being SF, surely they were human first. This personal view is reflected on countless occasions with the reference to the liberal media, with whom Luttrell obviously has a bone to pick.    I agree with the other reviewers who support Luttrell, he is first a soldier and not an author, and the responsibility should be placed squarely at the feet of the real author Robinson for the development of the prose and flow of the story. It actually felt like there were two authors - one for the first non-mission part, and another for the mission.    On another note, surely Special Forces around the world plan for situations exactly like this - being compromised by civilians? Geez, just reading Bravo 2-0 would have prepared them for that eventuality.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I read this book while we were engaged, and it taught us a lot about the different ways to communicate with each other, and the difference between effective communication that promotes love, as well as ineffective communication that actually drives you apart. We re-read it recently with our small group though, having been married almost 4 years, and we both agreed that while it was good to have those foundations early on, a lot of it is much more applicable now. (Mainly because, let's face it, when you're in the honeymoon phase, you can't imagine that you would ever really *fight* over anything haha). Suffice it to say, we have recommended it to all our friends, both the married and the dating, and many of them have gotten a lot out of it as well. While there are other versions out there that may be more relative to certain people (including a version specifically written for singles, though I have not read it), this is an excellent book for anyone who is considering marrying the person they are with or equally excellent for the couple who have been married for decades, who feel that the \\"love is gone\\" and they are just 2 ships passing in the night. Or if you've ever been convinced that your spouse has no understanding of \\"what love is\\". And there's the rub of this whole book. Read it! I have yet to meet a single person who has not gotten something out of it that has benefited their relationships.
0307454541|1.0|The first hundred pages is a total slog to get through.  The idea that a woman could be violently raped and then can't be bothered to deal with authorities is just stupid.  It pretends to be a social commentary on the sexual abuse of women (as it highlights some statistics on the crimes) and then gleefully perpetrates them for us in the most graphic manner.  (Wish I could scrub those images out of my brain.)  The side story of the trial and corporate corruption was just space filler as far as I could tell.  The main story would have gotten along just fine without it.  If anyone that has read this book goes to see the movie, they're just going to watch women get raped on the big screen.  No one would care about this piece if it wasn't for the graphic sexual violence - the rest of the book is boring and clich&eacute;.
0385341679|2.0|After a lot of prodding from friends and co-workers to at least read Shadowfever, this series finale,because so many felt that Shadowfever was such a profound read, I finally gave in and checked the book out from my local library.    For the most part, I found myself skimming past pages and pages of the first person narrative of Mac's internal monologues with herself. Mac never gets out of her own head and the more compelling secondary characters never really found their voice in Mac's world. I tried to enjoy Shadowfever but the story and lead protagonist fell completely flat for me. Without question, this series could have worked better as a trilogy spread out over five books.    None of the women of this book displayed any heroic or redeeming qualities. Mac 1.0 was self-centered, insipid, immature, and stubborn. Mac 5.0 evolved into a conniving, self-righteous, pompous, marginally brighter chit. I despised that ignoramus and uncouth Dani, Rowena was malicious for the sake of creating a mean villainess. I'm glad that the series starts off with Alina already dead because she seemed to be as obtuse as her younger sister.     The two stars are for Jericho Barrons, the only original, unique and compelling character of this series. I cannot fathom why a centuries-old immortal would fall for Barbie doll MacKayla.    Especially upsetting for me was KMM dropping my beloved MacKeltars into this mess and proceeded to portray them as bickering idiots. Moning completely ruined the Highlander series for me and I ended up trading that collection to my used bookstore because I can never again enjoy the wonderful elements of druids, Highlanders, and Scottish-time travel, which drew me to Moning in the first place. I hate when authors incorporate previous characters into subsequent books then proceed to give them personality transplants as idiots.    I'm particularly astounded that this series is being touted as Urban Fantasy, these books are nothing more than a skewered take on Druid and Fae mythology with paranormal elements thrown into the mix. Read Jim Butcher's Dresden Files or Mike Carey's Felix Castor series if you want to experience true and excellent Urban Fantasy.    Although the Fever series didn't work for me, I'm glad I read and finished Shadowfever because now I can truly say I gave it a chance and can close the door on KMM.
0811821846|5.0|My daughter and I were discussing what to buy my nephew for his 6th birthday.  He's a wild one-sweet but always on the move.  If we hitched him to a generator, he'd power up Seattle. He loves the movie High Noon, playing cowboy, and anything having to do with pirates and swords, light sabers and Star Wars.  \\"Why don't you get Daniel a cook book?\\" she asked.  \\"I like the idea, I replied,  but the only way that kid will ever use a cookbook is if it's a Star Wars cookbook\\".  She promptly got on the net.  \\"Here  it is:'Wookie Cookies'!\\" Laughing, we read over the recipes.  They were hilarious, doable, and (thank goodness) available in a plastic coated paging which might make them almost Hurricane Danial proof.  Smoothies, pancakes, cookies, all with awesome Star Wars titles!  We especially enjoyed the caution that the reader would want to use the  mindset of a Jedi warrior to calmly deal with challenges in the kitchen.  How diplomatic!  Daniel was thrilled with his present!  The party came to a stop while he flipped pages, hollering out the names of recipes and showing off the pictures.  Little star wars action figures were artfully posed with the food. Thanks to my daughter's suggestion, we may have created a future world famous cook.    His big brother (two years older)  read over the entire book before the end of the birthday party, and thought it was great.  Of course their mommy thought my kitchen might be a better place than hers to practice his newest Jedi warrior exercises....  Even so, he has mastered the Smoothie and will be out this summer, cookbook in hand to visit me.    Meanwhile, my engineer brother trotted off to work with his version of our Daniel and the cookbook story, only to find that a Star Wars admirer in his office has it as well.  When your cubicle mate is excited about Wookie Cookies you either have an all ages attraction or a niche market.  We're now thinking of buying a copy for my 35 year old son who loves Star Wars for daddy/son bonding inthe kitchen.  The force is everywhere and it is a fun thing.  If you are a serious Star Wars fan, or know a young one who just might get excited about cooking if it's linked to his future as a swash buckler, this is the book for you!

B001OQCV6K|1.0|I'm thinking of returning this DVD because when I loaded the digital disc into my itunes, it let me know that the code had expired. Sure enough, the date on the code instructions expired in March and this is June.  I'm really disappointed because I was looking forward to not only having the disc to watch in my DVD player, but on the go as well. I'm hoping that I will be contacted soon with a new code, or I will be returning this item. Too bad because I love this movie!
0307913090|3.0|This is my first time reading(listening to) Martin.  His world is enormous and his characters are rich and full of intrigue.  However, this is not the book I expected.  I was expecting something along the lines of an adventure in Middle Earth or Xanth.  Instead, I got Danielle Steel set in Middle Earth.  It's kind of bizarre and I didn't find it all that appealing.  My own personal taste, but I just wanted other first timers to know.<br /><br />One the bright side, I have been told by many people who've read all of this series that it continues to improve and is worth the read.  I'm still undecided as to whether or not I'll continue.<br /><br />And since it's an audio book I should note that the narrator does an excellent job.  Many unique voices and great emotion in his reading.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Don't understand how anyone could give this game one star... There is a published list of approved phones it will work on, this is characteristic of how the Android platform works folks!! Game runs smoothly, looks great and will eat into all your free time :) been waiting forever for this one to make it over from iOS. Great job Pop Cap!
B004XOGLBQ|5.0|I loved the soundtrack for \\"Into the Wild\\" -- so this album picks up where that one left off.  All of the songs are natural offshoots of songs like \\"Rise,\\" \\"Far Behind,\\" and \\"Guaranteed.\\"  I think the ultimate test for any artist is to do what Eddie does here-- sing and accompany yourself on your instrument-- no big rhythm section to hide behind, no big time lead guitarist and no stacks of Marshall amps.  As always, his voice maintains the emotion and intensity that has been his trademark all these years, the songs are mostly contemplative and work well in this setting and he demonstrates impressive dexterity on the uke.  Outstanding tracks are: Sleeping by Myself, Without You, Light Today and You're True (accompaniment will remind you of Pete Townshend a little bit).  \\"Tonight You Belong to Me\\" is a fun song that caught some attention in Steve Martin's first movie, \\"The Jerk.\\"  To be honest, I think I like the version performed by Steve and Bernadette Peters a little bit better-- but it evens out. I doubt Steve could do \\"Alive\\" or \\"Black\\" as well as Eddie  :)  Five of the songs date back to ~1930 and 1960; Eddie wrote the remaining 11.  Tenor ukuleles seem to be the main instruments.  While I enjoy a wide variety of music (Lady Ga Ga, Eminem, 50 Cent, etc have their place), one guy on a uke is a great respite from the elements of the music business which have nothing to do with music (e.g. wardrobe, scandal, gangsta attitude, street cred, etc.)  Thanks, Eddie!

0525422943|5.0|I cried. My heart broke and came back together again. I loved reading every single word of this book. There is so much emotions and unspoken regrets that punches you in the stomach.  The story is captivating from the very beginning, never letting you go.<br /><br />Adam and Mia are both great characters with much  history and love. The story was great as it was being told from Adam's point of view. I loved getting inside his heart and his head. I loved watching Mia as she is now. So much has happened in the past few years that to be able to see it all come together was genius.<br /><br />What else can I say that hasn't already been said? This book is simply divine all the way through. If you have not picked up this book you should. It will break you heart like no other book has before, but if will also leave you smiling.<br /><br />Ms. Forman wrote an unforgettable, undeniably, perfect book. It was perfect. The writing, the plot, and both amazing characters had my eyes running with tears and a heart yearning for love.<br /><br />There was some minor cursing  and a sex scene (vague).
B004Q3QRWC|5.0|At first I was skeptical. Interlocking narratives? A plot that goes back and forth in time? An entire chapter that is made of a powerpoint presentation? I am not a big fan of experimental styles, so I steered clear of this book for a long time. Then it won the Pulitzer, and then I just HAD to risk it.<br /><br />And it paid off. BIG TIME. This book is strange, unusual, but it was also brilliant and refreshing. Interlocking narratives have been done many times before, but Egan excelled where many failed. I should probably say she triumphed. The individual chapters, which are dramatically different to each other in terms of style, voice, feel, you name it, just fit effortlessly in the grander narrative framework. The pieces just fall into place, one by one, without you realizing it, you close the book and have a completed puzzle.<br /><br />The story kicked off with Sasha, a former assistant to the great record producer Bennie Salazar, who struggles with her kleptomaniac impulses and, essentially, with her past and present. We follow her stealing a wallet on her date, only to return it, we also find her conversing with her therapist, entangling her personal issues, as the story unfolds. It may sound like too many information is squeezed into a first chapter, but instead of being force fed, we find ourselves served with all that, gourmet-style.<br /><br />Then the story moved on to Bennie, but in a different time space. And as we go from chapter to chapter, we are introduced to many more characters, all in different time and space, too. Each character gives insight to the next, and the connection from one to another cannot have been more delicate, yet cannot be any clearer. Egan seamlessly switched from a third person's narrative to a first person's, even to a second person's and it all worked very well on their own and collectively. The slideshow chapter sealed Egan's ingenuity.<br /><br />Music is an important theme in this book, yet time and the ardent cruelty of living in the \\"passing time\\" or being one whose \\"time has passed\\" seem to be the main theme here. It will take me hours and hours to contemplate all of the different sub themes carefully woven into the plot. I am also certain that I will re-read some of the passages, and look up the songs and artist that have been referenced. But one thing is clear and that is excellently expressed in this quote:<br /><br />\\"Time is a goon, right? You gonna let that goon push you around?\\"<br />Scotty shook his head. 'The goon won.'<br /><br />Brilliant, brilliant (I sound like a broken record now). I can't recommend it enough.r being one whose \\"time has passed\\" seem to be the main theme here.

It wasn't until I opened the album that I realized it only had 13. Unfortunately, the one track I wanted to get (Stuck in the Middle With You) is one of the eight that were left out. Now I'm stuck with the album, and it doesn't have the one track I wanted. Boo-urns!
B004NSULHM|1.0|I certainly don't mind when artists and bands stray from their comfort zones and plow forward in a new direction.  The greats like Dylan, The Beatles, Bowie did it flawlessly, while some contemporary acts like Pearl Jam and Coldplay have also succeeded to different degrees.  Radiohead, more than any band over the last 25 years, is the quintessential example of how not to do this.  Without exception, their works since approximately 2003 have been an uninspired, driveling, messy mess.  A well trained chimp with a computer and a microphone can put out this vomit.    I find that far too often, the term \\"experimental\\" is used to describe a once great band's current efforts by fans that refuse to admit that the band is no longer great.  Radiohead was a great band.  A really great band.  OK Computer, Pablo Honey, et al were superior to almost everything being put out at the time.  However, their works over the better part of the last ten years are painful unless you have a deep admiration for stale, computer generated beats.  King of Limbs is no different.      I've also always wondered how many other \\"electronica\\" albums that the typical Radiohead fan who rates this junk 5 stars actually owns.  My guess would be none.     I admire Radiohead's unabashed willingness to put out the records they want to put out, even if it alienates fans.  The music industry would be a lot better if more bands put out music for music's sake, not for money's sake.  But still, this does not take away from the fact that their music stinks.  Radiohead stinks.  They just plain stink.  There, I've said it.  It's ok to admit it.  I feel better already.
0765322889|2.0|I was recommended this book by a friend who knew I liked GRMM's Song of Ice and Fire series and who said it was good, non-cheesy fantasy. I will give him that - it wasn't cheesy. The characters were generally fairly believable (no super super good guys or evil just for the hell of it guys) but somehow, I failed to care about any of them except maybe one (Lord Anomander Rake). The author throws you in and constantly hits you with new magical phenomena, races, etc. with no intro at all, and then might get around to explaining them through forced feeling dialog 300 pages later. There were so many characters going on in this book, and so many different powers at work that I spent most of the book trying to figure out what was going on. Then the ending is resolved by introducing a brand new race out of nowhere, never before mentioned in the book. Just completely ridiculous.     I gave it a chance, kept thinking it was just on the verge of drawing me in, but it never did. I guess I'm back to waiting for Dance with Dragons.

On the downside, after finishing campaign mode and making much progress in the standalone mode, all of my progress has been lost.  I am not motivated enough to play all the way through again -- especially if that means potentially losing all my progress yet again -- so the game is kinda dead to me.

B0006L0LOS|3.0|Had this movie come out in the 80s or even early 90s it would have gotten good reviews.  Unfortunately, it came out on the heels of a wave of phenonmenal comic book movies and in comparison just doesn't hold up.    That is not to say this is a bad movie.  It is okay.  As far as acting goes, I believe Halle Berry did a phenonmenal job.  The script is decent and the plot is fine.      Unfortunately, the direction and special effects is where the movie falls apart.  Feels like they watched Spiderman right before they decided to do the special effects.  They should have watched the Dark Knight instead.      Had this movie had better direction/directing, I think it could have been 4 stars instead of 3.    amnightus

B004V6MWFU|5.0|Eddie Vedder does a commendable job on this CD. Vedder's characteristic croon goes well with the ukulele and approaches becoming a 21st century Cliff Edwards (both men are baritones with Edwards voice being smoother and Vedder's voice being fuller and a little more impassioned).  Vedder sings sad and melancholy songs like Edwards. Neither performer was a Smeck-like or Shimibukuro-like master of the uke but both men use the uke very effectively to enhance and embellish their songs. Both have voices that are immediately recognizable and in their own way soothing. My favorite bands were WITHOUT YOU, LIGHT TODAY and SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. I also enjoyed the standards, TONIGHT YOU BELONG TO ME and DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME. This album reminds me of Sam Brown's UKULELE AND VOICE CD (from the female perspective, of course). Eddie Vedder pulls this off with some inventive strums and chord progression and his famous pipes. Have never been much of a PEARL JAM fan,but love the ukulele and was skeptical when I listened to this album but MR Vedder sold me! Highly recommended for ukulele players (and perhaps Pearl Jam fans!)A lot of the negative feedback in the other reviews calls to mind the fan outrage when Bob Dylan went from acoustic to electric in the early 60's. Here we are in 2011 with the same scenario.  The fact that Mr Vedder plays his own songs in his own way makes me admire him all the more.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This is a really fun game that I am praying they update soon. After getting fairly far in the game and then turning it off my progress was lost and I had to start all over!  It also takes for ever to load and exit.  Upon exiting my phone acts like it was just rebooted, reloading the SD card and everything.  Great graphics and gameplay though just needs an update before it is playable!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Good drama. No one gets way with this much gunplay and fighting but hey it wouldn't be that enteretaing of it reflected real life too closely. Great character development that is sadly missing from most shows in this day and age. Good stories with awesome character realtionships.
B003F3NDP8|5.0|This season was really good, especially at the start! The seasons starts with answers and the frist episode ends on a dark note! Drea de Matteo was fantastic in this season as a housewife from New York with her own secret! The season finale was pretty good and ended on a good note for some and left you waiting for next season!

0670022411|5.0|This is not a \\"Twilight\\" book - you NEED to read this book.  You will not be able to put it down.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I caught \\"X-Men: First Class\\" over the weekend and enjoyed it. There's a terrific, memorable sequence showing the 1960's era Erik Lehnsherr (pre-Magneto) catching up to some Nazi war criminals hiding out in Argentina, as well as quite a showdown off the coast of Cuba involving the American military, the Soviet military, the X-Men, some mutants lead by Kevin Bacon's villainous Sebastian Shaw, and scores of missiles. Acting and effects are top-notch throughout the movie.<br /><br />The one thing I could have done without, though, is the endless discussion between James McAvoy's Professor Xavier and Michael Fastbender's Erik Lensherr about the political state of mutantkind. As we've already experienced in three or four X-movies before this, Xavier again endlessly goes on about mutants needing to forge a lasting trust with humans, while Erik again endlessly dismisses that view and asserts that mutantkind must be ever wary and, in fact, should probably just dominate and rule humankind before humans try to control and enslave all the mutants. Back and forth, back and forth, the two characters chatter and chatter. What's more, several government types join the debate, too! Sheesh.<br /><br />I understand that this philosophical argument has to be a part of any X-Men movie, but does it have to be front and center all the time? For once, I'd love to see an X-Men film where there's a colorful villain who has nothing to do with the political and social issues of mutant/human relations, and just wants to rob Fort Knox or something. The X-Men comics do that all the time: break up the heavier stories with occasional tales featuring good old-fashioned high adventure, and even a alien invasion here and there.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I still recommend \\"X-Men: First Class\\". In the end, despite my minor gripes, it's still a good time at the movies, stylish and fun. I just could have done with less of the point/counterpoint on the whole \\"can't we all just get along?\\" issue.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|It's a great book. The author weaves about 10 storylines together in Malcom Gladwell fashion - producing an eminantly readable, can't-put-it-down funfest.    Some dude outside of our local REI last week saw my five fingers, and asked if I read this book. I said, huh? He said read it, it will change your life. Actually,  Jesus changed my life. So I figured the dude was exaggerating a bit, that maybe he was missing the bigger picture. But now that I've read the book ... I think the dude was onto something. At the very least this book will change my eating and exercise habits ...

0240815807|4.0|This is the down-low for musicians (or producers) on a budget. There's so much information, it's almost overwhelming. But much appreciated. Wish I had this ten years ago!<br /><br />It starts out with how to listen and what kind of speakers to look for. Good flat-frequency or time-domain response? Why? What's the problem with ported speakers? How should they be placed? Not just the distance and angle, but should you use stands or not! How to balance the instrument mix? Lots of practical advice based on lots of experience on these and other topics such as acoustics, reverb, compression, EQ, effects, where to spend and where to save, ...<br /><br />The layout and color have a kind of retro feel which I didn't quite dig (the blue ovals), but don't let that deter you from a treasure trove of great mixing wisdom.

B003F3NDWG|5.0|This show gets better every season.<br />Castle is a writer who follows around a detective Kate Beckett in New York. Together they catch criminals. He helps her think outside the box. They have an underlying attraction for each other, but the timing seems to be off for them to get together, which keeps you guessing.... This show has a Wonderful cast... including Castle's daughter -an intelligent 17 yr old, his mother-a vivacious actress, the two other detectives that work with Beckett really hold up their end-you gotta love them, a forensics ME, and a loveable Captain Montgomery.  There are a lot of sub-plots and twists that keep you guessing. Really fun to watch especially since Castle has a \\"child-like\\" streak in him. The writers for this show are outstanding, and the actors & actresses are perfectly cast to their roles! Some shows have that \\"special\\" chemistry... this show definitely HAS that special chemistry. They all just fit perfectly in their parts.

It let me buy/download/install it, but it won't run.  Checking the Amazon website, I see a red X next to Moto Droid for 'my device compatibility'.  I guess that means it's not compatible.

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|To bad that SYFY had to cancel this show to make room for more bad reality shows or bad movies or more wrastlin.  SYFY has become the laughing stock of the TV community.And in cancelling this great show the whole Stargate franchise is now dead in the water.  No SG1 or SGA Movie and no more adventures going thru the gate.  Way to go SYFY !!!!  I am currently watching nothing at all on the SYFY channel nor do I see anything to draw me back there.  One last thing I am pissed and imagine many others are as well since the studio has not put this out on blu-ray.  I would not be surprised if the only way to buy it will force you to buy both seasons in some new boxset in time for XMAS.  And if that is the case then I will either not buy it at all or find it used someday.

B00008G9JM|5.0|The Passion Play has to be one of the most unique pieces of \\"rock\\" music ever created.    The range of moods, instrumentals and themes are unsurpassed.  Among several, a good  cut on side #2 begins with the vocal:    \\"Show me a good man, and I'll show you the door; the last hymn is sung   and the Devil cries more\\"    The instrumental that follows here is brilliant--you could group it with fusion jazz,  but it has that unique Tull sound, very Scotland-England, definitely something with   musical detail that has to be listened to carefully.  Tull leads the field in the   Renaissance, classically-influenced music of that time (1970s).
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I'll still give Season Two five stars due to its unstinting excellence, but in truth this season falls slightly short of the powerful wallop delivered in Season One. Season Two is darker all around - Gabriel Byrne's Paul Weston has moved to New York City and his new environs are dark.  He's got a bleak, poorly lit apartment - the darkness seems unrelenting, a feeling made stronger by Paul's bleak mood (putting together a new single life after an ugly end-of-season breakup with wife Kate) and a roster of appallingly depressing cases: Mia (Hope Davis) and her abject, frightening loneliness; April (Allison Pill) and her untreated cancer diagnosis; Oliver (Aaron Shaw) and his warring parents; and Walter (John Mahoney), a high-powered executive whose stress and fall lead to a suicide attempt.  Not what one would describe as a barrel-full of laughs.<br /><br />Season Two lacks the breakout star turn of Mia Wasikowska, whose 'Sophie' character dominated Season One.  Still, for my wife and I, young Aaron Shaw was the emotional center of the series. This middle arc (it's the third episode of each five-week rotation) was the strongest story.  It was heartbreaking to watch how the antipathy between two young parents had completely undermined this kid's confidence and place in life.  Byrne does a wonderful job in that one in nurturing a relationship with Oliver and expressing exasperation - if not outright disgust - in the actions of his parents.  As in Season One, it's the strength of Byrne's quiet - a sign of his active, aggressive listening - that is the hallmark of the show.<br /><br />Like Season One, Season Two re-casts the storylines from the original Israeli production [[ASIN:B004INXCY6 In Treatment -Betipul Season 2- Israeli Tv Series 9 DVD English Subtitles]].  With Season Three, the show's producers have outlasted its inspiration and are forced to come up with original narratives.  Season Two's themes are universal: professional success vs. happiness; cancer (and its effect on shaky family dynamics); divorce and its consequences on innocent victims; and the toll of corporate warfare on its human combatants.  All of these translated readily from Tel Aviv to New York City.family dynamics); divorce and its consequences on innocent victims; and the toll of corporate warfare on its human combatants.

0618918248|5.0|I've read quite a few people telling Dawkins to \\"stick with science, and stay away from philosophy\\" when it comes to this book. Personally, I don't really see it as all that philosophical; in fact, it seems to be based in logic with examples to back up his points, as well as some scientific explanations if necessary.    I would like to point out that if you don't understand or appreciate irony, you may find some parts confusing or irritating; -- I find such humour entertaining, and so have no complaints there. There was also some swearing, but I think they were all quotes; I only mention this for those that are offended by \\"bad words\\" in general. There were some quite grotesque things as well, pretty much entirely from the Bible, hate mail, or quotes.    I think many people, particularly Christians, would benefit from reading this. Unfortunately, many Christians that need to read this won't. But his target audience is right on the mark: Either those that already agree with him in general (such as myself) or those that were brought up in a certain religion and were unaware there was even a question against it, and are interested in reading on, rather than sticking to lackadaisical practices.    I gave the book 5/5 stars, but there were a few things I did not like, but it could just be nit-picking, and definitely didn't warrant marking the rating down, unless by half or less:    <!-- Spoilers ahead -->    (1) His definition of \\"agnostic\\": Dawkins says there is \\"TAP agnosticism\\" (temporary agnosticism in practice) and \\"PAP agnosticism\\" (permanent agnosticism in principle).    Firstly, it's just confusing to use \\"TAP\\" and \\"PAP\\" which are very similar (regardless of whether it was for humour or not), but also because no agnostic actually uses these terms, regardless of whether they're TAP or PAP agnostics. I know many works can create terms that then are used for clarification purposes in the future or in popular culture, but I think this is unlikely to be one of them, specifically because most people that call themselves \\"agnostic\\" as their stance on whether a god or gods exist or not are actually, more often than not, just ignorant of what \\"atheist/atheism\\" mean.    It would have been easier to say \\"original agnosticism\\" and \\"modern agnosticism,\\" or something similar. Agnosticism by its original meaning is that we can't know or don't know something, and has zero to do with a god, which is why we need to say \\"agnostic atheist\\" or \\"agnostic theist\\" (he comes up with a scale from 1 to 7, gnostic theist to gnostic atheist, for this). Modern agnosticism is more of an \\"on the fence\\" position, often only because they seem to think \\"atheist/atheism\\" says, \\"There is no god!\\" when it does no such thing on its own.    I'm sure Dawkins knows what both usages are, what they mean, and all of that, but I think he dressed them up and explained them in an awkward, roundabout manner.    (2) In chapter two, Dawkins says, \\"Any creationist lawyer who got me on the stand could instantly win over the jury simply by asking me: 'Has your knowledge of evolution influenced you in the direction of becoming an atheist?' I would have to answer yes and, at one stroke, I would have lost the jury.\\"    Again, maybe this is nit-picking, but it bothers me that he didn't make the distinction that, even if evolution were wrong, that would not indicate there is a god. He thoroughly describes this when he talks of \\"God of the Gaps\\" later on, but it just seems to me that it could be mistaken for \\"Dawkins does not believe in a god because he believes in evolution,\\" -- which is obviously not true, but I can see many short-sighted readers seeing this and saying, \\"I will disprove evolution, and then I will get Dawkins!\\" -- Which, of course, they do anyway; we just don't need to provide them with any more reasons to.    (3) The Unmoved Mover theory was attributed to Thomas Aquinas, but it's actually Aristotle's. I'm assuming Dawkins is aware of this, but I felt it lacking when this wasn't pointed out, though he pointed out some other similar things elsewhere.    (4) He had a slight rant, -- actually, a rather long one, -- about not teaching children the beliefs of the parents because they are too young to make up their minds: I can't see this changing the minds of many people, particularly religious people. Personally, I would teach children to use logic and to educate themselves, but that is because I see it as the best way for them, and people in general, and I have no religion or god, and therefore find it would be quite easy to do so. But, for someone very religious, the idea of not teaching their child their religion would be absurd. Whether they truly believe the religion or are in denial, they would see this logic as beyond faulty; if they didn't teach their child their religion, it could be damning them to hell, or something else just as terrible. Aren't we all just passing on the knowledge we think right or most important? Wouldn't Dawkins be doing the very same? Wouldn't anybody?    So, yes, perhaps they're technicalities, maybe I'm being anal, but this is small in terms of the book as a whole, which I think to be well-written, logical, ironic, and filled with some interesting facts and theories that I was unaware of prior to this: Usually tidbits here and there, -- why a moth is driven to the flame, &c. -- but I was particularly interested in cargo cults and John Frum, the section called \\"Love Thy Neighbour\\" in chapter seven explaining that it was not very likely the admirable laws in the Bible actually included everybody, but rather just the in-group (the Jews), and the suggestion that bats \\"see\\" colours with their ears and similar perceptions unimaginable to us in our limited world view.    <!-- End spoilers -->    I should point out that I actually listened to the audiobook in favour of multi-tasking, so I will comment on that also: It is read by Richard Dawkins and Lalla Ward. It was at first very awkward: I thought it would be Dawkins reading the book, and Ward reading the quotes (which would have been preferable), but then it turned out they took turns doing this, and it was strange and a bit annoying. But, after a while, it was something I hardly noticed. Other than that, the only thing I have to say is that if you have a difficult time understanding sarcasm in written words, you may find it more beneficial to listen to the audiobook.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I for one am glad I downloaded this for free because I would have felt ripped off if I paid full price for this.  Popcap used low res graphics for many of the art elements. These elements would have been alright if not for the fact that they scaled on the screen and became washed out.  What made this worse is that these elements were badly cropped pngs that had a visible box around them.  The game had one major flaw, it slowed down conciderably after each level.  Over all what shouls have been a 3 to 5 star game was brought down by the lack of quality when the game was ported.  Hopefully, pop cap will fix the game's issues sometime soon.

I suppose I've been spoiled by watching The Dog Whisperer shows in that they're always entertaining.

I wish there had been more of the personal and less of the clinical.
B001E45XT4|1.0|As you've aged, have you grown a bit cold? Do you turn off \\"human interest\\" programs on TV because you're not interested? When some druggy cleans out your apartment, do you sit on the floor (no chair) and watch the wall (no TV)? Are you the one saying, not tonight, dear?    Well, this headset may revive your passion. Not the headset, exactly, but, rather, the packaging of it is what will turn you on. It is IMPOSSIBLE to open. I tried scissors and razor-blade knives. When I did make a slit in the reenforced. carbon-fiber armored clamshell, I did not have the strength to pull it apart. As the minutes wore on, I felt the long-forgotten heat rise within me. A few minutes longer and I was screaming, wildly banging the thing on my desk, on the walls, on the floor. As adrenalin flooded my body, I took the thing into the garage and opened it with a bandsaw.    I can't tell you how well it worked because the saw had cut it in half. I enjoyed that. :) Now, though, when I'm bored or tired, all I have to do is remember this headset: in seconds my nostrils flare and my blood boils. Kudos to Plantronics!    I recommend everyone buy this set first to have the epiphany, then buy the Creative wireless headset (H-1200) you should have bought in the first place. Yes, it does cost more than this low-end piece of #$%@, but at least it's usable as a headset. And, as a bonus, to revive my marriage, I think of this headset, throw my wife on the bed, then ravish her. She loves it. I am alive again! I am a man!

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|First, the writing in this movie is dreadful.  The acting is dreadful.  The plot is dismal.  The wardrobe is over the top, not in a good way.  The stars, except for Cynthia Nixon (Miranda), look long past their expiration date -- more so than the supposedly 8 year gap suggested by the plotline.  Don't get me wrong, they're still attractive, but Sarah Jessica Parker is developing a proclivity for unattractively-styled too-long hair plus Ruth Buzzi's massive chin; Kim Cattrell is fighting the inevitable thickening that comes with age; and Kristin Davis is beginning jawline droop.  They're kittens no longer, but the dialogue and the plotline suggest they are.  It doesn't work.      This movie proves the truth in the statement \\"We can't go home again.\\" I'd rather live with my many, many happy memories of this delightful TV series, thank you.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I don't think that you can purchase a better set of headphones for the money, although, I think these are being replaced by the 240MKII's, which interestingly has the same specs as the 240Studio.  These are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time and are very lightweight.  I also use the Shure 440's closed headphones, which is an awesome set of headphones, but become uncomfortable after using them after a short while.  All in all, I have become to like AKG for their \\"open\\" sound, and I have found that the bass, which is always coming scrutiny, and the basis of complaints, is rather firm and nicely portrayed, not \\"boomy\\" by any means.  I use the AKG 240Studio's everyday for hours at a time and find them great in every way.
B004M66YSA|4.0|Thanks in part to The Pains of Being Pure at Heart's eponymous 2009 debut, the Black Tambourine catalog has been reissued and, more importantly, we've heard that some sort of My Bloody Valentine-related project is soon on the way. This is what we call influence done right. This same sort of thing happened in the early 2000s, when The Strokes so openly called back to the then-somewhat-forgotten (but oh-so-obvious) sound or garage rock-turned-poppy. These two bands, with their debut records, created mini-retro movements. Good ones, though, that brought the past up to date through song.    Revivalists? Precious winkers? Inspired NYC art geeks? Here, for their second release, the uber-poppy Belong, the Pains kids have hired a couple real studs to help out, including legendary producer Flood and mix master Alan Moulder. Why mention the studio geeks, you ask? Well, in their continuing attempts to be authentic 80s-meets-90s impressionists, the Pains have put together the exact studio team necessary to do so. Moulder not only helped push the Yeah Yeah Yeahs into the mainstream almost a decade ago, but in the decade before that he worked with everyone from The Jesus and Mary Chain, My Bloody Valentine, The Smashing Pumpkins, Depeche Mode and more. As for Mark \\"Flood\\" Ellis, well, he helped many 80s and 90s-era artists along their way, most notably helping establish the shoegaze-influenced sounds of the Pumpkins, Depeche Mode and many others. So, ace team lined up at the boards, the boys and girls of Pains went into the studio to play for keeps, ready to make a 90s-shoegaze-meets-80s-synth-pop masterpiece bigger than their stellar debut. Sounds unlikely right? I mean, dang, that was one killer debut batch.    We hear the key to this record instantly on opener \\"Belong\\" - a bigger, fuller sound, with production that reminds instantly of classic-era Pumpkins (never a bad thing). The hooks are once again key and the compositions, while pretty much always accomplished, are accessible if not inventive. But forget all that; at the heart, the 10 tracks on Belong are pop songs that just happen to be masked behind a cloak of retro style. The songs, which are fairly simple - and dreamy - twee-pop compositions, are incredibly solid, making the record a wholly worthwhile follow-up to their much loved debut. And damn, this is a very listenable, poppy, fast-passing record. If the current trends were different (Smiths/Pains instead of Madonna/Gaga), I could see a cut like \\"Heaven's Gonna Happen Now\\" being a big radio song. It reminds a bit of M83's excellent Saturdays=Youth record from a few years ago, feeling almost like a theme song to a lost John Hughes movie. It's an anthem of the young - a real one that I'm certain will matter very much to Late Night Kids everywhere. (Have you seen Nick and Norah's Infinite Mixtape yet? Those are the kids.)    \\"Heaven's Gonna Happen Now,\\" while instantly amazing, isn't even the highlight here. \\"Heart In Your Heartbreak,\\" a similarly anthemic track, feels even more epic, boasted by a classic 80s-sounding guitar solo, layer after layer of melodic riffage and keys, and a hook that sticks for days. Singer/songwriter Kip Berman's breathy and childlike vocals are the perfect fit for the young adult vibes here; I won't be a bit surprised if the man (who has really stepped up his presence on this record) becomes one of the cult heroes of his generation, thanks to not just his songwriting, but his preternatural ability to WhisperSing(tm)  exactly how we all feel in our most fleeting moments - age be damned.    Another standout, \\"My Terrible Friend,\\" pushes The Cure vibes to the limit, prompting listeners to get in their car, pick up some friends, turn it up and drive all night. It's the same fuzzy and chime-y sound we heard on the debut, but here the fun and drama is thicker, bigger, more complete. Luckily for us, the songwriting is also on par with the debut. What we end up with is the best MBV/Cure/Smashing Pumpkins/Smiths hybrid we could ever hope for. And with the help of stud studio dudes like Moulder and Flood, the record falls out of the speakers in an almost magical way, evoking the forget-it-all power associated with all great pop music. Belong ends up being maybe the best youth soundtrack since the first Strokes record all those moons ago. Better than the eponymous debut? Tough call. One thing's for sure - both are essential pop and/or rock listening, regardless of your age. A good pop hook/melody combo translates across generations and genres.

B00005Q4CS|1.0|As I have said in my title PLEASE READ THE BOOK, because the book brillantly breaks down the individual struggle of each character as they dive deeper and deeper into drug addiction.  The book deals with alot of inward thought and emotions, which is hard to capture in film.  Even though Hubert Selby Jr. (the original author) was involved in the making of this film I believe it could have been executed better.

So many delicious (on the easy-side but if you're a novice baker, I'd suggest starting with a Cake Mix Dr. book)and creative recipe ideas!
B0013D8LCW|4.0|This movie made me wanna pack my bags, move to San Pedro, work in a greasy diner, meet a rich surfer/writer dude with writer's block, who would teach me to surf and I would become the inspiration for his next best-selling novel and we would live by the beach and wear pooka shells and nothing else!!!!!(hey a guy can dream right!???) For real though..this movie is soooo nice to look at & the characters of brad rowe and Trevor are so likeable..u find yourself constantly rooting for each of them...I loved this movie and will add it to my collection...right next to latter days!! LOL!!!!
0307477479|4.0|I stayed away from this book for the longest time because all the hype put me off.  I usually don't like highly promoted books.  But I finally gave in, and am so glad I did!  The book is short stories that are interlinked, all revolving around a man who puts gold flecks into his coffee cup to keep himself healthy and happy.  From him, the book traces his kids, his coworkers, and childhood friends.  It jumps back and forth in time, yet it's pretty easy to figure out the connection.    The big deal is her writing.  She can describe broken glass in a way no one else can.  Sometimes she uses phrases that just stop you in your tracks, they are so unexpected.  One character looks out over the SF Bay area skyline and realizes although she's a child, the world is just so big.  Her realization that she is but a small figure in a bigger reality isn't melodramatic or corny...it's a realization that seems true.    Great book...and if you have grown up in CA, especially interesting because many locations are mentioned.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Great game, but I got to 4-7 the second time around and then lost my information. Very disappointed. This took a long time... and now I've lost Quick play. Almost got all of the achievements, too.
0345529057|5.0|This series is the best I have ever read. The author clearly knew that this genre was getting very repetitive with the hero always going against greater odds and vanquishing his foe with only a few cuts to himself. Here you never know what will happen next, who will die and more. Highly recommend this series.
B004EPYZOO|1.0|(1.) Still another example of an aging actor not role challenging himself but declining towards the money.     (2.) Ripoff storyline of someone coming back from the dead with a revengeful stalking of the representatives of evil (i.e. Satan with his always present alternative names).  Can't they be a bit more creative than bon fires and baby sacrifices?  And, the usual cheap money maker of flying bullets, pointless sex scene and the getting-old-fast 'n furious driving. Then we have the typecast human looking types with God like powers always showing them off in trivial pointless ways. (Why? Just to have filler visuals for the film.) They always seem to lose anyway. You would think that with their superior capabilities that they would just do the job and leave but then there wouldn't be a movie.       (3.) For some reason older cars must bring in a lot of nostalgia money because they always show up in abundance in these type of movies. If you ever drove one you wouldn't want to again.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game itself is great. Looks great, has a nice reward system, keeps me entertained. Unfortunately, it also has a bug that might delete your save file. It's happened to me twice now and from checking online it seems to be a fairly common problem on a few other platforms as well. 5 stars when I feel safe to dump more time into this game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Droid X.  No problems at all.  I have been wanting this for a while and it finally is here!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I have a Droid 1 and a Xoom, so my experiences are based from the fact that when you clear a level and get a new seed your first time through Adventure, the frame rate drops incredibly low for no reason.  Now, the game itself is amazingly fun and one of the best tower defense style games out there, so its definitely worth a look if you haven't played it before. However, if you have played it before and loved Survival Endless know that this iPod port doesn't have it (which sucks for me as I loved that mode. 407 flags on the Xbox version). At least, if its there then I can't find it, lol. None of the quick play modes, unlocked after beating adventure, are labeled, so if survival is in this game then I have no idea what options to push.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is just what I had been looking for. A good streaming radio app that has so many choices and can tell where I am and find local stations as well as finding talk and news radio from almost anywhere in the world. Great job!
B004X8W42M|4.0|I was really excited to read this book because throughout my entire life Black Sabbath as well as Ozzy Osbourne blasted through every radio, disk-man, and Ipod.  This was such an entertaining book, however I have to agree with Ladd Herbert that the book was abridged.  Jake E Lee was omitted; also I was expecting more information on the story of how Zakk Wylde came into his life since he was around the longest during Ozzy's solo career.<br /><br />There were so many emotions riddled in this novel, he really did share a lot, the good, the bad, the disturbing, the hardships and emotional shut downs.  Some parts were hard to read as well.  I really have to disagree with Durgadas \\"Yogi for peace\\".  His review seemed very jaded because he is a hardcore Sabbath fan and has a strong dislike towards Ozzy saying \\"...one drug-addled totally clueless person's antics who's main contribution seems to have been being clueless, drunk, high or stoned throughout the entire time a great band was being formed.\\"  His entire review is just his animosity towards Ozzy.<br /><br />In this novel Ozzy had many forms of methods of influence, however one method that stood out quite a bit was overgeneralization.  One example of this is \\"It was a lot of fun, but it was f---ing grueling, man.  Every day we'd start at noon and end at two in the morning.  You'd do speed, pills, dope, beer- anything you could lay your hands on- just to stay awake\\" (86).  He makes it seem like doing drugs and drinking alcohol were the only ways to stay up, however many musicians do not do anything like that and are still able to live the life of a rock star.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the memoirs of a true rock legend.<br /><br />Senior English Student 2011

0307454541|4.0|\\"The girl with the dragon tattoo\\"  by Stieg Larsson, was published June 23, 2009. This book for me was great from beginning to end.<br /><br />This story was based on a girl, Lisbeth. She has many tattoos and piercings, but one in particular is the large tattoo of a dragon on her back. She makes a living doing investigations. She later meets a guy named Blomkvist who is being accused of a crime. They meet and try to solve this tragic investigation.<br /><br />The author did a really good job with the plot of this book, even though there are some parts were he is very detailed with what happens to the character Lisbeth. It was kind of disturbing because in the book Lisbeth went though some domestic violence but you can see that the author was just trying to show how some domestic violent takes place.<br /><br />Overall this book was just a great book, very interesting and captivating too read.<br /><br />Senior English Student 2011
B004ZZITEU|1.0|When Trey told us to expect \\"electronic influences\\" in the new Morbid Angel, I thought he meant, y'know, real electronic music, not parody 90s industrial music from The Matrix. I'm all for experimenting, but that's what this band always was doing; this shallow Pantera industrial groove rock concoction is an artistic regression on all levels.<br /><br />\\"Crossing the line since 1989!\\" David barks in one song. Does that really warrant an album of self-celebratory moron rock full of lyrics about how \\"radical\\" and \\"hardcore\\" they are? \\"Maniacal and animal.\\" \\"Come to me moist.\\" Oh lord, it's all flooding back. Charlies in the trees...<br /><br />It's like they tried to warn you with the Sub-Behemoth album art and butchered Latin. It's not the worst album in the world, but it is pretty much the perfect storm of confused alpha male posturing and \\"still with it\\" wash-uppery. Repent, sinners. Death metal is spiritually dead.
B0007KTBIU|4.0|I rate this 4 stars because nothing is perfect and this movie has a fair share of flaws. My only real problem with this film is the sometimes annoying animal buddies that detract from the feel of the rest of the plot. Other then that I love the plot, Characters, Art, Animation, and Music, Heck I would buy a whole new CD if they ever release the in movie version of \\"If I never knew you\\".

B00000K413|5.0|This is a record that all music lover must have in their collection, this Debut shows TFF doing what they were supposed all the time. This is not their most successful album, which is Songs from the Big Chair, but I believe this is their best. The New Wave played on this album may take you to think TFF would be one of the greatest dark wave artists on the scene; however this pop takes you to an unlimited play... a timeless classic!    A plus is the 4 bonus remixes! 5/5
B004OKFIQI|5.0|Nothing has ever been simple about Rumours and the same can be said about the vinyl reissues from this year, of which there are three.  First, there is the gold-standard, 2LP/45RPM, issue mastered by Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray.  Next is the single LP/33RPM, again mastered by Hoffman and Gray.  These two issues were designated for the United States, will always indicate they were mastered at Pallas, which is in Germany and, for those who really want to get down and dirty, will have this etched in the dead wax: \\"KG + SH @ ATM\\".  To simplify matters, it is pretty much universally agreed the 45RPM version sounds better than the 33RPM version, and based on the nature of the manufacturing of LP's this makes sense even though both products were made from the same master-tape created by Hoffman and Gray.  Finally, there is a rather mysterious, 2LP/45RPM issue designated for distribution outside of the US which was not mastered by Steve Hoffman and Kevin Gray and, questions of the nature of the sound aside, DOES NOT represent Rumours as it came out of the box in 1977.  What I just wrote is factual, and based on comments from Steve Hoffman on his web site concerning these releases.  In the comment section below, I will provide many pertinent hyperlinks.  Now let's break down what I have just written a bit more, beginning with matter of trueness to the original and then moving on to the sound (although the two do overlap some).    In the process of preparing this reissue Hoffman and Gray were confronted with a myriad of puzzles.  Many centered around the final track to this album, Gold Dust Woman.  There exist at least three different endings to this song that can be found, even at the earliest stage of vinyl release.  There exist at least two different beginnings to the song as well.  Over time, Hoffman and Gray figured out the first vinyls pressed contained a countdown at the beginning of the song, not the fade-in that many are familiar with, and a certain progressing louddynamic structure at the end.  So this is what you will be getting on the Hoffman and Gray masters.  As a side note, just to give two examples, the fade-in came into existence because, over time, the intro to this song on the master-tape used for most of the issues deteriorated and the solution chosen was to simply use a fade-in for this song to cover-up the deteriorated intro.  As for the ending of this song, the dynamics proved too challenging for mastering techniques at the time so, very shortly after release, the dynamics of the song's end had to be dampened so that mass production of vinyl could occur without Warner Bros. having a bunch of albums returned because record players skipped, distorted, etc., the end of the song.  Only the Hoffman and Gray masters contain the correct intro, e.g. the European issue has the fade-in, so the Hoffman and Gray issue is the truest to the original issue (Without much elaboration, there have been different versions of Second Hand News over the years, even beginning in 1977.  The Hoffman and Gray issue contains the version found on the earliest vinyl issue.).  Now let's move on to the sound.    The objective part is to write that if what you want is the best sound, there is pretty much universal agreement the Hoffman/Gray 2LP/45RPM version trumps the Hoffman/Gray 1LP/33RPM version.  There is some debate out there on the relative sound quality between the US and European 2LP/45RPM versions.  As I have not heard the European version, I will not comment on this.  But remember, the European version does not contain the truest-to-the-original version of Gold Dust Woman.  What I feel comfortable in saying is this: If one takes the time to read the relevant threads on Steve Hoffman's web site concerning Rumours it is quite easy to have a fair number of questions about the European issue.  So, in the words of former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld: with Hoffman and Gray we have a known known, with the European issue we have unknown unknowns.    The subjective part is to comment on the sound of the Hoffman/Gray 2LP/45RMP issue.  Personally, I think it is wonderful, but it may not be what you are used to.  The reason for this is the sound of Rumours, even when it was selling millions of copies in 1977 and 1978, kept changing with different pressings.  Again, this is documented in Ken Perry's notes, Ken did the original mastering, and these notes were used by Hoffman and Gray to prepare their issue.  As nearly always, Hoffman did some tweaking, using tubes at times to master, adding a decibel or two of EQ here and there (this is not a lot).  But what is most important is the work done by Hoffman and Gray did not damage the dynamic range of the material.  There is always a certain amount of art that goes into a reissue, and this (the art) is one factor that can make a reissue more appealing to some and less to others.  Another factor that can contribute, and this might play a larger role with this reissue, is the fact the vast majority of people who have heard Rumours have not have heard the content of the songs, in that which was their original state, until this issue.  So familiarity, or lack of familiarity, will play a role.  Finally, the quality of one's sound system will play a role as well (On that note, my system's front end is a Rega P324 with a Dynavector 20X2H cartridge and the back end is comprised of a pair of Quad 988's with a Rel Britannia B2 Sub-bass.).    In conclusion, no one knows what the future will bring.  A very compelling case can be made that if one's goal is to own something that is closest to what Ken Perry heard when he finished the first mastering of Rumours, and one owns a sound system that can do justice to a true audiophile recording, then you should strongly consider purchasing the Hoffman/Gray 2LP/45RPM edition given the combination of the improvements in record mastering techniques since 1977 (being able to get the dynamics of Gold Dust Woman right now when it couldn't be done in 1977 is an example), and the natural deterioration that takes place with magnetic tape.  Finally, given what Hoffman and Gray had to go through to put this project together, again best explained by Hoffman himself on his web site, don't expect high-resolution files of Rumours that will rival this release any time soon unless they originate from the work done by Hoffman and Gray.  And, come to think of it, even if you presently do not have the ability to make high-quality high-resolution files, or a fine conventional CD burn of an LP, purchasing this album now will at least give you the ability to do so down the line and, therefore, have a definitive high-resolution digital version of this album.    Again, some time after posting this, I will add a comment with hyperlinks that will aid those who wish more information on the mastering process and the foundations for my conclusions.
B004RQVVGU|5.0|Like 99.9% of other Ozzy fans, I hated the 2002 crap with re-recorded bass and drums.  Ozzy says it was Sharon's fault, most fans blame both of them, but I don't really care anymore.  That mistake from 2002 can now be swept under the rug.  This version is highly recommended to anyone who does not currently own Diary on cd, and to hardcore fans who already do, as they did a good job keeping the price reasonable, and the content is fantastic.<br /><br />If anything, the restored bass and drums on Diary have been brought up in the mix; the bass especially has a hearty thump to it, making it noticeably more bottom-heavy than the 1995 release.  It's also louder and clearer, with every note of the bass clear and powerful.  Excellent production that doesn't take anything at all away from the guitar tracks or the vocals, which sound crisp and clean.<br /><br />Extras:  Ozzy Live bonus cd, with live tracks from the Blizzard tour.  It's definitely not Tribute, as some people have wondered.  The sound quality is not quite up to that album, but the performances are incredible.  I actually think I Don't Know rocks a little harder here than on Tribute.  And Believer, which Ozzy tells the crowd will be on his forthcoming album, Diary of a Madman, is AWESOME.  It's slower and has more of a groove than the final album version, and Ozzy's vocals are way more aggressive.  Great, great stuff.  The band kills it on every song, and Ozzy sounds young and energized.  In addition, the digipack panels and booklet have several photos from the Diary album shoots that I hadn't seen before, as well as other vintage photos.  Given the quality of the packaging and sound, this is easily a five-star release.
B004LWZW42|5.0|The prequel to the X-Men trilogy explains how it all started. In 1946 two young men, mutants, with distinct powers emerge. The story jumps to 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The two men recruit other mutants to prevent a deranged man from starting WWIII. The thing that separates this from some other films in the superhero genre is that this is a movie with a strong storyline carried by talented actors. This is more than a fun film for fanboys, but a movie that can be appreciated by all audiences. The visuals are amazing, as are the nuance performances by the film's talented cast.
0439023483|5.0|This book is what I would call addictive. I could not put it down...not even to use the restroom (I know, TMI). I am a middle school teacher and these books are getting my students to WANT to read...not HAVE to read. If you get this book, be sure to go ahead and purchase the second the third one because you'll want to continue right away once you finish...guarantee it. If you have a teen that refuses to read, hand them this book and you won't hear from them for hours. But it's great for adults, too.
0891419063|5.0|This was a pleasure to read from page one to the end.  I read at night after getting in bed and several times, I had to force myself to put this down cause I had to work the next day.  I'll often go to bed at 11pm and read a half hour, but with this I found myself up on work nights at 2 or 3am.  Thankfully, I finished it in just a few nights.  I'll have to start this on a friday night next time I read it, and I fully intend to read this again.  Not because I really enjoyed the subject matter, but, it truly is delivered that well.<br /><br />I suppose I could relate to Sledge insofar as I think we share a lot of common personality traits.  I must believe this book portrays his attitude accurately, and I fully agree with his feeling toward the incomprehensible waste, how that would fester into hatred.  And how the miserable conditions would labor on you after such a long time in them.<br /><br />Imo, Sledge really comes across as the average you or me who got stuck in a war and simply wants it all to end.  It's a very captivating book, and by any standard, this is a great piece of literature.

0810979772|5.0|I used this as an end year incentive to get my students to read the whole series.

We watched the first movie before the end of the year too!  It was awesome!
0425242099|5.0|I found the Psy-Changling series relatively late, so I was lucky to be able to skip from one book to the next - all the way through book 9 in the series, Play of Passion. Which was great, but also a little torturous, as the buildup for Hawke and Sienna's story was a lingering theme through all of the books. By the time Kiss of Snow was released, I was nearly dying of anticipation.     I have to say that this book did not disappoint. Prior to this book, my other favorites in the series were Brenna and Judd's story and Indigo and Drew's story, but I think Hawke and Sienna are now my all time favorite! I know some people commented that the buildup was repetitive and a little slow, but I completely disagree. I was practically panting with each scene they were in together, whether it was sexy or not - their chemistry was that amazing. Until this book, I never had a clear picture of what attracted Hawke to Sienna (she was very young when she came into the pack), but this book lays it all out there. I especially loved how in the beginning, Sienna tries to make Hawke jealous and he falls for it hook, line and sinker. I also loved how he finally opens up to her about his past - the ending is just so sweet and poignant.     I thought the writing of both of their characters was really good in this particular book. There have been a couple of books in this series where I definitely wasn't connected to the characters that much (in a weird way, I felt like I didn't know them very well). I never felt this way with Hawke and Sienna while reading their story. I'm sure part of the reason for this is that we've seen Hawke and Sienna off/on in some of the other books, so their backstory was a little more developed than characters in other books. However, kudos to Singh for continuing to surprise with details on Sienna's history and Hawke's painful past. It was done very well, in my opinion.    I also loved the short story of Lara and Walker that was woven into the main storyline. I thought it was the perfect amount - it added to the story without taking away too much from Hawke/Sienna. The buildup of the Psy civil war was also a secondary storyline, but (in what she does so well) Singh managed to make it progress without dragging on too long.     If you are a fan of this series, I think you will really enjoy this book. Like other reviewers, I strongly encourage anyone new to the Psy/Changling series to start at the beginning. As far as paranormal romance goes, I believe it's one of the most intelligent and consistently well-written series out there.

B000JQUMPI|4.0|I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it.  Although the religious undertones are pronounced, the story still draws you in -- you want to know what happens to these girls and their world is very vividly created.<br /><br />Like many free Kindle books, there are multiple typos.  However, it didn't really detract from the reading experience for me.
B004DL5K2K|4.0|this is wellworth the money much better than the rerelease of a few years ago the version with the randy rhoads guitar tracks and robert trijhio on bass and rodney bottom on drums because those sound bad because the guitar stand out as a dated sound from the 80's .this version is very good the whole cd sound better and up dated nothing stand out or sound out dated even if it is.this is much improved and is fuller and cleaner than the original not to mention back ground sound effects that were buried under the main music is now audible.
1423113381|5.0|...but here's my attempt.<br /><br />I bought this book because I immensely enjoyed Riordan's \\"Percy Jackson & the Olympians\\" series. My fear was that this would just be Percy Jackson only with Egyptian rather than Greek mythology. I need not have worried. Although there are similarities (ancient myths in the modern world, young protagonists discovering unsuspected potential, ancient forces stirring after a long hiatus, etc) the differences are significant. Foremost of course are the different cultures from which these mythologies sprang, reflected in the book by coequal brother sister protagonists. Riordan drops a big hint that both series share the same world although this series can be read without prior knowledge of the Percy Jackson books.<br /><br />The book is longer than any of the Percy Jackson books. Not only this, it has far more of an international flavor with the action jumping from London to New York to Egypt to Paris to Washington and points west. The characters are also of a more cosmopolitan mix than in the America centric Percy Jackson series.<br /><br />The plot is as good as any in the Percy Jackson series with twists and turns, non stop action, and marvelous touches of humor.<br /><br />I only wish there were books like this when I was a kid. Highly recommended.
0385737955|3.0|This starts up interestingly: a teenager with no memory of his past finds himself dumped into an idyllic glade full of other teen boys with no memories of their own either. The glade is a nice enough place to live, but it's surrounded by a maze into which horrific monsters emerge by night.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't feel the storytelling through the rest of the book worked as well for me as the beginning. The protagonist, Thomas, never gels for me. Part of this is that he doesn't have any memories to work with, but the rest of it is that all of his motivations are ones he doesn't understand and blindly follows. I never really connected with him.<br /><br />Too, the premise is a difficult one to maintain, and I don't feel it's marvelously well justified except with vague references to reasons for creating the environment the boys are in toward the end.<br /><br />The ending was a great disappointment to me. Yes, the story moved on to a new phase, but no real light was shed on anything, and the huge emphasis on one character's death feels artificial and distracting to me.<br /><br />I came into this book hoping for something I would like as much as The Hunger Games, which I admit is shooting high. I was more or less entertained throughout the book and wouldn't try to talk anyone out of reading it, but unfortunately the story falls fall short of The Hunger Games and its sequels, and I'm not motivated to pick up the next in the Maze Runner series.

B00026WU7I|5.0|I bought a CD that was rated in 'good' condition and it turned out there were a few tracks that skipped.  It took me a while before I listened to the entire CD and discovered the defect, about a month.  I contacted the seller, and they emailed me back right away and credited my account.  I didn't have to waste postage sending it back either. I am really impressed and grateful.  Thanks goHastings!!
B004WJV6OY|5.0|I lived in Seattle when PJ hit in the early 90's and have been along for the ride ever since.  This DVD shows how much Eddie has developed and matured as an artist; he's a really 'earthy' guy.    My wife and I have listened to 'Into the Wild' to death, often playing it two or three times in a row in the car on road trips (Ukelele Songs will go into rotation now too), as well as PJ's 'Backspacer'.  Ed has moved into a very interesting musical space over the past few years, and he's a pleasure to listen to.    On the dvd...Ed does a fine and diverse setlist here, with nice dynamics in his performances.  He carries off the one-man show brilliantly, and the audience is loving and enthusiastic without being noisy or disruptive to the show (which Ed acknowledges to them, as this was an issue on occasion for the solo tour).     Excellent audio and camera work, and I liked the 'off stage' sequences as well.  Everything about this disc oozes Ed's artsy, earthy, and surfing ways.  He's such a laid-back cat...I enjoyed the scenes at the end with the fans on the street, and how he so prefers quiet accolades and thank you's to shouts of \\"I LOVE YOU MAN!!!\\" and requests for hugs.      Ed's sense of humor is on display here as much as his rich baritone and guitar/uke/mandolin skills.  Funny little anecdotes interspersed here and there, and delivered with a twinkle to his eye.      The way that he does his stage setup makes it feel so intimate, like he's playing just for you in his living room.      I can't wait to watch this again...it holds up to repeated views like ITW and Ukelele Songs and Backspacer do for repeated listens.  Cannot recommend highly enough for fans of Eddie Vedder.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I used to use this app all the time, maybe not to purchase items from Amazon, but to research prices and remember titles. I had a long list of items in my Amazon Remembers collection. Now it seems as if that feature is no longer available plus I have lost the list of items I was saving in that app. Small time issue for me but could be a big one if a small business was relying on that app.    Updaters beware.
0887307280|1.0|I'm really shocked this is not only book, but has become a mini-empire or phenomena of sorts. Why? It's content can be summarized in one sentence: Any and every aspect of your business should be created and formulated with a stardarization as if it were a franchise. In otherwords, every aspect of your business should be replicated as franchizable. That's it. The rest is pure fluff. Now stop wasting time, move along, and get busy on your dreams.
B004M8KLYQ|5.0|God save the Queen.. yes..    This is a great great great album. Beautiful, historic, epic, emotional..PJ Harvey deserves a big \\"thank you\\" by making music so meaningful. Definitely one of the best albums of 2011. Today, only and only PJ harvey could write an album like that.
0671646788|1.0|I know, I know, everyone wants you to honor the purported classics. But really, this book is not very good. In fact, it's some pretty outdated positive-thinking froth.

B000E41MS6|1.0|i am really trying to find something out of this that i like.  \\"camp\\" is not sufficient for me to overcome the poor pacing and obviousness.  after three episodes, i'm trying to find some part of the show to keep me engaged.  i'm a huge fan of science fiction but this seems to be written and acted in a way that leaves little to the imagination.  it's not that it has to be smart necessarily but this is so bordering on the un-intellligent that there's no place for subtlety and sloppy direction is turning these characters into mere caricature.    if you demand a bit more from your science fiction, i'd say look elsewhere or adjust your expectations.
B003I55BIA|4.0|I read this book quite a while after it came out and thoroughly enjoyed it. I particularly liked the internal and external conflicts both Brittany and Alex face. The sister-sister and mother-daughter relationships were also an engaging addition to the story. If you enjoy a touching, star-crossed lovers romance, you'll enjoy this book. My only criticism is the epilogue. The ending was perfect just how it was and the epilogue actually detracted from that.    If you like Perfect Chemistry, try [[ASIN:B004LLIHYU The Body Finder Low Price with Bonus Material]].
B00514HDNW|5.0|I can't believe the author wrote this in the 50's!  It is obviously influential on how vampires and zombies have been depicted in other books, tv shows and movies.<br /><br />GREAT novel (novella?  it was pretty short).  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves apocalyptic stories.  Its a classic.<br /><br />The movie is nothing like the book.
0545123275|5.0|I loved this sweet story with well developed characters that I grew to love and care about, who are vulnerable yet still have gentle personalities despite the dysfunctional events in life that have affected them, or perhaps because of those events that have shaped who they are. There is a fine balance between realism, identifying with the characters, and fantasy that made this a riveting story for me that I could not put down.<br /><br />I was happy and satisfied with Linger, the followup to Shiver. You have the opportunity to dwelve deeper into the characters, understand more who they are, and have introductions to new ones that are equally as compelling. I also could not put this sequel down and I really look forward to reading the third book. This author is talented, this story and its characters grow on you. I highly recommend this series.
1439133948|3.0|This way likely lay spoilers, you are warned...    I'm conflicted on the stars to give this book. I was reading the e-version I purchased from Baen and made it to about 97%, when the plot seemed resolved, and put it away when my ride arrived. I was later awestruck by that last 3% and it changed my view of the book.     In the most general terms I can use...this reads like a series finale. It may or may not  be (I haven't seen anything definitive) but it's different from the other Vorkosigan books. Namely, life has progressed since we last saw Miles. He and Ekaterin have more children. Gregor has children. All the Koudelkas, save Mark and Kareen, seem to have children. Yet, aside from Miles wanting to get home, none of this is addressed too heavily. We have another Miles adventure, far from home and cobbling together a team, aided by his genius ability to recognize genius,to battle the threat to the Imperium.     In a way, I was reminded of Lillian Jackson Braun's \\"Cat Who...\\" books. Eventually they stopped being murder mysteries in a quirky town and were instead dispatches from a quirky town, about what the locals were up to, with a murder thrown into the background. I never really saw the threat to the Imperium as major, although once that was resolved and it became personal, I could see a lot more of why Miles was involved. Overall, though...this was an update on where Miles was in life, leading up to the final chapter(s), hitting home how the boy from \\"Warrior's Apprentice\\" was now the grown man and adult.     As for the end...Bujold's strength has always been in the emotional resonance of her characters, and the short pieces from five POVs nailed it. I wish we'd heard more from some of those people in the book, of course, but That Idiot Ivan must have his own tasks now.     So...as a standalone? Maybe three stars. As a capstone and (potential) end to the series? Four-plus.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a fan of Enders Game, I was hopeful that this trilogy would stand up well to similar works of science fiction, and I was definitely not disappointed. While certainly not light in subject matter, and with some areas where the heroine's \\"choices\\" and reasoning rang a bit on the annoying side (a little Bella from Meyers work); overall it was an enjoyable, tension packed adventure.
B0040T7CFS|2.0|All may not be as it appears.  Should you buy this, or any Brilliant box set, you must check, before doing anything else, that you received everything that was advertised.  I failed to do so on a prior version of this product and, long after the purchase date (it takes a long time to listen to so many discs, I discovered that I was shorted 15 discs.  Too late for me, but hopefully not for you.

076115678X|5.0|After seeing Lorraine Massey on The Doctors, I immediately sought out her book and then immediately put her care suggestions in place.<br /><br />I, surprisingly, didn't find shampoo the hardest thing to give up - it was my comb! Even now, even though I SEE the results, sometimes, I just want to comb my hair!!<br /><br />I have recommended this book to all my curly friends - AND, even more importantly, my friends with curly kids.<br />I wish my mother had this book when I was growing up, so I could've known how to care for my hair from day one.<br /><br />One other plus: this book is an easy read. It doesn't feel like an instruction manual, or a how-to book. It feels like a friend giving you tips for how you could do things easier and better.<br /><br />It's just a win on so many levels!
0385738757|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I liked the Mazer Runner alot.  I liked this book a LOT more.  I have to skip over some of the really gross parts, but this book was action packed!  I would have to say, I thought the first book was way more graphic.  There were little instances in this book that I thought was gross.  Because of this, I don't think I will recommend this to my 10 year old boy yet but someday I know he will love it.  If you liked Hunger Games or Divergent - you might should give this a try.  Not as good but close.  The language that they use \\"klunk, crank...\\" was kind of weird to get used to and kind of silly but nothing major. Like some of the other reviewers, I kept thinking, this is just too much for these kids - but it's still a great series and I'll be reading the third book.  Can't wait!
B001MEJY8W|4.0|I am a huge fan of horror and gore films, though lately I have been unimpressed by many films of this genre. However, Martys is sheer brilliance. It isn't just the story, the gore, the music, etc. It is every aspect of this film that makes it so gut wrenchingly frightening.<br />This film doesn't rely solely on gore or torture porn, it is seriously scary and brutal to watch, but if you are a fan of horror or can appreciate film as an art form, this must be seen.

B0025KVLTC|3.0|The qualities of this album have been well-covered.  It is a classic.  I'm not writing about the content of the album, but rather to recommend all buyers avoid the \\"Brazil\\" version that I somehow got (\\"For sale in Brazil only.\\")  The remastering job on this seems to consist of making the vocals ridiculously loud at the expense of everything else.  In particular, \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (all vocals, strings disappear), \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" (all vocals, guitars disappear) and \\"Dr. Robert\\" (all vocals, backing tracks disappear) are extremely disappointing.  For some reason, some other tracks (\\"Got to Get You into My Life\\") sound fine.  There is also audible print-through in a couple spots (where the signal of spooled audio tape transfers from one layer to another), so you get to hear a \\"ghost\\" vocal a couple seconds before the real vocal begins.  This is fairly shoddy workmanship, and it makes me wonder about the quality of their source tape.  I don't know if this is unique to the \\"Brazil\\" version (I hope so!), but PLEASE make sure to avoid this one, in any event!<br /><br />Btw, I am a recording engineer, and for reference, my listening experience is with the original vinyl versions.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|everything from the color, plot, feel, cast (and their hair full of gel), clothes, set, all looks pretty artificial--the leading lady is the only thing that keeps the film, barely, together--this is a \\"vampire\\" film for teens...don't expect anything else! what a waste of money to see this film, and even more so for this film to have ever been made! it's an insult to an intelligent audience who'd think they're going to watch a new rendition of an old folktale...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Great game! Fun and worth the time to download. Start up takes a few seconds but I really enjoy playing this game.
0061537969|5.0|this is a fantastic book that not only is a story but has a life lesson with it..it is definitely a pass along book..i never wanted the book to end...i plan to re-read it eventually, it was that good and i don't normally re-read books.
0790734850|3.0|Not to `compare and despair', but Brian De Palma's film version of James Ellroy`s \\"The Black Dahlia\\" blows this out of the water as far as noir films go. And, didn't ANYONE notice that James Ellroy even praised that movie to the high heavens???! Now, about Curtis Hanson's \\"L.A. Confidential\\", I don't recall Ellroy ever uttering a word about the film version of his work. Yes, it's set in the 50's, as opposed to the 40's like \\"Dahlia\\", but this is a film that I've owned on VHS before, and had to watch it every so many months to remember what it was even about.<br /><br />And, the dialogue is bad, for a noir film, that is - except for a few words here or there, this dialogue could be in any modern film about any modern story. And the visual style just doesn't really go in the world of noir like Hanson would want it to. It is a great film. It's just that it didn't feel as 'noirish' as I feel it could have been. See Billy Wilder's \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" and then watch De Palma's adaptation of Ellroy's novel \\"The Black Dahlia\\", and you may see what I mean about the whole 'noir' thing. Now, noir is not for everyone. Some people like it to feel more glossed over like Curtis did here. But, real noir is supposed to look sullen and dark and gloomy, and over-the-top performances.<br /><br />I've just recently viewed this film, so it's fresh in my memory as I write this. The best part of noir in the film was in the movie being made in the film. Now, that was NOIR! And, that's the kind of film De Palma modeled \\"The Black Dahlia\\" on. Hanson, on the other hand creates a terrific atmosphere, and directs a very stellar cast (but I do not see why Kim Basinger won the Academy award for her role in this, for she is good, but she drolls out the same kind of 'whisper-talk acting' that makes it very hard to hear her at times, plus it is extremely nerve-jarring, like she did in \\"Final Analysis\\". And, to think that people are comparing Scarlett Johannson's great performance in \\"Dahlia\\" to hers is beyond me. Plus, where do people get that she's a femme fatale??? That description does NOT fit her character!), and weaves a wonderful story, but it just never quite feels like noir. It looks too flashy, too modern, well, like a film ABOUT a film noir story would look like, instead of going for a flat out film noir approach, like Brian De Palma dared to do with \\"The Black Dahlia\\".<br /><br />I would give this film 4 stars for the great cast (except Danny Devito, who did a great job, but was miscast in my opinion), and for the story line, but the look of the film gnawed at me several times. As a matter of fact, I would give it 5 stars for the story, but again I stress that this is NOT what film noir is supposed to look like! It is a movie that I would recommend, even highly so, but not if I were referring someone to take in a good film noir. For that, I would steer them toward \\"Double Indemnity\\", \\"The Big Sleep\\", De Palma's \\"Snake Eyes\\", the Coen Brothers' \\"Blood Simple\\", De Palma's \\"The Black Dahlia\\", Ridley Scott's sci-fi noir \\"Blade Runner\\", De Palma's \\"Obsession\\", Bryan Singer's \\"The Usual Suspects\\", \\"Bound\\", James Mangold's \\"Identity\\", or back to earlier classics like \\"Dead Ringer\\" (with Bette Davis and Karl Malden), \\"D.O.A.\\" (and I don't mean the horrendous Dennis Quaid/Meg Ryan remake), or Hitchcock's \\"Stagefright\\", \\"Shadow Of A Doubt\\", or \\"Saboteur\\".<br /><br />So, to recap, as a modern film, this is a great movie, but as film noir, I can only give it 3 stars at most. (Like \\"The Green Mile\\", a movie I love, but have trouble with because it is a period piece, yet the dialogue could be out of any modern film.)<br /><br />But, compared to any other film (especially most of the drek Hollywood keeps churning out), I would even give this film a 5 star rating. It's only because it looked too modern for a film noir set in the 50's, just sounded too modern in the dialogue and film tone. I just appreciate it more when a filmmaker is true to the era they are filming.Thank you. :>)
0425242099|5.0|This long awaited story dealing with the relationship between Hawke , alpha of the SnowDancer wolf pack and Sienna Lauren, Psy and a member of his pack does not disappoint.    Sienna has changed from a young girl who longs for Hawke from afar to a woman who will to do anything to claim her man. She even goes so far to confront Hawke about his lame excuses for keeping them apart.  She has definitely come into her own.     Hawke is fighting his demons where Sienna is concerned. Now that she is home with her pack he is constantly fighting his awareness of her. She is proving herself to be a fearless and intelligent warrior more than capable of being his match. The two parts of him want to make her his but at what cost.    The background of the story is the mounting danger of a confrontation between the bowers to be in the San Francisco area , two predatory changeling packs and their allies and a group called the pure psy.    The story is action packed and the coming together of  Hawke and Sienna phenomenal.    I let this story flow into me and savored every moment.

B00275EHJG|4.0|This latest installment of the Toy Story trilogy more or less teaches about life. How people grow up and lose their beloved childhood toys, give them up to other children in need, or even yes, throw some of them out. We've all been there.     In this movie, Andy has grown up and moves on to go to college. An outcome any parent in their right mind would be proud of. With this milestone in Andy's life he has to make some sacrifices. As do every person entering the adult world has to.     The toys also have to make some sacrifices and adapt to their human owner's life. As mentioned in Toy Story 2 (there were plenty of precursors to Toy Story 3), they couldn't stop Andy from growing up. No one can stop the wheels of time.    Now, think about when people donate items to the Goodwill. Your unused items are useful to someone somewhere. Someone you know or don't know may be able to use them.      It's really surprises me that so many one star reviewers are upset that Andy gave the toys to some \\"random\\" girl.     Life isn't always friendly and movies aren't either. Disney is no exception. They're family movies so they have aspects for all ages. Adult humor to keep the older folks interested and kiddie flare.     No you don't have to give up all of  your happy memories, but Disney and Pixar were trying to teach folks about the reality of growing up. That's all.
1400049628|5.0|VERY entertaining read. I'll probably be reading over and over, because it was so entertaining.  I actually started believing it after a while of reading and had to step back and remember, ZOMBIES ARE NOT REAL!  Great book!
B00005V9HH|5.0|I've loved this film ever since it came out, I'm just now getting around to reviewing it. This is without a doubt the best film noir film released in the past two decades! Bryan Singer, working on a very low budget, delivers a high quality film that stands just as strong now as it did upon release in 1995.<br /><br />The story unfolds at a very deliberate intoxicating pace, and the characters are all so believable, even though some of them may or may not be fictional to suit what may or may not be fictional accounts of certain events in the film.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey, Gabrielle Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, Benecio Del Torres, and Chaz Palminteri turn in tour-de-force performances in this stunning crime-caper film noir masterpiece from the director of the \\"X-Men\\" trilogy (which I've yet to see), and \\"Apt Pupil\\", a classic film based on the Stephen King novella.<br /><br />The only other performance(s) from Spacey that I feel come anywhere as close to this is \\"Glengary Glenn Ross\\" and \\"American Beauty\\". Another awesome performance by Kevin Spacey is in the Clint Eastwood film classic \\"Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil\\". Awesome film! But this is his BEST in my opinion.<br /><br />And, the film is SO unique! I really wished that director Bryan Singer would have stuck with this genre instead of wasting his talent with comic book films.<br />He could have been the OTHER great director named Bryan alongside the likes of Brian De Palma, but with the small difference in name spelling.<br />Too bad more films like this don't get made more often!<br /><br />The story is so twisted and convoluted that at film's end, you're still left wondering WHO IS Keyser Soze?. Even when you think you have a grasp on things and have everything figured out (even after the film's final twist), it still leaves the viewer reeling, not really sure if they have figured out just WHO the real Keyse Soze is or not, if there even is a Keyser Soze.<br /><br />And, that is how great film noir is supposed to work. Think \\"The Big Sleep\\", a story so twisted that allegedly the screenwriter didn't even know who 'done it' at the film's end. This is definitely a five star film (I would rate it higher if Amazon allowed such, giving it a ten or higher) that any film buff should add to their collection. I know that I am glad to own this modern day masterpiece. Comparable in some ways to John Carpenter's \\"In The Mouth of Madness' in that it spirals and twists into an ending that will leave you utterly breathless.<br /><br />This film isn't for everyone, but it's definitely for me. My cup of tea. This is a film that will still be talked about in another ten years from now.<br />Thank you.\\", a story so twisted that allegedly the screenwriter didn't even know who 'done it' at the film's end.

B004EPYZOO|1.0|I'm into action flicks but this movie was a waste of my life. The plot was ludicrous, the acting terrible, and the special effects were even worse. The only saving grace is that Amber Heard is easy on the eyes. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I felt robbed of the $1.05 that I spent at Redbox. If you're curious, rent it.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Helpful review?  No.  Do I love this movie?  Yes.  Honestly, it's too late to write a full review right now, but I wanted to give this movie 5-stars AS SOON AS I COULD.  Loved it loved it loved it.  So if you are a 32 year old, who remembers and loves things like Smashing Pumpkins (I mean the real SP <3 before Billy was abducted by aliens), Tekken nights, 1-UP, UUDDLRLRBAStart, comic books, deadpan comedy, ninjas, kittens, then you are guaranteed to love this movie.  If you don't like any of those things above, and are not 32, then no guarentee.  Sorry.      Loved it.

B004I2K4E8|5.0|Almost perfect! I have heard other Valjeans and Alfie Bo is tops! All of the other performers really draw out the emotion, and the choirs and orchestra in this concert are mind blowing!  My one wish is that Nick Jonas had not been in the role of Marius. He has a voice that's good for pop, which explains his childhood career, but he is out of place in this strong opera style vocals, and it is a little distracting. I have seen his name on the cover of many copies in stores. Why? Why advertise him?  Aside from that, I think it kicks tail on all previous performances in print. I also own the original cast and 10th Anniversary audio CDs. The original cast recording (including the 10th anniversary) is wrecked for me because of Colm Wilkinson. Sorry, but I hate his interpretation of the music. His \\"Yip!\\" at the end of several pieces of music is a dagger to my ears.
1607882302|5.0|It was interesting to hear about Tony's personal adventures from childhood through college, although it started to get a little long and droning... but I'm really glad I stuck with it and finished the book, because there are a ton of priceless lessons included here.  I've been a customer of Zappos for a few years now and have had nothing but \\"wow\\" experiences every time I've dealt with them.  It was awesome to hear a first-hand account of how they became such an amazing company.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|Kenneth Branagh's Thor seamlessly blends the epic, sweeping mythos of the Norse gods with the effortless humor Ôdand humanity.  I've been a comic book fan for years, though never a Thor fan, but this movie is accesible and entertaining to a newcomer.    It is a rare creation story that shows the origins of both the hero and the villain, and succeeds in making both believable.  Thor and the villain, Loki, each undergo a transformation- one a redemptionø, the other a fall from grace.  Tom Hiddleston as Loki and Chris Hemsworth as Thor bring ease and naturalism to their superhuman roles.  Natalie Portman is sweet and intelligent as Jane Foster, scientist and Thor's discoverer/love interest.    Thor is what summer movies are supposed to be- fun, fresh, and grand.
0064471837|3.0|I get why a ton of people love this book. The magic system is incredibly well-developed and fairly interesting -- I may not like magic that works by a system of arbitrary rules, but I know plenty of people who read just for such things. The plot is fast-paced -- I may be tired of stories where the all of the conflict derives from the protagonist not having information that everyone else in the story has, but again, I am aware that this is simply one of my own person pet peeves. And, of course, while recent years have started remedying the defect, we have a long way to go before I start complaining about reading about too many spunky heroines, even if they're only sketchily developed.<br /><br />But there were too many little things that annoyed me about this book for me to love it, or even really like it, despite the fact that I blew through it in half a day.<br /><br />To start, while it's clear that Nix spent a lot of time developing the magic system, with its Charter Magic vs. Free Magic and bell ringing necromancy, I would have enjoyed the book more had he spent just as much time developing the rest of the world. The Old Kingdom is vaguely medieval England; Ancelstierre is vaguely early-20th century England; but neither place feels like more than a bare-bones sketch. And while Nix was apparently trying for a pseudo-England with more gender equality (Sabriel is takes classes in both fighting and etiquette at her posh all-girls boarding school, and it's clear that gender is no bar to Sabriel being respected as the Abhorsen) his imagination seemed to fail him in really extrapolating how different that world might be. So, for instance, there are still mores against unmarried men and women traveling together -- mores that include placing the blame all on the female partner -- and every person with any power Sabriel meets is male, and she's surprised when she finds a dead mage who is female. (The book passes the Bechdel Test on the strength of two half-page long conversations Sabriel has with female children.) The world is also strangely empty of people, which is all the more noticeable because of how many Dead there appear to be.<br /><br />The prose was another negative. Most of it was fine -- nothing flashy, but serviceable. But every couple chapters there would be a horribly clunky bit of exposition that totally threw me out of things. For example:<br /><br />\\"She hadn't thought beyond her own concern for her father. Now, she was beginning to expand her knowledge of him, to understand that he was more than just her father, that he was many different things to different people.\\"<br /><br />Making this hammering of the point home worse, to me at least, is that it comes after only a single incident, not after the sort of succession of conversations implied in the text.<br /><br />And while the fast-paced plot kept me turning the pages, it really cut into my appreciation of Sabriel as a character. She's traveling for weeks, but because of what I can only assume is a horror of pages of dialogue, the only time she's shown trying to figure out the puzzles set before her or interrogate the people who are clearly withholding information from her is when she's about to be interrupted by yet another attack. At one point she and two other characters spend six days at sea -- but only start to discuss their plans for when they put to shore as they're entering a harbor, so of course their conversation gets cut off. This left me with the impression that she was doing no thinking at all, just falling from one disaster into another and making it out mostly through blind luck and the deus ex machina of her father's plans.<br /><br />Still, Nix did keep me turning the pages, even if he used a trick like ending the chapters in the middle of the action scenes to do it. And the magic, particularly the bell ringing, was fascinating. And this novel was published early in his career (I think it's his second?), so it's quite likely that he improved inat least some of those areas. I wouldn't recommend against this novel, or Nix in general; it just was not strong enough for me to be excited for it. I was left feeling like I would rather have spent the time rereading Robin McKinley's [[ASIN:0441012000 The Blue Sword]].nst this novel, or Nix in general; it just was not strong enough for me to be excited for it.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|I've been flirting with a love for the Foo Fighters for a while.  I always find songs that I think are amazing, but never any albums that grab a hold of me.    Meanwhile, I couldn't stop spinning \\"Wasting Light\\".    This album is solid from end to end.  Pretty good record that I didn't get tired of spinning.  However, the album is a bit homogenous.  There isn't a lot of variance as you progress through the tracks, in my opinion.  Some songs start off like they're giving you something different, but then slip into the hard-driving Foo Fighters mold again.    If you can't get enough, then you won't be disappointed.  If you have a need for more variance, you'll probably still like it, but may prefer it on shuffle with the rest of your music.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|So I get that this film really appealed to art-minded viewer which is why I am so shocked that my mother and my cousin liked it. Usually they are not moved by the films with artistic depth.  This movie didnt go far enough for me. I understand that she was having issues, that her obsession with the art of the dance was driving her batty (or birdy) but I prefer a crazy person to be REAL CRAZY. I was left with too many questions and it would have been awsome if she really did KILL Mila Kunis' character. IDK, this just wasnt worth it to me. The sexuality didnt bother me, I notice a lot of reviewers had a problem with it and called the film pornography.  I dont know about that, but I did laugh when one viewer suggested that the scene when one of the girls was eating out of the \\"pocket book\\" of another was an artistic expression of sex as psychological (or something along those lines)  I dont know about that.  When I see Orland Bloom giving \\"dome\\" to Ashton Kutcher in a film as a expression of sex as psychological then maybe I will believe it. But IDK, most of the men that I talk to about this movie ONLY remember the scene when Portman was giving herself attention and when dinner was served in the Ballerina's bedroom.  I just would have liked to get more story and more expressions of the CRAZY and more explanation of what the crazy was. I thought the black swan dance was cool.
0060765488|5.0|This book is very fascinating. It has you see the creativity and imagination of people such as the author, C.S. Lewis and the amazing world that we live in. I think it will keep everyone who reads it interested in it. Animal lovers would definitely like this due to all of the animals in this book. Also people who like mysterious action movies would also like this book because it keeps you on your toes and there are wars and many conflicts. I would definitely recommend this book for other readers.
0451205766|4.0|Some people say the Godfather movie is a better film than the book. Some people say vice-versa. I think it's more like comparing apples and oranges.    The Godfather movie is better at being high Art with a capital A than the book is. But the book is great at being middlebrow entertainment, and is also better at fleshing out a lot of leadership lessons, motivations and Machiavellian scheming of characters because it is able to spell out their inner dialogues much more explicitly than the film.    Puzo himself said he deliberately set out to create a very mainstream, accessible middlebrow book that would sell a lot of copies, so it makes sense that as a stylist he didn't try to be fiercely lyrical and highbrow in his prose. That alone doesn't make it inferior to the film. The straightforward lack of pretentiousness is a virtue in and of itself.    The main thing is to appreciate the book for what it is, which is a well-written, brisk bestselling thriller. It also has great lessons on manhood, business, family, loyalty and other values.    Highly recommended.
1594481784|4.0|When Rob's girlfriend leaves him for his neighbor, he begins an internal journey analyzing his past relationships that leads him closer to maturity.  Rob himself is an unambitious record store owner whose life is stagnant and whose adoration of music has led him to be a snob towards those who do not share his particular taste.  Viewed as immature and unreliable by his long-term girlfriend, Laura, she breaks up with him and leaves him reeling into unexpected mourning for his childhood, past relationships, and for an idyllic romance.<br /><br />Rob is an unlikely hero, but he speaks with a candidness that lends the book a refreshing appeal.  His explanations of the internal workings of his brain are brutally honest, and the reader is likely to feel a kinship with the protagonist (no matter how much of a jerk he is at times).  Several times I was reading the book and thinking, \\"that is so true.\\"

While the story itself is somewhat tragic, it's interesting to see it all through the dog's eyes. The ending is amazing in that the second to last chapter breaks your heart, and the last chapter puts it back together again.

0385523912|5.0|Nothing to Envy is a fascinating and moving book - one of the most engrossing that I have read in a while.    Demick, a journalist for the Los Angeles Times, lives in South Korea and made nine trips to North Korea between 2001 and 2008.  She has interviewed approximately 100 North Korean defectors, most of whom are now living in South Korea or China.  In her book, Nothing to Envy, Demick chronicles the lives of six of the North Korean defectors who have since settled in South Korea.    The book is, in part, an historical account of the life of North Korean citizens under the totalitarian rule of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.  At the same time, the book is a page-turning thriller, with Demick telling the real-life survival and escape stories of each of her subjects.         I had previously wondered how this regime could effectively brainwash its entire citizenry.  In reading this book, I was astonished and mortified by the endless and all-encompassing indoctrination of the North Koreans to the propaganda message, all of which would have begun at birth.  Combined with the methods used by the regime to keep their people from acting out, including complete and total isolation from the outside world, would I know any differently if that message was literally all I knew or could know? It is a chilling thought.      I am at once, in awe and deeply saddened by the courage exhibited by each of the defectors - courage that is beyond what most people will ever have to uncover within them in their lifetime.
0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key follows two plot lines.  The first, set in Paris in July 1942, tells the fictional story of ten year-old Sarah, who is taken away with her parents in the infamous Vel' d'Hiv roundup of Jews by the French police, which really did happen at the instigation of the occupying Nazis.  As the police allow the family to gather their things, Sarah locks her younger brother in a tiny, hidden cupboard, and promises to return.  We then follow her as she is lead through different stops on the way to Auschwitz, witnessing the horrors of their confinement, the realization that she is not meant to return home slowly dawning on her.  But she is intent to keep her promise.      The second storyline is set sixty years later, about Julia Jarmond, an American living in Paris with her French husband and daughter.  She's a journalist working at an American magazine.  She is dissatisfied with her life, primarily with her chauvinistic husband.  Then she is assigned to cover the sixtieth anniversary of the Vel'd'Hiv round-up, and her research brings her into Sarah's world, and drastically changes the direction of her own life.    This is a fantastic and moving novel.  It grabs the reader immediately.  De Rosnay alternates between Sarah and Julia's stories with short, alternating chapter so we're never far away from either character.  She writes crisply, with very few digressions from these characters utterly compelling stories.  She deftly and compassionately handles the various interests in the narrative, which not only include Sarah's desire to free her brother and Julia's journey into the heart of Sarah's story, but also the French guilt over the events.  This book demonstrates how history can reverberate for decades after its written.     I thought de Rosnay's one mis-step was her characterization of Julia's husband.  He's depicted as a cad, and it's hard to fathom how Julia could have ever loved him.  Attempts to portray him empathetically are too little, too late.  Still, it's the only thing I found to fault this book.  This is definitely one to pick-up if you haven't already.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a wonderful documentary about our current financial crisis and how we got to this mess.  It is brutally honest and some parts are painful to watch.  I watched it twice (back-to-back) to get a full scope of what Charles Ferguson was trying to say.  The first time I was too ticked off to really appreciate it.  The second time (with commentary) I was able to watch it with more levelheadedness and lower blood pressure.  The film has great interviews with many key rogue players, many of who should be in jail but are not.  (How did Ferguson got them to talk?)  It was very sad to see Dominique Strauss-Kahn and Eliot Spitzer in their interviews -- two intelligent men who fell from the grace (with the former still under investigation).  But I reserve my biggest disappointment for President Obama.  Why did he surround himself with the very people who brought so much pain to millions of Americans?  Maybe one day he'll write a book and explain the whys and the wherefores of his action.  Right now, I'm just trying to shake off this sense of betrayal.<br /><br />This film touched a personal nerve with me.  In the early 80's, I was working for a large corporation.  I was offered a position to join an admin staff of a new financial product called \\"The Interest Rate Swap\\".  My job was to monitor and maintain the trades as they came in.  In the beginning, it was easy enough - there were only handful of trades.  But then the business picked up, and the trades became more and more complicated.  The product became known as \\"The Derivatives\\" and it was VERY profitable.  We all got bonuses, not just the management and the traders, but the support staff as well (albeit not in the astronomical number they got!)  We never questioned the inherent risk involved with the trades.  Why should we?  People who had PhD's were developing the product.  The company merged and I was laid off.  It's almost 10 years now.  Interesting enough, a few days ago, while cleaning my closet, I came across a box from those days -- glossy brochures explaining the complicated financial instruments to potential customers.  I threw the box in the trash where it belonged.<br /><br />I digressed -- back to the DVD.  This is a great film but remember that it's a documentary and not a movie.

My only concern is the threads to attach to any tripod are plastic and will probably wear out over time.  I've encountered this before with another specialized mount and it is not hard to glue a metal nut into it.

1589949811|1.0|... but not much else, this is the game for you!<br /><br />This is a very clunky, overcomplicated, time-and-money sucking black hole, wrapped in the form of a half empty box, attractively illustrated cards, sturdy cardboard pieces, and semi-ambiguous rules, all for the standard price of $40.<br /><br />Basically, this core set comes with one \\"player\\" starter deck (consisting of your equipment, abilities and allies) for each of the four \\"spheres of influence\\" (leadership, lore, spirit, and tactics) along with three heroes for each deck.  These heroes are the lynchpin of the game as they produce the resources required to play almost all other cards, much of the willpower needed for questing, as well as determine the amount of threat each player starts with.  If all heroes are slain, the players lose the game.  There are three quests (of three steps each) to choose from included in this set.  The chosen scenario will determine which enemies, locations and events will comprise the \\"encounter deck\\" to oppose the players.  Finally, there is a pile of punch-out tokens (wounds, quest progress and resources) as well as two threat trackers.<br /><br />To begin the game, the players determine which quest they will attempt, which \\"player\\" decks they want to use, and the number of associated heroes they will field (1-3).  Each player sets their threat tracker to equal the cost of the heroes they have chosen.  The encounter deck is assembled and the staging area is arranged using instructions on the quest cards.  The players draw six cards from their decks and begin play.<br /><br />As best I could figure it, the \\"flow\\" of the game is broken into seven phases:<br /><br />1.  Resource - Each player draws a card and puts a resource token on each of their heroes.<br />2.  Planning - Players use resource tokens to play allies and equipment.<br />3.  Quest - Players exhaust (tap) any heroes and allies they want to send on the quest.  One card is drawn from the encounter deck for each player, and placed in the staging area.  Players compare the combined willpower of all characters committed to the quest against the total threat represented by the location and enemy cards in the staging area.  If willpower is higher, progress tokens are placed on the quest.  If threat is higher, the players are \\"driven back,\\" and increase their threat trackers.<br />4.  Travel - Players can travel to a location from the staging area.  This is done to eliminate location cards and reduce the amount of threat while questing.  Any progress tokens that might be earned are placed on the active location instead of the quest card.  Only one location can be active at a time.<br />5.  Encounter - Players compare the threat requirement of each enemy in the staging area to their threat trackers.  If a player's threat tracker is high enough, enemies are assigned to that player.  Players can also voluntarily engage enemies during this phase.<br />6.  Combat - Enemies attack whichever players they are assigned to, and always attack first.  An encounter card is placed face down near each attacker.  Players can choose to exhaust a character to defend against an attacking enemy or leave it undefended.  The face down encounter card is turned over, and the \\"shadow effect\\" written on that card is applied.  Enemy damage is compared to character defense with the difference being applied to the character in the form of wound tokens.  Players may then exhaust any remaining characters (the ones that are still alive and not already tapped from questing and defending) to attack the enemies, again by comparing attack and defense and applying wound tokens.<br />7.  Refresh - All characters are readied (untapped) and each player's threat trackers are ticked up one point.  Phase 1 begins again.<br /><br />For my first game, my brother and I selected the \\"lore\\" and \\"tactic\\" decks for the \\"Journey through Mirkwood\\" quest.  We decided to use two heroes each to try to keep our threat down, but thisseriously restricted our resources, and therefore willpower, which while preventing enemies from coming after us, made the game achingly slow and allowed the threat to pile up to unmanageable levels very quickly.  (I had the extreme \\"misfortune\\" of drawing equipment and abilities for about 6 turns, with no allies in hand and no way to draw more cards.)  We ended up getting a large pile of location cards in the staging area, with which we had no way of dealing, as we had no way of overcoming the threat level, and therefore not progressing.  We were slowly able to overcome this, or rather work around this, by having Legolas kill enemies, gaining our progress tokens almost solely through his special ability.  First impressions are pretty important, and in this case, the experience was very dreary, boring, and overall a waste of time.<br /><br />Some specific complaints / recommendations with / for the game:<br /><br />1.  As important as they are, the heroes are a bit on the weak side.  Needing to tap them for just about everything (aside from collecting resources?) tends to leave you pretty short-handed.  They are only twice as durable as your allies in most occasions, which often tend to be one hit blockers.<br /><br />2.  Combat needs some serious adjustment:<br />a.  For often being expert woodsmen, warriors and archers, your characters aren't very clever or stealthy.  Always letting the enemies go first may be the \\"gentlemanly\\" thing to do, but it doesn't make much sense.  If you voluntarily engage with an enemy that could not normally have attacked you, why does it still get the first swing?  \\"Your cunning wood elf archer sees an unwary forest spider in the next clearing.  With a loud battle cry, he bravely charges the beast without any weapons drawn.  The spider bites him while he waits for a nearby ally to strike the vicious fiend.\\"  Brilliant!<br />b.  In defending yourself, are you really not going to be swinging back at the enemy?  Why would the attacker and defender not be damaging eachother during the scuffle?  This would greatly simplify combat if everyone exchanged damage at the same time, not to mention speed the game up.<br />c.  As a co-op game, where your party is generally in the same location, why can your teammates not help you fight your enemies?  If I'm getting attacked by some orcs, and my friends are just standing off to the side, because they \\"aren't engaged\\" with that enemy, I know who I'm going to be going after when I finish with the orcs.  Don't throw random perks at me!  Get in here and start chopping them up!<br /><br />3.  Locations make the game drag because they rely on the same function as the main quest.  Getting too many locations in the staging area will basically kill your ability to quest.  Maybe allow some other way to complete locations than requiring all your progress go to that card, like killing a certain amount of enemies, spending resources, discard cards, etc.<br /><br />4.  Rather than selling a \\"core set\\" for as much as a full-priced game with lots of little expansions released later, at least fill up the box.  Give us our money's worth, FFG!<br /><br />Personally, this is one I will be off-loading as soon as possible.power, which while preventing enemies from coming after us, made the game achingly slow and allowed the threat to pile up to unmanageable levels very quickly.

Don't throw random perks at me!  Get in here and start chopping them up!    3.  Locations make the game drag because they rely on the same function as the main quest.  Getting too many locations in the staging area will basically kill your ability to quest.  Maybe allow some other way to complete locations than requiring all your progress go to that card, like killing a certain amount of enemies, spending resources, discard cards, etc.    4.  Rather than selling a \\"core set\\" for as much as a full-priced game with lots of little expansions released later, at least fill up the box.  Give us our money's worth, FFG!      Personally, this is one I will be off-loading as soon as possible.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I don't feel that war is ever a reason to just wantonly murder.  But war is war and unfortunately civilians are killed in war no matter what country you have war in.  Look at all the civilians who were killed in 9-11.  I personally agree with Lutrell about all these bleeding heart Liberals.  Let's send them out there to the front lines and see if they are so brave with their own lives on the line.  Let's win the war and get out of there...we can----you know!  There are always those people in country that are good people that are caught in a war.  It would be the same if the war was here in the USA.  It doesn't and won't change......war is war.  And you must fight to win or pay a huge price in civilian and military lives.....in whatever country. Loved this book and love the great American soldiers who are willing to give their lives for our freedom.  THANK YOU,GUYS!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is freaking awesome and so much fun! My only complaint is that whenever the phone sleeps the app has to load all over again. Or if ur battery is low and that &quot;please plug in charger&quot; message pops up it does the same thing. Otherwise this game is awesome!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Most sci-fi and horror movies/TV series are done so poorly that when one is actually done well, it is a matter wothy of note. Most are written poorly. The acting is bad. They are cheaply and quickly done with little thought or worthwhile content. They are made badly from start to finish and they are completly forgettable.<br /><br />The Walking Dead has been a welcome departure from this formulaic mediocrity. The writing is crisp and it flows fast. The actors and actresses are taking their craft seriously. It is supurbly well directed. What they have done is set out to make a quality product and they have hit a home run.<br /><br />The Walking Dead set ratings records. They did it by creating a quality product and approaching their subject matter seriously.<br /><br />This should be an object lesson to other production companies: if you make it well, they will come. They will reward you at the box office and clammor for season 2.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|throughout ths story i had a smile plastered on my face and that rarely happens when i read a book.  this was such a wonderfully romantic story and i wish there were more like it out there.   i honestly wish this would become a movie.  it is a story that never ever drags and i cant get the smileoff my face.  awesome awesome story!
B003F5WOEC|5.0|The Black Keys made their name making low-fi, DIY music with a minimalism not completely dissimilar than the early White Stripes work.  Brothers is an amazing change in direction.  You get the essence of the Black Keys, but with more instrumentation, whilst retaining the characteristic nod to music styles gone by.  The album is more produced, but the producers (Dangermouse among them) have done a great job of retaining that raw bluesy edge to Dan Auerbach's voice whilst elevating it to somewhere else.  It definitely feels less of the cuff and \\"done in one take\\" compared to The Black Key's Earlier works.  Purists would be upset, but musicians have to be challenged by what they are making.  I think the guys have done this well without alienating their oldest followers.    The vinyl release of this is superb, it's worth paying for the wax, you can hear the \\"real\\" instrument aspect of the music, things like the sound of fingers running up and down strings.  The Modus Operandi of the Black Keys also suits the retro aspect of owning your music on a 12 inch disc, with the black, white and red cover art really standing out.
0091857023|2.0|I did like using the E.A.S.Y routine, it helped my fussy baby become much happier and more well rested, and I liked the pages about what the baby's different body language means.    However, I would advise ignoring all feeding advice. First of all, she treats bottlefeeding and breastfeeding as if they have an equal number of pros and cons. Then she insists that you must feed your baby only with one breast at a time or else they won't get enough fattening hind milk. So not true--not once have I read this in another book or heard this from a lactation consultant. She also thinks you can just \\"feed the baby more\\" at a feeding if they have a growth spurt, so you don't have to mess up the schedule. In actuality, you need to feed a baby more frequently for a couple days in order to make more milk--you can't just \\"give them more from the other side.\\" Also, she assumes you want to wean your baby a.s.a.p. once you start solids, and she has you replacing breastfeedings with solid feedings way to fast. This is not good advice for anyone wanting to breastfeed for a whole year or beyond. I'm glad I didn't get this book till my daughter was 2 months old, after I had breastfeeding well established and had read enough from actual breastfeeding experts to ignore all her feeding advice. I would recommend pretty much any other baby book for breastfeeding advice. And if you're into scheduling, the newest edition of Babywise actually has surprisingly sound lactation advice.
B003DZX44I|5.0|AN EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE TO SHARE THAT MOMENT WITH THE FAMILIY (ALREADY GROWN)  AND REMEMBER THEIR MOVIES WHEN THEY WERE CHILDS.
B004ZZITEU|1.0|Was it brain damage, insanity or just being completely out of though with their fan base that led to the creation of this abomination? We'll probably never know. One thing is for certain, Morbid Angel has \\"lost it\\" and is adrift in a quagmire of their own making. Between the infantile, chest thumping, lyrics that come \\"cut and pasted\\" from any generic hip-hop record, the banal out of place industrial / techno elements, to the utter lack of enthusiasm evident in the metal sounding songs this album fails to provide any positive aspect.   Between Immolation and Deicide, Morbid Angel were one of my favorite death metal bands. Sadly the use of past tense was necessary and correct. I harbor feelings of betrayal, shame and disgust just like I do towards Metallica for their sell-out, cash grab attitudes. What is truly sickening, as with Metallica, is that it casts an emotional stain that hangs like a putrid miasma when listening to their back catalog. You know that the old material that you're currently listening to is excellent and written with talent and dedication but you can not force the ugly image out of your mind of what the once great project has now become in the present.
0679735259|4.0|This is a great read about the mental anguish of war.  Not only is the writing descriptive of the surroundings but you feel the emotional attachment of the soldiers to each other and you feel the fear that they live with during operations.  Absolutely great read to help understand the viet Nam war experience.
B004BLTNM0|4.0|Well, as always it seems, I do things backwards. I watched the 2010 remake [[ASIN:B0041KKYCY I Spit on Your Grave]] before I watched this original 1978 \\"I Spit on Your Grave - Day of the Woman.\\"  I'm glad I watched both - they both have their strengths.<br /><br />I don't think either are the type of movies you ENJOY.  You experience them at a visceral level.<br /><br />I was very impressed with this version. The cinematography was superb - clear, wonderful color, interesting perspectives. There was no background musical score and I think that added a lot to the movie - you could hear every sound and the silences added to the drama.<br /><br />There was more nudity in this version - male and female; much more solely physical rape scenes - I can definitely understand the NR rating, ESPECIALLY for 1978. An extra on the DVD for this version is a discussion with the director, Meir Zarchi, which was enlightening.<br /><br />The 2011 version had much more of a psychological/emotional buildup to the rapes, which added to the scare factor. And the revenge sequence in the newer movie was much more brutal. Also, I thought the part of Matthew was much better played in the newer version, not such a caricature of a mentally troubled young man.<br /><br />The stories aren't exactly alike but both are very good, for the genre they are. Both actresses playing Jennifer Hills - Camille Keaton (1978) and Sarah Butler (2010) did outstanding jobs.<br /><br />Both versions deserve their NR ratings - these are not movies for anyone but adult - and a LOT of adults won't want to be watching them either.  They are hard movies to watch, especially for women I think.
0061128562|5.0|This came just as described, on time, and delivered what I had hoped for.  We had fun reading the book to my niece and leaving her with some fun ways to enjoy the book alone.

Looks like there is so much extra stuff on this set, I will be glued to my blu-ray player for a while.  Thanks for releasing this anthology set !!
0345529057|5.0|The books are Great, and the price is wonderful! Unless you're a collector and are looking for a set to last a lifetime, these are a nice set of 'readers'. The covers are a bit thinner than usual, but They're still durable enough for many readings in not abused. Well worth the money spent!
0061353248|5.0|A revealing look into our psyche and how we make buying decisions which are usually highly irrational. Recounts countless fascinating studies. Highly entertaining. This is a must read for anyone who ever sells, buys or knows someone who does.
1593082649|4.0|I like this book. But I'm biased. I love Jane Austen. If you are new to her works, read 'Pride and Prejudice.' If you want to start with something shorter, read 'Persuasion.' But if you've already read and enjoyed those, then what are you waiting for? Paperbacks of classic literature are so cheap.

B004UXUSIM|4.0|***1/2<br /><br />Woody Allen is a cyclical filmmaker - he follows a good film with a string of unforgettable and just plain bad films that he doesn't seem to have his heart in. Given he consistently churns out one or two films a year, this leaves a lot of celluloid for his fans to slog through to get to the gems. I used to be a devoted fan and would happily sit through the more 'trying' films. But a few years ago, the balance shifted. He used to make two or three enjoyable films followed by a mediocre film. Now, he might make a good movie and follow this with three, four, five bad films. When I started consistently sitting through a fifth dud, I gave up. A filmmaker who once was one of my favorites is now relegated to catch-it-on-DVD status.<br /><br />Allen's newest film, \\"Midnight in Paris\\", starring Owen Wilson (Danger, Will Robinson. DANGER!), Rachel McAdams, Kathy Bates, Adrian Brody and Michael Sheen, got a lot of good pre-release buzz, so I decided to give it a try and headed to the theater.<br /><br />Allen has made some interesting casting choices, using a wide range of actors to play the leading man in his films, the role he would normally play, but has moved away from in recent years. Kenneth Branagh, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johannson, Larry David, Josh Brolin, to name a few. It is a strange mix and has produced uneven results. Some of these actors have played pale copies of Allen's persona; others have ventured to create something new. So, I wasn't thrilled to learn Owen Wilson was his latest choice. I have enjoyed very few of Wilson's films and it doesn't appear to be a good match. Allen's dialogue, his writing style, is very distinctive and I couldn't imagine Wilson making it work.<br /><br />\\"Midnight\\" opens with a montage of beauty shots of Paris. This sequence is enough to make anyone who has been to the City of Light, anyone who has read about the City of Light, or anyone who has any desire to see the City of Light swoon. These portraits will make your yearning increase ten fold. Allen and his cinematographer Darius Khonji (\\"Seven\\", \\"Panic Room\\") capture every famous location, every famous street and neighborhood, painting each in sepia tones, giving us a romantic snapshot of each, as though they are taking us on an exclusive, inclusive walking tour.<br /><br />After this introduction, we meet Gil (Wilson) and his fianc&eacute;e, Inez (McAdams) who have joined her parents on a mostly-business trip to Paris. Gil is like a child in a candy shop and can't stop talking about all of the reasons he loves the city. He even tells his future wife he wants to drop his career as a screenwriter, move from Pasadena to Paris, and work on his unfinished novel. A walk in the rain wouldn't be bad either. Inez can't wait to return home and seems annoyed by Gil's dreams. Then, they run into Paul (Michael Sheen) and his wife, Carol (Nina Aranda). The old friends invite the second couple to join them for some sightseeing. Inez is fascinated by know-it-all Paul and is grateful to tag along. But Gil is bored and breaks away, he simply wants to walk the streets and soak up the culture, the ambiance. He quickly gets lost and at the stroke of midnight, an old limo drives up and the man in the back beckons Gil to join them. Gil climbs in and meets F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston, Loki in \\"Thor\\") and his wife, Zelda (Allison Pill). They attend a party and Gil soon meets Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll, TV's \\"Law & Order: LA\\"), Salvador Dali (Adrian Brody), Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and Picasso's newest muse, Adrianna (Marion Cotillard). Naturally, Gil loves this world and the daylight hours in the present become more trying.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is far from the greatness of \\"Annie Hall\\", \\"Manhattan\\", \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" or \\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\", but it has some moments. Allen's love of Paris and the era Gil escapes to is both obvious and infectious. When Gil talks about his love of the city, his desire to walk in the rain, to tour museums, to sit at sidewalk cafes, this is Allen talking, using this character to tell us his feelings. And Wilson does a good job of portraying Gil's love. When he first enters this other world with the Fitzgeralds, he does so in a way we can believe. He doesn't rub his eyes in an exaggerated way; he remains silent taking everything in. When he finally realizes this is no joke, he just goes with it. Would Hemingway agree to look at his book? No, but Hemingway wants Getrude Stein to read it. She agrees. Gil can hardly believe his luck. The next night, he is prepared, holding a copy of his unfinished manuscript when the clock strikes twelve.<br /><br />With each new introduction, he becomes more and more comfortable and wanders into a restaurant where he meets Man Ray, Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali. And as he becomes more comfortable with these people, Gil begins to utter little asides to each of the famous people, giving them hints to a future work they will create. These are funny moments, especially when the famous writer or painter doesn't get it, doesn't believe what Gil is saying.<br /><br />As Gil spends more time in this world, he gets to know Adrianna better and their relationship blossoms in a sweet way, taking some nice turns along the way.<br /><br />Wilson actually does a pretty good job in this film. It is a quiet, understated performance for him and a nice change of pace. Not only does Wilson seem to be handling the material well, Allen's writing seems looser, allowing the actor to get a handle on the director's writing. There are fewer references to psychotherapy, neuroses and other Allen mainstays than in previous films. Gil is simply fascinated by the city and the people he meets there.<br /><br />Allen never has trouble casting his films because actors clamor to work with him. He has a huge reputation and has helped many actors achieve some of their best critical notices; Leonardo DiCaprio, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal, Hugh Jackman, Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Michael Caine, Josh Brolin and many more have all appeared in his films. And he frequently has the good fortune to cast up and coming actors, usually after they have made a critically acclaimed film or just before they hit it big. These 'unknowns' have included Scarlet Johannson, Freida Pinto, Radha Mitchell, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and others. In \\"Paris\\", Corey Stoll plays Ernest Hemingway and he is the best of the actors playing the plethora of writers, painters and artists. Currently on \\"Law & Order: Los Angeles\\", Stoll manages to capture the bravado and machismo of the famous writer in a way that also seems completely natural and right for the character. Every time Hemingway speaks, you can imagine him filing the statement away, to be used later in a potential short story or novel. It is a funny, spot-on performance.<br /><br />The problem with so many actors clamoring to appear in Allen's films is that many of these actors take on small roles, sometimes very small roles, and because they are top billed, their performance seems disappointing. In \\"Paris\\", Adrian Brody plays Salvador Dali, the famous Spanish surrealist. He has one scene with Wilson's Gil, which is funny, but it doesn't add or contribute to the story enough to make it worth the time. Ultimately, having Brody around for only five minutes is more disappointing than the laughter his brief role creates.<br /><br />Tom Hiddleston, Allison Pill and Kathy Bates are all good and they have a little more time to make their characters come alive.<br /><br />During the present day moments, Gil spends a lot of time with Inez, as he feels he should, but he is just biding his time until he hears the clock chime midnight and he can return to Paris in the 20s. It is easy to see why  - Inez is a pretty unlikable person and you have to wonder what Gil saw in her in the first place. Rachel McAdams does what she can with the role, but she is never sympatheticor even slightly likable. Allen seems to feel she needs to be completely unsympathetic to make Gil's burgeoning romance with Adriana acceptable. Why this is, I don't know. In previous films, we always felt a little something for the wife or girlfriend, felt some sympathy for them when their husbands or boyfriends started cheating on them. But Inez seems to have nothing in common with Gil, she doesn't support or share his dreams, she seems only interested in the material life, the good life, she seems to be from a whole different place altogether. Because she is such a polar opposite, she sticks out like a sore thumb and the role seems forced and unnatural.<br /><br />Allen does work in a few funny jabs at current politics because Inez's parents seem to be staunchly Conservative. These lines are funny, but will also make the film seem less universal as time passes.<br /><br />Michael Sheen is very funny as Paul, the know-it-all who everyone seems enthralled with. Everyone except Gil. He clearly can't stand Inez's old friend, yet Paul and Inez both seem oblivious to this. At one point, Paul gets into an argument with a tour guide as they stroll through a sculpture garden. Later, because Gil know has some first hand knowledge, he feels confident to debate Paul, leading to some laughs. Naturally, Inez shushes her fianc&eacute;e because she only wants to listen to Paul. But even he seems to disappear after the first half of the film, as Gil becomes more and more captivated by the romance of Paris in the 20s.<br /><br />This is the biggest fault with the film. Allen seems to have great fun introducing all of these characters and elements, but he has difficulty keeping them all going and simply abandons many to concentrate on certain aspects of the story. Maybe the director who could keep many character storylines going throughout the course of the film is gone. Maybe the director of \\"Hannah and Her Sisters\\" and \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\" is gone. I hope not.<br /><br />Later, Inez and Gil have a fight. This scene has all of the elements of a great Allen moment- we watch the couple walk back and forth into the room as they argue, it seems like they might really get to the heart of the matter between them. But Inez makes a confession, which comes out of left field. It just seems arbitrary and forced. Worse, this scene seems out of place because the dialogue abruptly changes back to 'typical Allen'. Inez and Gil begin to talk as though they have been in therapy for years. The looseness, the freshness of the rest of the movie is gone.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is an enjoyable little trifle.

B002ONC9NC|3.0|PROS  It was beautifully filmed with pretty backdrops of paris and london streets. Jenny gets to dress glamorous for a while, which is also fun to watch. She gets to grow up by realizing that a man isn't everything. I was pleasantly surprised that this movie wasn't all about sex, like i initially thought. And i think this was good because it allowed the viewer to focus on the real purpose of this movie.     *Potential spoiler for those who haven't watched the movie    CONS  I don't find it very believable, that Jenny's dad who was \\"allegedly\\" strict, fell for David's lies and allowed him to whisk his daughter away. I don't think many dads would allow their underage daughter to go out with a much older man. Therefore, it seemed like a far stretch.    CONCLUSION  It was a descent movie. Its good enough to watch once.
B004Y6MIXS|1.0|Having been impressed with the Alfa AWUS036H b/g wireless card I gave this product a shot.  At first it was performing fine but though using a signal strength monitoring program (inSSIDer) I was getting random -10dB spikes across all networks in range which gave me a clue that something was not right with the card.  The card then started to emit an annoying sound at times and when it was making that noise I would lose network connectivity.  The card also would randomly disconnect from the computer for no reason.    I thought I just had a lemon and ordered a replacement. I experienced the same issues with the replacement.    I used this product with Windows 7 64-bit.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|BRAINS.... mmmmmm....<br />Cutesy graphics and fun variety of plants and the crazy neighbor is always good for a laugh. 3 HUGE problems with the current android version.<br /><br />1. Kills battery life - might as well play this for 2 hours MAX on a fully charged Galaxy S battery. Really kills battery life and makes my phone quite hot.<br /><br />2. No saved games- when the game is interrupted and you get back to your home screen you lose any level progress. Even when you hit leave and it tells you explicitly that the game progress is saved, this is untrue. You will have to restart that level and you might have to do it handicapped... explained below.<br /><br />3. Lost upgrades and losing cash - this is a hugely frustrating thing. Buying slots and even a plant upgrade (not the ones that expire mind you) with earned coins does not always save. I have lost my 7th slot twice and my twin sunflowers twice. The rake you buy is off and on depending on if you lost that level before. Additionally I have noticed that your accrued cash is not always saved correctly either. You can be showing 3000 after a level but when you visit the shop you'll be back under 1k. What gives?<br /><br />Please take care of these problems and this game may take over my Angry birds addiction for the near future, otherwise another app doomed to failure since it won't measure up against the PC or iOS versions.

B002PAQETY|5.0|This is an excellent rock album sounding rather like all other Stereophonic pieces.  I now have 5 their albums and except for one that is very good (as far as I can recall), the other 4 are excellent and strongly recommended.  I would in particular like to emphasize the compactness and structure of the songs that always feature a nice melody and are often carried by raspy singing of Kelly Jones.  His voice, playing, and melody blend into memorable songs year-in year-out.  Kelly Jones is certainly a lynchpin of the UK scene and Stereophonics altogether are way better band that they get credit for, in particular in the US.  I do not know how their sales and popularity range in the UK/US but judging from Amazon responses and year-end `best of' lists they're not nearly as great as they deserve to be.

B004ZZITEU|1.0|When I hear this disc, I cringe for Morbid Angel like I cringe for Rebecca Black when I hear \\"Friday.\\"  Only it's worse this time because she's just some kid making a fool of herself, and this is a veteran band with lots of talent.<br /><br />The problem is NOT that it steps outside of death metal boundaries.  I listen to everything from Incantation to Radiohead to Aphex Twin to the Beatles.  I don't need music to be DM to like it, but I do need it to be good music.  That's the problem: the so-called \\"experimentation\\" on this disc is amateur and repetitive 90's industrial-101.  Out of respect for the band that brought us Covenant, I've listened to Illud 4 times now, and it's just not growing on me. The production on the disc is very good, no complaints there.<br /><br />To me, the only tracks worth repeated listening are Existo Vulgore and Nevermore.  Reviewers talk up Blades for Baal, but I think they are just latching on to it because at least it's a death metal song.  I think it's pretty mediocre.<br /><br />Even if you tolerate the music on the remaining tracks, you're going to have to deal with some really cheesy lyrics.  I realize that \\"Shub Niggurath\\" or \\"Azazel\\" are just as imaginary as \\"Destructos\\"... but c'mon.. \\"Destructos\\"??  There's a difference.  Several of the songs appear to be boasting about themselves, as is common in hip-hop circles.  Radikult specifically talks about how \\"hard core\\" and \\"radical\\" they have been since 1989, and of course there's the painfully self-referential \\"I am Morbid.\\"  You could say that hymns to Ancient Ones are a different kind of silly, but at least there is some esoteric value in that, and regardless I'd take them over the Illud material any day of the week.<br /><br />I have always thought of Morbid Angel as the band that has the technical ability to pull off the uber-extreme sections, but also has the musical sensibility to mix up the tempos and phrasing, and generally make superior music.  Add to all that the looong wait since 2003's Heretic, and you have a major, major disappointment.  For their sake, I hope they make an amazing J-album.you have a major, major disappointment.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is the most addictive game I've played in a long time! I love the levels and the challenges that are there waiting for me to find. My daughter, who's eight, loves this game as well. I loved this game so much that I've downloaded the other Angry Birds (not ad-free) so we have lots and lots of levels to solve!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|Once again Lady Gaga delivers a wide range of songs with unique lyrics in her up-beat style.  Always fun to check her out to see who or what inspired her latest songs. The two CD's will easily keep me awake on road trips.  Her CD's are never boring.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I decided to read this after my boyfriend insisted I'd like the HBO series.  I found the first episode very, very creepy and vowed never to watch the show.  Given the incredible number of five stars reviews for the book (and the somewhat reduced price of $8.99 for the Kindle version) I decided to purchase the book.  It's been a long time since I was so totally engrossed in a book.  This book has it all...drama, fantasy, violence (not my first choice) vivid imagery, romance, etc.  I couldn't put it down and very quickly caught up to the TV series.  Now that I've finished the book, I'm impressed with how closely the series follows the book but would recommend the book over the TV show.  No spoiler here...there's no way I would have guessed the book would have ended the way it did.  I look forward to reading book two in the series, but need a break from that genre.  Book two is going to be my beach book, for sure!

B003I55BIA|5.0|I got this book on Kindle a couple of days ago and couldn't stop reading. Simone Elkeles knows how to create her characters. Brittany is the perfect girl but she is not happy and really wants a different life. Alejandro is the bad boy, gang member who wants a different life. Despite their different backgrounds, they have a lot in common, and you immediately see how well they fit together.    The best part about the book was that that it continuously switches between Brittany and Alejandro's voices. One chapter is told from Brittany's point of view and the next from Alejandro's. You get under the skin of both characters, hearing their thoughts and feeling their emotions.
0312430000|4.0|I'm squeamish. I don't dig unnecessarily detailed descriptions of surgery. So this - a business book written by a surgeon - was always going to be a tough one. It analogises best practice from surgical procedure to business, legal and engineering process and so has some - necessarily, I suppose - detailed descriptions of the grisly misdeeds that can happen when you carelessly cut people open. Ick.<br /><br />A couple of anecdotes in the introduction were almost enough to put me off the book, but I boxed on. Pathetic, aren't I.<br /><br />Happily, Atul Gawande soon moves out of the Intensive Care Unit and rarely returns. In the mean time he makes some surprising and valuable observations. I was going to say they are \\"counter-intuitive\\" but, in a strange way, they do seem intuitively right. So \\"surprising\\".<br /><br />What is most surprising is that there is no paradigm-shifting reveal here: no \\"long tail\\", \\"tipping point\\", \\"black swan\\", \\"universal acid\\", or \\"wealthy network\\" which has fundamentally altered the rules of engagement in the collective enterprises we're talking about. The groundbreaking technique to which Gawande appeals for his insight is the humble checklist: not exactly Web 2.0, is it.<br /><br />My initial reaction was dismissive: I've read [[ASIN:0465043577 The Misbehavior of Markets]] and [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan]] and have been persuaded of the futility of trying to anticipate unplanned contingencies. If you can't even expect them then trying to codify for them, without at least appealing to something fancy like cloud computing or Goedel undecidability seems to commit to a cardinal error: homogeneous risk management by rote is what brought down the credit markets, after all.<br /><br />But Gawande's prescription is much more subtle than that. Far from chaining us to the mast, he says, checklists set us free. In any complex procedure, even ones requiring infinite skill and judgement, large swathes of it are, nonetheless mechanical: Before you perform an emergency tracheotomy, first wash your hands and sterilise that scalpel.<br /><br />These steps are rote. They require no judgment or intuition. But humans, as a rule, aren't good at running algorithms: we make excellent experts, but hopeless machines. We're good at improvising and exercising judgment and discretion: just the things machines *aren't* good at.<br /><br />But failure to do the easy stuff can entirely undermine even the most exquisite expertise. Having a an aide memoir to help you through the drudgery reduces the risk of that.  A properly analysed checklist can, unglamorously, save lives.<br /><br />It can even ensure that exquisite  judgement and skill is being exercised: putting in group meetings in a repeat process where all concerned have an opportunity to raise questions and hash things out.<br /><br />Not any old to-do list, of course (a checklist is something quite different). There is an art to writing an effective checklist - making it short enough to be feasible and not \\"skipped\\" but thorough enough to catch a significant portion of \\"operational error\\".<br /><br />Those involved in professional occupations which will find much surprising learning in Gawande's short book. I dare say the challenge - one which Gawande reported in his own field of medicine - will be convincing supercilious fellow practitioners to stoop to such an elementary means of improving their expert performance.<br /><br />Those who are prepared to stoop may conquer.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonst wash your hands and sterilise that scalpel.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|I enjoy this more than any other game I have on my Droid 2.  That said, there are issues: sometimes lose progress, and with multiple users doesn't go automatically back to one last used as it should.  Needs an update but mucho fun!!

B004EBT5CU|1.0|I don't understand all the hype about this artist.  My wife bought this CD and I listened with an open mind because of all the attention Adele was getting on NPR and other media outlets.  Song after song failed to impress me, however.  I finally concluded that she was not a particularly good or skilled vocalist.  She is very good at yelling, though, perhaps even in an artistic manner.  She is not Ella Fitzgerald or even Bonnie Raitt.  If you really want to hear songs sung well, try one of them.  Or Etta James.  Or Linda Rondstadt.  Or Rickie Lee Jones.  Or Nora Jones.  Or... well, you get the idea.  There's talent out there.  Don't settle for hollerin'.
B004ZZITEU|1.0|Morbid Angel may as well change their name to Fallen Angel.<br />Now!!!<br />Before any of my fellow Morbid fans crucify me for this review, let me say this.<br />I've been a fan since \\"Altars\\".<br />When I was a teen it was all about Slayer and Metallica, Megadeth and Testament, Possessed, etc...<br />Then I heard \\"A Skull Full of Maggots\\" from Cannibal Corpses \\"Eaten Back to Life\\" album.<br />Cannibal along with Deicide, Morbid Angel and Obituary turned me into a death metal head for life.<br />So it is with great sadness that I write this review...<br />Like all of you I was bummed when David Vincent left and was equally psyched when he rejoined only to wait....and wait...and wait...for the new album.<br />And wait we did fellow Morbid's...<br />Waited....for NOTHING.<br />I usually don't take this track by track but in this case it's almost a must.<br />All the complete songs are now on Youtube.<br />Here is my take on what is Morbid's \\"St. Anger\\",<br />Their \\"Unspoken King\\".<br /><br />\\"Omni Portens\\" opens the album with a cringeworthy version of \\"Doomsday Celebration\\" from \\"Blessed Are the Sick\\".<br />Feeble and worthless and embarrassing.<br />We then get to \\"Too Extreme!\\"<br />The title alone makes me want to cry.<br />We're treated to a song that sounds like a rip off of \\"Whoomp there it is\\".<br />\\"Whoomp too extreme\\"<br />\\"Whoomp too extreme\\"<br />Pathetic.<br />Up next is \\"Existo\\".<br />More like classic Morbid but utterly yawn inducing.<br />\\"Blades for Baal\\" is next and is actually quite good.<br />Not a classic Morbid tune but passable.<br />Sadly the trend of classic Morbid does NOT continue as \\"I Am Morbid\\" is up next.<br />Lyrics include...\\"I'm morbid, and sordid\\"....how poetic (insert deliberate sarcasm).<br />Another embarrassing waste of disc space.<br />Next...<br />\\"10 More Dead\\"<br />It sounds like Pantera, not really a bad thing but for Morbid Angel?<br />Just sad.<br />Did I mention how Vincent's vocals are really starting to grate on my nerves at this point?<br />And now we move on to what is possibly THE worst song the band has ever written...\\"Destructos vs. the Earth/Attack\\"<br />Going forward I will call them \\"Power Morbid 5000\\" as this is the one song from 1994 that Powerman 5000 WASN'T retarded enough to write for themselves.<br />.....March....March.....March....\\"With laser vision.\\"<br />Is this the same band that wrote \\"Eyes to see, Ears to Hear????\\"<br />Unfortunately both bodily functions appeared to have failed them as Grand Master Evil D's and DJ Trey's laser vision is clearly malfunctioning to have written such an abomination.<br />Sickening!!!<br />Next up....\\"Nevermore\\".<br />Classic Morbid and the only track worth mentioning on the whole disc....sad, we've heard this song a thousand times over the last four years.<br />\\"Beauty Meets Beast\\"....yawn.<br />No techno, no experimenting....just boring.<br />And up next...the crowning glory in a crown filled with garbage...\\"Radikult\\".<br />Easily the most revolting song ever written by any band, bar none.<br />Vincent raps...yes...raps killacop...cop...killacop.<br />Now...this may have been offensive and creative when Ice T did it with Body Count 20 years ago but now?<br />UUGH!!!<br />Words escape me as to how bad this really is.<br />We end the album with \\"Mea Culpa\\"...another tragic embarrassment.<br />It sounds like some crazy Asian video game music.<br />I apologize, that's an insult to crazy Asian video games.<br />Vincent claims...\\"I take all the blame\\"<br />Works for me dude, I blame you and DJ Trey for this insulting slap in the face that the true fans waited almost a decade for.<br />Destructhor and Tim Yeung I totally excuse as I'm sure they thought they were joining the most legendary death metal band of all time.<br />As far as I'm concerned...both of them are collateral damage, nothing more.<br /><br />So that's it folks....one of the bands that changed my life reduced to ......this.<br />I'm heartbroken.<br />My only hope is that this was a joke to thwart the music pirates and Morbid will release the REAL album later.<br />I honestly think I strained my eye rolling muscles listening to this album.<br />And to make it even worse song's like \\"Destructos\\" and \\"Radikult\\" just keep going and going and GOING.<br />Over seven minutes of annoying crap.<br />Our military may be able to use this to interrogate prisoners but I can't see anyone listening to this for pleasure.<br />Extreme is good but this is just grating.<br />I can only say I'm sorry to anyone who actually buys this album.<br />This is NOT Morbid Angel, this is a blatant cash grab at an audience that never existed for the band to start with.<br />You know what...I still have faith.<br />Kreator released a few bad albums.<br />So did Destruction.<br />Heck, even Slayer released that sonic turd called \\"Diabolous In Musica\\" and rebounded.<br />Hopefully Morbid will listen to the outcry from fans and critics alike, unlike Metallica...before releasing four more albums that stink before getting their act together.<br />\\"Illud Divinum Insanus\\"????<br />Pathetic.<br />Embarrassing.<br />One of the WORST albums ever written, bar none.<br />Recommended???<br />You've got to be joking???<br />AAAAAAAVOID!!!!!!worse song's like \\"Destructos\\" and \\"Radikult\\" just keep going and going and GOING.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Its the same great game as seen on the iPhone, but it feels like an imperfect port from the iOS to the Android. The obvious imperfection is the resolution being a little low and stretched.  The game takes a little while to initially load and to resume after switching between apps or coming from the screen lock. Sporadically and somewhat rarely the game will slow down and become unresponsive. The only way out is to unplug the battery and restart the phone. Very annoying. Otherwise the game runs great for long periods of time.  AT&amp;T Samsung Captivate Froyo
0307269752|5.0|I loved the book, it was great and definitely worth the buy. it took a little while to get to where i live but other than that it was in awesome condition and a very nice book to read
B004DM0UII|5.0|Out of all of the internet streaming apps out there, this is the one that's not only a great fit for me, but also performs great.  you see, I was spoiled by Pocket Tunes, an app I had on my old Palm os PDA, and my internet streaming app quest for Android had to include certain features.  I had to have a sleep timer, I had to be able to add and modify an assortment of streams, had to play in the background, not a memory hog, good customer support, active program updates.  That shouldn't be too hard to find, those things, it is.  XiiaLive matches beautifully.<br /><br />Not only did I get what I needed, but also some really cool features I hadn't even thought of like the little alert sounds, which are extremely informative in the dark.  I listen to audio streams while nodding off to sleep so when it has to buffer or I drop connection, I don't have to physically look to see what happened.  I very rarely drop connection, but when I reconnect, I love the ball drop sound upon connection.<br /><br />I'm sure this app does more than I'm telling you, but for me, this is the best one and I'm picky.
0439023483|5.0|I was soo suprised that i liked this book.    I started reading this book a while ago, and i stopped at about 50 pages, and i kinda forgot about it.    Yesterday i decided to continue, because some of my friends told me that it gets soo much better.    They were soo right!    I read about 300 pages last night because I couldnt put it down, and i finished the whole book (I was up until 4 in the morning)    You have to read it!    I'm officially addicted :)

B003N5VOUO|3.0|It's Bollywood's answer to Forrest Gump, and it's very affecting and entertaining.  But here are the two biggest objections:    1.  After 9/11, San Francisco is depicted as a nest of seething, right-wing bigotry where Muslims are shunned at candlelight vigils and backyard barbecues, where well-groomed whites never miss an opportunity to taunt, bully, or beat a Muslim, where Muslim shops are vandalized and ransacked, and where angry Anglos tear burqas off of Muslim women.  This nightmare vision does not accurately portray any corner of America after 9/11, least of all San Francisco.      2.  The scenes in Georgia will make you roll your eyes.  The portrayal of the blacks who live there, especially the massive Aunt Jemima figure and her Buckwheat son who breaks spontaneously into song, is sentimental and patronizing.
B004LWZW42|4.0|- Hank McCoy (while fitting the experimental Cerebro device on Charles Xavier's head): \\"Are you sure we can't shave your head?\\"<br />- Charles Xavier: \\"Don't touch my hair.\\"<br /><br />This movie, X-MEN: FIRST CLASS, extends a bold middle finger to the X-Men's comic book continuity, and I didn't mind it too much; that's how much I liked it. FIRST CLASS is the prequel, but it feels like a reboot. Taking place mostly in the early '60s and set in the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis, it chronicles the gestation of the X-Men and the founding of Charles Xavier's school. Even more strongly, it tracks the friendship (and its inevitable dissolution) between our two central characters, visionary Professor Charles Xavier and the tormented Eric Lensherr, who in due time would terrorize the world as Magneto, Master of Magnetism. Also, Hugh Jackman cameos, Rebecca Romijn cameos, and John F. Kennedy cameos.<br /><br />If you can overlook the rather towering continuity breaks from the source material and, if you care about them, from the previous films, then X-MEN: FIRST CLASS is solid viewing. Me, I've had to shift perspective over the years, had to separate the comic book from its movie adaptation, because the two aren't necessarily the same thing. They, in fact, mostly aren't. Still, the fan boy in me is royally miffed that Banshee is portrayed as neither Irish nor an adult.<br /><br />But maybe the biggest veer away from the original mythos is that, here, Xavier and Mystique meet during childhood and grow up to be adopted brother and sister. That's an intense kick in the crotch, and demonstrates right away that director Matthew Vaughn plans to shake things up. But the story begins faithfully enough in a concentration camp in Poland, 1944, as young prisoner Eric Lensherr is torn away from his parents. In his distraught state, Eric, solely with his mind, unwittingly bends the iron gate which separates him from his family. This mutant act doesn't go unnoticed, and the unfolding tragedy would shape young Lensherr's character.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in affluent Westchester, New York, young telepath Charles Xavier hones his talent and eventually fosters a dream of mutants peacefully integrating with humans. Not that humans are yet aware of mutants, or as they'd fondly call them in the future: \\"Stinking muties.\\" In 1962, Xavier is distracted from his hitting on college girls (using that unfailingly sexy science banter of his) by Moira MacTaggert, a CIA operative (yes, a CIA operative! And not Scottish!) who's sniffed out a possible threat to world peace and needs Xavier's expertise in mutation. In the course of investigating this threat - fleshed out by the Hellfire Club - Xavier meets Eric Lensherr, an obsessed gent intent on tracking the German what murdered his mother. Surprisingly, Charles and Eric strike up a friendship.<br /><br />Kevin Bacon, by starring in a movie with such a sprawling cast, gives more chances for people to play the Six Degress of Kevin Bacon, so he's got that going for him. Bacon plays the clear cut bad guy, as opposed to Michael Fassbender's ambivalent bad guy (or is it anti-hero? You certainly cheer for him enough). Bacon plays Sebastian Shaw, the mutant leader of the Hellfire Club who has the ability to absorb energy and then project it in nasty ways. I haven't seen Kevin Bacon in a lot of movies. While watching him as Shaw, I still halfway expected him to bust out dancing in defiance of some small town law. I will say that he's pretty damn effective early in the film when he was playing the creepy German (Shaw's previous incarnation). In 1962, in full-on James Bond villain mode, Shaw means to instigate World War III. Ergo, the ensuing game of missile musical chair.<br /><br />James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender's performances and chemistry together are the reason to watch this film. McAvoy manages to infuse surprising charm into the stodgy Prof. X, and it's a hell of a hoot watching him mack on the ladies. As Magneto, Fassbender makes you forget about Ian McKellen. Fassbender is younger and more virile and he transforms Eric Lensherr into a three-dimensional character. His thirst for revenge and his belief that mutants are superior to mankind clash with Xavier's dream of co-existence, and yet there's enough humanity left in Eric that Xavier believes him salvageable. This conflict in philosophy is what ultimately drives their relationship and this movie. When the Cerebro device allows Xavier to sense other mutants on a global scale, he and Magneto don't waste time in seeking them out and recruiting them, but for different purposes. Xavier is excited to meet them for the sake of meeting them and to welcome them. Eric is more practical. He knows he and Xavier will need their own army to combat the Hellfire Club and to achieve Eric's own ends.<br /><br />If X-MEN FIRST CLASS isn't as good as X2, well, it's almost as. A lot of things happen, but the narrative keeps events from getting confusing. With an abundance of characters, it's natural for some of them to feel the pinch, to not get adequate treatment or even get one line of dialogue (I'm looking at you, Azazel and Riptide). The general audience probably won't have a clue as to who most of these cats are, and so my advice is to bring a comic book geek with you, although fair warning that that geek may be too busy pulling out his hair at all the contradictions and swerves and departures. Some of these characters are really far from being canon. One thing I thought the film did really well is capture the zeitgeist of the 1960s era. I somehow expected Twiggy or Emma Peel to stroll on screen.<br /><br />I won't really quibble on the choices made for Xavier's recruits, irrespective of their proper place in X-Men history and continuity. Frankly, I'm just glad to see folks like Havok, Darwin, and Banshee get the cinematic treatment. The f/x is competent. The fighty fights are swell. The lead actors are very good. If I had one big complaint, it's how awful the Beast make-up looks. Stinkin' mutie.gneto, Fassbender makes you forget about Ian McKellen.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Very fun, addictive tower defense style game. The only issue I had is this game runs like a slideshow on my phone, Optimus V. Make sure your device has enough power!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|It has been quite fun watching how Kid Rock's music has shifted over the years.  Born Free could be my all time favorite.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|best game ive found so far.  better than game dev story too... but i love that one as well.  the roof levels could ne better though.    Updated:  I needed to shave off a star unfortunately.  I just moved to a Motorola Droid X2 and it appears the game is not optimized for the Nvidia Tegra 2.  They'll need to optimize for that CPU to get it to not slow down after each fight and pause in the middle of busy activities.  I'll update again if/when it's fixed to go back to 5 stars.  Still a great game I own on multiple platforms.  This is the only platform that seems to have problems.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|This little thing is awesome. If you don't use one of these, get one! I can't believe the difference it makes in my listening enjoyment. On headphones, or through a 3.5mm to my car stereo, this thing gives a richer sound, more bass- (lots, if you turn boost on) and a lot more volume. I used to have to turn my car stereo up pretty loud to get the volume I wanted out of my portable sources, and it would mean that I'd have to deal with some degree of electronic hiss- That's gone. Also, sometimes I like to listen to music at ridiculous, ear damaging volume- and I would turn the volume all the way up on my Ipod or tablet, and it would be loud, but not really loud... Now, with the amp-I can turn it up till it hurts... and I'm afraid to go louder... It's awesome.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Some have compared this film to \\"All the President's Men\\", which told of the travails of the intrepid reporters who unraveled the Watergate scandal.<br /><br />There's one large and tragic difference between that story and the one told in \\"Fair Game\\".  Watergate forced Richard Nixon to resign his office in disgrace.  The treasonous activities perpetrated by Bush, Cheney, and their cronies have had all but no repercussions.<br /><br />Bush now makes thousands speaking at company functions.  Cheney is about to release a book justifying his misdeeds.  And Bush commuted the sentence of the one guy who took a fall for the \\"Plamegate\\" scandal, Cheney's operative Scooter Libby.<br /><br />Make no mistake.  The story told in \\"Fair Game\\" captures one of the darkest hours in American history.  The leaders of our nation launched a war of aggression on another country, attempting to justify their actions based on the flimsiest web of false information.<br /><br />When one courageous citizen, former ambassador Joe Wilson, spoke out about the campaign of deceit waged by the White House, the White House exposed his wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA operative, and attempted to discredit the couple in a wave of lies and vitriol that lasted four long years.<br /><br />Any American, either on the right or left, who cares about \\"truth, justice, and the American way\\" should be outraged and disgusted by what went on here.  This movie does a valuable service in dramatizing and focusing a complicated story obscured in real life by the fog of disinformation into a taut hour-and-forty-five minute drama.<br /><br />This DVD also brings more to the story than the original theatrical release, because the disc includes illuminating commentary by Joe Wilson and Valerie Plame.  Their testimony gives the film a stamp of unimpeachable veracity unlike the flim flam concocted by the Bush administration in its helter-skelter runup to the Iraq War.<br /><br />Happily, the couple now seem happy and proud of their courageous actions, but they also remark how watching the film brings back some terrible recollections, especially when they see the footage the film contains of the warmongers spewing their pathetic lies on camera.<br /><br />Bush, Cheney, Peter King, Condoleeza Rice, and others should all be ashamed and shunned for the rest of their lives by all true Americans.<br /><br />The performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn as the embattled couple are impeccable, and indeed Plame and Wilson both say what accurate portrayals of themselves are on display here.<br /><br />In my opinion, this film should be required viewing by all school children here in the United States for generations to come.  And for those families whose loved ones gave the ultimate sacrifice in that unjust war, one can only feel the deepest of sympathy.ing the film brings back some terrible recollections, especially when they see the footage the film contains of the warmongers spewing their pathetic lies on camera.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|this game is a lot of fun.  enjoyed the game play and was pretty addictive for a while.<br />you can purchase various \\"plants\\" and devices to fight off zombie army of varying abilities.<br />This game is not too hard, but not too easy either.. good game balance.<br /><br />One big flaw of the game is that often times it crashes and you lose all your progress in the game.<br /><br />That's right.  you have to start from the very beginning.<br /><br />This is very discouraging when there are accumulated points and level progress.<br /><br />I beat the game once and was working towards collecting various upgrades and accomplishments.  One crash and everything was lost.  I probably won't play the game again..<br /><br />I own Samsung Fascinate.  The phone is on OS v2.2

0439023483|5.0|This book is about 12 districts that are controlled by the capital who are very bad and evil. Katniss Everdeen (main character) lives with her sister and her mom and has to work hard to take care of them with her friend gale. But every year the capital hosts a event called the hunger games. The capital takes one boy and one girl from each district and has them fight on live TV. Katniss gets in because she volunteers for her beloved sister. And Peeta who likes her gets chosen too. Throughout the games there are a lot and i mean A LOT of twists and turns. There are three books in the series and if you think the first is good well wait until you read the second if u think thats good wait till u read the third. this series is good for all ages including adults because its gory and other stuff...but I'm 12 and read it with all my friends too so its a kids book too. Once i stayed up till 11 reading : )

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I got this game when Amazon did there free deal with wifi download. I had to wait until I got home and logged into my wifi before I could download it. The download went smooth and I started playing the game in no time. I have not played other versions of this game so this review is strictly from the Android app. I have a Samsung Galaxy S from T-mobile and I never dealt with any slow-downs.<br /><br />Graphics: Exellent for a mobile app. Animation is good for each plant and zombie.<br /><br />Gamplay: Challenging levels, addictive gameplay. Great bonus levels. New items earned every level. Great final boss battle. You build up your defenses by adding plants that attack the zombies. You have to have sun to build your arsenal so the sun is like money and each item cost sun to purchase and plant. You can plant sunflowers that produce sun to add to it but they don't fight the zombies. You can plant barriers, pea shooters, fly traps, and various other weapons and upgrades (fireballs for pea shooters, multi-pea shooters, tougher barriers, etc.) There are various zombies that attack. The standard zombie, cone-head zombie, metal-head zombie, football player zombie, ladder zombie, pole-vault zombie, ice zamboni zombie, go cart zombie, old man zombie, disco zombie, jack-in-the-box zombie, and more. As you can see, there are multiple zombies you encounter that make game play challenging. You play levels in the front yard, backyard (with a swimming pool) and on the roof. You can play during the day or at night. At night, you don't get the sun bonus so you have to plant sunflowers to build your army. There are plants for water, grass, and planter pots for the roof.<br /><br />Sound: A++. If you can hear a zombie say \\"Brains,\\" need I say more.<br /><br />Replay: Good. You can purchase new items and once you finish the game, you can quick play any level. I find myself going back for more after I finished it. Love the bonus levels and you can build up your money to buy more weapons and slots.

B004LZRSBY|4.0|I enjoyed watching this vid from a-ha's goodbye tour. I was able to see them in New York City live last May 2010 and enjoyed seeing the bigger and better show they provided their fans in Oslo.    Vid and sound quality were tremendous. The extra's (even though not enough) were great.    If I had any gripe, I wish they had made a companion cd to include all their videos from over the years.     Does anyone out there know of a good blu-ray version of where I could get their vids?
0240815807|5.0|This was an excellent book. I highly recommend this book to anyone trying to learn mixing techniques or just review their work methods. It explains in detail, the use of EQ, reverb, compression (among others) and shows you different ways to get varied results using these techniques. It shows you how some of the pros are using these methods, most of all, with clear and concise examples. The writing style is entertaining and flows pretty well. Great read!
1442419814|2.0|The whole premise and plot of this book and series is very interesting. However, the narrative itself is pretty terrible. Good YA books relate to the concerns of the audience without dumbing down or being fake. Then, on the other hand, there's those condescending authors who think of teenagers like another, inferior species of animal and construct some poor and slightly insulting bad caricature of what they 'think' they are like for purpose of their books and narration.    Another problem: It's nice to show the fun activities Tally gets up to like hoverboards and rollercoasters. But some huge distracting scene of them messing around with them is suddenly dumped in as she gets distracted, whenever something critical with the plot recently happened and SHOULD be being advanced instead, and often these are near-useless or unnecessary scenes.    Seriously, the teenagers - particularly if they are 16, like the protagonist, reading this book probably don't have 'ADHD' and do NOT want to be led off on some 'distraction' about hoverboards and rollercoasters every time some critical development in the plot - a cliffhanger - demands further advancement. You'd also think Tally herself would be mature enough by now to also not be distracted away from the more pressing concerns (that risk her life!) every 5 minutes.    For a perspective, I thought Twilight was pretty mediocre and not deserving of all the accolades it got, but its narrative in terms of actually connecting to the reader and target markets is light years ahead of this. I think this book will only be non-annoying to the really young 'young adults', not ones which are the protagonists' actual ages.    Also, a good book set in a time other than the present, shows the common concerns of the character for the reader to relate to, but does seem like they do live in that imaginary other time or society. Tally seemed a bit to me like a teenager from our time suddenly sent to some weird 'summer camp' with cool technologiessince maybe a year or so previously.
067960085X|5.0|This famous, popular novella was made into the famous movie but is better than the movie. The central character, the wild centerpiece of the book, is an uninhibited, humorously amoral, histrionic woman living downstairs from the narrator, a reflective Capote like figure, in wartime New York City. Exuding hauteur, she lives poor but with a certain bohemian glamor in the urban bouloubaisse of artists, lost souls, criminals, and various colorful but rather alienated souls. She works at an ambiguous but somewhat seedy occupation--not a call girl but more as a high class persona who sells her enchanting personality as much as her body, to the various men she captures, captivates, then often discards. Actually she is a rustic from Arkansas--in the tradiation of the lost graviating to New York, and Capote takes a certain glee in her superficial attractiveness and indifferent manipulativeness. The story can be seen as humorous, or as a sort of romantic comedy, or a madcap description of Bohemian life. But it is best seen as a kind of documentary of a rootless soul, at the moment captivating, but eventually tragic, and the ascendency of appearances over substance--a kind of precious but painful aesthetic seen in the posturings of gay literature of culture before more accepted mainstream.  The story may be modeled on Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories--which is a little less romanticized in tone. But like Berlin Stories it involves non-conventional life on the brim of destruction, described by a narrator who is gay and self-supprssed because of the times. Capote's narrator is a bit less detached than Isherwoods, the story more sensational, the book frillier and less seriousminded, and probably easier to read. The book is also a protest--conveying a world where relationships are evanescent, where style triumphs over day to day matters, and where morals are intrinsically motivated rather than dictated by straight society, and life is lived in the moment.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Beside the fact that it received the Oscar for best picture, this is truly a film for adults. It's about the future King George of England who had a serious speech impediment. Because of it he hated speaking in public even though his station demanded it. He, through  his wife, sees a speech therapist -  he hates every minute of it but continues. When his brother abdicates and he becomes the next king of England he's terrified but comes through when it is demanded of him. Colin Firth's performance is amazing. Mr. Firth's diction is always correct. But to think what he had to go through to maintain the imperfect speech of the King of England is amazing. It is great film and one that should be seen by all.

0307477479|3.0|I just got done with this book, and I have to say that it was just ok. The book is made up basically of many different stories, all were intertwined, but they stood alone. Chapter 12, the famous \\"powerpoint\\" chapter was  a little strange. I am still wondering what that had to do with the rest of the book. Overall, this was just ok, not something that I would overly recommend, but something that I would not dismiss either. Quick read....<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B00005JMCN|1.0|I really didn't think this movie was watchable. I struggled through it because I was reading the book.    For one thing, Hillenbrand made Seabiscuit the most compelling character in the story: funny, ferocious, lazy, nervy, sweet... the movie totally lost sight of all that. It should have started with Seabiscuit and stuck with him. It mentions his preference for lying down and sleeping and his big appetite, but only in passing, whereas Hillenbrand weaves these and other luminous details into a portrait vivid and individual enough to rival Lassie, Old Yeller, and the like.    Also, the movie was entirely lacking in humor, unlike the book and the characters themselves - except for cliches like the radio announcer. The rest of the time, they seemed to want to make it into a sort of \\"Ken Burns' Seabiscuit.\\"    And then there were so many weird inconsistencies: like the black guy who's silent through the first 2/3rds of the movie and then suddenly starts talking.    And the sappy, intrusive music when what you want to hear is the typical loudspeaker with the racing announcer's descriptions - at least part of the time, so you feel you're actually at a racetrack.    And all that 4th grade Depression history! And the narrator carefully explaining what you know already but leaving out all the details you'd actually want a head's-up on. And the script insouciantly making dialog and events up on the fly so that you feel they had thrown the book out the window, but then inexplicably retaining details unimportant to Seabiscuit's story, like the whole history of the owner's automotive business, his divorce, and his remarriage, as well as the bordello scene (in which Toby Maguire is shown with a prostitute even though Hillenbrand said there was no evidence Red Pollard had gone to one)....    Why in the world make this into a PG-13 movie in the first place? Wouldn't it have made a better family film?     Clearly it was a difficult book to make into a script. And it's gotten great reviews. I just can't agree. I think it's painfully bad.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is excellent. Tons of fun and enough to keep you busy for a long time.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|Having seen all of the gratuitously grotesque previous filmic installments of the X-Men franchise, our family went into X-Men: First Class with reservations. How surprised we all were leaving the theater and seriously considering owning a copy when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray. This film just works.     The 1960s setting is delightful! The retro clothing is inspired and recalls a world parallel to our own with just a twist. Matthew Vaughn's alternative reality version of the Cuban Missile Crisis seems perhaps even more logical than the events that occurred in our world. And there is little cooler than the classic SR-71 Blackbird.    However, the film's stars pull it all together. Kevin Bacon, whom we haven't seen in a film in what feels like forever, is a surprisingly sinister Sebastian Shaw. Michael Fassbender plays a complex and sympathetic Magneto. Because of Penelope, all of my family has a very special place in our hearts for James McAvoy, but his performance as a young Charles Xavier is inspired and inspiring. Although perhaps not as legendary as Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart, Fassbender and McAvoy have the presence and charisma to pull off younger incarnations of their iconic characters.    This is a film that is well worth seeing with the whole family. Our ten-year-old son enjoyed it, his eleven-year-old brother wanted to see it again, and both of us had a thoroughly good time! Stop reading this review and go see X-Men: First Class.
1935251740|3.0|I was somewhat disappointed by this book. It borders too closely to pop-psychology for my taste. For example, when reading a Brian Greene book about Cosmology there are many references and a thick Appendix. There is none of that here. There are many assertions, not really backed up by much proof. A number of concepts are presented (none really new), and interpreted to show that consciousness is at the core of explaining them. It is unfortunate because I think consciousness probably has a solid role to play in understanding the universe, but the authors don't have much core proof, so they end up postulating and hypothesizing quite a bit. There isn't a way to test much of what they are saying. Probably the most interesting \\"hard\\" proof comes in about 2-3 pages when they discuss Benjamin Libet's research on conscious decision-making.    The book is also interspersed with what I thought were weird digressions about Dr. Lanza's education and achievements. They almost seem put there to either placate the author's ego or to prove to the reader that Dr. Lanza is credible. Name dropping \\"I worked with B.F. Skinner...\\" is quite prevalent. This is somewhat offputting as you almost feel Dr. Lanza is trying too hard to prove something: most scientists of a certain caliber don't need to \\"market\\" their achievements to readers. There is also a lot of fluff in between the main concepts. Just overall soft on the science, and hard on non-analytical hypotheses.    That saying, this book will introduce the reader to an alternate viewpoint that probably has some relevance. Just take it for what it is - an interesting but somewhat light discussion on the universe and cosmos that is missing much solid to grasp onto.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|This is probably the worst movie in recent memory. Bad acting, bad story. I have zero hope that Zack Snyder will pull off a good Superman movie after seeing this one. Not even worth a rental. I don't understand how you can accidentally make such a bad movie.
B00005JLKN|5.0|With three big names in this movie I received what I expected, which was amazing performances. This movie focuses on Ed Norton's relationship with Anthony Hopkins (who played Hannibal Lector) Lector uses his knowledge to help Ed catch a serial killer, who Ed soon realizes in Lector. After Lector's failed murder attempt on Ed's character, Will Graham (Edward Norton) is once again called to investigate s new series of murders perpetrated by \\"The Toothfairy\\" played by Ralph Fiennes. But what Will did not expect was to seek the help of an old acquaintance of his, Hannibal Lector.<br /><br />This film plays with the dark relationship between both of these characters and the FBI is racing to stop this serial killer before he kills again or before he vanishes into the shadows like so many others. We also get to see the surly behavior of \\"The Toothfairy\\" and how he did choose to kill, but through years of torture, was forced to kill.<br /><br />There is not a moment in this movie where I am not enjoying something new.

B0041CGP02|1.0|Enough has been said, and quite rightly, on the BJ delusion. Mr. Jon Bongiovi, the CEO of a corporation and running a brand for 20 years (by his own admission), the outrageous concert ticket ripoff prices carefuly aimed at the needs of the working soccer moms, well not really! (USD 1,000 for a seat), the insulting irrelevance of new releases of old albums with a couple of extra tracks thrown in when you can find far better (an free) bootlegs out there on Youtube, the utter redundancy of these Best of... projects, no to mention their crazy band dynamics revolving around a authoritarian, iron fist, front man who after 25 years still treats band members as office boys, etc. Why all this, the fans will ask? Well, here is my two cents: Firstly, it is money coupled with dried out creativity and lack of musical principle. When you become what you dreamed of becoming, the dream is over. It is a vicious Circle (like the last tour). You need to become maisntream to continue to exist, and in the process the danger is becoming something else. Rock stars turn into laid back millionaires and fans become mere customers. Granted, in showbiz you may need to sell a few million units of commercial projects every now and again to bring in cash and survive. The problem is when you do not turn in a single worthwile thing in between!!! Take Eric Clapton, for example. If one wants a long career, you obviously need to explore other genres, pop, rock and roll, country, etc, periodically. He always claimed his first and only love is the blues, so, in between popish or mixed albums, once in a while he delivered a pure blues gem, he could afford to do it, and the surprise is that it was also a commercial success. In the 90s, while pop, rap and grunge attracted millions, EC was touring the world just playing blues standards to sold out venues! This to me is an inequivocal sign that something more fundamental has changed in the case of Bon Jovi Inc. Richie Sambora has produced zero worthwhile stuff since his first solo piece, and so has the BJ corporation. David Bryan is the only exception. BJ is his day job and in the meantime he has been working hard at writing musicals, quite succesfully, by the way. So, if this band would come up with a, say, Circle album, to grab some cash, and then deliver something like Keep the Faith or These Days, every now and again, you could think \\"they still have it\\". Sadly, when those true projects fail to appear, one realizes something is fundamentally wrong. The second thing and perhaps linked to this Jon Bongiovi lost his voice for good after the These Days record. He could still deliver the goods after the Keep the Faith comeback. Check for instance, the rendition of \\"Keep the Faith\\" in the great live concert An Evening with Bon Jovi, or the excellent cover from The Animals \\"We gotta get out of this place\\" from the same gig. Mr. Bongiovi can´t sing any more, so the tracks they produced lack the sparkle, the power and the intensity of their glory days. My take is that this Circle Tour may well mark the end of the band. JBJ is trying to grab as much money as he can with a two year long stretch at outrageous prices and will probably call it a day after the tour is done. Want al this better said, listen to the track \\"Last Man Standing\\". It is about them. An subconsciously autobiographical song.
B001K98MFU|5.0|If you enjoy the Ghost in the Shell series, I highly recommend the Blue Ray of GITS 2: Innocence.   This movie is a visually and audio stunning and it would only improve your enjoyment to view the movie in the highest definition you can, so the Blue Ray of this movie is much more better than the regular DVD,  not only visually, but also offers English dub audio that the DVD does not.  I do find it strange that the Blue Ray I have contains two different English dubs. An English 5.1 Bandai Entertainment Dub, like you hear on the other Bandai GITS series DVDs and there is also an English 5.1 Manga UK Dub, which seems to be set at a lower octave and the voices and everything else sound deeper.  Why they did this, I do not know.  Then of course there is the Japanese audio.  This Blue Ray is out of production at the moment and the reason for the high price.  I almost bought it for $39 a year ago and thought I would wait and see if the price would go down on sale before I bought it.  I can kick myself in the butt for not buying it then.  I used a gift card to bring the price down lower. I understand if many people cannot afford to buy at over $80, but if you can afford it and a fan of GITS, then it may be worth it or you can hope it goes back into production at a lower price someday.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The first book of the Hunger Games kept me reading.  There is a lot of interest toward post-apocalyptic subjects right now and this is an extension of that.  It is a cross between the TV show Survivor, the book 1984, and the good old days of real live Gladiators.  It is pretty straight forward, and in the thriller or action/adventure vein.  Don't look for artful or insightful writing, but clean action sequences and heart-string-pulling passages. I found myself routing for the protagonist and you know exactly who that is all the way in this one--even if there is a bit of suspense and doubt about her supporters and allies.  The bad guys never really come onstage, as they are the ever-present but unseen government body... even if other unfortunates are there to present certain dangers or even death.  Great summer read for the beach.  I would say it is fitting for 15 or older.  I would give it a 3.5 if I could.
B004SEUJKU|5.0|Comment: Well I think we all get the story of the original Terminator by now... so what makes this Blue-ray different than what came before besides the book. It looks like they obtained the best print they could and cleaned it up. I am no film expert but I have heard that \\"cheap\\" film for low budget films from that time left a lot to be desired. Based on that it appears they have done a good job... so much so that you have no problem seeing Arnold's full frontal as he runs to the camera at the start of the movie. The film grain is apparent and you can see the model work and rear screen projection quite clearly if you know what to look for. Is it ground breaking re-mastery? No. But I think with the book and some extras with a little sweetening of the picture it may be worthwhile to add to your collection... at least till they release the 4k 60 frames per second 3D version...

Wolverine origins is the equivalent of jaws 4 in the way of how they decided to screw up a franchise in the name of greed. If I could, I'd give this movie 0 out of 5. Unacceptable.
1439107955|5.0|Dr Mukherjee has written a fascinating history of how human beings have tried to cope with cancer from pre-history to the early 21st Century.  The clinician and the layperson alike will find this book very graspable and enriching.  What stood out to me is that the extremely wily genetic nature of cancer makes total cure almost impossible except in a small subset of types and patients, but that prevention is a much easier and more successful approach.  Mukherjee devotes many pages to the avoidable evils of tobacco.  Missing, I thought, were similar discussions of obesity, alcohol, paucity of vegetables and fruit in one's diet, high sugar content in diet, and lack of exercise.  Attention to these will also contribute massively to prevention of malignancies.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|One of the rare cases in which the sequel is better than the original, but looking back at the first movie you realize that Singer could only go up from that point on.<br />They managed to incorporate all of these characters and yet give 'em all something cool to do. Not only the movie has a lot of action and cool special effects but it also brought back that metaphor of prejudice and placed it two steps further. Very reminiscent of post 9-11 and the vibe around the time in which it was filmed. Highly recommended.
B000E5N6LG|4.0|To me, Kevin Costner has always been a bit wooden in his acting. But, you know what? He sure knows how to select the right movies to act in. Just look at his track record with such hits as Dances with Wolves, For the Love of the Game, Field of Dreams, etc. And Wyatt Earp is no different. This movie came to the theaters the same time as Kurt Russell's Tombstone, and I saw both on the big screen. Russell, I felt was much better and Tombstone was clearly superior, but there was something about Costner's character development that kept me glued. It's a wonderful version of a longtime yarn and he carries off the job of recreating Wyatt Earp marvelously. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wishes to see beyond just the OK Corral gunfight, and into Earp's younger and more formative years. How Wyatt came to be Wyatt. The ensemble actors Costner surrounds himself with are perfect for their parts while the scenery is beautiful and music score fitting. Good movie. Way to go, Kevin!!
B000AYELVA|5.0|This movie is responsible for spawning the super hero movie craze and also for turning me into an avid x-men fan. I absolutely love and praise how well this movie was adapted to the real world and the new millennium. I know most fans don't like how a lot of things were changed but I don't think it would have been as effective a movie had it been loyal to the original comics (see watchmen). The movie is not perfect but it is revolutionary, before this movie super heroes were silly, stupid and exclusive to kids but now the characters are brought to adult situations and everybody can relate to them.<br /><br />If you are into men in tights and bright underwear worn over them, this might not be the movie for you.
B004ZZITEU|1.0|Count me in as one of the people that have been not only gravely disappointed, but downright revolted by this album.<br /><br />Since the rather mediocre [[ASIN:B0000C506V Heretic]], we would hope that after an anticipated eight year wait that we would get an album that showed us that it was still the band we held in high regard. Of course, I didn't expect it to be at the same level as their masterpieces, but I sure didn't expect it to be at this level. The band has officially made the aforementioned Heretic look masterful in comparison.<br /><br />While tracks like \\"Blades of Baal\\", \\"Existo Vulgor&eacute;\\" and \\"Nevermore\\" are by far the better material on here (despite them being rather average), it still doesn't make up for the remainder one bit. Throughout this album, we are left with haphazardly constructed songs that mindlessly throw in electronic and 10th rate industrial metal to try to make it sound like they're experimenting. That's not going to fly this time. To go from highly complex, well-written songs with classical undertones to repetitive, dance hall rhythm based trash like \\"Too Extreme!\\" and \\"Destructos vs. the Earth\\" shows that over this waiting period, primary songwriter Trey Azagthoth has lost his mind. Out of all the songwriters in death metal, why him? Let's not forget that David Vincent's vocals have taken a turn for the far worse, sounding like he recorded them straight after a 24 hour chain smoking session.<br /><br />This isn't Morbid Angel. This is the result of what happens when death metal veterans feel the need to betray their fan base by using the trademark name to pass off their insipid wankery. Maybe this is all a sick joke, but whether they're playing games with us or not, this should be boycotted by all means necessary.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|It is a great movie for the whole family. My kids have watched many times and everytime they watch it they really enjoy it.
B004MKM8L8|4.0|WATCHING 3 KIDS GOING CAMPING IN HD IS A TERRIFIC  EXPERIENCE.  TRULY BRINGS THE MOVIE INTO NEAR REALITY.  GREAT MOVIE SERIES TO BEGIN WITH.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|The best way to view the bands final concert (other than being in Oslo last Dec. 4) is on blu-ray.  While the NTSC dvd in the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" is extremely poor quality and is missing the documentary and photo gallery, the blu-ray looks sharp and has both extras.  I just wish the blu-ray came in an edition (like the dvd) with the 2 cds included.
B003UESJH4|5.0|After seeing this movie twice, I knew I had to own it.  The Academy Awards was correct to give this movie the awards it did.  I felt the movie should have been awarded best supporting actor as well but held commenting  until I saw The Fighter to decide which actor should have received the Oscar.  I go with my original opinion.  Geoffrey Rush should have won.  I recommend watching earlier films with Colin Firth so that one can see what a fine actor he is and not just in The King's Speech.   If you have not watch Valmont, I highly recommend it.  Colin Firth can act in anything he wants to and shine.
B001IF252C|5.0|Works perfectly. I read many reviews and had some flicker concerns. I paid much less though this vendor an it arrived in Apple packaging brand new for far less than apples price of 199.00
1442337966|4.0|I really enjoyed and was inspired by the simplicity of the message in this CD set. Having watched the DVD 'The Secret' and felt there was a missing element, this does seem to fill the gap.  I was not impressed by the sound effects in the background,e.g. 'someone crying''someone laughing'; but I loved the music and singing, especially at the end!  Well worth listening to, again and again.
0240810961|4.0|When I received my review copies in the mail (it is a two-volume set), I was very excited to get a closer look at them. I reviewed Don Hahn's previous work, The Alchemy of Animation, and thoroughly enjoyed it. With Don's history of award-winning animation, it is very obvious that he has a passion for animation and for mentoring new animators.<br /><br />Walt Stanchfield (1919-2000) spent the bulk of his professional career at the Walt Disney Studios. Before Disney, he spent time at the Charles Mintz Studio and the Walter Lantz Studio. At Disney, he had a hand in every animated feature from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad to The Great Mouse Detective. In the 1970s, Stanchfield and Eric Larson started a training program for the new breed of animators: Bird, Bluth, Clements, Dejas, Keane, Lasseter, Musker and many more of Disney's best modern animators. Stanchfield began compiling his notes from the weekly classes in the 1980s, these handwritten notes were passed among the animators that created the Disney films of the second Golden Age (The Little Mermaid - The Lion King). Don and his talented team (including Dee Stanchfield) transcribed over a thousand pages of notes. Included is illustrative artwork from Stanchfield and renowned Disney artists from the past 80 years.<br /><br />I am not an animator. If left to my own devices, I can muster a passing face or a simple drawing of a still life--a very still life. My review of this book is based on my love of animated films and the Walt Disney Company. At a cursory glance, this work is a must for any serious animation student. Once you delve deeper into the individual sections, you realize that you are learning about the process of animation and the details of bringing lines and drawings to life. You are also discovering an artist as he shares a lifetime of experiences with students and artistic disciples.<br /><br />The images of the pages I have posted are how the book is represented. Sketches and drawings permeate the text and bring the words to life. You can see the techniques jump from the page and a true sense is related on how animation works--and why Disney animation has always worked so well. The section headings are representative of the animation process: Basics, Gesture, Seeing, Analysis, Creativity and Thinking. Not only will you gain invaluable artistic skill from following Stanchfield's lessons, but you will learn the intricacies of emotion and life in the animated form. Spending any time with this book will give you a deeper appreciation of animation as an art form.<br /><br />In the foreword, Don sums up the work perfectly:<br /><br />  Drawn To Life is one of the strongest primers on animation ever written. The material spares no detail on the craft of animation, but also digs deep into the artistic roots of the medium.<br /><br />I reiterate--this book is a must for animators of any caliber.<br /><br />This book reminds me of the Tao of Jeet Kune Do by Bruce Lee. It is an incredible work for martial art students to study and learn new techniques to deepen their skills. It is also a valuable work for fans of Bruce Lee and readers interested in broadening their understanding of the human body and what can be attained.<br /><br />Drawn To Life is a master work on animation. Imagine sitting at the feet of a master as he pours forth on animation, life and philosophy. That Hahn has presented Stanchfield's work to us--and that we can hold it in our hands--is amazing. This is a two-volume set that should be on every animator's shelf, dog-eared, thumbed-through and within reach for serious study and joyful glimpses of life.e words to life.

B001CDLATE|5.0|The film itself is great.  Fricke manages to keep your attention throughout the viewing experience with lush visuals and amazing sound.  The 8K transfer really shows it's quality on this disc, and then some.  The DTS-HD track is solid, as well, with great directional mixing and a perfectly crafted score that fits the film like a glove.  I'd never actually seen \\"Baraka\\" before my first Blu-Ray viewing of it several months back via Netflix.  A friend referred me and described it as being the kind of must-have title when you really want to see just how good your home theater can perform in a visual sense.  He wasn't kidding!  I was plenty skeptical when he told me the length of the feature and that there wasn't any dialogue and figured it'd be a miracle if I made it past the 10-minute mark.  I was proven wrong in a big way.      I originally watched the film using our Optoma HD66 720p projector onto a 120\\" screen.  It looked awesome in that viewing, so I was surprised that during our most recent viewing (after our own copy arrived via Amazon) using our new Epson 8350 projector that I was impressed further.  Anyone who has a home theater system owes it to themselves (and their system!) to spin this flick at least once (and in my case repeatedly). The detail is frighteningly clear and it not only seems as though the film was shot yesterday, but also that it's actually happening right there in front of you.  Certainly some of the most vivid 2D imagery I've ever laid my eyes on.  Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|needs alot of clean up to do. graphic is squashed, looks fat. can't prevent shutting down when phone sleeps and app is still on. very limited compared to the desktop version, less plants and zombies, less quick games and no personal garden. overall gameplay is ok but feels cheated of graphic and options.
B000000OQF|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. An album that will be heard for ever and ever since it has really catchy and amazing songs. If you like hard rock then this is the bible. Welcome to the jungle - Its so easy - Paradise city - My Michelle - Sweet child o mine. What can we say about these tracks? They are cool upbeat easy - listening - and they will last for evr. A must buy for anyone.
1591841666|5.0|A delightful little book (literally, about 5 1/4\\" x 7 1/4\\" and 80 pages of text), Seth calls it \\"a little book that teaches you when to quit (and when to stick).\\" According to Godin, you are always faced (in business and in life) with one of three situations: 1) a Dip, which he describes as \\"the long slog between starting and mastery, 2) the Cul-de-sac, really a dead end that will never get any better, and 3) a Cliff, the rarest of situations where you cannot quit until you fall off the ledge. Knowing the difference is what creates extraordinary results. He shares the secret to this on page 4: \\"Quit the wrong stuff. Stick with the right stuff. Have the guts to do one or the other.\\" Citing examples throughout this practical tome (you could easily read it at one sitting), he provides three key questions to ask before quitting: 1) Am I panicking? 2) Who am I trying to influence? and 3) What sort of measurable progress am I making?<br /><br />Ever the pragmatist, Godin closes with a collection of additional questions to press the reader into action. Even if the action is to quit something (not always a bad thing)!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These headphones are awesome. In a word, they are comfortable. They adjust to your head size, unlike most headphones where you have to set the ear length manually.  One note they are semi-open which means they don't block out external noise. I wouldn't call it a negative, just something to be aware of, they wouldn't be good on an airplane for example.
0425242099|5.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this book since the release date was publicized and in fact drove my fiance insane with wanting to check multiple stores every day for a week before the release just to see if was out early...every so often it happens! While I didn't get it early, I did snatch it up on the actual day ;)    Lots of people have described the plot so I will just say it was fantastic. I loved Sienna and Hawke's story (even if I did want to smack Hawke for being stubborn more than once!) and I especially loved Walker and Lara's story, although I kinda hope Lara doesn't take Walker's last name because Lara Lauren just sounds weird haha.    Anyway, this was very well written and likely one of my favorites, which considering I read between 3-6 books a week is saying quite a lot. After reading it through the first time, I immediately began rereading it. For someone who has trouble reading a book straight through (I tend to skip around a lot for some reason), rereading immediately straight through is practically a miracle for me. Nalini Singh has without a doubt earned her place as one of my top authors because there has not been a single book I haven't fallen in love with.     I will say that if you haven't read the other novels in the Psy-Changeling series, you will likely be confused as hell about the background and the approaching war. She does use a lot of secondary characters but manages to give them voices without overdoing it. The love story between Hawke and Sienna is stand alone but you definitely will want the context of the previous books to get the most out of this.
0439023483|5.0|My girls both raved about this book.  And I like to encourage their reading.  So, I caved and dug in.  (Despite, the teenage audience, female main character, and female author.  Yes...sexist.)    This book was really good.  Great characters.  Great story.  Great storytelling.  Excellent pace.
B003GK212G|2.0|This book book is not something I would recommend. I would have given it one star, but it was saved by one of the two main plots. That half of the plot was good. The writing in this book is not good. Usually I don't really think about those things, but here the poor writing and cliches are all over the place. Too bad, because I liked the characters from the previous books.
B000000W5N|4.0|Heard this in a record store and when the original of \\"Sweet Jane\\" came on, almost passed out. These guys, there's just no words for that level of talent and incredible song writing.

031261246X|5.0|I work in the IT field and I am studing cyber security.  I first discovered the book while listening to Steve Gibson's Security Now podcast, I went and bought the e-book and after reading through the e-book plan on buying the hardcover just so I can have it grace the presance of my bookshelf.  It is by-far the best technothriller I have read and is extremely technology accurate.  I hope to see more from thei author!
1442419814|5.0|I bought the book after a friend push me at a book store and it is not a book I normally would buy.  The title and the cover put me off but this turned out to be a great example of do not judge a book by its cover.<br />I loved the book and could not put it down once I started reading it.  The story just kept me hooked. End up having to buy the rest of the book so I could get the rest of the story.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|i like the game play and the concept of the game. That beginning said, this game will often freeze my phone. Based on discussions with others it seems it is an issue specific to the vibrant.
B003Z6QGGS|5.0|I'm a Megadeth fan, and maybe I'm a little biased. However, reading Dave Mustaine's memoirs on the flight from Tokyo to Zurich, while having a Megadeth anthology rockin' my headphones, made the experience of reading this book a 11 out of 10. I don't agree with everything Dave did in his life and with certain attitudes. I'm not even sure that I like him as a person. Nevertheless, this is a must-read for anyone who likes a good story about sex, drugs and rock'n'roll.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|I never really paid much attention to Lady Gaga. I overheard this album earlier this week over a friend's house, and went out a bought it the next day. There are some *extremely* innovative things going on in this record, and if you dig below the dance beats, there are songs that were written from the ground up and not patched together in the studio, like a lot of dance music. Her vocals are truly inspiring, and for anyone that thinks Lady Gaga is a Madonna knockoff, consider Gaga's musical background. I don't believe she is pandering to a gay audience, because the songs are too good. At 45 years old, I don't hear much music anymore that I would call \\"innovative\\", but this album knocks my socks off. Bravo!

B004EPYZOO|5.0|Will Drive Angry win a Best Picture Oscar? I hope not.  Did this movie touch my inner humanity, causing me to expand my intellectual and emotional horizon? If it did, I didn't notice.  But as an avid movie goer, did Drive Angry meet or exceed my expectations? Absolutely.      Drive Angry has all the following characteristics of a B-Movie:     1.) Nicholas Cage is in it.   2.) A very attractive Amber Heard displays a delightful quantity of cleavage and leg on the movie poster.   3.) The title is reminiscent of Golden Age pulp fiction.   4.) The plot involves a backwoods cult, the Devil's emissary, and an escapee from Hell.      When you're awake at 2:00 in the morning and fending off sobriety, this is the kind of movie you hope to find on Cinemax or HBO.  Unfortunately, while many B-Movies sound full of promise, their entertainment value ultimately collapses under the weight of bad acting, a low budget, a very annoying script, and even more annoying plot holes and dialog.  Does Drive Angry have these same shortcomings? Sure.  Did they stop the movie from being entertaining? Hell no! Do I have too many rhetorical questions in an Amazon movie review? Of course.    While Drive Angry is no Evil Dead or Army of Darkness, it's the most recent movie I've seen, that captures the heart and feel of that genre for many years.  Plus, you get to see Nicholas Cage drink beer from a skull.  Five Stars!
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|This book takes off like the Concord, for the first half you'll enjoy one of the most exciting fast paced adventure stories ever written. Then for some unknown reason it runs out of energy.  I read the first half in a day including most of the night.  Then the book took a turn and in the wrong direction.  I still encourage everyone to read this book! But when it gets sluggish walk away happy with the fantastic ride you had until that point.  It took me a long time to finish this book.. I kept hoping \\"it was going to come back\\".  Let me save you that little bit of misery, it won't.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|I've never played the pc version, so I can't compare.  This version is very fun.  I've read that it doesn't have all the same features, which would help the over all experience I guess.  My problem with the game is that its lagy at times.  I am using a vibrant, and I've deleted and made sure it wasnt my phone.  It doesn't do it all the time, but when it does, it makes the game unplayable.  Also, I've made it to level 3~5 twice, and my game save disappears.  I hate having to start over before I beat the game.  Funny thing is, it saves the name I put in, but nothing else.  Please fix.
B002KREVCO|3.0|I am a huge Bon Scott AC/DC fan and was not at all impressed with this set.  I had a lot of the rare songs from Australian imports.  The new unreleased stuff should have stayed that way for the most part.  Hard on the ears.

B001N1DPDE|3.0|I will start by saying that I love this knife, and it is very well constructed and comes with a great sheath.  I've banged on it quite a bit now and it has held up well.  Sharpening it has proven to be a little on the long side, but it also holds its edge quite well.  It is really great at chopping, if that is your thing, and batons really well also.    I have a few problems with the knife though. For starters, the loop on the sheath is like 4 inches wide.  When you hang it on your belt it will flop around like a fish.  A little button halfway down would have been nice, otherwise you will need to sew it yourself to make it fit better.    Second, the knife is heavy like a 7\\" blade.  Which I don't mind, if I have a 7\\" blade.  Unfortunately, the blade is only 5\\".  So I am carrying a heavier knife but getting less capability with it.  While batoning, I'm usually going to be targeting 4-5\\" logs.  For this size, the knife fell a little short.  At times, just the tip was pointing out of the log and it made the job much more difficult. Around camp I felt like the knife was a little too big to use for normal tasks.  It's also way too big to be used for skinning, but definitely too small for machete type work.    So now I have a heavy, well-crafted knife, but it isn't ideally suited for batoning, camp tasks, skinning, or cutting foilage.  As another reviewer said, what is this purpose of this knife?  Going forward, I would replace it with a small folder (CRKT Lake or my Leatherman Charge blade), and get a larger knife instead (BK7, Kabar Bowie, RAT-7).  Everyone's preferences are different, but I'd rather have a small, easy to access folder for camp tasks, and a larger knife better suited for batoning.
B001TODO54|5.0|Since this book released, I have picked it up over a dozen times. The cover is just stunning. I could not just walk by it without stopping. I loved the concept and wanted to read it for a while, but just kept putting it off. I should have known that was just a silly thing to do.    I am fangirling over this book a little. I enjoyed every second of reading it and when I was doing other things, I wanted to go back to reading.    Katsa is the definition of a girl who kicks ass. There is something with names starting with Kat, because she reminded me of Katniss, but she was even tougher and deadly. Throw her into the Hunger Games bubble and no one would stand a chance!    She isn't just strong because of her Grace. She has trained, worked hard, and educated herself more than she ever needed to. She stands up against her uncle and won't allow him to use her as a tool. She stands up for the people of the world and does everything she can to help. She also will help others become stronger and teaches them how to protect themselves. She may be my favorite female character of the year.    She also sticks to what she believes in, even if it is not popular. She does not want to marry or have children. While most people scoff at her and say it will never work, she stands her ground and finds ways (and people) who respect her decisions and work with her. This makes it a very different romance with the charming, strong, and secretive Po. Everyone tries to make them something they are not, which adds another layer to the tension. It is a sweet and exciting love, but it does not take away from the action-packed book full of mystery and suspense of the rest of the book.    The idea of having a Grace was something that drew me to the book and did not disappoint. That everyone could see that who was special made it harder for all involved and added some interesting situations and conflicts. Some of the Graces were funny, shocking, or made me envious! The cooking Grace would be quite useful!    I loved every page of this book and cannot wait to read the next book!

0553386794|5.0|I really did not think I was going to like this book. But I picked it up anyway due to my sister's insistence that I read it. When I first started the book, I had a hard time keeping all of the characters straight, and was ready to give up on it. I'm so glad I didn't! Three days (and two sleepless nights) later I finished the book, and can't wait for number 2 to get here through the mail. Completely worth a read.

B002NXPTDK|5.0|Kudi is the most talented rapper out there. His beats are original, his lyrics speak to me. This album was a breath of fresh air and hopefully is a sign of a shift from the same tired rap that's out there right now.
B004N66XYE|5.0|The clever idea of upstairs/downstairs always amazes me. It is a wonderful watch. If you like this \\"type\\" movie, buy it, you'll like it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|THIS A GREAT GAME, VERY ADDICTIVE!! I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY I LEFY MY BB FOR AN ANDROID BUT NO I  DO..PLANTS VS. ZOMBIES IS THE BEST GAME YET!!!
0743497465|1.0|This book is terrible. Shallow characters, twists just for twist's sake. Even the science and hardware are pretty boring. Just feels like he mailed it in.
0316098329|5.0|If you had to, how would you raise a child alone to the age of 5 in one locked room?<br /><br />\\"Room\\" explores the story of a little boy growing up in confinement. It's an astonishing tale told from his viewpoint, completely believable and amazingly well written.<br /><br />I started reading it at bedtime last night and read the first chapter, then got up early today and read the rest straight through for five hours. Couldn't put it down, and not just because it was overdue at the library. I was prepared to pay big fines.<br /><br />Intelligent little Jack is a bright penny of a character, but it was his mother I found extraordinary. Her inventiveness, imagination and care under the worst circumstances makes me wish I'd been a much more attentive and engaged parent (dare I say, maybe even to the point of being isolated with my kids their first five years). \\"Room\\" will make you wonder what's worse: being cooped up or being let out.<br /><br />This book is a gripping read, hugely compelling for anyone with a heart and especially meaningful for parents.
0307272702|5.0|Great book.     Finally someone compiled the science, looked at the body of existing knowledge and realized that the columns did not add up.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|THE SHOW IS AMAZING.. VIDEO AND AUDIO SO CRISP AND CLEAR.. THANK YOU DAVID ..I HOPE YOU CONTINUE TO PRODUCE MORE OF THESE KIND OF SHOW.
0756665949|3.0|I love Lost. And I love all of the symbolism surrounding it. And my sister loves the show as much, or more, than I do. I thought this would be the perfect xmas gift for her. Once I received it I had to check it out before I wrapped it for her. I was a bit disappointed. I am not really sure what I was expecting but it seems a little cheesy. Also most of the information in the book I pretty much knew from friends and watching the commentary. It is a huge book, but I paid almost $50 and wasn't too thrilled. I guess I will just stick to the show and hope my sister actually looks at it.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I live in Thailand which is so far from the US, but the CD still arrived far earlier than estimated date without any scratch! Thank you very much Amazon!
B000I2J76I|1.0|Tried playing this DVD in 5 different players (yes, all HD) but it wouldn't play. The disc itself looked like it had been burned and damaged - had a cloudy effect on 1/2 of it.
B0051QIGP4|3.0|Marry The Night - Great way to start things off. This should've easily been a single released as I could totally imagine it being played at nightclub venues. Why Judas was released and not this is mind boggling.    Bloody Mary - I really enjoyed the melody of this.    Bad Kids - Really catchy song.    Highway Unicorn - My favorite song on the CD because it has everything you need to know about Lady Gaga.    Heavy Mental Lover - I know some people don't like this song, but it has a calming effect to me for some reason whenever I get pissed off so I like to drive around while playing it because I won't be angry anymore.    Electric Chapel - I love the pace of this.    You & I - feels like a throwback to her previous songs of Again Again, Brown Eyes, and Speechless where she let her vocals and the lyrics speak for themselves rather relying on a catchy beat like most artists tend to do. I could really feel her soul in this. To me, this song was Vintage Gaga.     The Edge of Glory - Its the final song on the album and fittingly so and as it truly feels like her curtain call track. She could give up right now on making music and it would be a great way to end her career on much like how \\"Let It Be\\" was for the Beatles, but what really sold me on the song was the use of the saxophone. I'm a huge fan of jazz and I went absolutely nuts the first time I heard it play. Its a seriously underrated music genre and I hope there will more jazz fans now thanks to Gaga's influence.    The other half of the songs I omitted I couldn't get into either felt like filler, had awful beats or lyrics, or I feel like Lady Gaga phoned some of them in. I was hoping Born This Way would be as good as her last two albums. Unfortunately, I can't help, but feel disappointed by the third act of the Gaga trilogy.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|All of the Harry Potter DVD's I've received from Amazon.Com have been great products.  I gladly add this one to my   collection of all the Harry Potter movies.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this game! it's runs smooth on the droids2. one of the best games I have played so far its easy to control yet the game itself can get challenging
0811879542|5.0|This book is irresistibly compelling and utterly captivating.  It opens with a single yellow dot in the middle of the page with the instructions, \\"Press here and turn the page.\\"  Now, even though you are a rational adult human being who knows that pressing the yellow dot will have absolutely no effect, you find yourself doing it anyway.<br /><br />And whey you press the dot and turn the page you find - voila! - two dots.  Then three.  And if you rub the dots, they change colors.  Then tap them to get more of each color.  Next, shake the book - just a little - and see what happens.  Now shake it a little more.  And so the book continues with page after delightful page of things to do to make the dots do things.<br /><br />This book is absolutely captivating for adults, doubly so for children.  My four-year-old daughter howls with laughter every time she \\"makes\\" the dots do something.  And I caught her staying up late, shaking and tilting the book.  It is especially exciting on the first read-through, as kids anticipate what will happen as a result of each action.  But even once they know what will happen, the book retains its attraction.  There's a sense of mastery and power as kids \\"control\\" the dots.<br /><br />Fair warning, however:  I'd suggest buying this one online.  You might find yourself feeling rather foolish at the library or bookstore when you notice everyone staring at you as you press, tap, shake, tilt and blow on the book.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|this is easily one of the worst movies ever made.  the person who compared it to watching a sibling play a video game for an hour is accurate except i would add that its like watching an unusually boring video game.  I saw this in the theater and it felt like an extra long trip to the dentist, except more uncomfortable.  Maybe like having a dental procedure while getting a colonoscopy at the same time?  It felt like it went on for about 6 hours and was incredibly boring and stupid.  The only good thing about this movie was the sense of relief i felt when it ended.   If i had not been there with a group of people, i would have left after the first half hour.  I dont understand how so many people could watch the same movie i did and give it 4 or 5 stars.
B0026P40NU|1.0|Irritatingly contrived w/ a lack of emotional truth (big loud external emotions and declarations are constant; range of emotions and exchanges are absent).    Not much feeling for the arts and artists depicted, so I'm unclear what the impulse to make the series was.  I'd never recommend this dvd set.
B003UESJ9M|3.0|This movie was okay but a little on the slow side. Gweneth Paltro was definitely not the main person in this movie. It was the other girl. Much better actress. Overall all not a bad movie for country fans.
0307887960|5.0|I actually just started it and on my 4th day of the Attack Phase and I've lost 4lbs. I did the Atkins diet several years ago and lost 40lbs and kept it off for years. I love reading this book and the way the diet is designed. It incorporates vegetables and other items sooner which is better. Its definitely a better way to learn to eat long term as well.

1401230423|4.0|Morpheus of the Endless has had many trials throughout the ages... but none quite as strange as the one he must face in \\"The Sandman, Volume Four: Season of Mists.\\" The fourth collection of Neil Gaiman's classic Sandman series centers on sudden changes in the world of Hell, and the terrifying choice that the Lord of Dreams must make -- who does it go to?<br /><br />After a disastrous meeting with the other Endless, Morpheus goes to Hell to set free his onetime lover, Nada. But when he gets there, he finds that Lucifer is tired of being the lord of Hell, and is shutting the whole place down -- and he gives ownership of it to Morpheus. In the meantime, the souls of the damned are roaming Earth, and the anguished demons have nowhere to go.<br /><br />Morpheus isn't interested in ruling Hell, so soon various powers appear to claim Hell -- Norse, Japanese and Egyptian gods, a trio of powerful demons, Order, Chaos, a Faerie diplomat, and a pair of angels are sent to watch the proceedings. Threats, bribes and tricks ensue, leaving Morpheus with a seemingly-impossible choice to make.<br /><br />Just a warning: This comic book, despite its brilliant storytelling, left me with a sort of squirmy feeling, because it bases itself on Christian theology that many people actually believe in (heaven, hell, Satan, angels, God, etc). But it isn't in line with those beliefs, so some parts of it come across as... uncomfortable.<br /><br />However, you should always keep in mind that it is merely fiction. \\"Season of Mists\\" is epic in scope -- it encompasses different worlds, dimensions and lands in a seeemingly endless, wondrously terrifying universe. Gaiman is absolutely brilliant at conjuring the exquisite and the grotesque, the eerie and the strange -- and he manages all of those here.<br /><br />And the art really helps here -- the bleak, raw wastes of Hell, the snowflake beauty of the angels, the visceral grotesqueness of the demons (one is a lumpen creature with a melting eyeless head and toothy mouths for nipples), and the twilit, mildly unnerving realm of Dreaming.<br /><br />As for Morpheus himself, this story is a surprisingly personal one. He's given a realm he doesn't want, but doesn't seem to have any good way of ridding himself of it (at least, not at first). And the Lord of Dream has to face up to his own misdeeds -- namely, he FINALLY figures out that he was horrible to Nada, and that his punishment of her was cruel. The way their story is wrapped up is painful, but still very touching.<br /><br />\\"The Sandman Volume Four: Season of Mists\\" made me uncomfortable with some of its handling of Christian theology, but there is no denying that it is a richly-imagined, powerful story by a master storyteller.and the twilit, mildly unnerving realm of Dreaming.

0060987464|5.0|A scary book that portrays the life of Brian (Marilyn Manson). The book is very interesting as it tells you stories that are beyond belief and at other times humorous ones. His life with out a doubt is an interesting one which makes this book come alive and really captures one. This was a man i hated before but once i read the book i appreciate him much more, a real genius. Must read before judging Marilyn Manson. fantastic book deserving of all the 5 stars.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|If you used to enjoy the old \\"Space Wars\\" or other trading games of old, then you must play this game. Immersive and very scalable in difficulty, it has unlimited potential to waste you time for 5 minutes or 5 months. The game revolves around navigating a very hostile galaxy in search of fame and fortune. You have competition between different classes and clans that constantly interfer with your own plans. This is a very unforgiving game, and deaths are permament for every character on the more difficult settings.   The best parts of the game is that it is very much a work inprogress and the creators are constanty releasing new updates. plus there is a very helpful online community at the game's online forum. This game keeps getting better and better every month.
B0053EZXRS|4.0|I really didn't know what to expect going into this film. I know Cage has throngs of loyal fans and supporters, but I've certainly never been one...by any means. However, I will readily admit that he does have a knack for picking winning pictures and I've enjoyed him in a few them. After watching Drive Angry I can say, without hesitation, that I am still not a cage fan. But I must say that I did enjoy this silly little movie.<br /><br />Cage plays an absolutely driven Hell Block C- (one can only assume) escapee and is simply seething with fury. His motivation in this flick is clear and compelling: avenge daughter's murder; save his grandchild and, by extension, everything else. Lots of 70's era drive-in style sex and violence keep things moving along nicely, and the unexpected appearance in this movie by William Fichtner as \\"The Accountant\\" was a real bonus. Limited exposition regarding Cage's escape prevents the viewer being distracted from the chase, the language, and the overall slightly guilty pleasure which I believe this movie to be. Fun, nasty, and mildly cool. Not too bad for a couple bucks on Amazon.<br /><br />Watch this movie...be entertained. And then go watch a more sophisticated film for depth, intrigue, and all the many things you were never intended to find here.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Best Woody Allen film in many years. I'm a big fan of Allen, and enjoy all his work, but this movie is a return to his sublime magic with films like Manhattan, Annie Hall and Hannah and Her Sisters. And in fact, may be a bit better, or perhaps just very different but equally captivating. Owen Wilson turns in a great performance, as does the entire cast. I found myself swooning during the film, actually falling in love with it as it unfolded on the screen. Lovely surprise. I'm buying this as soon as it is released. It's a keeper.
0553381687|1.0|**Slight \\"spoiler\\" but no plot points are revealed in this review.**<br /><br />You should NOT read this book and start this series if:<br /><br />*You think good always triumphs over evil<br />*You are an optimistic, happy person - this series will leave you feeling as though there is no hope left in the world.<br />*You get attached to characters. My advice: Don't.<br />*You want a happy ending.<br />*You don't want to waste precious time.<br />*You want characters to be happy<br />*You expect a fun an interesting adventure<br /><br />You should read this series if:<br />*You like the feeling of the need to punch the author in the face.<br />*You enjoy extreme violence with moments of slightly vivid sexual conduct (neither was a problem for me), not necessarily paired together.<br />*You like backstabbing that never seems to end<br />*You love it when evil people win<br />*You like to waste your time reading 800ish each pages of worthless, evil trash<br />*You enjoy being set up for something great only to have your hopes torn down and stamped on<br />*You like twists<br />*You like reading medieval stuff where people die<br />*You like descriptions of stuff<br /><br />All in all, I am so sorry I wasted my time. I kept thinking - it's all for a greater purpose, right? It's going to get better, right? And no, in reality, sometimes life doesn't get better and things always get worse. But to do this over and over and over and over again for 4000 pages is just the author slapping me in the face. If I wanted to be continuously depressed and heartbroken, I would watch CNN or those ASPCA commercials on loop.<br /><br />At one point I became so passive about it all that it didn't even surprise me when certain things happened. I started to predict it, because the author became predictable with his complete lack of desire to carry out the story in a thought-provoking, interesting manner with mild variation. It became clear to me that the author was just crapping around. It became so bland to me at one point that I was like...Meh.<br /><br />Another thing I hated- things would come to pass and there would be an explanation for them later, but the explanation made no sense/seemed to be utterly unconnected and without precedent. Random, if you will. Probably could have been better if you had a bit more explanation from characters so as to reveal what they were doing but the author is so arrogant of his writing that he believes readers will just accept it.<br /><br />At times- It is well written. It is engaging. It is engrossing. You won't want to put the book down. And then, the author will tear your heart out, stomp on it, burn it, and then laugh.became so bland to me at one point that I was like...Meh.<br /><br />Another thing I hated- things would come to pass and there would be an explanation for them later, but the explanation made no sense/seemed to be utterly unconnected and without precedent.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Looks great and runs perfectly on Samsung Replenish. I loved this game on PC and am delighted to get it for Android. My only gripe is that it doesn't sync. with the other versions, but that's probably unreasonable :-)
B0045ODPKY|3.0|It seems Angelina Jolie has found her comfort zone when it comes to making movies; special agents who live in a world of complex missions, unsure loyalties, high-tech gadgets, and gunfights.  Whether it be Wanted, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Tombraider, or now this 2010 release, her live-action movies seem to blend into each other.  In this one, she is an American, raised as a Russian spy, who joins the CIA, pretends to carry out her mission for Russia, while intending to save America.  Sounds complicated?  Well, the action scenes help to explain everything, and it does it at under 2 hours in length.  For fans of Jolie's physique, you will be disappointed as she shows no skin; in fact she is often wearing various disguises.  For fans of Bond movies, the Bourne trilogy, and the Mission Impossible films, this is right up your alley.  Overall, an average movie whose biggest distinction is that the star is a female; unlike the previously listed male-anchored films.
0440244870|5.0|I had watched the movie but the only thing left for me was to read the book. And like everyother movie in Hollywood the bookn is not identical as the movie, but most of the book reseambles in the movie. I really enjoy the bokk and sometimes i found myself laughing out loud because Becky does it again. It is a good book to read and the plot is eassy to follow.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|WAY too many bugs for my android phone.    First off it restarts a level if the screen goes to sleep. VERY annoying.    Then if you are playing when your phone rings the whole game goes INSANE.  It locks you out, it forgets your user ID and where you were at.    Overall quite annoying and I would not download until they make a few tweaks for the platform.
0345529057|1.0|Just another person not happy with the price points.      I can't believe:   A) The kindle version is that much more expensive than the paperback version.    B) It is more expensive to buy the bundle than each book by itself.    Count me in as another lost sale.
0812979656|2.0|I don't remember being this disappointed upon reading such a highly acclaimed novel, or rather disappointed perhaps, but not completely put off.  Never has the discrepancy between the review and the material been so vast and as a student of literature, I am not unacustomed to reading the avant garde.<br /><br />This writer's word games veered way out of control; it's the kind of writing you might  expect from a high school creative writing class, and with the constant use of poorly placed literary devices, one word paragraphs, the incessant use of simile after simile after simile and baby-talk repetitions, \\"dum dum,\\" I began to get angry. This was a novel, not poetry. It's true that prose can acquire a luminosity that lifts each phrase out of the mundane, transforming it into a brilliant memory as in the writing of Niall Williams. But this book falls way short.  It is gimicky and self-indulgent to the extreme and should have been pared down by a judicious editor. With all the good writers out there today having difficulty getting published, those who write clean, meaningful \\"prose\\" (a word this writer would do well to familiarize herself with).  it's a shame that this book should have received the over the top hype it doesn't deserve.  There is a sensitive story here that is tragically obscured by a lot of fluff.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For the price you just can't beat it. I've seen a lot of people say it ruins the blade of expensive knives, but why would you take a $10 sharpener to a $100 knife in the first place? I used this thing on my old boy scout knife. The blade was dull as butter and had chips in it and I could never get it back into good condition. But less than a minute with this sharpener and I could shave with it. You just can't beat it. I highly recommend this to have to use on good work knives.
B0004Z33EQ|2.0|Due to the great success of \\"First Blood\\" fans demanded that Stallone grab his knife and bow and return for some action. \\"Rambo First Blood part 2\\" did deliver the action, but the story lacked after the increadible story that \\"First Blood\\" was.    \\"Rambo First Blood part 2\\" picks up right about where the first one leaves off. Rambo has been in prison for a while. The film opens with him chopping rocks. Col. Trautman comes to tell Rambo that there is some strong emotions invested in the pows left in Vietnam and they are looking for someone who can go into Vietnam and investigate. Rambo excepts this offer as it gets him out of prision and back to what he does best.  When Rambo meets the man in charge of this mission, he is not impressed due to his lack of interest in Vietnam, and his lack of knowledge about the topic.  When Rambo lands in Vietnam and finds the village he is supposed to take pictures of, he discovers the camp is not empty and in fact there are about a dozen pows. Rambo takes one of the pows to the extraction site and Murdock the man in charge orders an abort of the mission. Rambo is left in Vietnam.    Overall, Rambo part 2 fails to live up to the original \\"First Blood.\\" The plot is not the best and the effort was focused too much on the action.
B003UMW66G|5.0|If you appreciate the art of a beautiful independant movie production than you will love this. Hero shows a wonderful use of cinematography and color selection, beautiful cinematic slow paced storytelling and a soundtrack that touches you somewhere deep.    Also consider that this is a chinese influenced film and not the traditional overdubbed Japanese sword fighting films you might be used to. Ashes Of Time (1994, Wong Kar-Wai) would be another example of this style of cinematic filmmaking.     Loved it.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I love Plants vs Zombies and played through the desktop version and was excited to see it come out for Android. The playability on my Viewsonic Gtablet is great. Unfortunately as of the 1.0 version I'm lucky if I can make it through a level without the game freezing and I have to drop out and force kill it. Maybe an update will make the game worth paying for. Since I got it as the free app of the day I can't complain much.
B004NSULHM|5.0|Only a band like Radiohead could pack so much into such a short album. This is a stellar piece of music, filled with some truly beautiful tracks (Codex might be my track of the year thus far.) The watery, dream-like atmospheric quality of the music is truly artful, and each track showcases the complex, layered, meaningful music that this band is able to accomplish. The fact that they seem to make it look effortless is, to me, the most impressive part of the album, and ironically, probably the least appreciated aspect of the music.    This is not Kid A, or OK Computer, and it certainly isn't In Rainbows, but just like those albums, this is Radiohead, pure and simple. This is them at their best, making the kind of high-level music that challenges and delights with each listen. It's music that has kept them relevant as a major artistic power for nearly twenty years now... just stop and think about that for a second. How many other bands have maintained a spot on the cutting edge of musical artistry for so long? How many other bands have even come close to accomplishing what Radiohead has accomplished?    The King of Limbs is a masterwork from a band that's trained it's listeners to expect nothing less. And with standards that high, you have to understand that not everyone is going to pleased. But they should be pleased, because this is truly a stellar album, an evocative and brilliantly composed piece of artistry. Fans shouldn't just be pleased - they should be grateful.
B001RPZDY0|5.0|I am just back from movie theater where I saw the last Met Production.  I am so glad, so glad I bought this DVD.  Wow - much better. New and bold, good singing.  Hvorostovski is better here.  Jose Cura is better than Marcelo Alvarez (here).  So, if you would like to have a good Il Trovatore, buy this one.  The only BAD thing about this DVD is the absence of ITALIAN SUBTITLES.  All DVDs should have original language subtitles - even if in RUSSIAN.
0765365278|5.0|In The Way Of Kings, Brandon Sanderson has written the first volume of what will be the decade's foremost fantasy trilogy, The Stormlight Archive. The book takes place in Roshar, a bleak world of stone and storms. The people of Roshar have been involved in a war for years to avenge the killing of their king. The war takes place on The Shattered Plains, a bleak area with massive chasms and stony ground. They meet and fight the people of the Plains, both for revenge and to win gemhearts.<br /><br />The society is based on magic. Centuries ago, the land was ruled by the ten consecrated orders of the Knights Radiant. Those orders and warriors fell, leaving nothing but their almost-invincible armor and swords, called Shardplate and Shardblades. When armored in Shardplate, an ordinary warrior becomes almost invincible and can fight off entire battalions. Shardblades can cut through anything. Both are valued above anything else in Roshar; and those who own them are the rulers of the country.<br /><br />Roshar now is ruled by a young king, the murdered king's son. He has ten Brightlords who each have armies and who fight for him, but they are not united. There are plots and counterplots, alliances and betrayals. Overall, the land is much weaker than in the past. And the signs are grim. Everything points to the coming of The Desolations again, perhaps to utterly destroy the land.<br /><br />There are four individuals who seem to be the focus of both the hope and the despair that may come. Dalinar Kholin is one of the king's Brightlords, and his uncle and most trusted advisor. Renowned for his battle expertise, troubling rumors have started to circulate about Dalinar. He has been having visions of the past, and those visions make him question whether the ways of man are the way forward, or if they need to reach back to the ways of old.<br />Shallan is a young woman, ignorant and untested. She comes to court hoping to become the ward of the king's sister, a renowned scholar. She is accepted and learns to love knowledge and education, but she can't forget that she has come to court to attempt to steal a great treasure to help out her family back home and save it from ruin and poverty.<br /><br />Then there is the assassin. No one knows who he is or why he kills, but his targets are never safe. He kills with ruthless efficiency, but each killing grates at his soul. His life is not his own, but hostage to the master who owns his oathstone. As long as his oathstone is held by another, he must obey their every command, no matter how foreign it is to his nature.<br /><br />Finally, there is Kaladin. Raised as a surgeon's son, he joined the army instead when his younger brother was recruited. Far from admiring the Brightlords he joined the army to protect, he has grown to loathe them as they betray him and the codes of honor again and again. Due to these betrayals, Kaladin is now a slave, assigned to the bridge carriers, the most dangerous job in the army. Yet even in this lowly position, he finds a way to affect events around him.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for fantasy readers. If you have a fantasy reader in your life, run, don't walk, to the nearest bookstore and purchase The Way Of Kings for them. Sanderson has created a harsh world that challenges the men who attempt to survive in it, but gives glimpses of what can be. Like the best fantasy sagas, there is a moral code underlying the entire story that keeps the reader enthralled. Readers will be thrilled with this first book and anxiously await the next.love knowledge and education, but she can't forget that she has come to court to attempt to steal a great treasure to help out her family back home and save it from ruin and poverty.

0356500535|5.0|The reviews for this book are unusually mixed. I loved it, and for reasons that I think reflect the differing reactions.       Normally, I would stay far away from an author with reviews like these (from Amazon's editorial reviews for the author's \\"Pump Six and Other Stories\\"):      \\"Bacigalupi ... displays ... astute social commentary and consciousness-altering power ... Bacigalupi's collected visions of the future are equal parts cautionary tale, social and political commentary....\\"    \\"These are not subtle stories. Bacigalupi makes no secret of his social attitudes..\\"     \\"Bacigalupi is what you might call the anti-Heinlein: There are no saviors or competent white men in his worlds...  He s a truly dark bard, in the spirit of Ellison at his most vivid and cynical.\\"    These reviews make Bacigalupi sound like a typical \\"modern\\" writer of science fiction -- the type who takes a cookie-cutter world of environmental disaster and populates it with cookie-cutter characters of approved attitudes, ethnicities, and sexual orientations. Gosh, how many times have we seen seemingly talented writers waste their time, and ours, on such nonsense?    Fortunately for me, I came across one of Bacigalupi's short stories in an anthology and wanted to read more. The Windup Girl is everything I hoped, and then some. There's lots of gritty imagination at work here, intriguing characters, and a political perspective that is not reflexively liberal at all.     Without spoiling anything, I'll just mention two of the characters who stick with me. One is Hock Seng. Fate keeps trying to crush him, and by all rights it should have succeeded many times over. But he just keeps hanging in there, despite everything, even if he has to do some terrible things to keep going. The other character is Kanya. Her character is the type I almost always ridicule -- the tough-as-nails policewoman who can beat any man. Only this time, she's far more believable and interesting. There's no claim that she is physically stronger than her male counter-parts, her own motivations are complex, and there is a key male character who she uses as model and foil.    I'll also mention one of the key strengths of the story that I think has gone mostly unmentioned in the reviews. Bacigalupi's characters are all concerned with making a living. The dystopian aspect of their world intensifies their difficulties, but anyone who actually works to support themselves and others will recognize their struggle. Bacigalupi handles this theme really well, and it reminds me a bit of the way Raymond Chandler (to switch genres) tells his detective stories without losing sight of the fact that the detective needs to make some money, not just solve crimes.    There is some, though not an excess, of nasty violent sex. It's not gratuitous; it advances the plot in its way. I see that some readers were put off by a particular scene, and I can't blame them. If this is not a deal-killer for you, or if you are willing to skip a few paragraphs when the scene is well beyond an R rating, then treat yourself to this book as one of the very best of current science fiction. (Another recommendation: author Michael Swanwick)
6305897786|2.0|The Ninth Gate is a utterly rubbish film from director Roman Polanski. A film that makes absolutely no sense of anykind.<br />Setting for this satanical thriller is fairly interesting and the team behind this film is talented though. Photographer Darius Khondji does good job behind the camera and succesfully captures the rich coulours of the interesting locations. Films best thing by far is the fantastic score by great Wojciech Kilar, whose composition for this film is atmospheric and eerie stuff of dreams. These two things are the only good things i can point out from this silly film.<br />Sure, i can see that Polanski has clearly put some of his typical deadpan humour into this one and hardly meant it to be taken seriously, but he does not make it enough tongue in a cheeck to work or serious enough to be taken seriously. Now it is just constantly verging between self-parody and more serious approach. End result is sadly uneven and most of all highly unbalanced.<br />I think that with the different kind of approach and huge trimming this could have been even something good, but now it is just trashy.
1400067936|5.0|I simply loved this book! It really helps you to understand and think about probablity not only in markets but everywhere.  Taleb mainly writes about markets but he could also apply his insights to genetics and crime.  I sort of wish he would, because I think he would have a lot of valuable things to say about sanctimommies who think that just because their 2-year-olds are devlopmentally advanced that they are experts on raising children -- after all they could just be lucky, or their children's problems simply haven't kicked in yet.     Taleb's writing also makes me ponder the pointlessness of envy.  After all, before Alabama teen Natalie Holloway met Joran Van der Sleuth, people would have thought that her mother, Beth Holloway, had had the perfect life: she was happily married, slim, pretty, and well-to-do with a bright, beautiful, healthy daugher who never gave her any trouble.  But I doubt that anyone would envy Beth Holloway today after her daughter continues to be missing.    I hope Mr. Taleb will write his next book on probability in everyday situations, but I sort of doubt that he will.  I know that he won't read this review because as he wrote: \\"The information from an anonymous reader on Amazon.com is all about the person, while that of a qualified person, is going to be all about the book\\".  I still loved the book even though the auther considers reading my review beneath him.  Now does that say more about the book or about me?
B00000099Y|5.0|It's Tool.. what more can I say? They are a very talented all around super amazing band. From lyrics to the ambient noise to the spectacular combination of these musicians. If you don't know them, get acquainted.
B000N3ST8O|3.0|There is a 16 year difference between this and TimeSpace; however, there is only a 2 album difference, only one of which is accounted for. Must you continue punishing Street Angel?  This time around, only the hits find a place here. She even adds Silver Springs, 2 extended live versions of songs, and a dance remix(!) of Dreams, which is actually pretty good. Hardcore rock music fans probably don't think so. As far as new material, she only gives a live version of her take of Rock & Roll. To make matters exceptionally worse, she puts the album version of Stand Back on here, instead of the TimeSpace best version. Sadness.   What makes this album redundant is the mere 2 album difference, from which only 2 songs come, which leads to an identical singles pool. Worse, this is her first release of any kind in 6 years, not including Say You Will; that's Fleetwood Mac. Even though a nice new remix single of Stand Back was released as promotion for it, that still doesn't take away the fact that this album is largely redundant, and carrying too little to compensate for the 6 year silence.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Even though Amazon told me that the game didn't work on my phone, I downloaded it anyway because I read all of the good reviews and got excited. It works on my MyTouch 3G Slide! I am a newbie to this game so I didn't know it was on iPhone  or Xbox 360 or whatever, but I know it's a darn good game!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Due to the amount of detail, I 've always thought the Harry Potter books were better than the movies, but that not-withstanding, the story was easy to follow, and the ending was a definite cliff-hanger in preparation for the final chapter.........
B002ZG975Q|3.0|Good looking cast. . .considering the premise of the movie yeah a tongue-n-cheek comment, but serious at the same time.<br /><br />Some good acting parts...other parts were just forced glib dialogue. Actually the first part of the movie tries to make the characters smart and snippy at each other, but it was just too forced and unbelievable.<br /><br />Sounded like the soundtrack would be worth checking out.<br /><br />The whole teenage wicca curse thing was just plain stupid!!!<br /><br />How Vanessa's character finds herself living at the Kyle character's same house was bad, bad writing!<br /><br />Will is a hilarious character and the delivery by Neil Patrick Harris was well done.<br /><br />The movie ends without the full feel good closure for the supporting characters and the sub-plots introduced with them. That was disappointing.<br /><br />I love the idea of resurrecting letter writing between people like they do in the movie. I still have all the letters my wife and I wrote each other during our dating years. Romantic!<br /><br />OVERALL: I've seen worse movies, but this did have some moments. If you really have nothing else to watch, its an okay way to blow off 90minutes.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|in the first five harry potter series, the third one, prisoner of azkaban, was the only weak one, i enjoyed the other four, the sixth one was weak but not bad, just missing the fun of what made the harry potter series enjoyable to watch.<br /><br /> now, we have to make the 7th movie into two parts, instead of finishing off the series with a great movie, we get an ok movie way too drawn out, and really, do we need to cover emma watson's top parts so much, while everyone else is dressed normal, she has to wear enough clothes to survive in the artic winters, yes, some teen girls have boobs, she's not the only one, of course no matter what harry potter fans will get this movie, like i did.<br /><br />but without going into a long review they took the fun out of these movies, if you like harry potter get it, but it could have been much better and should have been, but everyone made more money, which is the only thing a studio cares about now, just like the rest of us, so what could have been is not, so we take what they give us, i got my copy new for 10 bucks, would not have paid anymore for it, as usual amazon delivers like a champ, but miss the charm of the older potter movies..<br /><br />in all still a good movie, just expect a lot darker movie with no fun left in it, can't we have horror and suspense with a little fun too, guess not..
B00328R21C|3.0|I go to Amazon for EVERYTHING I need... except for Lego toys. Holy CRAP, what is with the markups on Lego (TM)(R)(C) on this site? it's like 40%-150%! The sellers here are BRAZEN.     DO NOT BUY, at least without looking at the actual list price.    That being said, don't want to be one of those douches who low rate a product because the seller is not good or it was raining on the day it shipped.... so....    It's ok. If you want R2D2, I don't know of another way to do it. But... whoo, the land speeder, let's play out all those ... battles... and things... that happened?... with the... uh... land speeder.     \\"These are not the droids you are looking for\\"    That's it. That's all you can do. AND! You can't even do that because there is no room for the droids on the *$@^@^#& land speeder. There is, however, a quite useless \\"cargo hatch\\" if you lift the rear center engine off... you could store some studs there, pretend you're playing Lego (TM) Star Wars (R)(C)(TM).    Oh, and the Storm Trooper's droid thingy is FLOATING, you can tell because its lower half is clearish. I don't remember that, probably some non-canonical stuff added after Lucas lost his MIND somewhere in the early 80s before or during ROTJ.    Also, do NOT eat these, they do not digest.    (also, the shoulder cape thing on the storm trooper is AWESOME, no doubt, but why is it not orange?)
B0047S1KMS|5.0|for us living in the usa, i was glad to find an all region disc for this series, i saw the last two parts on amc months ago, but never saw the first 3, finally just bought the disc, should have been done in two discs, not one, extras are great, movie great, ending was easily done but could have been better, can't say more without spoiling, but if you are a zombie fan you will need this series.<br /><br />spoiler alert..............<br />liked the big brother theme, would have liked to see more people survive the initial onslaught and a little more story of what started the zombie outbreak,<br />and had someone shoot the big mouthed producer instead of letting him get them all killed in the end.<br /><br />born to be a cult classic, this series should have been longer with more people survive, and maybe had some try to escape and have had a separate sequence of events, or die some other way, the characters were entertaining even with the hard to understand dialect...
B0029QRA1U|3.0|The turntable is good for the money but the software is lacking. I could not get the audio input low enough and this made for some real bad distortion. Also it make you put in Itunes. That I did not like. I ended up buying Vinylsoft and it is very easy to use and had scratch and pop filtration and cleanup. You do have to install LAME.

B00005N6KG|4.0|I bought these to wear while exercising because those iPod ear buds are always falling out.  These work just fine and are reasonably priced.  I've bought three pair since they're so reasonably priced.  Sound quality is fine.
B000JQV68A|1.0|I initially downloaded this book thinking that since it was from Fitzgerald's and I had read the Great Gatsby and liked it, I'd like this one as well.  Boy was I wrong. I kept reading hoping that it would get better but I found it just awful the more I read. At least I got it free and didn't have to pay for it otherwise I'd be even more upset. If you like main characters who seem not to have a purpose and spend their entire days wondering about their existence and doing absolutely nothing at all then this book is for you. Also, if you're a diehard F.Scott Fitzgerald fan and absolutely love all his writing then this book is for you. If you like your characters to have a purpose even if it's only on the printed page then stay away from this one. I don't care if it's supposedly semi autobiographical, what a waste of time.
B004SKIPXW|5.0|Being a fan of Cage flicks ranging from The Rock to Vampires kiss, this is by far the best he's done to date.  I don't mean an oscar worthy performance, no-sir. This is exploitation film at it's finest.  If you are a fan of Machete, Shoot em up, Planet Terror or any other grindhouse esque film, your wallet better be in your hand, the credit card embedded into your computer screen and the flames of hell shooting out of your eyeballs.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fair warning - don't even think about starting this book unless you have a block of time on your hands. You won't be able to put it down. if you liked Ender's Game, or the series Firefly, you'll like this. I don't really see how this can be called a children's book. The whole premise is disturbing to say the least. i've already downloaded the next title, but I won't start it tonight because I am afraid I won't be able to go to bed until I finish it!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I never expected this. That a male performer like Eddie Vedder can create such a tender, powerful, and beautiful set of songs, on a ukelele no less, is just astonishing. This CD restored my love for current generation musical performers in one listening. I sit here stunned by the beauty of this man's talent. Five stars is not enough.
B0014Z4ON4|2.0|I saw INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM at the theater when it first came out in 1984. The \\"Test\\" for me was going with an old boyfriend, but the sequences and DARKNESS in those \\"certain\\" gross scenes are still \\"uneasy fare for the gut\\", 27 years later. Im married since '85, and now, having now sat thru it a second time with my 21 year old son, it is ME hiding my eyes asking HIM \\"Is it over yet?\\" Its no wonder they needed a brighter,exciting,  REAL adventure for #3 and they came thru adding Sean Connery as Indy's Dad..THAT one Ive seen many time, but Ladies? Why suffer \\"gastric distress\\" if you don't have to? AVOID #2... at least for a GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Just saw the trailer for Twilight Breaking Dawn part One and I am blown away already....serious creepy stuff and major \\"wedding night\\" scene give away!!! I cannot wait for this to open..everyone who is a fan of this wonderful series will nominate Stephenie Meyer for Sainthood....please watch it, the chills are worth it...........
B004LQ1XBY|5.0|I haven't listened to anything else since I got it. I was driving in the car with my Dad, & he said \\"I don't know who this is, but he's a really good piano player!\\" How's that for an unbiased review?
B002ZFQD04|5.0|The DVD is excellent.  A must to a die-hard Madonna fan.  Madonna is one of the best entertainers in the world and this concert will not disappoint.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works flawlessly. Excellent graphics and sounds. It's just like the pc version. For reference, I'm running this on an LG  Optimus V.
0670022411|5.0|As a paranormal/urban fantasy fan, I simply don't know why I waited so long to read this amazing book!<br /><br />Getting through all the backstory that lasted for its first hundred pages was the only quibble I may have with it.  However, the last 500 pages more than made up for it!  The characters actually breathed they were so lifelike.  The storyline completely engaging and the pacing perfection.  I was disappointed when it ended.<br /><br />Checking into Google for an interview by the author I was delighted to hear it was first of a trilogy and that Ms. Harkness is already working on the sequel with publication next year.  Hurray!<br /><br />I have learned my lesson and will \\"Pre-Order\\" the next one the minute it comes available!<br /><br />Enjoy the read!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|extremely fun but freezes and restarts my phone while playing. why is there a 20 word minimum now I have to post a useless sentence
B0052UZIFA|1.0|there is a reason this game has been half off since it came out. its a horrible port. what took so long? this could have been done in a weekend. blurry graphics, lagging and freezing, and not all the features other versions have. don't waste your money.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|These segments are so riveting and mind boggling.  They take you to another place and it is so exciting!
B004SBQALA|4.0|Movie was good. The action was not so bad, when there was some, and story was ok. They set up for a second movie, so watch this in case there is a second one.
B001OGNOES|4.0|For the most part there are two types of Metal fans, those that like Testament and those who haven't heard much Testament. Obviously there are a few exceptions, but it illustrates a point, Testament are the kind of band to make loyal fans out of the vast majority of people who listen to them. Should you be reading this and wondering whether or not to try out Testament, I would strongly recommend that you do as you will almost certainly become a life long fan.<br /><br />Its pretty difficult to argue with The New Order really, any album that contains `Into The Pit,\\"Disciples of the Watch,' and `The Preacher,' is pretty much guaranteed, to put a smile on the face of any right minded metal fan, being as they are three of the absolute best Thrash Metal songs ever recorded. Should you be in any doubt as to whether or not to buy this album, then listen to any one of those songs, which will likely provide you with the all the convincing necessary.<br /><br />To be considered anything other than wonderful whilst containing the aforementioned tracks, the album would have to be pretty damn poor for the rest of the run-time and thankfully The New Order is anything but poor. The album opens with the effective `Eerie Inhabitants,' a straight up Thrash number with a clean beginning for added interest, contains a number of pummeling thrash classics, two relatively interesting instrumentals and a heavied-up Areosmith cover to prevent the album being too repetitive.<br /><br />Overall, the music is hard and direct Thrash Metal, with enough variety to escape tedium while still remaining true to the formula. The vocals as always are top quality and the level of musicianship is very high. There is a reason this album keeps turning up in lists of The Greatest Metal Albums Of All Time after all.<br /><br />If you have an interest in Thrash Metal then you really should check out Testament, and The New Order is a very good album to try.
0670022411|5.0|I became instantly enthralled in this book from the very first chapter. I'll admit it is a bit similar to Twilight but its written better and is an adult version. With Twilight I never had the urge to start the books over again but with A Discovery of Witches I desire to read it again though I just finished it two nights ago.     When Diana and Matthew took refuge at her Aunt's house in America I could have done without the constant writing of Diana's sleep and eating habits though I did find a number of recipes to try - walnuts coated in vanilla and sugar sound delicious!     After reading the negative reviews concerning the ending I assumed I would not like it, surprisingly, I liked the ending.     Most books in a series have a plot, a conflict and a resolution different to each book; A Discovery of Witches is an exception. Harkness builds upon the global consequence of Matthew and Diana's budding relationship using historical, scientifical and magical evidence and lore throughout the novel. The use of such evidence/lore would make it seem that Harkness is only writing of one colossal conflict in a series of three books vs. three small conflicts in each of her books.     I for one am used to reading series books where there is a conflict and resolution in each book but I instantly took a liking to the way in which she ended her novel.  I feel as though Harkness wrote the ending the way she did in order to leave her readers at the same point Matthew and Diana's families and friends were left at.    For me, it would seem nearly impossible not finishing the series because book one left me wanting so much more of the story. I highly recommend this book if you like romance, fantasy, other worldly beings, science, history, wine and food or even if you just want something entertaining.
B000002IOJ|4.0|Practice What You Preach is one of the crowning achievements in Testament's long and excellent career. The band started off strong and continued to release strong material. This, their third studio album introduced a wider array of lyrical topics, vocal styles and guitar melodies to their already impressive formula.<br /><br />With songs like `Sin Of Omission,' \\"Nightmare (Coming Back To You)\\" and the impressive Title Track it is no wonder why people still love this record and band.<br /><br />Every musician is on top form, with exciting lead bass sections, melodic and impressive guitar solos, furious drumming and Chuck Billy's fantastic voice all gelling perfectly together to create dynamic and interesting music with both enough harsh and heavy metal credibility and thoughtful melodic sections to appease most sections of the metal listening public.<br /><br />Testament represent all the best traits of the Thrash Metal movement and provide an excellent standard of musicianship, songwriting, virtuosity and (for the time) production value that was of the best quality without being overblown and commercially sheened.<br /><br />You will frequently read the sentiment that it is a great shame Testament never broke as big as Metallica, Megadeth et al and listening to any Testament album you will find yourself agreeing, this isn't something people just blindly say like sheep, Testament really are legend-quality even if they unfortunately never achieved a legend level of success.<br /><br />To conclude; If you like Metal you really ought to check out Testament, and if you like Testament then you really ought to check out Practice What You Preach.
0439023513|5.0|Very good read! I could not stop. I personally would have probably picked a different ending, but it was still good. I am sad to see the series end.
B00171WXY2|5.0|Testament return with a brand new studio album, reuniting 4/5 of the classic line up and bringing with them the incredible Paul Bostaph, one of metal's most underrated drummers and a true embodiment of thrash itself.<br /><br />What a strong album The Formation Of Damnation truly is. The album mixes the band's trademark thrash metal roots with the more contemporary style found on later releases such as `The Gathering,' to create a very heavy, very fast and ultimately a very impressive album.<br /><br />The blistering `More Than Meets the Eye,' is incredibly fast and catchy, highlighting the bands thrash metal style, which contrasts nicely with the title track; `The Formation of Damnation,' which is a more modern mixture of contemporary metal and death metal. (Especially rewarding considering Chuck Billy's impressive vocal style)<br />Elsewhere, the poignant track `Afterlife,' uses a mixture of melody and terrific lyrics to deliver a simple but effective message in a powerful style.<br /><br />Overall, This is the sort of album that you will still be listening to in twenty years time, it just feels like a classic and sounds like a monster. `Brutal,' is an understatement, but its the closest you're going to get to a fitting description. The album toes the line between modern and classic in a very successful way, and I strongly recommend you give it a chance. Its as creative as `Low,' and as energetic as `The Legacy.'<br /><br />I can't recommend this monster of an album highly enough.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|I felt very little emotion and connection to the characters and storyline. I feel this movie could have been written and performed so much better.<br /><br />Unlike the animated series on television years ago, which was done very well, the live-action movies have always seemed poorly done to me.
B000002IKR|4.0|Testament's 1987 debut album The Legacy is one of the most respected and highly regarded records to emerge from the Thrash Metal movement.<br /><br />The album contains many of the band's most enduring and popular songs which are still present in the band's live repertoire to this day, proof if it was needed of the album's relevance and staying power. The Legacy is not a flavour of the week release that you will play a few times and then discard forever, but rather an album which you will return to time and again.<br /><br />Musically; Testament were never as direct and ferocious as on The Legacy, delivering harder, darker and more energetic songs than on their subsequent albums and what the album lacks in variety it makes up for in intensity. Don't let that statement confuse you however, Testament still manage to pack in a surprisingly diverse collection of musically interesting songs on this album.<br /><br />The band are proficient in all areas, the guitars and bass are excellent, the vocals and drumming are superb and the production is of a surprisingly high quality for a Thrash band's debut album.<br /><br />The album contains the memorable `Raging Waters,' `The Haunting,' and `Over The Wall,' all of which are classic songs.<br />The highlight of the album is the catchy and interesting album closer `Apocalyptic City,' which covers a lot of ground in its five minute run time.<br /><br />To summarise, The Legacy is a very strong album that deserves its strong reputation. If you have any interest in the band whatsoever, or even just Thrash in general, then this is something you'll want to be listening to.

B004QK5N5W|3.0|I purchased this adapter for my iPad 2 but unfortunately will be returning it. The quality of the product is just like any other Apple product - excellent. The product does exactly what it claims - it mirrors your iPad2's screen on your HD TV. However, for those who own an Apple TV this adapter is really unnecessary. Without having you to plug in your iPad you can play video, audio, or even internet (with the right app) through Airplay. Now that iOS 5 was announced today, you will also be able to mirror your iPad 2 on your Apple TV through Airplay. So until this Apple TV os update is released, unless you have some specific need other than audio/video, such as using FaceTime over the big screen, this adapter is a waste of your money. Instead, use it on some other Apple product like the bluetooth keyboard or another smart cover.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Loved, loved this book.   I was fortunate to get a prerelease and I am grateful.   I found it to be unlike any social media book I have read in the past, a must read for fellow business owners.  It's like a phd in the art of being likable!
1423389387|4.0|For a well written fantasy I missed being able to skim<br />ahead. The somewhat slow development of the plot made you want<br />some action at times.

0743201140|5.0|The book defines a strength as a natural talent that is enhanced with learned skills and experience.  It was helpful to me to break up the specific components of a strength.  The premise of the book is that the only strengths that a person CAN excel at are the strengths that are founded on natural talent.  The author argues that a successful career will allow a person to develop their talents into strengths.<br /><br />The main objective of the book is to provide the reader with a short list of his/her dominant strengths to provide direction in the person's career.  The strengths are identified by completing an online personality test that is activated with a 16 character code from a sealed page inside the book.  The book then spends ~8 pages looking at each of 30 possible strengths giving examples of ways to use the strength in a successful career.<br /><br />In college I took a few personality tests to try to choose a career path.  With each personality test I took (before this one) I found a consistent flaw: the results could be swayed by what you wanted the results to be.  Other personality tests will frequently pose a question and then provide two possible answers; one of which (for example) indicates creative thinking, the other of which indicates analytical thinking.  The characteristic of this test, however, is that the possible responses are never opposites.  In many cases both answers COULD be a good response, and the test-taker is required to choose the response that fits better.  The result for me was a short list of strengths that accurately describe me in terms that I hadn't considered before.

B000O1799U|4.0|Dreamgirls was killed by its own hype. Going into the 2006 awards season, this film had been predicted as the frontrunner for Best Picture of the Year. However, upon its release, most found the film to lack in all the goods it was supposed to offer. That is not to say that the film was completely dead in the water. With Dreamgirls came the stardom that is now Jennifer Hudson, an ex-American Idol contestant. But overall, the Best Picture nomination was not in the stars for Dreamgirls (despite it taking home the honor for Best Picture: Musical/Comedy at the Golden Globes), and it seems to have slowly been forgotten over time, minus Hudson's star-making performance as Effie White.    After some years, I finally decided to give Dreamgirls another watch, after reading someone gushing over it in their blog. Now, I have always been a huge fan of Dreamgirls, from the first time I saw it. I was lucky enough to witness it in theaters twice, and each time, I was slapped in the face with brilliance. I could hardly take it all in; it was sleek and quick (despite its 130 minute runtime), and I loved every minute of it. But much like everyone else, I almost forgot about it entirely. So it was with an almost gleeful anticipation that I rewatched it, and I have no idea why on earth I had forgotten about it in the first place.     I mean, let's discuss the one slightly... not great quality about it: Jamie Foxx. He wasn't awful and he didn't make the movie suffer overall for it, but ultimately, furrowing your brow doesn't make you a sleaze. However, the case could be made that this was all intentional, he gave his character of Curtis no soul because he was a simply superficial man, claiming that music is supposed to merely sell... not to make a message and evoke emotion from its listeners. Maybe another rewatch is in order to fully understand his performance.    But with that, we can get on to the good. Where to begin? This time, going into the film, there was no hype, there was nothing to be disappointed by. I just sat back and enjoyed the movie, and what an experience it was this time. And a large part of this is due to Bill Condon's fabulous direction. The film instantly starts in the fast paced world that all the characters are witnessing. We are there with them, and we watch as they go on through this journey. I sometimes thought it to be a fault that it was almost SO fast paced that we could hardly breathe and let the while movie sink in, but now I realize that is what makes it so brilliant in its own right: we are experiencing just as much as Effie, Deena and Lorrell are. We are just along for the ride. Along with that is the screenplay, which is subtly captivating, keeping us on course. This also walks hand-in-hand with the editing that never lets us look away from the story we are seeing, whether it be for the first time or after many viewings. The art direction is dazzling and the costume design is delicious, soulful to the period without detracting too much from the story. You notice the evolution of the costumes throughout the film, starting from frumpy, homely ensembles, to sophisticated and stylish dresses. It is all so splendid on the eyes.    And finally, the ensemble is one to watch out for. Every part in the film has some significance to the story. That said, Anika Noni Rose steals her scenes with as much gusto as she possibly can with the limited screentime she is given against her co-stars. Beyoncé Knowles has always ilicited mixed responses for her performance as Deena, but this time around, I noticed the subtle mannerisms that help make Deena tic and why all of her actions unfold the way they do. It's not a performance that deserved Oscar consideration, but Knowles proves why she was cast as the \\"lead\\" aside from her star power and vocal ability. Despite what Curtis says to her in the film, she DOES have a voice with so much distinction and heart, her song \\"Listen\\" goes down as one of the films most heartfelt and raw scenes, thanks to Beyoncé's gut wrenching vocals and delivery. And of course there is Eddie Murphy as Jimmy Early, the fading star who tries desperately to keep his image as an enteratiner. We slowly watch his descent from grace and Murphy delivers his best performance ever here. He's hilarious, but that exterior is slowly and slowly deteriorated with madness and drug addiction. His spiral is heartbreaking and honest, making his motives and storyline all the more upsetting and poignant.    And that leaves the last performance to discuss: La Hudson. Taking home almost every award possible, Hudson sinks her teeth into the role of Effie White, and it is almost hard to imagine anyone else playing this role (even Jennifer Holliday who originated the role on Broadway). Some have criticized her acting (while still heralding her singing), but I just cannot see cracks in this performance. Effie is a diva through and through, and as we continue this journey with the Dreams, we see Effie emerge as a human being. We are just as much on this journey as she is. We see her blatantly snubbed and kicked to the curb, and through it all, she perserveres and comes back with so much fire and passion, it is almost incredible to watch. Hudson blows the roof off all of her performances, \\"And I Am Telling You\\" will go down in musical history from the heart and desperation Hudson displays here. From her phenomenal voice to her stage prescense, you cannot take your eyes off of her. My mouth was gaping open during her whole scene, I might've shed a tear during her scene... I really did. I felt every single emotion coming from her, not just in this scene, but in every scene we see Effie. Hudson just has this power of captivating her audience and she takes on this role with no inhibitions and crafts one of the past decade's finest performances.    I know, I'm gushing. And I know I am definitely not the best at writing reviews, but these are just scattered thoughts on my latest viewing of Dreamgirls.It's a film gays will always worship, and a lot of it could... actually be seen as camp, and that makes me appreciate even that much more. But I hope it makes you all consider just watching it again. For me, it was an experience I won't soon forget.

B002YMWPUA|5.0|The life and times of Bobby Sands elapse from the moment he is sent to prison, passing through his phenomenal sequence with the priest in which he revelas his inner thoughts about the political situation and the two different optics are carved in relief in that unforgettable dialogue.<br /><br />The film depicts with eloquent images the horror, moral devastation and progressive final of a human being who refuses to live. Bobby Sands goes on a hunger strike and during 66 days his voice will be heard through all his country, Europe and the entire world.<br /><br />Perhaps, no other film has depicted with such level of crudeness the real nature of this controversial issue. Sands assumes his own road protesting against the status as political prisioners rather than ordinary criminals.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender makes one of the top 10 best male performances of the decade with this well rounded film. Perfect, superb and magisterial masterwork that must not be ignored.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Love the game is very addicting, has a lot of replay value and variety but the game is extremely buggy and often freezes up my phone to the point of having to pull the battery. I have a high end phone as well so this means it was poorly coded (epic 4g) disregarding the bugs its a good game and def worth the purchase.  3 stars until its updated to be more stable.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I am very happy with the product I purchased. I loved the show, now I can watch it anytime I choose.  It arrived when they said it would.  Would purchase from this person again.

0553805371|3.0|The Grand Design is a beautiful book. The illustrations, the feel of the pages and the elegance of Mr. Hawking's writing style make it all a great experience to read. Unfortunately, I found the book surprisingly thin on the side of new content. I am an avid reader of popular science, particularly books about the wondrous world of theoretical physics so I am well versed  the ideas of quantum mechanics and relativity. The Grand Design promises a new outlook on topics that involve the creation of the universe, yet 75-80% of the book is a slew of background knowledge about the history of theoretical physics. In fact, some of Hawking's most interesting ideas appear on literally the last two pages of the book.    I am not unhappy totally with the book, yet I can't help but feel like this work was rushed because little new content is proposed.
0307887960|5.0|I rec'd this book just 2 days after ordering it.  I read it through quickly then re-read it in depth twice more.  I went to Dukan website, calculated my True Weight, then started the diet.  In three days I lost 5 pounds. And continue to lose, but at a slower pace.  It's definitely worth trying and staying with, as you know how long each phase will last.  You can do anything if you know there's a target date!

B003VR5PPY|3.0|After reading about this game on various forums, checking published reviews, and reading reviews right here on Amazon, I decided to give 999 a shot.  In fact, I have a stack of about a dozen DS games still in the shrink wrap, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews I saw for this game inspired me to choose this one next.  I have not played through to see all of the different endings, but I think I've seen enough to give an informed review.      The game plays a bit like a choose your own adventure novel.  You know, where you read through a scenario and are presented with choices.  Some lead good places, some don't.  I'll admit, the concept seemed like a lot of fun, and reviewers promised deep characterization and a compelling story.  Maybe I expected too much, but this game is underwhelming.  First, what it does well.  The characters are distinct from one another, and each feels different.  As I played, I definitely favored certain characters, and I tried my best to stick with them on my first play through.  Additionally, the story at times is well told, even gripping, and I can appreciate the care that went into the writing.  The game also presents the player with a variety of puzzles, and although you more or less have to approach each one the same way, no two are exactly alike.  It's also a lot of fun to interact with the environments while trying to solve the puzzles.  Most objects can be inspected, which forces the player to be thorough and really makes the process feel authentic.  Finally, the animations are excellent and help propel the story.    Now, what I feel the game does not do well.  Although the characters are distinct from one another, they are not believable.  Not a single one.  Even the protagonist acts, at times, in ways that do not fit the moment, which I found jarring since the player sees everything through his eyes.  I also found a lot of the dialogue and narration to be poorly written.  For as many polished moments as there are, there are easily twice as many moments where the writing seems like the product of a high school creative writing class.  It's not bad, but for those who rave about who well written the game is, it makes me wonder how much else they've ever actually read before.  The Grapes of Wrath 999 is not.  It's not even that I expected the writing to be outstanding, but I wanted it to be good enough to keep me in the story, and often it's not.  In a few places, it's actually laborious to get through.  I think what bothers me the most, however, is how little control you have over what happens.  My first play through, for example, I'd been playing for about 7 hours (real time, not necessarily game time) and was only presented with a few choices along the way.  You can imagine my frustration, then, when there was a moment when I definitely wanted a choice because I could see something was amiss but instead watched helplessly as the narration chugged along.  About 20 minutes later, I met a bad ending, which really irked me because I had sensed something was up but my character apparently was too clueless to see it and therefore bit it.  Ultimately, this is where the game really suffers.  The amount of choice you actually have is extremely limited, and for a game that is built on the premise of making choices, this problem is a fundamental one.    Is 999 bad?  No, it's decent and worth a play though.  Is 999 one of the best DS games?  Nope, not even close.  It's an interesting mix of novel and game, but since it doesn't handle either aspect especially well, it's a bit underwhelming.  Simply put, there are better games available, and there is better literature available.

B004FUPK3I|5.0|This Blu Ray edition of INFERNO is with no doubt the best ever on the market today. Gorgeous colors and accurate ones : it exactly reminded me the movie I had the chance to see in the theaters some years ago - which was not the case with the previous DVD. The sound is astonishing as well, giving Keith Emerson's music some grandeur (the final scene).   As for the film, for those who don't know yet the eerie world of INFERNO, just don't pay attention to the narration and logic, as there is few. INFERNO is a variation on fear, You just have to let yourself sweep away by the sounds, colors & flashes of macabre + violence in a very operatic way.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Dry wit, tough office politics, bad behaviour towards women, mix in a dash of cynicism for good measure and you've got the best television series ever seen.     Some episodes are so busy, it seems a miracle that that plots come together. In other episodes, nothing much happens. But what makes mad men so effective is the acting, pace and quality of the dialogue.     I don't want to tell you anything more about it, for fear of revealing too much.     You may think this is an over hyped series, but not until you sit down to watch it.
0756951410|4.0|Normally, I'm not the kind of person who reads a science fiction/fantasy or whatever you want to call this genre of book. I chose to read this book from people always telling me how good it was. Though it was hard for me to first get into the book, I eventually got really into it and truly liked it. I wasn't too fond of the whole girl in an `in-between heaven' but I liked how the author didn't really focus on this part of the plot as the story began to truly unfold.   I really enjoyed the murder mystery aspect of it. I can sit in front of the TV on Sundays and watch a whole marathon of Criminal Minds without getting bored so this was a huge positive of the book. It was interesting that the author allowed the reader to know who the killer was, but the whole novel revolved around the characters in the novel figuring it out for themselves. This made certain moments more suspenseful and gave the reader, and me especially, the desire to continue reading to see if they ever find out who murdered Susie.   I must say I am a sucker for happy endings. I like how the family is restored to its rightful place by the end. I especially enjoyed the realism Sebold uses when the mother comes back from California and the awkwardness that everyone feels. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a book to read. My only word of caution is that certain scenes contain pretty graphic imagery that could pose issues with some readers.
B0042816YK|4.0|I was actually quite impressed with this film, particularly in its depiction of India.     The film is very open minded and, when following Julia Roberts's character, does not make strong judgements about places or people.     My favourite part of the film was when the main character was in India and she meets Richard, an American with a dark secret. Its quite touching when he opens up and Elizabeth listens attentively without judging him.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Chocolat is a very interesting and different movie.  The scenery is very pretty and the town where it is filmed is novel.  Loved the story.  It is kind of like an old fairy tale.
0142403873|5.0|A wonderful story, that is complimented by lovely illustrations.     At times, the book seems so simple, you wish you had written it.     However, the simplicity is an indication of the author's skill in making it all look so easy.     Fantastic.
B00514HDNW|5.0|Matheson's I AM LEGEND has been made into three bad movies:<br /><br />THE LAST MAN ON EARTH starred Vincent Price. Made back in 1964, it's the most faithful of the adaptations, but hindered by a very low budget.<br /><br />THE OMEGA MAN starring Charlton Heston, 1971, could charitably be described as \\"based upon\\" I AM LEGEND. Worst of the bunch.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND the big budget action movie starring Will Smith (2007) was reasonably faithful in an \\"amp it up and blow it away\\" manner, but continued the tradition of totally missing the ending. Hint: To see what Matheson was getting at with the ending, look at the title!<br /><br />Anyway, the book remains one of my all-time favorites. It's still the only book I've ever finished and then immediately returned to page one to read again!<br /><br />If you're expecting a \\"zombie gross-out\\" or anything along those lines, you'll be disappointed. There's suspense a'plenty, but mainly it's a personal drama as Robert Neville strives to find meaning in a world in which he no longer belongs.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|This is a not a good movie for kids to watch. And Disney could have did so much better by the African-American's in this movie. It's not a good movie. And I wouldn't recommend showing this to my kid that's under 13 or any one for that matter.
0312370830|5.0|The theme of this book alternates between the tragic Holocaust years of 1942, and the present. The historical frame of reference is compelling and the ethical concerns raised by the story, are gripping.<br /><br />The author does a superb job at exposing the stress and anxiety of modern life, juxtaposed against past horrors. Most of the characters are well defined and engrossing as they are forced to navigate the difficult choices between good and evil. The issues of accountability and moral disgrace are handled in a thoughtful and insightful way.<br /><br />The book is an edgy, psychological drama about the Jewish experience in France during the Nazi occupation. It takes readers to a place of deep tragedy.<br /><br />This book will leave the reader feeling satisfied and fascinated. Read this book if you want to learn more about the Holocaust experience.<br /><br />Reviewed by: C.J. Good, Author [
B003Y5H54W|5.0|This movie is freakin awesome. It could use a little more romance though. Especially towards the end. But the end is like a mystery. I wish there was a kiss or something. But then again it kind of shows that Valerie and Henry will always be together. I read the book and the movie is way better. This is the second movie I have watched and its funny because both movies i have watched have Amanda Seyfried in it. And this one is way better than the book and its usually the other way around. Where the book is better than the movie. Such as the case with twilight.
0792835050|1.0|This movie is great.  unfortunately, I ordered a DVD and got a VHS.  Someone wasn't paying attention!!  I sent it back and still have not received a credit or the correct item.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Just simply for the fact that they made Thor into a real movie is awesome.  The movie could have done without so many comedic jabs, however the fight scenes make up for the movies slow part.
0756655730|5.0|Prehistoric Life is an excellent pictorial book in the area of paleontology.  It is filled to overflowing with illustrations, charts, etc., but don't let the \\"Visual History\\" (part of the subtitle) fool you.  The book is also inundated with plenty of good text - both technically informative for the serious student, yet very readable for the interested enthusiast.  The book is written from the typical evolutionary perspective.  It is organized in chronological accordance with the standard geologic timescale.  The lay-out makes it very easy to follow.  Please note that this work is quite comprehensive in its subject matter.  Despite the title, it deals with much more than just the successive appearances of organic life; it also deals with such matters as plate tectonics, climatology, etc.  The book does an excellent job of showing the standard uniformitarian interpretation of Earth history from the planet's beginning up to the present time of humanity.  This product is highly recommended.  It's just a good book to have around as both a quick reference and/or a tome for extended study.
B002ZG9800|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 3 1/2 stars<br /><br />This is a movie that I decided to watch twice as I was initially confused as to Jim Carrey's take on the character he plays--Steven Russell--the gay con artist who's now serving a life sentence in a Texas prison for a series of multiple con jobs which almost puts Bernie Madoff to shame (not quite in terms of monies embezzled but for the sheer style and inventiveness of the con jobs he pulls off). I found 'I love you Phillip Morris' a far more convincing portrait of gay characters than 'Brokeback Mountain' since the film's creators, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, appear to have no interest in promoting the dubious (and politically correct) stance that gay people in general have been perennially oppressed from time immemorial. Here, Carrey as Russell makes it quite clear that he's not ashamed of his gayness one bit. In perhaps the most surprising and clever scene in the entire film, Russell, enthusiastically engages in sexual intercourse and we expect it'll be a repeat of an earlier scene with his wife. But lo and behold, as the camera pulls back, we find that Russell is having anal sex with a man, as he proclaims via a voice-over that \\"I'm gay, gay, gay!\\".<br /><br />Not only should Carrey be commended for taking on the role of a gay person who has a real ego and no apparent guilt feelings about being gay but for also portraying a character who is almost completely amoral. Thus Russell is shown to be a rather complex character--not your usual gay 'victim' but rather an unrepentant victimizer! When Russell meets Phillip Morris in prison for the first time, he shows off his sensitive side by advising Phillip on how he can obtain social services for a critically ill AIDS patient Phillip has been trying to help. Later he sends some of his ill gotten gains to his ex-wife and daughter and seems genuinely interested in their welfare. But Russell is also an obsessive-compulsive character whose love for material things prevents him from feeling real empathy for others. Russell is like a pathological gambler who can never stop placing one more bet. And even his lover, Phillip, is simply one additional object he must reclaim, after it becomes clear that Phillip is no longer interested in him and his bizarre and brazen schemes to obtain Phillip's release, are no longer working.<br /><br />Carrey's take on Russell is always pretty much sympathetic. Some viewers may be put off by the elevation of a con man to such a sympathetic status but if Spielberg could do it in 'Catch me if you can', why can't it be done for a gay character here? The first third of the picture, however, is more an affectionate ribbing of a certain kind of gay lifestyle, than a more serious dissection of a certain kind of asocial, pathological behavior. Carrey goes a little too far into making Russell seem like a buffoon in the scene where he confronts his birth mother. The attempt at black humor when Russell continually advises a new inmate that the only way to get ahead in the prison environment is to perform oral sex, falls flat as the subject matter is more tragic than comic.<br /><br />The film really picks up as it examines Steven's and Phillip's relationship in prison. Ewan McGregor is excellent as Russell's boy toy and even displays a dark side (similar to Russell) when he approves of Russell's paying off an inmate in another cell block to beat up another inmate in their own cell block, whose been keeping Phillip awake every night by shrieking in a continuously loud and repetitive manner.<br /><br />Carrey is in best form when he poses as a lawyer and gains Phillip's release and then lucks out when a Judge approves a judgment for a friend of Phillip in civil court. Russell acquires untoward riches by defrauding a medical management firm after being hired as their chief financial officer.<br /><br />After Russell's scheme is uncovered, not only is he jailed but Phillip is arrested asan accomplice. This after Russell promised Phillip that his behavior at the medical management firm was above board. As we learn at the end of the film, Phillip actually does about seven years in prison as a result of Russell's machinations. So it's quite understandable that Phillip wants nothing to do with him by the film's end.<br /><br />For those who find that Russell's life sentence is excessive, consider this: Russell puts Phillip through unconscionable emotional pain by allowing him to believe that he's died of AIDS. Then he has the audacity to pull yet but another scheme, posing as an attorney again, and once again place the man he supposedly is in love with in jeopardy. Phillip slapping Russell in the face is wholly justified. It becomes clear that Russell's pathological behavior will never end and that promises to change are insincere. That perhaps is why it's best that Russell be incarcerated for the rest of his days is the right move (although 23 hours in solitary confinement may indeed be \\"cruel and unusual punishment\\").<br /><br />Ewan McGregor as Phillip has the best speech in the film when he speaks with Russell over the phone, believing that he's about to die of AIDS. He acknowledges in his own sick way, Russell did indeed love him but he could no longer maintain a relationship with him, as he knew that Russell would return to his manipulative and self-destructive ways.<br /><br />'I love you Phillip Morris' is one of those films worth viewing more than once. You'll find that it's a cautionary tale about naivety (Morris) and self-deception (Russell). Jim Carrey is not always successful in his portrayal of Russell, who may come off a tad bit too sympathetic. Nonetheless, Carrey must be praised for taking on the difficult role of an amoral and charismatic con man.his behavior at the medical management firm was above board.

0062060554|5.0|I don't hand out 5-star ratings lightly or often. But, this one for me just shone! Here's what I liked about it - with just a couple a minor nitpicks for those that might not have the same taste as I to help you decide if it's for you.<br /><br />SHORT SUMMARY: A woman that wakes up each morning with full-blown amnesia and has to be reminded about who she is, who her husband is and what her life is each day - starts keeping a secret diary.  The book is her diary of those few weeks as she works w/ a doctor who claims to want to help her and urged her to keep it. As she digs deeper into trying to find out who she really is and what happened to her to make her this way, she untangles a web of deceit. Who can she trust? Why are people lying to her? What really happened to her? Can she reclaim a real life?<br /><br />1. Great unique concept that's well done. Sure,we might have seen something similiar in the movies [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]] or more lightly in [[ASIN:B0001Z3TXE 50 First Dates (Widescreen Special Edition)]] - but it's still nothing like the way this one plays out.<br /><br />2. Making it only through the eyes of the amnesiac is brilliant, suspenseful and page-turning! I couldn't stop turning the pages - because it's written in a way that you are trying to figure out what is really going on with Chrissy - the amnesiac. Totally compelling.<br /><br />3. It's out and out well-written. The author has a gift for writing in a way that brings to life the complexities of the emotions and relationships of the characters. I'm astounded this is her debut.<br /><br />On the minor nitpicks:<br />1. I can see where women might enjoy this one far more than some men - because it is very relationship focused and it's a psychological rather than action-oriented thriller. It would truly make a great women's book club choice, and for me the writing is slightly reminiscent of Jodi Picoult.<br /><br />2. At the end - though the mystery that's been weaved is wrapped up soundly- there's a bit of a cliffhanger.  For me, it was a perfect and hopeful ending. Some might not enjoy that the author doesn't spell out for you what happens exactly to the main character afterwards.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended, especially for those that like a good, unique psychological thriller like  [[ASIN:031257357X Still Missing]] or are a fan of Jodi Picoult type tales.a perfect and hopeful ending.

The wait is over.    The production quality of the book is excellent. It's a 208-page hardcover that's slightly larger than A4 size. The drawings are reproduced very clearly. If you've seen the PDF copies that are floating on the internet, this is exactly that except in physical copy, right down to the number of words per line.    I love the text of the book. The tone is very encouraging and the instructions are always clear. The examples are beautifully illustrated. It's easy to follow along and learn.    This is a highly recommended book on figure drawing, a classic that gets mentioned frequently.
0441018866|3.0|This was my first Reynolds book and at first I found the pacing of the plot too slow for my tastes.  However, after the first 100 pages things heat up and Reynold's writing style keeps up with the big ideas he weaves into the storyline.  I agree with other assessments that the Gentian line characters seem hollow and under-developed. Ultimately, you don't end up caring for them enough to fully appreciate whether they live or die. The ending just didn't live up to my expectations and could be improved upon in my opinion.  The cloning and star-faring concepts taking place over millions of years is aslo a little hard to swallow from a human biology perspective, but it's big ideas like this that keep us looking to the stars.  Overall, I enjoyed the book and will probably read more of his work.
B00275EHJG|4.0|The toys finally return after 1999's Toy Story 2 movie, but which is rare for 3 movies to have good reviews animated or not. It is rare for 3 films to be this strong, even without running out of gas at some point, how many can say that? There are a of returning toys, and then some new toys including Barbie getting her Ken. Or does she I am going to leave it up to you to find out. And seeing this being a Disney-PIXAR film, I was expecting this to get and win for best animated feature film, these films seem to be a lock for it. While I am lost to tell you what I liked best about this film, I can tell you do things that I didn't lkike the film, there are a couple. One I didn't like and that I was hoping that it wasn't going to, but did anyways the words idiot and moron are used in the film. But I realized that they used in the first 2 movies they had either one or both the words in the movies. The movie opens with the toys in a western opening scene with some of them good guys and others like Hamm on the bad guys. Then they have a montage of Andy growing up. Then we get to really the present of the movie where Andy ( voiced by John Morris) is now 17 years old, and now is getting set to leave home for college. And he stills lives with his mom and kid sister, Molly that we also get to see more grown up. The toys are now bound for his toy chest, or the ones that are left over, including Woody (Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Jessie the Cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Slinky Dog (Blake Clark replacing the late Jim Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), and the Potato Heads Mr. and Mrs. (Don Rickles and Estelle Harris). The toy soliders are still around, lead by Sarge (R. Lee Ermey)  decide their time is up, and time to leave, before they end up in garbage bags. All the rest of the toys are not in the film, but the film does mention 2 of the toys tat are gone, but never really explains what happened to them, other then they had gone missing. Or even gone onto better owners. So while the toys place a phone call on a phone to Andy, whose cell phone is in with the toys, just hoping to be played with again. But Andy has pretty much grown up, and he believes and warns his baby sister Molly (Beatrice Miller), about staying out of his room. Then his Mom (Laurie Metcalf) tells Andy that it is time to clean his room, which includes packing up for garbage, throwing trash out. And which includes his toys, that they either have to be packed away for college, or put in the attic or they will be thrown away. And he does it, he places all but Woody in Trash bags, meaning to take them up to the attic. Woody is packed in the box for college, but gets out, and Andy is about to put the bag of toys in the attic, when he leaves them on the floor, and the doors closes itself for the attic, to help Molly out, and his Mom finds the bag and assumes it is garbage. The big problem, the only toy that really saw what happened is Woody, and when he finds the rest of the toys, once they have been taken to the garbage. But they mange to sneak into her car, and along with Molly's old toys, they are donated to a daycare named Sunnyside. Where they are welcomed by Lots-O'Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty ) who turns out to be the movie, and we also meet Ken (Ned Beatty).   They are assigned to a room with the toddlers, which leads to playtime that they didn't expect or want. The rest of the movie I am going to leave up to you. One other problem I do have with the movie, there is not a whole lot of new music in this movie, there is only one new song that plays during the end credits, and I really don't think that it is memorable enough, or good enough for Best Original Song, which it got nominated for and one, the only other song that plays during the movie is You've got a Friend in Me once again sung by Randy Newman.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Battery arrived in timely fashion. It works, but my camera doesn't....error code 99! Am working to get that resolved. Otherwise Canon still rocks and Amazon is where you will get the best deal (most of the time.) HeHe!!
0439023483|5.0|I'm not really sure what I can say about this book that hasn't already been said.  It's disturbing, it's violent, it's graphic, it's uncomfortable and it's scary.  But it's also FANTASTIC!!!  I would even go so far as to say the best book I've read in over a year.  I'm not normally one for books that are so raw and in your face like this one.  But I've already read this for a second time... just this week!  The emotions it makes you feel are so intense.  The main character is a strong, smart young woman and let's face it, there aren't a lot of those out there is YA fiction lately.  You'll find yourself rooting for her throughout the whole book.  Then when the book ends you will be racing to get the second one because it's just that good!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. Concept is real easy to understand. Graphics and sound are not shabby either. Had no issues playing on froyo 2.2. Keep up the good work ! Game kept me busy for hours. Only wish was if we could save our progress. I had to reset my device and had backup my data using backup pro but still lost all my achievements.
0439023513|3.0|Let me just say that if you don't sit and think too much about the story, then it's fantastic!  I've had a bit to think about it though and I'm kind of disappointed.      ***SPOILERS***    In this book I expected Katniss to have grown leaps and bounds.  Especially by the time her mission to the Capitol begins.  That hasn't happened.  She seems to be the same pawn she started out being.  Only now instead of being the Capitol's pawn (as all of the tributes were) she's the rebel's pawn.    The end of the book, the thing we wait practically the whole series for..... Snow's death.  It's completely taken away from Katniss and from ME!!!  I had so many different ideas of how this could happen.  When I read it my jaw just dropped.  What an anticlimactic way to go.  I don't know if it's because Katniss can tell Snow is dying or if she's being manipulated by him or what.  Unfortunately, it feels like the later.    The the last page... really, that's how we find out who Katniss chooses.  It felt like a last minute addition to an already finished book.  The last 2 or 3 chapters felt completely rushed.  I would've loved for the book to be another 50 pages or so and feel like this part wasn't a complete afterthought.  I'm complaining a lot, I know.  After the first 2 books I guess my expectations were just too high to be delivered on.  :(
B00003CXBH|5.0|This is a very good movie with a different take on Denaro. Based on a true story if you're into history. The end leaves you thinking \\"what would I have done?\\"
0439023491|4.0|The last 2/3 of this book were fantastic.  Especially the end!  I could even say especially the last sentence.  WOW!!!  My problem was with the first part.  It was kind of slow.  I'd even go so far as to say boring.  I don't know if it's because I started this book right after finishing THG and was still on a high from that or what.  But never fear... the good stuff comes, I promise!  Katniss, our main character and Peeta's relationship evolves and we learn more about her relationship with Gale too.  Great another love triangle, right?  I've been getting sick of that in YA fiction lately but it's really not as bad as it sounds.  We also learn more about the evil Capitol and even more evil President Snow.  I'm not going into the plot.  I'll just say make sure you have Mockingjay on hand because you'll want to start it as soon as you finish the last page of Catching Fire.
B003I5MGGA|4.0|I have seen quite a few adaptations of shakespeare, and many of them by other directors than Zeffirelli.  In my opinion, Zeffirelli's adaptations are the best because of the realism he brings to the productions.  His talent for casting the right actors for the principle, as well as peripheral roles, is almost unsurpassed.  In addition, the acting style presents the themes and storyline in a manner that speaks to contemporary audiences, regardless of the language boundaries of Elizabethan English.  Due to the intensity of emotion, and realistic character portrayal, one is apt to forget that they are watching Shakespeare, and simply focus on the problems faced by two teenagers in love amidst a bloodfeud fought by their two families.       This is a good film, and showcases the talents of such actors as Michael York, and Olivia Hussey, as well as Milo O'Shea (who many may remember from Sidney Lumet's film The Verdict).  Overall, a very entertaining film about a tragic love affair and what becomes of two feuding families in the aftermath.  I give this film a rating of four stars, but only because Zeffirelli was still honing his craft in the late 1960's.  A five star rating is reserved for Zeffireli's production of Hamlet, starring Mel Gibson and Glen Close.  For those who have not seen it, it is another that I highly recommend.
B004UBM4TA|5.0|We first saw this at an IMAX theater, and just had to buy it. We just purchased our 3-D TV a couple of weeks ago, and wanted to buy one that would be beautiful, and this fit the bill! What a great purchase!
B004VD3PE0|5.0|Besides the order being remarkably on time the book itself was a fantastic read and i could honestly not put it down! To anyone buying this book you will enjoy it simply because its an emotional roller coaster that will keep you on your toes until the last page =)
0553386794|5.0|Another 5-star review for Game of Thrones, which is quite possibly the second-best fantasy series ever written, with only Lord of the Rings being (slightly) better.<br /><br />Even if you do not care for the Fantasy genre, there is plenty to enjoy in this series, especially if appreciate great story telling and the history of the middle ages/knights in armor appeal to you.<br /><br />For a really great review that will tell you exactly what you are getting into, should you decide to read Game of Thrones, read the 5-star review posted May 9, 2001 by MISTER SJEM \\"sonofhotpie\\".  Now, that's a great review of a great book.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie is about how people need to live life to the fullest because you never know when your time is.  It is funny, romantic, and sincere.  Make sure you have from scratch chocolate chip cookies on hand and ice cold milk, trust me, you will need it!
0811821846|4.0|This is a good book for my daughter's birthday. The product description says there is 132 pages. When I received the book, I found out it is only 60 pages. I did a complete search on other sites and found this is mostly listed as 60 pages. Amazon did send me another one to see if it was something wrong at the warehouse but it came in the same with 60 pages and I returned it to them. I kept this first one even though there was a error on how many pages was listed.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't find enough time to sit down and read it. It was a rollercoaster of emotions which kept me wanting more. Two close friends said that this was their favorite JP book and I have to agree. Happy reading!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|To all of you people that gave this movie a bad rating and said it was horrible. What do you want, another Twilight? The same movie over and over again? The special effects alone deserve five stars. It has an original story and plot and I've never seen anything quite like it. If you like sci fi movies then you will like this one. Just buy it and don't listen to these people that critic every little thing or compare it to Avatar.
031261246X|3.0|This debut technothriller by one of Microsoft's technical gurus features al-Qaeda, cyber-terrorism on a global scale, a network security hero who lost his lady in 9/11 (which, he happened to predict while working for the CIA, only to be ignored), and not one, but two other exceedingly attractive female IT people. What else does one need to know? While the author posits some fairly evocative set pieces illustrating how the world's economy can be brought to a standstill by a few relatively clever and dedicated hackers (an oil tanker guidance system crashing, an jetliner's computerized controls failing, computerized dam controls failing, etc.), the characters are cut from the shoddiest cardboard stock imaginable, and no thriller cliche goes unused along the way. There's a corrupt U.S. government official, a ruthless hitman who somehow can't quite manage to finish off the hero, the friend-turned-love-interest, and on and on. The villain's plan for using a distributed, anonymous network of hackers to do their dirty work is actually pretty compelling and instructive, but that's pretty much the best idea in the book. Otherwise, far too much time is spent with characters hunched over computers examining code, or -- more implausibly -- racing around the world to track down the hackers responsible. It's not a very good mix, but I suppose it works as a crude cautionary tale and the writing is probably no worse than any number of thrillers people will be reading on the beach this summer.

B004XIQIPQ|4.0|Alex Turner has a thing for candy. You see, there is a candy shop in the UK called Mr. Humbug, and their slogan is \\"suck it and see\\". Alex has been fixated on that shop since he sang about strawberry lace on \\"Crying Lightning\\". Now with their newest release he's decided to sweeten up his lyrics and tone down the acerbic sounds of their last album. (coincidentally titled \\"Humbug\\")  What I found interesting about this album was the fact that I didn't need multiple listens to get into it. Most of these songs have easy to enjoy melodies and lyrics. However not everything is great in candy land.    The first song \\"She's Thunderstorms\\" fools you into believing that this is going to be a powerful song once Matt pounds down his intro, but it levels off and doesn't really go anywhere. Alex continues to impress with a great retro '60's melody but the chorus is just too sweet and sugary which is fine on occasion but with this album your teeth will rot.    Next comes \\"Black Treacle\\" A catchy tune with more fantastic lyrics from Alex \\"I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer\\". This is what pop music is all about. A song that can change a bad day into something more bearable. By the way Mr. Humbug makes a great black treacle. You should try it. ok. I'm just kidding about that last part.    \\"Brick by Brick\\" is the least creative song on the album. Why they decided to throw this b-side filler on right after such a fantastic song is a crime. The song really is only 30 seconds long and stretched into three minutes by few lousy backing vocal \\"ahhs\\" and a slowed down tempo near the end.   What's so amazing is that this group has tons of yet to be released songs that are ten times better. (I'm still waiting for a studio version of \\"Put me in a terror pocket\\") Was this to be Matt's break out hit? who knows.    \\"The Hellcat Spangled sha la la\\". I've read many reviews that point to this song as their best song on the album. I'm having a little trouble with that. Although it is a pleasant song, Jamie's guitar just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the song. Why does Jamie always use the same echo and reverb effects on quieter tunes like this? There are so many other sounds you can get from that guitar Jamie.    \\"Don't sit down 'cause I moved your Chair\\" This song reminds me of \\"Crying Lightning\\" only with better lyrics and a crunchier sound. A nice loud song to get into but is still lacking a kick-ass chorus or a middle eight.    \\"Library Pictures\\" recalls the manic sounds of there early recordings when alex's vocals would get your blood flowing. I like the \\"Godzilla\\" riff and how the song never stays in the same direction. It's too bad that it clocks in at less then two and a half minutes but I can live with that.     \\"All my own stunts\\" keeps up the flow of the last two songs with alex experimenting a little with melodies and guitar riffs. This song may need a few listens but it is guaranteed to grow on you with each playback.    \\"Reckless Serenade\\" begins another change of direction which continues through to the end of the album. Not quite as catchy as Mr. Turners other retrospective love songs but I like the beauty of it. One thing I notice with this album is that Nick O'Malley has finally woke up and is more melodic in his playing.    \\"Piledriver Waltz\\" This is Alex at his best lyrically but not quite as good as the original version from the \\"Submarine\\" EP. Here we get the same echo/reverb again from Jamies guitar.    \\"Love is a Laserquest\\" is another retro style song with some great drumming and bass, but here is Jamie again with that same echo/reverb. there is a nice guitar break near the end that makes up for it.     \\"Suck it and See\\" is a great song. It really is. Musically and lyrically. It would have been a pop hit if it wasn't already written by other groups such as U2 or REM, which is a shame. I really love this song even though musically it isn't very original.    The album closes with \\"That's Where Your Wrong\\" This songsounds straight from the \\"Breakfast Club\\" soundtrack. An 80's style take on \\"A certain Romance\\".    My review may sound a little harsh, but overall the album isn't that bad. James Ford's production is better then Josh Homme's any day of the week. Alex continues to grow as a songwriter and you have to give these guys credit for taking their albums into different directions.
B000002UWF|5.0|Louis Prima was one of a kind and this collection shares why.  It is a lot of fun to listen to; full of beat, humor, and rhythm.  You either like this music or you don't.  Great energy music.  I listen to it when rowing or biking when I really want to max out my efforts.      The disk is loaded with music that all sounds great, like you are right there in the club with Louis.  Worth every penny.
0553582038|2.0|Having just read the last three books in rapid succession I was so surprised the shift that took place in this fourth book.  From not being able to put it down and being thrilled or horrified at each new revelation to being bored. I felt too much was spent on people talking about what had happened, eating, complaining about the weather and planning to do something.  Jamie a main character that went through a huge change both physically and mentally is mostly just he victim of jokes and reiteration of his loss, his sister who at first I was thrilled to think we get her point of view remains two dimensional and all the additional characters for the Island kingdom where unappealing and dull.  It was as if Martin just decided to deny us the stories we wanted. Arya I could have spent the book with her!  Or Jaime if they let hi be more then a victim.  I had this feeling the whole time that Martin was just holding back, not willing to give us anything so he could have all the revelations later.  And with the next book the other half of this one I worry it too will be hints and promises and not substance.  This author and can do SO MUCH better.  But editing some of the fluff for a shorter  more entertaining book would have made this so much more appealing.  I skimmed a lot when I recognized the themes... oh here is the Samwell being scared and traveling, oh here is Cersie being paranoid, here is Jaime again seeing what he lost...       If you are a fan of the series you probably have to read this book. Or read a synopsis and hope for better next time. I do worry Martin might not have a clear course for his epic and with the TV series I don't see it ever ending with resolution or characters that we know and care about still standing.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this stuff. Beat it and still playing trying to get all the accomplishments going the second time around.
0515141429|1.0|I read all of the five star reviews, then a trusted friend loaned me this book and recommended it.  Still, I had modest expectations.  I may strangle my friend.  This book is one of the worst I have ever read, and I read a great deal of crime fiction.  I hardly know where to begin.  The plot holes have been aptly pointed out in other one star reviews.  The writing style, and indeed personality of Reacher, is best described as \\"sophomoric.\\"  Perhaps Child is trying to tap into the literate pre-teens who are graduating from Harry Potter to werewolf/vampire fiction.  No intelligent adult who reads anything other than the Sunday Comics would enjoy this novel.  Its only saving grace is that the print is large and one can easily skim entire pages without missing anything, so even at 500+ pages, it is a mercifully quick read.

1572816112|5.0|When I first opened the Deviant Moon Tarot, I was blown away. I had expected that after the first few cards, they would all begin to blend in together, just more of what I'd already seen. Card after card, I was surprised and delighted at every spectacular new image. I have never been more fascinated and impressed with a deck.<br /><br />Valenza shares some of his creative process in the LWB: \\"The Deviant Moon Tarot deck was created using various forms of photographic manipulation. Each card began with a complete drawing, which was then scanned into the computer where I applied various photographic textures. Nineteenth-century tombstones provide most of the clothing worn by the citizens of the Deviant Moon. I bent, twisted, and reformed my photos to become capes, boots, hats and trim. One of the best aspects of creating the deck was 'hunting' for specific textures as I respectfully tiptoed around the graveyards of eastern Long Island, New York. Background buildings were created with photographs I took of a local abandoned insane asylum. Rotted doors, windows and walls became castles, factories and cities.\\"<br /><br />The magic of this deck is in its ability to captivate and lure you into this fascinating world. Many times when I'm looking at a deck that strays from traditional RWS imagery, I tend to see flashes in my mind of the RWS equivalent meanings as a comparison. While the Deviant Moon doesn't follow traditional imagery, as soon as I look at one of the cards, I automatically know what card it is, and I've found that before my mind is able to flash to the RWS \\"meaning\\" in my head, the artwork forces me to bypass that step, as it pulls me in further and asks more of me. I am drawn to delve deeper into the card, experiencing additional layers of meaning.<br /><br />There is some talk among the tarot community of this deck being really dark. I don't see it that way at all, and when communicating with the artist, he confirmed that it wasn't ever intended to be a dark deck. He explained that it was based on his childhood imagination, a twisted world which is at times a bit melancholy, yet includes elements of humor as well. After working with the deck myself, I can definitely attest to the fact that the images inspire imagination. The characters, for the most part, aren't maniacal or creepy. They are unique and engaging, and not without emotion. I find the artwork captivating and intriguing, though I do not consider it a dark deck.<br /><br />The cards themselves are longer than the average tarot deck, which can make repeated shuffling uncomfortable. I do like the dimensions of the deck, with the length being unusually longer than the width, but it would have been nice if the cards were a little easier to handle, keeping the same dimensions, but making the cards a bit smaller. I'm a big fan of trimming borders off of decks, and doing so would make this one easier to handle, but I think the white borders actually help keep this deck from appearing too dark (literally dark in coloring, not figuratively speaking).<br /><br />Valenza's use of color is striking and leads your eyes on a parade around each card, so that you notice the smallest details, down to the color of toenail polish on the characters' feet.<br /><br />The Aces in this deck really stand out, as they are extremely elaborate. Rather than featuring the usual solitary symbol of a cup, wand, sword or pentacle, the Deviant Moon Aces are fully illustrated with characters.<br /><br />The Death card is the only Major Arcana card which isn't titled. (I believe this is inspired by Marseille tradition.)<br /><br />Each suit is comprised of a different theme, though they come together seamlessly. In a forum post at Aeclectic Tarot, Valenza writes:<br /><br />\\"Swords are angst ridden beings set in a medieval world... Cups are people comprised of fish parts as well as gravestones... Wands are folks with a tribal, peasant mix, whose bodies are blended with insects and leaves... Pentacles are based on decayed industry...circa 1890's ish...\\"<br /><br />The originality of Valenza's mastering and blending his artwork with tarot is stunning. I am completely enchanted by the Wands suit of this deck. Ordinarily, it's visually my least favorite suit. This deck has made me love Wands, and that's no small feat! In fact, this deck features so many cards that immediately stood out as my favorite version from any deck, due to their original portrayal.<br /><br />My least favorite card? The Hermit. The Hermit is usually one of my very favorite cards in a deck, and one of the first I seek out when looking through a new deck. So I was a bit disappointed initially that the hermit in this deck is depicted as a tortured soul who appears to be on the brink of madness. That's not at all how I think of the Hermit, so this deviation from one of my favorite cards was really the only one that I wasn't thrilled about. However, upon further reflection, I now see more into it. I don't think this soul is tortured by the solitude, but rather tortured into solitude. I think it is the pressures and insanity of society that has driven him (and drives us) to seek solitude, as though he'll go mad unless he can get away from it all for awhile. Looking at it that way enabled me to relate much more comfortably with this card. Even my least favorite card was transformed into understanding when I allowed myself to look deeper. And that is the true beauty of this deck.<br /><br />When reading with this deck, once the initial overview is clear, the images then draw me in further to elaborate and refine the reading. When laid out, the cards flow together so well and tell stories as though the artist had designed those cards you selected to specifically go together.<br /><br />The Little White Book which accompanies the Deviant Moon is deck-specific and written by the artist. Both the Majors and Minors feature commentary on the cards by Valenza. He also includes an introduction in which he shares details on the creation of the deck. There is a 10-card spread included called The Lunatic Spread, which is appropriately moon-shaped. Six blank pages for notes pull up the rear of the LWB.<br /><br />*Premier Edition*: The Spread Sheet included with the Premier Edition is custom designed for the Deviant Moon Tarot, and displays The Lunatic Spread from the LWB. Spread sheet measures approximately 17\\" x 20\\" and folds up for easy storage.<br /><br />It should be glaringly obvious how enchanted by and enamored I am of the Deviant Moon Tarot. The originality of this deck far exceeds any other I've seen, and the power it has to draw you into the world of imagination is amazing.<br /><br />Suits: Cups, Wands, Swords, Pentacles<br />Court Titles: Page, Knight, Queen, King<br />Justice/Strength: Justice 8, Strength 11<br />Cards: 78<br />Card Size: 2 3/4\\" x 5 1/8\\"<br />Card stock: Glossy (heavily laminated) *I have the original glossy deck, printed in Italy*<br />Backs: Reversible<br />Border: 1/8\\" outer white border, 1/16\\" inner color-coded border<br />Deck-specific LWB: Yes (written by Valenza)<br />Deck-specific Spread Sheet: Yes (in the Premier Edition)<br /><br />(See my blog for images of the cards and readings I've done with this deck.)<br /><br />~Kiki (TarotDame.com)iginality of Valenza's mastering and blending his artwork with tarot is stunning.

The Little White Book which accompanies the Deviant Moon is deck-specific and written by the artist. Both the Majors and Minors feature commentary on the cards by Valenza. He also includes an introduction in which he shares details on the creation of the deck. There is a 10-card spread included called The Lunatic Spread, which is appropriately moon-shaped. Six blank pages for notes pull up the rear of the LWB.    *Premier Edition*: The Spread Sheet included with the Premier Edition is custom designed for the Deviant Moon Tarot, and displays The Lunatic Spread from the LWB. Spread sheet measures approximately 17\\" x 20\\" and folds up for easy storage.    It should be glaringly obvious how enchanted by and enamored I am of the Deviant Moon Tarot. The originality of this deck far exceeds any other I've seen, and the power it has to draw you into the world of imagination is amazing.    Suits: Cups, Wands, Swords, Pentacles  Court Titles: Page, Knight, Queen, King  Justice/Strength: Justice 8, Strength 11  Cards: 78  Card Size: 2 3/4\\" x 5 1/8\\"  Card stock: Glossy (heavily laminated) *I have the original glossy deck, printed in Italy*  Backs: Reversible  Border: 1/8\\" outer white border, 1/16\\" inner color-coded border  Deck-specific LWB: Yes (written by Valenza)  Deck-specific Spread Sheet: Yes (in the Premier Edition)    (See my blog for images of the cards and readings I've done with this deck.)    ~Kiki (TarotDame.com)
B0054EZ6JM|1.0|The Almost People is an episode that focuses on the idea that a new race of people can have the same emotions and rights as humans even if they were accidentally created. This concept is not new to Doctor Who and has been explored effectively in earlier episodes. But here, the characters repeatedly act idiotic and refuse to get what really is a simple concept. Even Amy and Rory, who have been exposed to and grasped all manner of mind-bending ideas, have difficulty with this even when it is spelled out for them. Worse,the massage of the episode is actually contradicted by the outcome and by the doctor himself when the Gangers are treated by the plot as more expendable than their human counterparts and those who survive are essentially told that its because they can now pass as humans. Instead of celebrating a new race, and exploring their new life they are relegated to emulating the \\"superior race\\" and attempting to \\"pass as normal.\\" Its also possible that the Doctor himself killed a Ganger without any regard for its life, though what actually happened to that Ganger is up for debate. Overall the episode tries to send a message that it directly contradicts and does it by following the incorrect assumption that intelligent audiences enjoy watching people act stupidly. It would have been so much more interesting to see a character not only accept the situation but have fun with it. Characters we have learned to respect suddenly become dull, moronic, calloused and possible completely evil. This season of Doctor Who has, like the previous one, been opening up new possibilities and exploring intelligent characters and themes. This episode derails that adventure and leaves the audience wondering how they are supposed to respect these characters again.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|There is a Great Wall of ice, under-maintained, which protects the 7 kingdoms from unspeakable horrors to the north. Below the wall there are 7 kingdoms vying to possess a throne usurped by a wrongful heir in a setting as authentically medieval as it is cruel and power mad. And across the Narrow Sea, the heirs of the last rightful king gather an army of barbarians to bring them home. Let the Game begin!<br /><br />This TV series, which has been more successful for HBO internationally than [[ASIN:B002OID4VS The Sopranos: The Complete Series]], is based upon the cycle of books in A Song of Ice and Fire. The TV series takes its name from the first book, and each season is planned to represent one book from the cycle of 7 total (two yet unwritten). Unlike a TV series like The Sopranos, this means you may already know what to expect when you sit down to watch. If TV is your first look at this story, you're missing much - my analogy is watching a sports game without knowing the players by jersey number. You will still enjoy the game but your viewing will be casual. The books are ripping good so I recommend them as well.<br /><br />The novels in this cycle: [[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]], [[ASIN:B0032FMR92 A Clash of Kings [Book #2 A Song of Ice and Fire] (HARDCOVER)]], [[ASIN:B004R10AQW A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3) By George R. R. Martin]], [[ASIN:B003T46QA2 A Feast for Crows. Book 4 of Ice and Fire]] and [[ASIN:0553801473 A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]] have all been praised as a realistic character-driven fantasy story.<br /><br />The biggest problem the TV series has is with recording the passage of time. Each episode goes over events without a set period of time delineated. Time varies from scene to scene and episode to episode. Ravens can fly only so fast, of course. Perhaps this matters most to people who have not read the book. As the novel has been serialized for TV, the typical plodding minutiae of follow-along soap opera is removed. (This series makes the case for the old 26-episode per season schedule from TV's Golden Age.) Another limitation to the medium is the TV budget, averaging to a whopping $6 million per episode. That's not much money, however, for epic cinematic storytelling. So, do not expect to trade soap opera pacing for lots of [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]] set piece battle sequences. (George R. R. Martin, the story's author, has been contracted by HBO to write the season 2 episode with the big battle so that may underline the limitations that even the author will have to struggle with for TV.)<br /><br />And those are the two main negatives in my review of content.  The story is epic, sweeping, exciting and intellectual. It is to fantasy writing what [[ASIN:0141194057 The Great Gatsby]] is to the American novel, and the TV series faithfully translates the work from one medium to the other within its given limitations.<br /><br />I had the privilege to view the first two episodes in a cinema recently and I noticed things on the big silver screen I had not on the idiot box. The cinematography is brilliant. The writing bears repeatedly scrutiny as much is packed between the lines and within the lines than what is typical for TV. The writing is laser superb. I also think the episodes I viewed were extended cuts, which I will be looking for along with the many extras released on the Internet, in the official DVD release.<br /><br />Episode # - Title - Internet Run Time (in minutes) opening to closing credits:<br />01 - Winter is Coming - 61.35<br />02 - The Kingsroad - 55.15<br />03 - Lord Snow - 57.12<br />04 - Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things - 55.36<br />05 - The Wolf and The Lion - 54.14<br />06 - A Golden Crown - 52.34<br />07 - You Win or You Die - 57.56<br />08 - The Pointy End (scripted by the novelist) - 58.08<br />09 - Baelor - 56.14<br />10 - Fire And Blood - 52.35<br /><br />On the topic of gratuitous sex and nudity, I did not find any. However, by watching this series, the uninitiated viewer will learn that women do not leap from bed clinging to bed sheets and men's genitalia bounce when running. You won't see any labia. One character operates a franchise of whorehouses where the women are not Julia Roberts but more like skilled factory girls. There is the use of the word fcuk, and it is very [[ASIN:0198611862 The Oxford English Dictionary (20 Volume Set) (Vols 1-20)]] usage correct. No one fades to unconscious black at a pure kiss before bedding time. Now, while I think that has more artistic merit than brutish demonstrations, I do think the brutish demonstrations serve their place here. It sets a tone that our civilized mores have robbed from us.<br /><br />In the mid-15th century, girls younger than 10 were married off; impregnated by 13; and old maids by 16. The act of copulation was to please men and male Gods. The man was rare who was concerned with whether the woman had her climax before he was finished. Women were chattel who could not possess property or power. Oaths were contracts of blood. Lawyers wielded axes... All this stuff that we have forgotten is definitely alive in this series as an accurate reflection of its time. Now, all that medieval framework laid, I must say the women are far from helpless furniture and the characters shine brighter among the darkness of their time.<br /><br />So it comes down to what you want to focus on while watching; and Parental Guidance is not so much a suggestion as it is an opportunity for parents with this series.<br /><br />Your mileage may vary, of course. But for those who expect Cyrano de Bergerac courtly love making, I recommend the purchase of [[ASIN:B0006B2A6U Ivanhoe]] instead of Game of Thrones. Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe was another inspiration for the author after all.<br /><br />== My Original Review to be Deleted After I Complete My Review of the DVDs ==<br /><br />First, it needs to be said that the DVD has not yet been packaged or released.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is a good movie and Amazon delivered as promised. Highly recommended if you are a fan of the series.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I wasted a lot of time playing this. It is fun and the achievements are fun after you are done with the adventure.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game.  Plays super smooth on my Defy, and Desire HD.  Anyone who complains about it slowing their phone they either have too many things bogging it down, or a phone that can't handle it in the beginning anyway.  Don't blame the game.  Loads fast, plays fast, closes fast.  Oh did I mention it's super addictive and fun?  Why yes.  Yes it is!
B002UXRGLG|4.0|Pros: Absolutely amazing footage.  Narration turns each section into a story.  Appeals to multiple ages.  Runs the gamut from unbelievably cute (baby seals) to rather gruesome (baby seals being eaten).  My kids (10-22) tell their friends about it.  Cons: Focuses almost entirely on vertebrates (although, to be fair, one whole episode is insects, and an octopus makes a showing), and it makes not the slightest attempt to survey the classes and orders on which it does focus.  I took away a whole star simply because I wanted it to be 5x or 10x longer.  If you think that's grossly unfair, then consider this a 5-star item.    Summary: Don't use this as a substitute for studying your biology textbook!  It's not intended for that.  But it succeeds wonderfully at presenting vignettes (sometimes jaw-dropping) of the kinds of creatures most people think of when they hear \\"Life.\\"  It will whet your appetite for more in-depth study.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|The events of the financial summer of 2008 are epic; this movie captures not only the historical but also the emotional. The telling is brilliant for both the knowledgeable and the spectator; it is done effortlessly and treats the viewer to excellent performances.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|These cards are very stiff to shuffle and stick together when wet.  The plastic clip which holds them together is difficult to open far enough to collect them.  As someone else recommended, I will buy a metal binder ring to keep them together.  Nonetheless, this is an excellent innovation for a highly educational and addictive game, and we love to use it in the bath, the pool, etc.  My son learned how to play when he was four, and he still plays regularly three years later at school and at home, with family and his friends.
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|The Chemical Brothers have created perhaps my favorite soundtrack of all time for the movie Hanna, a combination of thumping techno songs in a pure dream state.<br /><br />HANNA'S THEME<br />For a song that starts out like a nursery rhyme, angels harmonizing vocally while playing a xylophone, it quickly ends up as psychotic ballerina.  Could have easily been used for the weirder scenes of Black Swan.  A benign bedtime song for those who have not seen the film, the calm before the storm who have.  The storm of a deadly little girl about to seek revenge by leaving corpses in her wake like so much trash.<br /><br />ESCAPE 700<br />The first minute builds up like roller coaster excitement from Frankenstein's lab, in preparation of a somewhat repetitious thrill ride for nearly two minutes, until the clink-clank of the coaster's gears allow the front car to peak over the edge of a massive descent into a heart-pumping, energy-draining finish.  Odd, however, is the last minute.  It's a complete waste of sounds from a SETI experiment.<br /><br />THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS<br />The innocent, pleasant beginning, like absorbing the tunes atop a Ferris Wheel at a small town carnival.  It brilliantly belies its own cinematic context.  Its usage in Hanna is attached to a creepy German guy in a track suit who whistles the tune while either A) thinking of torturing and murdering people, or B) torturing and murdering people.  Combine the song with the actions and it morphs into background music to which psychedelic, animatronic characters on Disney World rides randomly snatch children and pull limbs from sockets.  To put it another way, this is probably the song Bjork wants played nonstop at her funeral.  Comprised primarily of a less ominous jingle similar to Twisted Nerve's contribution on the Kill Bill soundtrack, this tune will be whistled by 90% of the people who watch Hanna.  Truly mesmerizing.<br /><br />THE FOREST<br />If this isn't a recording of whales beat-boxing, then I know no other way to describe it.  Odd addition.<br /><br />QUASIDE SYNTHESIS<br />If there were one song on the soundtrack that would work well as movie serial killer background (e.g. Jason, Freddy), this would be it.  This short song is danger lurking around the corner.<br /><br />THE SANDMAN<br />Much like Hanna's Theme, this song's intro is bells and childlike, perfect for a bunny jumping around in a fairy tale.  Eventually, however, it's erodes into nightmarish organ music that had me looking around corners for Nosferatu and a bloody rabbit.<br /><br />MARISSA FLASHBACK<br />While I've heard others rave about this addition, I was not impressed overall.  The intro is bells and brass, but about 30 seconds in there's TV static and ocean waves.  Another 45 after that sounds like the rhythm is being kept by an uneven dryer in the laundry room.<br /><br />BAHNHOF RUMBLE<br />Played during a battle in an underground subway, this hollow, minimalistic song doesn't hold up well on its own, but during the scene it's epic.  It exudes the feel of underground subway stations (i.e. Bahnhof) worldwide, with knocks and bumps echoing off stone pillars while speeding trains look on uncaringly.<br /><br />THE DEVIL IS IN THE BEAT<br />Maybe too techno for some, \\"The Devil is in the Beats\\" is a head-bobbing tune with razor sharp synthesizers and a booming drum set that is absolutely entrancing.  Portions could easily be described as a car alarm on acid.  Heard only during the credits of the movie, the song is a treat for movie fanatics.  What makes it especially memorable is the usage of the creepy whistling of \\"The Devil is in the Details,\\" and shoves it dead center into the harshest, grittiest, bass-heavy portions of the absolutely brilliant composition.  The drastic changes are brain-rebooting eardrum arrows bullying listeners into corners and forcing them to prepare for the next precipitous audio assault.  Easily my favorite of the soundtrack.<br /><br />CAR CHASE<br />Comparedto the rest of the soundtrack, this sounds almost mainstream.  Nothing incredible or horrible, just a solid contribution with a little clog dancing in the middle to break up monotony.<br /><br />INTERROGATION<br />I'm not quite sure of the purpose or thrust of this composition, but it just feels too busy.  It could very well be portions of three or four other songs from this soundtrack, but my ears are not talented enough to separate the noise variety.<br /><br />HANNA vs MARISSA<br />The best compliment I can give this song: When it plays I feel the need to run away, to escape.  It's tense, intimidating, and could be background music to any chase in any movie ever made.<br /><br />SPECIAL OPS<br />Crazy bass hits in an unnerving shotgun blast.  Probably never played on its own, the song is supposed to be unsettling during the movie.  Mission accomplished.<br /><br />ESCAPE WAVEFOLD<br />Played during Hanna's escape from a locked down compound, this is the funkiest song of the entire album.  Sirens and alarms are followed by a really catchy beat.  George Clinton could sing over the top o this and it would fit like a glove.<br /><br />CONTAINER PARK<br />If one song encompasses the desperate, bloodthirsty, frenetic pace of the movie Hanna, it's Container Park.  All of the highs and lows are in the correct locations to maximize emotional ties, and the overall sound is just plain eerie.<br /><br />Hanna may just miss the heart, but the Chemical Brothers have hit the target with deadly accuracy.n with a little clog dancing in the middle to break up monotony.

B004VBAHG6|4.0|My first thought on hearing this... man, what took so long??  This should've been the album to follow Cascade, which came out in 1995.<br /><br />In the years since Cascade, we've gotten an interesting but far from great EP with KMFDM; an unlistenable attempt at going all Dead Can Dance; an interesting but far from good live acoustic-reinterpretions album; tours and collaborations with Turd Reznick; and 1 album of leftover songs that was so middling I thought it was a b-sides collection.<br /><br />So, finally, 16 years after his last good album it sounds like Murphy has some new blood in his veins.  The songs here are very strong and energetic. It's great to hear him in fine form vocally and energy-wise. It does lack some of the subtlety of his earlier work.  The two slower ballad-type songs here he over-emotes a bit, as if he set his voice on 10 and never let up.<br /><br />The music really does sound like it's a proper follow-up to Cascade.  It's got thicker, chugging guitars, not much keyboards, most of it rocks in a very late-'90s way.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I'm not sure this will garner him any new fans. Old fans, however, should be very pleased by this. Pete is very much on top of his game and sounds renewed.
1588167461|5.0|Yes the pics are B&W.  But what is way more important is the advice is correct and very adept.  And it goes MUCH deeper that other books (lookin at you Details) that only scratch the surface with window dressing.  This one takes you into garment terms and history when relevant and the evolution of style.  It also gives advice consistent with the pictures - something you cant say about the Details book which contradicts itself while using pictures recycled from the magazine.      If you are not clueless and looking for a good guide book that will expand your knowledge base that much more while being an interesting read look no further.
B004ZEWP28|5.0|Just brilliant! All of the various styles Moby has delved into have merged together in this beautiful piece of work - This is his most self-defining album yet. I previously thought that 'Play' would be the most remembered Moby Album, but now I have to think twice!!
B0019OP0GU|5.0|I bought it for my daughter who had read the book. She enjoyed it and it is one of her favorite. I use to buy movies based on books my family has read, specially my daughter. She considers that the movie, in general, is close to the book.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|This is a good somewhat off-beat movie but you have to pay attention to follow the twists and turns.  Matt Damon plays Mark Whitacre, an employee of a major company that is engaging in price fixing.  He turns informant and works with the FBI for over two years to collect the conspirators on tape.  As it turns out, Whitacre has issues of his own, which complicates matters.  His character and motivations are questioned and the viewer is held in some suspense about the purity of his intentions.  It is difficult to give a detailed review without giving away the surprise parts of the story, which is in fact based on actual events.    The soundtrack, written by Marvin Hamlisch, provides a spoof like sense to the drama, as the almost cartoonish track follows Whitacre's doings.  In addition, we are often privy to Whitacre's thoughts in the middle of scenes with someone else.  These two elements make the movie somewhat discordant, and I can see how some viewers could be put off by it.  Also, Whitacre's wife is played like a stereotype of the stand-by-your-man wife, which makes the role seem unreal.  The FBI agents were at times also too artificial, as were some of the other bit players, especially the ones who played lawyers.    I think overall the film was a credible attempt to portray a complicated person in the midst of a crisis with various dimensions.  The saving grace for the movie is Matt Damon, who apparently put on some weight for the role, and who made Whitacre very real.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I have a sick animal, so this book hit a little close to home. That being said, I read it in two days because I adored Enzo. Both deep and simple, I like the use of racing as a metaphor for life (and I'm not a fan of racing). I thought it was entertaining and worth the tears.
0307266303|4.0|A pretty good read and something I'll read again in a few months so that it can sink in better.  My only problem is that it took until Chapter 27 to really get my attention as that is when the science of running came into play quite heavily.  A definite buy in my book.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|this game, first off is really fun and addicting. but there is one issue that really bothers me. I don't know if its the model phone I have (evo 4g) or the game itself. whenever I play it and I pause it answer a phone call I hold the home button to go into the &quot;recently used&quot; apps and when I open the game it starts all over again which happens all the time.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|District 9 is a surprisingly awesome science fiction/adventure type movie focusing around alien invasions, violent annihilations, communication with alien creatures and of course, saving planet earth.    What makes District 9 distinctly different from most alien films is that it focuses around getting to know the aliens by way of one British man (the main character of the film) getting to win over the admiration of the aliens, gradually, through lots of intense shooting and violence as soon as he realizes how unfair they've been treated.      When a spaceship suddenly appears in the skies of Johannesburg one day, alien creatures then invade the entire city.  The people of Johannesburg desperately try to contain the aliens by using holding centers for the tame ones, and lots of heavy artillery for the more aggressive aliens, but of course, the aliens are reluctant to do what the people want, and of course, the aliens are there in the first place because they're on a mission.  Hey, you didn't really think the aliens would arrive on earth because they wanted to take a vacation did you?  A happy place to go just to get away from all the hectic everyday universe activity?  Yeah, haha.    Anyway, it was a VERY pleasant twist to give viewers an alien movie where they communicate amongst themselves and with the people of earth.  I'm talking lengthy, detailed segments devoted to actual conversations- not just snippets here and there.  A very nice change of pace from the typical alien movies we normally see.    Furthermore, the storytelling was never exaggerated to the point of total confusion.  It's easy to grasp the concept because the writing was never once hard to comprehend.      Overall, the only negative is that the first 10 minutes are devoted to fictional interviews with people in a lame attempt to try and explain the alien invasions (making it very cheesy and ineffective as far as creating a moving atmosphere is concerned) but other than a slow and somewhat irrelevant start, I was mightily impressed with the quality of the writing, the presentation, the acting and how easy it was to understand the events taking place.  A great movie.  It reminds me of War of the Worlds to an extent (another movie I greatly admire).
0061714372|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down.     You see, I grew up a Megadeth fan only to lose track of them along the way. Their first 5 records were albums that shaped my high school and college years, but I fell off the bus sometime around the \\"Crush 'em\\" era. Those first 5 records defined a genre! And, as a fan, nobody likes to see interchangeable parts within their favorite \\"band.\\" You draw close to the guys that make up the band, not just the guy up front. I dug into \\"So Far, So Good...\\" thinking maybe Megadeth finally solidified the lineup. Then was duped again thinking, ok, finally, the \\"Rust In Peace\\" lineup IS Megadeth. I was trying to hang in there and cling to this band. But, for all intents and purposes, it was some 8 or 10 band members later that I realized, this isn't a band! Megadeth is Mustaine, and should have just been called Mustaine from \\"Killing is my Business..\\" on. What ticks me off further is that Mustaine alludes to all the pent up anger and animosity towards Metallica's business decision to dismiss him from the band, yet he acknowledges what makes bands stay together: camaraderie and PARTNERSHIP! He cites the longevity of U2; I'll add Pearl Jam and the Foo Fighters to the list of bands that form a partnership, share publishing royalties (even disproportionately), and become a band. How could Dave Ellefson dedicate 25 years of his life to a band and not become a partner? I've seen lawyers give 1/5 of the sweat equity at national firms and earn partner status. For as candid of a journey as this book is, I got exponentially more ticked with Mustaine's bullheaded-ness..      Regardless, the book was great. It was well written, a fascinating read, and for some reason, after seeing Megadeth (ahem, Mustaine) over the last 5 years, I've grown very fond of them again. I just saw the \\"Big 4\\" in Indio, and Dave just seems to be grateful, content, and smug in a \\"this-band-kicks-a..' way. \\"Endgame\\" is a great record and I'm proud to be a fan again. Thebook details in depth Dave's upbringing and drug problems, to the point where you just can't fathom him riding the same rollercoaster over and over. His deep rooted Metallica-angst is thorough, the inner-band squabbling is revealing, and the personal life of Dave's high and low points with his family is candid to be sure.     Finally, Dave's ultimate (seemingly) happiness is attributed to finding god and resolving conflicts with former band members, friends, and his wife. So as tragic as this could have turned out, I found myself even more thrilled to be a Mustaine fan.. and to know that he's healthy and alive. I'm proud of the guy, and frankly, when I dug up the \\"No Life Til Leather\\" EP on You Tube, it is very obvious that Dave helped shape the genesis of Metallica, and a genre as well. As Metallica gets sloppier (Lars is unbearable these days), Megadeth gets tighter.     Now, if he could welcome Junior as a parter, give the current guys a vested interest, then \\"Mustaine\\" becomes \\"Megadeth\\".. and we embrace Megadeth with Peace Sells-like fervor for years to come.
B004R96U4A|4.0|I read this book when it first came out and enjoyed it very much.  But I just got around to reading the Baroque Cycle books, and they are about ancestors of some of the characters, so I think it would be more enjoyable to read the Cycle first.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|this app is great but I updated it like it said it needed to be and all my notes dissapeared! the new version does not save your old notes. on my xoom, the notes were backed up on my internal memory but the only way to open the backups is threw the old app, which is now gone because of the update!  im still workin on how to reopen my old notes.  Do not update this app if you have something important saved, as I did!
B004QSQML8|5.0|LEGEND is not a great film nor a great piece of storytelling, but as an exercise in fantasy filmmaking, it is a distinct, entertaining, sumptuous visual experience. Ridley Scott didn't have the nerve to fight for his original version, which meant Universal and Sid Sheinberg -- the same combination that very nearly trashed Terry Gilliam's BRAZIL several months prior -- lead the parade to have the film recut and rescored. The decision was a disaster, eliminating huge sections of the story that made it incoherent, and removing Jerry Goldsmith's glorious, timeless score (one of his finest) in lieu of a Tangerine Dream score they hoped would appeal to teenagers and push the sales of soundtrack albums. Neither ended up materializing, and for years fans hoping to see what Scott intended all along were left with the bastardized 89 minute US theatrical release version.    Finally in 2002 Scott and his staff uncovered the last remaining copy of the 113 min. version he preferred over all other variants, and between the extra footage and the return of Goldsmith's soundtrack, LEGEND finally showed what it was meant to be all along: a beautifully, brilliantly designed fairy tale fantasy with a story that's never as developed as it could've been, yet from a strict visual standpoint, works. There's something undeniably captivating about the picture's look, its art direction and cinematography -- all \\"handmade,\\" before the days of CGI -- that keeps me coming back to the film in spite of its shortcomings.    Now that Universal has released the film on Blu-Ray, LEGEND goes one step further to validating itself in Scott's filmography. Details, colors, everything in Alex Thomson's original cinematography has been enhanced by a spectacular HD transfer. Never mind that the Director's Cut (really Scott's original, preferred version) comes from an \\"answer print,\\" the transfer is amazing to behold and anyone with an HDTV who enjoys this film will see an immediate upgrade in terms of visuals.Yes, Universal included the US theatrical version here too, but for most viewers it's a relic of the 1980s -- a senseless bastardization of Scott's original vision for the MTV generation. For those nostalgic for that version, it's here for them to indulge in, yet the greater work of cinema is undeniably the print that Ridley intended in the first place, now spectacularly presented in a Blu-Ray release that's a must-have for fantasy film lovers.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is a fun movie.  My family loved it.  It's based on the old A Christmas Carol from many years ago starring Charles Dickens. I would recommend this movie to any age group. If you like Christmas movies and like to have a good laugh and enjoy a good heart feeling, then this is the movie to see!
B004SBQAL0|4.0|I say this is an OK movie because it isn't until the last 30 minutes of the movie that the action picks up.  Other than that it might as well be called Smallville Anonymous.
B002ZG9846|5.0|She steals the show, but the guy does a great job definitely.  Fun movie and a lot of action.  Banana Splits music scene was cool for all you oldies who remember that show back in the early 70's.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a fantastic port of the PC version...if you liked that one, you will love this. It's a resource management game where you put down various plants to fend off waves of zombies. The graphics are great, sounds are spot on...they didn't include the zen garden, and some of the bonus games have been modified for the phone port, but I'm truly impressed by all the content they did include. Plays perfectly on my Droid 2, lots of gameplay to keep you busy.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Works great and has a great movie on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 along with great advertisements.
B002ZG980U|5.0|I had to watch this movie twice before I  understood it.  I really enjoyed it...the acting is great and it is a wonderful thriller.  Just be prepared to pay attention.  No getting up for a drink or trip to the bathroom.  You need to stay focused...or watch it over again.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that play with your mind.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Until today, I have never heard of this movie before I borrowed it from the local library.  It is by far one of the best sci-fi fantasy movie in a while.  A lot better than the battle for LA or Skyline.  If you like Aliens, Predator or Medeval fantasy movie, you have to watch this.
0425220931|5.0|I've been a guitar player since I was in the 5th grade.     About a year ago, I was traveling overseas and staying at friend's house. He's a musician and had this book laying out. It was given to him by a musician friend of his. Out of curiosity, I picked it up and flipped it open to a random page and started reading. It just so happened that the passage I was reading coincided with other things I was learning about at that time regarding numerology, sacred geometry, etc. I was blown away by what the book said and by the timing of it in my life.     After that I started reading the book from the beginning over the next 2 weeks and was continually rocked to the very core of my being over and over again. Sometimes I had to stop reading it for a day just so I could process some revelation I had learned from it. There was at least a couple times where I had tears in my eyes from the emotional impact of being touched very deeply and/or feeling like there was an affirmation of things that I have always known but could never put in to words or conceptualize.    At the time of reading the book I was playing in a band every weekend. This book changed the way I played literally overnight. It freed me up to play closer to how I've always wanted to play, which is partly about not being too hung up on music theory and/or playing the \\"right notes\\", although it's way more than just that.. I don't know how such a relatively young guy such as Victor got all the information in this book - it's stuff you'd expect from an old sage or Tibetan monk or something.    This is a book I will need to re-read throughout my life. This is a book you will buy copies of just to give to your musician friends. I get goose bumps just thinking about all the wonderful things contained in The Music Lesson. My heartfelt thanks to Victor for writing it..
B004J713JW|5.0|So glad I picked this one up. Not a huge Billy Joel fan but once I started watching this so many memorable songs came alive again. So great to see someone who wrote his lyrics and can actually play an instrument. This man has paid his dues, made mistakes and is more then happy to keep his nose to the grindstone. Hope to see him live someday because of this...
B001UQ71QY|4.0|The illustrations in the Kindle version are so low in resolution that they're not really worth looking at. You can't enlarge them at all. They don't even look okay at the standard size on my iPhone.<br />However, I do love WhisperSync. Being able to pick my iPhone up and start up where I left off the evening before on my iPad is genius!
0316056863|5.0|I have to admit to a bit of a crush on Ms Fey going back to her Weekend Update days.  She is a talented and funny entertainer and writer for the screen and her talent is on display here.  You learn of her life and her loves, but not too much gossip and back-stabbing.  She loves everyone and most of the people she's worked with are fantastic individuals.<br /><br />Fey memoirs about growing up in Philadelphia to moving to Chicago and becoming a cast member of the famed Second City improv troupe and her rise to fame on SNL and then 30 Rock.  Through it all she is still humble - to a fault.  She is a shining star, yet she relies on self-deprecation too much for her humor.  She comes across as a regular person uneasy with her own fame, and aware of the fickle nature of celebrity in America.  She knowingly ends her book talking about her own prospects for the last 5 minutes of her proverbial 15 minutes of fame.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book, even though I am not fully in her target audience (Fey aims her book more towards an imagined female readership).  The only real fault is that it was too short and over too quickly.  Also she only mentions Mean Girls in passing.  I would love to have heard her dish about Mean Girls.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i don't get why popcap decided to release the game in this state? why not take the time and make a proper port, one that works in all devices and that don' need 100mb to run? game is great, unfortunately android  port was an afterthought. popcap needs to rethink its priorities. android is a better ecosystem than iOS as of now on.
B004XIQIPQ|5.0|This album marks the newest transition of the Arctic Monkeys.  Away goes the psychedelic influenced \\"Humbug\\" to the soothing, mellow \\"Suck it and See.\\"  I highly recommend that anyone who is turned off by this album at first to listen to it several times before making a decision.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This series is amazing. I was intrigued by the other reviews and I am so glad I followed through and purchased this book. Its like Lord of the Flies meets 1984. Do not listen to anyone comparing this book to Twilight (unless you count the fact that the main character is romantically confused, but that is also featured in hundreds of other stories).
B003L77G6A|5.0|This is by far the best season yet. I love the character Amy so much.. she makes the show a million times better. The chemistry between all the characters is amazing & u wont regret watching the 4th season!

B004VUP8WK|3.0|Ok, it is clear the Morbid Angel of old is done. I sense this band is going to be like Metallica where nothing they release from this point forward will ever be universally loved. With that said, remember, these guys are in their mid to late 40's. How much more evil brutality do they have left in them? The new morbid Angel is a new beginning and a good to great modern extreme metal record. I think the weakest link is David Vincent. He seems to be phoning in his performance. the production saves it. He has brought back with him the industrial feel of his other band and that is what really changed the Morbid Angel sound. I question using the Morbid Angel name for the record as Trey seems to be holding back. The crazy guitar acrobatics are subdued. The layers of chaos have been streamlined for commercial sales? Pete's drums are missing (and replaced by what sounds like a drum machine on many songs). \\"Blades of Baal\\" is about as close to classic Morbid Angel as you will get on this and even then, Davids vocals are lazy. Yet the songs kills. The whole album kills but it is not Morbid Angel in the classic sense. \\"Destructos\\" sounds like a Drowning Pool song. \\"Radukult\\" is a Rob Zombie or Manson song. Lots of groove and I like it. Then the final song which sounds exactly like a battalion of tanks climbing a hill and then leveling everything in their way, ending with the aftermath of death and destruction. Illud Divinum is not an easy album to digest. Especially in this day and age of limited attention spans. The record requires repeated listens but will reward the listener eventually. I just wish it was not so much work to enjoy it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Will it ever be available for original droid? It's a shame to be left out. One can only hope so.

1440503257|4.0|This is a decent cookbook and has something for foodies and advanced cooks as well as beginners.  I haven't found any recipe to be difficult or had anything turn out too badly.  There are a lot of creative recipes creating treats from the HP series but a lot of pretty basic British comfort food as well.  While I'm not sure you need a recipe for cottage pie, I'll gladly take one.  There are no pictures, but a lot of the heavy comfort food I understand is not exactly photogenic.  Also this is pretty meat and potatoes focused and full of sweets - good and bad depending on who you ask.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This album is perfect and just what I had hoped for.  The album flows from one song to the other.  I have a feeling I will be listening to this album for a long time.  You will not be dissapointed at all.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|It's really sad when nearly every one of the deleted scenes on a DVD would have been an improvement on the film they were cut from. That's the way it is with X-Men: The Last Stand, the disappointingly anti-climactic final chapter in the X-Men trilogy.     The film itself waffles between cheesy and dark, largely because the thematically-heavy script by Zak Penn clashes with the fluffy sensibilities of hack director Brett Ratner (who was called in at the last minute to replace the original slated director Matthew Vaughn). Desperate to turn the film into a colorful action spectacle, Ratner denies most of the subplots any time to develop properly-- the film, despite being loaded with characters and concepts, clocks in at a lean 104 minutes (30 whole minutes shorter than X2). Most of the new characters, such as Angel and Juggernaut, add nothing whatsoever to the film, and characters from previous films are crudely dispatched without any dramatic impact (one central character is killed off-screen, and is forgotten five minutes later).    The DVD adds insult to injury. Both editions of the film (widescreen and special) are exactly the same disc: a bare-bones release with commentaries, trailers, and deleted scenes. The deleted scenes are painful to sit through-- not because they're bad (for the most part), but because they include scenes CRUCIAL to the story's development, and alternate scenes that would have greatly improved the movie.    For example, Wolverine is grossly mischaracterized in the theatrical cut of the film: during the scene where the X-Men prepare to fly off an fight Magneto, Logan gives a rousing speech to the X-Kids (Iceman, Kitty, and the virtually mute Colossus) about standing together and fighting for the values that (SPOILERS) Professor X and Cyclops gave their lives for (END SPOILERS). He essentially becomes the true-blue hero leader, and convinces a bunch of teenagers to go fight and possibly die for a higher set of ideals. THAT IS NOT, IN ANY WAY,HOW LOGAN WOULD BEHAVE. Logan is a loner, not a leader, and he's certainly not an idealist; he's only on the team so he can try to save Jean from herself, not to fight for the Professor's great cause. And there's no way in HELL that he would talk a group of rookie teenage superheroes into dying on the battlefield for that cause. That's where the alternate version of the scene comes in: in it, Logan says the teens AREN'T coming, and Iceman and Kitty try to convince him to let them fight. Logan, clearly aware that they're marching off to their deaths, scoffs at their childish notions of heroism, and only relents when he realizes that they need to work together to have any hope of winning at all. It's a MUCH stronger scene, backed by a much more mature understanding of the ethics of fighting over beliefs and featuring a portrayal of Logan that's totally in character. Yet it was cut and replaced with jingoistic tripe, either because the director wanted to turn Wolverine into Captain America, or because the original scene was deemed to challenging for the atrophied brains of the summer movie-going crowd.    It's not the only example of such changes. All three alternate endings (they're actually separate scenes that combine to form one, complete ending) are more effective than the theatrical version, leaving the characters in far more interesting places. 30-second chunks of narrative-- some that would explain HUGE plot holes on inconsistencies-- litter the deleted scene menu, and one gets the feeling that if you could just cut them back into the film, the quality would improve drastically. Unfortunately, it's not true. Thanks to Ratner's lackluster direction and lack of taste, what could have been the grand finale of a fantastic trilogy instead sputters to a meager and unimpressive halt. There are flashes of excellence here and there-- Kelsey Grammer's Beast is practically ripped from the comic pages, and the confrontation with Jean in act two is actually pretty awesome--but unless you have some pretty low standards or a high threshold for pain, I wouldn't recommend this movie.
096798467X|1.0|I really want to make a bread oven, but this book is not terribly helpful. Too much hippie stuff, and not enough practical step by step information. Also, what if you don't live in a clayish region, or you don't feel like digging a giant hole your garden and making a huge mess? There are better instructions online.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|This is a really great Goku figure. It has 3 pairs of hands (fist, open hand, and 'kamehameha' hands) plus one \\"instant transmission\\" right hand as well as two faces, one screaming and one serious. Unlike the Piccolo, Goku seems to have more \\"ratchet\\" joints which works better for posing. Only gripe I have with this figure is the head feels a little lose (maybe because of the hair), still poses great however.
0743496736|4.0|This is the second book of Jodi Picoult's that I have read. It is without a doubt an interesting, gripping, entertaining read -- it held my attention quite well; stronger than when I read MY SISTER'S KEEPER (in that book, it took me a few weeks to get through the first half).  That said, I don't strongly recommend this book, but I do moderately recommend it.    The primary thing I don't like about her writing is the way in which she ends nearly every scene with that particular dramatic tone -- which is a good technique, but she OVERUSES it to a point that I was compelled to get up, get a pencil, and cross off sentences.  I wanted to vomit in her face! (Ha ha.  Not quite.)  Actually, her overuse of this technique was more annoying to me in MY SISTER'S KEEPER.    When the book ended, I felt kind of... blah.  The last however-many-pages of the book were very gripping, but there was, to me, little resolution. I know that things need to end realistically, but the final scene should have been different.  One of the primary elements (subplots) did not end with an adequate feeling of resolution.    (...Not that anyone other than a literature professor or very successfully published author has a right to critique another's work.)    In summary, I will tell you that I doubt I will read another of Ms. Picoult's books.  The reality, however, is that I will end up, eventually, reading them all.  It won't be long before I'll starting reading THE PACT or THE GLANCE.  Not enough novels achieve the quality that hers do.
B002G01EPC|5.0|Great Piccolo figure. Comes with 3 sets of hands (open, fist, and curled fingers) as well as one \\"special beam cannon\\" hand. It has three heads (clenches teeth, serious, and one with his hat). He also comes with his cape and a folded arms piece. Great figure looks awesome next to the Goku of the same set.
0307592839|4.0|So...full disclosure.  I'm an Egan fan.  Invisible Circus.  Look at Me.  Wonderful books.  So when I bought Goon Squad, I was ready for pleasure.  What I got was something less than pleasure, though something greater than admiration, and the renewed conviction that a book written with breathtaking skill does not necessarily make for a satisfying reading experience.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I can see why she received the Pulitzer.  She went in new directions, created something fascinating and unusual, and she did it with consistent panache and grace.  But it seemed that too much time was spent on holding the structure together, and not nearly enough time creating characters I could care about.  With a few exceptions... Lulu, young Sasha...they were all pretty unpleasant at most stages of their lives.  I kept reading because I was impressed, not because I was engaged. Maybe this is the direction that literature is moving.  Maybe it's like 12-tone music, or outsider art, and I'm just \\"too conventional\\" to understand. Perhaps.  But I can accept and applaud an artist's need to push the boundaries of her medium. Why do the same thing over and over?  And from that perspective, the book is a smash. I just don't think it's too much to ask that, in the midst of all that cleverness, she could also introduce me to characters that would pull me through the book because I cared so much about them that I was willing to bounce all over time to follow them through to the end.
014241543X|5.0|I like books that are different. This book is different. It's a gripping story that is hard to put down. It's also an easy read.  I haven't quite finished it yet, although I have an inkling about how it will end. We shall see. If you liked Stephanie Meyer's \\"The Host\\" and its unique character points of view, you'll like this.  And that's all I'm going to say!     June 8, 2011: I totally called the ending. Absolutely a great read.

However, my wife does...and she then describes them to me in lurid detail, complete with sound effects and wildy waving arms. I have to admit, the books sound interesting and I would very much like to read them eventually. But, I now know them so well from the vivid descriptions by my wife, I am waiting to forget everything I have been told about them to truly enjoy them. But, from the rave reviews my wife gives them and my own opinion after hearing all about them, I have to give Hard Eight 5 stars.<br /><br />(My wife would have written a review but I doubt she can do the review justice without the aforementioned wildly raving arms and sound effects.)

B000063JZQ|3.0|It must certainly be a daunting task to adapt a Shakespearean play.  In this 1971 production, Roman Polanski chooses to show very explicitly many events that occur off-stage in the theatre, for instance Macbeth's  stabbing of the king and in the end his own beheading.    Was the intention simply to be more cinematographic or, given the movie was produced by Playboy, to shock the audience and stir up publicity?    In any case, 40 years later, these elements fall a bit flat as viewers are now regularly exposed to much more violence and nudity.  Compared to say `Titus', a more recent adaptation of a work by Shakespeare, this `Macbeth' appears almost mild.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have a Samsung Vibrant and the gameplay is excellent as usual.  There are some issues, however.  If the game is paused too long or nothing happens for a moment it lets the phone go to standbye.  This would only be slightly irritating if it didn't have to go through a loading screen to get back into the game, which brings us to the load time.  The loading takes to long and because of the afformentioned issue it happens constantly.  I've even had it go into standbye while loading, which just starts it over again.  All that being said, it's still the old PvZ you know and love with no issues while playing.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just as good as the PC version. Excellent sound and graphics. Finally, Popcap gets serious about Android. Bring on the Peggle and Bejeweled!
B004VUP8WK|1.0|this is a joke..right ?  the godfathers of death metal who are envied by their peers in Deicide and Immolation have sold-out Metallica-style and released the biggest heap of crap EVER. this band has always been inventive but they have gone too far this time. the change in musical style is so \\" radical \\" that it's embarassing and cringeworthy. Did UFO's fly into Florida and abduct the real Morbid Angel ?  or were they kidnapped by a radikult ?   either way..I wouldn't pay a dime for this musical feces or even waste my time illegaly downloading it. GO BUY THE NEW HATE ETERNAL..you won't regret it.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Eric Clapton is at a point in his career when he needs not please anyone but himself. In doing so, he shows us the heart of who he is and where his music comes from. We have everything from the old time blues sound of Rocking Chair to the modern, soft bluesy Diamonds Made From Rain. The vibe is relaxed, the sound effortless. This is Clapton stripped down and unworried. Drop you hard rocking and/or heavy blues expectations at the door, kick back and enjoy this one for what it is.

However, this device is also hooked up to my tv. I have a separate aux splitter/ (not an amplifier) that i sometimes use to hook up my laptop to this device, while it is hooked up to my tv. This allows me to hear my tv, while i can run programs like skype. One problem i have always had, through skype, was feedback( from my tv).   If you are considering buying this. Note that you will probably need an adapter for 1/4 to 1/8th aux.   In order to hook my tv up to this device, i used a male component cord from my tv to a female component cord that leads to a aux 1/8, and then i use an adapter (1/4-1/8) to connect everything.  There may be an easy solution to this method, however these were all cords available to me already.  Regardless, the sound quality is excellent and this device served my multiple needs. THUMBS UP
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Sometimes an album can get a 2-4 star rating if there are bad songs on it.  Here is an instance in which the album deserves zero stars, EVEN when there are a handful of good songs on it.  The reason is that the bad songs are so bad that they ruin the entire experience of the album.    Imagine watching an old classic movie like Citizen Kane, only somebody has spliced scenes of a Dane Cook stand-up special in the film every 15 minutes.  You still can't say \\"it was an okay film\\", instead you say \\"the whole thing was RUINED\\", regardless of the good scenes that you still got to watch.    I don't need to pick apart the songs; you all know which ones are good and which are bad.  My recommendation:  purchase those good tracks from Amazon (typically about $0.99 a piece) and pretend it's an EP.    And I have one word for the people who have given this five stars:  TROLL!
B002RKRGQ2|4.0|This is the first book by Wodehouse that I've ever read.  It is unbelievably funny -- at several points, I found myself laughing aloud while reading.  I can't wait to read more of his books.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of Kindle free books, I didn't notice many errors in the text.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|I was working in Paris in 2007 at the American Embassy, and when I was leaving work one day during the summer...I happened to bump into Liam Neeson, and paid him a compliment on \\"Batman Begins\\".  He was very nice, and actually struck up a short conversation.  I asked him what he was doing here, and he said that he was working on a movie called...yep--\\"Taken\\".<br />  I remembered that about seven months later, when this movie premiered in France (I don't believe that it reached the States until almost a year later).  In many ways, the story has been redone in many different forms--Mel Gibson's \\"Ransom\\" in the '90s; I even believe there was a George C. Scott variation in the late 1970s.<br />  Lack of originality does not go hand-in-hand with lack of entertainment, however.  If you combine Luc Beeson's knack for high-adrenaline action with Neeson, who is a LONG human being (IMDB lists him at 6'5\\"--I think they're a couple of inches SHORT) who certainly hasn't been afraid of taking big dramas (Schindler's List) or over-the-top action (Darkman, of course)...and the mix ends up pretty good.<br />  Neeson pretty much carries the film.  Love Maggie Grace as the daughter Neeson's Bryan Mills wishes to establish a relationship with, Famke Janssen--looking slightly older, but still a knockout--as the ex-wife who wishes the ex-husband would go away...until the daughter gets kidnapped in Paris; Xander Berkeley as the richer, more stable second husband who GETS OUT OF THE WAY when Neeson's Brian Mills goes on the warpath; Leland Orser and Jon Gries as coworkers in Mills' former life...<br />  But this is Neeson's film from the start, and he gives many sides to Bryan--the father who never forgets his daughter's birthday or misses an opportunity for her to pursue her chance to sing, the estranged ex-husband, the \\"preventer\\" when working in a bodyguard team for a singer (nice quick turn there, Holly Valance), the badgered male when the daughter wants to go to Paris--and the motherbrowbeats him into signing off on it...and last but not least, the ex-covert operations operative that goes medevial when his daughter is kidnapped by white slavers in Paris.  The movie's catch phrase--the whole line that Neeson delivers leading up to the \\"I will find you, and I will kill you\\" line is, in many ways, the early 21st century equivalent to Clint Eastwood's \\"Do you feel lucky?  Well, do you...PUNK??!?\\" speech from \\"Dirty Harry\\".<br />  Sure, the premise isn't original; and the characterizations are sort of staid.  But Neeson carries this movie, both with his emotional input and his physical presence.  Combine it with Beeson's take on action in movies...and we end up with a pretty good ninety minutes.  Highly recommended.
B0034DBRFC|5.0|This Belinda Carlisle album is one of her best (maybe the best) cd she recorded because every song is good and the DVD is good too.The song \\"Circle in the sand\\" is an outstanding song as well as \\"Heaven is a place on Earth\\".This album  is definitely a gem! The album is remastered with bonus tracks which is a plus.  If you like female rock with clear sounding music I would recommend this CD + DVD to you all.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is one of Woody Allen's enchanting forays into cinematic fantasy. While it isn't quite up to the fantasies Allen made in the 1980s (\\"Zelig,\\" \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\"), it merits a solid four-and-a-half stars, and I'm happy to kick in the extra half-star to give it the highest rating.<br /><br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" is the story of Gil (Owen Wilson), a Hollywood screenwriter dissatisfied with his career, visiting Paris with his snippy fiancee (Rachel McAdams) and her dreadful parents (Kurt Fuller, Mimi Kennedy). One night, wandering alone through the Rive Gauche, he sees an ancient Peugeot limousine; the passengers stop and invite him in. This is Gil's entry into the Paris of his dreams--the Paris of the Twenties, in which Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates), Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll), Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody), Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald (Alison Pill, Tom Hiddleston) and others cavort in a magical city of abundant promise and possibility. There is even more promise and possibility in the person of Adriana (Marion Cotillard), a beautiful fashion designer and artists' groupie with a passion for the Belle Epoque of Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec.<br /><br />Allen doesn't try to make \\"Midnight in Paris\\" anything more than an airy little souffle of a movie. But the film is far more optimistic than any that Allen has made recently, and he sustains its magical mood brilliantly. (He grabs us with the opening few minutes, a wordless mini-travelogue of Paris accompanied by a lovely, slow Dixieland blues.) Owen Wilson brings a joyous, puppy-dog eagerness to the lead role, and the rest of the cast is equally fine; Michael Sheen has some wonderful moments as the sort of pompous pseudo-intellectual Woody has been skewering at least since \\"Annie Hall.\\" \\"Midnight in Paris\\" has a pointed yet painless moral--that it's up to us to create our own Golden Age, right here and now--and envelops its viewers in a lingering, enchanted glow.
0439023483|2.0|This story is so contrived and so beyond belief. It seems as if it's just set up for sensationalism and violence. The plot could have been captivating for those interested in life in the future under a dictatorial government, but it was way over the top. I read all of it, but it was a chore and I couldn't wait for it to be over. I won't be reading this author's next book.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|As a long time fan of both Derek and Susan's individual bands, this album is a culmination of everything that I love about the two bands!  Could not recommend it more!  Something about it as well is that Susan REALLY seemed to nail every one of her tracks.  I can think of no other female vocalist in the world that does it for me like Susan Tedeschi!  WELL DONE!  As for Derek, he is on this record as he always is.  Tasteful and lyrical..his guitar is the perfect compliment to Susan's voice.  If you like either DTB or Susan Tedeschi, this is a must have record.  Buy it...you won't regret it.
B004Y03LQ2|5.0|Iron Maiden can do no wrong. I also think it's cool we get to listen to live versions, with Dickinson and the definitive band, of the songs originally sung by Blaze Bayley.   I'm surprised that so many so called fans complain about \\"best of albums.\\" These albums are not for the people who own all the groups albums. They are for the casual listener who wants a large verity in one package. I however do own all the CD's, but I will be buying this on Vinyl so I get to have the best of these past 20 years on my turn table. And that wicked cool album cover too!     \\"Up The Iron's\\"
B0017SWPXY|2.0|OH! Come on!!!<br /><br />This is just \\"Love Story\\" from a dog's point of view. Not dreadfully written...just trite and predictable!<br /><br />Who are all these folks who gave it high ratings and what are they reading...romances??? I want to avoid their material.
B004EPYZOY|3.0|Mainstream cinematic trash-fests aren't often as fun as Drive Angry, brought to us by the same crew behind the 3-D remake of My Bloody Valentine.  Nicolas Cage stars as Milton, a man who has come back from Hell to avenge the death of his daughter and save the life of her baby, who is set to be sacrificed by a Satanic cult leader (Billy Burke).  Along for the ride is a tough waitress (Amber Heard) and on their trail is the mysterious Accountant (William Fichtner), whose determined to bring Milton back where he belongs.  Though it's over the top and barely makes a lick of sense, Drive Angry succeeds thanks to the fact that the cast manages to perform so admirably that it's almost shocking.  Fichtner especially plays his role with such zeal and scene-chewing menace that his performance is worth the price of admission alone.  Well, that and the fact that Amber Heard is spectacular eye-candy, but I digress.  Though it begins to fall apart by it's final act, Drive Angry is enjoyable for the most part, as long as you leave your brain and sensibilities at the door.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|This series was suggested to me by my boss at work when talking of books for our kids and grandkids.  He said I would like it and I did.  The Alchemyst caught my attention nearly as soon as it started and held it all the way through.      I did find some of the \\"twin\\" action and story... well, irritating.  I know there has to be conflict and turmoil, but I absolutely hate the same old storyline of the \\"jealous\\" thoughts and actions of the one who isn't treated the same, or, because of circumstances, doesn't receive the same \\"powers\\" and goes off to pout.  If this one storyline wasn't there, I would have loved the story much more.  I know it's human nature, but please, does it have to be in every story I seem to read lately?      As to the enjoyment factor in this book... it is there and the book is hard to stop before the end is reached.  Of course I bought the rest of the series.  The grandkids will love it when grammy reads it to them the next time they visit.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|Never judge a book by it's cover. However, you can with this book. Lewis thoroughly examines a new art, or science, or theory to managing the game (read: economics) of baseball.    The book encompasses the decisions and semi-biographical view of Billy Beane; the eccentric general manage of the Oakland Athletics baseball team. The book by Lewis begins by examining the life of Beane, a successful up-and-coming major league baseball player who defies his look of being a \\"typical white guy\\" and more fits the mold of a \\"typical black guy\\" in the eyes of baseball scouts by having a great physique, speed, and strength behind his baseball bat. Unfortunately, Beane's professional MLB career is short lived and he finds himself at the helm of the Oakland A's. Due to his ill fortune in the major leagues, he doesn't surround himself with former MLB greats in the front office like most GMs do; he does the opposite. He selects intellectual Harvard/Yale grads who excel at mathematics and statisticians who believe the science and math behind baseball is flawed.    To fuel this new science, the A's owner is not a fan of baseball but uses baseball as business; this giving Beane a very slim budget to purchase players in comparison to his rival Anaheim Angels. By using Beane's new theory of paying low for players and scouting unheard of college kids, he is able to develop a low budget team with great success. His team for a few years wins 100+ games a season, and also wins 20 games in a row with a roster of unheard of players. However, he comes to realize even with his great regular season success, he is deemed a failure in the eyes of the fans, the organization, and MLB by not acquiring a pennant for the city of Oakland.    In summary, the book opens our eyes to what goes on in baseball not on the diamond, but in the offices under the diamond. The science and art-form of each GM differs greatly and differs between a thin boarder of success and failure. Lewis does a fantastic job summarizing Beane's feelings towards overpaid players and up and coming players who he can form and model like clay to his form of baseball.     The book also can be a feel-good book and self motivational tool by focusing on a few players Beane discovered who definitely do not define the typical mold of a MLB player, but defy all odds and become very good players.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow, what a RIDE!  It was scary, heart-wrenching and POWERFUL!<br /><br />What an imagination.  I felt the dispare of District 12 and could see the coal-black landscape.  I could feel the hunger of the population and their willingness to do anything to fill the \\"hollow days.\\"  I hated those in power and their bloodlust when being cruel seems to be their only reason for being.<br /><br />There is a powerful story between Katniss, Gale and Peeta.  Between the \\"best friends\\" and the \\"got-your-back-survivors\\" of the Games.  To have to participate in the terrible \\"reaping\\" year, after year, and feel what those families felt.  To be forced by those in power, to watch children kill.<br /><br />So depressing... and yet, there is a strange lightness, too.  Rhu brought it with her, and it stayed after she left.<br /><br />I will certainly get the rest of the series, because somehow, I have to KNOW, so I can sleep at night.
B004RQVVGU|1.0|This review pertains solely to the remastering and not the actual album material.      This is remastered incredibly loud with severe noise limiting to compensate for it.  Also, the treble is way too high, in an artificial sense, with some of Ozzy's lyrics having a \\"hiss\\" here and there at times and similar issues with other instruments.      Perfect for mp3's and ring tones!  Aweful for any even remotely decent home stereo.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|This book is outstanding. I have been bulimic in and out of recovery since I was 17 now 41.  Anybody who has every suffered from any Eating Disorder should read this.

1582701709|4.0|Right then.     Is it a load of old tosh or real life affirming stuff?     Well, I would fall into the latter decision but there are some reservations I have.   Firstly, this is a book that you take what you want from. You should read it and keep a note of the things that you think will benefit you in the long run.     Take that \\"putting a call out to the universe\\" talk. I don't think I want to walk into the office and tell all the girls at work that I'll be getting a mansion because I put a call (collect) out into the universe. Plus, a colleague might be tempted to call the men in the white coats to come and remove me.     However, some of the points that this book makes are really thought provoking such as worrying. How many hours of our precious, and short, little lives do we waste sitting around worrying. If we worry over trivial matters - then how are we helping ourselves? That is one small point I have taken from this book and fully intend to act upon. There is a lot more to be gained from this book, but as I said - you should take what is relevant to you.
0316056863|5.0|I purchased it for the shore and completed it four days in advance of my vacation. It's well written and very conversational. I  enjoyed reading between the lines and seeing the serious commentary Fey was attempting to convey through humor. If you're looking for something light, this is a great choice!
B0042816YK|3.0|I'm surprised at how many bad reviews this film is getting. Julia Roberts gives a great performance in what is a light hearted film about changing the course of your life. We're not being told to subscribe to the theory on display in the film, but simply to sit back, enjoy and consider some of the things being discussed.     Personally, I thought it was great, light entertainment that has a heart. I'm also ordering a copy of the book as I type:)     Very enjoyable.
B001AQT0OU|4.0|Warner Bros. needed to get this onto Bluray so they could release it as part of their latest Kubrick box set.  Of course Kubrick fans already owned all the previous BR releases so it is nice that this single disc of BARRY LYNDON is available seperately (as is LOLITA).  Warner seems to have done the absolute minimum to get this disc out.  All previous Kubrick BR releases have featured extensive restorations and tons of bonus materials.  This disc gets no bonus features whatsoever aside from a very tired looking trailer.  The packaging is cheap eco case quality typical of budget release titles and to be fair, Warner isn't charging much for this disc.  The picture quality is very good but not the revelation that THE SHINING or 2001 BR releases were.  It looks good and is far better than the previous DVD release with lots of print dirt and scratches being removed.  The new 5.1 soundtrack is okay but nothing really spectacular.  It's an older film shot with lots of soft focus so I guess I shouldn't expect much.  It is still a beautiful and highly entertaining film (I've always considered it one of Kubrick's very best) and I'm thrilled to get this much improved version.  Still, it would have been nice if Warner's had given this great film the same treatment the previous Kubrick releases got.  This one feels a bit lacking.  Worth getting for the improved picture quality alone, although sadly there is no option to watch the 4x3 version.  However, it is nice to see the theatrical aspect ratio after all the years of it being unavailable.  I just wish we had been given both versions.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Having never been a fan of David Fincher's work, I was knocked out by the quality of his visual story telling in this film.     Fincher uses some great nuances within his photography: how Eduardo is constantly seen 'outside' of the party, how Zuckerberg is obsessed with becoming 'part of the crowd' - an indicator of his character's desperately low self esteem.     My favourite scene in the film was where Zuckerberg receives the call from Parker towards the end, and the caretaker turns off the lights in the facebook offices. It's a great touch, Zuckerberg has cast aside his old reliable friend and now his new unreliable friend is also soon to be gone. No matter what he does, Zuckerberg is shown as being constantly alone - even when he is in a crowd.     I'm sure a lot of the film was made up, but there are some great messages within the script.     1. The problem between Zuckerberg and Eduardo is the fact that Zuckerberg has low self esteem and Eduardo does not. We see Zuckerberg constantly trying to gain approval from those around him, and even filling his house with sycophants in a bold attempt to make himself feel popular. Eduardo doesn't suffer from the same complexes and seems happy enough in his own skin, he never seems angry at being made to be the outsider - he doesn't need the approval of Parker or anyone else - he is content to be his own man.     2. The film isn't really about facebook, its about how you perceive yourself.     3. NEVER sign anything without having your lawyer read it!     4. Eduardo doesn't mind being Eduardo. Zuckerberg hates being Zuckerberg. Hence, Zuckerberg dislikes Eduardo and betrays him in a desperate attempt to make himself feel better.     It's a great story, a great movie, and ultimately a sad tale that relates to the real world.     Fantastic work from Fincher.
0393307050|2.0|I loved the movie. It was like they created the film just for me-- Napoleonic Wars, men in tallships, British naval uniforms... what more could a girl want? So I eagerly sought out the book. So very disappointing. Yeah, it was still Napoleonic Wars, men in tallships, and British naval uniforms, but....    It was a very difficult read. Could barely get through it. There were moments when it would be moving along nicely, and then the writing would just get heavy. Things would not be explained, as if the author, so very knowledgable of his subject, didn't realize his readers wouldn't have the same knowledge. And something about the writing kept reminding me of Austen's Pride and Prejudice [my least favorite Austen]. Not entirely sure why, but both have a lot of dialogue broken by narrative where things are sometimes glossed over, so that may be it. Interestingly, like Austen, O'Brian (apparently) wrote by hand.     In addition, the book has a competely different story to the film. Not that that is a problem, but it was a bit of a surprise (no pun intended).    I'm told the first two books in the series are difficult, so I will attempt another book and see if I like it better. Because I really want to like these books.
B004N66XYE|4.0|The Beeb have remade a great old favourite and pulled off the job with class.   The acting, production, and style are all top no.     I still catch the old upstairs downstairs on ITV3, and I was worried that the BBC might rush out a cheap imitation, but boy was I wrong!     Make sure you catch this gem of a show, it really does live up to the hype.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|When you see Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks together, you know you are guaranteed a one of a kind music experience.This husband-wife team are responsible for some of the finest roots music recorded today; Derek for his band and the Allman Brothers, Susan for her band and a collaboration with her husband, the \\"Soul Stew Revival\\". The Tedeschi Trucks Band, however, is the most ambitious project to date for this couple. It is also the most successful.    Derek long ago earned virtuoso jam band cred, as did Susan with her late fellow guitarist Sean Costello. This band, however, is about the SONGS. Derek and Susan had a hand in writing nearly all of the songs on this all original collection, with help from band members including Mike Mattison and Kofi Burbridge. While Derek's slide is unmistakable, Susan's guitar, Kofi's keyboards and the background vocalists get plenty of spotlight on each track.    The biggest surprise on this album, however, is the romantic vibe on so many songs. Those familiar with Billy Holiday and Lester Young can recall the tenor sax of The Prez enhancing the lovely voice of Lady Day on songs like \\"When You're Smiling\\" and \\"Back In Your Own Backyard\\". Likewise,the early years of Ike and Tina Turner reflected their mutual adoration in \\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\\" and \\"I Idolize You\\".Throughout \\"Revelator\\", Derek's slide enhances Susan's voice- never obtrusive, always supporting in a tasteful manner. In songs like \\"Come See About Me\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Slide\\", the emotion between these two artists is almost palpable.    Those looking for the superb playing these musicians are known for need not worry.Plenty of players are featured, especially on \\"Love Has Something To Say\\",the disc's strongest cut. Susan and Derek trade fours, the horns are prominent (Kebbi Williams-sax, Maurice Brown-trumpet, Saunders Sermons-trombone} and vocalists Mike Mattison and Mark Rivers get solo turns. It's also great to hear the Burbridge brothers working together. BassistOteil of the Allmans and keyboard player Kofi of Derek's band make up one solid rhythm section.    \\"Revelator\\" is the culmination of an eighteen month labor of love. This is a wonderful album, with the promise of more to come. Considering their youth, we probably haven't yet heard the best music from the Tedeschi Trucks band.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the same film, it has a great start and gets better.     But that's not all, there are so many great actors in this classic and they all work together so well. I doubt today's generation in Hollywood could sit together, let alone make a film together.     I wish Hollywood was still making films like this!
0756405890|5.0|My husband and I have read a LOT of books.  This series is a favorite.  Even though he's a new author, Patrick Rothfuss is on our \\"Favorite Authors\\" list.  This brief list also contains J.R.R. Tolkien, Orson Scott Card, Brent Weeks, Octavia Butler, and Raymond Feist.  Mr. Rothfuss's characters are incredibly believable and \\"fully formed.\\"  There's a flow to the writing that makes it quite enjoyable to read, and the world this author has created is just as real as any world created by other well-known Fantasy greats.  Mr. Rothfuss, keep on writing!  You have the natural talent.

B004G6009U|5.0|I cannot get enough from watching this beautiful movie. Blondie and Eugene make the journey out of a tower a big fun and eye-opening. I cannot wait for its UK release, therefore I decided to grab one immediately from the US even the price is steeper ^^ It was worth it, I'm sure.    The plots are touching at times plus numerous jokes that can keep audiences entertained in a very engaging way. It is worth as the 25th Animated film produced by Disney.    The film with inspiring story and fantastic graphics is considerably and increasingly rare, if you ask me.    Cheers,
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I love this disc but unfortunately I'm not nearly as articulate as others when it comes to describing its finer qualities.  I'm not particularly artsy and tend to enjoy my music rather than analysing it - I'm the type of person who can love a song and not have any clue what it's about!  While others will be able to dissect this disc song-by-song (very helpful to music aficionados) all I can tell you is that this disc is brilliant from start through finish.  I think she has a great voice but sometimes it sounds a little like she's shouting rather than singing but that's just her style.
B0000045C7|5.0|This version it is the most  frenzied one I have heard of any opera, and that frenzy  is not  out of place.The story calls  that Elektra be like that,she has lost her father Agammenon,and her traitorous  mother,who killed her husband,reigns supreme in the house, but after long disquisitions with herself, her sister Chrysothemis and her mother,she gets the help she needs from her returning brother Orestes,who kills their mother,after which Elektra dies,not without paying a last homage to her beloved killed father.This is a psychological studio,and the words of the libretto are matched by the music.And here we have what I believe are underrated singers,that have the drama in their blood. Anny Konetzni,Daniza Ilitsch and Martha Modl make this an opera to hear.Alas, it is not complete,and in some passages, the voices are lost,not the least because it is live,from the 1950 Florence Opera Festival,and the power of the orchestra  is tremendous in the baton of Maestro Mitropulos.But after hearing this, i believe no other version  reaches to the level of energy showed by these magnificient singing actresses,backed up by a wonderful conductor.It is a splendid version to hear.
1400079144|3.0|I loved the other two Robert Langdon books and so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, this book just could not live up to expectations.<br /><br />First of all I had a hard time getting into the story line. I grew up in a family full of Masons, Shriners, and I was even in Rainbow and Jobies two Masonic youth groups. So the plot line about ancient mysteries and a secret degree within the Masons was just too much of a stretch for me. I mean really? My Grandpa was Potentate of Washington State and my Dad is a Past Worshipful Master, and I'm a Past Honored Queen and Worthy Advisor. While these are all cool titles that sound mystical they are anything but. I just could not believe any of what was going on. And if you're wondering, yes it was hard for me to get through the book!<br /><br />I loved the other two books with all their religious undertones and wonderful art references but I felt like this one just did not try as hard. There were a few mentions of architecture but nothing that made me get online and look up a pictures like The Da Vinci Code had. It felt like I had seen all the places and references before and there was nothing to spark my interest. Maybe if it had been set in Europe I would have enjoyed the book more.<br /><br />Anyway, if you liked the other two books then you may like this one. It was not all horrible, there was a ton of action and really never a dull moment. It was just not my kind of book.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />I just need to get this out. The ending was total crap! Really, the lost symbol was the word/bible and it all connected to Katherine's research, I did not see that coming a mile away. Dan Brown, next time give me a storyline that makes me think and a ending that is not a total joke.
B004VUP8WK|5.0|Wow!! The new album blows me away. Trey's solos are in top form and the songwriting is unique even if its not all in the death metal genre! I really like the new style and am surprised that others have rated it lower?! Unexpected music and a great rebirth with vincent back in the front. Killer drumming and production value. My hat is off to tim yeung who has done a fabulous job temporarily replacing pete on drums. I am guessing that some people are disappointed because some of the material is not all death metal. It's a weird trip for sure but I think that it's more exciting and fun than Heretic for sure and can't wait to see this performed live. ALL HAIL MORBID ANGEL!!! ILLUD DIVINUM INSANUS RULES!!!
B002VBV1S6|5.0|A beautifully written tale that kept me reading into the early morning on numerous occasions. Not at all what I was expecting, but when it's this good, I couldn't care less. :)
B004TMPSL6|4.0|The themes contained in this rather short novel are extraordinary. That should be motive for reading through the entire book because one needs to get to the end in order to appreciate and understand the themes. It is a bit dry for a couple chapters in the middle of the book in my opinion, but it is not enough to seriously mar the book itself.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|Just imagine Old Whitney as the hare.  Everything that came outta her mouth was a hit and those notes she hit were at an all time high.  Old Whitney could do no wrong and her adoring fans were a testimony to that.  Now, here's New Whitney, the tortoise that recorded this disc, and while it has that feel good potential and was a very good comeback CD, it wasn't the megafire release that I was expecting.  In fact, for me, it was slow out of the gate and I had to play it several times in order to fit myself in it.  Whitney's voice is still there, it's just not the way that it was, and maybe that's for the best.  She may never get back to those days that have gone by, but with enough time, she can strengthen what has remained and start tailoring songs to her new vocal abilities and range, and with enough dedication, she can make it back again.  Her fans will remain with her, no doubt, but the hardcores that expected more....well, that may be another story altogether.

B003UESJF6|2.0|Cute graphics, but not even entertaining to a 12 year old. I just couldn't get though it either. Lacking any type of recognizable humor. Since humor is subjective, I'm sure that there is a select group that will find this absolutely hilarious, but not a group that you would want as neighbors.

B004LUHQ1G|4.0|My favourite description of the Foos (by a mate of mine) \\"...SHOUTY SHOUTY SHOUTY quiet quiet SHOUTY SHOUTY...\\". It's funny cos it's true.<br /><br />But this record is a bit less \\"quiet\\" and a bit more \\"SHOUTY\\". And much the better for it!<br /><br />The fear was that Wasting Light might just be another Foos-by-numbers album, but thinking about it how could it be?<br /><br />Grohl is back to his snarling best, Pat Smear is... well... back, Krist Novoselic makes a cameo, the record was recorded in Grohl's garage and to top it all it Butch Vig produced. That's a pant moisteningly exciting prospect if you had long hair in the early 90s (which probably needed a bit of wash). Grunge how grunge was meant to be done, and thank Buddha* Wasting Light more than lives up to it!<br /><br />From the rollicking shout'a'thon \\"Bridge Burning\\" (one of the best opening tracks to a rock album of recent memory), through the air-guitar & sing along choruses of \\"Dear Rosemary\\" & \\"These Days\\", to the obligatory (but no less awesome for it) lighters-in-the-air track \\"I Should Have Known\\"; the Foos are rocking it through every track!<br /><br />A massive return to form, Grohl et al, I doff my cap you!<br /><br />* I had to get one Nirvana reference in there didn't I?
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|When I found out that Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi were recording a blues album together I couldn't wait to hear it. Trucks is one of the best blues guitar players out there and Tedeschi has a beautiful voice with guitar talents of her own. From the opening chords of \\"Come See About Me\\" to the last notes of \\"Shelter\\", this is an amazing collection of tunes that has it all: blues, soul, rock, funk, and everything in between. Filled with blues-influenced rockers and soft, expressive ballads that show off Tedeschi's huge vocal range, plus a series of incredible solos featuring Trucks's outstanding slide-guitar, Revelator also introduces the new, 11-piece ensemble - Tedeschi Trucks Band. And they do not disappoint. \\"Bound for Glory\\" and \\"Learn How to Love\\" are high energy blues-infested rockers that will leave you with your mouth hanging open. \\"Midnight in Harlem\\"  changes the mood with meaningful, introspective lyrics and soulful music. \\"These Walls\\" is a beautiful song with an uplifting message of day to day survival in our current harsh times. \\"Simple Things\\" marvels in the unasked  joys of life that Tedeschi delivers with passion. The band is tight, the production is crisp and fresh and the songs knock you off your feet. I would recommend this to anyone!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These are excellent for playing next to a sleeping wife. The x41's come with an optical cable that plugs right in to the spdif jack on the back of my 360 slim. I was worried at first that the 360s might cut the audio out of the hdmi cable if the spdif was plugged in, but not so! The 360s outputs audio over hdmi and spdif simultaneously, so you can use either or both. When I use the headphones, I just turn them on and mute the surround sound. And no flak from the wife for forgetting to put things back for when she watches TV.    I have had zero interference issues, despite my xbox operating off of wifi a floor away, 2.4ghz landline phones, a plasma tv and cell phone all within very close proximity of the x41 base.    The headphones are light, very comfortable, and the cans fit completely over my [somewhat large] ears. The boom shaft is the perfect compromise between firm and flex, and easily swings up out of the way or even detaches.    There is crackling when you plug in and even rotate the chat cable to the 360 controller, but it doesn't happen with normal movement, only when getting settled.    Crackling is also present as the batteries are in their last throws.  It's not as bad as I've read some reviewers complain about, but I would have preferred a more graceful handling of the low-battery situation.  I expect they would fix this on the next version.    I can still easily hear room sounds with the headphones on and at a moderate volume. The material is like cloth, very airy. Good ventilation for preventing ear sweat too.  (Yes, you can crank them up and drown everything else out if you want).  I was able to carry on a normal conversation with my wife while playing with the headphones turned up to what I consider an adequate volume (enough to take full advantage of the surround sound).      Which brings me to the other thing worth mentioning: the positional audio! Super fantastic. I totally know where that guy was standing when he blasted me with the rocket launcher. Seriously, it does improve your game. I'm still trying to get used to it and let myself trust it!  Now, I prefer to wear these headphones whenever I play - not just for xbl chatting  or trying to not wake family members.    I imagine, though, that the positional audio might be better on higher-end headsets. With the x41's, there's about a \\"2-hour\\" zone (i.e. the guy is at about 7-9 o'clock behind me). Not exactly pin-point, but still really great for the price.  I've heard great things about the a40's and the Mixamp, but couldn't justify that much $$.    Also note: these are supposedly 7.1. There are other xbox headphones out there touting 7.1 as well. The xbox 360 does not support anything higher than 5.1. In addition, the sound card in the 360 is pretty low-end to begin with.   Perhaps fancier headphones do an adequate job of upmixing to an effective 7.1, I don't know for sure.  I'm just saying; Do your homework before overspending for features that exceed the 360's limitations.
0307887960|2.0|I saw a review of this diet on the Dr. Oz show and thought I would give it a try.  It doesn't sound so bad--all you can eat lean protein and non-fat dairy.  But, all of that lean protein must be cooked with no oil or butter.  Eating a steak or shrimp, or anything cooked without these two ingredients makes for a very flat meal.  It doesn't seem super restrictive but 3 days on the attack phase of this diet and I was ready to go out of my mind.  It is a healthier alternative to Atkins but in the end cutting out so many things from your diet makes it difficult and depressing to follow for very long.  Save your money and try Weight Watchers online.  At least you can eat carbs and have a glass of wine while still losing weight.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I've always been upset at how expensive Apple's iPhone accessories are. I recently had to get a new iPhone case for my iPhone 4 and fortunately found this one. It's a nice alternative. The case is made of smooth rubber which provides a firm grip. My only criticism is that it's a bit of a struggle to actually put it on the phone, but you just have to get the right angle.     Overall, the Apple iPhone cases are probably better in that they're easier to put on and the back has hard plastic protection, which probably protects the phone better in case it falls. However, for the price, this Amazon version is probably good enough and will save you a good deal of money.

B0036TGSR6|5.0|With the multitude of films on the market, it is hard to find a film with a new plot. This one has superb understated and therefore very effective acting by each actor, the suspense is built beautifully and is palpable, and the ending has a new twist and then a new turn. It is one of the best films. It is advertised as \\"one of Roman Polanski's best. An Addictive thriller.\\" This is true, not hyperbole.<br /><br /> Ewan McGregor is hired to ghost write the autobiography of the ex-prime minister of England, Pierce Brosnan. The previously assigned ghost writer was found dead under mysterious circumstances. Did he jump from a ship as a suicide? Was it an accident? Was it murder? McGregor discovers that the draft written by Brosnan is terrible, filled with boring material, a good cure for insomnia. He interviews Brosnan who tells him as true facts events he finds out are not true. Is he lying or just forgetful? Brosnan is being charged with war crimes, with torture of terrorists, with unnecessary English deaths. He is shown to be involved with Americans who take a very hard even brutal approach to terrorists. What is going on? Is he a villain or is he being used by others?
B0001CCY7E|5.0|I love the music, which was my primary purpose for ordering it.  The CD was new and the sound quality is good.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|A very long winded story about a woman that denies her powers, falls in love with a vampire, eats...a lot, sleeps... a lot, and drinks a lot of wine and herbal tea.  The author goes so far as to describe each 4 course meal these people share...it is very annoying.  Not to mention the fact that the author assumes everyone on the earth knows what the Bodlean library at Oxford looks like, and that everyone on earth has an understanding of Alchemy.<br /><br />The story seems to end in the middle...on the brink of some kind of war between vampires, witches, daemons... and possibly humans, and the main characters \\"time travel\\" to some point in the past...and that's it!  The book leaves you exhausted, at best, and completely mystified.<br /><br />I hope the author does not write a sequel until she can stop describing about every single meal, drink, and nap that the characters take. Until that time, I would not recommend reading this book, especially at the $14.95 Kindle price (way overpriced, Amazon!)

There is clearly a manufacturing defect with the recording process for this CD.    The 2nd disc has some great music, but this batch should be reinpected before another customer gets defective merchandise.    As always, Amazon handled the return of the first order with speed, security, and accuracy.  I will continue to shop with them.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|So I purchased this with the thought that more cooling is better.  I've been in the computer industry for years, and I used to build my own systems routinely.  It used to be that a aftermarket cooling unit was required.  Not only is that no longer the situation, but you may be doing yourself a dis-service, depending on your needs.      Here are my tips... First, don't even consider purchasing this if you are not overclocking -- just buy a boxed processor.  Second, consider that while the design is optimal for heat transfer it is NOT an intuitive install.  Third, size can be an issue -- my mistake here -- it did not fit in my case.  Finally, I was concerned about my ability to properly balance it on my processor (without damage).  I ended up returning the unit.    All that said this appears to be a good product for non-liquid cooling.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|Naturally, once I got my hands on my new Verizon iPhone 4, one of my top priorities was to protect it. It's not a cheap item and I intend to keep it in good shape so I can sell it to buy a 5 when it's available. I searched online for hours, literally hours, looking for the perfect case. I read reviews on iPhone sites, in magazines, on Amazon, everywhere. Finally I settled on the [[ASIN:B004JZEJPY Case-Mate Pop! Case]]. I like it a lot, and I can recommend it for its slim profile, its sturdiness, and its rubbery side grips.... but it hides the beauty of the iPhone. And the iPhone really is such a lovely piece of machinery. So I was very happily surprised when I got the AmazonBasics case. It's not quite as burly as the Case-Mate, but it's a lot sleeker. It protects most all of the case from scratches, and that's primarily what I want a case for. See my photos in the Customer Photos section above for four shots of what the case looks like on my Verizon iPhone 4; you'll see that there are a few areas left exposed, but overall it's sleek, tight, and protective. I like the fact that it's got a lip around the front; it protects the phone when it's face-down and it keeps the screen protection film from being dislodged at the edges.The Case-Mate, and some other cases, enclose the volume buttons and the on/off button, but the AmazonBasics case leaves them naked. It's perfectly fine, but probably not the best if you're working in filthy environments or you really want maximal protection. On the other hand, the AmazonBasics case, while offering less protection, does stay closer to the natural feel of the iPhone; there's the tradeoff.<br /><br />I didn't try the screen protector, because I had already installed a [[ASIN:B003RWQC9G Pro Guard Film]] beforehand. I like the Pro Guard, but dang, 15 bucks for protective film is a lot. I may have been better off just waiting for this one; it looks high-quality, and comes with a little cleaning cloth and smoothing card. If my Pro Guard film comes to a bad end, I'll install the Amazon Basics film and update this review.<br /><br />One comment -- the design on the back has concentric circles around the Apple logo on the back of the iPhone. It looks okay, I guess, but kind of has the effect of screaming, \\"LOOKY HERE! A real, authentic iPHONE! With the Apple logo and everything! YAY ME for having an iPhone!\\" It's a bit overstated for my taste; I would have preferred a plain, clean back.<br /><br />Overall, it feels good in the hand, pleasantly rubbery/vinyl-y, it has a little bit of traction so it doesn't slip out of your hand, but not so much that it resists going in and out of your pocket, and it lets most of the beauty of your phone shine through. And it's a truly excellent deal for the price. My advice is: If you're looking for a low-key, slim and sleek case to protect your iPhone from scratches and light dings, try this one first before you agonize for hours over picking one and end up spending 45 bucks. It's a very small gamble and I think you'll be quite pleased.<br /><br />UPDATE, 10 days later...<br /><br />Inevitably, I dropped my brand new iPhone. Twice. Once on a tile floor and once on a concrete pathway. I didn't expect much protection from this case (my plan was just not to drop the phone -- this is called \\"denial\\"). Fortunately, I have to say the case cushioned the blow both times. My iPhone landed on a corner on the concrete, and then fell face-down, and neither the case nor the phone were damaged. I've officially retired the costlier Case-Mate cover I bought earlier. Even the concentric circles on the back of the AmazonBasics case are starting to grow on me, a little. Highly recommended.to a bad end, I'll install the Amazon Basics film and update this review.

1594744769|5.0|Wow! Goodnight Twilight. Nap time at Hogwarts.  This first novel by Ransom Riggs masterfully combines a variety of elements, all of which work together to create a thoroughly compelling story with so many intriguing levels that it becomes more exciting each time it's read (yup, it's one of those rare books that you don't want to put down on the first go, and then want to read again).  The story of Jacob, a sixteen year old trying to find himself by tracking down the secrets of his grandfathers past, provides a suspenseful narrative with more twists than a mountain road, none of them predictable, and yet all of them believable.  It's a mystery.  It's an adventure.  It's a thriller.  It smoothly weaves together realistic, emotionally gripping personal, family, and even historic material along with a clever fantasy world; what's truly remarkable about the tapestry Riggs creates is that these multiple levels are all exciting on their own and yet each level underscores and heightens the energy and insight provided by the others. And of course, it's a coming of age tale as well. The characters, even minor ones, are drawn vividly--both in the world of the real and the fantastic. The major characters are created with depth, in particular Jacob, who carries around--from the start--the sort of emotional weight that anyone who has been an adolescent or teenager (right, all of us) can understand.    This would be an exceptional book even without the strange, luminous, evocative photos around which the characters and narrative have been seamlessly constructed. With the photos, the book becomes truly unique.  For a first novel, Miss Perigrine's School for Peculiar Children is an amazing accomplishment.  That it's ripe for a sequel, perhaps even a series of books, is wonderful.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Careful, this game will eat up your entire day.<br />The main game is identical to the PC version and hold hours of fun by itself.<br /><br />On that alone it is worth the price (especially if you got it day 1, when it was free)<br />There are some extras included and they are a blast to play, but they pale in comparison to the PC versions extra features (I am unsure as to the features on the iPhone version)<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the slow loading times (if your screen goes blank, it loads again) and the lack of extra game modes.<br /><br />Neither of those are deal breakers, but you should be aware right out of the gate!

6304711905|4.0|I watched this movie for the first time a week ago, right after my first visit to Tombstone, AZ.   I loved the portrayal of Doc Holliday by Val Kilmer. I liked all the popular lines he uttered such as \\"I'm your huckleberry (or was it hucklebearer?)\\", but the best line to me was when he said \\"That's a hell of a thing for you to say to me\\" to Wyatt when he tried to keep Doc out of the gunfight. That was a telling statement of friendship to me; in other words, \\"We're friends-you're really asking me to not get involved?\\"  The most powerful scene to me was Wyatt running out in the rain after his brother Morgan has died in his arms, crying out in grief and anger, only to reappear later with the words, \\"Tell them I'm comin'-and hell's comin' with me!\\" That was good, good stuff.

0316056863|3.0|I'm a big fan of Tina Fey's work and was eagerly looking forward to reading her book. I bought it when it came out, started it and had such a lukewarm reaction that I put it aside. I finally picked it up again and while I still think she's very funny and has a knack for making the ordinary very silly, her writing and humor probably translate better on TV than on paper (I think \\"30 Rock\\" is one of the best-written shows on TV). I did enjoy the behind-the-scenes look at the TV business (I, too work in TV) and the book did have a couple of great one-liners (such as \\"The show doesn't go on when it's ready. It goes on at 11:30.\\")The portions she wrote about her dad, and the sections about being a good mother and her ennui over having a second child were nice moments in the book, too. All in all, it's a cute read. The one thing that really surprised me was some of the profanity. I'm no shrinking violet, but that caught me by surprise.
0307593495|4.0|Nothing is as it seems, and all good things come to an end.  And so, the time has come to bid adieu to Kurt Wallander.  But not before he undertakes a deeply introspective journey at the behest of his daughter, Linda, who has just made him a grandfather (although she and the baby's father have not yet decided to marry).  It appears that her putative father-in-law, a retired naval commander, has disappeared, and she and her significant other, the man's son, ask Wallander to try to find out what happened.  Is he the victim of foul play?<br /><br />Wallander has vacation time available and undertakes to investigate, but not before the missing man's wife is found dead, perhaps murdered.  Wallander muddles along, picking up all kinds of extraneous information, misleading clues, and, perhaps just as important, discerning more about himself as he more frequently suffers from lapses of memory.<br /><br />The author is well-known for his ability to address significant political themes in his novels.  And this last Wallander novel is no exception, delving deeply into the Cold War, and Sweden's \\"neutrality\\" policy.  I found the novel somewhat slow reading and difficult, and wonder if it is the writing or the translation.  Nevertheless, it is a touching look at \\"the great detective,\\" and is recommended.

B002MQYOFW|1.0|I'm a twelve year old. In other words, I'm who this book is intended for. And  found it SICK. I'm utterly disgusted by Suzanne Collins, who actually came up with this perverse idea. People like this book because it shocks them. Okay. I'm fine with that. Because the only other option is that they enjoy and anticipate each death, as readers, but also as would the Capitol audience. And don't tell me that's impossible, because people ued to pay and hire people to fight to the death as gladiators. But back to the subject; you like the book because it shocks you. But why does it shock you. Usually, when something shocks you, it is because it is a terrible, wrong, disgusting and revolting something. And this is in no way an exception. So those people who rated it five stars? Two options. Either you're dense or you're cruel.    The characters were pathetic. Every single one of them was a coward. If they'd had any guts, they would have refrained from slaughering each other. This would have made them people with principles, a sense of right and wrong. They would have had the courage to brave the wrath of the Capitol. They would have had the courage to die, to avoid becoming a killer. Had but one person refused to fight, this person would have inspired a revolution. If the districts were still living in oppresion, they had no one but themselves to blame. Katniss was an arrogant, selfish, and self centered person, if you could even call her that. Peeta was stupid and shallow.  Not even remotely likeable. And all the other tributes weren ' t even portrayed as people, but as killing machines with names to make their deaths more excusable.     Don't even get me started on the games themselves. SC has a brutal imagination. The whole thing made me feel sick. So I shall avoid the topic, as  imagine any human with feelings can very well guess what I choose not to relate.    I hated all the events preceeding thr games. Oh, so you have a 'brilliant stylist', do you? I don't quite know why that phrase irked me so much. But I do know why Katniss talking in her interview, and civilly at that, did. She would have been so much more likeable to me if she told the audience to shove off. And the fact that the tributes go for an 'angle' and can't even act like their own selves during their interview, is beyond revolting. You've got to think, they have a pretty high  chance of dying. Then do they want to be mourned for who they are or who they pretended to be?     My opinin of SC is low. As in LOW. Her book is sick and disturbing. I have no doubt SC would act just as the caracters in her book did should she be put in the same situation, and that only lowers my opinion of her. And the fact that she even thought up the perverted concept of pitting children against each other on live television is horrifying to me.     DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Not because its a bad book or a waste of time, which it most certainly is, but because it will do irrevocable damage to your concept of courage and value and belief in the goodness of humanity should you actually like it. If you must read it, do not buy it. SC does not deserve her money, which you are about to find out for yourself.
0525423273|3.0|I equally liked and dislike Anna and the French Kiss. I hate when this happens because I don't know how to review the book. So I'm going to start with what I did like.         The author knows how to write and thanks to that I finished the book. She knows how to keep the readers engaged and entertain. I loved how she described Paris and the Parisian people; it made me want to visit Paris. The characters were great especially St. Clair and Josh. St. Clair wasn't perfect like all the main characters are. He was beautiful but he wasn't tall (there's nothing wrong with being short because I'm really short) usually your main character is tall; lets just say St. Clair was different and I loved it. Josh is not a main character in the book but his presence is so strong you know he is there. And the ending I think was the best part of the book.        To me the book was too long and nothing much different happened between the main characters. Unfortunately I didn't like Anna as much as I wanted to. Sometimes she seemed a little selfish and didn't see her own mistakes but at the end she realizes that she's not perfect. To me the chemistry between St. Clair and Anna wasn't strong, until the end of the book. They were all over the place when they finally realize they liked each other..         The book is an easy and quick read. It was cute and had good characters.         SPOILER ALERT!         Now I'm going to tell you what I did not like about the book with details. Keep in mind that no matter what I say here you should read the book and decide if you like it for yourself. This is just my personal opinion.        First of all I think the title is cool but wrong for this book. Because of the title I was waiting for a kiss that didn't come until the end of the book. If the title was different I would have like the book better.         The characters had a lot of opportunity to kiss but never did. I don't mind when this happens: Boy and Girl like each other and you feel the tension building up and they are about to kiss but they don't for X reason. I quite like when this happens but not when it happens too many times. It was just painful to read these scenes in the book.         Finally, Anna and St. Clair's relationship. It began nice they were friends and did everything together and supported each other, but when they realized that they liked each other everything went wrong. They were fighting a lot and they wouldn't stay mad at each other for more than five minutes at a time. They fought, made up and act like nothing happened. It was just a little dysfunctional.         These are my reactions while reading the book:        Beginning:        \\"Cool! I like where the book is going!        Half way:        \\"Hmmmmm... Anna and the French Kiss?\\"        Almost done:        \\"Ok, I have decided the title of this book is misleading. It's more like Anna and the nonexistent make out session\\"        End of the book:        \\"Finally!! Good ending but, why wait so long?\\"
B0020TS5KQ|5.0|This film is a favorite of mine it teaches us about ourselves.  We all desire respect, friendship, acceptance,the need for community, to find the truth in ourselves.  This film is lavishly decadent in its setting,history,the depth of the characters and of course the gorgeous sound track which sweeps you off your feet as though you are apart of the celebration of life!
B000LC55F2|5.0|The Movie the Prestige is a great movie that deals with revenge,obsession, and secrecy. It has a great storyline filled with twists in every direction and has great acting which consists of Christian Bale(Batman),Hugh Jackman(Wolverine), Andy Serkis(Gollum), Michael Caine( The Butler in Batman Begins), and also Scarlett Johansson(Iron Man 2). The thing that amazed me about this movie, was that I had never heard of this movie. You always hear about Christopher Nolans two movies Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. But when It comes to the Prestige, most people have never heard of it before. That is probably because of the fact that this movie came in the middle of Batman Begins and the Dark Knight. This movie has some great twists that surprised me. And if you think about watching this movie you won't be disappointed. Than at the very end of the movie you will enjoy it and  you will say abracadavre to this great movie.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Since the first episode, I fell in love with this show. It has everything to get so popular; a group of great actresses, a great plot and very well written episodes, and i mean it by my title, this is my first TV addiction since The O.C.'s ending in 2007.<br />I just enjoy every episode, because there's drama, mystery and sometimes love in each one, if you buy this season you'll keep watching all the time, I guarantee you.<br />Next season is starting in one week, so i'll watch this DVD in a week just to refresh my mind a little.<br /><br />Just can't wait to watch the Bonus Features, because they seem to be very exciting and interesting, also Amazon is shipping everything so fast, I ordered it last Friday and i'm getting it tomorrow, just keep doing that amazing service that makes you to stand out of all those online stores.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|For many years, hearing the Foo Fighters on the radio was just that: I knew most to all the songs they played on the radio, but never really dug any deeper into their albums, because, frankly they were just another modern AOR rock band on the radio, nothing really to extraordinary about them. So when they released their Greatest Hits album last year, I decided to get it, having no albums or songs before, I even decided to go with the CD/DVD version. What a great investment it was, hearing all those Foo classics and watching the hilarious videos made me have a new found appreciation for the band, not to mention being close ties with the legendary Nirvana.<br /><br />Now the Foo's have dropped their magnum opus IMO, Wasting Light. This album defines pure rock with no strings attached, with emotionally charged songs, a triple guitar attack and an amazing rhythm section, the Foo's created a modern classic. Having former member and legendary guitarist Pat Smear back in the fold really ups the Foo's performance level(just like on TCATS, that album I bought soon after this), but besides that, I think it was time for the Foo's to show how it's done. Dave Grohl is a hero to the state of rock and roll, unfortunately having to live partially in the shadows of Kurt and the Nirvana days, he can now stand on his own and even embraced his old band by having Krist Noveselic return on I Should Have Known. This album is so very good, it makes me ponder why I never gave the Foo's more of a chance before, but now I can be sure in their cababilities in knowing by releasing this, they are to surely go down in histories books.
031261246X|5.0|This Book ROCKED!    Zero Day starts right in and never lets you go!     A modern day thriller based on possibilities that are too real.   This book grabbed me by the back of the neck and wouldn't let me look away for a moment.  I didn't dare blink and breathe.  Couldn't even put the darn thing down!    I really hope Mr. Russinovich writes another, this was great!  Far better than a night out at the movies or a day at the Ballpark!
B004VUP8WK|4.0|It was funny to see the first six reviews of this album all gave it one star on the first day of it's release. Seems to me that some people had already made up their mind from a few preview clips, and were waiting to stick the boot in without giving it a chance. Some of the Amazon reviews were almost word for word the same garbage written about this album on forums. Jumping on the bandwagon and the pack mentally is what Morbid Angel is NOT about, so if this is your state of mind, it's no surprise that you don't get ILLUD DIVINUM INSANUS. To those complaining about 'Production' and levels (drums, vox, guitars etc.), just because you have a home computer with DAW software, it doesn't make you an expert engineer, what a waste of time cliche this type of criticism is, as if there is only one sound that is acceptable and that all of this is set in stone. Every man and his dog thinks they are an audio engineer/producer these days, but obviously they are not. Good luck trying to get anything to sound anywhere near as good as this on your home computer you fools, but still they whine about what's wrong with the mix. This is a solid Morbid Angel album with some innovation and originality. Yes, the eight year wait was too long, Radikult misses the mark, and Pete 'the feet' Sandoval is not playing drums, but this album still has the Morbid Angel vibe and power that other top line bands can only try to emulate. People will remember MA in years to come, unlike the run of the mill, flavour of the month extreme metal acts that people laud as a superior alernative, the bands that would sound nothing like they currently do if not for the MORBID ANGEL legacy. Welcome back David Vincent (one of the greatest voices in extreme metal) and please come back Pete Sandoval (one of the coolest drummers in extreme metal) for the next album, and please don't leave us waiting another eight years.

0061537969|4.0|This is a story of family tragedy and dissolution told from a fresh point of view - by Enzo, the family dog. His owner is a race car driver trying to work his way up through the ranks to the Formula 1 circuit. Much of the storyline is predictable, but the unique point of view of the narrator and the parables and philosophy drawn from auto racing make this a worthy read.
0131103628|2.0|I'm a Java programmer with 10 years of experience, and I decided to get into C/C++ programming. While I have no issues with following the logic of the code in the book, the examples frequently look like the authors never actually tried to run them. Some examples don't do quite what the authors advertise (the Polish calculator), and others simply have incorrect code. For instance, the keyword counting example in Chapter 6 goes into an infinite loop (hangs) at the first non-keyword in the input. There is simply no provision in the code for non-keywords.     The authors seem obsessed with efficiency of C and the ability to write very compact code. However, in this quest they have apparently simplified and streamlined it to the point of being wrong.    As a summary: this book may be a reasonable read for someone with programming experience (NOT for a complete novice), but any attempts to run the provided code examples will likely be a highly frustrating experience.
B004VUP8WK|3.0|Earlier, I posted a review for this album when it was first dropped(June 7th), and from the first listens, I thought it was absolute rubbish. The experimentation they decided to go into was just too much for me, and like many of you. They had gone too far(extreme? *crickets*) But, having the album for a couple weeks now, I found myself today with some of the songs in my head. Well, this is quite odd for me, it must either be so bad I can't forget or, something eles..<br />I truely believe in the later. This is so different and drastic, and that they seemed to have strayed to a different genre of electronic-death metal. So many of you, including me, came here for one of the originators of death metal, but this is not what they want to be. I think alot of the real fans can agree with what i'm trying to say, that Morbid Angel's soul intention is to keep throwing fans off and their heads spinning. Whether it worked or not, well just look at the reviews on here.<br />For the music, it's simplistic, so much so that it gets into your psyche like that annoying catchy advertisement tune. I think this is perhaps their intention, not to gain fans of Lady Gaga(who?), but more mainstreamed metal fans. Right now, this new music of dubstep is really starting to catch on in the states, so this could be their scapegoat for those fans who also enjoy metal. Now, the other side of the arguement, yes their is self-loathed moments on here, before the album was released, just looking at the song titles alone, something didn't seem right. They sounded like soom cheesy 80's glam titles or some way over-the-top extreme band that was laughable. I do believe there is some strong guilty pleasures of the band present here. Playing such extreme music all these years, maybe, just maybe, they want to expand the horizons, but unfortunately, this type of music in which they started with is not a very forgiving or dare I say it, opened minded crowd. So, take this to mind next time you listen to this album, or any album past, present, or future; Who doesn't self-indulge once in a while? Who doesn't wanna completely baffle everyone sometime in their life? For a death metal album, I still give it a 1&1/2 out of 10 stars, for 3 decent songs, nothing extraordinary well done. For a music album, I give it 3. For hopefully exhausting all self-indulgence I give it a 10/10.r any album past, present, or future; Who doesn't self-indulge once in a while?

0756405890|4.0|I was drawn to THE NAME OF THE WIND for its characterization and careful world-building. For some reason it's the type of story that kept taunting me to poke and prod for lapses in continuity or ways to dislike the characters. It's clearly well-put-together, but I kept arguing with myself about why I liked it and why I didn't.    One answer probably lies in the masterful layers of the storytelling. It's the first in a series, so really in a sense just a prologue; an author is telling the story, but he has wrapped it in the hands of his hero to dig into his own past; a nondescript third person is arrived at in the brief interludes - which give us clues as to where the story is going. In other words, Rothfuss foreshadows the past with the present, instead of the future with the past! It is a fascinating, backwards tug-and-pull way of telling the tale.    It's also at times poetic, although in probably a more contrived than flowing or lyrical manner. And of course the hero himself is a master storyteller, but we don't know what lens he is telling his own tale through because we don't know the end of the story yet, and at the same time we are aware that it can't possibly be the end of his story, since he is only about 25...    Which leads us to the unbelievable side of things. Kvothe is so young that it seems like the author has to work very hard to convince us that there is a good reason for his cleverness despite his age. And I also kept doing double-takes with the female characters in the book. I didn't know if I could trust them to be as solidly written as Kvothe himself. I'm still not sure. Finally, the good prose often lapsed into poor editing and reminders of the story (Kvothe keeps talking about how this is \\"not a storybook tale\\" -- a jarring trope that caused me to keep rationalizing the repetition to myself).    In the end, a clever novel, but not necessarily a deep, far-reaching one, probably because the characters themselves failed to grip me, but reading about those characters was definitely an interesting ride. And I did get lulled into the pure enjoyment of reading such a well-crafted tale: it is clever and worthwhile.
B00280LYHS|2.0|OK, the whole thing is fun.  I like the series and love his jokes.     My disappointment with this series is the prophecy.  I would have rated the book 5 stars if not for it.    OK.  On page 50, Percy reads it from a parchment:  \\"A half-blood of the eldest gods   shall reach sixteen against all odds  and see the world in endless sleep.  The hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap.  A single choice shall end his days.  Olympus to preserve or raze.\\"    Given that this prophecy has been built up since book 1, the interpretation at the end is just unacceptable to me.      **SPOILER**  Here's Percy thinking over the meaning of the prophecy at the end.     \\"As they left, I thought about the Great Prophecy.  The lines now made sense to me.  A hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap.  The hero was Luke.\\"      WHAT?  NO.  The prophecy says \\"THE\\" hero's soul not \\"A\\" hero's soul.  THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING.  So, Percy is a half-blood of the eldest gods mentioned in the first line.  If it follows with THE hero's soul, then it must mean Percy's soul.  But if it follows by A hero's soul, then it's someone else's soul.  Everybody has been fussing and worrying in the whole time because it says THE and it means PERCY.  That's how I understand it and everybody in the series understand it.  You can't change the word around to mean someone else just like that.    I do understand that sometimes prophecy may be vague and misunderstood and whatever.  But I also expect every word of it to mean something and not to change to fit the events that happen later.      Also the \\"HIS\\" in \\"a single choice shall end HIS days\\" should mean the said half-blood's and would suggest that the said half-blood is a boy.  Why did they think it could be Thalia or Bianca??  (I know why, because the content of the prophecy was not revealed to READERS earlier so it seemed to us Thalia or Bianca could be the one.  Well, us readers did not know by CHIRON knows.  So this doesn't make any sense that Chiron and the gods would worry about the two girls.)      **END SPOILER**
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I watched all the T.V shows of Firefly and fell in love with the cast. I was devastated when they ended the series.  Fortunately they made a movie and omg it was epic.  I only own a few movies by choice and this is one that made the cut. Absolutely entertaining and well written I have this whole movie memorized.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|Of course it is excellent: it's directed by Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />The film follows three characters: a French TV journalist who has a near death experience, a psychic (Matt Damon) who has turned his back on his gift, and to me the most touching of all, a young boy whose identical twin brother is killed.<br /><br />The acting is excellent, the movie keeps you interested, and it was well worth seeing. Very different. But very good. I didn't see the trailer or have any preconceptions, so I had no disappointments.
0449000729|2.0|This book starts off very well.  However, the book is about 400 pages too long.  There's a reason why the period between the fall of the western Roman Empire and the Renaissance is called \\"the middle ages\\", yet this book has hundreds of pages dedicated to telling this story.  For some reason, every English author who writes a book about England feels compelled to tell us, ad nauseum, about the myopic minutia of the lives of the aristocracy as compared to the lives of the common folk.  This book is no different.  Every English author feels compelled to tell us stories about how shallow, overwrought characters sit around talking about how so-and-so is fine gentleman, and worthy of marriage, but his accounts are not quite in order.  Oh, what a scandal.  His accounts you say?  Why yes, there was the incident only last week where, against my better discretion, so-and-so received an unfortunate price for his wares.  Oh, dear, how unfortunate?  Well, let us say, he might not be marriagable after all.  Oh dear.  This type of droll goes on for page after page after page after page.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|Originally released in 1983, this is the the lone, unjustly overlooked amazing album released by Sabbath. After the falling out with Dio(R.I.P.) and the infamous Live Evil album, Sabbath was left with only Tony and Geezer(Vinny left by this time as well). They recruited former Deep Purple vocalist Ian Gillan for this album, and welcome back Bill Ward on drums. When the album was released, there was a great travesty surrounding it, particularly over the final mix of the album, to which Ian is reported to have 'puked when I heard it'. No matter the mix, Sabbath had turned out an all out hard-rock/metal album, filled with some of Tony's best riffs to date. Even Ozzy stated how much he enjoyed the album. But as soon as things came together, they fell apart just as fast. Bill was unable to tour, so ELO drummer Bev Bevin was brought in four the tour, now famous for the pre-Spinal Tap stonehenge stage sets and midget devils. After the tour, Ian parted ways to re-join his Deep Purple Mark 2 line up band mates for their reunion the following year with Perfect Strangers. Sabbath was inactive for a few years afterwords.<br /><br />As for this 2011 Deluxe Edition, it is one of the best yet. For the sound, it's not a remix like they were hoping to do, unfortunately the tapes could not be found(really Sony??) but it is stated they still want to do a remix when/if the tapes are found. But overall, it sounds alot better than the version before it. Alot of the harshness is gone, it sounds alot less distorted and balanced out correctly. It's nicely cleaned up as well. I would say it's the closest to the vinyl, if not better, because even the vinyl's mix was distorted. Overall, it's good for what they had to work with. As for the 2nd disc, the outtake track The Fallen is nice little song, could have definately fit on the album. The extended version of Stonehenge is also cool, but nothing more than just an extended version. Apparently Tony plays flute, but because of the mix, you really can't hear it. The Reading Festival show is really worth it for the price, this is some of the best live Sabbath I've heard. Ian really knows how to get the crowd rolling, and his singing on Sabbath classics like 'Black Sabbath' are just downright frightening at times. This is definately a must-buy for the fans, for the cleaned up sound and the impressive extras. I myself can't wait for the next Deluxe Editions of the Tony Martin Era albums, espeically the epic Headless Cross album.hear it.

0312600844|3.0|Like any book that receives this much critical acclaim, \\"Freedom,\\" contains something that appeals to a wide and disparate group. It resembles Franzen's previous book, \\"The Corrections,\\" in its focus on a dysfunctional family. And when Franzen writes dysfunctional characters there is generally a sexual element to their relational issues. The dysfunction sexual relationships that are the centerpiece of Franzen's writing no doubt contributes to his popularity. Franzen almost had the dubious distinction of winning the Bad Sex in fiction prize.<br /><br />A secondary element that makes the book popular, is its being held up as a model of \\"America,\\" and the benefits and problems of unbridled freedom. It is claimed that it embodies some key American experiences, and to a certain extent this is true. However, due to the focus on a specific time and issues, the writing is limited and the book itself is not likely to be interesting to readers a decade from now.<br /><br />One serious problem that I had with the book is Franzen's writing which leaves some characters one-dimensional, and gives the impression that they are only written in to move the plot along.<br /><br />This is an interesting (mostly) readable book, but probably not a good representation of anything specifically \\"American.\\" It is far more accurate to describe it as simply an adequate novel.

The only regret is that they didn't David Fincher the money to re-cut Alien 3. The right actors, composer and Fincher, this movie could have been the best of the series! Instead I will settle for the re-cut! Bon Appatit.

0812973992|3.0|This novel centers on Philippe Petit's tightrope walk between the Twin Towers on August 7th, 1974. This single event has been taken as the starting point by Colum McCann from which the lives of a multitude of individuals are effected.<br /><br />Each individual is given a chapter to delineate their world. There is the Irish priest and his brother working in the South Bronx and the prostitutes that the priest is attempting to help. Another story is added by a wealthy housewife whose son was killed in Vietnam. With each narrative strand added to the story it becomes clearer how all of their lives are intertwined. The final chapter is set in 2006 and brings the story to a satisfactory conclusion.<br /><br />McCann's strategy in this novel allows in-depth views of his characters on the days before the tightrope walk, and the day of the walk. Notably absent are any details about Petit, but perhaps that is because he is a real person.

1400079276|3.0|What is a reader supposed to think when the back of a book such as Kafka on the Shore states that it is \\"A magnificently bewildering achievement...Brilliantly conceived, bold in its surreal scope, sexy and driven by a snappy plot...exuberant storytelling\\" (Independent on Sunday). Or that it is \\"Addictive\\" (multiple blurbs). Addiction is defined as \\"The condition of being habitually or compulsively occupied with or or involved in something\\" (theFreedictionary). Sexy implies that there is some type of sexually attractive person or activity in the book. However, what these two words mean in book blurbs is quite different than what their dictionary definitions, and of the two only addictive might apply to this novel by Haruki Murakami.<br /><br />The premise is that the fifteen year Kafka is trying to escape an Oedipal prophesy, passed on him by his father, and ends up in a library with helpful, but unusual employees. There are many incidents, some of which involve sex, but none of which could be described as particularly sexy. They are perhaps sad, violent, or disturbing, though.<br /><br />Another narrative thread follows a rather simple elderly man, Nakata, who has the unusual skill of speaking with cats, and by this means locating the occasional stray feline. The paths of Kafka and Nakata never actually cross, but their stories are intertwined with each other.<br /><br />The end of the book is quite open to interpretation. There are unanswered questions, and the reader must be willing to either tolerate ambiguity or form hypotheses that are satisfactory.<br />[...]

I rarely read novels but this was worthy of the reviews that it has received.  loved the British humor. Does make you appreciate the sacrifices that England endured both before and after the war.

B00006GEB4|5.0|'Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots' is certainly one of The Flaming Lips' best albums. It isn't as \\"hardcore\\" as some of their other albums regarding the electronic part of the music. The title track, \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt. 1,\\" actually has predominant acoustic guitar instrumentation. Many of the songs are upbeat and cheery, and I highly recommend this album if you are not familiar with the band but would like to try them out.    This vinyl edition exhibits the artwork in very good quality, and the actual vinyl is a transparent red color. My only reservation is that the label in the center of the record does not list the songs on each side, but it is fashionable with some bands.
1416562605|3.0|This is an epistolary novel and Balram is writing to Wen Jiabao. Hearing on the radio that Wen Jiabao wants to meet Indian entrepreneurs Balram volunteers to recount how he became an entrepreneur. Over the course of seven nights he tells his story.<br /><br />As a boy Balram was successful in school and aspired to leave his village for the city. Learning how to drive he succeeds in becoming a driver, a prestigious occupation for someone of his background. Unfortunately, as he outlines philosophically, he (and all Indians) are constrained by \\"the great Indian rooster coop\\" which prevents any one individual from escaping their prison of indebtedness and familial obligations to become really free. As soon as someone tries to escape they are dragged back down with the rest of the chickens. Balram, however, has found a way out of the coop as only a white tiger can.<br /><br />I did not find Balram to be an admirable or likable character. His lack of familial responsibility or affection is aberrant by any cultural standard.<br />[...]

Dave has a great sense of humour, and his life wasnt all it seemed it was, and I am glad for his disclosure. I found out things about him that were eerily similiar to my own life. This was not too sappy, nor was it too harsh, it was just right. Thank you Dave for this chance to see behind the stage....

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great game.  I gave it five stars, despite a few quirks.  Even though I beat the game, I find myself still playing it. It comes off like a tower defense game, but the creative style gives it a very distinct and fun personality.  It's also the most interactive defense game I've played.  The bonus levels mixed in give some nice variety.  Who doesn't like bowling for zombies?<br /><br />My only complaint is the poor android adaptation.  They aren't the first game I've seen ported from iOS that fails to consider multitasking and thus transitioning in and out of standby, or switching to check a message and switching back always results in one of those long \\"Loading...\\" animations.  Also, for some reason when I beat the game the device storage jumped up dramatically which is frustrating on my Nexus One with limited storage space.  Hopefully both will get fixed soon.
B003Q6CUAI|5.0|Hi there...I wanted to share this with other post partum moms because I have had great success with Dukan. I began my diet at 5 3.5 and 142 pounds. Pre pregnancy I had weighed 130. I was reasonably slim but not happy with my weight. I began this diet and saw a few pounds disappear in the first couple of days. I persisted because I was so desperately unhappy with my body after the baby. The diet is fairly easy because you can eat until you are satisfied. I truly like the 'lean' protein aspect of it, and also the fact that there is an exact list of what you can and cannot eat. I was quite confused on South Beach and never quite got the hang of it. This diet is clear and concise. There really is no room for error. If you follow it, you WILL lose the weight. If you don't, it won't work. I have followed it extremely closely and am now down to 122...a total loss of 20 pounds. I feel great and now need to buy a new wardrobe. I highly recommend this diet to anyone wanting to lose baby weight. It works. I am currently still in the consolidation phase which keeps you from backsliding into old habits and helps you into a maintenance of your new weight. Good stuff.

He stands over your shoulder repeating one thing, incessantly: 'Get it done, get it done.' So you work harder. You get the job done. The boss, however, does not thank you. He asks for more.\\" - Death<br /><br />Books set in 1930's Germany are guaranteed to be dark in theme, and The Book Thief is no exception. Markus Zusak anthropomorphizes death; Death is the narrator. Throughout the novel Death describes his job, of collecting human souls, stressful, and difficult. The juxtaposition of Death complaining and the horror of death and war that he is describing as a busy period of work make for a peculiar narrative. The fact that he is just doing his job by collecting souls echoes the Nazi claims that they were just doing their jobs'.<br /><br />Zusak allows Death to have a poetic view of the world. Seeing every human soul as a different color is Death's way of dealing with the world, \\"You see, to me, for just a moment, despite all of the colors that touch and grapple with what I see in this world, I will often catch an eclipse when a human dies.\\" Death is sympathetic toward the world - though from his point of view the survivors are sadder than the dead. The use of Death as the narrator minimizes the historical particuliarity of Nazi Germany. Since death has always existed and occurs at all times regardless of war or human suffering this aspect of the book actually distances the story from the specific circumstances.<br /><br />For Liesel Meminger the historical circumstances are not important either, only her own. A Communist father and a mother who is unable to care for Liesel causes the authorities to put her in a foster home where she is cared for by an elderly couple. Liesel, though ten years old, cannot read when she arrives, but with the help of her foster father she learns. Her enjoyment of books encourages her in the stealing of and eventually in the creation of her own book.

0393338959|4.0|Joseph Stiglitz's efforts as an economist were recognized when he was awarded Nobel Prize in Economics along with Akerlof and Spence \\"for their analyses of markets with asymmetric information\\". In this book he at his advantage in recognizing situations where markets fail to deliver efficient results, - when information for making decisions are not distributed equally between participants. It occurs, for example, when some (let us call them) special interests can put their efforts not in increasing the quality of their products and services, but in overcoming legislation and regulation.    On the other hand, when he tries to blame free market economics almost in every problem of the world economy (which appears quiet often in this book) he in effect shows his misunderstanding of the basic logic, not presenting any strict proofs or at least elaborating on what he is stating. In general case it goes like this: we need more regulation because free markets failed to deliver efficient results. Not mentioning the fact that regulators was before the crisis and failed to regulate well, and not asking the question of why he considers markets were already free.    The strange thing is that by himself he rightly criticizes large businesses in pushing/lobbying their special interests without taking into account social interests. In that sense he recognizes that regulation failed, not markets. Hence, Mr. Stiglitz contradicts to himself.    He also often misrepresents some problems. Let me explain this in one example (and there are a lot of them in this book). Mr. Stiglitz blames monetarism by stating: \\"Milton Friedman's monetarism tried to constrain central banks to a mechanical rule of increasing the money supply at a fixed rate. When that failed, conservatives looked for another simple rule targeting inflation\\". As I remember, according to Mr. Friedman no country ever implemented monetary targeting in the most strict form. Maybe Germany was close to that in 70s and 80s of 20thcentury, and we know about Germany economy as one of the strongest even today. Another question then follows, what Mr. Stiglitz meant by \\"failed\\" in this context, if no money supply targeting regime ever existed?    As a summary, the book is full of quite interesting thoughts and ideas about recent financial crisis, but sadly it fails at logic quite often. In comparison to N. Roubini's book on recent crisis (Crisis Economics), even if the latter is not so \\"uncovering\\" regarding special interests, is actually more consistent in statements. Nevertheless, if you want to know more about recent events in the world economy with more focus on the US, I would recommend reading Mr. Stiglitz's Freefall.

0307719774|4.0|I love this idea of a five year journal.  I am very curious to see who I am, how I change, what influences me over the next five years.  I'll be getting married and planning to start a family, so I know this is going to be an interesting introspective journey.    Having said that, my criticism of the book is that it is simply too small.  I'm not sure why they chose to publish it this size, but they should have made it larger because there is very little space for each entry.    I'm fifty-fifty on the journaling topics.  Each day has its own topic, such as, \\"What is your favorite movie?\\" or some such question.  It certainly would be interesting to see how responses change year to year.  But I think I will only use those for prompts on days when nothing else comes to mind.    So, overall, a great idea.  Again, wish it were larger.

0061537969|5.0|My husband and I recently adopted a dog and this book was recomended when I purchased a few books on training dogs.  This was such a sweet and touching novel, and while Enzo's owner Denny frustrated me at times, it really didn't matter because the storyteller of this novel, Enzo the dog, is so loveable and wonderful, you just wanted to follow with him on his journey.  I love a good book and a good cry, and I have to say that this gave me both.
0470424656|5.0|No doubt, it is one of the best texts on valuation ever written. I previously read in part the 3rd edition, but recently have bought the last 5th edition, and should say that it only became better. Even if you are a seasoned professional and have not read the book yet, just buy it and read it. Any detailed remarks on this one would be unnecessary, - Amazon has lots of comments on this one.  I just want to mention, that in contrast to other valuation texts (except maybe for Damodaran's), it is very consistent and logical in its form, and is very readable giving the fact that it is a finance text.

B0023P7ZF8|5.0|I would like to rate this item as 4.5 stars, something Amazon does not allow, for the following reasons:    As a vinyl (LP) product this is the BEST vinyl I have acquired recently, bar none.  Virtually no surface noise, superb reproduction of the mid and low frequencies (highs are good, but this group sounds does not tend to be trebly, but doom-like and toward the bass/mid ranges), nice group poster inside, and all lyrics are reprinted.  Again, if you want to come back to the sound of vinyl, and if you like this type of sludgy heavy metal, this is the record to own.  (I do not have the CD, so I cannot compare to it, but I doubt that it could beat this LP by much, again, because of the warm sound reproduced and the very LOW surface noise).      The music is reminiscent of the Black Sabbath's Dehumanizer album, more than the Mob Rules and/or Heaven and Hell albums that they had produced in the 80s (early 90s, too?).   So, if you like the Dehumanizer album, I strongly feel you will like this one too.  After three hearings I can say that although it is a good solid effort, it is no masterpiece, musically-wise.  The songs are good, the riffs are good, but not spectacular.  Nothing that has not been done before by this group's members is found here.      Hopefully, with more listenings, I will enjoy it the same or more that I have done so far. Like it happened when I discovered the Dehumanizer album, which is now my favorite Black Sabbath album after Master of Reality.      enjoy!

B004MNVKVO|3.0|I have listened to this album for years, as my brother is a big fan of this group and this album in particular.     When I played the blu ray edition, I came with the impression that the well-advertised 5.1 experience was not up to par to both a blu ray audio release nor to this great classic album.  The vocals sound a little muddy and on the background, and the 5.1 effect is not that well executed/implemented.  If you own the Metallica's Black Album DVD Audio release, you will find it beats this Rush release in the 5.1 separation and soundscape.  I was expecting something similar (and limited, of course, because this Rush album was recorded much earlier than the Metallica album) but to my ears it does not deliver the goods.    I like that you may see the lyrics while the music plays and that you also get a CD that you may take with you in the car.  The videos included are so-and-so.  And I remember a mistake in the Bluray menu where the 5.1 DD sound choice is actually a 2.0 LPCM audio stream.  But I am not quite sure right now, because I played it briefly, and because I bought this edition for the DTS 5.1 sound stream (and is the one I have used to listen to the whole album so far).      enjoy!

B001P3OMY6|5.0|I normally don't leave reviews. I normally don't regularly read what I call \\"glorified\\" fan fiction. But for some reason, Austenland had it's special something. I'm glad I picked it up. I finished it in a day and I will definitely be buying it. Normally, I get stuff from the library to \\"test it out\\" first to see if I will like it. Yes, I'm a tight wad. :) And I don't want to spend money on something and not enjoy the experience.    I love Jane Austen and I love the Regency era. It was nice to step back in time with a 21st Century girl. It's kind of funny, because I can relate to Jane. I've not had as many boyfriends, but I can relate to circumstances that she's been in. And I'm sure most woman can. And, darn you Mr. Darcy, so being so dashing and charming. Mr. Nobley....what can I say about him. I wish more men were romantic like him. Then again, most men aren't and the whole \\"romance\\" section gives us girls false hope. There ARE a rare few men out there that \\"get it\\".     I can't wait to curl up and read this again. The characters are enchanting and in some way, I seem to understand all the women that come to Pembrook Park. At least their Regency characters. I see a little of me in each of them.    And as much as I am not a fan of sequels, I would love to see where the story finished off....maybe there is one and I haven't discovered it yet? Hmmm...
B003Y5H51K|3.0|\\"What could possibly go wrong diving in caves?\\"  While trying to explore an unseen part of the world a group of divers become trapped in an underwater cave.  When they realize the only way out is to keep going the hardship begins.  This is based on a true story, much like \\"The Way Back\\" it involves a group trying to escape to freedom.  Not only do they have to deal with the elements, but also the other divers trying to escape by any means necessary. The best way to explain this is \\"The Way Back\\" in water.  If you liked that movie you will like this one as well.  Very suspensful and thrilling but also very slow moving in some parts.  Entertaining and adventerous but be prepared for it to be a little slow.  Overall not a bad movie, but nothing amazing. I give it a B-.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - I don't think I will<br /><br />*Also try - The Cave & The Way Back

0307595862|3.0|Jo Nesbo's detective novel, The Snowman, kept me on edge and engaged from beginning to end. Detective Harry Hole struggles with alcohol, relationships and a serial killer, always thinking and putting the pieces together. Multiple suspects provide the requisite twists and turns to the plot, and give Nesbo the opportunity to allow Hole to relax briefly and then forge ahead rapidly. It was hot weather when I read this novel, and the chill of the story provided welcome refreshment. Fans of detective novels are most likely to enjoy this finely written one.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

B002ZG9800|3.0|Although I enjoyed some scenes in this movie, and felt Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor turned in good performances and did some interesting things with their characters, overall I didn't think it worked. I think the problem is that it could not decide what it wanted to be. It started out like a fairly typical off-the-wall Jim Carrey comedy, but in other movies that works because his character is generally likeable, and we side with him. In this film, as his swindles and lies get bigger and bigger, I found it harder and harder to like his character, or to find the humor in it. Plus prison, deception, AIDS, and homosexuality are not easy comedic material anyway. And I think this story got hampered by the fact it was based on a true story. I read some reviews that compared the quirky tone of this to Coen brothers films, but those are generally fiction as far as I know, so they don't have the hindrance of trying to follow the basic outlines of a true story.<br /><br />On the other hand, it is amazing that so many of the prison escapes and cons in this movie actually did occur (google fact vs fiction on I Love Phillip Morris for details.) But while that adds interest, it doesn't actually change the experience of watching the movie. Overall, a solid 3 stars for me - some funny moments and good performances, but the film as a whole didn't come together.
0439023483|5.0|Hunger Games, Scholastic Press, e-book edition by Suzanne Collins is probably one of the best Fantasy books I ever have read.<br />Briefly, it is an anti-war, anti-dictator story set in a world of twelve working sections of the country controlled by, and answerable to, a powerful Central group. Each sub-group is responsible for different products - agriculture, mining , etc. - and must supply quotas to the Central group. The quota is huge with the members of the districts usually suffering much as did the serfs in Feudal times. Formerly there were thirteen sub-groups, but one was completely annihilated because it had rebelled against the Central government. Yearly `games' are held where two members of each sub-division , a girl and boy drawn by lot, must compete to the death against the rest until there is only one survivor. The story is constructed around one of the girls chosen as a competitor.<br />There have been numerous reviews of this book on Amazon, and none less than four stars. My personal opinion is that they are well deserved, so there is little I can add. I should recommend this book as a most enjoyable read and look forward to reading the second in this trilogy.

B004Q7E0TA|5.0|Portia lets the reader into her world in this book.  I was touched at the honesty and, dare i say it, humor, that she inserted into her story.  Anyone who has battled with self image or known someone who you desperately needed to help feel better about themselves in regard to their body should read this book.  It is not a book about a celebrity, it is just a book about a person, who is a celebrity, looking to share her experience because she can. i loved it.
B002ZG976U|3.0|I genuinely enjoyed the music, dancing and costumes in this, especially the more classic Burlesque pieces, with their sexy-funny-teasy-edgy flair. But the writing and acting was soooooo bad. My husband and I found ourselves just grimacing and groaning through certain scenes, especially those between Christina Aguilara and her love interest in the movie, played by Cam Gigandet from Twilight. Every line was a cliche, and even the best of actors (and these two are not) could not have saved them. I was also disappointed in Cher, who didn't feel very invested in the movie - she seemed to be phoning it in. Stanley Tucci was entertaining, and the only time I saw any of Cher's usual spark was in her scenes with him. The storyline had many loopholes, and basically was on the level of a cheesy TV episode.<br /><br />But the music, costumes and dancing were great, so I had fun during all of that. I think this movie was marketed poorly - they should have played up the campiness and everyone might have overlooked the bad writing/acting. But the studio tried to position it as a classy drama/musical, ala Chicago or Moulin Rouge, and the performances just weren't at that level. Then they threw in some scenes that stank of contract fulfillment - a complete non-sequitor Cher singing scene for instance - that undermined the integrity of the movie completely.<br /><br />I appreciate the 5-star reviewers here taking issue with the critics' panning of this movie, but I think they are over-correcting. Critics said it was a 1 or 2 star film, I think the music/dance productions get it to a 3-star, but 5-star? Come on!
0765348276|1.0|Since most people just want to have quick idea about what they should expect from the product I'll keep this very short and to the point.If what you are looking for is just another action packed book which lacks both imagination and intelligence this one may serve you well.On the other hand if you are looking for a real sci-fi book I highly recommend you to stay away from Old Man's War as well as any other book written by this author.

It installs in seconds in the roof-top on any Bruder truck.

0452289963|3.0|Please consider Luke 13:1-5; and, forgive me, my comments are meant in kindness and modified collegiality with some with subtle strength of some thought out words, but Tolle missed the mark in Christian inspirational literature (non-mystical)...and people must not be misled, none of them should be misled about the difference between Tolle's work and the Bible.  Tolle gives a literary criticism on the biblical prophecy foreseeing the new world, and he mentions for a moment that this involves Jesus Christ, Redeemer, but the fact is, Tolle's book simply overlooks the independent statement in biblical truth that faith in Jesus Christ will be the saving grace and a portal to the future new world, and that Jesus Christ will judge according to this, and will judge accorrding to sacrifices, I believe, made in faith, and good works that redeem a person from their sins, made in faith.  And, Jesus invites people to have faith, but they must seek to have faith, and live a balanced life with principles and measures of morality, through Jesus and in Him.  Tolle gives a multi-lateral and multi-faceted picture or domain of a new earth, but these salient Bible points are not included in his philosophy.  I didn't say he is a damned liar, just that in circumspect of the Bible prophecy and precepts, Eckhart Tolle missed all the main points.  And, please remember, it is well appreciated that in the Bible, the concept of saving and redemption reveals the ultimate fact that Jesus Christ is the author of acceptance or rejection to heaven, and maintains the power to judge all humans with respect to their good works and their rejections of God and heaven.            Again, I did not say Tolle is damned or say his readers are not going to be good people, I just added criticism, with some references to scripture.  The importance of faith and the imminent judgment of Christ, is a simple concept through many, many dialects and versions of Christianity, and, with the itinerant fact that faith isa gift we SEEK and is GIFTED to US FROM Jesus Christ alone, and no one else, esp. not Inghart Tolle, or his book. But this is not Christian mystical writing, I'd look instead to St. John of the Cross, St. Catherine of Avilla, St. Augustine, St. Patrick, Acts of the Apostles, Romans, Collosians, or Ephesians.  In the books following the four Gospels, you get a direct interpretation of the Gospels, written by the Apostles, and with interpretation of Salvation and Faith concepts, in the Bible.           Textually, the book talked about \\"A New World\\" in Jesus' teaching in the first chapter as a subtext for the book, but the book is not a transcription or a translation of the Word in the Gospel.  In the Word of Luke,  Jesus remarks, in response to the proposition by his follower that people murdered in Galilee by the government were greater sinners.  And Jesus says, twice, \\"By no means!  I tell you, if you do not repent, you will all perish as they did.\\"  Jesus Christ clearly warns that the non-repentant will suffer death, in the resurrection of the Word, which Jesus announces in his Gospel message, which is well known to all readers and transcribers of the Bible who announce God's eternal Word in an effort to help stragglers maintain and associate with the life of Christ and, but Luke does not fool around on the cconcept that repentance is hard work to achieve, that it takes time and sacrifice, and avoiding sin, and repentance.   Tolle's work in no way transcribes this struggle, and fails to note that sinners would take warning to repent along with the invitation to seek the salvation and resurrection message of Jesus Christ, if they are to gain admission to the Body of Christ.  Tolle's book sums the struggle to reach the new world in phrases like \\"This, too, shall pass,\\" and, such that we are all unified in a world community.  But Jesus Christ is the Redemptorist, the Judge of humanity to find salvation, and only then, when surpassing the determinate judgment of JesusChrist, who opens the narrow gate to the new world of heaven on Earth.  Neither does Tolle speak on the determinate factor in Salvation of real faith in Jesus Christ, beliefs that according to scripture can lead to salvation, with good repentance from bad worlds that people enliven in their thoughts and that reject the scriptures, and their moral meanings in prophecy of the final resurrection to come at the end when Jesus returns in triumph over all evil that is veiled.  Tolle waters down and neglects the reality of Jesus Christ's mastery over judgment to make the new heaven on earth, with a door to all people.  Tolle diffuses Christ's ownership of eternal judgment over all people central to the Gospels with his figurative references to Buddhism (while not, insult intended to Buddhism from me!), psychology precepts, community building principle (close but a miss)--all unrelated to the final judgment and sacrifice of humanity before the Lord that will occur at the unknown hour the Lord will come in glory.   (updated comments, 6.15.2011)  I am very open to criticism and I accept this as a writer, just as Tolle's open to criticism, and let a reader's faith and soul inspiration measure what is right in God's world, among heaven and earth.    Part I, publ. 5.31.2011  I think people, writers, and critics, self-help books hear this call, people demanding a sign, something of meaning, if they are in some kind of religion, they want to put the best into it. If they are not religious, they want to have the best kind of psychology and meaning.  There's some difference between the two worth consideration and discussion.  The people writing these books think they are making a sign, but if they swerve all around to counter philosophies, from Buddhism, to Eastern philosophies, trying to make a coherent picture, the issue is that these different beliefs do not fit together in the same book that creates a Christian renewal and vision or framework for understanding the mind, and improving the human inter-relational view, from friendships, to family views, to marriage and parenthood.  To say \\"This, too, will pass\\" sounds good, because it quotes a famous George Harrison song, but it is not a holistic pro-creational view that gets the ego moving in the positive inter-relational view of a more related and central soul beliefs vision of harmony.  To say \\"This, too, will pass\\" neglects the need to recreate dysfunctional systems, in the person, in the ego, the center part where the person decides what to think, how to feel, what to create and input into the views of the people around, what to add, in becoming more whole.  And, it doesn't relate to a vision of dualism really where some government systems and social systems are wrong, will not pass without being forced, and where people are eliminated for beliefs by evil decision makers who have power, dictators.  Anyone could take the right view of this book, it is artistic, collegial, centristic, but not holistically correct.  The Buddhist monk, indicated by this phrase is finding inner peace, but the ayatola dictator in Syria and Libya is killing thousands, and the black preacher on television, getting emotional and raising up the crowd is moving active hearts in a community to become unified in that community, not absent from it as a silent meditator who decides that he can work through books and introspection to \\"free the self\\" this modern trend in psychological self-help literature, that is, in relation to my first substantive recognition of the astounding concept: religious literature releasing the concept of redemption is different from the psycho-babble self-help literature that puts a pseudo-science relational aspective procreative view into the minds of the quick and numerous followers, and weaves a false vision of prophecy around a unified view of all religions and science and philosophy.  This is not a negative, it is a decision about how someone can spend time, but the failure of modern books to focus on self-help through introspection and \\"feel good about me\\" and \\"look in the mirror and smile\\" is more of an absent independence from the actively distressed world around.     The final point I would like to make in summation releases this book from my purview as good inspirational literature.  Please let me explain.  The jargon on page 23, at the end of chapter one, indicates a sketchy interpretation of the New Testament, by stating, directly, in italics for emphasis, and quoting the book exactly, \\"`A new heaven' is the emergence of a transformed state of human consciousness, and \\"a new earth\\" is its reflection in the physical realm.\\"  This is not in accord with substantive beliefs of faithful Christians of many sects and Catholics, who agree, with considerable variation, but differentially from Eckhart Tolle, that the door to salvation, the new heaven which Eckhart Tolle is referring to, Jesus speaks, \\"Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter but will not be strong enough.  After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door, then you will stand outside and saying, `Lord, open the door for us.' He will say to you in reply, `I do not know where you are from.' And you will say, `We ate and drank and you taught in our company in our streets.  Then he will say to you, `I do not know where [you] are from. Depart from me, all you evildoers!\\"  (Luke 13:22-27).  There is substantive disregard in Tolle's prose for the relational aspects of the new world he talks about figuratively, and biblical prophecy that real Salvation will demand judgment upon the person from Jesus Christ.  Implicated in Tolle's prose is the undercurrent often in psychological literature seeks to free the self from substantive judgment, and place the soul in continuance with a backslide from reality by simplifying life`s understanding of eternal meanings to reading a book and except the courage to make real challenges to the implications of evil in the modern world.  However, Eckhart Tolle emphasizes \\"This, too, shall pass.\\"  And, in circumspect, with regard to the Christian scriptures, that delineate the meaning of Jesus' words and message, Tolle is not a prophet or a leader by religious standards, but his meanings are against the tenets of the Gospel: that there is a harsh prophecy of division in the world between good and evil, and the veil between the two will be arranged in sight of the Gospel.  In retrospect, visitation of chapter one indicates no annunciation of this division, in ethereal terms of enlightened division between good and evil.  After stating his assumption of the Gospel in starting his book,  four sentences later, Tolle writes, \\"Since human life and consciousness are intrinsically one with the life of the planet, as the old consciousness dissolves, there are bound to be synchronistic geographic and climatic natural upheavals in many parts of the planet, some of which we are already witnessing now.\\" (p.23).  With reference to my transcription of Luke, above, Tolle's book makes no delineation that Jesus will divide and judge the Earth with concord with the scriptures, and those reading this as Christian spiritual and redemptive literature are misled and will be deceived by Tolle's portrayal of \\"the new heaven and a new earth.\\"  The Gospel is clear in circumspect of the future in Luke, and the return of Jesus Christ in the final days, regarding Luke's thirteenth chapter, with this subchapter entitled, \\"The Narrow Door; Salvation and Rejection.\\"
0618526412|4.0|This is a great, though dark, story.  I read this as a college English assignment, and found it much more enjoyable than I expected.  The course was American Gothic, and though Gothic conjures up images of dark, dank, spooky and frightening, this story is one more of stifling futility.  It presents a good historical perspective on the thoughts and ideas of the 30's (the rise of Socialism).  Yet, it really does have a contemporary feel to it.  This is a worthwhile read.
B000024JCA|5.0|Originally purchased this album on vinyl in the 80's when I was living in the UK. Decided to buy it on CD for the first time and wasn't disappointed. An absolute classic recorded by a fantastic band. So glad there are now two versions of the band to enjoy who both seem to get on and still love belting out great music.
B001GKJ2FW|1.0|Listening to Pierce Brosnan (and to a lesser extent Meryl Streep) sing in this movie is an uncomfortable experience (especially in surround sound).  That being said, the daughter in this movie (played by Amanda Seyfried) has an outstanding voice, and as a relative unknown in the movie industry, she pretty much carried the entire movie on her shoulders (musically speaking).  Somebody however, forgot to tell the producers that this movie \\"is a MUSICAL!\\". So rather than attempt generate box-office revenues from the reputation of high profile actors with bad voices (Streep, Brosnan, Firth), they would have been better off casting actors who can actually act AND SING; doing so may have made this movie as enjoyable (and as profitable) as the stage play.      Sadly Mamma Mia is not worth watching, but if you must see it, rent -- don't purchase.

B0050XFY4O|4.0|I happened across this video on a lonely Sunday night at home and decided to download it. I was so impressed. The absolute beauty and elegance of it was such a pleasant surprise. The love story was beautiful and full of real passion and feeling. I think anyone would dream of being so lucky to have a  connection to someone on this intense of a level. I wasn't offended by the content or the nudity. It was what the movie needed to show the true passion of the relationship. I have recommended it to a few friends already. The ending was disappointing and the movie just seemed to stop without a real finish to it. Maybe an ending like that was in reality the perfect ending. Thanks to the film maker for giving us a look at unconventional true love.
B004VUP8WK|1.0|Illud Divinum Insanus is not only the worst Morbid Angel album, but perhaps the greatest disappointment in the death metal genre. This isn't a bad album for the techno influence alone. Actually I like industrial influences in metal. I like bands that incorporate those elements. I think it can work really well in death metal. But I don't like this.<br /><br />I could list all the bands that experimented at some point in their career. I could write down each one and list the reasons why their album from their 'new era' was a solid piece of work, but I won't. It would be a waste of time. I have had to deal with equally horrible albums by other bands, but there is a difference between my hearing St. Anger, Operation: Mindcrime 2, Crush, or The World Needs a Hero. I had long given up on those bands, and these discs only added more nails to their coffin. Illud Divinum Insanus is the first Morbid Angel disc that stinks from start to finish and severs any ties with the band's core sound.<br /><br />Maybe this disc wouldn't sound so bad if it wasn't a Morbid Angel record. It's just that their fans have obviously expected more from them being Morbid Angel with the return of a key member. However, the songs presented on this disc are terribly disappointing and as far removed from death metal as possible. And the songs that are supposed to be heavy are nothing but passable death metal. I literally cringe at the cliche riffing, the extremely formulaic writing, and the awful techno influences.<br /><br />The 'normal' tracks on the album sound like leftovers from their Domination sessions in that they exude a groovy vibe tied with the industrial elements found on Gateways and Heretic perhaps. The compositions are designed in a terribly predictable manner. There are so many stop-start sections in the songs it is not even funny. Each passage is filled with stop-and-go style riffing which sounds bland, weak, and lifeless itself. Moreover, they are littered with Vincent's squawking, which could make any prior fan feel suicidal.<br /><br />The other tracks are worse. They are like a cross between Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie -- in some of them the guitars are either entirely absent or inaudible. Clearly, the ultra-clean and bassy production does not help. On first listen, your whole attention will inadvertently be drawn to the boring 'thump, thump, thump' tone that permeates the pieces. The guitar sound is lost in the background, and the few times you hear it, it sounds puny and watery. What's worse, repeat listens only serve to bring out worse parts and more irritating details.<br /><br />When I first heard the lyrics, I thought this must be a joke and this cannot be the real album. Then, when I heard the line \\"This is your one warning,\\" I truly felt embarrassed for them. The track \\"I Am Morbid\\" should have been called \\"I Am Bored (Because I Can't Write Songs).\\" There is no build-up or tension in ANY of the songs. They all just plod along and end at random points without concluding with anything worth hearing. This is the reason why the track \\"Nevermore\\" stands out and sounds like a masterpiece -- because all the other songs are so poorly written and produced. Actually, \\"Nevermore\\" is a below average song itself -- and why does it sound exacly like another song on the CD, \\"Existo Vulgore?\\"<br /><br />If this had been released as a side project, it could have been excused. But releasing it under the Morbid Angel moniker and promoting it as the next big thing cause David Vincent is back in the band was a huge mistake. What's going to happen now? The band (and some fanbois) will defend the CD heartily and blame others for not 'getting' it. This will go on for quite some time, maybe until they've toured on it a great deal. Then, they will admit to Illud Divinum Insanus being an experiment that did not quite work, and we all should await their return-to-roots masterpiece. Yeah, right.<br /><br />Even as I type this, I am sickened. I never knew a death metal band could let its fans down like this.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Wow!  I just watched this entire DVD and I am blown away!  I probably have about 100 music DVD's but this one is very special.  The sound and picture are just excellent throughout and Eddie delivers a very intimate, great show.  I caught this tour in Albany, NY back in 2009 and enjoyed the show and hoped for a DVD and it's exceeded my expectations.  The DVD is probably more enjoyable than the show was as the concerts unfortunately drew in a ton of rowdy fans yelling through the whole show which admittedly sometimes is great fun, but these shows were for the most part acoustic and really deserved some quiet to hear the greatness.  The DVD takes care of this and you can really appreciate the great singing and playing Ed did for these shows.  The set list is great - \\"Into The Wild\\" is obviously featured heavily plus some great covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Cat Stevens.  Pick this up immediately - you will not be disappointed.  It appears I'm the ninth reviewer, so far no one has put less than 5 stars on this - for good reason!

1594202559|4.0|Mallaby is, without a doubt, a great writer.  He details the history of the hedge fund industry with a storyteller's flair and a practitioner's grasp of the technical details.  From its beginnings with Alfred Winslow Jones to its growth through giants like Soros, Robertson and Paul Tudor Jones to the role of funds during the recent crisis, Mallaby does a great job weaving together history with modern pratice to create an entertaining book.    The reason I don't give this book 5 stars is that Mallaby wants to make an argument about why hedge funds shouldn't be regulated in the last chapter. This argument ultimately falls flat, and I suspect Mallaby's too smart not to realize it.  He talks about how incentives at hedge funds are ultimately aligned properly, managers tie their own money into the funds, and the funds are rarely too big to fail.  The first part of the argument is only partially true, the second is theoretically but not entirely true, and the last is far from true.      Sure, funds don't get the kinds of golden parachutes for executives and liquidity support that Fed-regulated banks do.  On the other hand, fund managers take a commission based on the amount of assets under management (2% standard, but at plenty of funds it goes up to 3%) that gives managers an incentive to solicit more and more assets that could limit their clients' returns (which is a problem for a fiduciary).  Granted, more assets make it harder for funds to enter and exit positions quickly in a turbulent market, but there is still an incentive, at least on the margin, to accept more funds than is optimal to maximize returns.      Second, funds have been \\"too-big-to-fail\\" in the past, and can be so in the future.  Look at Long-Term Capital Management, which had to be bailed out when it imploded in 1998.  Granted, that bailout didn't cost taxpayers any money... but it's not hard to imagine government money being on the table if a big fund that trades with thousands of counterparties likea D.E. Shaw were to start teetering.  Last, Mallaby seems to assume that \\"sophisticated\\" investors will check to make sure that funds aren't being misused.  The Bernie Madoff saga seems to disprove this a priori.  Many of Madoff's \\"investors\\" were supposedly sophisticated \\"funds of funds\\" which were supposed to do due diligence on their managers.  The investors into these funds of funds, in turn, were largely unsophisticated.  Their failure to perform their duty seems to disprove Mallaby's argument about incentives.  Granted, Ponzi scehems are not the norm, and most funds almost certainly do thorough due diligence.  But the presence of swindlers and crooks in the market makes a strong case for the kind of regulation of the industry that Mallaby opposes.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I have to say I truthfully LOVE this movie. Although beware, if youre not like me, an avid and ravenous fan of 1970's and 1980's Grindhouse and exploitation cinema, you may not like this movie. Which unfortunately is why there are so many negative reviews. I'm not here to tell you whats good and whats not, youre entitled to your own opinion. But if you even like MAD MAX for its car scenes, or even older movies like Vanishing Point(which gets referenced in the movie often) for its car scenes you may just love this movie even if you dont like Horror or Gore exploitation. Also the second greatest star in this movie only to the GREAT Kurt Russell, is Zoe, the most badass and acrobatic girl in the movie. A great story of vengeance, but the ride to the end is the most fun.

0439023513|3.0|Before I read this book I glanced at the ratings and saw that this third installment had much lower reviews then the previous two installments of the Hunger Games Trilogy. I chalked it up that perhaps people simply didn't like the ending.  After reading Mockingjay I found myself surprised at how disjointed and uninteresting the third book was.  It simply doesn't work as well as the previous two. It's not as well written nor as creative.  The writing seemed rushed and a bit thoughtless. I only gave the book three stars because I simply loved the first two books and the characters and the world that Collins created.   The book is readable and moves along with a decent story it just doesn't keep pace with the other two. I wonder if Collins had given herself more time to write the final book if it would've came up better.  Not sure, but over all I enjoyed the series. The ending? Meh, again it seemed rushed and disjointed.   I'm definitely hungry and excited to see what they make of the movie.  I wonder how they will present this series in film version.  PG 13? It really should be an R rating because of the violence.  Also I think that a Premium Channel Tv Series would've better suited The Hunger Games series.  Hunger Games is definitely an interesting and unique read. Mockingjay for me, just didn't sing.
B004ZZITEU|2.0|I don't wanna trash Morbid Angel and I think they have major guts for putting this album out and respect that.  With that in mind, the techno-metal-industrial stuff just isn't my thing.  The 'standard' MA tracks like Beauty Meets Beast, Blades, Nevermore are very good songs....even the ultra-lame Radikult has a cool solo in it, I guess that's the redeeming part of that otherwise really horrible song.    I loved Gateways and Heretic.  I really still love those albums, and they were not terribly loved when they came out.  I think maybe this band has set the bar so high for themselves that it's hard to know where to go maybe?  I'm not making excuses for them, but they have done much better, and here's hoping they can get back to shredding and blasting out evil songs again because this album is awful.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I really did think this show sounded so dumb but my friend forced me to watch it...and I fell in love! I was so upset when I learned that it was cancelled. But beyond that, the series is great with fun characters and an interesting plot. I love how off River is and of course Mal's personality and relationship with his crew. I owned the series in regular DVDs but when the Blu-ray version went on sale I couldn't resist getting it.

B004XQO90O|5.0|I am a huge fan of Jake Gyllenhaal and so when I saw the previews for this movie I already knew this was definately a film I would be seeing, and still in the back of my mind I feared that this would be just another flop of the bang'em up, blow'em up films with little to no depth and a storyline that would be impossible to follow or just plain dull.  I am so very happy to say that this was a fantastic film that I look forward to adding to my collection. I also think that it is one of the more original films to come out to date. A few people stated that the film was predictable, I must be a little slow, because I was not expecting what happened.  I was excited by the ending, and while I was hoping it would end the way it did, I did not expect it.  I also didnt expect to see the soldier in the condition he was in, that was a shock... an emotional shock. This was an incredible movie because it managed to do what most people would think is impossible -repeat the same scene over and over again, and each time make that same scene more interesting, more suspensful that the previous. It got to the point where I was trying capture anything out of the ordinary in each re-run.  This film was engaging, fun, fast past and very well done.
B004Y03LQ2|1.0|Iron Maiden - The Goldman Sachs of metal    I understand the cost of jet fuel isn't getting any lower and probably neither is Smallwood's wine bill or Ger's ballet shoes and equipment, but isn't much of the world short of extra cash now? These cash bonuses go towards making Iron Maiden the Goldman Sachs of metal, the money eating termites, the paper money minting highwaymen with a boeing jet and a tired old setlist.     As in the case of the real banking firm's victims, Blaze found himself without a job and near penniless as his share went to Iron Goldman's executives. This is the disrespect shown Blaze, who helped provide us with the last musically interesting period. His songs are replaced with live mockeries featuring the powerless yelps and stubbed toe induced meaningless howls of Dickinson.     Here what we have is the Worst of Maiden, not only from the recent past (Dance of Death onwards) but the horrors of old in the form of Tail Gunner and other early 90s material. Maiden are now living up to their name of being an instrument of pure torture, wielded by that tormentor, the Witchfinder General for taste in music, Steve Harris the Terrible. He comes out galloping hard on the plains and waylays fanboys and listeners of the older better music, prises the money from their cold dead hands and instead presses a copy of this compilation into them, laughing as he makes his way back to his lair.     Let it be known that Iron Maiden are now OFFICIALLY INTOLERABLE.     The presence of No more lies, These colours, Dance of death, Different world, El Dorado, Coming Home and Tail Gunner can only make this compilation an atrocity exhibition.     The reign of terror that began 8 years ago with Dance of Death is an evil that lives on and on ...     Maiden now roughly have 12 compilations and live albums together which is like the average discography for two bands together. If there is another great fear generated by this, it's that another live album can't be far behind. Followed by another compilation.     Guard your wallets! Harris rides again tonight!
B000002OOY|5.0|I watched this film the other day and I was blown away by the film score. I've listened to this movie score for years but hearing it again in the context of the film made me realize what a complete masterpiece this is. The themes and sounds are completely iconic and in my opinion, this score is one of the best scores of the 1990s. An absolute treasure and a must own for every film score collector! Additionally, I would like to put in a plug for the second score \\"Jurassic Park: The Lost World\\". The film is completely inferior to the first, but Williams creates a very different yet enthralling sound for the sequel. Both scores are amazing!
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|This adapter worked great with my TV for a little while, and then it started to get spotty, and now I can't get it to connect at all. This happened with my last adapter too -- I think I might give up on HDMI and get an RGB or Composite adapter - they seem much more reliable.     I've had a MiniDisplay to DVI adapter from Apple that has worked fantastic for almost 2 years -- I don't know why the HDMI adapters keep breaking!!  If you check Apple forums there are tons of people complaining about this problem.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I thought this movie was fabulous and engaging from start to finish. The openning scene was just heartwrenching, I couldnt help but to feel terribly sorry for the (then) Prince. His struggles were just incredible and then to be suddenly throne into the seat of power with everything going on just filled this movie with the powerful emotion, story and then combined with the acting talents of Collin Firth, Geoffery Rush, Guy Pierce and Helena Bonham-Carter, it is no wonder this film won Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Best Picture.  My brother didnt like the movie, he said it was too slow for him, but I explained to him that you really had to listen and pay attention to get a feel of what he was going through (my brother is the type of person that text messages during movies). He didnt even know what traumas took place in the Prince's life that gave him the speech issue in the first place and that alone is enough to bring you to tears.  The relationship between Firth and Rush was great and led to a powerful ending that made this one of the Best Movies of the year.  I highly recommend this movie and insist that you shut the door, turn out the lights and eliminate all destraction while watching. There is an emotion to the film that is delicate but moving if you let it.

B0054EZ6JM|5.0|Great ending to the Rebel Flesh!  The switch between Doctors was a neat way to show up prejudices!  It was also great how the Doctor was all unwittingly told his future!  We knew, from the Silence, that this would happen, but not how or why.  And then the unveiling of the reason why Amy keeps seeing the woman with the patch and why the Doctor's scans keep signaling that she is both pregnant and not pregnant!  Wow!  That moment when he says that she hasn't been there for a long, long time....still gives me chills!!!  I'm looking forward to reviewing the last episode in this half of the season.  I've already seen it multiple times but I want to wait---I cry every time I see it, though!  As a long time Doctor Who fan (25 years of faithful watching) I have to say that I am enjoying this season and this Doctor more than any other!  That's just me, of course :-)

B002T9H2L0|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The video quality was very good, but I didn't see it as great.  I thought the video was soft.  I had my TV set to \\"Vivid\\", and it still did not look great.  There wasn't any grain, but it just did not look sharp.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was great - lot's of surround sound.<br /><br />I thought the movie was pretty good.  It looked like it was 2.40:1, and lasted about 2 hours and thirty minutes.  There were a lot of sub-titles, and it did not give me enough time to read some of them.  I just don't like having to read the words; it distracts from the movie.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Critics overlook the better movies sometimes, and Sucker Punch is one such case.  Since the story line revolves around going in and out of the head, of course it's gonna seem a bit jumbled and disoriented.  However, when you finally realize this entire movie consists of the character's imagination the movie becomes that much more interesting.<br /><br />Over-the-top maybe, but never over the limit.  The Blu-ray Extended Cut is definitely a lock for me.
B000Y9Q59W|3.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews, I expected an awful picture.  Video quality varied in this movie, some of it being poor, and some being pretty good.  There is a lot of grain in some scenes.  On a 10 point scale, I give it a range between 4.5 and 8.0 (I have never rated a Blu-Ray less than 4.0).  It wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy the movie.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio was very good, but the surround sounds were subtle (but this was okay for a non-action movie).<br /><br />The movie was pretty good, not great.  I had to watch this before watching the new Wall Street movie.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|To people on both sides--whether you're Christian, Atheist, or something in between--I don't care, this movie's funny, and if you don't think so you need your sense of humor re-calibrated.<br /><br />This sci-fi comedy stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as two British nerds, ready to take a road trip of all the infamous UFO sites in Western America.  Along the way, they witness a strange accident and up from the wreckage comes... Paul, a talking alien voiced by Seth Rogen, who decides to tag along for the road trip until Paul's able to get back.<br /><br />As far as the whole \\"christian portrayal\\" is concerned, people on both sides really need to keep their pants on.  Christians argue that the film is TOTALLY CORRUPT because of the zealous Christian portrayal, which I find to be ludicrous because at the end of the day IT'S JUST A MOVIE!  Atheists tend to use this scene to \\"push logic forward.\\"  Once again, at the end of the day it's just a movie.  Despite his Darwinistic approach and the anti-God talk, the character of Paul still stands firm with people \\"believing what they want to believe,\\" a.k.a. having faith.<br /><br />Long story short... if you lack a sense of humor and/or a backbone, avoid this movie.  Otherwise, enjoy!
1932100660|5.0|I teach college technical/business writing that includes how to conduct and evaluate research. This book contains the most comprehensive and solid research on ANY subject I have ever read. After researching their studies and understanding the research's validity, I was able to fully comprehend the profound implications of this book.    ALL HUMANS NEED TO READ THIS BOOK!! The cover of the book is so misleading and does such a disservice to the importance of the findings and conclusions reached in the text. This is not about weight loss or diet. This book explains, in scientific and layman's details, how important our diet (the English language really needs different words for things like 'diet', 'fat', 'protein', etc.!) is to our health.     I was shocked at how extensive the research was in this book for food controlling obesity, heart disease, and even cancer and autoimmune diseases. You read that correctly! Eat right and control your weight...that is obvious! Eat right and avoid or even reverse cancer? That seems crazy and I was extraordinarily skeptical! But this book shows the undeniable research. It's there. It can't be ignored. And it has changed my life.
B00013BN4S|5.0|Been a fan of Emmylou's work from way back when. I had the privilege of seeing her perform in Washington, DC many, many times. I would go see her practically every week at a small club venue called The Childe Harold. I remember one evening walking from my car, to the club with some friend's, and who should be coming toward us but none other than Emmylou. I'll never forget her greeting to us...How are you boys this evening? It was spoken songfully in that lilting, gorgeous voice, we were kinda' dumbstruck.<br /><br />Anyway, enough reminiscing, buy this album, beautiful music, you won't regret it.
B0041KKYBA|1.0|How do you do a film on what caused the 2nd Great Depression and not point a finger at the Federal Reserve, a group of the biggest banks you've all heard of by their various names?  How do you not point to government policies encouraging loaning money to people who you'd know, if you actually LOOKED at their finances, couldn't pay when times got tough?  How do you not point to the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the failures?  How do you take the words of criminals such as Eliot Spitzer and Barney Frank, the latter who obviously manipulated much of this?  This film smelled of an immature and deliberately limited approach of \\"greed is bad,\\" complete with hookers and blow.<br /><br />This failed to show how government manipulation made problems WORSE, and instead tried to blame everything on \\"deregulation.\\"  The editing was also very sneaky.  At several points, the interviewer of people who were admittedly thugs asked a question or made a snide comment, then the interview was cut away from, so that the response, if any, was skipped.  I agree that said thugs were contributors to the problem, but the aim seemed to be to pretend that they were the whole problem, and regulation was the cure.  To pitch that is to ignore all the government-sponsored rip-offs that occurred between 1933 and 1980 (for more complete info, read Joe Plummer's \\"Dishonest Money.\\")<br /><br />Frankly, I agree with 80% of what this film had to say.  Unfortunately, it misses or ignores the most important 20% I've tried to address above, and uses some fairly typical anti-market propaganda to cloak the obvious truth: the government hand washes the bankers hand, and the bankers hand washes the government bureaucrats and politicians hand.  This is the REAL story of the failure of republic.  You cannot expect governments to protect you from the \\"evil bankers.\\"  The government will coddle them and help them screw you every time.  The only chance you have against the \\"evil bankers\\" is a truly free market, in which those bankers cannot use the violence of the state to manipulate you.  It's no accident that the two great depressions, all the greatest wars and violence, and the blessings of modernity stolen from us have all happened since the institution of the US Federal Reserve system.  THAT is the real story.ket, in which those bankers cannot use the violence of the state to manipulate you.

I thought Jake G. and Anne Hathoway made interesting characters and u get to see them both partially nude. U get 2 c Jake G's bootie several times and he does have a somewhat hot body.

B004Q9T4E4|3.0|It is telling that the first six reviews of this book fell evenly into the extremes of either \\"4 and 5 stars\\" or \\"1 and 2 stars\\". Apparently, with Ferguson it is either love or hate, not a lot of room for balanced analysis.    The book is indeed an enjoyable read, but it is so biased that it hurts... If you happen to suffer from the same biased views, of course, you will certainly love the book. If you don't suffer from the same bias, it is very easy to hate Ferguson and his arrogant attitude. This in spite of his ability to write text which is easy to read and quite enjoyable.    Ferguson writes from a clearly Anglo-Saxon perspective: he values competition, performance, individualism, the exact sciences (as opposed to humanistic science), protestant religion rather than catholicism, and the Anglo-Saxon style of democracy (which can be very different from other successful democracies found in other parts of the world).    If Ferguson would read Geert Hofstede's works on culture, perhaps he would realize just how biased his views are... And it might be interesting to debate whether Anglo-Saxon values, which indeed dominated the world in the past 200 years, will continue to be dominant in the next 200 years. Or is it possible that a different set of values will be more closely linked to a multi-lateral world, rendering Ferguson's six \\"apps\\" obsolete? Could it be that other cultures will dominate from now on, not because they are learning to use Ferguson's \\"six apps\\", but rather because they have different \\"apps\\" which will prove to be better fit for survival in the 21st Century?    I do suspect, however, that Ferguson is not likely to enjoy learning how to use different \\"apps\\"... He seems to be fixated on 19th Century ideas instead.

B004XIQIPQ|1.0|It's amazing that the Arctic Monkeys are still a band.  For the second release in a row, the music is a forgettable backdrop to more crooning from Alex Turner.  And what makes it even worse is that when you then have to focus on the lyrics you can't help to think \\"Trite.\\"  After the Arctic Monkeys produced a fabulous debut and a solid followup--full of memorable songs and sharp social observation--we now have two releases in a row lacking a single memorable song in the lot--the band sounds like they are musically sleepwalking and the lyrics--well to put it nicely, there just isn't much depth.  No sense in waiting for the third strike--they're done. I'll content myself with the first two releases and be happy to forget the rest.  I'll just pretend they broke up after their second album, because this band does not resemble that band in any shape or form...
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|The Arctic Monkeys rose to prominence with a style of music that was fairly upbeat, lively and more rock orientated and with each new album they move further away from their early template, shedding fans with each new release along the way.<br /><br />With the band's previous album, Humbug, the music became more difficult and experimental, with production duties being handled in part by legendary QOTSA/Kyuss musician Josh Homme.<br /><br />For fans who were very turned off by Humbug, this latest album, Suck It And See is not the glorious return to the style of their debut album that you may be hoping for.<br /><br />The musical direction suggested by excellent single `Don't Sit Down `Cause I Moved Your Chair,' and the drummer-singing pre-release track `Brick By Brick,' may have been misleading as the overall tone is less rock orientated than previous Arctic Monkeys material.<br /><br />The album rather, is a mixture of the slower, more ballad style material such as Alex's solo work and Arctic Monkeys works like the B Side `The Bakery,' or `505,' from Favourite Worst Nightmare, with the experimental style found on Humbug (here especially on tracks such as the weird `Library Pictures,' and on `All My Own Stunts' where Josh Homme makes his fifth guest vocal appearance with the band)<br /><br />Cleaner, more acoustic or quiet tracks such as `Reckless Serenade,' and `The Hellcat Spangled Shalalala,' form the majority of the album and there is even a reworking of Alex's solo ballad from the Submarine EP `Piledriver Waltz.'<br /><br />Ignoring musical direction however, the album is very strong, with a diverse and musically interesting set of songs with the same vocal and lyrical style and quality you can always find in Arctic Monkeys music.<br /><br />Overall, this album is worth checking out if you are a fan of everything the band do, and are happy with their progression and shifts in direction over the years, but I would not recommend it to fans who vastly prefer the style found on Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not because this album is perhaps the polar opposite of that album, where a consistent set of sharp and direct songs are replaced with either subtle and ponderous or just downright weird ones.t because this album is perhaps the polar opposite of that album, where a consistent set of sharp and direct songs are replaced with either subtle and ponderous or just downright weird ones.
B004EPYZOO|2.0|Nic Cage's career has been one heck of a roller-coaster ride. From highs so high, you'd think he was worthy of a place among Hollywood's leading men legends, to lows so low, that you wonder if his agent is out to sabotage him to never working in film again, his film credits have run the gamut. In the grand scheme of all that, &#34;Drive Angry,&#34; while not the lowest point he's ever hit, certainly is on that end of the dividing line.<br /><br />Cage plays a man named Milton, who's come back from the depths of Hell, to revenge his daughter's murder and grand-daughter's kidnapping at the hands of Jonah King (played by Billy Burke) and his devil cult. All while picking up a sexy sidekick (played by Amber Heard) and dodging a hell-born truant officer (played by William Fichtner).<br /><br />If that plot sounds completely preposterous, that's only because it is. The film is on the level of a low-budget grindhouse affair, but is lacking in the true grit and feeling of sleaziness that a true one would have. Cage spends the entire film with the same expression on his face, whether he's blowing people away, talking about his love for his daughter, or getting it on with a cheap floozy. Meanwhile, Billy Burke's character is simply evil incarnate, without a single redeeming factor or any complexity of any kind. He doesn't just lack depth of character, but shallowness of character. Amber Heard is simply some very sexy arm candy for Cage, as the plot shows her to be little more than the perpetual damsel in distress, even when she's trying to kick some ass herself. The only one to bring anything of value to this proceeding, is William Fichtner as the hellspawn retriever known as &#34;the Accountant.&#34; His deadpan expressions and flippant remarks make up most of the humor to be found (which isn't much) in this action-paced mess.<br /><br />Co-Writer/Director Patrick Lussier, who's resume includes such cinematic gems like &#34;Dracula 2000,&#34; &#34;The Prophecy 3&#34; and &#34;White Noise 2&#34; opts to leave out such unnecessary trivialities, like a coherent plot, character motivations and explanations, and emotional drama, to give more time to the much more important special effects, action sequences, and 3-D elements. Why create a mood, when you can simply blow things up?<br /><br />Pretty much everything else is just explosions, car chases, and blood-letting. Some of which is fairly well done and the one sole area the film tries to excel at. We get no real insights into Cage's or Heard's characters. The script has Cage telling us how much he loved his daughter and how Heard was &#34;waiting for something&#34; in her life, but it's never really bought to life in the film. There is absolutely zero emotional investment in any of these characters. Even in the most shoot-'em-up action-fest around, you need to make folks care about what happens to the hero. Such is never the case here, because to do that would take time away from blasting people with shotguns and watching cars race down the highway. Despite it's R-rating, the film actually feels like it's aimed to appeal to boys between 12-16 years-old, which is only fitting as the film is on the same maturity level.<br /><br />In the end, &#34;Drive Angry&#34; is an empty barrel, as the amount of noise made during the viewing should no doubt tell you. It hits one-note throughout its 104 minute run time and never even tries to go beyond it. I could almost believe they wanted to make a grindhouse film, except the budget for the action and special effects goes against that, as well as going after a star of Nic Cage's level (although, with films like this to his credits, that might start to change). It's too &#34;shiny&#34; to be a grindhouse film, but too poorly conceived to be a true Hollywood action blockbuster. I suppose if you had a couple hours to kill and were looking for a totally mindless experience, you could do worse than this film. But for the action junkies out there, you have many other offerings that will fill your need for carnage, and are better made films, than this one is. It's really only one to see, when you've seen most everything else this film genre has to offer.any other offerings that will fill your need for carnage, and are better made films, than this one is.

0143116177|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone who could benefit from learning about money and the financial system, which in today's world should be nearly everyone.     If you have a background in finance or economics this will be a valuable book. Indeed while reading the numerous descriptions of past financial crisis I couldn't help but wonder if an earlier publication date could have done anything to lessen the latest one. Probably not. But still, if I was calling the shots at a bank or hedge fund I might make this required reading.    The \\"layman\\" has just as much to gain. Today's financial system has become so complex that I think we often become confused about what money really is. Hunter-gatherers with sea-shell currencies probably understand money better than we do. More than giving a history, Ferguson gives a definition of banking, bonds, equities, insurance, housing markets and global trade by detailing their roots. In the process he answers the question \\"what is money?\\"     It's not the most riveting book on my shelf, but Ferguson does a good job with a subject that can be devastatingly dull in the wrong hands. Stick with it if it comes slowly at first. I found that each chapter was better than the one before and by the end I was enjoying as much as I was learning. I was particularly impressed with the portions of the last chapter where he compares the world on the eve of the first world war, \\"the first age of globalization\\", with the globalizing world of today.
0345529057|3.0|I am enjoying the content of material immensely, was fascinated by the HBO series so I had to get the books and the price was perfect.  On the downside My book 2 A Clash of Kings is a horrible printed version.  Ink on the pages bled and are smudged on page 648,657,680,681,688,689,704,and 712. These books while \\"new\\" , seem like publisher rejects, with little flaws here and there, most can be over looked, although if i would have known about the flaws i might have passed on the boxed set despite the price.     I hope book 3 and 4 are in better shape.

He got it for his birthday, his aunt always gets him a duplo set at each holiday which is a fun tradition. :) This set is definately the best set he has. :)
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I've been a long-time fan of Francine Jay and her blog Miss Minimalist. When I found out she had a new kindle out for only 99 cents I hopped on it.<br /><br />This kindle download is a compilation of 50 articles that are also available on her blog. If they're free on her blog, why did I spend a buck to buy them? Because I wanted the ease and convenience of having them at my fingertips. Now whether or not I'm connected to the internet I can get a dose of Francine's gentle inspiration any time I want it.<br /><br />What's inside: It looks like Francine chose some of her heaviest-hitters for this Kindle download. There are the nitty-gritty action step articles for how to deal with clothes, shoes, kitchen clutter, etc. And then there are some exquisite nspirational pieces scattered in for seasoning that cover the more intrinsic aspects of living a happy, simplified life.<br /><br />IMO you can't beat this bundle of articles for a buck. Yep, you can also go to her blog and read em' for free, but I love the easy access of having them in Kindle.
0061122416|3.0|A Good book and a Good Read. Seems to cut off for the ending as it leaves out the rest of the story. Not as inspiring as I had expected but overall a good book.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I'm waiting for my third Epic as I write this.  The first two had defects that made them unplayable, which is sad because I'm a big fan of the Rookie and Standard balls and I've been waiting for this one for awhile.  The Perplexuses are great games and I would fully give this a 5 across the board if the quality control on these things was a little better. :(    The first Epic had a misaligned section of the maze that offset several key points, making them almost impossible.  Eventually I realized it WAS impossible at a point because the ball didn't have room to go under an obstacle.  Returned it.  Amazon sent another.    Second Epic looked good, but on closer inspection the piece that the gondola slides along has a spur in the plastic that won't allow the gondola to slide all the way across to the other side.  Returned it.  Amazon sent another.    Update: The third Perplexus is defect-free, I'm happy to report.  It was almost a game in itself trying to get one that wasn't defective.  I'm glad that Amazon makes returning and exchanging items easy.
B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Where do I start? Let me start with the ugly, jarring harsh makeup. What happened to SJP's lovely face? It looked like her original face was made of latex and then melted over a gas stove and stretched. Sweetheart--you're too OLD to have long dark two-toned hair. You're also too old to be that thin. SJP had the sex appeal of a dried-out stalk of wheat in this movie. Her character, Carrie, is unrecognizable now. The imperfect bubbly cute Carrie has been replaced by this humorless stretched out elitest shrew. She's the kind of woman now that Carrie would not have liked in the series. She's awful to everyone in the movie--condescending to the other characters. In fact, all of them are incredibly rude to \\"lesser\\" people--servents, foreigners (they're only foreigners after all!).<br /><br />Worst things (for me):<br />-Samantha's wardrobe. WHY do they insist dressing Kim Cattrall like a bad drag queen version of Joan Crawford? She has a lovely figure and they always stick her in these ridiculous hard-edged power suits with enormous shoulder pads.<br /><br />-Samantha also got the honor of saying the worst line of the movie \\"Lawrence of my labiaaaa!\\" which was embarrassing to witness<br /><br />-Miranda was tolerable, except when she lowered the window of the car in the desert, screeching like she was at a sports bar at the goat herders at the side of the road--just culturally tin-eared and disrespectful and they seemed to rush to herd back the goats who were startled, glaring at this over-privileged moron in a $400,000 Mercedes<br /><br />-Charlotte gets camel toe. Oh goody. More vulva jokes! Really? Does Charlotte have to be humiliated in some scatalogical way now in every movie? The spoiled entitled American idiocy of her holding out her phone yelling about reception on top of the camel was also atrocious. Again, completely disrespectful and something Charlotte of old would NEVER have done<br /><br />-Carrie's prudish covering up of Samantha at every turn, but she shows up to meet Aiden (after hilariously kohling her squinty tired-looking eyes to even smaller proportions) in a thigh-baring cleavage-revealing top and skirt.<br /><br />-Mr. Big, the true virile man's man, posing like a ponce-y English Noel Coward in brown satin pajamas holding a teeny tiny teacup and saucer.<br /><br />-They ask Samantha what she's eating, even though most normal people, and particularly supposedly sophisticated people from New York City have known what HUMMUS is since like 1991.<br /><br />I was a huge SATC fan, and I enjoyed the first movie, but this movie was the kind of irritating where you want to kick something or drink.

0763644765|5.0|I bought several potty books for my 21 month old in preparation for potty training.  I thought for sure that the Elmo book would be the favorite, but this is the only one she has any interest in!  She didn't even show any interest in the potty that had been in our bathroom for months until we read this book together.  Now she sits on the potty and reads this book and loves it! Thanks so much!
B001UV4XHY|2.0|i usually enjoy harry potter movies and have them all but, this DVD was irritating because it is so darkly lit.  i realize that night time scenes are suppose to be \\"dark-ER\\" for effect but, many of the scenes were not viewable due to poor lighting design and/or transfer quality (mentioned by reviewer: Ryan Rogers).  i simply do not see the point in having it SOOOO dark that one can not enjoy the great acting, awesome special effects, and fascinating story line.  my monitor (tv) is new & i did turn my brightness and contrast controls to maximum, to no avail :-(
B004LWZWE2|5.0|I don't know what took so long to put this on DVD but it's about time! This is the great early stuff. Just a killer bare bones rock-n-roll show filmed in a way that wont send you into an epileptic seizure, I'm so glad I can finally get rid of my very well worn VHS.

B004H83IFA|3.0|`All good things `is a story which would be a constant fodder for the tabloids and the likes of Nancy Grace. The story is about a rich boy, his problematic childhood and subsequent problems. It is also a murder mystery about the disappearance of his wife, whose whereabouts are still unknown almost thirty years after.<br />Sanford Marks (Frank Langella) is a prominent real estate developer who owns several prime properties in NYC. He has two sons, one of them is David Marks (Ryan Gosling), who is expected to join the fathers business but is not interested in it. Damaged and devastated since he accidently witnessed his mothers' suicide many years ago, he seeks life away from the family wealth and finds it in the arms of Katie Marks (Kirsten Dunst). His father displeased eventually agrees to this match and the newlywed couple settles down in Vermont operating a small home goods store. Circumstances however force David to rejoin his father's business and this begins his downward spiral, resulting in the disappearance of his wife and his eventual life as a fugitive posing as a woman in Galveston, Texas.<br />The movie is inspired from the real life story of Robert Durst and this is the films uniqueness. The real life events have been fictionalized and presented in a lively manner. All the actors are top notch, Ryan Gosling excels in another unconventional role and Frank Langella is the evil dad avatar. Kirsten Dunst is the real revelation as she plays the part of a smart but ultimately gullible woman unable to fit in to a world that she does not belong. She conveys the anguish and the destruction of her dreams with such finesse that you begin to sympathize with her. Hers is the best written role. \\"All Good Things\\" is definitely great in parts and is appealing because they have a ring of truth which probably occurred. I liked it mostly because of the well known cast and some great acting. Three stars. 6/6/2011
B0007KVAVG|5.0|Great album at a great price. I saw the Angel of Retribution Tour in 2005 and it was awesome.  I recommend this album highly, as it's a favorite.
B004L49K20|4.0|This album is very good. I have been playing it a lot lately. It is not as predictable as the Notorious Album. It is a whole lot better that the Notorios album. This album has a story behind it. My favorite songs on the Album is Leave a Light on and Mediteranea. I like those songs. My personal favorites. It Like the greatest hits album, and I still play it from time to time. They have been my favorite group for 18 years.

0525951652|4.0|This is the way one should learn History. Ken Follett has written a fictional historical novel based on well researched facts of WWI. When I first saw the size of the book, (985 pages), and the cast of characters, (fictional and real), involving five countries worldwide, I was overwhelmed. I wondered how I would ever remember them all and keep everyone straight. Follett writes with a gripping storyline that keeps the story moving and easy to absorb.    The book begins on July 22,1911 and ends in January 1924. We learn how the war started and how the countries were all drawn into to defend and protect themselves and their allies. From Britain, to Germany, Austria, Poland, France, Russia and the Russian Revolution, to the imminent involvement of the United States, we are taken on a journey through the lives and families of those who fought in the war and those who kept the home fires burning.    The fictional characters provide for a better understanding of the human side of the war and of course make for a more interesting read than a nonfiction dry book. Whatever problems you may find with the characters, the teach you what it was like to live in that time of our history and how governments deal with war.
B002ZG98J6|2.0|If you liked the book, don't see the movie. The main storyline is missing, the stars far too old for 12 year old Percy, and the attempt to appeal to older teens makes it a bad view for all of us.
B004V9J21O|4.0|Testimony is now complete. Time to move on , Neal. A lot of the lyrical and musical passages were \\"borrowed\\" from T1 and other Spock's works (Snow etc.)I agree with most of the previous reviews. Neal continues to produce some of the BEST prog to date, and is a brilliant musician and songwriter- he just needs to possibly take a break from his 2 hour CD's and 3 hour concerts and come up with some FRESH , NEW material....\\"Seeds of Gold\\" and \\"Mercy Street\\" (I and II) are great. Can't wait for Neal to move in a NEW direction.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|An important work--it really opened my eyes to the business of food. Not heavy handed, it brings facts and for the most part allows viewers to draw their own conclusions. Particularly interesting was the level to which big (food) business individuals wind up in government, making key policy decisions that affect us all. I left determined to be deliberate about the food choices I make for myself and my family.
0141023570|4.0|This is an easy classic to knock off the list in two hours. Like many people I saw the movie first, though a good 15 years prior. I'll admit John Malkovich popped in my head many times, but I was able to form my own images also. It's amazing how even a simple and short story can can draw you in so deeply. It was easy to smell the country air, and visualize the ranch. I suspect this book is disliked by some, and removed from a few libraries because the \\"N\\" word is dropped many times. But hey, that's a sign of the times. Great book overall. Quite moving at the end.
B00246VKFM|4.0|Outstanding movie which my 6th graders really liked. I also used the bonus features to launch lessons on propaganda and Holocaust art. One niggling \\"complaint.\\" Unless I couldn't figure out how to get subtitles, my choices were dubbed English and Italian (no subtitles). I would have liked to have the option of having kids watch a movie in its original language with the subtitles (the way I saw it in the theater). We got past the mismatched mouth and words pretty quickly, but I still think it loses a little of the manic style.

B0010SKUYM|2.0|I had just finished the 1st four books of the Song of Fire and Ice series and Amazon recommended this one to me. I read reviews of the book and others like it and decided to try it (Kindle edition). It just drags. It is a neat concept but the writing is just not exciting at all. I made it into chapter 11 and finally gave up! Maybe it gets better later but I not going to waste anymore time with the book. I'll just wait for book 5 of the Song of Fire and Ice.
B004K4IZ54|1.0|If your thinking of spending $30 so you can watch this in 3D I'd save your money.  Maybe it's because I'm not a BIG 3D fan but I found the 3D version of this movie to not be worth the cost.  I liked the move but would go for the cheaper 2d version.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Overall I have been enjoying this knife. It has a solid weight to it and performs well in many tasks. I have been batoning, chopping and skinning with it for weeks and have seen very little wear. About the only thing that I do not like is the handle. It does not provide a good grip so I will be making modifications to fix this as I like the knife.
0061537969|5.0|I am an avid reader, yet rarely reread a book.  This is the ONLY book I have ever read and immediately turned around and read it again.  I have purchased 5 copies of this book as gifts for my daughter and favorite friends/relatives.  I will keep this book forever.  There are some books that make your life richer.  This is definitely one of them!  Read Chapter 18 before you begin the book.
B00533CLE2|5.0|I couldn't wait for this album to come out (I'm old, I still call them albums and records). On its own merits it is an excellent album with a slight problem with the mix on the  horns from time to time, very minor. I never thought I would say this: there's too much mellow Susan Tedeschi on this effort; and way too little of DTB influence. I found it odd that the first selection that really grabbed me was #10, entitled \\"Shrimp and Grits interlude\\". It is the first time the Derek Trucks influence show. The final two tracks are more of what I expected. Soooo, if you are a fan of Susan's (and I am), most of this record with thrill you. If you are a fan of Derek's band and DT, it's a bit of a disappointment. So, it goes like this: great Susan Tedeschi mellow tracks (1-9) and great real mix of the two bands (tracks 10-12). Oh, and there is a secret track. When the last track, \\"Shelter,\\" ends, there is about a 15 or so second blank space and then there is another four minutes of what you might have expected instrumentally.<br />Again, based on my expectations (three to 4 stars, on its own 5 stars.<br />Finally, if you want to know what this could have been, dig way back to 1969-70, find Cold Blood's first two albums (they are packaged together now) and you will have a sense of what I expected.<br />There are some mysteries here as well. The album is called \\"Revelator\\" but they don't cover that song. They need to have a long talk with Taj Mahal and Gillian Welch about that. Second mystery, they do a song called \\"Ball and Chain\\", that is apparently a new composition and has nothing to do with the Big Mama Thornton classic covered so well by the late, great Janis Joplin.<br />Overall, I'd say but it. the disc is great music, but be forewarned, if you are a fan of either or both of these artists and their bands individually, prepared to be surprised. I found a few listens to be quite helpful.
1401923119|5.0|This book is actually really well written and filled with valid science.  While I didn't agree with every conclusion drawn, the core idea was sound.  The book is written so that anyone might understand it, which makes it good for sharing, but honestly, I would have preferred standard scientific language.  I did appreciate all of the citations!  I highly recommend it, whether to enhance one's own scientific philosophy or just to consider something outside the box.  It's sort of an armchair survey of epigenetics with theory applied to many areas of life.
0553381695|5.0|A completely imaginary conversation:<br /><br />Fantasy Author X: In my novel, I have a girl pretending to be a boy.  She's travelling with a large group of men and boys...<br />George:  Great.  What about when she has to take a leak?<br />X (aghast): W-what?<br />George: She's gonna have to go at least once a day. ***very minor spoiler- Someone's bound to notice sooner or later.  -end spoiler***<br />--<br />X: In my novel, men and women are equal...<br />George: Not gonna happen.  Look, your basic fantasy novel is typically set in a world similar to mideval Europe.  Unless your women have some sort of magical advantage over men, the most logical assumption is that they would have the same social status as they did in our world.<br />--<br />X: I've got dragons...<br />George: It'll never fly.<br />X (infuriated by this point): What's your problem now?<br />George: It'll never fly looking like that.  For a dragon as huge as you're looking at to be able to fly, it would have to be mostly wing.<br />X: It's a magical creature!  It doesn't have to follow the laws of physics!<br />George: If it flies by magic, why put wings on it at all?<br />X (exasperated): B-because it would look stupid without wings.<br />George:  Well, yeah.  And it looks stupid with wings too small to actually work.<br />X: AAAAH!<br /><br />Moral: Just because it's a fantasy novel, that doesn't mean it has to be completely out of touch with reality.<br /><br />Warning: This series is incomplete.  May cause Martin Derangement Syndrome in people with high impatience.  Pregnant women should probably skip the sex and violence bits.
B004ZZITEU|5.0|Edit: removed inflammatory language, so review might actually be read.     Ok, when I first heard Radikult, I almost spit my drink across the room, but after hearing the whole album, the song is a small, fun part of a killer MA album. Morbid Angel has helped define the sound of death metal and while the rest of the world is still trying to be them, they're already 10 pages ahead. People are used to hearing the same rip-offs of Morbid Angel, Pantera, and Metallica over and over again from new bands. Morbid Angel are evolving and once again showing the world the kind of creativity that real talented inspired musicians are capable of.     Listen to the whole album. You'll have no doubt that MA are still the masters of death metal. I actually respect Morbid Angel for putting Radikult on the album. Plus, in the context of the album it doesn't even seem as shocking as when listened to out of context.     I guess what it comes down to is this: Morbid Angel are brilliant musicians who know what they're doing.  So let them have some fun and give them the benefit of the doubt if you're a real fan. It's truly creative and ground breaking IMO. Listen to it with an open mind and don't expect something from the 80's.    I have to wonder if all the people writing these negative reviews are listening to the same thing as me or if they've even heard the album. The song Radikult is completely different than everything else on there and it somehow fits while standing out. It just seems to me that there's a lot of knee jerk reactions from people who haven't given the album a chance. Give it a listen or two and decide for yourself.     Honestly, I just want to support Morbid Angel right now. I think once the shock of that one song wears off, this album will get better reviews, but today especially I felt I should say something. But if you end up not liking it, that's fine with me. Just actually listen to it and give it a chance before dismissing it based on these reviews.
0316056863|5.0|I have been a Fey fan for years so it was only natural that I would read her book almost immediately. This book is classic Fey, her sarcastic wit throughout the book as she discusses her life with family, friends, and work. I loved this book, and was often caught laughing hysterically (out loud) as I read it. The only problem I had was that the graphics on the kindle were a little difficult to understand but I may just be an idiot.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|Movie is already great. Ordered early for part of a Father's Day gift and it came SUPER fast! Almost opened the box in front of the hubby since I didn't put two and two together (ordered a few diff things at the same time) THANKS for the SUPER fast shipping Amazon!
0316056863|5.0|Loved this book. Not an autobiography, but Fey chooses to share select stories about growing up, holding strange jobs, and her surprising rise into stardom. Her view of the world is beautiful and inspiring as well as hilarious. She's a wonderful role model for women everywhere, especially those in business.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|Not since 2003 have we been graced with a truly good X-Men movie, but it seems the curse of the Wolverine has been lifted, for X-Men: First Class is a film that has evolved beyond its ancestors, a film that is equal parts entertaining and compelling, that portrays relatable, human (technically non-human) characters while still placing the fate of the world in their hands. Somehow, amidst a profusion of by-the-numbers superhero movies, a mutant has been born, and its power far exceeds that of the average cinematic experience.<br /><br />One of the main reasons this film succeeds is because the CGI battles take a back seat to more poignant scenes about mutants grappling with their place in the world. The villain Shaw (Kevin Bacon) believes humans and mutants will never be able to coexist, and since his power allows him to absorb energy, he attempts to provoke Russia and America into nuclear war. In one fell swoop, the war will wipe out a huge percentage of humanity and at the same time provide Shaw with nearly limitless power. The backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis is a parallel that casts a thought-provoking light on the difficulty of coexistence. For once, an X-Men movie's plot is poignant and metaphorically effective.<br /><br />[Mini Spoiler Alert] And it thankfully chooses not to focus on Wolverine for a fifth time. After eleven long years spent watching Wolverine carcajou his way through his problems, it was a nice change of pace to have Hugh Jackman's role cut down to about 15 seconds of screen time--just long enough to drop the PG-13's one F-bomb (and it's a great one). Other than that, however, we're met with an entirely new cast who manage to make us truly feel for these mutants. [End Mini Spoiler Alert]<br /><br />James McAvoy steals the show as a young Charles Xavier. He's a walking, charming, drinking, womanizing piece of brain who just so happens to be a telepath. It's nice to see that he's not that different from us, really. The so-wise-he's-untouchable Yoda version of Professor X from the prior films is gone, and in his place is someone you feel you could get along with at a party, though he'd probably beat you in a chugging contest. I never truly understood Xavier's idealism before, but McAvoy shows us that doing the right thing can be a struggle. Xavier feels what all others feel, remembers what they remember. When he reads Magneto's mind, he is filled with just as much rage, and yet he is somehow able to still walk the path of righteousness. When I noticed how deeply I was reading into his character, it became apparent that this film was incredibly well written. How do you write dialogue for someone who is able to empathize completely with everyone he meets? Personally, I don't know (and as an aspiring screenwriter, this distresses me), but these guys nailed it.<br /><br />While there are epic stakes and CGI mutant powers aplenty, this film is mostly about the relationship between Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr a.k.a. Magneto. Luckily, Michael Fassbender does just as well with Magneto as McAvoy does with the Professor. The two have a genuine rapport, and Fassbender perfectly straddles the line between evil and relatable. After witnessing his life story, you can't really begrudge him his actions. His parents' death at the hands of the Nazis left him broken, a man for whom \\"peace was never an option.\\"<br /><br />The struggle to find inner peace seemed to affect all mutants, and while it was deftly handled for the most part, I found Beast's romance with Mystique to be uncharacteristically weak. For a film so good at delving into the hearts of its characters, I was disappointed to see their love story reduced to nothing more than a high-school level clich&eacute;. I get it, you're both blue and neither of you can accept what you've become. But if the civil rights movement has taught us anything, it's that you're not required to have sex with people who are the same color as you. Branch out a little, blue folk. Then again, this was the early 1960s, so maybe they were just taking care to avoid any anachronisms. Either way, their potential relationship was nothing more than Mystique fawning over Beast with endless doe-eyed gazes just because he also didn't fit in. I guess he's probably into the doe-eyed thing though--deer are beasts, right?<br /><br />Poorly executed romantic entanglements aside, Mystique still brought a good deal of heart to this film. One of my favorite aspects of the X-Men franchise is that Magneto the villain and Xavier the hero share a close bond. Good and evil are more subtle here, shades of gray drawn with the ink of human emotion, rather than unrealistic characters who embody pure justice and malice. X-Men: First Class delivered on this complicated relationship more successfully than I could have thought possible. It perfectly portrayed the way two groups could be enemies in intent and method, but friends on a personal level. It was in this way that Mystique's presence was so compelling, for she and Xavier are foster siblings, yet in the end, she sides with Magneto, unable to come to terms with the world Xavier is working toward, a world in which mutants may forever remain downtrodden. The two siblings still love each other, but they are unable to reconcile their differences, and their parting is a touching moment.<br /><br />It's a great movie! Real issues, real relationships, real badass. I never thought I'd like another X-Men film, but it turns out I was wrong. The actors nail these roles, and the script is fantastic. It actually gets you to care about its characters in a way that no superhero film ever has.<br /><br />Score: 4/5¢<br /><br />How did a bunch of drunk kids pick perfect character aliases first try every time? Mutants with powers that make physics look like a set of suggestions is one thing, but there weren't any mutants with the power of overwhelming creativity on the team, were there? WERE THERE? Ok, sorry. Maybe this is just hitting a little too close to home.<br /><br />Check out more on \\"The Nickel Screen\\" (Google it!)be they were just taking care to avoid any anachronisms.

It actually gets you to care about its characters in a way that no superhero film ever has.    Score: 4/5¢    How did a bunch of drunk kids pick perfect character aliases first try every time? Mutants with powers that make physics look like a set of suggestions is one thing, but there weren't any mutants with the power of overwhelming creativity on the team, were there? WERE THERE? Ok, sorry. Maybe this is just hitting a little too close to home.    Check out more on \\"The Nickel Screen\\" (Google it!)
0307455874|1.0|I like to know how other people think especially so regarding business 'competitors'. So I read this to gain perspective. My opinion is that this book is a political set up for a scam and it seems very likely it may have been ghost written. Megalomaniacal tones abound and a basic but overwhelming misunderstanding of the American experience. This is very sad. I am not proud to have paid a royalty for this rag but that is the system we live in.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Wow!  I thought this book was going to be an okay book.  The description made it seem interesting, but I wasn't sold on it until I saw some of the reviews.  This is definitely one of best books I have read in a long time, and as an avid reader, I've read a lot of books!

B0031YJFCQ|2.0|This book is so full of extra crap spaced throughout it that it's tough to read.  The first book \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" was fantastic.  The main characters Salander and Blomkvist were great together.<br /><br />Who cares about some other prime minister who was assassinated in 1982 or whatever the date was?  I'm 42% in to this book and the plot is pretty much non-existent.  I just don't care about any of the extra Swedish crap.  I just want a story.  And where the heck are the page numbers?
B0035ZA3XQ|5.0|Still in shock, in awe. Undescribable. Amazing. Let´s put it this way: I´m 33 years old, rocker since I was 10 (bought Powerslave and Smashes, Trashes & Hits). Bil Led Zeppelin fan, amongst so many others (just for the context). Went to a JB concert last year and have fallen in love ever since. True, never heard this album before. It is one of the best things I have ever heard. That´s it.  (Oh, I bot the album, the LP; man, that sounds awesomely good. Oh my.) Won´t sleep tonight (it just got here and I had to write something, despite the losfer´words.

0385341008|5.0|I highly recommend The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society.  Few books have the ability to combine historical fiction, romance, and whit in such an easy to read format.  The story is told through a compilation of written messages.  Juliet Ashton, a British columnist, writes most of the letters but some are also from inhabitants of Guernsey and Juliet's friends and publisher.<br /><br />The book begins with a Juliet's witty introduction.  We learn that Juliet wrote a satirical column during World War II about life in London.  Juliet appears to have a temper, if provoked, and has thrown a few objects at those who provoke her.  We also learn that Juliet has a soft side, for she has sent a book to a man in Guernsey, Dawsey Adams, who she has never met.<br /><br />Juliet enjoys corresponding with Dawsey and learns that Dawsey took part in a Literary and Potato Peel Society during the war.  Through Dawsey, we also begin to learn about Guernsey's occupation by the Germans.  Juliet decides to write a story about the occupation and Dawsey arranges for other members of the literary club to tell their stories to Juliet.  After a short time, Juliet decides to visit Guernsey where she meets various unique characters who are nicely developed throughout the book.  In particular, we learn about Elizabeth and the sacrifices Elizabeth made during the war and Kit, Elizabeth's daughter.  Scattered throughout the story we also learn about Juliet's humorous love interests.<br /><br />Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows do a beautiful job telling the story of life in Guernsey during the occupation.  They tell the story of the boat of children who left Guernsey immediately before the Germans arrived, the horrible conditions on Guernsey during the occupation, and the plight of the Guernsey citizens sent off the island to German prison and concentration camps.  Shaffer and Barrows mix up the serious details of the war with humorous anecdotes so as to make the difficult facts easier to read.<br /><br />The authors also have an amazing ability to develop the various characters in the story.  We learn about Juliet's best friend Sophie through letters written by Sophie's brother Sidney and Juliet.  We learn about Juliet through her own letters but also those written by Sidney and other Guernsey inhabitants.  In fact, I enjoyed an early section of the book where Juliet has people write favorable and unfavorable character references about her so that Dawsey can understand Juliet's true character.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and am going to recommend it to my book club.

B004HYGF18|5.0|The Vaccines hit my radar when I was stalking Mumford and Sons online obsessively and learned that the Vaccines were going to tour with them. My only \\"con\\" with this album is that it is too short. I give it five stars anyhow. Great summer music. Great beat. The first song reminds me of the Jam \\"Town Called Malice\\"<br /><br />The Vaccines sound a little like James, The Smiths, The Killers and enough like themselves for me to say this is a great fun album and not derivative. I look forward to hearing more from them.

B002JVWRAE|5.0|[ASIN:B002JVWRAE The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]] My husband and I look forward to watching The Vampire Diaries every week and we are well into our 50's. We take issue with the assertion that this program is for the teenagers only! This is not your typical blood thirsty vampire show! The Vampire Diaries is a beautiful love story. It is about the desire in each of us to love, be loved and to become a better person or should I say .... vampire! It is about overcoming the evil in this world with acceptance and love. We feel as though we know each character and truly care about the outcome of the terror they face. Yet, make no mistake, The Vampire Diaries is a Vampire Sci-Fi extravaganza that will have you on the edge of your seat from week to week! It is a great fantasy to lose one's self in for approximately 40 minutes each week. Having been born and raised in Virginia, The Vampire Diaries setting, although filmed in the state of Georgia, has a particular charm and allure for me. Professional actors worthy of the iconic \\"Silver Screen\\" bring each character to life. The blu-ray quality is exceptional both visually and audibly. Now that Season 2 has ended, we cannot wait for it to be released on blu-ray.
B00003CXA6|2.0|I gave it two stars for the content of the historical accuracy of the events. (There is some disagreement but this is the Cival War after all). I would have given it a zero otherwise! First let me say that Hollywood could afford some beards that don't look like cheap side show minstrels! It was laughable. And casting Sheen for Lee?? Sheen looked like a circus clown scuffling around in a baggy uniform that didn't fit.  Lee's appearance in most photos is tall and regal.  The beautifil 19th century language is murdered, and the theatrics during battle, via Hollywood, didn't match any real time accounts I have read.  The title should be \\"Gettysburg, what Little Round Top would have been if fought in Culver City 1980\\"!    When are reinactors going to learn that clean pristene uniforms did not exist in battles such as Gettysburg!  I am always wary about movies on history but since I have seen this movie in the visitors center and reviews were pretty good, I thought maybe, just maybe, someone other than hypewood produced this.  Good thing it's so cheap, I don't feel so bad. But if you are pondering this as a representation of Gettysburg, wait until it comes to your local grocer next to the gossip mags. Gettysburg desserves better than this. Yor better off with Burns who at least seems to get the solemn nature of the event.

B0040JHLM2|5.0|Usually I am not writing reviews but after I ran for the first time in this shoe I was in heaven.  I am an athlete and ran in many shoes such as Adidas, Nike, Reebok, Puma, Asics you name them.  I was fine with Asics but the last two pairs gave me ankle pains and knee pain.  I took a risk not knowing much about Brooks and ordered them.  I am a bodybuilder weighing over 200 lbs and run for my cardio and once I started running in my new Brooks shoes no more pan.  Absolute the best shoe.
076790592X|5.0|Oh man, I actually really loved this book! I dived into it with no idea what so ever what it would be about, but just knowing that it was a book I've always wanted to read (don't even know why). Amazing story! I feel overwhelmed actually, with a mixture of admiration and sadness. I really think everyone should get their hands on this book at some point. The lessons that Morrie teach us are timeless and infallible. They come from a place that you cannot touch with mere theory... like Morrie says \\"Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I found this film because it is one of the few on rottentomatoes.com with a perfect 100% rating. That is, every professional film critic who reviewed the movie gave it a positive review. I was expecting a good movie and I got a great one. This is much more than just a documentary of a stuntman. It will teach you how to dream and remind you why you should chase your dreams, no matter how impossible they might seem. The story of wirewalker Philippe Petit is told like a heist movie. Indeed, his daring acts of performance art were completely illegal. The unapologetic and enthusiastic glimmer in Petit's eye is worth the price of admission.

B0045NXMJE|3.0|Not only am I a big fan of French film, I am also a big fan of director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Suffice to say, I was really excited about this movie.  Sadly, while the tone of the film was certainly in line with what I expected from this modern master of cinematic enjoyment (yes, I said it), I must admit that this film failed to do much of anything for me.  It is loud and charismatic and a carnival of sorts, but in the end it just seems like a hodgepodge of mediocrity.<br /><br />Saying that makes me very sad.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I love the macabre and the absurd, which are two things that Jean-Pierre Jeunet understands and it is precisely why I love him so much.  I mean, I don't have to explain to anyone my adoration of `Amelie', and that is considered by many to be one of his lesser works; so know that I love him THAT much.  That said; while `Micmacs' certainly is entertaining and it has that whole `absurd' quality that I love so much, it fails to balance it out with anything substantial.  At least `Amelie' knew how to create an absurdity that teetered on emotional complexity; something that felt human and lived in and truly cherished.  `Micmacs' feels slightly underdeveloped; like a gimmick tossed on a plate for minimal effect.<br /><br />The film follows a bunch of freaks as they embark on a mission to turn two major players in arms dealing against one another and create major problems for them; all the while helping one particular freak exact semi-revenge on the company responsible for his father's death and the company who produced the bullet that haphazardly found its way into his skull.<br /><br />Get all that?<br /><br />I like the story.  It has so much promise, and in the capable hands of Jeunet I'd expect it to be embellished to perfection, but it wasn't.  It was just a silly mess that never seemed to go anywhere important, and then when they did try and make some sort of poignant point about arms dealing (that whole ending) it came across manipulative and out of bounds with the rest of the film.<br /><br />I still have faith in Jeunet.  Every director is allowed a misstep here and there.  Even the greats have had their fair share of failed projects.<br /><br />At least Raphael Beau's score is effectively awesome.of the film.

0385474547|4.0|I knew nothing of this bk except that it was a well known literature novel. I enjoyed reading this... even though it wasn't a story that's enjoyable. I really appreciated Achebe's literary prose... the language was so beautiful. I quote for example \\"The faint and distant wailing of women settled like a sediment of sorrow on the earth.\\" It's quite a disturbing story nonetheless and the ending really hurt... broke my heart. I don't even know how I feel. All in all, I liked it!
B003EYVXXW|2.0|`Agora' is one of those films that tries to do so much and yet fails miserably to do much of anything.  It is essentially two stories running perpendicular that are supposed to become interwoven and yet neither story really feels whole and one aspect of the film feels like a poorly conceived side-plot that never gets the attention it deserved, for it was probably the film's more interesting feature.<br /><br />Taking place in Roman occupied Egypt, `Agora' tells the story of religious unrest amongst the turn of Christianity and the displaced values of the pagan populous.  With so many turning to Christianity, the ideals of those with `other' ways of thinking (or believing) become distained and despised, and effectively illegal.  Spanning a breadth of time, `Agora' begins by following a young slave named Davus who has fallen in love with a female philosopher, Hypatia, during the birthing pains of Christianity.  His feelings continue with him, even after he converts to Christianity and violently takes his freedom.  As the years progress, the tension between religious factions grows and soon Hypatia herself is being questioned and condemned despite her prestigious connections.<br /><br />The violence contained within `Agora' is not merely that of a physical nature, but the film's core themes and mood created reek of aggression.  This is one of the film's commendable traits, for it understands the mood it is trying to convey and it does so expertly.  I also loved the production design here, because it was so crisp and so clean, depicting the religious `purity' being toted and yet it always appeared so dirty, so dusty; great way to contrast their values with their actions.<br /><br />But that is about all I have for praise.<br /><br />The astrology aspect of the film could have lent itself in a more eventful manner, but the film tries to be almost too realistic for its own good and it loses any true grandeur.  The religious side of things can become hammy and overly theatrical, and while I understand that that is much the way of these `swords and sandals' epics, there is something about `Agora' that feels so; un-epic.  The acting is hit and miss, with Rachel Weisz delivering one of her most boring performances to date (where is the depth).  She has two scenes where she shines, and both involve a form of violation that attacks her emotions.  Max Minghella gives a standard (expected) performance, but his final scene (thanks to some heavy cinematic manipulations) is very effective.  The real flaws here are seen in the way that director Alejandro Amenabar painted his canvas.  The film just feels so underwhelming.  Amenabar tries to give provocative moments, but most of his directorial flourishes come across unnecessary.  The scroll throwing sequence in particular is a ridiculous use of CGI and takes away from what could have been a signature scene in the film (for the upside down ending shot was surprisingly superb).  Juggling the two focuses was not done well, and the astrology section underperforms and becomes pointless (unless you want to say it was there for authentic merit), a waste of time and essentially takes you out of the film.  Had Amenabar woven in a supernatural currency, then maybe that aspect of the film would have proved substantial, but in the end it is just a wasted focal point.  At times the film feels like a television production (think HBO's `Rome' or something of that nature) and at other times it feels like a halfhearted video game (that upwards glance at Davus's bloodstained sword and the ominous hoodies read video game to a T).<br /><br />It just doesn't come together like it was supposed to and winds up being yet another attempt to capitalize on a genre that ended when Russell Crowe's hand swept the glistening fields of wheat for the very last time.at that is much the way of these `swords and sandals' epics, there is something about `Agora' that feels so; un-epic.

0142410349|4.0|So I haven't seen the movie, or even the trailer. But I just read out this book in 1 hr flat! It was pretty cool! I gotta admit it got me hungry & a pretty nervous... just waiting to see what was gonna happen. My favorite quote: 'Bunce was cursing the fox with dirty words that cannot be printed' ... This so made me smile :-) lol Good stuff!
B002ZG993Q|5.0|Truth be told, `The American' is nothing like I ever expected it to be.  The film is such a brooding and electrifying character study that works so well it shocked me.  I was expecting a more straight forward action thriller, and while the action is certainly there (the bookends are sublime), the film has far more depth than that.<br /><br />Expertly paced, thoughtful and dripping with suspense.<br /><br />The film takes place in Italy, where a hit-man named Jack is awaiting details on his `final' assignment.  He's done.  He wants out.  He wants to pursue a life filled with the attachments he is deprived while smothered within the restraints of his profession.  During his stay in Italy, Jack becomes acquainted with a high-class hooker named Clara.  Despite the fact that emotional ties are dangerous, Jack wants to be with her.  Instead of broaching this plot point in the clich&eacute;d and generic fashion, `The American' beautifully uses the camera to expose the inner emotional complexities within Jack.  His feelings for Clara are less `love at first sight' and more deep-seated in the emotional loss he's experienced over years of distancing himself from everyone around him.  As Jack's eventual `job' rears its head, his world starts to unravel as he discovers his professional life cannot coexist with his intimacies.<br /><br />George Clooney certainly delivers his best performance in years.  I've always preferred my Clooney comedic, but this finely tuned dramatic performance is outstanding; so layered and complex.  Violante Placido is a gem of an actress.  Not only is she beyond words gorgeous (OMG), she is certainly talented enough to go step for step with Clooney and demand out attention.  She is also mysterious enough to keep the audience guessing as to what her true intentions are.<br /><br />The real star of the show is director Anton Corbijn.  His film debut was 2007's `Control' (what a debut), and his sophomore effort shows that it was no fluke.  He really is extremely adept at creating natural tension with the lens and pacing his projects to exude a stylistic naturalism.  The way he uses his surroundings to produce such lasting imagery, physical and emotional, is outstanding.<br /><br />In the end I can't help but recommend this film.  It sits on you, dwells in your mind's eye and definitely makes quite an impact.  It is a quieter film than one may expect, but it is within those quiet moments that the film really unveils itself to the audience.  Tackling serious subjects such as self-doubt and spirituality; `The American' is a brilliant film about a man coming to terms with his own fate.ension with the lens and pacing his projects to exude a stylistic naturalism.

B004X904JQ|2.0|Normally, I don't do song by song reviews, but I'll make an exception for this one. First of all, I am a HUGE Morbid fan, Pete Sandoval has been one of my all time drum idols since I started playing at 11. But this, is just....horrid. Nothing against Tim Yeung, this was out of his hands, but I wouldn't put my name on it. I read in Decibel that Trey felt this was an experimental album, and I couldn't agree more. I waited eight years for this? Let's get back to death metal guys, EXTREME MUSIC FOR EXTREME PEOPLE!    Omni Potens- Not much to be said for an intro. It almost sounds like something they left off of Formulas.    Too Extreme!- Give me a break, there was nothing extreme about this excuse for a death metal spun techno song.     Existo Vulgore- One of the few good tracks on the album. Great Morbid song. No bones to pick about it.    Blades For Baal- Again great Morbid song. I expected the whole album to be like these two songs.    I Am Morbid- Starts off with a \\"Domination\\" feel, but quickly turns into what sounds like a classic rock cover. A little too \\"anthemy\\" for a Morbid song.    10 More Dead- Again with the \\"Domination sound in the beginning, but sounds more like something Pantera, or maybe even Disturbed would put out.    Destructos Vs. The Earth/Attack- I read in another review, and can't find better words to describe it, other than \\"Powermorbid 5000\\"    Nevermore- A decent song for this album. Almost felt like a \\"Heretic\\" song minus Steve Tucker's vocals.    Beauty Meets Beast- Another decent song, but back to the \\"Domination\\" feel, whih at this point in the album, insn't a bad thing. \\"Domination was classic Morbid.    Radikult- And they fall right back to the \\"Powermorbid 5000\\"    Profundis-Mea Culpa- Sorry guys, but a horrbile way to end the album. More 808's...yay...
B0021L8V0M|4.0|That isn't to say that I don't appreciate Jolie's talent or enjoy her in more serious fare, but there is something about Angelina that demands your attention, and that attention is never better arrested than when Angelina is drop kicking bad guys and jumping out of moving vehicles.<br /><br />Surround her with explosions and she shines!<br /><br />`Salt' is an interesting film.  On the outset it seems like a generic action adventure film with little merit outside of Jolie's commanding presence.  Instead, what one finds is a remarkably well rounded film that understands the importance of building a story instead of staging a series of random action sequences.  The story presented in `Salt' is an engaging and thought provoking one, and while it is obviously handled in a way that puts the emphasis on the explosions, it doesn't forsake `brains' in the process.<br /><br />`Salt' tells the story of CIA agent Evelyn Salt.  Apparently she's a Russian spy.  This is news to her and soon she is on the run from her former friends and colleagues who want to detain her.  She seems to be mainly concerned for her husband's wellbeing, and of course clearing her name.<br /><br />Twists, turns and a lot of `booms' ensue.<br /><br />The action is top notch here, wonderfully paced to implode in the eardrums and eye sockets of the movie-watching public; and it works great.  Angelina kicks serious booty, and the slick editing makes for a thrilling ride.  I will call caution to the film's constant violent nature.  To be honest, there are many sequences that feel almost too graphic for the film's rating.  I'm shocked that it didn't receive an R rating (that stairway execution scene in particular was very rough).  So, be mindful of the kiddies.  The acting is all what you'd expect from a film in this genre.  I want to say that I really love Liev Schreiber and really wish he'd get better roles.  He has such acting talent (I still cry when I think of his performance in `A Walk on the Moon') but he never gets to really use it.  It appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).<br /><br />HOLLYWOOD, GIVE THESE MEN BETTER ROLES!!!<br /><br />Alas, there is no real reason to gripe about that here, since the film is elevated with his presence, and I'm happy about that.  In the end I totally recommend this.  It's loud, abrasive and IN-YOUR-FACE, but it has depth of story that is not often found within this genre.<br /><br />Stand up job, if I do say so myself.appears that he has Peter Sarsgaard syndrome (great actor reduced to stereotypical villain roles).

B0045EJY90|4.0|This is a good cd player for the money. The USB connection that bypasses the ipod's DAC and utilizes the cd player's far superior one is a nice touch. I run the P-650 through an NAD 7100 receiver with Yamaha NS-333 speakers and it sounds great. Then, for ultimate sound quality, I listen with Sennheiser HD-650 headphones. So use of a high quality amp/receiver, speakers and headphones is definitely recommended.

This is a safe interesting baby toy for all the little ones. Has a \\"hook\\" to clip anywhere like car seat or crib. Great to take any where. She also likes the rings on his tail and \\"jingle\\" sounds he makes when she shakes him. :)
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This excellent product arrived in perfect condition, well-packaged, and ready to use. While it was a bit tight to put on the iPhone, it fit snugly with very little adjustment at the outset. All the buttons on the sides fit the openings and the cover was well-suited for the phone. The protective screen worked well the first time and did not impede any of the phone's normal usage.     The clear idea means that the cover retains the look of a cell phone rather than some kind of new candy bar or strange wallet that many protective covers seem to value. On the down side, the cover probably does not protect from dropping on concrete or aggressive blows to the phone (I was not comfortable trying this out though). It does protect from general bumps, scrapes, and short falls from minor distances. Because of the feel of the cover, it seems to grip the hand simultaneously resulting in a less likelihood of dropping it. Quite comfortable and attractive, this is the ideal cover for those needing basic protection for their iPhone 4 and still keeping the look of an iPhone.     Highly recommended. This product was received free of charge as a Vine Review.

The disc is FULL of special features, from behind the scene looks (45+ minutes of the daily blog journal that Edgar Wright kept) to deleted scenes to an astoundingly large photo gallery (broken down by category) to one of my favorites, the TV-friendly excerpt edit, in which even the mildest swear words are replaced with innocuous substitutes.    But the disc is also FULL of commercial trailers and the like. I had to go through at least four to get to the main menu, and then the menu itself had promotional crap attached to it. This business of studios considering disc buyers a captive audience and contaminating the experience with unrelated promotional crap is getting out of hand.
0425166805|5.0|it was a good book well written though a little out there in ideas but some of the best things are. that is the future is it not? to dream of far-fetched things and make them reality?
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi make such good music together.  \\"Come See About Me\\" is a fun first track that just oozes with an energy that I love.  \\"Don't Let Me Slide\\" is a bluesy song.  This is a love song has great lyrics.  It is my favorite track on an album where every song is excellent.  The vocals by Susan and guitar playing by Derek are just flawless.  My other favorite cut is \\"Midnight In Harlem\\".  The vocals and guitar playing sounds very smooth on this song. \\"Love Has Something More To Say\\" has a funky retro tone to it.  I love the horn playing on this track very much.  \\"These Walls\\" is a beautiful song about a woman trying to hold her life together after her husband leaves. This song really moves me.  \\"Shrimp And Grits\\" is a groovy instrumental that is about a minute and a half long.  This track showcases Derek's talent as a guitarist.\\"Until You Remember\\" is a very pretty song about waiting for a lover to return.  The simple guitar chords are just lovely on this song.  \\"Bound For Glory\\" is an upbeat track that makes me happy.  Simple Things is a slower tempo song that makes me reflect on my life and my level of happiness.  This song is very deep.  \\"Learn How To Love\\" is the best rock and roll love song I have ever heard. This song is definitely one of the highlights on \\"Revelator\\".<br /><br /> \\"Shelter\\" is a song about finding a sense of security with a loved one.  The background vocals by Mike Mattinson and Mark Rivers is very good throughout this album. These guys could make and sell records based on their talent alone.  They are soulful moving singers.  \\"Revelator\\" is one of the best albums of the year.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|I loved the first installment of this series and gave it five stars. Ultimately I got bored with this second installment and cannot be nearly as enthusiastic. If an author is going to write a book twice as long as \\"War and Peace,\\" he'd better have something significant to say. I don't think that is the case here.<br /><br />This book divides into four sections. In the first part, Kvothe continues his misadventures at the university and pursues his hopeless unrequited love for the elusive Denna. This more or less continues the first book. In section two, he goes off to an obscure northern region to work for an aristocrat. Society is dominated by rigid and somewhere arcane social rules. He discovers a plot to poison the aristcrat.<br /><br />Section three: Kvothe is put in charge of a small band of mercenaries and told to discover and root out some bandits preying on travelers from a remote forested area. Having eventually succeeded in this task, Kvothe is whisked into faeryland where he is educated in the niceties of sexual congress by Tinkerbell -- sorry by the fairy Faerlurian, a temptress who has been around for thousands of years and accumulated a vast catalog of lovers.<br /><br />Section four: Kvothe finds himself in a matriarchal society whose members don't allow facial expressions. Instead, they express complex emotions through hand signals. Kvothe undergoes martial arts training at the hands of some very wise and scary women. He then rescues two villager girls from brigands pretending to be gypsies.<br /><br />At the end of all this, we get a long anticlimax in which Kvothe returns to the university and resumes mooning over the elusive Denna. And then the book peters out. We're invited to stay tuned for the third weighty installment -- but for me, enough is enough.<br /><br />The problem is that there's no narrative arc, no sense that the story is going anywhere. It's like the famous definition of history offered by a character in the movie, \\"The History Boys\\" -- just one f****** thing after another.er.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have been a fan of The Discovery Channel and NatGeo Channel for years.  And, I love documentaries on animals and nature such as March of the Penguins, African Cats, etc.  However, the BBC simply blows those out of the water with Planet Earth and [[ASIN:B002UXRGLG Life]].  The film/photography is literally stunning.  Even episodes that I expected to be boring (I prefer the animals, obviously) kept me engrossed because it was just so beautiful.  The BBC went to places I didn't even imagine existed, let alone cared about before seeing this.<br /><br />This is a phenomenal program for the entire family to enjoy.  I was lucky to snag this for $30 during the lightning deals at Christmas, but I would not hesitate to pay full price.  It is that good and the running time more than makes the cost reasonable.  This program is worth watching again and again to catch all the nuances missed on a first viewing.  Though I understand Bluray fans' upset at not getting the extras, I was pleasantly surprised not to be the one screwed for a change (as usually it is DVD releases that leave off the extras).  Highly recommended!
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I ordered this and received it in two days! That is the fastest I have ever received anything from Amazon! I was very pleased!!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|I loved [[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series]]. It was breathtaking and comprehensive.  So, I was a bit hesitant about ordering Life, thinking it would be redundant (as another reviewer suggested).  However, I found it to be a fantastic complement to that series.  There was a bit of overlap, but Life went into more details on, well, life.  I actually enjoyed this program more because it focused more on animals.  The BBC puts all other nature programming to shame with these two outstanding series.  The film/photography is literally stunning, and the footage they managed to captures comes close to being a miracle. The extras often go into detail on how long they had to film to catch particular segments (sometimes weeks for a minute or two of footage).  That was often as interesting as the show itself.<br /><br />This is a wonderful program for the entire family. I was lucky to snag this for $20 during the lightning deals at Christmas, but I would not hesitate to pay full price. It is that good and the running time more than makes the cost reasonable. This program is worth watching again and again. These shows are so good, they make me worry about Britain's budget crisis because I would hate to see BBC funding get cut!  Highly recommended.
1594202842|1.0|I don't think I've ever encountered a more status-obsessed person than Amy Chua. She's smart, but relentlessly shallow. She has her kids playing music not because she loves music, but because it's status-appropriate to her class and because there are easy markers of excellence. That is, she doesn't love Mozart, she loves Julliard. She doesn't love law, or justice, she loves Yale. They travel, but it's a just a list of cities she can rattle off.     It's a really dispiriting book. She's slick--making it about being \\"chinese\\" was a good way to sell books, but there is nothing at all Chinese about what she describes. It's the same behavior of ruthless stage mothers and status-obsessed climbers of all ethnicities.     Look here's the thing--driving your kids really hard might work out really well for you, depending on what you want. Or it might not. It's kind of a crapshoot. You can go through life saying things like \\"I can't be a shallow status obsessed airhead! I teach at Yale!\\" But it won't necessarily be true
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Who could possibly imagine any good reason why an Anglo Saxon high school senior (such as this movie's protagonist) should affect an Italian accent and become obsessed with bicycle racing?  Or that he conduct an elaborate courtship of a local college girl while still in character (Italian accent and all!)--complete with serenading her outside her dorm while singing in Italian!  I can't really give a good reason for such behavior--but I can imagine doing these things as a young person.  For me, it was learning German on my own, affecting a German accent, and listening to and learning the songs on vinyl Bavarian Alpine music records while imagining myself as a German scientist (a sort of Cold War stereotype).  I guess that such behavior comes from alienation from your own upbringing and surroundings while striving for something more inspiring and less limiting.  Anyway, this movie certainly resonated with my own experience when I saw it as a grad student nine years after the intoxicating summer that followed high school graduation.
140003180X|5.0|Alexander McCall Smith charms again in this fourth installment in his No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series. While Mma Makutsi opens the business of the book's title, seeking to ease the plight of men who cannot type but can't admit to it, Mma Ramotswe plays confessor for a client looking to atone for a past offense. Yet another case winds up involving one of Mma Makutsi's students, a mustachioed charmer with a center part. The case was taken first to a rival detective agency, just opened by a man with big-city connections. The competition is worrying, but Mma Ramotswe confronts the problem handily with bush tea, her unfailing love of Botswana and its people, and her innate good sense. Everyone should do themselves the favor of reading this series, which is a powerful source of calm in a busy world.<br /><br />-- Debra Hamel
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This game is fun, but I've lost all of my progress twice now. I really don't feel like replaying everything I've already beaten again, especially when I can't play in Quick Play mode until I beat Adventure Mode.
0307279189|5.0|Not only is this book the most important book I've read but it is also quite useful for college and high school courses.  I assigned the book to my students last semester and the number of students who responded with comments like, \\"This is the best book I've ever read!\\" was incredible.  No matter what department you're in, and especially if you're not a stuffy by-the-book prof or teacher (i.e., you're willing to explore other methods of instruction aside from those prescribed by your discipline for the past century or so), this book can teach your students a lot about interdisciplinary learning.  It uses biology, physiology, history, anthropology, art, literature, and other areas to explain how humans evolved as the most efficient long-distance running animals on the planet.  This message is so important in this age when our students' generation is actually more sedentary and has a higher rate of obesity and diabetes and heart disease, etc. than our own.  There's more to this book than just a wonderful read: It is a mission statement for all mankind.

0439023521|5.0|This book was highly recommended by a friend, so I decided to give it a go.  I immediately felt that the subject was too intense, didn't think I could handle it let alone enjoy it.... but by the end of the 1st chapter I couldn't put it down!  It is easy to read, intense, captivating, and so different from anything I'd ever read before.  I cannot recommend the Hunger Games enough, but just go ahead and buy all 3 because there's no way you can read the first and not go on to complete the series.  Incredible story.

0425241505|5.0|Pia Giovannis is dead. Well, not literally - but it's only a matter of time. Thanks to a no-good *EX* boyfriend, she has been suckered into an impossible task. A task so blatantly dangerous and stupid that she may as well pick out a burial plot right now. Because Pia is between a rock and a hard place when she is force to steal a penny, from a dragon. And not just any dragon, but the oldest, most notoriously feared and revered dragon in the world - New York's very own wyrkind, Dragos Cuelebre.<br /><br />When Dragos visits his loot and senses a penny missing he is enraged. Blazingly, uproariously pissed off and . . . oddly, charmed. Having been around since the dawn of time, not much is left to impress Dragos. But this cunning little half wyr half human female, with her beguiling sunshine scent, has caught his attention. True, she will also incur his wrath . . . but in the meantime, Dragos is beyond fascinated, he's well and truly smitten.<br /><br />`Dragon Bound' is the first book in a new paranormal romance series called `Elder Races', by Thea Harrison.<br /><br />There have been rumblings in the book blogosphere. Whispers and rumours have been spreading like wildfire . . . word on the blog-street is that there's a new paranormal romance writer to get excited over. And her debut hero is smoking hot, literally. Having finally succumbed to the excited testimonials of Smexy and KC, I finally got around to reading the first book in this sizzling new series, and I was blown away.<br /><br />`Elder Races' is set in an alternate world. There are other lands where supernatural meets reality; there is a Dark and Light fae court, and wyrkind can be anything from Gryphons to witches, elves and goblins to the very rare and very powerful dragon. In this world, the oldest dragon of them all is Dragos Cuelebre, and he rules, absolutely. He lives in the imposing Cuelebre Tower (a sort of Trump tower, for the reptilian set) and has his finger in any number of successful international enterprises. There are no photos of him (in dragon nor human form), no video footage and he has his very own fae PR-rep. So when Pia Giovanni is tasked to steal from this dragon's centuries-old accumulated loot, she is rightfully petrified. And when the deed is done and a penny stolen, she knows her life is forfeit.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the Dragon storyline. I mean, I like Smoky in Yasmine Galenorn's `Sisters of the Moon' series, and I have enjoyed my sporadic reading of G.A. Aiken's `Dragon Kin' series. But overall I would say that big, fiery and scaly is not really my bag, baby. Well, at least that's what I always thought . . . until Thea Harrison and Dragos came along.<br /><br />Harrison's story grips you from the word `go'. It's a combination of Pia's infectiously sweet, lunatic inner monologue, and Harrison's working old dragon mythology into a Trumped-up modern day being. I loved the idea of Pia stealing from Dragos's `loot' - and that their odd-ball pairing begins purely because old-as-dirt Dragos finds her `curious', when he hasn't felt genuine fascination in centuries. Harrison beautifully creates this David & Goliath romance between lowly, human Pia and fiery bad-ass Dragos. The beginning of the book is a cat and mouse game, as Pia tries to run from Dragos's inevitable wrath. With such pent-up anxiety and high-stakes, Harrison ensures that Pia and Dragos's first meeting sublimely sparks on the page.<br /><br />Pia and Dragos are, hands down, one of the best romances of 2011. They are paranormal perfection - Dragos is the typical Alpha, but with an extra dosage of hot-tempered and powerful. Pia is his lovely balance, snarky and wit-quick. These two explode on the page - especially in the early stages when Pia is both terrified of and lusting after the imposing Dragos. The sex scenes are powerful and gorgeously graphic, especially when tempered with the inherent beauty in one of the world's oldest beings falling in love with a curious halfwyr half human woman.<br /><br />The beauty of Harrison's book also lies in the character-mystery woven throughout the story. Pia has a secret, a secret that she has kept since childhood and her mother worked hard to protect her from. Dragos senses Pia's magical-brilliance, but Pia is so scared of herself and the power she possesses that she tries to secret herself away from him. While Pia and Dragos fall into an unlikely and combustible romance, the true test of their relationship will come when (or if) Pia chooses to reveal herself to Dragos. I loved this added mystery to the story - especially because Pia's eventual reveal is darling and clever, and a total curveball for unknowing me.<br /><br />`Dragon Bound' is paranormal romance perfection. Honestly, Thea Harrison ticks all the boxes - a deliciously imposing Alpha, spit-fire heroine, an interwoven mystery and enough interesting secondary characters to pull me into this new `Elder Races' series. `Dragon Bound' is definitely a favourite book of 2011, Harrison has become a must-buy author and the countdown has begun for the second book, `Storm's Heart'.lso lies in the character-mystery woven throughout the story.

B001F12J0C|5.0|I have been a Matt Damon fan since seeing his performance in \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" I like spy, mystery and some action, but a good story plot grabs me every time. I purchased the Trilogy because there is so much going on that I had to view each one more than once. I am glad the story was not crammed into one or two movies. Three was just right. Another quality performance by Matt Damon. Great plot.

B004EPYZUI|3.0|I find myself wondering if these reviewers are being paid to write the things they are saying......Sucker Punch was a complete head scratch-er for me! I left the theater disappointed and confused as to how & why this movie happened. While visually stunning, yes folks this movie is a beautiful cornucopia of brilliant colors, dazzling effects and amazing action sequences, the story was absolute fodder! This was one of the most nonsensical movies I have ever seen! Not that the plot was terrible, no. The plot was fair. Super hot troubled girl with difficult past makes a mistake that lands her amongst more super hot troubled girls who instantly dislike & distrust one another but eventually ban together to face a difficult escape from some horrible backdrop. I's been done to death! Albeit never so beautifully. It's the execution that is the total WTF element to this film.<br />The action sequences have so little to do with the rest of the film that I am still to this day unsure of what it was I was looking at. If you have not seen this film I promise you it is NOT what you think it is! It is more akin to a Pan's Labyrinth but without the brilliance. And yes there are Matrix elements shamelessly strewn about which sort of make up for the lack of sense in the story/action sequence tie in. My advice? See it before you buy it......I'm still on the fence about whether I'll be purchasing this movie or not. I just don't know if the eye candy justifies the terrible execution.
B0045HCJ94|5.0|This is one of the more powerful plays of the twentieth century, brilliantly presented by this cast, notably Burton and Taylor.  It occurs over a week-end (three days) and has to do with death and resurrection (Burton actually recites the Dies Irae, the old gradual for a requiem mass).  I'm glad to get a copy while it is still available.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I think the headphones are good for the money. The sound is good, my only complaint is not enough bass. The thing I don't like about them is the cord is kind of short. I am about 6ft tall and when my mp3 is in my pocket it pulls on the headphones making it sometimes irritating.
B004VUP8WK|2.0|After eagerly waiting eight years we get an EP's worth of decent material.<br />Six good(not great) songs is all that is to be found on this album and the rest of the songs are just plain BORING, POORLY WRITTEN and have IDIOTIC LYRICS. They are not bad because as some say the band is \\"progressing\\" and closed minded fans can't deal with the change, they are bad because the band is regressing. Doing generic industrial metal songs that sound like something Marilyn Manson did in the mid 90's is not progress. The worst part is the bad songs are some of the longest songs on the album clocking in at 6 to 7+ minutes long.<br /><br />I don't mind a band experimenting and adding new elements to their sound but make sure the new stuff you are doing is actually good before you put it on an album!<br />This album was not worth the eight year wait and not worth paying full price so if you find it used for $5 I would suggest buying it, but don't pay more than that.
B004KX5KPI|1.0|It's hard to credit that in 2011 any company would produce a remastered surround sound mix, and then use the less-than-CD quality DTS (tolerable) and Dolby (suitable only for speech) film soundtrack formats on a DVD-V to present it (source nickcaveandthebadseeds.com/collectors-editions-part-3). What's the point?    Even the second generation optical disc allowed for high resolution audio surround on SACD (5.1 DSD) or DVD-A (24b/96kHz 5.1 PCM). Without debating the pros and cons of each format, suffice to say that heavy music collectors can survive comfortably buying only music on SACD.    Failing that, third generation optical discs are now five years old. The Naxos and 2L labels have started regular releases on Blu-ray audio-only discs (the capability is 24b/192kHz 5.1 or 24b/96kHz 7.1 PCM surround). Neil Young has presented his early work on BD in 24b/192kHz stereo PCM sound. Rush and Tom Petty have BD audio stereo/surround discs out etc etc. And BD players are dirt cheap.    The most rubbishy recent film you can think of is probably out on BD with a surround track in better quality than offered here.    So, these high definition surround masters can stay in the vault as far as I'm concerned. It's only a matter of time before they're re-released in a way that will do them justice.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Really enjoyed this purchase. I bought this used and it's clear this guy's durable because of it. Just heavy enough that it feels substantial and grips to the desk.<br /><br />For smaller hands, the G1 and G7 keys are a little out of the way. As your average sized female, I feel the size, while a little large, is definitely something you can get used to. Even the G1 and G7 keys - just not for things I always need ;)<br /><br />In using the joystick for movement functionality I've noticed two things. First, that it's best to link Strafe Left and Strafe Right rather than any turning options. Second, that I almost never use the two keys around it. I just mapped one to alt and this hasn't been a problem.<br /><br />If you're using a Razer Naga with this, just switch it to 123 and keymap from there.<br /><br />Solid gaming device!

Radio staples like \\"big time\\" ,\\"in your eyes\\"<br />(what woman doesnt like that one?) and my fave\\"sledgehammer\\" which debuted the same time as that ground-<br />breaking show( SO underloved by ******* execs) all sound new & fresh every time I hear them!

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I usually don't get moved by just anything, and this album is definetively not anything. I have already heard it like 50 times and 50 times I feel her passion.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|It was definately in interesting movie.  Winona Ryder was in it for like 6 seconds.  The movie goes back and forth a lot, so you aren't really sure what's real.  However, you are seeing everything from Nina's (Portman) perspective, so I guess it makes sense since she's falls into this black swan role.  Overall, it was worth watching once - but I can't say i'd watch it again.
0307387178|4.0|Chris McCandless, Alexander Supertramp...whatever you prefer to call him...lived a life by his own standards and did what he inherently desired to do.  In the end, he died a painful death, starving and surrounded by solitude.  \\"That's the book about the moron who starved to death in Alaska, right?\\" asked a NAVY Seal friend of mine the other day when I mentioned reading this book.  \\"That guy had some balls, awesome story\\" reflected another.  McCandless has been a polarizing figure since his story first hit print.  Whether you believe he was an idiot for believing he could head off into the Alaskan wilderness and survive, or if you admire his existential thought process and his unwavering faith in his desire to live off the wild, the book is fascinating.    Reviewing the story from the point of view of an outsider looking for entertainment and a good tale, I wish I could give the book 4.5 stars.  Not as good as \\"Into Thin Air\\" in my opinion, but a heck of a story.  From my perspective, living like McCandless chose to live is certainly not conventional, but I can't say it doesn't leave me a bit envious or inspired by his convictions.  The guy stuck to his guns until the very end.  I will say this, when my children are hitting the college age, I will hide this book from them.    Fascinating read from start to finish--quick read as well.  I can also tell you this, if you liked the movie (which I happened to catch while traveling in the Dominican) and I thoroughly enjoyed it, the book is far better.  The movie changed a few things, and left McCandless looking like a fool at the time of his death by making a mistake in his harvest, when it very well could have left him in a better light as you'll see when reading Krakauer's account.    Awesome, well worth the read.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|As a fan of both Derek and Susan I was a bit dubious about them combining their individual bands into this extended 11-piece band. However, from the first track \\"Come See About Me\\" they hit the ground running - starting out with an acoustic slide intro before settling down into a blues-funk groove featuring Susan's wonderful vocals, Derek's peerless slide guitar and Kofi Burbridge on clavinet. The rest of the CD is of a similar high standard, with great songs, marvelous playing that is full of emotion but is also very subtle. The large line up is used wisely, the album doesn't feature the full band on every track and there is lots of space but the different elements add variety when necessary.<br /><br />Although there are obviously similarities with both Derek and Susan's previous work, they have collaborated with others such as Jeff Trott, John Leventhal, David Ryan Harris, Sonya Kitchell, Oliver Wood, the Jayhawks' Gary Louris and Soulive's Eric Krasno to bring in some outside influences to the songwriting. Nevertheless, Mike Mattison's \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" (as featured in Clapton's Crossroads DVD) is one of the best songs here. The record was recorded in Derek and Susan's home studio in Florida and sounds great, it's also possibly the reason that Susan sounds so relaxed. I think that up to now she has never made an album that has really shown her true potential but I think that this one definitely does - she goes from a whisper to a scream and really sells every song, an outstanding vocal performance.<br /><br />The album is so consistently good that I find it hard to pick a favourite track, although \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" is right up there, as is the restrained \\"These Walls\\" where Derek's guitar counterpoints Alam Khan's sarod. I also really like \\"Learn How To Love\\" - one the album's most bluesy tracks - and also the slow soul burner \\"Until You Remember\\", with beautiful restrained brass and Stax-style backing. There isn't as much of Derek's guitar on this album as on his own band records but his contributions are, as ever, absolutely superb- lyrical and sinuous but with real bite. My one regret about the album is that the wonderful singer Mike Mattison is relegated to a backing vocalist, surely they could have let him sing lead on one track? I'm really looking forward to seeing the band in the UK at the Shepherd's Bush Empire at the end of June!and records but his contributions are, as ever, absolutely superb- lyrical and sinuous but with real bite.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is a great match for a touch interface - going back to the pc version is hard!  Then I notice the graphics and performance on my pc, and realize niether version is perfect.   if i could have higher resolution and a faster load, this would be my favorite android game yet.

B000K5ZHMG|3.0|Caligula is a graphic account about the Roman ruler. The unrated version is so graphic that it's equal to an X-rated movie, even by today's standards. Caligula is an interesting movie, worth renting, and is very disturbing in it's violence and sexuality. There are multiple versions of Caligula available, I would recommend you get the unrated version as it will have the greatest impact.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Really?   Welcome to the 21st century Star Wars production people.  You discovered the Blue Ray technology....Bravo!!  Yeah, I lost interest in Star Wars when they screwed with the original trilogy and can't even offer a decent Blue Ray package in time.  If they think I am one of those idiots who they think would be more excited that I have to wait, then they are wrong.  I gave it one star because ZERO stars was not an option.  No thank you.  I will not buy this.

This is actually my \\"3rd\\" copy of this album, because it seems that everytime I get a copy, someone else takes it into their possession. LoL This cd is hard to keep your hands on...protect it well around friends and family or it will go missing! =) Enjoy the best Enigma album yet!
0307477479|5.0|I have a rocky relationship with postmodern and post-pomo fiction and tend to tiptoe around it.  Jennifer Egan, however, rises above what I consider the pitfalls of contemporary lit fic in A Visit From the Goon Squad.  It is inventive and has vision and energy.  I can see why it reached the Pulitzer finals despite being very different from past winners.  I recommend taking patience with it: I could not understand at first what all the blurbs meant about meaningful characters--I found them irritating--but in time I did come to care about them.  Egan is stealthy with your affections.     Essentially, Egan looks at the impact of the passage of time (\\"Time is a goon,\\" more than one character says) and the changes that must come with it on lives lived for the moment.  What better backdrop than the music scene of the early 1980s, specifically the punk community, the brash, outlawish next new thing back in the day, whose adherents lived without respect for the consequences of their actions.  Each of the chapters is a short story connected to the others by characters in common, working back and forth in time, and finally into the future.  The stories and voices vary in style and tone, and can surprise you with sudden brutal or sympathetic strokes. Egan freely mixes humor and pathos.     My favorite chapter is the story told through PowerPoint slides, defying its reductive form by conveying a vivid, heart-tugging portrait of a family in the near future, living in the desert.  It has everything that takes this book into orbit above mainstream lit fic.  To say more is to throw some spoilers.  Give it a try.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Best album in a long time, from anyone. This album reminds me why I love pop. Lady Gaga reminds me why I love pop. For those who are upset that it's different, I can only laugh. It should be different. It's called growth. If it was the same as The Fame/Fame Monster, you'd all be yelling that it was tired & stale. Actually, I would too.<br /><br />As for Madonna references & Madonna fans hating on her...rediculous. I couldn't be a bigger Madonna fan (multiple tattoos, standing in line for days...her autograph hangs over my head as I type. I'm 40 & have been a fan from the beginning. Hating Gaga does NOT make you a better Madonna fan. Just ignorant. Even Madonna likes her! And btw, Madonna has boldly \\"borrowed\\" from the beginning!). Every artist is influenced by the people they grew up listening to and admiring. This is not a wanna-be album! I also hear Queen, Prince, Springsteen, The Ronettes, Pat Benatar...what could be bad about that? She learned from her elders & made it her own. It's Gaga! Plus, Gaga's voice sounds stronger, the hooks & beats are fun, the music is tight, the album flows, and she allowed herself to bleed emotions. Only a half-@ssed Little Monster would dislike it. And Madonna fans (who are threatened over nothing) are actually missing out. The history books are written. Madonna earned her crown. But there is room for more, and we're better for it. This True Blue Madonna fan couldn't be happier with Gaga. I've got a kick @ss album to wear-out. You've got jealousy & bitterness. I win!<br /><br />Initial favorites were Marry The Night, Government Hooker, Americano, & ScheiBe. However, all grab me now, especially the Ronettes-like styling on The Queen, with it's beautiful & heartbreaking imagery & vocals. If you love pop (or use to love pop), then you owe it to yourself to get this album! I only wish I could give it more stars!<br /><br />PS. For the record, the 2 days that Amazon sold it for $.99, was Amazon's doing. It's truly ridiculous & foolish to slam Gaga for that. They're a store and have a right to sell products for any price that they wish. They were just trying to cash in on her popularity. It's a capitalist country & they can't be faulted for that...but neither can Gaga. Grow up!ey're a store and have a right to sell products for any price that they wish.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Room is a great read, with plenty of clever viewpoints from the characters, even though it's told completely in first person through Jack, who's five.    The premise and setting have become sadly and terrifyingly familiar news stories recently, but this world shines with hope for the two main characters.      Ma's strength and protective love for Jack haunted me as a mother.  I really felt that the author offered a deep insight into this aspect of the entire ordeal.      I'd highly recommend this work, but only if the reader's in a good mental place at the time to handle it.  This isn't a book to take on if you've got a lot of stress or worry in your life at the time.

B00127RAJY|5.0|On a visit to Salt Lake last month my friend told me about this DVD and suggested I workout with her.  Being a workout LOVER I agreed.  As we walked to her family room she explained the workout was only 20 minutes so it wouldn't take up too much of our time.  \\"Only 20 minutes?!\\" I replied.  I then asked, \\"What workout will we do after? I need to workout at least 30 minutes to feel like I've done something.\\"  She looked at me, smiled and told me this should be sufficient.  She popped in the video, clicked on LEVEL 3 and we were off.  As Jillian began leading us through the warm up I pondered if I should go for a run after...  POST WORKOUT--  My face was RED, I was sweating like crazy and all I wanted was a cold shower!  Next day I bought my own copy of the video and have been doing it every day since! Of course I began at Level 1 and am now, 2.5 weeks later, on Level 3. I haven't changed my diet, workout Mon-Sat and definitely see results!  My legs, arms and abs are more toned, & my derier has been lifted! I LOVE looking in the mirror and seeing the great physical changes that have occurred!  Another friend recently recommended Jillian's Abs video.  I'm online today buying ALL of her DVDs!  For me personally, working out with Jillian is the best way to prepare for bathing suit season!  Best of luck!    Jillian = Results!  :)

B004G600A4|5.0|I don't understand why people have mixed reviews, but my daughter loves it to the point that other cartoons seem not as entertainment. I think she watch it over 8 times already (separate occassions). Songs are great and the plot is not too crazy.
B002ZG976U|5.0|If you missed this movie in the theater; purchase the DVD, you won't be disappointed.  My 18 year old daughter (a dancer) really enjoyed it as well. I may purchase another copy and send off to college with her.  Extremely entertaining; love the costuming and choreography.
0670022411|5.0|I bought this book on a whim, having a little Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Hunger Games withdrawal. It was slow going at first, but once you hit the middle it picks up so quickly you can't put it down. The sequel promises to be better than the first, and when I closed the book I was thoroughly upset we have to wait until 2012 to continue the story. It reads likes movie, written to play out on in your head with interesting characters, humorous scenes, and lots and lots of hot vampire material to make the book perfectly spicy. What's best part about the book though is the intricacies. The author does a wonderful job going deep into the hierarchy of witches and demons, exploring history, and answering any questions that might pop into your head as you read along. For any True Blood fans out there this will appeal, so I highly recommend. I truly believe if you stick with the book, by the last page you'll be hooked. You have to get through the beginning, but once you hit the upward slope it doesn't let up. In total, give it a chance. I'm a very picky reader, but I vowed to finish what I started, and I'm so happy I did.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  I never played it before, so it's all new to me.  Lots of fun, plays great on my epic 3g!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm addicted to this game. Works great, only gripe I have about this game is, why does it have to load the game all over again after switching between recent apps?? No other game or app I have does that, should be able to just pop right back to the pause screen.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Now that Angry Birds is out, this game is in.  I love playing this almost every night since I got it.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I held off buying this for a long time standing behind the reason that \\"if it's not UDO on the vocals it will suck\\", boy was I wrong.  This release is as good as Balls and Metal Heart.  Very modern metal sounding without losing the Accept flair. Very impressive.  \\"The guy can sing....\\"
B000000OSE|5.0|What can we say about this amazing group and album. Just perfect. It has very classic and great songs like: Right next door to hell - dust n bones - live and let die - don't cry - November rain. These tracks are enough to characterize the album perfect and let me rate with 5 stars this album. The other songs are also great . A must buy for anyone who likes the sound of electric cool quitar.
B00009ATKS|4.0|I pick this up late, after there last three releases, so \\"true\\" Mogwai fans might slam me on this.  The release is good, but is doesn't compare to \\"Mr Beast\\", \\"Hawk...\\", and \\"Hardcore...\\".  If your a fan you will like it.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|This is one of the coolest releases I have heard in awhile.  Quirky, talented, 80's sounding, Mercyful Fate'ish...Awesome.  If your a fan of metal (Warning: To the religious of the world, strong evilness) you should add this to your collection ASAP.
0670022411|1.0|I had high hopes for this book when I started reading it -- witches, vampires and demons all in the same stew, this should really be fun.  Or should have been.  What it turns out to be is a monumental bore.  The plot turns on a lost manuscript, a 1500 year old vampire and a witch who's not sure if she wants to be a witch or not.  The supposed love story between the witch and the vampire is plain tedious, and the book collapses somewhere in the middle after a big confrontation between good and bad un-humans.  The book rambles on and on and goes nowhere.  After slogging through three-hundred-something pages I gave up and chucked it into the round file.  Stephen King might have able to serve up something tasty with these ingredients, but Deborah Harkness turned it into an unpalatable mish-mash.  I'll pass on her next one.<br /><br />Judy Lind

0739368435|5.0|This is the book that started it all for me!<br /><br />One of my colleagues recommended this book to me. She raved about it so much that I knew I just had to read it. But when would I have the time?? I have not read any books \\"for pleasure\\" since before my elder daughter was born, so that is eight long years...too long! I have always been an avid reader ever since I was a child, and I read a ton of books with my children, but none for myself.<br /><br />The library had a very long waiting list for this book, but the CDs were available. Since I spend about three hours each week driving to and from work, I thought that would be an ideal time for me to listen to the book. Now, oral comprehension was one of my least favourite subjects in school. I always found it difficult to listen to long ramblings and then have to answer questions...my mind always tended to wander. Not so with this audiobook! I found myself getting lost in the lively narration. I wasn't simply listening to someone read: There are different voices for different characters, and you can hear the emotion in their voices. It was like watching a play with my eyes closed. Great performances by the narrators!<br /><br />The book is a series of letters written between an author and a group of residents living on the island of Guernsey. The book takes places shortly after the German occupation following World War II, with the first letter being written in January 1946. This is not the type of book that I would have picked up to read in a million years. The subject of the book just did not suit my taste. It sounded boring! Boy, was I wrong!!<br /><br />I cannot rave enough how fantastic this book is!! I believe that -- had I read the book -- I would not have found it nearly so interesting! The narrators are fantastic, and I found myself falling in love with Juliet (narrated by Susan Duerdin) and Dawsey (narrated by either Paul Boehmer or John Lee) and Isola (narrated by Rosalyn Landor). I couldn't wait to see how the book ended, but I also dreaded reaching the end because I wanted it to go on and on!<br /><br />The author weaves historical content into the fiction, and I found myself fascinated with the time period. This book has become my favourite book of all time!<br /><br />MY RATING: 5 stars!! Loved it!!!!!!!readed reaching the end because I wanted it to go on and on!

It was actually sitting at #1 on Macleans Fiction List for the week of March 8th, 2011.<br /><br />It is a pretty disturbing book written from the perspective of a five-year old boy named Jack, who has spent his entire life in captivity.

0345529057|5.0|I am a sucker for a great Epic series, and this certainly classifies as one. I had read the first book a year ago, and when I noticed it had been picked up for an HBO show, I finally got around to buying.reading the rest of the series. It doesn't dissapoint! I love that the characters are constantly evolving. I get frustrated when an author takes the 'easy' route and makes boring, flat 'evil' villains and phony, idealistic 'good' heroes. Every chapter of this book gave me a new insight into each character, and many of them changed my opinions of them, and shifted my 'alliances' as a reader. I finished the series rooting for an entirely different outcome than the one I started with. I love that.<br /><br />This four pack is attractive and colorful. The previous reviews that complain about the books getting caught when sliding into the cardboard case are correct, but for the price I'm not that surprised.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B003L20IFQ|4.0|I feel compelled to right this review after seeing, what I would consider undeservedly harsh reviews. If you don't already know this story chronicles the story of a man who has been kidnapped and buried under ground. With only a cell phone, pocket knife, and lighter (among some other items). Shortly into the movie we learn that he is being held for ransom of 5 million dollars. This is a thrilling movie that never leaves the confinement of a coffin but manages to keep the viewer hooked and eager to see what happens next. I assure you that this is a good movie and certainly not the \\"Worst Movie ever\\" like some individuals have expressed.------Ben Eckert

B002VPE1AW|2.0|Some films you don't have to see to know they're going to be disappointing and if ever there was a film that was so hyped you knew it would be a let down 'Avatar' is it. OK, so it's a bit lame I haven't seen it till now and I know I'm only watching it on TV not a big 3D screen. In my defence a film should work on its own merits and not require effects like 3D to make it impressive.     So what did I think? To be honest I don't have much to say. Given the film cost the GDP of a small country to make, and has grossed even more, that's a bit worrying. But the film didn't muster much in me. It was just average.     I could mention the naff dialogue (but I can see plenty of others here have already done that) or the fact that Cameron has borrowed liberally from his own 'Aliens' - the company man here is just like Burke, the big walking machines are like the yellow loaders etc. Or the rather flat characterisation. Or cod environmentalism. Or the dreadful Horner score...     More pointedly, I thought the fact that Jake is accepted by the natives a bit unconvincing. Given he's an outsider I couldn't see why they adopted him. Yes, there is that scene that shows he's the chosen one but I felt Cameron's script could have worked a bit harder to convince.     I didn't think Pandora was a particularly original setting. There are still many reassuringly earthy things there - like horses, but with six legs. It seemed a fantasy version of this world rather than a totally alien world. Also - and I know this may sound like a daft thing to say - it didn't look real. Of course I know it's not real but to my eye it all seemed so obviously computer generated.     My other big criticism was, sorry to say this, I found it a bit boring and long winded. It took too long to get going. Jake's monotone narration doesn't help with this.     On the plus side once war is declared the film moves up several gears. In that way it reminds me of 'Titanic' in that the last hour is what you've been waiting for. The scene where the big tree is felled is undeniably moving and the final battle ain't bad either (if all a bit familiar). But as the credits ran I was left with an overwhelming sense of, 'so what?' 'Avatar' is all spectacle and little substance.     PS - 'Unobtainium'? Really? I mean, REALLY?

0307716511|4.0|This story is a letter to a beloved sister. The narrator, Bea, describes her search for the truth behind her sister's disappearance, which becomes linked with a pregnancy and apparent suicide. The immediacy of the telling is subtly layered, focusing on the history of the sisters' bond to understand present events, which are relayed in three close time periods: the first, Bea's observation of the investigation; the second, her retelling of events to a lawyer; and the third, the drafting of the letter. Sister is a suspenseful mystery touching on devotion, betrayal, self-absorption, madness, and above all, grief.

I can't simulate listening to this album - nor would I want to.  nothing's a surprise these days between song samples and albums that get downloaded weeks before a release date because no one wants to buy a CD with one good song.<br /><br />there used to be pleasant surprises in music when you, because you have so many of the artist's previous albums, picked up the new one and felt like everything was moving forward.  this man has no concept of artistic stagnation and seems to consistently prove it - subtle evolution, but never stagnation.

Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks are \\"Simple Things\\" (beautiful keyboard/blues guitar combination, melody & vocals), \\"Until You Remember\\" (slow track with incredible blues guitar & vocals) & \\"Shelter\\" (beautiful melody, vocals & great guitar solo). Great tracks include \\"Come See About Me\\" (opening track, countryish-blues sound with great guitar work), \\"Don't Let Me Slide\\", \\"Midnight In Harlem\\", \\"Bound For Glory\\" (great keyboard/guitar combination), \\"Ball And Chain\\", \\"These Walls\\" (great guitar pick-ups, vocals & melody), \\"Learn How To Love\\" (great 'stop-start' track), \\"Shrimp And Grits(Interlude)\\" (great guitar solo) & \\"Love Has Something Else To Say\\". There is no weak track or CD fillers here. On overall, this is a very impressive blues CD by Tedeschi Trucks Band, a highly recommended CD listening.

0810979772|5.0|I bought this book for my son and he loves writing in it all his adventures with his friends. It's a real neat book for kids.
B001TODO54|5.0|I loved this book.  I'd been reading a lot of rather dull novels, and this I actually made myself ration so I could prolong the enjoyment.<br /><br />I liked the characters.  Yes, Katsa is violent, but that's part of the horrors inflicted on her by her talent (grace) and her uncle's use of it.  She does struggle to gain mastery over the violence, which is a fight a lot of people can relate to.  I'm often annoyed by characters who are too superhuman, but I could accept her super speed and strength and resistance to the elements, because her grace explained it.  My only critcism is that her character is so well defined at the beginning, but it fades a bit, and she turns more normal.  It's hard to keep up such a strong personality, and she does change and grow during the course of the story, but her changing and the author's relaxing of her personality don't quite match up.<br /><br />I loved Po's casual arrogance and sense of humor.  His grace is intriguing and ethically difficult.<br /><br />The traveling went on a little long, but overall it was the type of book I didn't want to put down.<br /><br />I've read some negative reviews railing on the poor quality of the prose.  Though I participate in several writers' critique groups and find myself not enjoying reading as much anymore, because I tend to pick it apart, I have to admit that I didn't even notice any problems in \\"Graceling.\\"  I was too engrossed in the story.<br /><br />My hesitation in recommending it without warning is Katsa's firmly, almost militantly, anti-marriage philosophy, and her espousing the idea that being unfettered lovers is better.  This is a valid, thought-provoking stance, and I believe it adds to the interestingness of her character, but many people may object to the glorification of premarital relations in a YA novel.  Parents should be aware of this, to open discussions.<br /><br />Robin-hoodish societies, believable magic, fascinating premise, tingling romance:  a great read.
B000SCHBGQ|1.0|I am a big fan of the fantasy genre of books, and I had hear recommendations here and there for The Alchemyst for some time. So when it showed up as a borrowable book on Lendle, I decided to give it a chance. I gave it 40% on my Kindle, and finally decided that the plot was moving too slowly, and the writing was just too poor for me to continue. The idea that Sophie and Josh, the protagonists of the story, go from being normal teenagers to deeply involved in a prophecy they had never heard of before is intriguing, but the interactions between the characters (especially Josh & Sophie) were so unrealistic, as well as characters' reactions to certain events, that I had to stop. Certain words were used repeatedly, and this was quite annoying. I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't do it.
B004XIQIPQ|1.0|Ok, so, looking at the title of the album, i really had low hopes.  I mean, really, juvenile at best.  But i thought to myself, self, this could be good, give it a chance.  Afterall, it was on vinyl in Ireland.  I digress...  so, after hearing the OUTSTANDING track of Don't sit down 'cause i've moved your chair, i realize that artic monkeys are past their apex, if they ever really had one.  Possible the biggest sad sack of stuff i've ever heard.  Hope you like it more than me.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I orginally saw Shelter on youtube after reading After Elton's 100 best gay films list. After I saw the movie I ordered the dvd. This is such an amazing movie about, love, acceptance, and coming of age. The cinematography was breathtaking with the views of the beach and the bridge, left me wanting to take a trip to San Pedro and Laguna beach where the film was shot. This was definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. :)
0385341679|5.0|One thing I noticed from a lot of the readers who weren't as thrilled by Shadowfever as the 345 (at this point) readers who gave Shadowfever 5 stars is they miss Karen's Highlander series. No, this is not a traditional romance, this is something so much more. Don't get me wrong, I love romances. They are my escape but the Fever series captured my imagination like no other book or series has before and I've been an avid reader for more years then I care to comment on.     Shadowfever is the icing on a very delicious cake. I had no idea what was going to happen next, what a treat considering I can almost always guess what's going to happen in a book. Throw your expectations out the door and just hop on for a fantastic journey. You won't regret it, just make sure you start with Darkfever and read the books in order.    I'm thrilled to hear KMM plans on writing more Fever related books because I'm just not ready to give these characters up.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is the best thing that has ever been done on Rome and up there with the greatest TV series that have ever been produced. It covers the reign of Gaius Julius Caeser to the beginning of Augustus's reign. It remains very very entertaining while retaining a great deal of historical accuracy. Seems they had the budget of a regular hollywood movie, maybe that's why they could only keep the series going for two seasons?(HBO is notorious for blowing through huge budgets in no time)Its hard to pick out the greatest aspects of this series. It could be the phenomenal acting performances of the cast or the incredible set design and cinematography or the ability to delve into the life of the peasants from time to time. To this date I have made it through this 22 hour series twice and I plan on watching it many more times in the coming years, it only gets better. Be warned, this is one of those addicting TV shows, once you begin watching you will not be able to stop.    **Review is for the DVD set, I have not seen the Blu-Ray version yet.
0316069353|3.0|The last few entries in Connelly's long-running police procedural series featuring Detective Harry Bosch of the LAPD have, frankly, been pretty weak, as if the author has become as weary of his character as Bosch is of the world in general. Perhaps as an antidote, he began a new series a few years ago, also set in Los Angeles, starring Mickey Haller, a defense attorney (and therefore the natural enemy of the police), known as the \\"Lincoln lawyer\\" because he doesn't maintain an actual office, preferring to do business from the fully-equipped back seat of an armored, bullet-proof Lincoln Town Car while being driven from client to courthouse to police division all over Greater LA. Mickey is a very interesting character, very much a professional who really doesn't need to know whether his clients are guilty or innocent in order to do his constitutional job of defending them in court to the best of his ability. His faith is in the law itself, not those who are charged, rightly or wrongly, with breaking it. (Civilians who vilify lawyers for defending those whom they've already decided -- or assumed -- are guilty simply have zero understanding of the genius of the American legal system.) But times are hard just now, what with the sagging economy and criminals falling back on the public defender system rather than hiring their own attorneys, and Mickey has edged over into the booming field of foreclosure defense to make ends meet. Foreclosure is a very topical subject, of course, with hundreds of thousands of people losing their homes every years in California alone, and it gives Connelly the opportunity of explore (and occasionally pontificate about) the issues. But now one of his foreclosure clients, Lisa Trammel, has been charged with the murder of the vice-president in charge of the home loans department at the bank that holds the note on her house, and Haller finds himself at the center of a media circus. Because Trammel had also founded and built up a protest and resistance organization to fight illegality and fraud in the foreclosure industry -- and there's certainly plenty of that. The reader is immersed in the details of Haller's investigation of the case -- it's a \\"lawyer procedural\\" -- and the strategy and tactics of the trial, all of which is fascinating and far more realistic (and cynical) than Perry Mason. His ex-wife, a talented assistant DA with whom he's still in love, also has a more prominent role than in the past. (He has another ex-wife who now works as his office manager and is married to his chief investigator. Mickey's personal life can get pretty complicated.) In fact, it's a pretty good story right up until the end, when Connelly pulls a very cheap trick, the nature of which I won't reveal, but which any experienced reader of murder mysteries and courtroom novels will not be surprised at. The result is to cast doubt on much of what has gone before in terms of character development. Could Lisa really have been that devious and that great an actress? Especially given Haller's forty years of experience? Yes, a plot twist of some kind was needed at the end to put the reader off balance, but the author opts for the easy way, which is disappointing.stance organization to fight illegality and fraud in the foreclosure industry -- and there's certainly plenty of that.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I beat it for the pc and the DS, this version lacks the Zen Garden and mini game/puzzle modes (so it is very tedious to get all purchases) but for the price of a small coffee, you can't complain
0307454541|4.0|Good book.  I was riveted to the very end. My only issues are that the author doesn't really write the female characters motivations that well. He writes the female characters as if their feelings were the same as men in regards to sex, business, and vengeance. They are not, though I will admit that some of the characteristics of Lisbeth were believable; Harriet, Cecelia, Erika, Anna, Eva, far less so.  Also, if the intent was to bring light to the horrible abuses of women in Sweden and in general; I felt that the circumstances in the novel were too extreme.  They were downright salacious, grotesque and in my mind, gratuitous.  It's unfortunate that the author felt he had to go to such extremes to highlight these issues, though the more brutal and awful the situation is towards women, the more likely people will read it. However I don't think it does anything to educate anyone on the brutalities against women in general. Unfortunate because I think in a vague way, this was in part one of the author's intentions.
B004LWZW42|5.0|First Impressions:<br /><br />Director Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) tones down the violence a bit in this excellent rendition of the origins of the X-Men -- teenagers and young adults who struggle with who they are and their strangeness, unacceptable in society.  Do you protect society or do you embrace your destiny and get rid of the \\"lesser species?\\"<br /><br />I mean with all these differences that it's best to get into a group of like-minded people with similar rejection and upset and also similar goals and purposes.<br /><br />It's a story of two young men and how they deal with their differences.  One, Charles Xavier, who was brought up in a rich household, has known the best schools, the best social status and knows what women are thinking before they can speak.  Wow, the power to be a lady's man, who would'a though?<br /><br />The other end of the spectrum is a young man who in anger can bend steel with his bare brains.  He witnesses the Nazis and their Jewish experimentation including the death of his mother.  And he meets a man, Sebastian, who forms Eric into the image of a true superman.  He discusses not so much the blonde, Aryan look but rather the evolutionary form of Man.  And of course he has the answer:<br /><br />1950s DNA!<br /><br />Use nuclear power to create mutants and thereby get rid of normal people.  A mad plan to say the least -- something out of a 1950s science fiction film.  Remember \\"Them\\" or \\"The Beast of 20,000 Fathoms\\" when monsters rose from nuclear energy?<br /><br />Now before you criticize me for saying the plot for X-Men has more DNA with a 1950s science fiction movie, what saves this film is the acting.  I was convinced that these misunderstood teens really were at the threshold of something greater.<br /><br />The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis was great as a back-drop.<br /><br />The special effects were great with the missiles lobbing here and there.  Professor X figured that once they saved the humans from nuclear war that he would be cheered and helped.  Instead, as Magneto predicted, they would be hunted down and destroyed.<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />Unlike some other comic book films that were so involved in canon that the message got lost amidst the explosions and action, X-Men First Class does several things.  As touched on earlier, the awkward, misunderstood teen rejected by society.  The rich Xavier and the poor Eric, both sharing a commonality despite their differences in class.  The Nazi theme of eugenics morphed into exterminating a perceived threat, a race of men that are considered \\"different.\\"<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />The film was violent enough to satisfy those who like action in their films, but kept within the PG rating -- just!  And the interplay between the characters was interesting and enchanting in many ways.  Finally the scriptwriters wrote for the common viewer rather than catering to the fanboy, although both types of viewers will be enjoying this film.  The film is up there with Batman Begins and Spiderman 2.  Wonderful., they would be hunted down and destroyed.

B002NY731U|5.0|Added this album to my collection because somehow I never purchased it when it came out. This is one of my favorite bands and after listening to Dave's autobiography it reenergized me to see if there was anything I was missing. Purchased it as MP3 album and I am very satisfied.
B004OEMRGI|5.0|Attention all lovers of African music and particularly the \\"desert blues\\"  If you enjoy the fusion of old and new styles that comes out of many African artists, you will be thoroughly intrigued by this album.  Omar's guitar playing skills rival Doueh and Alhabib--I'd even dare say he has a leg up on them--and the song structure and complexity is something to be marveled at.  When I first received this album, I listened to it three times, back-to-back.  I can't recommend this highly enough.    Disclaimer: I am someone who listens to a variety of music from the very loose genre of \\"desert blues\\" so I am writing this album recommendation to those who are already familiar with it.  If you are unfamiliar with this genre, I'd recommend hitting up youtube and checking out Group Doueh, Tinariwen, and Bombino to get a feel of this music before you purchase.
1594202842|1.0|After hearing others talk about the book, I decided to give it a read. Frankly I was quite disappointed. The book does not flow very well as it is series of random recollections of her kids. These recollections have a common element - to glorify her kids, and to a larger degree the author herself. You just have to step back from the drama that was plastered into the stories to see the recurring pattern in the book: kid did not want to practice music - mom makes child practice - kid wins contests & receive rave reviews - all the while mom had to go through heroic effort to get kid to practice. Got kind of old, along with the slogan of \\"Chinese mother,\\" which is so stereotypical and way overused in the book, probably to help sell the book. The storyline pattern repeats itself to reinforce that Chua's kids are superior to the other kids and that all of her sacrifices were for the kids sake. However, to me it is just a sad story of an overbearing parent living vicariously through her kids. The ending was intellectually challenged (yeah, stupid). Chua attempts to make her youngest daughter out to be a hero for arguing back and setting her straight from her many years of error in raising them. Um, having a teenager argue back is ... duh ... normal. So why make such a big deal out of it? It's called adolescence. I guess you need to be more than a law professor to understand that?!  SELF-GLORIFICATION !!!
B004VN5MNC|5.0|This album is awesome.  The Foo Fighters never fail to deliver.  I found the Deadmau5 remix of Rope especially interesting/great!
B00007LTIB|4.0|O.K.; this is not one of Yes's better albums.  Still; it is a much better album then some of their later efforts.  As much as I have always liked this band (top 5) some of their later efforts were real lemons to say the least. That happens to all bands at one time or another.  Patric Moraz took over here for keyboard wiz Rick Wakeman.  Patric Moraz has his own style here and he is no slouch when it comes to tickling the ivorys. This is an interesting album as it Yes in one of their many transitional phases. It's not Close to The Edge or Tales From Topographic Oceans but it is still a very good album. Oh; in case you happen to be new to this band (I sometimes forget how long it's been.)they were one of the many that were labeled progressive rock whatever that means.I prefer to think of them as simply an excellent band.  Often shunned by the critics but then so was another band known as Led Zeppelin.

B004SBB0LU|3.0|Over at Steve Hoffman's forum, people say these aren't that compressed, but they are!!  I looked at the Prophet's Song and Bohemian Rhapsody from A Night at the Opera, which is supposedly one of the better remasters.  The offline TT Dynamic Range Meter (look it up) says that the original EMI CD has 50% more dynamic range for Bohemian Rhapsody, and a third more (33%) dynamic range for the Prophet's Song.  Whoever says these aren't compressed is just plain wrong, or doesn't know what to listen (or look) for.    These are also have boosted bass and highs vs. the old EMI CDs too.  The highs don't bother me as much, but the lows just don't sound natural at all.  The original EMI CDs sound better across the board.  I do like the bonus tracks though, hence the 3 star and not 1 star rating.  :-)  Ironically enough, the bonus tracks sound better mastered than the core albums.  The bonus tracks sound more balanced and organic than the albums themselves to me.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|While waiting for this pre-ordered BluRay to arrive (nervously pacing back and forth in front of the mailbox for 3 weeks straight), I was hoping and praying for an excellent BluRay experience - both a good transfer to disc and a good restoration process. Being well aware of what the best of BluRay can offer, and in view of the fact that this has, for so long now, remained with me as one of my all-time favorite films, I just didn't know if I would be able to stand it if the whole thing had somehow proven to be below par. But from my first glimpse of the remarkable hues, details and textures of that very first, opening and dramatically iconic, full-height pan of the imposing visage of Woody Strode, standing there, motionless in the doorway of that isolated and dusty train depot, I could tell that in all likelihood I was in store for something special - and, as it turned out, indeed I was from beginning to end. This disc has an extrordinarily film-like quality to it - the level of which is rather astonishing and it is infinitely pleasing and rewarding to find this sort of viewing experience associated with a film of this caliber (not always the case with BluRay) - but, both picture AND sound are top notch! I haven't even soaked in all the extras yet, but I really don't care - this transfer of this movie is itself all that and a bag of chips! What a treat it is to feel, with each and every scene, that you are finally seeing and hearing (so much of it as if for the first time) everything the filmmakers wanted you to! All of it only serves to enhance the indeed emotional, dramatic and cinematic depths of, without a doubt, one of the finest westerns ever made - from the rugged coarseness of up-close, more-than-3-day-old beard stubble, to the expansive openness and bell-like clarity of the magnificently sweeping shots of Monument Valley, to the inspired metaphoric use of the slow, rhythmic and (enhanced to new, virtually chest-thumping levels) deathly laboring chuffs and puffs of an idling locomotive - all equally unforgettable. And in fact you can't pass up, as well, the memorably mythological dialogue and cinematography, both so entrancingly paced, that is within and IS this film - or, as I believe it was once put before: \\"the poetic myth of it all, and all of it poetic myth\\". Yes sir, any way you care to slice it, sitting down to view THIS BLURAY presentation of Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is an event.

This latest installment in the Harry Potter movie series not only lived up to my expectations, it exceeded them by a movie mile.  As always, this movie perfectly blended both action and dialog to captivate and entertain me throughout.      Harry Potter movies are always fantastic, but Deathly Hallows Part 1 is even better.  It IS a bit sad that there is only one more movie in the works, but hey.  Something to look forward to next year, right?  POTTER POWER FOREVER!

B004JVXTL8|1.0|What do I think of this movie, you ask? A complete and utter snooze fest! I can honestly say the only thing that kept me from dozing off was the intermittent shrieks from the teenaged girls in the audience. Scariest movie ever made? What a knee slapper! The plot of this film was almost non existent since 90% of the entire thing was just afterhour footage of the pool, the bedroom and the dog. Sure there was a startling moment here or there but being startled is completely different from being scared. The only scary part of this entire hogwash of a movie is how this trend of homemade-video-movie hybrid crap will keep rearing it's ugly head in theaters. Trust me, you will have more fun watching Al Gore's \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\".

B004DNWPY4|3.0|This book is okay, but it is completely repetitive from one chapter to the next. The SAME INFORMATION is REPEATED over and over again in every chapter. No new information is presented to the reader. The only thing this book tells the reader is: \\"Wanna be a millionaire? Be frugal with all of your purchases, and save/invest 33% of what you earn instead of spending.\\" THAT'S IT. There are NO OTHER INSIGHTS TO BE GAINED IN THIS ENTIRE BOOK. It is rather disappointing, because the authors could have given specific advice on how to save better, how to invest better, or how to live more frugally. Instead, it is just one anecdote after another about fictional people who either ARE frugal or AREN'T frugal. I was really hoping for much more insight than a one-sentence thesis repeated ad naseum. I mean, I am not joking here... every single chapter is EXACTLY THE SAME as the chapter that precedes it. It's like those essays that 3rd graders are supposed to write when their teacher tells them to write a 10-page essay, but the kids have no idea how to fill 10 pages, so they just repeat the same information but try to change up the words a little bit on each page to make it sound different. That's what's going on in this book... this would have made a much better magazine article than a book, because it only has about 3 pages of insights.

0446364495|5.0|When a woman is deeply loved by a the man, that she is meant to be loved, bonding between the two will never end. Waller has sweetly, quietly, beautifully and in a normal daily way, captured this concept of love. Robert Kinkaid is not looking for one night stands, although he could have had a few. He is unique and special - so is Francesca Johnson - farmer's wife, mother of two and long ago from Naples. Bridges of Madison Country tells a beautiful story in a normal sort of a way. Love is woven into every day things - washing a cup, taking out the beer mugs, opening a brandy bottle or pulling out carrots for dinner. Love overpowers Francesca and everything she does for Robert becomes love. Guilt has no place in this sort of love. It is all consuming and all encompassing. A treasure to hold in anyone's library. Certainly in mine. Thank you Amazon.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|I was amazed at how great this inexpensive cup/accessory holder worked. We rented a stroller for Disney that did not have a cup holder, but knew we would need something. So, I didn't want to spend a lot of money on it. It held two medium fountain drinks (or two cans of soda) as well as our maps, camera and sunsreen. It's very flexible and packs easily too. Note that it's made for a single stroller but can be used on a double stroller as long as there is a middle bar to affix the velcro end onto.Cup holder areas are elastic, while the end pieces are velcro. I will probably use this on my umbrella stroller at home now.
0679720200|5.0|Albert's Masterpiece is an excellent example of the absurdist point of view...benign indifference. my favorite part of the novel is when she asks him to marry her and he says it doesnt really matter. it is both comedic and a serious read. I even used this novel on my AP Literature test for one of my essays in which i analyzed the portrayal of justice in the novel. there is so much to analyze!!! of course my review does not do justice to this novel, one must read it before they can fully grasp the concept of a good novel.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The original Deathly Hallows book is so filled with details and stories I'm amazed that they could do the movie in only two parts. Like all of the Potter movies much detail content is sacrificed going to film from the total \\"read the book\\" story. I'm not sure the viewer who has not read the books first will follow all of the nuances first introduced.  That said, its great to see the wowser visuals on screen. I'm ready for part two.

I have a phone internet plan with 15Mb/s connection speeds but I have to download this very large app over wifi?      So I pose the question to Amazon again...    Are you kidding me?       For such an innovative and groundbreaking website I feel kind of silly dealing with nonsense like this.

B004KSQN7C|5.0|I can't say more than what any others have said about Britney's \\"Femme Fatale.\\"  What I can add, though, is that I believe this is her best work since \\"Britney\\" in 2001 with \\"Slave 4 U.\\"  The songs are so reminiscent of the girly party beats that were common to her repertoire before her emotional breakdown and subsequent (allbeit unfortunate) release of \\"Blackout\\" before she was really ready to be back in the limelight.  I am so impressed with how catchy all of the songs are.  The beats do not disappoint, and the lyrics, although topical and devoid of personal branding, are Britney without a doubt.  I read another review discuss how little this album reveals of Britney as a person; perhaps that is part of her intrigue.  The enigma who continues to escape us album after album, Ms. Britney Spears.
1439102724|3.0|I like the author, but think that when she churns out a book every year she looses something in the telling of a story. This was an OK read, but I would not recommend it - rather formulaic and the characters are not well developed.

0553386794|3.0|Don't get me wrong, the plot and the descriptions in this book were amazing. But there were so many characters I didn't know which was which. And by the end I kind of stopped caring. My biggest complaint though is that the first chapter is the most interesting but the creatures in it are never to be found again in the whole book. Don't know if I'm going to buy the rest of the series or not.
B000056N8X|5.0|The final of a timeless story The Highlander.  I loved all episodes of this story.  The ethics and philosopy throughout the story make this much more than just a story about violence.

B004XIQIPQ|5.0|The Monkeys debut LP's claim to greatness was derived from the ability of Alex Turner to deliver a certain cleverness, a unique obsession to detail, and British cheek that on one level told the story of a drunken night in Sheffield from the viewpoint of twenty one year old locals. The story progressed in the critiques of their subsequent albums \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" and \\"Humbug\\", with the main focus of the reviews of critics being Turner's lyricism. With \\"Suck It and See\\" Turner's lyrics were my initial reasoning that this is indeed the group's best album, but after several dozen listens I have come to realize what makes their new album my favorite album of 2011 is not that Alex Turner has earned the title of the premier lyricist of current music, but that the band as a whole has hit their peak.<br /><br />\\"She Thunderstorms\\" presents drummer Matt Helders making his presence first known on the album in a signature pounding, attacking drum lead in. Critically, Helders has been praised for his drumming talent and seems to be the most respected member of the band(other than Turner) in regards to musicianship as his drumming has been a Monkey cornerstone that drove the energy of past albums. The first surprise of \\"Suck It and See\\" is that the sheer power of Helders arrival flows seamlessly into a more reserved, groove oriented style. The refinement and maturation of Helders' percussion work has allowed bassist Nick O'Malley to reveal his technical skills have advanced the furthest of any member's instrumental talents. Matt Helders has always been a great drummer, but this is the first album O'Malley has proved to be a great bassist. \\"Reckless Serenade\\" is a prime example of the two's offerings being key to a near perfect song. Their combined talents serve as a rhythm section that ties the album together from beginning to end, bringing to mind the best of 60's pop studio musicians, The Smiths, and the Stone Roses.<br /><br />The sheer scale of Turner's lyrics gives way to the deduction that the album is a place where Jamie Cook has become the leader of guitar direction and sound. Without Humbug's Homme drone and desert haze, Cook shows a newly found inventiveness fueled by influence from The Jesus and Mary Chain, Johnny Marr, and contemporaries The Horrors.<br /><br />This musical growth sets a wondrous stage for the real show, Turner. Having worked through the convoluted, often meaningless lyrics of Humbug's weaker moments, Alex proves himself to be a master of the pop song. He loves, he lusts, he uses incredibly obscure metaphors. He has carved himself a permanent place in the great songwriters of Britain. Upon the rock solid foundation of the band, Turner draws influence from all over the map. The music's platform allows him to draw from Johnny Cash, Brian Wilson, and LCD Soundsystem. Combine this direction with his obsession with weather, and we're given tunes like the title track \\"Suck It and See\\" and \\"Love is a Laserquest\\". \\"That's not a skirt girl that's a sawed off shotgun, and I can only hope you've got it aimed at me\\" croons Turner on the title track. As to the sheer weirdness of the above quote, don't worry, there's plenty more where that came from. To say the least, this is a good thing.<br /><br />In 2011 we saw two bands that shared very similar rises to fame release their fourth albums. The Strokes' \\"Angles\\" found a bunch of individuals trying to take the album in their own direction, resulting in a disjointed disappointment and a strong sign that the Strokes truly have seen their peak. On the other hand Arctic Monkeys made their best album, the best album of 2011, and a work that will surely be ranked highly on some NME \\"Best Album\\" List twenty years from now. Suck It and See is great because it is aware of it strengths and weaknesses. This album takes risks, brings smiles, stirs up regret, beautifies lust, and makes me personally consider take chances where I wouldn't of before. As much as it pains me to sayit, maybe the NME was right from the start this time. 5/5m the start this time. 5/5
B00127RAJY|4.0|My wife and I added this to our running and core fitness regiment.  Neither of us are completely \\"fit\\", but we like to run.    The workouts are hard!  Which is mostly good.  They are also short, so busy people like us can fit them in.  Each one is just over 20 minutes.  You warm up first for a couple of minutes (very important), and then you do 3 circuits that are each 6 minutes, and then you cool down/stretch for  a couple of minutes.      Each 6 minute circuit is broken down into 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs.  It's good total body exercise.  The strength portion usually incorporates upper and lower body at the same time (for instance, you might to lunges and raise your dumbells to shoulder or eye level at the same time).      My wife is able to do push ups now.  She never thought she would!    We've both definately dropped weight in the last 3 weeks also.  So there are results.    My caution is for people who have had injuries:    I've had problems with my lower back for several years now.  I think I over-strained in level 2 and needed to visit the chiropractor.  This concern isn't unique to Jillian's video.  Many exercise video's use exercises that are not good in terms of back support, and the physical trainer at my chiropractor told me that even perfectly fit people can and do throw their backs out if they exercise that way.    Also, I tend to get shin splints and in the cardio portion in particular (but also because of the some of the exercises in the strength portion) you 'hammer' the calves with jumping jacks, jump rope, and other exercises that put a lot of strain on the calves.      If you have week knees, there are some exercises that would put excess strain on them as well.    Of this to say, if you have injuries, be careful.  You may need to seek medical advise prior to doing these exercises.      The do build strength (if done so you don't injure yourself) and they do work to burn off fat.
0316098329|5.0|I finished this book a couple of weeks ago and held off reviewing it until I was able to think about it a bit.<br /><br />Reading from the perspective of the child (Jack) took a little getting used to. It wasn't until I was 1/3 of the way through it that I realized that even the boy's mother (Ma) was still a child, she never had a chance to grow into an adult. The total isolation of the space known simply as \\"Room\\" wasn't the same space to Jack as it was to his mother. Jack thought of it as a place for endless imagination, Ma thought of it as a prison where \\"Old Nick\\" kept and abused her.<br /><br />The first half or so of the book covers the life of Jack and Ma in room and their life together, it's a fairly quiet opening that allows you to get into the somewhat strange narrative style and understand the life that Ma has tried to build for Jack.<br /><br />The second half of the book starts off almost like an adventure when they make a break from Old Nick and then melds nicely into an almost different novel, this time a character study. It's a fascinating transformation of style, while Jack still narrates the entire tone of the book shifts as Jack and Ma adjust to their new life.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, it's not one that I'm going to forget anytime soon.
B004UA8D1O|4.0|Sry for all you Camron haters, But this True story, told a great story of A dive that went wrong in 3D, The 3D in this movie ROCKS the HOUSE!!! The lighting of a camron movie is what this movie needed and got that respect on my opinion!!! I do not like to tell anyone the story, i would rather someone find out for themselves if they like or dislike the movie, so i will not point out any scenes!!! This whole movie from Begining to End was in 3D and Fantastic looking, The Water sometimes looked like it was flowing right onto my lap!!! There are spotts in this movie that are clostraphobic, \\"of corse, it is a cave movie\\"  this movie gets 4 stars in my book!!! this movie is deffinitly worth the watch if your not \\"clostraphobic\\"
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is more of an opinion than a review as I agree thoroughly with those who have offered up rave reviews of this work. I feel so strongly about the strength and content of this recording that I could not help but comment. On this effort Derek, Susan and their bandmates are a match made in heaven! I find Susan's voice to be so spiritual and calming. Her husband Derek's slide guitar playing is unriveled by anyone in music today. My thanks to all who were involved in making this a musical masterpiece!

I have been a purely avocational volunteer marketer for not-for-profit performing arts groups for some time and have been watching the increasing inefficiency of the old methods and assumptions.  I have only recently jumped into the deep end of the social media pool only recently.  With my head still going under now and then, your book is a real life-preserver.  It both provided a context in which I can continue my self-education and validity for that most important realization, the primacy of the word-of-mouth exchange as the ultimate marketing tool and how that translates into today's electronic communication.   BTW..the Appendices were really helpful.  AWESOME! Thanks!

B00065LY1I|5.0|After attending Kylie's amazing Aphrodite North American concert tour, this awesome 2-CD compliation supplements the setlist that includes the latest Aphrodite CD hits performed during her 2011 Les Follies show.  This is the best audio substitution to own all the while before the release of Kylie's Aphrodite Les Follies Tour DVD.  However, the setlist performed live in concert far exceeds musically with updated arrangements including the range and depth of Kylie's vocal delivery compared to the CD versions.  Still, this compilation CD is an absolute must for all Kylie fans!

0385341679|1.0|I found this book at a bookstore earlier this year and the synopsis sounded intriguing.  While I'm not a huge fan of this genre I enjoy most vampire stories and I guess that's what I was really expecting.  After realizing there were four other books I ordered them and settled in to read what I thought would be an exciting series (my step-sister in law was excited for me to read them and just loved every book).  The first book was good BUT as I got further into the series I realized the author just wasn't able to keep up with her own imagination and fell short of creating and writing a strong storyline.  Mac is thrust into a situation that was unfamiliar to her and yet she is arrogant and behaves like a young teenager.  Barrons is written as a strong intense man who we find out is thousands of years old YET he falls in love with Mac????  Dani became my favorite character because as a young girl she was the only one who seemed to be written age appropriately and consistent and then Moning goes and throws a wammy that was completely ridiculous.  While the premise for this story is great I just don't think the author spent enough time developing the characters or storyline.  By the end of the series it felt like Moning just started throwing stuff into the story (like the Dani situation and Mac's sudden \\"dreams\\" of the house).  If you don't usually read this genre don't waste your time or money.
B004TLM284|5.0|Not much to say here except that this is a fantastic pop record. Every song is catchy and upbeat.  It'll put you in a great mood and get you pumped for a night out with friends.  Listen to it in the car, in the club, at the beach, or by the pool. Great summer album!  There are no \\"filler\\" songs on this album.
0553381695|2.0|A Game of Thrones was a very good book.  I cannot believe he killed Ned Stark in the very first book.  The only reason I started watching the HBO series was because they had the unbelievable wisdom to make Sean Bean Ned Stark. A more perfect Lord of Winterfell there could not be.  But now he's dead and I still have 2,000 pages to read. <sigh>  Tyrion Lannister is by far THE most interesting character in this second book.  Daenaerys is pretty interesting, too, and far more scary than the Lannisters.  Gods help the Seven Kingdoms when she lands back in Westeros.  But Tyrion is actually trying to right grievous wrongs and you have to admire the little man for his efforts.  Don't know where his efforts will land him, but it's an interesting ride.  I know this is a Medieval-like world and that's what fantasy is, but there is so much darkness and evil and so little light and hope and good.  Really......not even a glimmer of good and hope. That's what makes Tolkien better - much tragedy and death in Middle Earth, but he gives us the Elves and their beauty and wisdom and magic.  Summer and ShaggyDog need to be set free.  I have a really good idea of what awaits behind the Wall and I don't know if I have the heart to read it. This is a grim, unrelenting book.  Would it hurt to lighten it up some??
0345529057|5.0|Read this since day one, love the fact that it is unpredictable as when major characters (who seem groomed to be the high king) die in minor unpredictable plot points. Even when you have followed them for a book and a half!    Complex evolving plot and people who are partially good and bad.    Interesting that many of these things I like are the negative comments others make.    1. If you like your stories predictable, this is not the series for you.  2. If you like your characters black and white, this is not the series for you.  3. If you don't like your characters to evolve (or, it could be argued, to have new characteristics revealed), this is not the series for you.    I've read thousands of Sci-Fi and Fantasy books and this series ranks right up there with the first Dune novel and is better overall because the sequels are better than the Dune sequels.    Worst thing - 11 years between the fourth and fifth novels? Really? George will likely die before this is finished and someone else will need to finish it. Just saying, be warned!
1582406723|5.0|ROBERT KIRKMAN'S \\"WALKING DEAD: DAYS GONE BY\\"  (A REVIEW)    Once upon a time I was one of those women that was scared to death of zombies and I wouldn't even watch anything that had them on it. I didn't want to see pictures I would turn my head in disgust and literally run away almost screaming at the sight. I think deep down it was always the thought of 'what if' that kept me from wanting to have anything to do with a genre that is becoming rapidly more popular. Those days ended when my husband decided we were going to watch \\"The Walking Dead\\" on AMC.    I was instantly hooked, and it really had nothing to do with the zombies as much as it did the humanity of the people that were still living. The books are no different. Having read the first one in a series I can honestly say I intend to seek them all out one by one.  You get a feeling of what it would truly be like to live through such a horrible plague and discover that you are perhaps one of the last living people on the planet. There is emotion, turmoil, truth and sincerity in these graphic novels as well as the show on television.    You soon even begin to feel sorry for those that have been turned and you have to ask yourself what you would do if that happened to someone in your family. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm not as horrified by the zombies as I once was. Robert Kirkman has done a phenomenal job and I can only hope he'll continue with the story for as long as he can.    -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club    Read more: [...]
1400095204|5.0|Being a member of a writing group has one disadvantage.  While improving my own writing, my critical senses have become finely honed. As a result, I'm not as content with what I read as I once was.  Several books I've read of late just didn't satisfy.  Then I picked up Half of a Yellow Sun.  Not only is the story good, the book is so well constructed, it seems as though it could be Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's own story, that these were people she actually knew.  The book satisfies.    The story takes place in Nigeria in the sixties.  It guides us into the comfortable lives of intellectuals and entrepreneurs prior to the Biafran war, at first hinting of things to come, then leading us through the war until its conclusion in 1970.  It gradually builds, initially showing us details of everyday life in Nigeria until we feel the full horror of the war.      The principle characters are two sisters who grew up in an affluent Nigerian family, their partners, and a houseboy.  One of the sisters, the beautiful Olanna, is in love with Odenigbo, a socialist professor.  Ugwu, who becomes a houseboy for the professor, represents the laboring class.  Olanna's sister, Kainene, a cynical, successful businesswoman, becomes involved with Richard, a naïve journalist who is infatuated with all things African.  During the course of the story, seemingly flawless people become flawed and compromised.  By the end, everyone will have betrayed someone.  At times it is heartbreaking to read of the dangers endured, both morally and physically.  But, we cheer for those who manage to overcome.  Some become compassionate where they were once hard and shallow, while others fail to grow, retreating into self-centeredness. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie presents a broad spectrum of people, from the houseboy and his family, to those inhabiting the upper echelons of politics.      The pace of Half of a Yellow Sun never slows.  In heavy passages, there are sudden touches of irony, which then push on to highly emotional scenes.  Achibie deftly uses irony to show us class discrepancy in an idealistic socialist household.      Ugwu came to clear the table.  \\"Get me some brandy, my good man,\\" Odenigbo said.  \\"Yes, sah.\\"    Half of a Yellow Sun is over 400 pages. Achibie takes her time leading the reader into this rich world.  But when I finished the book, I felt as if I had gained insight into life as it was lived in Nigeria in the 1960s.
0061353248|5.0|Dan Ariely makes many interesting points in this book and backs them up with research that he has done throughout the years at MIT and various other universities around the country. A lot of these points made a lot of sense to me and I feel like I knew them, but it was great to see that some actual research was done on these topics. This book is very well-written and easy to read. So if you're interested in the \\"hidden forces that shape our decisions,\\" this is a fantastic book to read. Below is my outline of the book and what you'll be learning about if you choose to read it. Enjoy.   -Relativity and its effect on rational choices- Why we like to choose something similar, but slightly better vs. different, but just as good?  -The more we have, the more we want - \\"I don't want to lice the life of a Boxster, because when you get a Boxster you wish you had a 911, and you know what people who have 911s wish they had? They wish they had -a Ferrari\\"  -First impressions (of people and items) influence expectations on the future. Ex. Remembering that our gas was once $1 a gallon.  -Getting paid to do something makes it work, and people hate work.   -Prices and Changes--> Effects on people long-term and short-term.  -Free is always enticing. Always.  -More money= More motivation, Less money= Less motivation, No money= Also more motivation  -Keep social domain away from market norms.   -Social norms and the Burning Man experience.  -Why do we make impulsive decisions in an excited state?  -Prevention of impulsive decisions in excited state.   -Procrastination and tools for self-control.   -Automatic attachment to things we own/are given.   -Consequences of temporary ownership.  -Too many options/opportunites become distractions/obsticles.   -Consequences of indecisiveness.   -Anticipation and its effects on expectations/opinions in reality.  -How key words or numbers affect thinking (short-term).  -Key words/ideas affecting honesty and integrity (Oaths and benchmarks).  -Morebenefit than cost = \\"Free Lunch\\"
B001GCUO16|4.0|I had read the graphic novel Wolverine Origins some years ago . I thought it was one of the better graphic novels out there . Having written that , agreed , this film has absolutely nothing in common with it . I sure like the cast and story though . To me , Ryan Reynolds (THE PROPOSAL) was very funny and a real scene stealer with his mercenary character and beyond (he may well have stolen a good portion of this film) . Not an easy thing to accomplish in this field of fine actors . I enjoyed all the guys in that crew . I'm a huge fan of Danny Huston (JOHN ADAMS , THE NUMBER 23 , 30 DAYS OF NIGHT , EDGE OF DARKNESS and so on) . Hugh is , well , Hugh . I've really enjoyed his various performances and this one is no exception . I like the unintentionally funny shots as well as the humorous script . I like this dark but flawed story a good deal . Sad stuff happens . It's wrenching . If you like any or all of the folks involved , give it a try on BLU-ray . At least Red Box it . It's great entertainment , to my mind . Oh , and its got the always excellent Liev Shreiber in a juicy role he really sinks his teeth into . Zero is fun . There again , i like the whole cast . Check it out .
0451169514|3.0|fell apart when they started to confront IT, IT did not seem a completely constructed concept, as if King was making up his powers and vulnerabilities as he went along and as needed to progress the story.  The kids (and adults) went in completely unprepared, IT was ultimately pretty weak/underwhelming, overuse of crutch elements like racism, psycho bullies, abusive fathers/husbands, etc.     But the storytelling and character building in the first half was fantastic.

B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are the best cooking utensils I have purchased in a long time!  They are sturdy, easily stand up in the pan while you cook if you want.  Best part is they really do keep things from dripping on your countertop!(of course you do have to shake the spoon off first)  I initially got just a spoon, but quickly ordered the set.  They seem to take up more space in my utensil holder, so had to get one with a larger diameter for all of them to fit.  *(Of note:  I got the 5 in 1 utensil, and was not as happy with it; needless utensil.  And the elevated tongs are \\"thick\\" and I have a hard time getting them to grip items so they don't drop.  Also the plastic lock button is stiff to use with one hand.  I prefer my old metal one.)

0756951410|4.0|The Lovely Bones. It became popular due to the movie, but many people do have mixed opinions on it.     For starters, the book does have some pretty graphic scenes in it, a few of which were relatively unnecessary, but one or two that were entirely relevant- either way, I don't think this is a book to hand to anyone under 13, but it's definitely worth reading. For me, I loved the messages it carried about life and letting go of things- and I thought it was a very interesting perspective to take on, as not many books are from the point of view of a dead character. It is a bit slow though, with not much activity happening at once, and it ended up taking me about two months to read just because it was so hard to power through. When I finally did finish it, though, I burst into tears. The ending is so anticlimactic and yet so powerful. The whole novel mainly focuses on the topic of how people will forget about you eventually once you're gone, and how they most likely won't spend every day mourning or even remembering you- and whilst this is a tough pill to swallow, I feel the way Sebold wove in this idea was beautiful, showing the gradual progression of both Susie and how she matures even whilst dead, and the maturing of her family who are learning to deal with their grief down on Earth.     All in all, it's not my favourite, but I definitely liked it, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants an unorthodox read.

B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have a few words for anyone who hasn't heard this album yet:  Prepare yourself for an all-out pop/metal assault.    Interesting how this album hit me.  It started with the obviously catchy title track Born This Way and Judas, then absolutely hit me in the face with tracks like Scheisse, Americano and Edge Of Glory.    Then the fun began, because songs like Bad Kids, Hair (what a chorus!), Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) and Heavy Metal Lover started burrowing into my mind with catchy hooks and incredible beats.  It gets to the point where, as you start to cool to a song that was your favorite for a while, another moves to the front as a favorite.    Lady Gaga has, with the help of Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow, successfully blended elements of heavy metal, eurodisco, Springsteen-based rock vocals, and her own kind of outrageous-ness into an unforgettable album.    If you like pop/rock music, this album is a complete blast to experience, and nearly impossible to get tired of.  Obviously everyone has different tastes and favorites, but this was the pattern for me.    And yes, the bonus tracks are worth the money.
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|While the acting in this movie is good, and there are a few rather poignant scenes, the movie goes nowhere, there are no revelations, no surprises and nobody develops as a character. It's boring, uninspired, and I ended the movie feeling like I had wasted my time. Some parts of the movie were left so vague that it bordered on the absurd. Im glad I didn't pay to watch it in the theater. Hereafter actually reminds me of Inception in its pretending to be something profound and meaningful when it is actually just a bunch of fluff. So, 2 stars, but it gets a big fat 8 on my Eyes Wide Shut scale of lameness. Make another Bourne movie, Matt. Don't waste your time on this crap.
B002VRZEYM|2.0|I had heard it would change the way I looked at food. I got 1 hour into it and quit watching it. I thought it was boring and not that mind-blowing.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I loved it. In the words of my wife \\"it was better than the original, which dosen't take much.\\" Beautiful visuals, good soundtrack (even for someone who hates techno), and a halfway decent story. You might want to brush up on the original, but it's not necessary.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is exciting and includes every element a good novel should, but the value of the trilogy is not only a good story, it's value lies on a story that talks about courage, human nature and dehumanization of others, survival, manipulation, opression, kindness and love.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|This is an amazing game. If you fondly remember the BBS days, then this game is a perfect fit for your. This game borrows elements from Trade Wars 2002, Outpost Trader or Planets: The Exploration of Space to create a perfect game. While at first you will create one captain and stick with him, you will quickly want to create more so you can try out the different classes. It is like a different game for each one. I highly recommend it.
0345529057|5.0|I was about to buy the same set in a store and it was $36! They were at my house in only 2 days after I ordered! I did the cheap 3-5 day shipping and they obviously arrived faster. They were in great condition and I'm already on book too and I just got the books over a week ago. I love love love these books! I'm also watching the HBO series as well and they have stayed pretty close to the books so far.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Like the title says, they did a pretty good job with this one. They provide some nice features in addition to being an app front end for a mobile website you could just as well use. I like how it streamlines searching for things, but it could be a little more easy to access things like saved searches.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This by far one of the best games I have for my android phone!  I cant play enough of this game.
B004G6009K|5.0|You'll read all sorts of things about this movie. Choose to believe anything you wish. But...if you just want to see 3D that will give you a whole new understanding of what 2011 technology is all about, want to see some incredible definition and a plot that is so simple and easy and heartwarming and...then this movie is exquisite.<br />When something like this comes along, you run... not walk ... to get it.<br />Really makes you think about the wonders that will be coming in the future.<br />Oh, and, this is a movie that will not embarrass you, if anyone walks in while you're watching it.
0694003611|2.0|This book is much lauded, but makes little sense. There's a creepy old lady whispering \\"hush\\" and an intentionally blank page, and half the pictures are boring, tiny renderings in black and white. Do not recommend.
