0763644765|5.0|I love this book.  More importantly my 21 month old LOVEs this book.  I got it for him when he was about 15 months and showed an interest in the toilet. I have not been planning to try potty training him until he is much older (closer to three) but I also thought I should take his lead and encourage whatever interest he has. So I found a soft toddler ring to go on our toilet for now to allow him to sit comfortably on it for as long as he likes (or as much time as we have.)<br /><br />He always wants this book. We also have The Potty Book for Boys by Alyssa Satin Capucilli which may work better for him when he is a bit older. Right now it is too wordy for him. The simplicity of Potty is perfect for someone his age. It is almost all about the pictures but we add our own words to elaborate as needed and just have FUN with this.<br /><br />There are a few pages I tend to pass over quickly and one was OOO MMMM HAA EEEE until he started to anticipate it and say UMMHEEE with big smiles. So that has become a must. When we get to the page where everyone falls asleep he makes a snoring sound which amuses us both. But hands down his two favorite pages are What's That? which compels him to make the most excited O shape to his mouth and raise his eyebrows as high as he can while he moves his head back and forth between looking at the picture and looking at me. And of course...UNDIES! which he says with much gusto and then points to each pair in an arbitrary sequence saying \\"undies\\" or sometimes describing what is on them.<br /><br />He gets so excited about this book and everything about it is simple and positive. He is my first and I cannot claim to have any idea what I am doing. It will be another year most likely before I even think about working on training him....BUT he may just get there before me, and if so I honestly believe the fun we have with this book has much to do with it. This has helped to make the bathroom a really positive experience so far, and I feel like weare on a good path.
B000002H6C|5.0|I never had this in cd format cause for some reason my cassettes of this album always disappeared, so I finally broke and got it and man I am so happy I did it is awesome and it got here quickly and in way better condition that I thought it would be.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could have read another book in this series.  And she about Gale?<br />It would be nice if the children where some how made leaders.
B000002LRX|5.0|I had this cd before when I lived in Germany , I bought this cause it was Faith No More , I had no idea how good it was I was very happy with it but I lost it. So I looked on Amazon and found it for a good price and it came and was in better shape than it was advertised. So happy with my purchase.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Anyone and everyone should read this book.<br />Its very well written and it opens a perspective on anotjer side of the world that americans take for granted everyday.<br /><br />I complain about school and the cost all the time and just startig college I came across Malala as she has been nominated for the novel piece prize. After watxhing some interviews of her I went to buy the book eager for more of her story and how she became such a symbol for education in pakistan and peace activist.<br /><br />I always knew education was important but reading this book made me more inspired to learn and go to school. Her st
B00BATG18K|4.0|I found this to be an enjoyable book with a strong story-line. It keeps the reader hooked.The characters have a believable mix of good and bad points. The socio-historic backdrop provides further interest.I didn't rate it as five as the final third of the book appeared a bit rushed, as if the author decided, I'd better finish this off now. At any rate, it was a good read from start to finish.
B00338QENI|4.0|Really interesting book that took place in the fifties when patient comfidentialty wasnt as steong as it is today. Its unbelievable what this paticular family went through because of her mothers cells. I woild reccommend reading this book to anyone in the medical field or interested in history. Really worth the read.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Danny D kicks ass and outstanding satire on<br />Evil of Oil Industry even from the start..<br />Filmed and acted as all films should be..(ie: Paul Dano..)
B000BTC5LW|3.0|Pink Floyd founding members Nick Mason & Richard Wright along with guitarist David Glimour team up with another dozen or so musicians to bring you their 2nd &#34;live&#34; CD after as many tours. This time around the setlist features music from &#34;Division Bell&#34; and their 1973 mega-successful &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; played in their entirety in addition to their most popular classic rock staples. Before the release of the immersion sets this was the first time that we could hear these songs in digital 5 channel surround.<br /><br />For my money, I like &#34;Roger Waters In the Flesh&#34; live DVD better.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have no complaints as of yet. I have been using this so for months and it works great. Could not ask for more.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|MAME (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulation) front end with individual  games downloadable from iTunes/Amazon etc.<br /><br />As a person who was never afraid to help a frog across the street, or save a princess from an angry dragon, I relish the chance to play my favorite coin-op games on long plane rides or slow moving lines at the grocery store.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This, by far, Is my favorite Star Trek movie to date. This is an action packed DVD that you'll have a hard time not watching over and over. Grab the popcorn and a seat and enjoy!
B00ECR7KX2|4.0|You can tell all involved had a lot of fun with this. Nathan Fillion and Alexis Denisov steal the show (in a good way). Joss Whedon is exactly what my Shakespeare needed.
0399255370|5.0|You will enjoy this book! My kids love it! I can't stop smiling when I read it! I highly recommend it & this seller!
B008JFUR10|5.0|Everything I ever wanted in an action movie - giant robots, giant monsters, a multiracial cast, a badass heroine, and a love story that you really could just choose to ignore. Obviously a really well thought-out world. Even the &#34;minor&#34; characters have back story. You don't really get into all of it in the course of the movie, but you can tell they have depth. Love, love, love. Oh, and the theme is now my ringtone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is a different perspective of the WWII and the horrors on both sides.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Genius, I say! A fabulously intricate, detailed world, but Scott Lynch doesn't trip over himself trying to explain it to you. There's no hang up on exposition. Instead he treats the reader like an intelligent human being and the world is revealed through a fast-paced, complex plot with high-stakes cons and clever characters. Quite violent at times, this is not for the faint of heart. Big props for highly imaginative torture scenes - I thought I had read it all, and then this came along. So thrilled there are sequels.
B003VNKNDM|5.0|why spend a lot of money if you are only storing pictures etc. when this item certainly fills the bill.....go for it.
B0098VYE4U|3.0|It was an interesting premise and well acted. The turn of the story regarding the acting troupe was like a bizarre acid trip or bad dream sequence. That is when the story lost it for me.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|Ashton Kutcher was instantly believable as Steve Jobs. The story itself was a fascinating glimpse into the history of Apple.
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|A very disappointing move. Was led to belive the whole story was based upon Annebelle the possessed doll when in fact only the beginning of the movie is about Annebelle instead it takes off to a whole other story about some witch who sold her soul to the devil. This movie is suppose to be based on a true story but i do not belive it is witchs do not belive in the devil or satan so this is bull. I know cause i am a real witch I hope someone will make a movie about Annebelle
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My baby loved these! They were perfect for when he was little and they soothed him to sleep because of their design. I recommend!
B005CWRB44|5.0|very bright, very small. I keep it clipped to my belt. The battery lasts a long time. Highly recommend for walking at night.
B003WKLOTQ|5.0|This is such a sweet movie! My little kids are captivated by it and ask to watch it regularly. I love it, too!
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|It would have been 5 star but when they killed Herschel, they killed an important part in the series..bad move boys, what do you have a problem with the older cast?  Truly disappointed, I was upset with Dale but Herschel.I grew to love that character!! Haven't decided if I will continue to watch that series. Who's next Rick, Daryl possibly poor little Carl? Come on!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I bought this because I had heard lots of great hype about it and at just $35, how could I not try it?  Installation was easy enough, although a little oversimplified to the point that minor details on how to actually use it were omitted.  I don't recall the device telling me that there would be an icon at the top-right of my Netflix app.  But that only took a minute to figure out.  Using it with my iPhone is a breeze and an awesome experience.  Not only being able to toggle captioning without pausing the movie, but I'm also able to close the app and use my phone normally without interrupting the stream.  So far, flawless in that respect.<br /><br />HOWEVER, when you're not using it, unplug it.  That sucker gets HOT.  I don't know if it's an issue with mine or what but keep an eye on that.<br /><br />I'm happy with it, overall.  But I feel like it could do more and from what I understand, there should soon be support for local media.  We'll see.  In the meantime, it's a low price tag and while it does very little, it is very good at the little it does.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|For My Little Pony enthusiasts this is a great game. It would definitely give it five stars if it didn't have so many glitches. It is constantly freezing, and friend sharing portion of the game never works right. If they fix those problems I would definitely up my rating.
B00FQMZ5M0|4.0|Awesome! Little confused about the blue ray when I thought I ordered a DVD but digital version works great! Awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The game is fun, the music is intoxicating but I am not liking the time outs!  Either the game is free or its not.  I'd like to know up front.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the most addictive game I have ever played. very fun and challenging. I lovensharing and competing with friends.
B002MW50KO|3.0|When you've recorded thirty-five full-length releases, you're bound to push out some half-baked ideas along with the great ones. &#34;Self-Portrait&#34; is truly bad, &#34;Knocked-Out Loaded&#34; is sleepy, &#34;Blood on the Tracks&#34; stands as a work of genius. But &#34;Christmas in the Heart&#34; is unique in the way it appears to have come from a session Mr. Dylan recorded during a gas leak. The highlights and low-lights are indistinguishable, with the worst tracks rendered in a way that makes it impossible to turn off. Is this the worst version of &#34;The Little Drummer Boy&#34; ever recorded? You bet it is. But you also can't stop listening. You have to know if it's going to retain that same Dylan croak through the whole lugubrious three minutes.<br /><br />By the time we're speeding through &#34;Must Be Santa&#34; with Bob Dylan doing his best Mel Blanc, screaming out the names of 20th-Century US Presidents along with a chorus of hundreds, one has either surrendered to the record or has sent it flying out the window, another victim of Christmas saturation. I suspect it will be the former for many Dylan fans and music aficionados at large. This is not a good record by any means, but it's an iconoclastic work that demands attention. You'll be putting it on for many Christmases to come, telling your friends that they have to hear Bob Dylan tackle &#34;I'll Be Home for Christmas.&#34;
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Outstanding movie.  Excellent story-line; action; suspense and keeps you watching every minute.  Super actors.  It doesn't get any better than Morgan Freeman!
B002HFJ77S|2.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's books, especially the Shopoholic Series.  I was in the mood for another funny, witty chik lit book so I searched for Kinsella books I had not read.  The premise of this book seemed odd, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I really wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't get into it and stopped about a quarter of the way through. The ghost premise was odd and the main character was annoyingly submissive.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the world tours and colorful scenery. I enjoy playing the missions score extra game treats jumping on top of trains soaring through the air on the fancy surf boards playing different characters. I think subway surfer is the best ever.
B00DP8XSQ2|4.0|It is more accurate than the last star map that was installed. This one knows what time of the day is.
B009NF54ZE|3.0|nice game, too much dialogue.  Less talking and more hidden objects needed.  Otherwise, challenging and thought provoking.  Maybe some new characters next version.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote everyday for articles for work, clipping recipes, jotting lists, organizing projects, voice notes, photos... All with reminders. Syncs across all my devices/computers.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I LOVE this album!  The tight harmonies almost make you believe there is a band playing behind the vocalists.  Looking forward to hearing more...
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was great to watch this again before going to the movie to see the new one.  This will become a classic.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|An episode does not go by without me laughing out loud. I enjoy the humor in every episode. I would recommend this season to anyone that enjoys comedy.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Fun and challenging.  The skill it takes to figure out some of the challenges makes this game worth every penny.  Put out the fires before it burns down the village by banking off something or moving something great idea. Kids of all ages will love this one
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Always love Bosch but the short stories(novellas?) suffer from not being as long nor complex as his full length novels
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Boring game. If you like hitting objects, you may like it. If someone is getting used to using the mouse on the computer, it might be a good learning tool.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a cute fun game.  But there are a lot of items-too many items-you have to have gems for, which you will probably have to spend money for.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I read the first book in the Theodore Boone series not knowing it was written for the teen reader. I have since read all of the books in this series. Boone is a great kid and I love his attitude toward life and helping others.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I liked this game alot! Graphics were wonderful and nothing was boring. The price after the free play was a little higher than I thought it should be but worth it in the end. I would recommend this to anyone who likes this kind of game!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I read this book because I had enjoyed the Potter series so much. I was very disappointed because of the rough language. I had to stop reading it. I read a John Grisham book and then came back to to finish Casual Vacancy only because I bought it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It's great for netflix for the most part.  Hard to beat the price if you want to stream Netflix from you iPad to TV. Wish it had more content sources, but this was clear in the reviews.  A little glitchy sometimes, but has never failed outright. Just sometime takes closing netflix app and restarting.
B008J34466|5.0|Pink is always awesome. Her sassy lyrics and catchy beats always cheer you up when you are having a bad day.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a book worth reading. Loved the references to the attorney's earlier success in Grisham's novel A Time to Kill which I thoroughly enjoyed--thanks for the memories. Of course I think Sycamore Row would make a terrific movie but they should get the same stars (especially for Jake) as in the movie version of A Time to KIll.<br /><br />Not all courtroom stories are as enjoyable as the ones John Grisham gives us.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think at first it was boring but as I got deeper into the game but when I found out that the coins were used to by power-ups It was off th hook
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great I'm on Minoan beach and all the locations rock, I have over 20000 bananas in under the first week it just rocks!!!!!!!!!!!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|still working on this one, have to change your way of thinking it isnt always easy, I would recommend it though it seems to be helping me thank you for the book thank you for the book thank you for the book.  gratitued chanes the way we think, and our lives
082300659X|5.0|You have to buy this book in conjunction with Classical Drawing Atelier. And do everything suggested and you will see what an exceptional teacher the author is.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|I love the hobbit dvd and being able to have all the extend extras is great. The statue that came with it is unreal, the detailing of it, and its nice and heavy
B004UID2LC|4.0|I love this app my only complaint is that often times it stop responding and I have to close it and reopen it. However when it works it works well. The sound and images are excellent.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Great app for kids!  It allows your child to form the letter, recognize the letter, associate the letter with an animal and other words.  It's great for kids with no letter experience because the graphics and sounds will keep them interested as they build their knowledge.  Then when their knowledge grows they learn how to build the letter and can associate object with that letter: apple, astronaut, airplane.  It helps kids start building their letter recognition and pre-reading skills.
B00F5AHEYA|5.0|Excellent sound, great packaging ... This is the best-sounding version of GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD I've ever heard. Simply astounding. Recommended.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Probably would have given 5 stars but I am old and my memory of reading the shining is overshadowed by more recent viewings of the movie so the transition was somewhat skewed.  Overall, I have seldom been disappointed in anything Mr. King ever published.  He did not disappoint this time.  I would recommend that one re-read &#34;The Shining&#34; and blot out your memory of the movie before reading &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34;.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I always enjoy John Grisham's books.  He takes a lot of time with each character to make them very believable.  The endings are always a surprise!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just really enjoy this series!  It keeps us focused on what is important.  I am anxious for the movie.
0307951154|4.0|Arguably, the hard-hitting Harry Hole series by author Jo Nesbo may be the best of the recent surge in Scandinavian crime fiction.<br /><br />PHANTOM is a bridge book with an open ending that finds Harry Hole possibly left for dead. The next novel in the series, POLICE, is listed as a Harry Hole novel so it remains to be seen what role Mr. Hole will play.<br /><br />In PHANTOM, Hole reunites with his formerly imprisoned son, Oleg and is working hard to keep him from returning to jail. It turns out the drug trade in Oslo that Oleg got wrapped up in recently saw a local junkie found shot to death. Not only was this individual one of Oleg's former cronies but Oleg himself is a suspect in the murder.<br /><br />As Harry attempts to find who the real murderer is he opens up a can of worms by following his clues into the deepest levels of government and law enforcement, not making many friends in the process. The phantom of the story is a reference made to people who are incarcerated and lose their identity. Oleg is clearly the phantom --- but is he also a murderer?<br /><br />You will be kept guessing right up to the cliff-hanger ending. Well done!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Absolutely perfect.<br /><br />The only downside is that most of the music that was used when these episodes premiered on MTV had to be changed due to copyright laws, but there's no need to be picky. Everything that was great about the show is still there.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|I love this movie, it is so cute and the kids enjoy it. I did think purchasing it would mean it would come to my door - looking into that.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|Not so interesting as I thought. Watched this movie after watching the show almost Human. You will never get to see his face.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This was my favorite movie of the year.  The extended edition is even better than the film I saw three times in the theater.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Good book and helped me start a good conversation .and also I like the way it explains it and describes how you should talk
B00004XPPK|5.0|This is one of the greatest films noir of all time.  The relationships are decadent.  There's some mystery, but really, it's all about the characterizations.
0804137501|5.0|Contrary to some of the negative reviews here, I personally believe that REMOTE is chalked full of practical advice for running a successful Remote company.  It covers set up, management, hiring and best practices for Remote companies.<br /><br />There is certainly a good chunk of the book dedicated to making the 'case' for remote work and if you're already bought into the idea, you probably could skim through this and not miss much.<br /><br />After reading this book on my flight back from Paris, I implemented the group chat advice and I experienced a significant increase productivity, cross function communication and real human interaction.<br /><br />Remote work isn't just about sitting in your home office and working in pajamas.  Remote (the book) advocates a philosophy that if you hire talented adults, give them ownership and provide them with the necessary environment for them to succeed, you can build something great.<br /><br />I hope this review helps<br /><br />@JimmyMackin
B009LDD4V4|4.0|This season should become a turning point in this series if they hear the voices in the wings.<br /><br />First they need a unifying Element that brings the various episodes together instead of having a series of independent and autonomous episodes. They have been trying in different ways. First of all they bring in a nasty criminal who is trying to frame and then destroy every single member of the team for various reasons. This chap, Christopher Pelant, is a hi-tech genius and he is using the surveillance networks the recent NSA scandal has revealed to take over the whole society via the famous cloud over our heads. If it is possible for NSA to do it, it has to be possible for anyone who has the technological know how and equipment. Ask Snowden if you do not believe it. But this link remains too loose so far and it only comes into the picture a very few times, particularly in the opening and closing episodes but that is not enough to coalesce the various episodes into some kind of saga.<br /><br />Then they develop, overdevelop actually, the personal levels, i.e. the personal and sentimental relations between the various members of the team and the interns. That is interesting but it has little to do at times with the story, with the episodes. It is even at times rather mushy on the whole and sentimentalese. There is a lot to do in this line but not as a flavoring, rather as a real dynamic element of the story line, of the plot.<br /><br />The third element is some kind of societal approach of these crimes and these criminals but the series avoids, systematically according to me, the political level and hence the political criticism that should be developed against this society that is trying to take over all our freedoms and that more or less consider everyone as a potential criminal which then leads to the development of fear, unease and even discontent that leads in its turn to defensive or protective if not criminal activities against this Big Brother. This discourse is always present in the back of the most distant wings but the series itself avoids it.<br /><br />In the same way the series that is dealing with hi-tech in the field of laboratory, health and other medical or biological sciences and practices. We could expect that here too the series developed a discourse that is never even approached though the series is dealing with it all the time: the danger this scientific and technological development contains in itself: the fact that it may lead the human species to a development that will have little to do with humanity. There is a lot to say about the imminent and extreme dangers this development can represent for our future as individuals, as free individuals and as a species. Machines that are going to be – so they say – more intelligent than men in 2050 will not need men any more and will get rid of these human animals and then they will establish a mechanical market economy without any buying public. The future is brilliant for a customer society without consumers. Brilliant Doctor Watson, brilliant! This series could really touch the problem from time to time.<br /><br />The last element is the criticism against the market economy itself that can be hijacked into becoming a tremendous source of power and money for some who can manipulate this market economy to their advantage by using technology and medical or biological sciences to create some economic opportunities, including for a cure to a disease they spread themselves. This is approached in one episode particularly, “The Pathos of the Pathogens” but that is rather limited in effect because it is an isolated case.<br /><br />The final criticism that is coming up in the series itself is the general attitude and tone of Bones herself, of Temperance who is a complete misnomer. She is not in anyway temporal, temperate or tempered with other people. She is excessive in all possible ways even abiusive. She bludgeons people with her knowledge, her science as if it were some aggressive object for some personal if not umbilical self-satisfied blunt force trauma imposed onto the contendents around her who should know better than question her judgment. She is vain and her science does not justify her humdrum and crushing tone all the time. In this season this came under fire in several episodes from various characters but will they be able to make her mature slightly so that she gets rid of this tone and starts feeling empathy for other people? So far they satisfied themselves with having her apologize in the worst cases of blunt scientific abuse to colleagues or bystanders.<br /><br />Of course the bodies are gross, the bones are all broken and manhandled and the criminals are predictable most of the time and then the whole interest is to find out how they are going to be trapped with science and once or twice with bluffing situational pressure if not duress.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUce as if it were some aggressive object for some personal if not umbilical self-satisfied blunt force trauma imposed onto the contendents around her who should know better than question her judgment.

0071766588|5.0|This is an excellent materiel and definitely required to practice real time level tests with CD's that comes with this book.
B004WR125O|3.0|Mixed feelings.  This works great to get you connected to the internet but is not ideal.  No specific problems in this piece but the stereo responds faster and better to having a wire into it's Ethernet port.  When using the Ethernet port I can turn my stereo on with the mobile app but with this lan adapter it only turns on the network when you first power on the stereo on the device itself and then when you turn it to &#34;net&#34; mode.  The Ethernet cable setup allow full network functioning at all times in any mode or power status.<br /><br />I was more satisfied when I replaced this with a range extender (I found on Amazon) that had an Ethernet port and set the second device next to my stereo to provide wireless access and better performance.  And for a similar price you also get a range extender by your stereo.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love this game, but I get frustrated when it's obvious that I can't beat a level or I can't move on to the next level because I don't want to spend money on tickets.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Once again Lee Child has done it again with the Jack Reacher series. Enjoy the character but alittle confused as to why he didn't stay within a timeline when reading the books in order. Child bounced around between Reacher's military career and his life after the military. That made it a bit confusing.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|I saw this movie many times when it was first released and have always loved it.  Remains a wonderful classic that anyone can watch.
B0029ZA3H4|5.0|The best online marketing books I have read. Gary gives it straight and he has an uncanny knack for seeing where the online market is going. Everyone I have recommended this book to has raved about it. A MUST read.
B005WTR4ZI|3.0|Too much like a Wired magazine article.  Hard to believe any research went into it.  Some good references in the footnotes.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Denzel is always great to watch. But except for the special effects budget, this feels like a TV Movie of the Week. I had high hopes for the movie, but it's very ordinary...and rarely misses an opportunity to give you a cliche character or scene. If you can stream it for free, Denzel might be enough to make you think you haven't wasted a couple hours of your life. But don't pay money for this.
B009R659L8|5.0|It was difficult to put the book down.  You want to keep reading, even when you know it is past your bed time.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Lame and Boring.  Only a special kind of genius can get this story wrong.  Wish I could get that 2 plus hours of my life back.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Bruce's 2007 reunion with his E Street Band after some years apart generates some energy, and I found the sound, in my car, perfectly fine.  However, I don't think that it's one of the indispensable albums.  Bruce is at his strongest when he can write songs that make connections with a larger world outside the private pains or joys of the singer, and the writing here, while accomplished, isn't on that level.  When you think of the verbal boldness that Bruce could demonstrate even before \\"Born to Run' that carried up through \\"Nebraska\\" and \\"Born in the USA,\\" it's not here.  This is good solid rockin' (\\"Radio Nowhere\\" and \\"Last to Die\\"), with some nice ballads for leavening (I like \\"Long Walk Home\\"), and Bruce sings with great assurance -- listen to his attack on the highish note in the refrain of \\"Girls in their Summer Clothes\\" -- and you realize again what is not sufficiently acknowledged: that Springsteen has a lovely voice.  And there's a nice unlisted thirteenth track that's a tribute to a lost friend that you should hear, and the title song shows some of the old verbal deftness, though it's relatively low-key.  On this album, sometimes the voice is placed back in the aural mix, sometimes more forward.  The sound is always pleasant, and the band is tight.  Good to hear, even if it isn't transcendental.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book really inspired my sixth grade readers. They liked it so much we decided as a class to read all the books in the series. It is quite thought-provoking, yet written without details some younger readers would not be ready to discuss.
B009TGODOK|5.0|What's not to like? Woody and his lovelies deliver his lines with aplomb and style, and the narration makes me feel like a little boy in 1963 listening to a National Geographic special. Go figure!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a game that appears deceptively simple but every level becomes increasingly difficult and will challenge your skills.  Beware!  Once you start you're hooked!
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Very nice game, lost of puzzles twist and turns but awesome. Can't wait to see if there will be a number 2
B004B8DH98|3.0|The characters were fleshed out well, very slow moving, just was not as complete a story as it should have been. George Clooney can make any role interesting. Too sophmoric
B00G4EXNNM|5.0|What is it that drives musicians to revisit older music in older styles?  One could have asked that question of the Everly Brothers themselves when they recorded this music in the 1950's, for it was far from \\"Cathy's Clown\\" and \\"Wake up, Little Susie\\" and such songs as made them famous.  But Dylan, Van Morrison, and more recently Bruce Springsteen have recently (in the past 25 years) gone back to \\"roots.\\"  What did Stravinsky think he was doing when he started \\"imitating\\" neo-classical forms?  The sense of belonging to and respecting a tradition obviously matters to some people, and it's hard to see that an effort like this one will be a huge money-spinner (despite the comment from a one-star reviewer who sees it merely as a dollar magnet).  But the music isn't that glamorous , and it certainly isn't glammed up -- the arrangements are chaste and pretty minimal.  This is a blend of folk, country, and gospel, and it's got a distinctive texture.  Jones and Armstrong have a good feel for the style, their harmonizing is nice -- it doesn't try to ape the original sound of the two male voices (it couldn't) -- and it's good to hear.  The \\"Barbara Allen\\" is a distinctive take on an old ballad, presumably a Kentucky version.  There are maudlin heart-breakers like \\"Put my Little shoes away\\" that tell us something about the ways in which people thought it appropriate to appeal to feeling in certain times and places, and there is the wonderful \\"Here to get my baby out of jail.\\"  These are dark songs -- the prospect of death and loss, for the singer or the subject of the song, is always present.  These are the great unavoidables of life, and this music acknowledges that.  The record is an homage to the Everlys, but more important it is, as the original Everly album was, an homage to the music and the ways of life it sprang from.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I liked this book.  It did not grab me or move me like some books but it was enjoyable to read.  I liked the way the story was told through someone else's eyes.
B00FVZJYK6|5.0|Laugh out loud fun for the entire family. We bought this when neighbors were visiting with kids; after the family left, my husband and I rented the first version and then watched this again.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief is a book of rare find. It is captivating, heartbreaking, uplifting;  food for the soul, food for the mind, a work that makes you look into yourself and ask, \\"What would I do? How would I react/respond? Am I compassionate and selfless? Am I an onlooker or a taker of action?\\" I love books that make me think and look inside myself; books that have the potential to create a better me...a better you!<br />This book has a narrator that I have never experienced before. It gives new depth and insight into the story and its characters.<br />I give this book 5 stars for the reasons above mentioned.
B005LAII80|5.0|It helped that I didn't expect much, but Dredd proved to be a fun romp that reminded me of the original Robocop with its quasi-plausible bleak future. This film is much truer to the comics Dredd than the earlier movie.<br /><br />I think a touch more humor would have helped; these kinds of movies are always a bit better when they're not taking themselves too seriously. The story isn't terribly original and it doesn't pick up much gravity, making few if any observations about law and crime, class structure, or corruption (and I think there were opportunities to do so without being preachy), but the earnest performances and a great soundtrack really pulled me in and everything just seemed to fit in the film's simplicity and over-the-top action.
B00E31L2JK|5.0|I think this book is amazing, all the things I should have learned in science but didn't. Its illustrated very well and explains concepts nicely.  I would recommend this to anybody who may have not gotten the best education in science..... or simply as a refresher. Really great book.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|(spoiler alert) Not one of the better Pendergast novels.  Corrie Swanson was never one of my favorite characters, so maybe I'm a little prejudiced. Although most people don't like to see favorite characters getting killed off, Preston & Child have done it before (very selectively) and it gives them a little more literary integrity than other authors.  The ending to this book was a let down and a bit of a cop out. I'd really like to see Pendergast acting more in his role as an official FBI agent in future books rather than just using his FBI status as a tool for cases of a personal interest.
B00CATONCA|5.0|This was a good choice! Everything is perfect: the box equipment met my espectations completely!<br />I choose to buy from the United States because of the &#34;original edition&#34; and the good price of course.

Bonus: Tom Cruise singing &#34;Paradise City&#34; and &#34;Pour Some Sugar on Me&#34; - who knew?
1601251556|5.0|Good Item. Didn't use it much. But my lack of usage doesn't mean it's a poor product. It bent abit too much for my liking though.
B0038NN3B4|3.0|It is an okay publishing.  Too many success stories and not enough recipes. This book offers a starting point to begin.
B00G8P27PM|4.0|Good movie, kids thought it was good to great. However they mentioned that the first one was better overall. We all would gladly watch it again though.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A most unique presentation, especially the narrative.  Excellent character development throughout the book.  I would highly recommend it, in particular to anyone interested in this period of history.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|I  think everyone should be aware of the many good things this book has to offer.  They will do no harm and may do a lot of good.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|One  of the best books in a long time. Not much gets me interested in books now but from the cover on wards I found this book captivating and awesome. I would love a movie of this book as well as a few more books. Brandon Sanderson keep writing more please!

B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Burned through the second half of the first season over the weekend. The way Tatiana Maslany can morph into completely different characters is pretty impressive.
B00GK5X2HC|5.0|This was a great movie to see after reading the book, both myself and my child enjoyed it. It was a huge improvement over the first movie. The Bull scene was by far the best of the show, great effects. Only part that I though could have been improved was the ending, but in either case it provides the basis for the next movie.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|I have owned [[ASIN:B008469DGY Flick Golf]] before from the same developer Full fat and loved it. This game is no exception. The graphics are superb so is game-play just like the original Flick Golf. This extreme version adds new challenges, 3D environment and much more. If you loved the original Flick Golf then you will find this game even better. This no way represents true golf game-play but merely for entertainment wherein you swipe and try your luck at a given target kinda game. If the ball drops into the target range you get points and that allows you to advance into other levels also unlocks additional levels.<br /><br />Full Four Stars for this pure entertainment! Extremely Flicktastic!

It really kicks ass!&#34;<br />Not the case, however.  I listened to the entire album, and it was a major letdown.<br />I doubt that I will ever play it again. It sounds like Boston doing Celine Dion songs, only I bet she would rock them harder!
B002PJN59M|5.0|Excalbur has a deep esoteric christian teachings that are rarely explained or taught openly. This movie does a good first pass attempt at the initial opening of these teachings.

B00000JSJC|4.0|Strange Days (Kathryn Bigelow, 1995)<br />[originally posted 7Mar2001]<br /><br />Bigelow, who bought centuries off her and her descendents' time in purgatory by crafting the almost-perfect film Near Dark, celebrated that film's tenth anniversary by teaming up with James &#34;my ego is Titanic&#34; Cameron for what, on the surface, looks like a Millennium Tension-gimmick one-off. It's too bad Bigelow, who's known for bucking trends, allowed herself to get sucked into working a gimmick film. Bigelow's directorial skills and Cameron's writing skills could have easily turned this into another Near Dark, but their need for a quick fix shot them in the foot. If you can look past the silliness of the New Year's Eve 1999 hysteria, however, there's a lot to like here.<br /><br />The story centers on Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes), a former vice cop who now deals in small 3&#34; CD-lookin' things capable of storing and playing back physical experiences. An anonymous contributor starts sending him discs of the contributor's murders with an especially sick twist; the murderer straps the victim into the same recorder, thus allowing the victim and the murderer to feel each other's emotions as the deed takes place. Now that's a mindbender.<br /><br />Between that and Nero's obsessive playing of his own tapes from a failed relationship, one assumes that the film is going to take the usual hysterical &#34;machines out of control&#34; approach, but Cameron pulls his fat out of the fire on a fairly regular basis by allowing that the technology does have its good uses, something rare in technothrillers. Add an exceptionally high-caliber supporting cast (Tom Sizemore, Juliette Lewis, Vincent D'Onofrio, the everpresent William Fichtner, a surprisingly fine turn from Angela Bassett as the female lead... you get the idea) and the whole thing comes together like biscuits and pork gravy. It doesn't have the harried, claustrophobic feeling that made Near Dark such a fabulous thrill ride, but it's certainly another Bigelow film that stands up to repeated viewings.<br /><br />Extra special mention should be made here of Glenn Plummer, who's starting to match William Fichtner in &#34;number of minor roles this guy pops up in in great films.&#34; Plummer is the guy all the action centers around, an angry young rapper found dead just before the beginning of the film, shot execution-style. He has a minimal amount of total screen time here, and his character is decidedly unlikable, but he's hypnotic every time he's on the screen. Keep his name in mind, if you don't already know it; if there's any justice in this world, someone will put all the pieces from this, Trespass, Menace II Society, Colors, and a handful of other excellent minor parts this guy's done together and get him into headlining roles ASAP. ****s certainly another Bigelow film that stands up to repeated viewings.<br /><br />Extra special mention should be made here of Glenn Plummer, who's starting to match William Fichtner in &#34;number of minor roles this guy pops up in in great films.&#34; Plummer is the guy all the action centers around, an angry young rapper found dead just before the beginning of the film, shot execution-style.

B001IYCMNA|5.0|I have two of these WAP's in my house.  One upstairs on one end of the house and the other downstairs on the other end of the house.

I've not had any issues with them at all.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I depend on the alarm clock on my smartphone to always work. Since discovering my newest smartphone, a Windows phone, the alarm clock was not dependable, I got the free version of this app for my Kindle as back up.

B00BATG18K|5.0|Great read and engaging.Love Amy Tans books and I was so looking forward to this book.It did not disappoint kept me spellbound.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I bought this on line at another site that did site to store so I could get it the same day and my wife could get some things she wanted without paying shipping.  Have had it for two days now and have some random thoughts:<br />1.  I started with the A/C adapter but went to just the USB so it would only power the chromecast when the TV was on...no overheated chromecast that way.  The USB cable is about 6 feet long.  There is also an extender cable included that you can put between the TV and chromecast that is supposed to improve wifi reception that is about 6 inches long.<br />2.  With hulu+ or netflix you have to have the video going before you can cast it<br />3.  With a google chrome tab you can cast anything that is in google but after I cast I can only use other tabs that were already open<br />4.  You have to be within 20 feet of TV to cast<br />5.  Casting hulu+ or netflix video from Kindle Fire or Motorola Xoom works fine as long as you have a good internet connection and you can then use the tablet for other things or turn it off<br />6.  If you have a problem with lip synch or jerky video when casting a chrome tab, try changing the video quality by clicking on the cast icon while the video is playing.  Have no idea what internet speed is needed to run high quality video, but my speed is 54 Mbps.<br />Overall am happy since we do not have cable, just set top antenna, and previously had to connect laptop to TV with an HDMI cable
B000PKX2KA|4.0|It is a good gps but it seems to be made for older operating systems and you probably have to download updated drivers to get it to work.  It wasn't just plug and play.  It was reading the tiny print to find the company website and start searching for support and downloads and installing drivers before it would work.
B00DHHWY9I|1.0|Very lousy film, not entertaining or of any real redeeming value. Pretentious, obnoxious, poorly written, wooden and uninspied acting.<br />I want a refund!
B00GLX1MG6|2.0|Ghastly-- this movie just didn't do it for me. There were a sprinkling of moments of brilliance that were delivered by Katheryn Hahn (the mother in the other mobile home) but other than that, it was a dud. I should have just turned it off and gone to bed.

B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This movie so perfectly emulates that 80s &#34;kid's go on an adventure&#34; movies that I loved as a kid.  Characters seemed real, and the story hit all of the beats that made those movies so memorable.  It loses a little steam near the end, but the ride is so fun and enjoyable, and you genuinely care for the characters.  Definitely worth repeated viewings, and the blu-ray itself looks incredible.  Although it's not as good as Speilberg's original efforts, the collaboration with JJ Abrams makes for a fun adventure.
B008UX2UIO|3.0|I really liked the characters and their development, as well as the writing style and overall story. However, the pace dragged during repetitive musings by Reilly.

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Never seen this film? You're in for a treat. Visually stunning. Award winning acting and script. This very long movie is set in the middle east during World War-1.<br />British army officer T.E. Lawrence is not like the other soldiers, he is very educated and cultured. His mannerisms are almost feminine. He prefers to use his brain and education to solve problems as opposed to gun fire or fist fighting. He also has a hard time following the orders and example set by his commanding officers yet accomplishes what nobody else had ever been able to.<br />I believe most of this film was shot in Morocco, Jordan, and Spain. It's a treat for the eyeballs to watch on Bluray on a large screen.<br />Like many films in theaters in the 1960's this one comes with a break in the middle, an intermission. Back then it was customary to go pee and get more popcorn. If the length of this film is too much for you for one sitting, break it up by watching to the intermission, then come back later and finish it.<br />Most of the action in this movie is in the first half of the movie, it sort of runs out of steam towards the end.  In this story, the Turks are the bad guys and the Arabs are the good guys who cannot fight back because they are too busy fighting amongst themselves due to religious and social customs.  Lawrence temporarily changes that and pushes the Turks back to their home country and briefly unites the Arabs.
006202406X|3.0|I was really excited for this book to come out. I loved the first two, and Insurgent left off with tons of potential... But this book failed me.<br />The dual perspective was confusing. Tris and Tobias have such different personalities, but it was difficult to tell who was narrating unless I flipped back to the start of the chapter to figure it out. Roth should have put more effort into creating individual voices for the two main characters.<br />After reading it I kind of just felt empty, it wrapped up okayish-- the characters all got a little bit of closure, but I didn't feel like I had any. I also really hated the ending, I felt that it was unnecessary to have that happen (not giving any spoilers).<br />In conclusion: the book wasn't terrible, but I probably won't read it again.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is an awesome collection.<br /><br />The first two special features on Raiders of the Lost Ark are &#34;new&#34; in the sense that they were never featured in DVD copies of the movies in the past and are like video blog documentaries on the making of the movie.<br /><br />To appreciate the films fully, make sure to turn off your flat screen tv's setting of noise reduction since it creates pixels on the natural grain which can be very distracting; otherwise, you might mistakenly think that your blu-ray discs are defective. The grain was purposely left in the digital restoration of the films. Also, do not make any other adjustments to your screen's viewing mode. Keep it at the standard mode because a dynamic setting mode which combines high brightness and contrast robs the film of its authentic look.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Although this set includes all of the Star Wars movies, it's disappointing in a number of ways that make me feel like we'll be getting a bigger, better edition sometime down the road.  There's a lot of good here, but also a lot that could have been improved.<br /><br />Good:<br />- All 6 films together in one package<br />- New and interesting special features and behind the scenes stuff that Star Wars fans love<br />- The prequel trilogy looks beautiful on blu-ray and is mastered very well<br /><br />Not So Good:<br />- Packaging - the envelope style case that you &#34;slip&#34; the disks into makes for easy scratching<br />- Image quality on the original trilogy - A New Hope looks like the color has been pumped up to overblown levels.<br />- No &#34;theatrical cuts&#34; (which I know is a nerd gripe, but we all want them SO bad)<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is worth picking up if you love Star Wars, but it still pales in comparison to the old Laser Disc &#34;Definitive Edition&#34; set, and it could have been done a lot better.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I would never thought this book would be so good when I saw the cover. This was a great book that taught me a lot about brutality and being brain washed and all kinds of stuff. I am a teenager and I liked this book so I think it is good for children and especially adults.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I'm not familiar with the Asimov novel, so I watched I, ROBOT with no preconceived notions.  And it's a well-made film with impressive visuals and super special effects.  Will Smith can play a paranoid, suspicious cop with the best of them, and he provides a solid performance as Detective Del Spooner--a man with an unfortunate past that puts him at odds with mankind's growing dependency on robotic labor.  So when a roboticist (is that even a word?) allegedly jumps to his death at the monolithic company that makes robots, Del immediately suspects foul play and corporate cover-up, yet the only other \\"person\\" with the scientist before his jump was a robot named Sonny.  And robots can't kill!  That's the first law of robotics!  So Spooner is a loner and against the system as he pursues the various leads availed to him, yet along the way he convinces a robotic programmer (Bridget Moynahan) that something is amiss. . .and that a robotic takeover is underway.  This leads to an over-the-top ending--along with the revelation who the real \\"villain\\" is--that's as nutty as it is predictable.<br /><br />This film has plenty of action, and again, the special effects are nothing short of stunning.  The animation of the robots looked a tad forced; in particular, during the action sequences, they looked more cartoonish than robotic.  And the plot is so multi-layered with robotic philosophical shtick it often gets in its own way.  But where I really cringed is when I saw that a very young Shia LaBeouf has a small role as a hotheaded street punk.  Can his fifteen minutes of fame please just go away?  Yet despite all my misgivings, if you're into science fiction and action thrillers I, ROBOT delivers both in a high octane way.  I'm just not looking forward to the day when your toaster can talk back to you.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|We had the original DVD set, but decided to upgrade to the blu-ray Ultimate Edition to get the extended cut (and make the jump to HD).  The purchase was well worth it, with the additional scenes making an already great movie even more fun for fans of the books - or just fans of the movie who want to see more.  The image quality is great, and the Ultimate Edition extras have a little something for everyone.  Although I'm not usually a big fan of all the little things that come with a collector's set, the book and behind the scenes material here is fun, and worth diving in to if you have the time.  As for the rest of the Ultimate Edition collection, I'd say that Chamber of Secrets is also worth the Ultimate Treatment (since it also includes an extended cut), but 3-7 are worth skipping in their ultimate formats unless you absolutely need every special feature.
1449430295|5.0|I love Dilbert and, working in corporate offices for the past 20 yrs, completely understand where he is coming from.  I have purchased this calendar for myself for the past 5 years and am never disappointed.<br />The calendar is nice size for a desk and offers many more comics than the wall calendar, one per day with the exception of weekends.  I guess they figure that most people using this are working Mon-Fri shifts so they put Sat/Sun on one page.  This is a change that they made 2 yrs ago but doesn't take away from the calendar though.<br />Although these comics are recycled from comics that were printed in the daily papers, they still seem to be timely.  On a weekly basis, I find a comic that is related to something going on in my office at that time.  Goes to show you how Dilbert holds his value!<br />I thoroughly recommend this calendar to anyone who loves Dilbert or for those who work in Cubeville at work and want a good laugh on a daily basis.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook works like a charm. Some apps don't required much &#34;how to&#34; it is friendly enough for the convenience of any user around. Overall, great app.
B00DVZ414C|1.0|Any soundtrack regarding folk music...using \\"modern folk artists\\" that doesn't include The Avett Brothers is really laughable....I mean Marcus Mumford?  Wtf...??Anyone that thinks Dave Mathews + banjo (also known as Mumford and Sons) is folk music, doesn't have a clue.  I'm really disapointed that the Cohen brothers wouldn't recognize this... The Avett Brothers are Americas truly great folk band.  If you are not familiar with their music...then do a little research and you'll understand.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun game, really addictive! I only wish that lives would renew faster! You won't be disappointed with this game. Graphics are great also.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|LOVE Tracks 1 and 2, it's rare that I make it past those tracks, but overall, it's an excellent album!
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Our family loves Wall-E, and the blu-ray edition of this movie is the perfect way to watch it at home.  Although the story is quiet and slow enough to lose the attention of our youngest (4 years old), the rest of us can enjoy the beautiful animation and touching story. As usual with a Pixar film, the animation is top notch, with rich details and characters that are expressive without needing loads of dialogue.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I really loved this book. It was beautifully written. Others have spoken in their reviews of the worthlessness of the protagonist, but I don't agree with that. I cared about him for the very reason that he, like all the rest of us, was terribly flawed. I think he said it well himself: that we cannot help who we are. In the end, he was changed and he did finally do the right thing. Sometimes it takes us a lifetime to do that, and sometimes we never make things right. I felt it was a great book. It took a lot of skill to write about the convoluted story line. I do agree that some of the details and long sentences, although very lyrical and beautiful, did bog own a bit and maybe some of the longer passages could have been pared down. I say that with a bit of sorrow, because I love long books and I would be hard-pressed to say which parts should be cut down. And, quite honestly, I'm unsure of what that sort of altered book would look like, and the cuts might even ruin the novel, I really don't know. So, with that ambivalence in mind, I'll still say that I loved the book. A great read.
B00701L5XS|3.0|I wasted my time downloading this game. Maybe I don't know much about it or it didn't meet my expectations. I'm giving it 3 because it might be just me.
B00C5WR6JE|5.0|I've been listening to this CD and I love it. I was surprised to read the negative reviews with statements like \\"This album is simply not my idea of what pure/real jazz is.\\" IT'S NOT JAZZ!!! Who said it was? Great composition and lovely execution. Frisell is a great American composer.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|There is a HEAVY emphasis on purchasing &quot;crown&quot; (with real cash) and ties to Facebook in order to advance in the game. If you (like many) hate bothering your Facebook friends with constant game requests and refuse to feed money into a quest based slot machine this is not the app for you. If the developer redesigns this part, I'd give it 5 stars.  You CAN play WITHOUT doing the above mentioned-but it's a constant struggle.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|His books never fail to keep you on the edge. You won't regret the purchase . His books are always good.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This movie was so surprising and engaging in ways that I wouldn't have imagined.  I went into it with no expectations, as I was invited to see it by a friend, but hadn't heard anything about it.  The story combines awesome science fiction action with great cultural commentary, and does exactly what all good science fiction should do - it makes you think.  It's definitely a more character driven story than your typical sci-fi actioner, but worth watching if you even remotely enjoy the genre.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have been very pleased with this product.  The large keys make it easy to see. Works great for balancing my check book.
B008602KQI|5.0|&#34;The Hunger Games&#34; is an excellent movie!!  The main plot/ storyline of the movie is one that is a bit heavy, and (I believe) could produce some deep, psychological questions from any viewers who are underage - and not familiar with the original, Roman &#34;hunger&#34; games.  As long as you're aware before you view it, that this is an ADULT THEMED movie - I felt that for what it was (for the story that it is to tell), the movie is extraordinarily well-acted and compelling!!  It is a long movie, but progresses quickly enough that you're not really aware of the time passing - throughout. Jennifer Lawrence - as well as the two lead actors - have been EXCELLENTLY cast, and cause viewers to feel like you're right there with them as the adventure unfolds!  I loved this movie, and would highly recommend it to any Action/ Adventure fans!!
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|The game seem to be really fun, my niece really enjoy playing it but not before long it starred skipping and freezing often unroll the point it won't even open at all anymore and its been like this for about two weeks now. She is really upset about it. I tried updating and it just won't open.  Please do something about it I have to babysit her every day and she goes crazy when she can't play her game. (She's four so she does not understand why it won't work she thinks I'm being mean and I don't want to share my kindle)
1451666179|5.0|Love her blog and knew I had to have the book. Super colorful pages were a plus. Made my side's hurt laughing!
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|I'm really glad to hear new music from Boston! The production is well-done, with crystal clear tracks and solid mastering. If you're hoping for the '70s/'80s pop sing-along songs of Boston and Don't Look Back, that's not what this album is about. Nobody could really sing along with high tenor vocals, three octaves above the natural human range anyway, so when I bought this album I wasn't looking for another batch of terrible karaoke songs to begin with. I loved those sing-along songs, but I also know that songwriters go through phases, and like God and snowflakes, no good composer constructs two identical songs. If they did, the band would be called AC/DC. Anyway, while this release isn't an adrenaline rush of snappy pop rock, it's a pleasant listen, and I'm glad to have had to opportunity to help keep the bills paid for these legends of rock. I love all kinds of music, and spend hundreds of dollars per month browsing the new release racks for the latest from brand new bands and classic rockers alike. What I'm tired of is the attitude, in the music industry, that if a musician passes the 30-years-old mark, he should hang up his guitar and get a new janitorial career. If you wanted to hire a really good electrician, would you hire the brand new guy with six months experience or the experienced electrician with 30 years experience? Musicians improve with age, just like electricians and good wine. So I appreciate what Frontier Records has been doing: releasing brand new music from great bands who have the skills and experience to show those new guys how to sing and play guitar!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|I mindlessly assumed this book was just a rewrite of a TV script so I avoided it. After finishing my last read I was looking for another good book and Maxwell & King popped up again? I thought, oh well how bad can it be? Now I have to need to ask Mr Baldacci to please forgive me for thinking I wouldn't like something he had written. This book was a page turner and it actually made me wonder if the TV series would be back. If it does come back, I will watch this time. Plus I hope there will be a Maxwell & King Part II or Maxwell & King Ride Again.......whatever.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an incredible writer.  She grabs you on page one and you just can NOT put it down.  Cannot wait to read her next novel.  She is so intense, I had to take a little break.  I expect great things from her in the future.
B00CEB5QU2|4.0|This thing is flawless. My main purpose for this was to stream video. All my videos are full 1080 HD and there was no lag what so ever. I'm not sure about battery life cause it just got delivered today. My only flaw is it doesn't play avi format videos but I believe I read somewhere there is a work around for this. It has a nice finish to it and it's very light. I bought a 64 gb sd card to to use in the slot but I may not even need it since I was able to plug in my mini mobile external 320 gb hard drive.!!!! Now my ipad air just went from 16gb to 336gb!!!! LoL!!!!!<br /><br />Pros<br />Lightweight<br />Stream HD is great<br />Great finish<br /><br />Con<br />Won't play avi
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Neil is such a special talent. his stories are always full of adventures and full of the most beautiful imagery. I couldn't stop reading from the moment I turned the first page. at moments I forgot I had errands to run and responsibilities to attend to - this story made me wish in was a kid again and all I had to do was read!

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Not many sequels are as good as the first movie but this sequel is better than the first movie and then some.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham at his  best. You will recognize some names and places from &#34;A time to Kill&#34;. I love the ending.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had a little trouble with this book due to the constant changes from one character's perspective to another and from one time period to another.  Just about the time I'd get emotionally engaged with a character, I was moved along to another. By the end I felt somewhat unsatisfied because I never got to reconnect with some of the characters I had come to care about.  I gave 5 stars to Khaled Hosseini's previous two books, but this one didn't do for me what the other two did.  It was a little disappointing.  That said, I think this book is still well worth the read.  I love Hosseini's narrative style and in many ways the ending made up for the frustrations of the constant character changes.
B009RH9HDS|2.0|I bought thus thinking it was Orange, turns out it's peach, almost pink, like the case, just not the color, forced to return it, reordered it in charcoal

B009NXD6JM|5.0|Awesome old favorite watched it with my 18 year old would highly recommend.Whats not love romance and of course Moonriver.
B004UID2LC|2.0|My husband has my old Fire, the original. I am not a You Tube person so I did not know there was an issue getting the site to work. I tried a few of these aps and found one that worked but this was not it. Did nothing. I gave it two stars since it may be great for you, just didnt do it for me.
B002V092B0|4.0|It is an excellent book. Very informative although a little technical and repetitive at times. Was an amazing to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad it finally came for the kindle...can't put it down..love this game. Try it and you will be hooked too. its simple..
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Great read! This is a book that goes into some deep scientific detail, but it is formatted so you can get the bottom line without dying in the details.
0345529057|5.0|i am readind the last of the books now a dance with dragons wich is not included in the deal but the first four was great the come in a very pretty collectors box ans the are so so interesting way better than the movies theres much more detail in the books i think georgr r.r. martin is a genuis he reay take you into the whole world of game of thrones starting with winterfell and ending up in pyke the iron islands kings landing and casterly rock its the whole seven kingdoms and lets not forget the queen of dragons mother of dragons danerays targarean. its is all so very cool starks lannissters the iron born greyjoys and lannisters its all aout just who will end up sitting on the iron throne.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Rewatching all the seasons and while this was slower than 1 and 2 I still love this series. Thanks Amazon for carrying all the seasons I almost missed out a great one. This truly a gruesome series I have to admit but I am so enjoying rewatching it for the second time. I would highly recommend getting this series you won't be disappointed!
B008GWOVB8|5.0|Very good copy! I know with the DVD there have been many different releases of this film and a lot of complaints about sound quality. When I bought the DVD (before I had a Kindle Fire) it took me a week to wade through the reviews to find a decent copy. Well wade no more, buy this one for your Kindle and wow - great sound and great video, no problems. Mind you, I have a Fire HD so I cannot speak for a regular Kindle but I see no reason why it wold not be the same quality. As for the film itself, its a classic and if you grew up with it you will love it. If you like musicals you will love it, if you fit neither category, run for the hills you will hate it. (unless you liked Hairspray).
0553801473|5.0|This is an awesome series of books.  Martin is a masterful writer that combines characters, plot and action in an exciting and memorable way.  Personally, he is a very friendly and engaging person and I am happy to support him and his work.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|enjoyable. realistic. scenery options in scenario are good and is easy to use. animals look close to life like rate 4 1/2 stars
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great book.  It takes after the first one.  You get so engrossed In the story that you feel like you are a part of the group.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book out of the series. Everybody should read it. It had a lot of things that I didn't expect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the, The Hunger Games<br />This is a fast paced action packed novel with suspense to last a lifetime. Nothing is expected in this book which really just makes it better. The characters in the book are easily remembered. The plot is great and I like what Collins based the story off of (look on Wikipedia for that
B0094BB4TW|1.0|What the heck? I see no use for this, its confusing and does not give you the full experience. Just go to Facebook.com and deal with it, you do not need an ap.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Awesome movie.  The extra footage flows seemlessly and adds just a bit to the film that I think makes it better.  The differences are not as noticable as the extra footage in The Lord of the Rings trilogy was, but you can pick it out if you're familiar with the movie.  The special features are wonderful, and the commentaries are fun and really interesting.  If you are a fan of The Hobbit then this is the movie for you.
B001QL5MAA|5.0|Truly a great read. Tremendous ideas, good character development, great story telling, keeps you hooked and coming back for more!
B00005JMYI|1.0|There's not much to say about this movie.  Except this is the worst comedy I've ever seen.  I really enjoyed Will on Satruday Night Live so I was expecting a lot when I went to see this movie.  Not sure why because most Saturday Night Live Spin-off movies are not funny.  But, this was the worst one of all. The movie was horribly written and acted.  &#34;Stewart Saves His Family&#34;, &#34;Superstar&#34; and &#34;The Coneheads&#34; were all atocious films but not nearly as bad as &#34;Achorman&#34;.  It's beyond me why they decided to film a sequal so many years after the original.  If you are five years old or like dry, dull humor that doesn't make any sense, then you will probably love this movie.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie is a classic! One of the funniest holiday movies around. I highly recommend it! It's a must see during the holiday season!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The flow of the three books has been an easy read and very enjoyable. Mockingjay is a well written and very enjoyable read.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|It was an outstanding bway play and movie. Music was excellent, acting was great. Loved it! Passionate! Touching!, dramatic and superb. Compared to other musicals the story seemed so real that I was oblivious to anything else except what was happening in the movie.
B008AT71WI|5.0|It was everything I've wanted in a LIttle Shop of Horrors home video product for 20 years... well, probably closer to 15, but still.  I've watched it three times since I've gotten it, and will watch it many more times before I'm done.
B000B589JI|1.0|Arrived in the sealed package but was missing &#34;inner cap&#34; and &#34;nozzle cap&#34; therefore useless.<br />Made in China not USA as described.  Returned for refund from Amazon.
B00CNQ7CRI|1.0|it was very boring and hard to get into reading it. I never did finish it. waste of money in my opiniion
B001FB4VY4|5.0|Amazing as always. DVDs work fabulously & cast is one of a kind. My favorite show by far out there.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Once I got the hang of this game I loved it. It's not hard but can be addictive great game. Try it for yourself :)
B0013F1D02|5.0|this was a fun, heart warming movie.  The kind of movie you want to watch when you want to put your stresses on the back burner for a couple of hours. I really enjoyed Peter Di Nero as the crazy but wise pirate captain.  I will watch this again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great page-turner. Love the format and getting to know the characters so well. Very vivid characters and places. I've read some reviews and heard from friends who did not like the ending, but I thought it fit. The author stays true to the characters until the very end and I respect that. The mystery, the suspense... it's all very intriguing and a little disturbing. Reminds me of &#34;The Redeeming Power of Brain Surgery&#34; by Paul Flower, which I read this summer (check it out if you like &#34;Gone Girl&#34;). All in all I highly recommend this book!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Lovely game with many levels. Fun for hours! I bought this to play on the plane on my Kindle Fire. It helped pass the time quickly.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book will stay with for your life. One of the best books I have ever read and I have read thousands,
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|Love them as always!!! My favorite show! I've watched every season many times! Quality of DVD is wonderful. Love the bonus features.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Needs easier way to build deck - campaign is fun I believe there should be more cards given while u play campaign
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like the game, it is fun, has a good theme, but sometimes freezes up, I have to restart my kindle fire. also, is sometimes choppy during gameplay.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|just a sex soap opera, in a book, not a literary masterpiece.. Read if you want just sex, sex, sex!

B00BUCW54Q|3.0|I am reading the Jack Readher series and don' t think Tom Cruise fits the role in the movie.  His voice and stature are not as I see and hear while I am reading.  I have always lked Tom, just not for this part.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|I love these games.  I love solving the puzzles and the stories. I love that I can try them for free and they are not that expensive as long as they work after you buy them.
B0034G4P80|5.0|This movie can only be topped by the Avengers movies and...well...the Ironman movies, but I am a big Ironman fan so forgive my prejudice. It is a must buy and or a very must rent movie. Do it now. &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;
0307405095|5.0|I had borrowed this book from my local library. I wanted to own it. There are many wonderful and easy recipes for people who love to bake.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|This is a book I'm glad to have finished.  Frankly, it wore me out with its array of characters which, in my opinion , added nothing to the story.  I've read books by this author in the past and enjoyed them, but this one is definitely not one of his best works.  Perhaps if I could read German, it might have helped!
B0000266T2|5.0|This Cd of Simon & Garfunkel was done in Central Park and that being said provided the live audience reaction from the crowd on each and every song.<br /><br />Brings back memories of a great team of song writers.

B00992CF6W|3.0|Minecraft pocket edition needs more.It needs like what the computer and an Xbox has Creative and Survival.That's why my review is a bit low.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|It was a good movie and I would recommend others watching it. I wouldn't rate it as one of the best movies. I'm not a big Kristen Stewart fan. Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron's characters were the far more interesting character portrayals. That is not to say that Kristen didn't do a fine acting job. I just felt that she was miss cast as Snow White.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great production from the Brits again. David Tennant, formally a very good Shakespearian actor and for a time Dr. Who, is now a Scottish detective investigating a kids murder in England.<br />An interesting look at a typical close-knit community and the secrets people keep from their neighbours.<br />Olivia Coleman is great in this (as Tennant's side-kick), she is bitter after he is given her promotion. Despite their relationship starting quite acrimoniously they develop a a shared keen desire to 'get the killer'.<br />8 episodes

B00GSAC1UI|5.0|This album is amazing!  Very talented people! I hope everyone gets this and enjoys it as much as I do!
B00G70JQZC|4.0|I felt the movie was entertaining and well acted. It had plenty of action and I highly recommend watching the movie. The only draw back was the ending. I felt it could have been better. It was sort of an anticlimactic. You can decide for yourself. You won't be disappointed as the rest of the movie makes up for it.
B00GLX1MG6|1.0|Absolutely disappointed. All the jokes are in the trailer, so don't bother buying.<br />Jennifer Aniston cusses a bit and takes some of her clothes off...you now who this will appeal to. I just wish she'd do something good for a change. Dancing in your underwear? Cussing? Oh come on! Your real, we get it. Now do women a favour and put your clothes back on. (Besides, she is no Sophia Vergara.)
B000000993|4.0|This is the best Tool release. If you don't have any this is the one to buy. Play it loud.
B000T433CO|5.0|This movie is just perfect. Funny, romantic and original (the home exchange was an interesting idea for me at least)! Completed by a great cast and setting!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I love this book because it is a strong reminder of what corporate can and cannot do to the individual soul.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this novel in a day! I couldn't put it down! I don't even know what words to use to describe how much I loved this story. The way Colleen writes makes the characters so insanely tangible and relatable. She had me laughing and crying at the same time. I feel like I just made a whole new group and friends, and I don't want to let them go! Thank God there are two more books in this series!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I loved this movie. Best movie ever. I have watched it again and again. Cannot get enough. Looking forward to the next movie. With that being said, the expectations for the second movie may be so high that it will end up disappointing as the this movie was just that good and would be very difficult to top or to match.
B0015F1VY8|3.0|A little bit sensationalised and the love story a bit far-fetched but love watching Kate Blanchett, she is a great actress
B00005B36H|3.0|Wanted to see what else they had written, this was not my favorite album however they still come through with heavy dark and loud rock
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|Snappy processor! I am highly impressed by it! Does everything with ease! Only slight issue that I have is that if you don't have a graphics card and use the APU as your graphics-- it tends to run hot. It can play just about anything, but you need good cooling and prefferably a graphics card. I recommend this product and it is very good for budget builds. It does run on a bit more electricity than other APU's.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I purchased this book because of its popularity and all the good reviews it received. I found it to be just an okay read. The story seemed to drag on at times; however, I loved the style of writing. Unpredictable ending.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is fun and it helps me relax when I am having a really bad day it is also kid friendly
B00GX59QO2|4.0|Not as good as the first, but my expectations may have been too high as the first movie rocked! Still I highly recommended that you watch it. The twist at the end definitely surprises.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This was a fun book to read, and the experiments were even more fun. Believe it or not, they really work. Pam Grout has a numerous way of presenting the truth. I recommend E-Squared without reservation.
B00GH4R95C|4.0|Great movie! Watched it with the kids (11 and 8) and we all liked the movie a lot. I recommended watching it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. Perhaps someone should create a 1 page summary of the book for those who don't want to take the time to read.
0439023521|3.0|After reading the Hunger Games vol. 1 I was confused on really what to think. I found the book to be very well written and keep the attention of the reader throughout the whole book.  Yet, I found the book to be very violent, explicit, graphic, and unsettling for the targeted audience. The entire book was about the poor children killing each other only for the entertainment of the rich. There was one scene in particular that changed my opinion of the book.  At the end of the actually ‘Games’ when it is the final two and they are about to eat the poisonous berries but they are stopped by the Games announcer and both are crowned victors.  It made me think of all of the other kids in the games and how they were maliciously murdered. And what was the point? There was none. The end of the book brought no redemption, no real victory. It was simply mass murder. My problem with the book is that this type of story targets 12-14yr olds (which includes two of my younger siblings) I cant imagine them reading it and not having it affect them some how. I believe the message this book puts forth is that good guys don't exist, and humans are essentially evil beings who will repeat atrocities of the past. To me, that is not valuable. And in my opinion, parents should not let their children read this series.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|This app is free only in the sense that it costs nothing to download! You have to pay real money before you c an actually play the game. I would not have downloaded it had I known that.
B000VIK8D0|3.0|It was an entertaining movie and quite enjoyable. I would recommend you watching it. I liked Kurt Russell's &#34;Tombstone&#34; better as the bad guys were more interesting characters. However there are things in Wyatt Earp I liked better. Kevin Costner was the better fit as Wyatt Earp. Dennis Quaid definitely had the look for Doc Holliday. Isabella Rossellini Made the better &#34;Big Nose Kate&#34;. Watch both and decide for yourself. :)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's star trek, what fan wouldnt love this?  I hope they keep making these movies! Kirk is awesome, and just...Khan....
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was a great read. I hesitated to read a book form the &#34;dog's perspective&#34; but it did not feel clumsy at all. I will definitely read another book by Garth Stein I the near future.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting book.  Could not wait to read books 2 and 3.  Even though it is fiction, it could be true in a few years if the government continues to rule everything.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Very 'bad' and entertaining.  Great writing, clever and story lines. Superb acting. I love the dry humor, Really enjoy this series.
B00082ZS5W|5.0|This is a great set.  If you like some of her hits then this collection is the set for you.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A great read.  A Time to Kill was a great book and reading Sycamore Row was like catching up with old friends since it take place three years later. I read it in two nights, couldn't put it down.
1444777556|5.0|This book is the second of the most moving book I have ever read.  Thhis is also a must read.  this life experience that must be shared.  recommend this seller for his service, price and delivery.

B00150VWX8|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for Maazel to record this. It is a wonder to hear and a great way to get a Ring fix when you can't get to Bayreuth or even your Szolti recordings.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I watched the Netflix series in one week-end.  I had to have the book.  The book was an enjoyable read, but the series was better and I look forward to the next installment.

B00GMONG90|5.0|PTX is the most incredible group. All five people are needed for each song, and it sounds like a whole lot more than just 5 people! Research all of their songs on youtube and subscribe to their channel. Be sure to check out the Wizard of Ahhs video. It's priceless. I only discovered this group a month ago and I'm already a pentaholic! They're just that good! Check them out, then support them by buying PTX, vol. 1, PTXmas, and PTX, Vol. 2.
B008J05EL8|2.0|I can't get this app to open. I'm sure I would like it if it worked. Anyone have a suggestion?
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Really holds your interest. Has a number of levels.  Its not only a game but a good teacher. Good practice.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved the combination of love, mystery and excellent writing.  Ms. Moriarty has a way of writing all the way through her epilogue that keeps the reader intrigued.
B002NPUCIA|5.0|Brian Culbertson -one of the best Jazz talents to emerge in the past decade!  This is a live recording -featuring the best studio and recording musicians in the current Jazz scene today - great tunes - all of them fantastic!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Great show. The acting and production are fantastic. We go back to our other shows and they just seem cheesy after watching this.

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|The story behind the brave young lady who is fighting for girls education in a country that would prefer that women be not seen and not heard from.
B004SBX112|4.0|It is interesting and keeps you interested. Each level is something different and holds your attention. The more levels you conquer the more you want.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best television series ever!  It's a wonderful look into how that class of society lived in the early/mid 1900's.  Can't wait for the new season!
B0025X4P24|5.0|Vanessa Williams makes a come back with a Jazz standard type release that is even better than the other artist's release of the same type.  Songs that are new and backed by a big band - all are upbeat and rockin- Loved it!!!  Go get this one!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game it's challenging and fun. I especially love the new wheel I love getting the prizes. It's a lot of fun hope they come out with more levels.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is very addictive and enjoyable. Both of my children use up their allotment of web time playing this game.
B005COO1X6|5.0|As always, King provides the best.  Even the 'not so deep' ones keep me reading to the last, if not in one sitting, then no more than two!
B003B02O0A|5.0|I had read this when it first came out and loved it. After reading the sequel, Sycamore&#34; I went back, read it again to get the sequence again. Loved it all over again and it really tied into and added to Sycamore.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I loved it and can watch it a 100 times. I am not a purest,  I just enjoy watching it with out criticism. So what if R2 is behind a lot of rocks. If you look for errors and blupps you will find them in any movie.One thing I paid £44.00 including shipping that's apx $70.00 Amreican from Amazon Uk.  You must have a region free player if you purchase dvd's from Europe.  Dennis
B005529EI2|5.0|Excellent visual rendition of one of the greatest books of one of the greatest series of these  books ever written.
B005MW2Z8Q|5.0|very pinkfloydish nice laid back but just enough edginess great story line guitar work is excellent if you like that 70s Pink Floyd sound<br />then this would be a great album to add to your collection
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I learned 8 languages through DUOLINGO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is so Awesome!!!!! Probably one of the best apps I've ever owned.<br /><br />P.S. Works best for the IPad.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|I have worked in medical labs and the morgue myself and like how she keeps it real, true to life
B006P4FBUE|5.0|Will definitely be using this app for Christmas carols this Christmas !!!<br /><br />Easy to pick out tunes with one finger -- even one hand....and if your hands are small and dexterous enough, you can even play with both hands..<br /><br />I'm sure this app will come in handy often - especially when there is no keyboard or piano available.
B00CBRH4YU|1.0|It was very confusing, disconcerting, to try and figure what was being said to who and in what language. the subtitles were on-screen, but it was difficult to decide: Were they thinking? speaking? huh?  It was sort of like watching a silent movie with the wrong subtitles.There was very little direct dialog.<br />Ben Affleck had very few lines, maybe some of his thoughts were voiced?<br />It would likely have been a good story without all the mysterious, French and Spanish dialog that didn't match the action...<br />Don't spend the money.
0684833395|5.0|Classic story. I love this book. My wife and i both read it (out loud to each other). Fun book.
B00EP22QKG|5.0|Joan Jett & the Blackhearts are back! If you were ever a fan previously of Joan Jett, or Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, do not miss out on this album. Unvarnished sounds great. Joan Jett's vocals are stronger and better than ever, and her style is still rock & roll. I repeat, you cannot miss out on this album! A great great buy!
B0045HCJ8U|5.0|What's not to love about this Tennessee Williams story?  Brando is wonderful and gorgeous as Stanley and Vivien Leigh is superb and lovey as Blanche.  I had not seen this movie for many years and forgot the range of emotions it brings to the viewer especially the feeling towards Blanche...from realizing she is a &#34;phomy&#34; to then coming to know she is mentally ill and very tragic.  If you love Williams, you will love this movie.
B00D02Z1EA|5.0|It's a good album from a good band going on their 6th album? Yup this guy's are genuine and unique with enough energy to power up..um.. 3 light bulbs! Seriously though this is why I still listen to metal
B008Z9YGEE|2.0|Dull, slow and boring, bad acting and story. I don't understand the popularity of this movie.  Harrelson is awful and Lawrence is plain. Wwatch something else.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|very good movie, good acting. enjoyed the supporting cast, especially John Goodman! Denzel did an amazing job worthy of recognition...
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This is a fun and sometimes challenging version of the calssic board game. The AI players will tease and challenge you during game play. My kids picked it up quickly and they have even beat me a couple of times. The game play otion of up to 5 players with either AI or human players is great. Now we want to find the original so that we can play on somethign bigger thatn a phone or Kindle Fire.
B00DJUPLY8|2.0|Don't works to me. I wasn't able to see the videos than I want at all. Even do is a friendly program
B000002LSV|5.0|A must have for anybody calling themselves a ZZ Top fan. Great music, great hits, great choice. You can't go wrong with this one.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Love this game! Your only limit is the speed of your finger! Tutorial is easy and the instructions are easy. You can teach anyone to play in less than a minute. I recommend it.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Fasting works.  Plain and simple.  This book is an easy read.  Most of the information you can get on the Fast Diet website.  However, I still encourage you to read the book.  It serves as a good resource.<br /><br />I was unaware that this book was out there, and that it was sweeping the UK and US.  I noticed on nights I played tennis and skipped dinner that I was losing weight, regardless of what else I was eating during the day.  I'm a very active person.  I work out at least 5 days a week (intense cardio, barre, and boot camp), and often play tennis in addition to that 3-4 times a week.  However, I've struggled losing 15 pounds since my last baby.  I googled fasting as a diet and this book and its website came up.  That was in September 2013 and now 12 weeks later I've lost 7 pounds.  HOWEVER.......7 pounds might not sound like much in 12 weeks, BUT I've lost more inches than pounds.  It's unbelievable, really.  My body is looking like it did in my 20s...and before my 3 kids!<br /><br />I fast 2 days a week, and sometimes I fast dinner on the days I eat normally.  However, that's usually because I've eaten a big lunch and afternoon snack.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  There are days that are difficult, and weeks where there isn't a difference on the scales, but measure yourself before starting and then measure every week.  That's where you'll see the difference.  You'll notice your clothes feeling looser in no time.  Even my &#34;pooch&#34; that came with baby #3 is disappearing.  I already have a small waist...but just couldn't get rid of that &#34;pooch&#34; below my belly button.  But it is disappearing!  And I feel great.  Even on my fast days, my energy level is very high.  I try not to fast on my super intense cardio days, but I do on other days I work out.<br /><br />I also recently had a check-up with a new doctor, who did a full blood workup, etc.  When we were reviewing the results he was amazed at my numbers on everything.  As I said, I'mvery active and also a vegetarian, but I know the numbers were so good because of fasting.  The doctor couldn't believe how healthy I am.  Despite the fact that I still need to lose 8 pounds.  He said he didn't even think that was a big deal, couldn't tell I needed to lose weight, and had to flip around in my chart to see my current weight.  I danced myself out of his office that day!
0670023329|5.0|Quick and easy read that gives an inside view of the nightmare that is North Korea.  This should be what we are hearing on the evening news, not who Kim Kardashian is dating or what's the latest belly fat buster.  These people live in slavery year after year and never have a decent meal.  They are locked into a medieval hell.  Wake up, America.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I have been a fan of Ian Fleming's book for decades.  Stevenson has a done a masterful job of capturing the exploits of Iam Fleming that led up to the James Bond series.<br />Can't wait to read Operation Uncle Sam.
B007N85POS|4.0|Nice game, however doesn't has access to the toons tv's with my soon love and enjoy more than the game, actually.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|Interesting read. It's not a very long book so it didn't take too long to read. Interesting insights on business and some what not to dos.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Early in this book I thought it was going to be very predictable.  Wrong! The plot has layer after layer of subtlety,keeping you guessing.Gillian Flynn is an excellent writer.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I cannot put it down!  It is very addictive. Love the challenge.TIme sems to really fly by. Plan on playing for a long while.
1439153663|5.0|A wonderful read, with characters that are mystically revealed to this writer; she says they wrote the book, not her.  Kathleen Grissom is a talented and warm individual offering a portrait of life inside a slave kitchen that will warm and break your heart.  I loved it.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Not having grown up in the 80's but hang kids who did, I found this entertaining. A dark vision of the future with some suspenseful moments and yet, light entertainment with a feel good ending.
B00BXDOSXS|2.0|Didn't works to see the video extensions that I want, but is a friendly software.<br />Maybe works for other person needs
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|They start out three separate women living three separate lives but then their worlds collide and weave together in the most brilliant and astounding way. A brilliant and unique novel- a must read.
1401922732|4.0|After reading Assertiveness for Earth Angels by Doreen Virtue, I wanted to get my Archangel Michael Oracle Cards because Doreen references Archangel Michael in the protection session of the before-mentioned book.  These cards are very accurate, powerful, and healing.  In one card, I could actually feel the healing rays of the sun itself.  Great deck - pure and unadulterated.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|This has got to be the worse Patricia Cornwell book that I have ever read!  I'm only into it about 23% on my Kindle, but since it is paid for, I feel like I have to finish.  Hopefully, it will get better!
0446693804|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book!! It made me laugh, it made me cry, and everything else in between. The story begins with 17 year-old Landon Carter attending Beaufort High-school. Landon is the typical &#34;rebel&#34;. He enrolls in drama class in the mindset that he'd get an easy A. Turns out, he was one of the only boys in the class. He notices Jamie Sullivan from across the room. She's the preachers daughter and gets tormented for it daily. He has known of her all of his life, but never really noticed her.. until today.<br />Landon never planned on going to homecoming, but he found out because he was class president he had to go. He needed a date and fast. Jamie was the only girl left when it comes time for the homecoming dance. Although not his first choice and the fact that he's running out of time, Landon asks Jamie to be his date. Her agreement became the crucial moment, the pedal that got the wheel to spinning, the stepping stone to one of the most beautiful and courageous love stories ever written. To find out all the twists and turns of the story, i encourage you to read this book!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom always brings his point home.  The Time Keeper really puts moral values in perspective.  I highly recommend this reading to others whom are a fan of Mitch's writing.
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|The movie was good if you like courtroom drama. The actors played their parts well and there was a good story line. Matt Damon is so cute in this movie. Danny DaVito was excellent!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive and fun to play. Recommend the commenting to Facebook, that way you don't have to pay to play, your friends send you what you need.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|very fun game for adults, but too tough for kids &#60; 10 probably.  I find the sound effects pretty funny.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|The funniest chirstmas movie ever! Chevy chase is quite funny! I laughed all the way through the movie! I love when Chevy chase comes down the disc so fast!
B00D6QUMWG|3.0|Anna Netrebko is the \\"It Girl\\" (or perhaps the \\"It Diva\\") of our age.  She's beautiful, charismatic, and oh, what a voice.  I've only seen her in person once, when she sang Gounod's Juliette, and all I could think of is that she's much better than the role she's singing.  The voice is huge; she moves from head tones to chest tones (and back again) seamlessly, and she's just got \\"it\\"; when she sings, you listen, riveted.<br /><br />For all these reasons, and probably many more, people couldn't wait for this \\"first foray\\" into Verdi.  I find that surprising, because my recollection is that one of her early successes was the Salzburg Traviata.  Her recording (with Villazon) is wonderful - gorgeous and dramatic to the max.<br /><br />In any case, the buzz was there, and given her many virtues I really wanted to flip out over this recording.  (Among other things, I don't like too many recital recordings, but hers have always been the exception to that rule.)  However, it's not perfect.  Her Lady Macbeth is pure Netrebko - riveting.  But some of the other arias are just so-so; great singing, but not much dramatic involvement.  I got the impression that where she really hasn't gotten into the character all that deeply, she's going through the motions rather than investing her entire being into the aria, which she usually does so often (and so well).  I'd love to hear a re-recording of this in about five or 10 years, when she's actually sung the roles in question on stage; for the time being, though I'll happily settle for a recording that is \\"only\\" gorgeous singing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Sad and glorious, highest highs and unbelievable lows, a  seemingly righteous account of the political, but also the private lives which were intertwined during Hitler's great campaign to mold a master race.  Insightful,
B004EKCNMA|4.0|Close to the book.  Dark. But flight with rocket-like travel?  It is a good movie, well made, and keeps close to the book, but it is not the book - obviously. Carrey is pretty good, and does not go over the top, but holds it in really well.  Being a fan of the book I can think of other actors I would like to see portray Scrooge, but Carrey does a good job.  There are a couple of 'additions' to help the flow, but it is a good film and does treat the book with respect.  The only bit I did not like was when Scrooge went flying off like a rocket to his next destination with the dark horses chasing him.  It seems over the top Hollywood crap added for action and no other reason, but that is only one scene out of many really good scenes. SO I forgive it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best works and that's saying a lot. He is the best at painting a picture of the legal system and processes in the South, particularly the law as practiced and enforced in the rural South. He humanizes the practice of law and turns it into compelling, page-turning story-telling with his typical protagonist and antagonists painted with bright colors that only a very good writer can do. Believe it or not, in Sycamore Row Grisham takes the dull and mind-numbing terrain of probate law and bends and crafts it into a story chock full of suspense, and can't-put-it-down interest. If you like Grisham's brand of legal fiction, you'll love this book. If you haven't read anything of Grisham's but think you'd like to give him a try, this is the one to sample taste.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video upon a recommendation from a friend.  She's a dancer (flamenco), and is required to stay in shape.  She said that only using the easy version (there are three levels on here), she stays in great shape.  I love it because I am insanely uncoordinated when it comes to exercise videos, and i always feel lost.  This video is so easy, but so effective.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an allover workout.  My husband has also done this video with me, and while he is in shape, it is a major workout for him too!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Although I wasn't a fan of The Walking Dead at first, I am now a believer! Great season! Can't wait for season 4!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very entertaining. I read this book in two nights; I did not want to put it down. The story had a few places that were a bit unbelievable, but then again, so does real life, right? :)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Absolutely great book.  Keeps you reading long past when you would like to quit.  Takes you into the law in an enjoyable way
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|This is a fun game. Same as the Facebook one. Money takes awhile to earn imo. Game play is good though and I have not had any tech issues. Would recommend to anyone.
0061950726|3.0|The story has been explained by many reviewers and while I agree that parts of it were really well written and interesting - it was a page turner  - I found many other elements contrived and a bit too &#34;easy&#34;. It seems to all tie up neatly in a after-school-speical bow.<br /><br />I found this particularly the case with Molly. First, her name is an Irish-American name (connection with Vivian..a little too convenient) and then her foster mom is a bit too full of stereotypes for me and Molly is stereotyped a bit too much for me, too. As she becomes more at peace with her life ,she becomes less goth and more &#34;normal&#34;, which really seemed like lazy writing and really expected character development.<br /><br />There is one aspect of the book with which I disagree is realistic in any sense of the word, but it would spoil the book so I'll stop here.<br /><br />Definitely a page turner and enjoyable. But  great literature? Not by my estimation. Author could have done better.
B005DJREJS|5.0|This show is witty and I love how it's narrated by the main character. It's like Gilmore Girls main charter, Rory, is narrating her public high school experience before she went to private school. My daughter and I love it!
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Season 4 of the Walking Dead was good for the most part. It dragged just a little when the Governer's character was being reintroduced. All in all I think it was a great season. I can't wait to see more in the future!
1250037751|3.0|Your mileage will vary mainly depending on your technical knowledge.  The beginning of the book is funny and charming, helped by the first-person narration.  Some of the Google references (Google itself is one of the main themes) are interesting and close to the truth, but most are just too unbelievable (and wrong).  The book's understanding of coding and problem-solving is weak to the point that even non-programmers know better. It started very promising, but I almost didn't finish it.
B005UA0FLE|4.0|Christmas has been done! And really this disc is typical of the season. It has a little different flavor but you have heard it before.  Buble has a buttery voice.  Love to listen to him warble.  It is worth the7$  .
B00355L2TU|4.0|It's not really 30 minutes but its a good work out and one can keep moving up with her videos.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting is wonderful ,love the women's fashions, and the story line is exciting. I can't wait for Season 4.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Thank you Veronica Roth for delivering another amazing book in this series. I have loved every minute I spent with these characters and they will live in my heart forever, especially Tris.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Loved this game until I leveled up from 74 to 75 it reset and I stayed on level 75 but had no money or domains.  Haven't really played since. Well see if I get back into it like I was before.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This game will hook you and confound you.  Be prepared to be hooked.  Don't open it at work or be prepared to be unemployed!
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Enjoyable Sci-Fi series that brings a new level to science fiction series, interesting subjects and excellent humor without any over drawn blood and guts, and crappy humor.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a wonderful novel from an excellent author, Ken Follett. This novel is as well written as his other works.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|OK - I might be biased because I'm a tech - but this is seriously the best book I've read in twenty years, It has action aplenty, with delightful tech twists - talk about throwing us a bone when (minor spoiler) the deamon takes out all the spammers! If you have even a passing interest in where technology might take us and are interested in topical political questions like the struggle between our democracy and the plutocrats and secret government organizations and would like a revenge tale along the lines of Quentin Tarantino's last two films - in book form - pick this up pronto! And don't forget to buy the sequel - Freedom - because the story is incomplete without it.
0064430227|5.0|Classic children's story.  Packed well.  Story is even more fun than when I first read it many years ago. Fun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and thankfully gets harder. Wish there were some tips on what special pieces and combos do - it would save me some lives.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It is a very sweet movie with an interesting take on the reality of Santa Claus - no swearing, sex or anything that may interfere with a family's values. Natalie Woods as a child no less does an excellent acting performance, We watch it almost every Christmas holiday.
B00GX598FO|1.0|Terrible follow up movie, the cast is back except Morgan Freeman and Karl Urban are missing.  The whole story line is about Mary-Louise Parker & Bruce Willis.  Helen Mirren and Brian Cox are in but a few moments as if just thrown in.  John Malkovich is in the whole movie, but terribly wasted in this movie compared to the previous movie. Byung-hun Lee, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Anthony Hopkins are wasted in being the bad guys and ex love interest of Bruce Willis's character.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|One of the best cop stories I have ever seen, packed with great actors, great human personalities, real life stories that you can live on.<br />The settings are beautiful, the back ground music is very peaceful and restful. Too bad CBS doesn't like the way Jesse handles criminals, and will not make another film.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I am giving it 5 stars because I love the game. The thing is I had already got the FREE Star Wars Angry Birds which is EXACTLY like this one. I wasted 99 cents and if I could find a telephone number to call Amazon I would call and get it back. I know, it is only 99 cents but why oh why are they selling it when it is FREE!!??? I thought I was getting extra levels and characters but no, not happening,
0763644765|5.0|My kids still LOVE this book and they have been potty trained a long time.  So cute and really got my two interested in using the potty.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Not only is Chris Colfer an amazing actor in Glee, but he is an amazing author, too! This is  a must-read for everyone, young and old. This is one of the best books of all time, no dought about that. Read this book!
B00G70JQZC|5.0|I was only a comic reader for about 15 years, starting in the early 1980s. It was a time when &#34;graphic novels&#34; had started to issue with very adult themes and serious character development, not all BAM POW BOP. In all honesty, at times The Uncanny Xmen, one of the titles I did read, was like a soap opera with moody character conversations about being lonely cast-outs in a hostile world.<br /><br />That being said, I loved the series I read and it was a time when the events in this movie had already taken place - Kitty and Wolverine was an early maxi-series for me - and so I tend to prefer a balance of fight scenes and character development. Especially in comparison to its prequel, this movie is thoughtful and shows Logan as a person, with clear motives and sensible reactions to things. Anyone looking for 120 minutes of RAWR and fighting will be reasonably disappointed and should go play a video game instead. It portrays him as a man with feelings trying to sort out his place in a world he dislikes but was drawn into by a rare event - falling for Jean Grey.<br /><br />I'd think even people who don't like comics could enjoy this one, with the exception of the final battle which gets a little geeky and &#34;comicey.&#34; As a side note, when comics started introducing super-wealthy characters with secret labs it was a lot harder to buy than it is now with our ever-increasing income disparity in the world and billionaires running around. The only real &#34;technical&#34; objection I saw with the movie was several instances where Logan's tracking instincts - smell and intuition - would have come into play but were not included. Whatever - it would have made the movie less accessible for some audiences.<br /><br />If you want non-stop mindless action battle scenes you'll be disappointed, but so many of these comic adaptations suffer from a loss of connection between the characters' back stories and their actions because there's not enough time to develop the storyso the actions seem inauthentic or disconnected. Overall I think this is one of the best superhero/mutant films we've had, in part due to the script and also to the fine acting of Hugh - who we're lucky to have in our generation to portray Logan. Here we get a great movie all around. Bravo.
B00FQMVCEA|5.0|Another Great film by Pixar, if you haven't seen this and are a animation fan, you must see it a great story.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Great movie. I had always seen bits and pieces of it. Saw it on Amazon and decided to rent it for free through hitbliss.<br />Very little dialogue, but the message is there. Mr. Wells would be proud of the message.
B0087FMUCQ|1.0|I have the kindle fire hd.  The graphic are great and I had no play issues.  This is not golf, it's more like hit the bullseye.  This game you only get one shot per hole. Your goal is to get the required pts to unlock the next coarse. This game does not have much replay value. I did see a couple on unneeded permissions. Why does this need to write to an external storage when there is no save game options???? I would turn off wi-fi while playing to be safe.  I would also get this while it's the FAOTD.<br /><br />NO Wi-Fi required.<br /><br />update<br /><br />1st, the need to writing to external storage is to save your high score.<br /><br />2nd, the makers of this game Full Fat has there name and there logo all through this game. They even advertise there other app in this game. For these reason, this game is an automatic 1 star.
B000002KDO|5.0|the early sabbath album.this is there 3rd studio album.this album was released in 1971.this is some classic sabbath.what a great band.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I wish that you could do more things if I were u I would search Pou it's a really good game do not do the one with the mustache. Actually I think temple run 2 is just like temple run.....
B00GLX0Z8C|4.0|Just fun for all.  Good movie to just relax and laugh with.  I'm glad we found it.  Wife and I enjoyed it together.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book answered many questions I had about the earliest Christian community and about its differences with the teachings of Paul.
B007R11DKQ|4.0|This is a really nice family movie.  We enjoyed it a great deal.  It has witches (not too scary), a princess, a hero, and many other interesting characters.  Recommended!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This read is one that will stay with you and make you remember that first love again, but only the good parts!
B000001EKX|3.0|this is kisses 2nd studio album.this album came out in 1974.i was 9 at that time.lol.but if you like that old kinda raw rock n roll.this is a decent album.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie will go on for ever.  It is all about the magic of Christmas if you still believe.  My granddaughter will have her first<br />Polar Express ride this year, what better way to start it off with this movie.<br />You can be 100 and still believe.....in the magic.  I love it and I do still believe
B00EK3EFEA|5.0|Birch is an amazing talent, and seeing her live is proof. While some artists pale in comparison to their studio work, Birch is better in person (and that's saying a lot!) She is the real deal. When she launched her first national tour, her first stop was in one of LA's small clubs. Standing 3 feet from her, I was blown away by her authenticity as an artist.<br /><br />Singer songwriters expose their soul and take us on a journey with each successive album, but often the second album falls sort. While Birch's freshman effort, Bible Belt, featured an eclectic mix of both blues inspired and pop-worthy songs, Speak a Little Louder is a more mature and serious effort. If there's a criticism of the album it is that it is too serious, bordering on melancholy. But it is her story; between Bible Belt and Speak a Little Louder there has been a lot of life lived, with tragedy and heartbreak. There's a sense that you are staring into her soul, and sharing grief and disappointment and, yes, eventual but hard won victory-in-progress. Definitely not falling short, Speak a Little Louder doesn't exactly soar, but it builds anticipation for more from Birch.<br /><br />Bible Belt brought comparisons to Carly Simon and Laura Nyro, but listeners will find Birch's impressive vocals tinged with a Stevie Nicks quality on Speak a Little Louder. The arrangements feature heavy bass lines and impressive percussion and - of course - Birch's great keyboard skills. Unlike the second efforts of KT Tunstall or Duffy, Birch has improved, and I can't wait for more.
B002XXUWMI|3.0|Dark City was good but not quite outstanding. If you enjoyed The Thirteenth Floor, The Matrix trilogy and even The Truman Show, you will like this one. Alternate realities and manipulative bad guys abound. Things aren't what they seem and Rufus Sewell's character fights to save himself and everyone else in the Dark City.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I learned from this book. I invite you to read it and learn lessons for yourself. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I absolutely love this game. One problem I can't use the extra moves I've been gifted. Please fix this. Other than that great app
B000002KET|5.0|this album is where sabbath somewhat changed there sound.this is in my opion is where they started they chaned into the later days of sabbath.
B008469DGY|5.0|Who thought that flicking your finger could be so much fun? It's the details that make this game great - the ambient sounds, the colorful graphics, and just the right physics make this one of my favorite Android games.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved how the book had all the suspense because Peeta almost died like 3 times and there were some nice and sneaky traitors in the book.
B007MC8YLQ|3.0|Downloaded the new FreeCell because I have played the old version for years and love it.  Was really disappointed in the new one.  It's ok but not near as fast as the old - just wasn't (to me) near as much fun.  I've since deleted the newer one and gone back to what I had before.
B008602KQI|3.0|The story was strange, yet a little interesting. I did not read the book, but I am not sure it would have made a difference. This story was not quite my cup of tea. Too much like Holocaust wannabe somewhat.. It was just okay for me.
B000002KHH|5.0|black sabbath 2nd studio.and of there greatest albums and one of the more sabbath fans like as far as the old sabbath is concerned.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Just when you think you have heard it all from Tom Scholz, he turns it up a notch! The founder of Boston has managed to pull out all the stops and launch his army of guitars once more. The vocals are loud and clear, the instrumentals are focused, precise and compelling. This is a must have cd. The music is fresh! Its up! It makes you want to listen over and over. Great piece of work.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Great action and special effects.  There is an age old story line as well.  Hopefully this spins off in a good direction.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Oh my gosh, what a relief to be able to look and see just how life my battery has left.  Used to have to guess at it and was surprised (and often disappointed) to be in the middle of reading a book or playing a game and be told that it was time to recharge my battery.  I still get the same message, of course, but now am prepared for it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I seriously couldn't stop playing! Puzzles are challenging. Storyline is creepy and interesting and the graphics and sound effects are great. Now i either need The Room 2 or I need to find more games like it!
B000002KE2|5.0|this is some classic black sabbath.the god fathers of heavy metal.i really like this album.my favorite song on here is the song supernault.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive. But now it wont let me progress onward! Not cool. Friends have to help me out but they think the requests are annoying on facebook so they ignore them. So I am virtually stuck on this level even though I have passed it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Loved it, could not stop watching it.  Can't wait until I can see the next season is free on Prime.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Just what you expect from a Star Trek movie--lots of action and special effects. I liked the way it tied characters (bad guys) from &#34;future&#34; adventures into the narrative.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I felt this movie goes against type for Denzel. From the previews I expected a hero's story. The pilot in this movie is not a likeable character. His demons are not offset by excellent reflexes.
B000002KB8|5.0|this album is where it started it all.there first album.this album came out in 1970.if you want the real deal.this is it.the god fathers of heavy metal.
0062255657|5.0|This was an amazing book.  I have read almost all of Neil's books and I loved this one.  I am not going to go into a lot of detail.  What I found amazing was that this is a story told by a child but through the eyes of an adult.  Who can do that?  I became the boy, in some way I was looking through my own childhood eyes.  Thank you Mr. Gaiman ... can I have some more?
1476733953|2.0|Ok first off I enjoyed the writing. It was clean and flowed very nicely. It would have been such a joy to have this good a writer write something better.<br /><br />But how in the world so many people give this 5 stars is beyond me. Who wants to live in this authors world? It's depressing as heck. A bunch of people living in a huge silo underground because the air outside is toxic. Anyone ever seen the Matrix? Because that's what this is without the machines or the Matrix. And character development? No there isn't. We don't learn anything about these people. Heck they could all be the same person just with different names.<br /><br />So who should read this book? People who like dark depressing stuff and have lots of free time on their hands.
B007EC27QM|3.0|only does the very basic functions so its not up to what i really wanted in a calculator. but tis fine for basic math.
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|(Rounded up from 3-1/2 stars, Spoiler Alert) This movie was rare in that I started to lose some hope about midway through, but it recovered in time for a nice finish.  Spoiler Alert! Let's start with some minor negatives.  There are questionable extramarital relationships by both spouses (played by the surprisingly dramatic, and funny, Steve Carell and the always dependable Julianne Moore); whether that was justifiable is up to the viewer.  Also, Oscar winner Marisa Tomei (Supporting Actress, &#34;My Cousin Vinny&#34;) is good and cute here, but I'm not sure why she'd take such a small, seemingly insignificant supporting role (she's a big enough star to &#34;carry&#34; movies in starring roles).  The positives, however, are the rest of the supporting cast, including I-can't-help-it-if-I'm-good-looking-but-I-can-act-too Ryan Gosling, Kevin Bacon (1984's &#34;Footloose&#34;), and Emma Stone, all representing some of life's complex relationships with appealing performances, with the generally original script also being a strength (at least, it's not the same, tired story you see in most comedy-dramas).  There's also a special surprise for fans of &#34;Dirty Dancing.&#34;  Recommended and, rest assured, worth your time.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|And who wouldn't? Charles dickens is such a free, beautiful writer and that is why this is a classic. 5 stars all the way. Buy this book ( did I mention its FREE on kindle) so you can experience the true meaning of Christmas and a truly beautiful book you are bound to fall in love with.
B000683VI4|4.0|great movie! it is kind of a &#34;girl&#34; movie but my husband likes it as well. I would tell people to see it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Relax Melodies is awesome--especially for blocking out hotel noise when I travel. I find that by turning on my favorite sounds an hour ahead of my bedtime, my body's circadian rhythms are primed and ready for sleep when I turn out the light.<br /><br />It's one of my favorite apps, and I'm glad I've made it part of my nights.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Okay, so I've been a King devotee since the release (in hardback ) of The Shining. While I would had dubbed Doctor Sleep a King read without awareness of the author, I feel the character development is more interesting  and somehow different (better?) than other books he's penned. I loved this book and likely I not alone when I find my hopes raising to follow Dan, Abra and the others through some more of life's challenges as their characters lives continue to evolve. Thank you Mr. King for the hundreds of hours of entertainment and joy your writing has infused into my life. My gratitude cannot be overstated. To you, your bride and your children, take care.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is the best I like it so much I play it all the time, great game love it
B00GIY5OGC|2.0|Cute but weak story line.  Kids didn't really care for it much. Weak story.  Do not bother to waste your money.
B00A757EFW|4.0|its ok, I don't play it much. but it is fun. My son likes to play it and he does have fun with it.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Great dogfights, beautiful shots of the F-14, good plot, great music.  If you're a redblooded American male, this movie is almost guaranteed to make you want to join the Navy and become a fighter pilot.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love the gritty quality of the lead singer's voice and I love this whole cd....glad I purchased since my daughter likes their music as well.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games of all time  I think you guys will like it too so you should get it cause if you don't I will destroy you so yeah get it
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fun puzzle game worth the free I got it for. I got it thru the Amazon app store on a day they had it for free.
B000B0WO0I|1.0|The sample online music of this selected Simply Red CD is a completely different version from the songs received. Not very happy with what was received!!!!Hope Amaazon will switch for another Simply Red CD and the correct version I was expecting to receive.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|It took a couple of listens to get used to Paul's obviously declining voice, but once I got past the grieving period and started listening to the album for what it is I quite enjoyed it.  Stand out tracks are 'Save Us', 'Alligator', 'Queenie Eye', 'Early Days', and 'New'.  If you like Paul this is a must buy!
B008R14YBK|5.0|this is one of my daughter's favorite artists.  she plays this cd ALL the time.  even I know every song pretty much  word for word.  she wishes amazon would carry the deluxe version with the dvd.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I loved Royals and decided to buy the mp3 version album when it went on sale for $4.99. I absolutely love it! Good beats and lyrics. It's my favorite new album. Thinking about buying the CD version too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Gives me all the info I need in a timely manner. Laid out logically and intuitively, looks very good on Kindle.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Fresh spin on what looked to be your standard &#34;group of buddies pull of heists&#34; type of movie. Good chemistry among the actors. We all enjoyed the fact that each magician had a specialty that they brought to the table. Give it a go, you won't be disappointed.
B001HN6918|4.0|Cute.  Love these movies when they offer a little something for the adults too.  Very cute DVD - purchased as a gift.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|Ewan McGregor's voice is fantastic.  I bought it for his singing alone and the fact that I gave away my original copy.  The 80's song references mixed together with the broadway musical type numbers is interesting.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is awesome. Listing, checking, paying is all made easy. I would recommend to all ebayers!!!<br />Try it and you'll see
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Highly recommend this product.  For the functionality and the fact that they are putting out new and useful applications that can sync with the device and cast to it.
B00FVVR2ZO|3.0|PLEASE FIX KINDLE FIRE UPDATE.  MAYBE THAN I WOULD GIVE A BETTER RATING. THE RATING I GAVE WAS TO HIGH.  Also should be a better way to get diamonds, and why can't I continue my kindle game on Facebook?
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This is a great, high quality toy. My 5-year-old loves it and plays with it all the time. He likes to put anything and everything in the dumper and drive it around the house or yard. It even helps at cleanup time! The detail on it is great but it is still sturdy enough to stand up to our 2-year-old too.
0316074314|3.0|The first thing you notice about Eleanor Catton's [[ASIN:0316074314 The Luminaries: A Novel (Man Booker Prize)]] is its style, an at first intriguing recreation of 19th century storytelling, both in the language and in the slow, calculated feeding of information appearing as sensational developments.  Ultimately, though, it's this focus on technique and mimicry that turns the book into a long crawl through the 19th century New Zealand gold rush community of Hokitika.  What begins as fascination gets lost in wordiness.  And while Catton populates the novel with a large and diverse cast of characters, none really strike you as compelling, the kind of person, good or bad, you must know everything about, and whom you care about what becomes of them.<br /><br />People today certainly are pleased to read long novels but maybe not so pleased to read very longwinded mysteries filled with old style plot contrivances (try shot though a curtain unbeknownst to others in the room).  That the world moves faster today and communication is more telegraphed (ironically a 19th century invention) are givens.  It's also that people read novels differently these days, in paper tomes or on electronic pads, the entire novel complete in hand.  Dickens, and the like, spewed forth reams of pages; however, typically these novels first appeared serialized in the journals of the day, such as Dickens's All the Year Round (in which Wilkie Collins's three best known \\"sensation\\" novels appeared).  Cliffhanging section endings were a necessity, as Dickens and the others knew they had to engage and keep the reader engaged to create desire for the next installment, much like today's serial television dramas do.  Later, the serializations appeared in book form with a ready audience.<br /><br />That's not to say the long novel has outstayed its welcome.  Plenty of very good long novels, such as Donna Tartt's compelling [[ASIN:0316055433 The Goldfinch]], Joyce Carol Oates's riveting [[ASIN:0062234358 The Accursed: A Novel]], and Tom Wolfe's raffish [[ASIN:0316036331 Back to Blood: A Novel]], to cite a few, currently weigh down shelves or hold doors open.  Despite winning the Man Booker, despite the dazzling writing style, and despite Catton's impressive command of 19th century mining, shipping, financial, and settlement matters, the novel doesn't engage you enough to propel you from page one to page 830 as the others do or as the best 19th century novels do.<br /><br />The novel's prodigious page count lays out roughly as follows:  the first 600 pages present the mystery of the missing boyish millionaire, the dead hermit in the cabin, and the whore found near death in the street.  Something is afoot here and we are to piece it together as the various characters receive and dispense vital information.  From around 600 to 700 everything becomes clear in a trial that's well done and perhaps the best part of the book.  However, if things aren't clear enough for you, Catton devotes the final 130 pages to retelling the story in linear fashion.<br /><br />Whether you should devote the time to the novel is entirely up to you.  You might wish to skim it first before spending several days, depending on the reading time available to you, to read it.  It's not that the novel isn't good, it's just that it's more dazzle than substance.Accursed: A Novel]], and Tom Wolfe's raffish [[ASIN:0316036331 Back to Blood: A Novel]], to cite a few, currently weigh down shelves or hold doors open.

B00EO2I6XS|2.0|To avoid any erroneous expectations, be aware that this film delves only tangentially into Eichmann's actual capture, trial and execution.  Conversely, as noted by the title itself, the focus is biographical-- dealing primarily with Arendt's life, philosophy and controversial writings.  Perhaps because of the subject matter and/or the acting, things move at a torpid pace.  As such, there is a kind of a stuffy, unexciting and bland flavor to this film. A very slow moving affair overall.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Here's the deal for me.  I don't care what directors producers and actors, actresses and others wanted to do with or in the movie.  I have one way of evaluating a movie.  Did I like it?  Cavil was a decent S-man.  Zod actor was good.  Crowe was good.  Others in the movie were so-so, including Costner and Lane.  Amy Adams, probably a decent actress in other movies, was seriously not good in this one.  The kiss between Cavil and Adams had no fire whatever.  It was like a couple teenagers sharing their first one.  The best Lois Lane was Kate Bosworth. Should have kept her.  Fight scenes were endless and a bit boring, though I can't deny the great CGI involvement.  And here's my final test.  Would I watch the movie again?  NO!

B00GO8ZHJG|5.0|Dr. Who is such a vital, living creature, it's almost too easy to hand out glowing reviews for the vast majority of episodes since the reboot with the Ninth Doctor. But this one-off, peek behind the curtain at the show's humble beginnings is not to be missed. David Bradley (Game of Thrones, Broadchurch) as William Hartnell gives a performance that is both uplifting and heartbreaking. The little bits here and there that echo some of the finest work of the modern day writing staff will never leave you -- don't want to give the Big One away. Just watch it. You will be glad you did. Best $2.99 I ever spent.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I really like this game.  Finding the maps has been a problem though. It's fun throwing that annoying Jar Jar Binks around.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Lets face it, the quality of the Boston albums (the few that there are) have been steady declining since Don't Look Back.  Perhaps breaking up the original lineup coincides with this?  I realize Tom Scholz writes/wrote most/all of the music and produces, and you keep hoping he can put something out that is somewhat close to the first two albums in quality, but this album fails on all fronts.  The songs are forgettable, the production poor (the drum sound is horrendous), the mix of singers is none too impressive.

007174889X|5.0|Very comprehensive and up to date on all the topics (for internal medicine, that is). The only problem is because there is just too much new knowledge over time, so some important topics are &#34;off-loaded&#34; onto the accompanying CD. And I have misplaced that. So until I can locate that CD, I am ignorant of such things as poisoning and environmental toxins, among other things. Oh well, I hope they can expand the next edition to three or more volumes instead so I won't misplace my CD.

B00ERH15WY|4.0|I am the target audience for this album - a Bad Religion fan for 2 decades and a Christmas carol-loving non-believer - so it was pretty much inevetable that I would love this. I was grinning and shouting along for the whole album. One thing I will say is some of the press reviews have suggested that Graffin and company have somehow \\"de-Godded\\" these traditional carols, which is not the case. In some cases the lyrics are slightly different from what I personally grew up with, but not materially so (things like Magi vs. Wise Men), but all of the Christ, God and Jesus references are intact.<br /><br />ETA: I wanted to edit this, because on reflection, I actually really agree with some of the more substantive fan criticisms of this album - primarily that is is too short, particularly since \\"American Jesus\\" has never been one of my favorite songs. Also, \\"White Christmas\\" really does kill the rhythm right in the middle of the album. It is still tons of fun and I listened the heck out of it last December and anticipate doing so again, but in retrospect, I'm not sure it's really a 5-star effort.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is chill. People need to get this game. So glad it was available for kindle. About time it was available.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to read mockingjay! And see the movie!<br />This series incredible and worth the time and money. Girl on fire!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Although deceptively simple, Carcassonne is both challenging and frustratingly addictive. A bad combination to stumble upon for the last couple weeks of the semester. I've been sucked in...
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|this app keeps crashing when i try to make a video. It seems like a good app but if i can't make a video with it it's a waste of my time. please fix this.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Great, easy-to-use app for seeing current weather and long-term / short-term forecast. Some features--such as maps and pollen counts--don't work as well in app as they do on TWC website.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So, very easy to use.  The cost was incredibly low for the value that this item offers.  Glad I ordered it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Wills are tough law to practice in, but Grisham NAILS it!  Without a doubt this was a hard book to write, as will and such are not required coursework in law school.  I have read all of his books on law, and find, without a doubt, this to be in the top 3, if not the best!  While many authors slack off after a few bestsellers, Grisham does not fall into the category.  His descriptions and working the characters into the book are second to none!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first then read the first book. I thought they were very close to each other but enjoyed the extra added detail. it gave me more insight into the characters' background.
B000GCFD72|4.0|He makes interesting points, I will definitely be more aware of how i interact in certain ways with my kids.
B005HED08I|5.0|After all this time Star Trek Original is still one of the best sci-fi series out there, it is timeless
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|In part, the premise and plot of this story are a bit simplistic, but I found this story to be very compelling and provocative, because I can see that it could generate a lot of discussion about transparency and what it might do to us (already is doing?). I expected better writing from Dave Eggers and even more complex characters. However, I found it hard to put the book down - for me it was a page turner.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Although Tombstone is my favorite Wyatt Earp story, this one with Kevin Costner is great also. Goes into much greater detail regarding Earps early years. It's NOT just about the OK Corral and it's aftermath
B00G70WLJA|5.0|This takes you AND the Wolverine way back and then up to the present to unravel the already fraying psyche of this Xman, and then reweave it into new and whole cloth, in a very human way. Battling himself, other warriors, and some pretty intense inner demons, Wolverine is every hurting, lonely, despairing, and then honorable and heroic bit you ever hoped he was. Superb movie.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|A good book for anyone interested in problems of managing complex systems.  The reference to Perrow puts it in an appropriate context.  Once again the issue is less technological than human.  Part of the problem with widespread availability is that safety guidelines are either not available or not widely known.
B0045XICB2|5.0|One of the best of its kind  EVER! I have read (and reread) all of the series numerous times; watched the DVDs and the supplemental disks several times. This is an outstanding series and I look forward to anything  the Author man offer in the future!!
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I found this to be an absolutely charming and moving love story.  Couple that with chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt and this is a movie I will watch many times over.  The score by Thomas Newman (WALL-E, Little Women, American Beauty, Shawshank Redemption, and even Skyfall) is a huge bonus.<br /><br />What's funny too is that the explanation behind what happens in this movie would normally be a turn-off for me, but it's handled so beautifully that I didn't mind it at all.
B005KITK6C|5.0|It's Lego.  Do I need any other reason to like this product?  Full disclosure - my son hasn't opened it yet.  That said, however, my 7 year old son does his homework.  He watches the videos on how the legos are made; he has his favorite people who create Legos - there is even one guy who creeps him out but he makes cool Lord of the Rings stuff so he tolerates him.  My son requested this for Christmas so he'll see it then.
630460288X|5.0|One of my favorite movies from the 90's. I wish they would have revisited the world with a sequel or other time in.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|I kept waiting for this story to captivate me...for me to get the intended message, to appreciate the journey. I must have missed something because this book and I never really clicked.  It wasn't bad, mind, just not my cuppa.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|so far we had no problems.  I hope this problem will be solved for a least 2-3 years. Thank-you very much.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Started off a little slow but the action keeps building.  The ending was had parts that were unenexpected and sad but what keep you coming back for more.
B00EKJWS1Q|1.0|First, this is not a Microsoft product. After loading, lots of ad pop ups showed up even with my blocker on. Had to delete and clear my cache. Also, the right side of my screen began flickering like crazy. After gone, everything works fine again.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is an amazing movie. It's a shame it didn't do well when it was in theaters, pick this up and be thrilled by the intense action and gritty futuristic setting.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  I think Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson are geniuses and artists of the first order.  The film will make your HDTV look better than it has any right to.  I look forward to any further work these film makers produce.
B0089LOG02|5.0|As usual, once again I learned something about the history of our country, that I didn't know, and that we shouldn't really be very proud of. That being said, I enjoy historial novels and this one was very good. Some bad, some good, some bitter sweet, but a wonderful, get out the tissues ending! All in all just a good story that kept me reading. I recommended it to my book club, some good stuff for discussion.
B004ZGI18S|5.0|My husband and I did not know a thing about this movie.  We were just trying to find something interesting to watch.  At first we thought we had the plot figured out and it would be boring from then on.  What a surprise for us, the last few minutes are a shocker.  I will not tell any about it because everyone needs to see it for themselves.  We don't know why this movie was not better promoted.  I have ordered this for a stocking stuffer for one of my daughter and son-in-law. If you like mystery, this is for you.
B00555X8OA|5.0|I am a fan of Dr Kahneman, clear ideas very well explained, very useful to understand how the mind works
B000OVLBEO|4.0|This is a fun movie even though it diverges from much of the Ghost Rider comic cannon. Nicolas Cage does a good job of playing Johnny Blaze.
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|Excellent and brilliant production. Emotional, True to form. On my ancient TV I need the subtitles just to back up the story line so I shouldn't miss any account of this brilliant production.<br /> The CD I purchased from Amazon was for my niece and nephew.<br /> My sister said they are old enough for Billy Elliot. And So----I surprised them with the gift.<br /> All is well . The children were thrilled as, I was in love with the production.<br />Thanks,<br />Vic
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|Evil deal really brought it. I was skeptical as they were re-booting a classic. But they did an amazing job. Even critics likes this movie and they never like horror movies. The acting was solid, story was well directory and written, special effects were amazing and the action started almost right away. No sitting around waiting to get grabbed. Get ready for a thrill ride. Well done for a re-make
B002HEOLFW|5.0|Love, love, love this singer. He is awesome!!! I'm a realtively new fan and came across his music on accident when looking for another song. So glad I found Daughtry's music. I may be a new fan, but I'm a HUGE fan!!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Great 3d movie to watch. Action and some humor . I recommend it. The 3D comes out great with vivid colors.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|First of all, I hardly ever watch rated R movies, and would have eliminated this movie entirely on that fact had I not read other reviews. The reasons it was rated R, I believe, are some of the themes may be considered graphic, but for the most part, they did not show them. The insinuation itself may have been what made the rating go from PG-13 to R. I've watched many PG-13 movies that I would consider far more graphic, sexual, or violent than this one, and this one did not warrant an R rating on any of those grounds stand alone, much less together. But, they have their reasons for the rating, so I will leave it at that. I watched this with my teenage boys, and they loved it. The reaction to injustices, and the internal motivations to overcome the present, and the standing ground on good morals when the world around you is not, are the lessons that can be learned by kids watching this movie. Virtue regardless of circumstances, I believe, is the message that is very well said.
B008Y212PI|3.0|I was forced to give a review in order to have complete game. Game is good, although several advanced screens are not solvable using logic. Must use hints.
B000TETC6A|5.0|This has always been my favorite Bowie album. Life on Mars? Kooks, Queen Bitch, and Oh you pretty things are some of the best on the album, though it's all good.  It's a mellow kind of feel, for me at least.
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Peter Jackson took the basic framework of the first 114 pages of the novel and then made up his own story.  Faithfulness to J. R. R. Tolkien's work or character development does not occur whatsoever in this movie. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed. Even looking at the movie not in context with the book, it was poor. The battle scenes lasted forever and were many and led to boredom, being the same thing repeated again and again.  I have not counted but if you can find five lines from the book you will be lucky. Question is: Why would Peter Jackson and company feel compelled to only follow the basic framework of Tolkien's work and then make up action in the movie as they go along?
B00ECR7KX2|1.0|I'm a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work, however this was just painful to watch...I couldn't even watch it all and had to turn it off.  It was very odd and jarring to watch the modern day settings with Shakespeare's language...didn't work at all.  Plus I'm not sure why it was filmed in black and white?  Bad acting, bad directing, bad bad bad!  Just seemed like a vanity piece.  This is my favorite Shakespeare work and I love the Kenneth Branagh version, so I'll stick with that, because this was just beyond horrible.  If it could give it zero stars I would!
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|This has been the perfect treat for my girls this Christmas. After you cut a piece of tape on the outside of the box, a flap folds down revealing the calendar and creating a playscape to play with the pieces you build each day. Will definitely get another one next year!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I basically enjoyed the book a lot but all the art and art theft details got a little cumbersome. I got to the point where I just skipped them. Skipping them didn't take away from the book for me - the opposite!<br />I liked the originality of the plot and the characters.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Danny is back, and so are his friends, as well as some new villains. As always, I love his books, but I hate the new villains. Not in a good, &#34;You're so evil I just hate you&#34; kind of way, but a, &#34;everything else is so awesome, why do I have acknowledge these schmucks&#34; kind of a way. Still, a good story with a bunch of interesting characters and it kept me up at nights reading it. :)
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is very fun, the controls are easy, and you can unlock stuff for the console version by completing achievements.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It held my interest through the whole book.  So glad Grisham is back to his niche.  Hope a movie is made of this.
0425074811|5.0|cool book, its an old read but it was crazy fun and very cool to read. Its great to look outside the box and think differently.
B00EH6SK78|5.0|THIS is why I love metal! Honestly, it's hard to rank DevilDriver's albums as a fan. This one continues to make the job hard. Even an untrained ear can recognize the difference in songs. The tracks don't just blend into one monotonous droning album.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|The Best of the best! These musicians are phenomenal! The whole crew, really. I have been following & listening to Jon Schmidt and Steven Sharp Nelson for 15 or so years. They never disappoint. ♥
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had to keep reading to see where this story was going.  Interesting twists and turns. Can't wait to start the next book.
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Was a little disappointed in this book of the Scarpetta series.  It was particularly gorey and reminded me of something from Criminal Minds.
0446530573|5.0|lots of yummy food easy to fallow easy to do my husband loves the show so why not the food
B00FIYEZYA|5.0|Talent and creativity are plentiful throughout this album. I recommend listening to the full length songs if you are hesitant. 30 seconds does little to represent many of these tracks.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I got a new Mac and wasn't looking forward to buying new power supplys.  I keep three power supplys because I'm lazy.  Two offices and one in the bag.  Saved me cost of replacing the ones on the desks. I wouldn't keep one in my bag unless it was a backup.  Too small and may get lost when I need it.
B00DF0POXA|3.0|I never have a problem with Kanye's direction with the production. For the most part it's good and he switched up his sound. Yeezus has some stand out tracks. But a few of the songs seem more suited for 808s and I wasn't really a fan of that album either.<br /><br />Best songs:<br />Black Skinhead<br />New Slave<br />Blood on the leaves<br />I Am a God<br />Bound 2
B0053O8ARI|5.0|Love the show!!!  Have been watching it on TV for the past few months and just had to start at the beginning and learn all bout these girls.
B009GEPPYC|1.0|I wish I could get my money back on this one.  Or a credit to my bill.  Just a dog all around, and I couldn't tell if Tom Cruise was being campy or if he thought he was cool.
B00005RZV4|5.0|when Trent sets out to make a record he really does some trippy stuff this does not fail to be that
1465414444|5.0|Fantastic artwork and a great collection of lore.  I've been a fan of the authors for some time and this book did not disappoint.  Great gift idea for the Warcraft lovers in your life.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|I am a softy for the holiday classics! But, this modern day holiday movie won me over! Must be added as one of the must see holiday films!!
B004YW4L5K|1.0|Huh?  I couldn't keep track of what was going on.  Perhaps I'll pick it up another time.  The initial story started out ok, but then I got lost in the characters roles.
B001PPGAK8|3.0|I bought this movie to complete the trilogy.  It IS the weakest of the 3.  Not a bad movie for a lazy sunday, just not great like X2 or X1, but better than the wolverine movies (both).<br /><br />In my order of best to worse X2&#62;X1=1st Class&#62;X3&#62;Both wolverine movies
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|when you have a couple mins to spare it is good at killing them. although the game is addicting.......so be warned
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I read constantly, so much so, that many times i forget books I've read. A Thousand Splendid Suns and The Kite Runner stand out in my memory as excellent books that pop into my mind from time to time. This story was good but choppy and had many characters that don't seem needed or whose stories weren't developed enough.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|The raw talent of these two young, aspiring actors is so refreshing! The story captures you and holds your attention to the end!  Make sure you have a lot of Kleenex
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Does not work. You tube and kindle do not work together. Do not waste your time with this. None work
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I'm really not much on comics, but I am watching the tv series and the keep mentioning the books. I just had to give them a try. I wish I had started them earlier! Looks like the series have been staying very close to the original story, which I really like. Plus the artwork is fantastic! Now I just have to purchase more! I read just too fast! Of course I would recommend this. I'm hoping to read up to where the series is when it restarts next year.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very fun read! Could imagine the many short stories ver vividly. Quick page turner of a book. Recommend it to others that like sci fi adventure/horrors.
B00G32TD98|5.0|Well made horror film.  It had a great story line and well acted.  Very scary movie.  I highly recommend this film if you are a fan of this genre.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderful movie about people heading into retirement and needing to head to a different country to afford housing. Funny and heartbreaking, This movie is a must see.
B00H2UFHBI|5.0|Incredible characters are my favorite part of this series, with fifteen mystics who are conjured out of the pages to teach, sometimes confuse and often save the hero and his friends, there is no shortage of great characters. And they walk in a world very similar to ours except that the veil has been lifted just a bit to reveal what is really there, something that many of us perhaps have always suspected. The churning, stirring plot rarely lets you breathe, except when they meditate. I’m hoping we get to see the Inner Movement as a series of movies some day. Until then, I’m looking forward to more books by this author.
B009M2T7K6|5.0|It's perfect! Exactly like the photographs and the delivery was super fast. I'm happy with this item and hopping to give it to my niece soon!
B001ACY8D2|1.0|It is amazing. I bought this CD twice, both CDs had defects. In one, from Festival on, there is a failure periodically taking place in the sound. The second one only plays in any CD reproducer with a very strange sound. Good reason not to listen to it, even though I like the music in itself
B00129H7VS|5.0|Awesome series, my wife and I were hooked! Very interesting for anyone with interest in WWII, history or just good shows!
B001706I5I|1.0|I am too hooked on the original to appreciate this version if the Grinch,  I am a softy for classics.  Jim Carey just doesn't do it for me.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game, but energy doesnt last long and its a bit frustrating waiting for it to build back up again
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|So it great but it's hard to believe that the government has been the case for example the government has been the government has been the government has been the government has been the government has been the most common sense of our apps back in the government<br /><br />Cool stuff that the government has been the government has been the government has been bye
B003LR5BD0|5.0|This DVD is worth buying for the commentary alone. Upon selecting the commentary option from the menu the movie will begin playing in the order that each scene was shot, with Christopher Nolan explaining the technical aspects of how they accomplished each shot and scene. It's fantastically informative and provides great insight into the filmmaking process, great for filmmakers looking to expand their knowledge or for people who are just curious about how movies are made. Highly recommended.
B000X1T7MS|4.0|I have always contended that the only Orthodox Muslims that exist are the ones that try to kill Americans, Israelis, and other infidels. Unfortunately, this book confirms my position. People need to get educated. Grab this book and the Koran. Don't wait.
0399159347|5.0|I THOUGHT A LITTLE SLOW TO START BUT THEN I GOT HOOKED. ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE ENDING. LAST CHAPTER WAS THE BEST.  MAKES SENSE OF THE SAYING &#34; SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT UNSAID&#34;.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|my daughter loves this movie, it is the only thing she asked Santa for so luckily we were able to get it and will have a happy little girl on Christmas morning.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Dirty Dancing is a entertaining, all around good movie, even now-twenty six years after its first appearance on screen. It's great!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I wanted a portable, USB-powered, mic- and line-level audio interface for my Mac laptop that I can use for home recording and live performance, and this is perfect. I can run a vocal mic and a guitar through it and get exactly what I need.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|I love The Killers and knew that I would really enjoy this, but had no idea how blown away I would be. Brandon is a great songwriter and is able to explore different areas here on his solo record. Beautiful songs and lyrics throughout.
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|Classic movie. This movie has great writing, great characters, and cinematography. All the other exorcist movies are junk, view this before you look at the others.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|Works quite well with my Apple TV and XtremeMac analog sound bar [[ASIN:B0060DW03G Xtrememac USB-B22-01 USB Powered PC Speaker]]<br /><br />This converter also has a 3.5mm output audio jack, so rca cables aren't exclusively needed.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I feel that this game it a lot of fun. it is fairly simple and enjoyable to play. I would most definately recommend this game to my friends
B0094BB4TW|5.0|my favorite social app, was easy to download on my Kindle fire HD. I would recommend you get this app.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|love it so much fun. Easy to play, play it every day all daylong if I could. Try it you will get hooked
0783225733|5.0|This is another great film for anyone's collection. Apollo 13 with Tom Hanks and the other casts of stars. I love the scene where they had Buzz Aldrin talking to the other astronauts mother's in the kitchen in the film. This film really showed how tight the NASA community was back in the early days of Space and the Apollo missions and made me wish that we had a president who would bring back our Space Missions!!!!
076115728X|5.0|great story and message for kids... - especially budding perfectionists-- lots of fun things to move and touch on the pages.
B005CRQ3NY|4.0|I think it was a great book and I would love to read more books similar to this one .
B00F2LIV4E|3.0|Sadly, I hate to say, this album just isn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />I've been a HUGE Dream Theater fan for years now (since they released Train of Thought)<br /><br />Octavarium, Scenes From a Memory, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, and Images and Words are easily in my top 10 albums of all time.<br /><br />This album isn't bad, but I feel it was almost a compilation of B-sides from A Dramatic Turn of Events.<br /><br />Firstly, the songs don't have the organic flow a lot of older Dream Theater had. I realize it's a near impossible task to write music this complex without having to just nudge a little bit here and there, but very little of this album actually feels like it grows into something worth noting. There are some great riffs, and fun little progressive elements as would be expected, but it just doesn't make up for the lack of everything else that is Dream Theater.<br /><br />Secondly, production wise, it's mixed fantastically. It's solid, powerful, and raw at moments. However, my complaints are Mangini's snare drum and Labrie's vocal engineering. They both sound WAY too processed. The snare sounds like it's been sampled. There is very little dynamic (if any) and it gets rather monotonous. The vocals, while FANTASTIC on Labrie's part, sit too far above the mix for my ear. It just sounds like they were thrown on top, and they called it a day. It also sounds like they're too... digital sounding. Not in the fashion of autotune, but certainly similar.<br /><br />Overall, I feel as though this album is just plain uninspired. There aren't any tracks that really stand out to me, and I'd been hopeful that this would be the album that showed Mangini's prowess on drums. Sadly, this album just doesn't live up to A Dramatic Turn of Events, which, although not their best work, is still leagues better than this.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|As a non tech person, I found this straight forward and easy to follow. I'm now publishing my sixth book and still refer to it on occasion.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|What possibly can someone say bad about West Side Story? There is singing in it? Come on. With a young Natalie Wood and it being the Full Screen Edition it's more than one could hope for! Buy it or rent it or watch it on Netflicks or Amazon Prime. You will be glad you did. It's a great film and I wish that they made more like them these days...
B009WUBERW|4.0|If you like action/adventure films, this one is for you.  It is the sequel to the first Expendables movie with many of the original cast members returning, but the story if much different.  It is action packed and lots of fun.
B00GD9F59S|3.0|Becauase it didnt tell us anything about the battle. Or what happened to Seth and the<br />missing God. Is there another sequeal or are left hanging in the dark?<br /> This was not one of her better books and I am a huge fan of hers and<br />the Covenent Series.
0312641893|4.0|If you like Cinderella and you liked Twilight then you'll love this book. The story is different than any Cinderella I've ever encountered but once I got going, I couldn't put it down. The writing isn't...top notch, (Twilight quality) but if you can look past it then I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not into sci-fi or anything that seems to have a more gothic feel to it, so when I heard about this story I was skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was and I've already ordered the books from the rest of the series.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|I picked out this game for my 2-year old son who loves trains. It is a little too complicated for him to figure out on his own, but 4- and 5- year old daughters love it and they play it with him. It is mostly very simple, but does have some complexities that many young children may need help with - but that's okay, because it is good to play these games with your kids sometimes.
B000AP04OM|5.0|It's the sound of Music.. What can I say! It's the greatest! Julie Andrews is simply the best.. she is up there with Judy Garland..
B00F880BWG|5.0|It makes you keep coming back for more. What will they do next? Will they be able to put the group back together? Many questions to be answered.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Game sets up and is ready to play very fast. The simulation is clear and you can add your own pictures as the card backs for a more personal touch. The achievements are a interesting addition.  Great game for when you have a few minutes to wait and when you have unlimited time.
B008JFUR10|4.0|I thought the movie was ok but it really did not keep my attention going. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this movie.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I keep trying to give it a chance, but it just keeps freezing up and won't let me check anything. The mobile site seems to have improved lately, so I don't even bother any more. Maybe they have fixed the bugs, but I doubt it.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|It's not 21, but it's still a great album. It's more pristine than 21, but Adele is still Adele, no matter who you slice it. I love her and think she is the greatest!
B00B22ASUM|4.0|Honest, heartwarming story written by the man who lives it. This book will be appreciated by anyone that's ever had a special 4-legged friend.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|In my opinion this is my favorite games it's very fun and very addictive FORGET ALL THE BAD COMMETS they don't know they talking about. GET THE GAME
B008JFURKG|5.0|What  a great movie this is. When I saw Red for the first time I was so glad that they came out with Red two
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very enjoyable game.  Lots of selections of patterns. Good color.  Lots of fun and entertainment. I still play it every day.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love that Candy Crush is available for my Kindle Fire now. But it needs more updates to add more levels. I had an update for candy crush a couple days ago, I updated but still no new levels were added.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game, keeps everyone amused, not too taxing on the brain cells. perseverance is a must unless you want to pay loads to advance
B00E0P8VTS|1.0|This is review of LP, not album . LP that I received had a lot of clicks. One track had scratches. I did replace it with another one. It came even in worth condition - like old misused poor condition LP. I've returned it. Manufacturer does not have any idea how to make LPs.
B003MQNENY|5.0|One of the best novels of the twentieth century. A moving story superbly written; wonderful English. Read it slowly and maybe more than once. There is so much in this book you may miss something the first time. Of course, it is now dated in the way people think and what they believe. Very funny in parts. None of Evelyn Waugh's other novels come any way near Brideshead.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|It's a lot of fun and the colors are chrisp. I have enjoyed building the buiildings also. I would give this game a thumbs up.
B000002KDS|5.0|As always, Alice is amazing. His music gets your blood pumping! Alice Cooper's music is quite addicting and timeless. I am a lifelong fan.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was one of the worst books I've ever read, the writing is, at times, funny and I loved the inner goddess and consciousness characters but the writing  is so uneven. I find it hard to believe that things like  follicles standing on edge, the online conventions, and sheer repetition of the same adjectives and adverbs over  and over managed to get passed a decent editor. I didn't get why the author would use vernacular with the characters and then suddenly throw in some archaic or obscure word. It felt as if she was trying to get the SAT vocabulary list in there. The parallels to Twilight we're fun to pick out-and there were so many that Stephanie Meyer could probably claim copyright infringement. I sure hope the screen play is better, but all in all, I wish I'd just re-read Twilight.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good game, not too easy, not too hard. No irritating musuc or sound effects.  I like that it doesnt constantly ask for money, if it got rid of the flashing ads, I would rate it 5 stars.
1451629192|5.0|This book is about a brave girl who had to fight for survival from a beast...Well written and god bless Jaycee
B00501LD5U|5.0|This movie is so different and awesome, our whole family loves it. Don't be a wet sandwich, buy this movie.
B003V1WUKS|1.0|I think my 9 year old writes better than this. James Franco is an embarrassment to the Palo Alto school system.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really love this game.  Really loved playing the original on Facebook. I think I love this one more!  Will be playing this game for a long time
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Are you a people-watcher?  I am.  I love sitting on a bench on the boardwalk, watching the people go by and imagining their lives.  In HUMANS OF NEW YORK, photographer Brandon Stanton took people watching to the next level.  In 2010 he set out to &#34;singlehandedly create a photographic census of New York City.&#34;  First came his very successful blog humansofnewyork.com; then came this book of some of the best photographs of people that I have ever seen captioned with just enough of a blurb to send your imagination into overdrive.<br /><br />Prior to becoming a full-time photographer, Brandon Stanton was a bond trader in Chicago.  When the bottom fell out of that job, he turned to his love of photography and his blog was born.  Traveling from Chicago to New York, Stanton made stops in between to photograph the faces and places of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia; but it wasn't until he made it to New York City that he found his calling.  Humans.  Amazingly these New Yorkers stopped whatever they were doing to spend a few moments with the photographer to pose for a photo and tell him a little bit about themselves.  The result is this book version of people watching.<br /><br />What a brilliant idea.  This is a book that I'll keep.  I won't be giving it away.  I read the book cover to cover soaking in all of the photos and the captions.  Yet, each time I open it, I see something new.  This book is the perfect gift to give to that hard to buy for person in your life.<br /><br />Here's hoping that this photographer keeps snapping photos and sharing them with all of us.<br /><br />✰✰✰✰✰
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I love this movie.  It is a real romantic film.  Played a few times.  Love how the story ends.  Enjoy!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Wonderful storyline, great characters! Will recommend to all of my friends.......... Once I started I could<br />not stop watching. Could definately watch again!
B003G8WI7G|4.0|Just plain fun.  I like it more each time I listen. More great music from the Big Easy.  I'd love to see Shorty live.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Easy to play and great for passing the time :) thanks for making this game! Just maybe more ways to earn characters?
B0090P98Z4|5.0|This is thee best game I've ever played on a tablet. I'm in love with it. The graphics are sexy and the game style is breathtaking.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|Only have half of it read.  Has not really held my complete interest as most of her books do.  Much more technical than mystery.
B000JLTRIQ|5.0|one of my favorite movies to watch with my kids. they asj questions and i am comforable with them watching history
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really enjoying this app. I started playing and before I knew it it was bed time. Time flies when you are having fun!
B005KJZDXK|3.0|It's not as bad as the people writing 1 star reviews, but I'd also say that it's not as good as the people writing 5 star reviews say as well. Only 1 or 2 of the songs have a real upbeat feel. But zooey deschanel's voice is pretty nice to listen to. Id say this album is perfect for relaxed background music. If you are looking for something to really get you into the festive christmas spirit though... I'd say this is not the right CD.<br />Other than that the music seems to be put together well and the voices are very smooth and easy to listen to. Curl up, bake cookies, decorate the tree, or snuggle in the blankets with hot chocolate is what I see/feel  when I'm hearing this album.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This game is so realistic!!  Third Wire productions needs to add more...maybe two wing men or command a squad.  They should also add an urban environment crawling with enemy troops and tons of anti-aircraft guns.  Five more things which they need to add are: a new and improved AI, actual missions, better cockpit view with a HUD, more planes, more environment.  Otherwise, excellent game!!!
1612680011|5.0|This book, coupled with The 4-Hour Work Week (4HWW) by Timothy Ferriss completely changed my life.<br /><br />Kiyosaki is a bit redundant and long winded, this book could probably be 100 pages, but he does a good job taking you on a journey.<br /><br />Most people need the long established pre-conceived notions, like a house is your biggest asset and get a good job at a stable company, to be attacked and torn down.<br /><br />Kiyosaki re-trains you in as gentle a way as possible.<br /><br />I purchased this book again to give away to friends and family to see them become successful as well.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book helps you format your book properly for Kindle, which is needed for readability once it is uploaded for viewing.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I personally have to say that this game is awesome. It may be awesome but there is alot of hard levels.
0694003611|5.0|My baby's favorite bedtime story! This is a really good book to read to very young infants. The sentences are short and sweet. Some of the pages are not crowded so young babies get to focus on what's on that page. My baby loves the page with just the small mouse, he will often use his hand to touch the mouse!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Actually, I'm her son who is rating this app. T H I S IS THE MOST AWESOME GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE L.I.F.E!!!!!!<br /> The updates for the game is pretty interesting. I suggest you by the game. It's REALLY good.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Cute movie.........:0)  Not for everyone, but I like the dry humor and the stars............Have watched it several times now, and still laugh.......lol
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg she is an awesome writer I can't believe how into this series I am it's kind of ridiculous lol
B007WFR0QS|5.0|This is one of the best artists I've heard in quite some time.  Very soulful and in tune with what music truly is.
B00BAXFACO|1.0|Connelly has gone to the well too many times.  The whole book seems sloppy.  Do attorneys really ask to \\"make a motion\\"?  There is too much really awkward dialogue and some of the plot lines seem very contrived.  (The sudden relationship with the ex-prostitute just doesn't seem real.). I just could not get interested.
B00BBQXUYK|5.0|This is a great movie that both kids and parents would love.  Very creative.  We will have this on our Christmas movie list for years.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|EACH TIME I SEARCHED FOR A BOOK - this book kept - spiritually grabbing me and pulling .e ever so gently. I am now glad that I read/listened to this story. Tears, anger, excitement - WOW. A good story!
B001EA4M7M|4.0|loved it,,have really been getting into the classics and i love the British ones...love Downton Abbey too...i am living in the wrong century
B00BAXFECK|1.0|From reading the first few pages, I thought it would be interesting. I read 15 % of the book.  It was very depressing.  If it got better later, I don't know.
B00EHMG358|5.0|Linc and Doug never dissapoint. This latest Agent Pendergast book will keep you intrigued until the very end. Bravo!<br />Enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great Book. Can't put it down. When I do, my husband can't me off of him;) Very sexy book with just enough romance to spice up your love life!!!
B006885FZI|5.0|Incredible....Better than Band Of Brothers (Which I absolutely Loved)  The Pacific Arena makes Europe look like Disneyland ...I never knew the fighting was as savage and the conditions were so horrific. Hanks and Spielberg nail it again ! THe actors that played &#34;Sledge&#34; and &#34; Snafu&#34; were absolutely amazing. Keep in mind every one of the characters are real people and these are the real things that happened to them. I just can not even imagine having to go through something like that at 18,19,20 years old. In my opinion our men now that age would not of been able to handle the brutality of the fighting then. The men that age were different back then....more mature and far more patriotic than the current generation. And the million dollar question.......What would the world be like had the Allies not stopped Hitler and the Empire of Japan then?????? WAYYYYY DIFFERENT !
B007FH9GT2|4.0|A very good story. It was a real page turner. I read all of the triolgy and wished for more.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|can play all day if u want or just when you want casually.  could be a little easier to navigate thru but not to difficult
B00B9PJ13M|5.0|These fit my foot the same as other timberlands (which is that they run large) so I ordered a half size smaller than I wear in any other brand of shoe. Looks wise, they are beautiful and have gotten several compliments on them already!
B007B17XW4|5.0|What is not too love about LEGO?  Very entertaining for my son and he spent hours putting it together!  Love it!
B007OV6AT8|1.0|I thought the book was poorly written. I gave up reading it after the first two chapters. I felt it a waste of time.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|it was a very interesting first person read. to experience what a person would feel and do when finding your self in a new body and life. I look forward to the next book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Another great Hunger Games book with an unpredictable ending.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I didn't love it as much as the other two.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|This was everything my daughter wanted. Very fast delivery. Is a original cd. I only go crazy when is JB's Day because my daughter loves to play all day long.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I think the book was set in a frame work very similar to  &#34;a time to kill &#34; and because I knew what was going to happen, it distracted from the ending. This book was more boring than other books.
B00BATG18K|1.0|I was so very disappointed by this latest effort by one of my favorite authors, Amy Tan.  This book was just not up to her standards.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Yeah, this is a total chic flick, but still quite enjoyable. I downloaded the 48 hour rental to watch on a flight, and it kept me entertained. Sure, it is a little predictable, but the characters are very likeable. It won't win any Academy Awards, but it was for a plane ride.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a while, I couldn't put it down! It was written from such a unique perspective and the author made you feel almost like you were there. I loved this book and even though I typically don't read a book more than once this is one I plan to read again!
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Not like the others this seemed to be more along the lines of a day in the life of Iron Man instead of an actual plot from start to finish . The ending was not very well done either and your left thinking is that it?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game just wish you could play for longer time and not wait for 30 mins. To play again. Don't like paying 99cents to continue to play.game it's self great
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Twyla is so pretty! The colors used in the hair and plastic are some of my favorites, so I had to buy it for my 10 yr old daughter. She just watched the 13 Wishes movie, and is obsessed with it. So I know she will love this doll for Xmas!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|like the challenges. makes you think to figure out what the problem is and find the solutions. like the game!
B000SEKNUK|5.0|This is an amazing book! So well written and using examples from everyday life that not only make sense but clear the way for us to look inward and see our self. take the time to read this one, you will be happy you did.
B00FVZJYK6|4.0|I liked the human feelings in the story but the secret service part of the story was not clear to me what was going on there somewhat violent.......
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|anyone who has had personal experience with an alcoholic will relate to this movie in a negative way. It raises your emotions which is a good thing to do, some of which you may not want to rekindle. I gave it 4 stars because it was well acted and  presents the world thru the eyes of the main character as opposed to the rest of the world
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I enjoyed the first two books in the series, but this one was totally different. It was quite slow in the story line and each chapter switched back and forth between Tobias and Tris. Some of the chapters were only a couple pages, so I had to constantly remember which perspective I was reading from. It was frustrating and the story line ended up being disappointing.
0547848412|5.0|I RECIEVED THIS BOOK VERY QUICKLY. AND I ENJOYED READ IT WITH WATCHING THIS MOVIE WHEN I CONFUSED.<br />THANK YOU.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Love this.  Good selection of old and new.  He does a nice job singing all the classics and the new ones rock!
B009EBLCK8|5.0|Great show, only downside is that there are only 3 episodes that are 90 minutes in duration per season / series.  This second run is even better than the first, with a great ending.
0060920084|5.0|As someone who has done a lot of traveling across the USA, this was very entertaining and eye-opening. Highly recommended!
0439023491|5.0|Great book. Perfect condition. Great book. Good story not only for kids but adults as well. Good for girls and boys.
B0037A4ILC|5.0|An extremely chilling movie. One thing I did not understand is why did the rescue team not have a longer rope? They knew Toni is stuck somewhere very high up. If only they had not tied two ropes with a knot, probably Toni Kurz would have been alive today to tell the account of their climb from horse's mouth!<br /><br />Nevertheless, the movie is made in a very realistic fashion, and I had chills while watching it (more chills than what I get when watching fake horror movies)!
B00FLML7HW|5.0|X-Men and the Wolverine Collection is a great price for all six movies in a Blu-ray format.  The box set collection comes with awesome cover art on each disk.

B00BAXFECK|3.0|This book starts out really good.  Afraid I felt all the drugs, etc made it a no go for me.  Well written and I did have to finish it for I did like the character.  The author did a good job on him.  So, I did not feel it was a book I felt like telling others to read.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Classic movie. Great condition. Don't see movies like this anymore. I was so thrilled to get it on dvd finally!
B0081SRJSY|5.0|While this app is only the basic and rivers portions, the gameplay is swift and smooth. I'm hoping some other expansions are added on later!
B00A6RCSKC|4.0|I've never been a tower defense fan but this game and its sequel have me hooked.  Really helps pass the time when I get a break from the daily grind.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is one of the best Blu-ray releases ever! Life of Pi was shot with the Arri Alexa Digital Cameras, so the film is breathtakingly life like. The 2D Grainless MPEG-4 AVC transfer is just stunning. The opening scenes at the family's zoo will just blow you away! It really demonstrates the true potential and promise of the Blu-ray format.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-ray is as near to perfection as I have seen too. There are things that don't catch your eye or attention until you see it in 3D. The 3D effects are very believable. There are just enough in-front-of-the-screen 3D moments to make the experience exciting.<br /><br />The story is quite engrossing, and it keeps you thinking. This is the type of movie that as a story and spectacle is beautiful to behold. Even on subsequent viewings, the film maintains its charm, and I have enjoyed seeing it in both 2D and 3D.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Classic! perfect condition. Can't go wrong with a throwback. Was happy to get it on DVD and not just VHS.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Works fine!  I had a bit of difficulty installing and using it at first, but it's the first app I've ever installed - I'm just getting started with the Android system and my new Galaxy camera.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This show is fantastic!  I was hooked on it after the first episode!  I was so glad to go back and see all episodes from the beginning.
0804161380|5.0|Beautiful box set. Definitely worth the money if you're a big Zelda geek like me. Really happy that the box isn't crappy. That was my only concern to be honest.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Continues to be intriguing and compelling. The characters and plot twists are never ending. Love to see the characters evolve.
B00E9PMMX0|4.0|I'm reviewing this from the standpoint of never having owned these on blu ray.<br /><br />I have as much hate for the majority of the changes made to the classic trilogy as any other fan does but I bought this with the mindset that the bad stuff only takes up a few minutes per film and the worst of the bunch, Ep4's Jabba scene and Jedi's musical number can be skipped. The universally hated &#34;Greedo shoots first&#34; scene has been much improved with both of the blaster shots happening at almost the exact same time. For now, this is as close as we're going to get to the original on blu-ray.<br /><br />The picture quality is outstanding with textures in clothing, details in some of the models and matte paintings really popping out for the first time. One thing that's a bit odd though is the pink aura/tint that many of the explosions have especially when the stormtroopers are boarding the rebels in the beginning of Ep4. Not a real atrocity but just seems a bit too harsh.<br /><br />It would have been cool to have a few docs on these but I guess they're just going to keep those with the complete saga set. The commentary tracks included in this set are pretty cool since they include Alec Guinness and Ralph McQuarrie as well as others that you rarely ever hear from on a commentary track.<br /><br />The set certainly isn't perfect but getting to see the trilogy in unmatched clarity is well worth it if you never bought the complete saga set.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|I don't give 5 stars to many albums. But 'Machine Gun' alone would qualify this album for 5 stars. If you like Hendix, you need to have this in your collection.
B001EBWITA|5.0|My wife and I love this movie and always wished there was a squeal.  Glad i have the DVD for my collection
B00BC254I8|1.0|I feel like this book is one long rant (and he is not guilty), he had a bad childhood (and he is not guily), he didnt learn how to express himself (and he is not guily) etc. etc. etc.  For someone who claims he is well read, and has read all the great books, he writes horrible.  He keeps circling back and honestly I am very sorry I bought this book.  Save your time and money.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|This is such a family friendly fun spin off of the Wizard of Oz.  Not trying to simply be new faces with an old plot, this movie incorporates a cute love story as the viewer is taken through the emerald city.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very intriguing story which I found hard to put down,  Very engaging.  I only wish the ending were better.  The reader is left to imagine the &#34;what next&#34;.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It will have you glued to your chair with every word, promising suspense, impressive plots, anger, desire, and sorrow. Very good trilogy. i'm glad i read it when all the books were in the market, because i couldn't stand the need for more, for finding out how everything will turn out.<br /><br />Very pleased with the end, unexpected and happy. I recommend it , is not a hard reading since seems to be designed for a younger audience.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|There's not much to play on PS4 yet so I decided to buy this as my first PSN movie. It's hokey and predictable in almost every way, there are 0 surprises and it's such a deliberately simplistic story. There are no stand out performances, no great dialogue and even the action sequences are fairly bland. The basic simplified moral of the story is finding a sense of humanity amidst eugenicist, elitist attitudes that do pervade humankind's reality at the moment so there is relevance to the movie's message but it's not delivered in an epic way at all.
1579128149|5.0|The photos were absolutely beautiful. The pages are as thick as they come and the overall condition and explanation of each element is exquisite. Would recommend for any Chemistry geek.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|Delivery date according to estimate, which it is a key factor for peace of mind during Holiday season and rush time period
B00ECUARO8|2.0|This is sooooooo slow to the point we stopped watching.  Just looked like a C rated movie.  I am even from the area it was filmed in and still could not get into the movie.
0525478817|5.0|I'm an avid reader, and just when I thought I had read all of the good young adult books out there, I stumbled upon John Green. I bought Looking For Alaska and Paper Towns along with tfios, but I read the other two first due to a strong pull I felt to this story. I felt as if I needed to rush through the other books and save this one for last, and boy am I glad I did. In the short three hours it took me to read this masterpiece, I was on an emotional roller coaster the whole time. There's mascara staining the pages from the middle of my copy to the end. It's been over a year now and I can't even read a quote without tearing up. Anytime I go to put the book back on my shelf, I can't. I've never felt more attached to a story in all of my years of reading, and no plot line has ever affected or moved me this much. Thank you, John Green, for leaving a mark on me.
B00D48BSBA|5.0|The Kill List<br /><br />Good research. Author seemed to be well informed about  actual situation, well worked into a fictional story full of suspense.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|The story was enchanting and Margaret O'Brian was exceptional.  I have watched this movie two or three times and still find it wonderful.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|Great game,  nice interface, no glitches. Lots of fun, I really enjoy playing it in my lunch breaks. Well done!
B007MC8YLQ|4.0|Fun to play. Slight problems with moving the cards the way I want to.  Good way to kill time on your phone.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|All together a good quality game the combat system is simple and doesn't lag the graphics are great for a mobile game all together an impressive and well made game worth the download
B008602KQI|5.0|Goes to show that they can make a hit movie while staying true to the book.  Story set in the future when America no longer exsists, what is left is a placed called Panem. The Capital runs Panem surrounded by 13 districts full of slaves. 74 years ago the districts rebelled againist the Capital and lost with district 13 destroyed. As punishment, the Capital made the Hunger Games. The districts had to send 1 male and 1 female between the ages of 12 and 17 to fight to the death on tv. The lone surviver wins a lifetime of money and food.  Now it's time for the 74th Hunger Games and we meet 16 year old Katniss Everdeen living in district 12. When her 12 year old sister, Prim's name is picked, Katniss volunteers to take her place and regards it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before so survival for her is in her nature.
0385351399|5.0|Dave Eggers never disappoints me. I read all his books, as soon as they are published. Remarkable man, remarkable writer. This novel will change you. It entertains while making you think. It would be incredibly naive to think many of us are over-whelmed and over-connected. Share. Share. Share. We are mired in the much of minutia and Eggers takes this reality and exposes it. Great book. Read it. Buy it for anyone on your holiday gift list. The perfect present. Real paper, don't buy the digital edition -- seriously don't -- buy the paper ...

B003UESJ9W|5.0|One of the surprisingly best movies I have ever seen.  The chemistry between Chiles and Beau sent chills down my spine. I already owned the movie on Dvd but bought a blue-ray player and wanted this new favorite in high definition.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Doing the experiments is not only fun but it also trains your mind to be expecting great things from the Universe.  By the way, the Universe never fails to deliver.
B0087FMUCQ|4.0|This is a quick time waster.  It is good if you like flicking games.  I knocked off one star for the frustration factor.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|Sucks Booty and it smells funny. I do not even know how they sell this stuff. Maybe the motivation is to get the stink out of thier building...
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Definitely funny kids movie that parents can sit down and enjoy with the children as much if not maybe even more than the children (I know for one my wife and I were dying of laughter).<br /><br />Don't want to give away any details of the movie, but it was most definitely a pleasant surprise.  Much better than I had originally imagined.<br /><br />Definitely worth watching at least once, hence why I rented it in HD on Amazon Instant Video which streams so much better to my house than Netflix.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It doesn't let me in o; .... Amazon just made it worst.. xc .... Ugh , I hope they make this app better ^~^

B00GH4RKYM|5.0|This was a great movie, could have done so much more with the story line though. Graphics were amazing!  Had issues streaming it a little and OUT OF THE BLUE!  Amazon sends me an email saying we don't normally refund streaming instant purchases but noticed you had streaming difficulties so here is a refund of your instant video streaming purchase!!! Well Shut the Front Door!!! What unbelievable service! Was already in my checking account!  Thanks Amazon.com!! I have just finished my first year of Amazon Prime and wow it has been worth it!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is my favorite. Whenever I need to distract myself from the days woes,  I go to Candy Crush Saga.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|The basic premise here is that Ian Fleming is his own inspiration for James Bond and this novel is a fictionalized portrayal of Fleming's war service.<br /><br />For the first five chapters it's ok ..... And then it just becomes absolutely ridiculous as the anachronisms pile up. The plot centers around the desire of the British to neutralize the French fleet after the fall of France in 1940. Commander Fleming is parachuted into Vichy France with two million quid in gold sovereigns to bribe Admiral Darlan.<br /><br />A bit far- fetched but, what the heck?<br /><br />However, things start to become ridiculous almost immediately. The plane is caught in a storm, Fleming is dropped 50 miles away from his radio operator and the canister containing the gold in the Pyrennees and runs across the mountain range just in time to prevent his radio operator from being killed by the Germans. For no good reason, these are commanded by Field Marshal Von Bock, who bimbles around in a giant Zeppelin. He is unhelpfully assisted by an SS captain who seems to be in charge of a squad of Luftwaffe paratroopers and, if you still care, some chaps in a fleet of attack helicopters.<br /><br />Von Bock has a Russian personal assistant who wears a latex uniforms, Fleming's radio operator is a Private First Class (a rank that doesn't exist in the British Army) seconded from GCHQ ( an organization that wasn't formed until long after WWII) and there's a miniaturized radio- location beacon in the gold canister.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't finish the book! However, I wouldn't be surprised if, by the end, Fleming hadn't been rescued by a bunch of aliens in a Trident submarine .... with lasers!<br /><br />In short, this book is utterly awful. Not only is it not worth the ninety-nine cents I invested in it but, I regret the waste of three hours of my life.<br /><br />Be warned\\"
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Fb app for this doesn't work really well as it does on my tablet. I have a blast playing this game!
B004UID2LC|5.0|So easy to go to YouTube in one click of the button. I look up how to crochet and they explain the process so well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for all ages!  Highly recommended! Highly addictive! Can't get enough! Wish the would bring back the Hey coins in game boards though.
B00A6UHC0U|1.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />'Pacific Rim', noted director Guillermo Del Toro's attempt to update the old Japanese Godzilla monster genre, can best be described as a colossal waste of money. The setting is a decade from now. The monsters, called Kaiijus, have escaped from an inter-dimensional rift on the ocean floor and wreak havoc all over earth. In response, mankind have developed Jaegers, giant humanoid contraptions, piloted by two humans, who work in tandem via a mind meld of sorts. We're introduced to Raleigh Becket, a former Jaeger pilot who lost his brother while they were battling one of the Kaiijus a few years before. Becket is called out of retirement as the commander of the Jaegers, Stacker Pentecost, believes he's the best for the job.<br /><br />Right off the bat, the plot makes little sense. The Jaeger program is discontinued as the giant machines are no match for the overpowering Kaiijus. Instead, the powers that be decide to construct giant walls to protect earth's population from the monsters. The only problem is that the walls are completely flimsy and collapse after the first Kaiiju attack. Why then did they believe the walls would work at all?<br /><br />Despite the order to discontinue the Jaeger program, Pentecost seeks to throw one last 'Hail Mary' by dropping a thermonuclear bomb into the rift, cutting off the Kaiiju's portal to earth. Instead of simply showing one big monster battle after another, most of Act II involves finding a new partner for Becket. He ends up with Mako Mori, a Japanese director of a Jaeger refurbishment project, who also happens to be Pentecost's adoptive daughter. Mori wants to team up with Becket, but her over protective parent, Pentecost, is against it.<br /><br />Mori almost blows her chance when memories of a Kaiiju killing her parents interferes with the mind meld with Becket, causing the Jaeger they're testing, to go berserk. If this isn't enough, there's also a sub-plot concerning two scientists, one of whom, Geiszler, establishes a mental link with the Kaiiju brain. He goes to Hong Kong where he meets up with Chau, played by an over the top Ron Perlman, who is a black market dealer in Kaiiju body parts. Keiszler figures out that the good guys can only gain access to the portal if the Kaiiju recognize their own DNA.<br /><br />No need to rehash the rest of the plot. It's pretty obvious that the good guys manage to drop the bomb into the portal and cut off the Kaiiju access. Of course there's a whole bunch of boring Monster-Humanoid battle scenes before that, probably most enjoyed by aficionados of violent video games.<br /><br />Pacific Rim didn't do that well at the box office here in the US but cleaned up overseas. Casting pretty Japanese Rinko Kakuchi as the co-star was a brilliant casting move, which undoubtedly had a lot to do with the film's success in the Asian market.<br /><br />In the end, Pacific Rim is a pointless attempt to update the Godzilla genre. The action sequences are repetitious and the human drama is stilted and predictable. The only thing I enjoyed in the entire film is when Ron Perlman cuts himself out of the baby Kaiiju, during the post-credit sequence. That at least WAS amusing!entists, one of whom, Geiszler, establishes a mental link with the Kaiiju brain.

B00GLX1MG6|1.0|Horrible.....maybe worse than &#34;This is the End&#34;. Hard to believe but true. How do movies like this get made?! Even more disappointing and/or unbelievable is that they were somehow able to make Jennifer Aniston look bad from an appearance standpoint.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Awful story that you can't stop watching.  At the end my sinuses start acting up an causing my eyes to water, I've seen it several times and it happens every time, I'm not a chick just a guy who's wife makes him watch sappy movies.
B00D3PYQT0|5.0|Love the show and enjoyed the bonus and special features that came with the set.  Can't wait for the next season
B00BAXFAJC|2.0|Usually finding the Booker Prize winner very interesting reading. This was very disappointing. The omnipresent writer who speaks directly to the reader was distracting and stilted. Hanging in there for half the book, the plot didn't capture my attention. Sorry. Not on my must read list. I will order the sample next time.
B0081SRJSY|5.0|This is a fun game and I got it free! What a great deal! I love this game as a board game and now I can take it on the road with me. I can play with others or the computer. I love it!!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|very cute game i enjoy playing it very much can be addicting lol. i would recommend this to anyone. i like this game because you can actually get stuff done without having to wait forever lol
B00760BPOC|5.0|you are immersed into the story and the characters are so vividly portrayed you feel you are &#34;in&#34; the story,
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|I marked this book two stars, because though I found this book well researched it was misleading in many of it's concepts.  I find it very uncomfortable being taken out of my comfort zone of what I believe.  I was lead to believe this was a Catholic book following Catholic beliefs, but it is far from that.<br />The book was well researched, but that can not be the only reason to allow a person to make accusations outside of the research and that is what I feel happened here. For some I'm sure this will be a very interesting and informative read, sorry just not for me.
0307352153|4.0|I am rated a &#34;strong introvert&#34; (and an HSP--I am also a fan of Elaine Aron's work) and I was waiting to get to the part where the author discusses how to cope in &#34;a world that won't stop talking.&#34; Alas, not enough on that, in my opinion. However, I am grateful that Susan Cain wrote her book to bring awareness to the subject--her research was helpful and her personal experiences were a welcome validation. I found myself wanting more validation, however. I think that stems from being an introvert who has been pressured (and guilt-tripped) into being more extroverted. I hope Ms. Cain writes an additional book that gets more specific and in-depth on how the introvert can cope with the anxiety, obligation, guilt and feeling the need to change the essence of our very beings in order to function in a world that values and rewards extroverts. The message was clear: introverts are out there and we need to value them more. Tips on how we can help that along would be great. Ms. Cain, if you are reading this, find a nice, quiet room, have a cup of tea, and write more about us. I know you have more to say. Keep the momentum going! :-) Thank you.
B002RI9X8S|5.0|'The Grapes Of Wrath' is the most important American social book of all time.<br />This review will be short because it is a must read and anyone with any interest in social injustice to the masses - especially as it relates to a 'civilised' society - must simply buy a copy and absorb its detail. Although written in the American idiom, it is an attractive, interesting and totally compelling read.<br />The story starts in the great drought in the American Mid West of the 1930s, with the resultant mass migration towards the land of plenty, California. Although the male side of the Joad family initiate the tale, it changes subtly at first and with greater drive to prove the indomitable spirit of the female of the species. This becomes ever more apparent as the story draws to a conclusion, right down to the shocking but inevitable scene on the last page.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Be warned, though, you will pick it up and read it again every couple of years. It is irresistible.<br /><br />By the way, for those who don't already know, the book title is taken from Julia Ward Howe's 'Battle Hymn of the Republic':<br />Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;<br />He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing. That simple. Very well written book that connects you to the lives of the characters and constantly wanting to know more. Nothing to dislike except the fact that the books eventually came to an end.
B007JWC8ZC|2.0|Super fast shipping - it actually got here quicker than I thought it would. However, the top left corner of the bluray case is crushed and part of the clear plastic case that holds the disc is cracked and broken. The bluray is &#34;new&#34; so this was a big disappointment. Points for shipping, but you lose by the quality in which it arrived. 2 stars out of 5.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This is a great addition to the Eminem collection.  He's back on top,  not that he ever left.  It's worth getting the delux addition for the extra tracks.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Fascinating and uncategorizable, this kept me reading into the night! I don't know what audience it was written for, but it trapped me in.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Beautiful stuff. This score is absolutely amazing and it's a great price for so many songs. Great work composer! Turkey!
B002UOMGVU|5.0|One of the absolute best films of the 90's and arguably, along side The Godfather, the best Mob/Gangster movie ever filmed. The Special Edition Bluray Book is really impressive and a must-have for collectors. Package arrive in pristine condition and the shipping was super fast. VERY HAPPY!
B005HJWWW8|2.0|Looks like I may have gotten a counterfeit unit.<br />There is loud static when powering on the device or when switching EQ modes and only the only EQ mode that will output any sound is the 4th one - blue/red.<br /><br />Trying to contact FIIO now to find out if this device is defective or counterfeit.
B005V4FJC4|1.0|this is so boring it will not require a 2nd listen. Found it at the library and even for free it did not warrant more than one play thru. You really must be a fan to like this. A mega fan to actually buy it.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|I really enjoyed this film.  Not the subject matter I would normally choose, but this movie kept my attention throughout.  Loved it.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Absolutely the BEST show on TV/Cable right now IMHO and growing with every episode. If you have read the Comic or Graphic Novels you might recognize the players but this show goes off on its own story arcs (and thats a good thing, really) you WILL feel connected to these characters.  Word of advice, try not to get to connected,  NO ONE is safe in the Zombie Apocalypse!!
B00D9RQO56|5.0|I love this film, but it is so hard to find it at a decent price! It's weird because this move came out so long ago, but they keep putting out new editions, releases and anniversary editions that keep the price high. I didn't want a used film, and the best price I could find was on amazon, so that is why I bought the movie here. If you are looking for a better deal, you could try but I didn't find one.
B0063GORYU|4.0|My &#34;go to&#34; game when I have a few miutes to spare.  Like this version much better than the traditional game.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good book with a lot of leagaeese enjoyable read.  Easy reading good charactor deveopment God but not too suspenseful. Enjoyed it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read...interesting plot and a return to some old characters. The small town attorney with the unusual client filled with twists and turns.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Recycling elements from old Trek is fine with me (I thought ST:Enterprise finally took off when, at the end, it started doing that), if it's well done, and I thought it generally was.  So, for me, a good ST genre movie and fun.  If you disagree, or just hate Mr. Cumberbatch, not so much.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Got this for my daughter.  Really a very sweet story line.  Just reading the movie description made me want to cry.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|5 STAR Review for Tangled<br />Ok – I heard so many great things about this book prior to reading.  I think that is one of the reasons it sat on my Kindle for so long; I guess I feared it would not live up to the hype. Well, I was wrong, Tangled is amazing!! After just a few pages, Ms. Chase had me kicking myself for having waited so long to read Drew Evans.<br /><br />Ah, Drew Evans, one of New York’s elite, an investment banker from a family of wealth and privilege, a guys guy who never wanted for anything and never wanting anyone in his life.<br /><br />This book grabbed my attention from page 1. Drew wow, I have always felt male POV was one of the toughest things to nail; hats off Ms. Chase because you rocked it. This is so much more than just a male POV, this is Drew speaking directly to the reader, in a way that will have you feeling like his friend and almost wishing you were having this conversation with him over dinner.<br /><br />Drew is snarky; lovable; hysterical and in the end his characters so well done, he feels real!<br />This book is not just about dialogue, though I do love the dialogue; it truly allowed the reader into Drew’s head, as he talks directly to the reader and sometimes to himself.  It will hold your attention and have you counting the seconds until you can return the him.<br />This is truly the kind of book that makes you wish you could lay in bed with your kindle all day and shut off the world!<br /><br />Katherine Brooks walks into Drew’s life.  In what starts out as just want and lust, it turns into so much more when he finds out she is the newest employee at the investment bank his father is a partner in; this relationship truly transcends the physical.  I adored watching Drew and Kate’s professional relationship, the competitive spirit that developed into mutual respect became the foundation for a relationship that you will be rooting for!<br /><br />The use of Drew’s niece Mackenzie and what becomes likely for many an eye opening look at Disney Princesses had me loving Drew even more!<br /><br />And in the end, it was a masterful use of dialogue and characters to show Drew’s respect for Kate and professional women in general.<br /><br />We have all read girl meets playboy, girl thinks she can fix playboy and make him fall helplessly in love with her. This book transcends that maybe because this book is Drew’s voice and it starts with him telling the reader about his flu. You truly do feel like Drew gets it, that he understands the power of love and the depth to which it can touch your soul.<br /><br />In the end Drew’s actions to show Kate he is truly serious were so well done, they were not just romantic – they spoke to his desire to want Kate as his equal and to show his respect for her career.<br /><br />Hats off to Ms. Chase for an amazing story!!!  If you have not read Tangled, I highly recommend you stop, click and read this book that is now one of my favorites of the year.eye opening look at Disney Princesses had me loving Drew even more!<br /><br />And in the end, it was a masterful use of dialogue and characters to show Drew’s respect for Kate and professional women in general.<br /><br />We have all read girl meets playboy, girl thinks she can fix playboy and make him fall helplessly in love with her.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I really enjoy this show because it gives some insight into a time and place totally unfamiliar to me.  I'm from the USA and love learning about Great Britain and what their history was like.  Of course, it's a drama so I'm sure there is some exaggeration, but the characters are real and enjoyable.
B007BFSYMS|1.0|I wanted this to help me sleep better, but realized (of course) that if the Kindle was open so that it could run, then the screen light was shining, which then kept me awake.  Just not useful for my purpose.
B002DOSBMK|4.0|I have had this book in hardback for a number of years and not sure why I never found time to read it. Terrific story, realistic characters and a grand adventure await you! R.A. Salvatore paints an amazing world of the drow, rich in history and beautifully described. Can't wait to read more.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Masterful story telling.<br />Grisham at his best.<br />A very satisfying ending that should please most readers<br />With such strong characters, it would make a great movie
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It's an easy on the brain game,although it is very intriguing requiring a bit of patience to win the various sections.<br />With all games, there is the frustration when you cannot quite get things right,but this game instead of sending you into  tears,makes me laugh the more frustrated l become.  I thoroughly recommend this to anyone wanting a game that they can pick up or put down,whenever they have time to kill!
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Can play while off of face book ,it works good for me ,does not freeze up on me .<br />Good art work also .
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Coming down from the Helen trilogy, this one featuring Corrie Swanson, was not quite as intriguing, but is nonetheless the usual great work of Preston and Child.  There are hints of future stories with Pendergast's newly-found children, which I am already ready to read.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham. Can't put it down. I haven't read a book by him in several years. Glad to be connected again
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|Very good, and while obviously it had a message, didn't have to distort any facts or make any logic leaps that seemed silly
B003B02O0A|5.0|If you like books about lawyers you will like this book.<br /><br />There is a lawyer in almost every chapter of the book, sometimes two or three! You also get the occasional law student or judge.<br /><br />Occasionally there will be a chapter without a lawyer, don't freak out, the next chapter will be full of all the lawyers you can handle.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lawyers<br />Judges<br />Law students<br />District attorneys<br /><br />Cons:<br />Chapters without lawyers
B00GH4R95C|2.0|The story of Superman was told in bits and pieces and didn't go a very good job as a whole.  Also, the fight scenes were completely gratuitous and uninspired and uninteresting.
0811821846|5.0|Another great cookbook for your Star Wars fans and their families. Tasty recipes are fun and this cookbook is a keeper.  Years from now, it will still be a family favorite and collectible too. Great photos, good food.
B00821OX98|3.0|Average acting.  Average writing.  Average production quality.  It seems like an OK series to follow if there is nothing else on.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great read. Similar fast moving events, just as Time To Kill did.<br />Grisham uses the same characters, three years later.<br />A recommended perfect gift for the holidays.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|awesome game to kill time!! I'm completely addicted to this. I like the way the game changes on every level. its not just a matching game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I like the romantic dating in the trilogy  . I would read them again .<br />Great relaxing stories and intense at times.
B004GYY714|5.0|Well, I tried this app a couple of times and hated it because it kept cutting out - like literally every few minutes.  Finally, I decided to give it another chance and have had no issues.  Have used it several times now and really like it.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!<br />I am sure I am like one of the only ones that has yet to read this book but if not, BUMP IT UP THE TBR PILE AND READ IT NOW! 5*'s do not come easily from me , they must be earned . There is no rhyme or reason , its a feeling. If the story makes be feel, wakes me up, makes my tummy hurt, makes me literally chuckle out loud , and yes makes be sob out loud as well then it is deemed 5***** star worthy.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover I just don't know what to say. Your story telling is unique from any other I have read. Slammed, Point of Retreat , and now Hopeless, I don not know how you do it.<br /><br />The perfect word to describe Sky is resilient. I was proud of her. She is spunky, strong, more confident than she gives herself credit, and witty. She is a good friend and a good person. I was so intrigued by the scene where she see's Holden at the grocery store and he gives her the &#34;look&#34; . What was that look? Disgust? I was reeled in at that moment. Besides the Shayla /Shayna commentary...&#34;excuse me , I did speak English!&#34;. Bahahhaaa. I couldn't figure out Holder's angle and even when feelings were coming to light I kept thinking OMG someone is going do die, or what is he going to do to her, is he going to save her from Grayson? Nope, Ms. Hoover went far deeper to a story I did not expect at all. I did figure out one snippet (view spoiler) eventually after the other issues came to light. This story is so detailed and well thought out not one question is left by the end. From the first look, the commentary at the grocery store, the dollar bills falling out of her locker, counting of the stars,Sky's reluctance to presents wrapped or unwrapped, pinky finger holds, the scene at her first home and her encounter, the shower scene to the Mexican lunch scene. I could not have asked for anymore or anything better in this story.<br /><br />I loved Sky just as much as I loved Holder. Dean Holder, be still my heart. Wow, so complex, so simple, such the thinker, and such the sweetheart. Holder is intense and passionate but that is exactly what makes him so SWOON WORTHY.<br /><br />Sky having Holder to lean on through the ordeal made the suffering tolerable. Even when Holder was about to hear his shocker, the reader saw it coming and thought NO NO NO NO NO NOOOOOO (view spoiler) it was like a train wreck, my heart just broke.<br />The entire story line and each individual character was so intriguing the story could have gone several different ways.<br /><br />Breckin won my heart over as well as Six. Both of these characters were unique, fun, and detailed better than I have read in a long time.<br /><br />Writing the review immediately finishing the book probably not a smart idea as I am typing through tears and way too emotional.<br /><br />I am a sucker for heavy , emotional, angsty reads and this book did it for me. I have yet to find one person who didn't like this book.so simple, such the thinker, and such the sweetheart.

0066620996|5.0|The book has great examples and simple diagrams so it is easy to followed. Overall the book is written pretty well, I think everyone can find some value in Good to Great. Jim Collins has wonderful points and thoughts for the business success. He also uses many examples and real stories to make emotional connection with his readers. Since Mr. Collins used too many examples, chapters become a long story sessions with morals tossed. He had already proven his points with the stories but he still goes on to fluff on his book.<br />Jim Collins was mentioning the Circuit City is a great company. Since Good to Great was published before the collapse of Circuit City, that can make the reader think Collins research was on Circuit City is not right and also how much Circuit City could have changed in eight years. In that case his research becomes unrealistic and Mr. Collins could have lose their readers trusts.<br />Overall the book is great, since there are  many companies struggling today, Good to Great is an Excellent book to show the way to growth. They can apply the methods and  change their way to business to be more successful. This book is a great opportunity to have it and I highly recommended everyone to read it.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|I last read Camus' work in the 60s or 70s. So I was anxious to read The Stranger again and to see what I'd missed in my first reading, or how I had perhaps changed. When I did read it (last month) it was like reading a very different book. I was reminded, once again, of how much the reader him/herself brings to any book. If I'd really understood Camus 45 years ago, I would have made very different choices than I did. This has been an important book for most people in the world, and will continue to be. Camus is often categorized as an existentialist, though he argued that was not the case most of his life. Ignoring the literary pundits, his themes are much more about grasping the importance of being present to our own lives, and to appreciate how that presence impacts the world around us.

B00ERIUO02|5.0|I love Katy Perry's new album Prism. I'm so happy that her 3rd album went no. 1 on the billboard 200. :D I love her songs, like Roar, Birthday, Walking on Air, Unconditionally, Dark Horse w/ Juicy J, This is How We Do, International Smile, Double Rainbow, By the Grace of God, Spiritual, & It Takes Two. I got the album in the Zinepak at Wal-Mart. I'm lovin it.

B00EK0UBPU|3.0|Very richly written, and was great to read a great book about New Zealand in times past.  I found it a tad drawn out.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Well I applaud Suzanne Collins, the books were entrancing. Although I felt reminded of Twilight, two boys one girl dramatic plot and the main character is fighting to get what they want (to be a vampire and to Kill an evil president, how pleasant.) Besides that the series is great and the individual books consume your mind but such a disappointing ending for the series. I think that in reality Katniss goes crazy because everything is to much to handle and her last resort is Peeta because she lost everyone else. It is truly an awful note leave off on, Haymitch is drunk as ever, Peeta seems cured of his trip through psychopath town but who knows, Gale Katniss's long time best friend will never be in existence with Katniss again because she's just another Bella who can't make  up her mind, Prim and everyone Katniss loved, knew, befriended, or had even talked to has either dead or had forgotten her. The only thing satisfying about the ending is that Katniss ends up with Peeta an  that's only if you like Peeta more than Gale, I don't. }:<
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|PROS:<br />--Portability : about the size of a car key fob<br />--Relatively Easy setup<br />--Convert nearly any TV or projector into a \\"smart\\" device<br />--Great for travelers and roadwarriors, no more \\"idiot\\" tv's for you!<br />--Comes with a HDMI extender, no worries if you have a tight squeeze around your HDMI ports - google has you covered!<br />--Comes with wall wart and micro-USB<br /><br />CONS:<br />--Limited app support and functionality at this time; PEOPLE - KEEP IN MIND THIS HAS NO APPS ON IT! YOU MUST USE YOUR OTHER SMART DEVICE (laptop,tablet,phone, etc.)<br />--No way to overcome web based Wifi authentication<br /><br />IN THE BOX: Chromecast, micro USB cable(3ft), HDMI extender, USB wall wart (power block), papers.<br /><br />My scenario:<br />I bought it thinking I would use it for travel, get to a hotel and BAM! have a smart streaming TV with just this magical little device...1 problem, most hotel wifi use portal based authentication (i.e. webpage \\"accept\\" and click) which won't work with the chromecast, now casting locally stored videos (i.e. on your phone,tablet,etc already) that will most likely work ok. One work around would be to get a travel pocket router and use the hard line network jack in the hotel room to broadcast your own wifi for the chromecast to interface with, but now you have another gadget to haul around and setup just got more time consuming. Given that scenario, most people (including me) would rather just watch whatever on their tablet / laptop, and/or use an HDMI cable. Lets face it, most laptops and droids have HDMI (or micro/mini) and that means only lugging a single cable along with no setup time.<br /><br />Closing thoughts:<br />I had really hoped this was going to be more like a \\"droid-on-a-stick\\" device like you see from the china warehouse sites, alas it is only really just a connection portal for dumb TV's. In reality if you have a smart TV, DVD/Bluray, PS3/Xbox, etc. you really have little, to no need for this device. It is basically just a wireless HDMI port.<br /><br />While this doesn't work for my intended purpose, I don't fault the device. I would be crazy to think that this was the \\"one magic HDMI dongle to rule them all\\" gadget. If you have older LCD's in your house, this is a cheap way to upgrade to a smart device, especially given the price point, it's hard to go wrong.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Good but predictable. Not Denzel's best work. The ending seemed inevitable as a bad character redeems himself. Portrayal of NTSB was cartoonish.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I found this book gripping and intriguing.  I found the ending didn't tie things up as nicely as I had hoped.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Finally read book 3 of this series. Sylvia Day does not disappoint. I can't wait to read the next book.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Although it had a decent theme, the acting is ove-rbaked.  Special effects are fine, but not unusual compared to current technology.
B00G32OMF8|4.0|Bitter but real look at the long grind of modern no-villains marriage. Julie Delpy combines facial dewy and diabolical (ever since playing Dominique in Kieslowski's &#34;White&#34;) chillingly and is a formidable foe for the tolerant-to-a-fault Ethan Hawke, whose plans and pecadillos combine with Delpy's hormones to drive an explosive scene of reckoning (and quasi-reconciliation) that one suspects is far from final.  A conversational film like its predecessors, Before Midnight does the gear shift from everyday chit-chat to 100 mph over the cliff (and back again) as well as any Fiat out there.

It was great seeing not only the rise of this girl who would make a difference but the friends and loved ones that helped along the way. Also the change in Four was great and seeing the highs and lows of this beautiful romance molded through the fires of war. Be Brave readers

B0020MKTOS|5.0|He is a great actor and producer. What's not to love about all his movies!! It speaks about racism and has the best ending. You'll love this movie. There is some language, but other than that a great story.
B00G9U7R2O|1.0|Bad. Not very funny. Sends the wrong message to any kids watching. The story is about Sully and Mike being belittled by a college, including the staff and students,with bigotry and discrimination. We all know from the first movie that the team are the best at what they do,but the college kicks them out anyway, and refuses to acknowledge their talent.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This game is totally addictive, and lots of fun.  The app works well and there is a wide variety of spreads.  Some are quite simple and gratifying, others much more challenging.

8087830962|5.0|A Homage to Catalonia is George Orwell's personal account of his time fighting for the Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s.<br /><br /> This book is a marvelous war tale.  It is written in the clear voice of Orwell and describes the fighting, living and dying of the foreign volunteers.<br /><br /> Orwell also describes the politics and propaganda of the conflict.  Although Orwell is clearly fighting for the leftist faction in the war, he is very critical of the Communist, especially Stalinist propaganda that crafted public opinion.  One remarkable passage is when he recount's the overuse of the term &#34;Fascist.&#34;  He writes about Communist propagandists hurling insults such as &#34;'Trotsky-Fascist&#34; and &#34;Social-Fascist.&#34;  One must wonder if the &#34;Islamo-Fascist&#34; nonsense of the Neo-Conservatives grew out of 1930's Communist Propaganda.<br /><br />Eventually, the internal splits of the Spanish Republic come to get Orwell, he leaves Spain a step ahead of the Police.  Many of his friends are imprisoned in secret jails and never seen again.<br /><br />This is a great account of the Spanish Civil War.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent book!  A must read.The style of writing was unique especially the narration. I was worried that it was going to be an Anne Frank type book, which I tore me up as a child.  This was a beautiful read!

B00EQK5OG0|4.0|I try not to write anything about an album/box set that's already been reviewed.  But have you ever listened to something so good that you've felt compelled to tell other music fans about it?  Well, this is one of those times for me.  Now let me say that I'm not a fan of everything The Waterboys have released.  But I do own (in it's single and double CD versions) the \\"Fisherman's Blues\\" album, \\"Too Close To Heaven\\", and the \\"This Is The Sea\\" album.  For me these are the true classic, definitive albums by Mike Scott and his band.<br /><br />I'm not going to dissect this magnificent collection of songs.  If Amazon would post such a short review, and because interested people need something more informative before they spend their hard earned money, I would've just used the quote that's the title of this review.  Is every song here of equal worth?  No.  To each his own on that subject.  But taken together this body of work slips into that area reserved for only the best albums.<br /><br />I suggest you listen to the original albums if you're unfamiliar with The Waterboys, before you take the leap into this box set.  Hearing this music, the lyrics, and the mixture of original and cover songs, I'm sometimes reminded of another band that incorporated different musics into one style and sound--The Band and the \\"Basement Tapes\\" album.  The only real difference is the Irish feel (the use of a fiddle?) too many of these tunes, and some of the lyrics.  But the themes that run all through this set has (at least for me) that same sound and feel to it.<br /><br />For whatever reasons The Waterboys have never been \\"popular\\" with a lot of music fans.  Maybe its because they were thought of as an \\"Irish\\" band  playing nothing but \\"Irish\\" music.  Maybe they were thought of as a folk band (\\"play more rock'n'roll!\\") which might limit their appeal.  Or maybe its because their music was seemingly to \\"smart\\", to \\"literate\\", to \\"deep\\", or just plain  to \\"esoteric\\"  for most music fans.  And that's too bad because these are all misconceptions.  Yes, they're an Irish band that incorporated folk music (and other genres) into their overall sound.  And yes, their music is sometimes smart, literate, deep, and esoteric--and that's all to the good.  Once you listen to \\"Fisherman's Box\\", fans new and old will find a lot of good/great music collected here, and that's the bottom line.<br /><br />But that's not all there is to this band.  Their music was a mixture of r'n'r, blues, folk, Irish, country, and gospel music--all mixed in with leader Mike Scott's visionary lyrics--into something approaching traditional music.  Something The Band did also.  The \\"Deluxe\\" edition of this set has a seventh CD filled with blues, gospel and other influences--and it's telling.  This box set goes further down that path of forging different musics and Scott's lyrics into a slightly different shape.  than previous releases.  Early on in this set we hear the original song \\"Fisherman's Blues (early version)\\", with Mike Scott on piano and vocals with the rest of the band.  You can hear him calling out chord changes to the band as they play.  And right after that we hear the finished tune in all it's mystery.  Drums, bass, fiddle, mandolin, and Scott switching to guitar is all that's needed to embellish this fine song.  And the lyrics are one of the defining moments for both Scott and the band--just listen and you'll understand.  And there's plenty more where that came from.  At times the music has an epic, big sound and feel to it.  Other times you can hear Scott and the band feeling their way through a raggedy fragment of a song.  And it's this inside look at the band working on their music that gives this set a strange yet wonderful cohesiveness.<br /><br />I can't help but think that once you listen to The Waterboys you too will be captivated by their wide open, big sound.  With a combination of original songs and covers there's a lot of good music here.  Even if you were to discount the working versions of some of these tunes, there's still a lot left to wonder over.  And the cover songs help define what Scott and the band were all about during this period.  But I've written enough--you'll either give this a listen and think \\"wow\\", or you'll pass it by.  To each his own.  But I do feel better for (hopefully) letting more people know about this great collection (at least the way I hear this music) of songs and performances.<br /><br />In the booklet notes Mike Scott also talks about the last recording by the band, on the final night of recording (Dylan's \\"Buckets of Rain\\"), and then it was all over.  This music has something special about it, something you don't want to end.  But it doesn't have to.  The adventure can begin again by simply slipping that first disc into your player.  And the adventure with Mike Scott and The Waterboys begins again!  It's that kind of music.  It's that special.<br /><br />The packaging is well thought out.  The lidded box is thick, the booklet is very informative with track notes by Mike Scott, along with other pertinent information and photos.  Each CD sleeve has the date, location and song titles to better get a handle on the music.  And the sound is very good to excellent.  All in all--everything you'd want for such a great collection of songs.scount the working versions of some of these tunes, there's still a lot left to wonder over.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|This is a great game but.....too many obstacles requiring you to play it over and over and over.  I love a challenge but I don't like to feel defeated before I start, that is how this game makes you feel on some levels. If this games takes over two weeks to complete a level, that is NO fun!!!
B000001FSU|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Anthrax albums even though it doesn’t get as much praise as their older releases.  I’m a big fan of “Spreading the Disease” and “Among the Living” myself, but “State of Euphoria” has some excellent music on it.  It’s a perfect medium between “Among” and the album they did after “Euphoria”, “Persistence of Time”.  “Among” epitomized mid-80’s thrash with its fast, swinging style, while “Euphoria” brought Anthrax into more refined territory.  And even though “Euphoria” is not quite as speedy as “Among”, the music and vocals are superb.  I’ll never tire of songs like “Be All, End All”, “Out of Sight, Out of Mind”, “Now it’s Dark”, and “Misery Loves Company”, all tracks with the just the right mix of speed, riffing, and melodic sensibility.  I also think this album and “Persistence” are the two best vocal performances of Joey Belladonna’s career.  He had mastered the range between aggressive metal singing and that soaring falsetto that was nearly out of control at times on “Spreading the Disease” and “Among the Living”.  If you want to hear one of the best examples of quality late-80’s thrash, give “State of Euphoria” a spin.  Anthrax was on top of their game.

B00BC24NT4|4.0|As an avid fan I have read everything le Carre has published beginning with Dial For Murder (before The Spy Who Came In from The Cold).  The author could have abandoned the genre' with the end of the Cold War and the destruction of the Berlin Wall.  He has consistently produced well conceived and executed novels reflecting the changing political realities and the British spy apparatus efforts to meet the challenges those realities present.  A Delicate Truth is no exception.  The language alone would warrant the four and one half stars and the characters and circumstances are exceptionally well drawn.  Nobody does it better.

It also was very well written as it flowed nicely....530 ish pages and I kept wanting to turn the page.  Just sorry that my work interfered with my reading time.<br />My only problem is WHAT TO READ NEXT.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It is a fun and addictive game. However, it is annoying in that after several tries at a given level it &#34;times out&#34; and you either wait up to; 30 minutes for &#34;more lives&#34; or you click the button to pay more money.  Also, you are offered extra &#34;features&#34; for money in order to solve given levels.  We are currently at Level 30 and even with the first bonus payment, have not solved it.  DON'T LET YOUR KIDS AT IT WITH AN OPEN CHARGE CARD.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I own all of the Dexter seasons and just love everyone of them.  The characters and how they interact, the story lines.  Just wish they had left out Deb's potty mouth.  It is not needed to have a good show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The Living and Giving and Lying and Dying is almost too much. The acting is flawless. The interactions are captivating.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie made me buy the whole series of books.  The casting is superb.  Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent Katniss.  This was well filmed also.  Even though the subject matter may be questionable for kids, the filming took great care of getting the point across without making this graphic and gory.
B00ENYCQX8|1.0|I tried to read several non Amazon ebooks and none of them would load. It keeps asking to at adware.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Awesome movie.  I love any movie about animals.  What is so wonderful is it it a TRUE story.  I love it when people help God's creatures.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|my granddaughter loves it. she plays it all the time and tries to beat my score. keep them coming for her.
B00FEX1AA2|3.0|Good scare!  Suspenseful and haunting without all the blood and gore.  I was surprised at the well known actors in this.  Well acted, well written and well filmed.
B008220D5K|5.0|When you buy a RENTAL copy of this movie on DVD (or pretty much every other movie on DVD), you do not get any of the bonus features.  So you may think you are saving money but you'll only get a teasing Bonus menu where everything is disabled.  I had gotten burned on two previous DVDs from Blockbuster where the Special Features would have been so sweet (and unfortunately I had forgotten for this purchase).  This is 40 has some excellent Bonus Features.  If you like these, go for a non-Rental or new DVD of this movie.
B005F3XV62|5.0|Love this movie, it is soooo good.  Funny, funny, funny and I do not remember any unnecessary cussing and sexual situations.
1455525839|4.0|After a couple goofy about Pendergast's wife and son(Seriously, did he have to dredge up Nazis to be his modern day villians!!!), this one is right back on track.  Pendergast and his sometimes student research a century old animal attack and instead discover a series of murders whose consequences reverberate to the modern day.  This is classic Pendargast and much better than the last couple books.<br />Minor complaints-The whole thing about going into a Tibetan trance to time travel back to a conversation between Doyle and Oscar Wilde is just too silly for words.  Also, if you are going to use modern slang, get the terms right.  A term that was coined by Rush Limbaugh(which the Amazon censors will not allow me to type here)would be appropriate to describe the crooked female real estate developer and not Pendergast's protégé, as the author does.<br />However, aside from a few minor problems, this is a good read(or I wouldn't have given it five stars)
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|her quality of writing isn't as strong as in her earlier books. Too many acronyms and not as &#34;nail biting&#34; to keep your interest going
B005GIS1WA|5.0|The movie has great color and a great message.  The music & songs are also very good & catchy.  All around good family movie!
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|My daughter LOVES this album. She's been listening to it non-stop since the movie opened. As a parent, I was pleased to see so many songs for such an inexpensive price.
B00GTZJLAK|5.0|Watch This!  Absolutely the best movie of the year.  A Great story.  Great production. Accurate airplanes and very likable characters.  This is the movie my wife and I love to see over and over.  We bought it on Amazon.  Contains everything good you want your kids to see.
B00F35BV64|5.0|i for one loved it. the plot was good paced at first but then sped up near the end. which was good and enough action to get you thinking, &#34;what?&#34; loved it. i'd say a good sequel.
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|Had the free then upgraded to paid, but when installing the free one was not removed.<br />For layout settings no other can be selected.<br />Wish the 4 * 1 widget could have clock too.<br /><br />Will I keep? Yes, because I can have local weather &amp; local time in each widget.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|I love Bruder trucks for my boys. They look very true to life and they are made very well and sturdy. The trucks cam still break but they take a heavy beating first. Doors open and you can put an action figure in the driver's seat. Engine also opens. Tires have realistic suspension. Easy to clean with a hose. Would definitely buy more Bruder toys.
B00C1C09MO|3.0|Fun family movie, predictable at times but still an up and fun way to spend a few hrs. Rowan Atkins is one of a kind!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This keeps my 3 yr old entertained for hours. She loves feeding and brushing the horses.  The only problem us you have to pay to get better horses and places to ride but it's free so I can't complain.
B00GLQQ07E|5.0|If you love the classic Disney musicals, ala Beauty and the Beast, Frozen is a near - flawless film.  Sweet, funny and loaded with some of the best voices of our time.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|Great read from the first chapter.  Great sense of humor, one liners and pretty realistic.  Loved the part of Muffy too.
B00005JL96|5.0|If he likes it then it must be okay in my book....I personally liked part 2 better. But its cute.
B00ESNE696|5.0|I love this show, never a dull moment!! The new ethic person is naming her baby Peter?? Um hello!! No, that won't be misunderstood at all!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is an amazing game I have played before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!more people should play it!!!!!!!!!but it is going to be a long time to beat it
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|What a great collection of short stories! As an avid SF reader and sometimes SF writer, I found myself immediately drawn in by the clean writing style and well rendered alternate futures in this book. It was also fascinating to see the genre through a different cultural perspective. I’m not sure what was lost in translation, but I found the stories to be highly accessible, satisfying, and often quite erotic. I really enjoyed how the author bridged many subgenres of speculative fiction. With alien vampires, cyberpunk-esque high-tech futures, sexual service robots and all things in-between, this book really gives you everything! Also, the hot stuff was well…HOT! Galactic Energies is an excellent addition to your SF and erotic romance bookshelf, and I recommend it highly!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers is cool game and I amostl have all the characters I have Lucy Tagbot Carnot King and I got 3000 something coins
0804161380|5.0|Really love this box set. Everything was as pictured and it's really well made. The only thing disappointing was that it didn't come with the extras you would have gotten if you bought the books separately.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Every episode is spectacular, and all they usually are is non stop talking. Best drama I've ever seen, besides NCIS.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|It was pretty good but it wasn't all I thought it would be  . It needs more exciting actions but it was pretty good
B00AEFY5B6|5.0|Never a bad choice, I don't really think I need to write a review for such an old but great movie it is by far my favorite movie on my shelf.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I can't wait to re-watch all the episodes from season one!!! Great book with soooo many details!!! Really paints a picture in your mind of all the characters and places in the novel.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is my favorite author and her Scarpetta series is the best! She really knows her stuff because of her background and she writes fantastic books that leave you guessing until the very end!! Keep them coming, Ms. Cornwell!!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Theses headphones are great.  I needed them for film school and they have held up for a year now.  I'm not an expert on headphones, but a professional sound mixer suggested we all buy these.  They were worth the money and reasonably priced.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|So boring I didn't finish it.  I know he was suppose to be a literary genius, but I think his suicide  inflated his reviews.  It is rare that I'll read as much as half a book and not follow through to the end, but I didn't think this one was worth the effort
B00EW9GQR6|4.0|I have enjoyed Gaga's music since her first, not so popular, album. This album has a pop feel to it but also a bit of Electronic feel too. I feel like some songs she channels Madonna in.<br />I'm very pleased with this album. Go Gaga!
B002VUFKG6|4.0|Insightful memoir about the honesty of contemplating marriage.  I loved all the history lessons, very thought-provoking as a married woman myself.  Overall, a great follow-up to Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray, Love.
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|This album was AMAZING. I usually do not buy albums, but my friend had this one and I fell in love with the songs. It is very unique for an album of today. She sings beautifully and her songs aren't just talking about sexual promiscuity. I honestly believe these are classic songs that everyone could listen to.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|would have rated it 5 stars, but the ending was not on a par to the build-up throughout the whole book...
B00GD9F59S|5.0|This was the 2nd series by Jennifer Armentrout that I got addicted to and can't get enough of!  I love the strong connection and bond that Alex and Aiden  shared throughout the Covenant world.  I am truly saddened the series has come to an end.  Hoping this series gets made into a movie!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This novel is an epic set in the 19th century, but its story is timeless. Gilbert grasps the humanity of scientists, and especially the humanity and sexuality of a woman who happens to be a scientist. Her prose clarifies the joys of science - the chance to know something previously unknown, the chance to formulate and test your own ideas, the chance to extract the big picture from an intimate knowledge of the details, and, ultimately, the chance to share this passion for synthesis with like-minded human beings.<br /><br />Perhaps only a scientist can read the words, &#34;This means there were three of us,&#34; and feel the power of a life's work suddenly, unexpectedly, justly, knowledgeably and authentically praised. Gilbert somehow knows that only a slight change in perspective differentiates art from science, and her novel is a beautiful admixture that invites us to traverse the planet in the company of an enormous number of enchantingly drawn characters, each deeper and wiser than you expect them to be.<br /><br />If you value beauty, read this book. If you know science well enough to see its humanity and its heart, read this book. If you both value beauty and know science from the inside, read The Signature of All Things... slowly.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was such a great series.  Was surprised to find it at such a great price.  Now we can freeze the show to catch up with the fast-paced dialogue.  A winner!
1609611543|1.0|As someone diagnosed with Celiac 42 years ago, before it was cool and hip, there is nothing worse than someone who tries to pretend they have it because they are 'gluten sensitive'. Everyone's gluten sensitive. It's like having cancer and because someone is sick and feels horrible they try and empathize with you. Gluten is bad. We get it. But it's the new cool hip thing and it's a giant middle finger to us who have celiac antibodies raging through our system when we accidentally eat wheat. And FYI, even we who actually have it can live fine as long as gluten foods make up less than %10 of your diet.<br />This author is just trying to make a buck off you jerk weeds who now think you have celiac. Guess what!?! Half the population didn't get gluten sensitivity overnight! This is all a fad. And whomever invented gluten free playdoh needs their head checked. What next? Is HIV gonna be cool and everyone is going to assume they have it?
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise. I never expected it to be as entertaining as it was. My best friend grew up with a speech problem and this movie highlights all the problems that come with that disability. And the fact that being wealthy doesn't save you from those problems. Forced by fate to overcome.....
B008LY9AWG|3.0|Not a bad read, but not much substance. Certainly not up to the quality of his novels. They all look like<br />first drafts that were bundled together to get a few extra bucks out of the pockets of Connelly's fans. For $0.99 it would be ok, but not for what it costs.
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|My two-year-old loves &#34;Sofia the First&#34; and now she can play with the whole family. These figures are good sizes and I love the colors.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Fascinating, haunting, inspired writing  from one of the great novelist's of our time maybe of all time, with such brilliant phrases as &#34;his smile was like dial soap&#34; well f- me right.
B00BPDR3F6|2.0|Not a fan of the writing style in this book. Loved Eat Pray Love but some of the lines in this one are super cheesy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome book with many twists and turns.  I would recommend this book for ages 8-15, but it is a fun book for all to read.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The reason that I got this app was because I can sync the work that I've done onto my Kindle Fire. I wish though that on the Kindle I could change text size & on both the Kindle & mac be able to shrink the picture. Other wise though. I love this app!!!!!!
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Sweet, and Heartwarming! Thank you Debbie Macomber for mentioning this movie in your book &#34;Starry Night&#34;.  After reading &#34;Starry Night&#34;  I couldn't shake this feeling I had to check Amazon instant video for this movie, and I'm glad I did. I loved the movie and the book that led me to it!
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|That makes a HUGE difference in my videos under 10 feet of water.  Do not waste money on a GoPro for SCUBA unless you get this.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|This was a present for a friend.  It is one of the great spy stories and the cast is excellent.  I hear that De Niro is making a sequel for cable.  I look forward to it.
B00499DRJO|4.0|Theta Healing is a fascinating subject. Well delivered by Vianna, who writes from years of experience and research. I learned so much and easily put it into practise.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A good read!  The author did an excellent job of weaving the characters together and keeping them interesting throughout the story.  I will recommend this book to my friends!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|All hype - no content.  You have to use Chrome browser, Netflix, or YouTube.  spend the extra cash and get a Roku.
0399157573|3.0|I have read about half of this book and it literally drags you around in a dark haze. After 240 pages, they have just cleared the crime scene and brought  the body in for autopsy. Hopefully the last half will be at a faster pace. I love all the characters but they need to have a few action scenes and less technical jargon. After so many books with these characters, we regular readers are well versed with the idiosyncrasies of Lucy, Marino and Benton .We do not have to be tediously and laboriously retuned to all of their character flaws to begin every new book.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|Purchased this as a gift for my Mother she loves Dame Judy Dench. Purchase the first and this second series have to say I enjoyed them also, period series like this if done well are a look back in time and BBC really can produce these like no-one else. This second series did seem to have a lot of misfortune for several characters felt sometimes too much. But overall an excellent follow-up.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This movie tells the about a young boy who is unsure about his feelings for Santa. The picture quality and story are like no other
B008602KQI|4.0|Well done adaption of the novel. It's only missing the last star because I felt some of the bits left out would have helped to explain a lot more of what's going on in the end.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I LOVE this app!  I don't even have a 100% grasp on all the functions or how they work, I just slide some things around the screen and I'm instantly making cool, morphing idm-y electro music.  So fun and the sounds are amazing.  Wnat a steal at $1.95.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Great Star Wars story. But who picked that kid to play Skywalker just awful, sorry, but thought he was so wrong for that role, reminded me of a bad male impersonator of Shirley Temple. Other than that and some questionable technology appearing more advanced than the earlier three films, which were to have taken place long after this story, this was still a very good but flawed pre-quel...
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Best reliable alarm I have tried on my Kindle Fire.  Do not need tablet in ON mode for it to work.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Be better if money wasn't so important, but I still enjoy the game play and building a town with goals
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|Slow reading, not like a lot of her books that I couldn't put down.  This is taking me a long time to read.
B000062X90|5.0|I bought this album on speculation not having heard Wishbone Ash before. I have to say I was thoroughly blown away by the quality of musicianship of this group. This album has it all, great vocals and brilliant guitar work and all put together for excellent music on every song. No dud songs on this one. I would highly reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys guitar work. You won't be disappointed
B009NY43NY|5.0|I am so sad that I have just finished the last book of the series.  This was one of the best series of books that I have ever read.  I have loved every book and highly recommend this series!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I thought it was a good read, easier to follow when reading in longer periods of time (due to different story lines).  Left me wanting more...
0399224459|5.0|I read this book to my children many years ago. I just bought it for my nephew's 5 year old son.
B00E9P959O|2.0|I have most of Rush albums on vinyl and cd. That is to say I replaced my vinyl editions with cd's. I would not like to think of someone buying this album as their first introduction to the band Rush. The earlier albums were alive with bass that kicked butt and brilliant guitar work from Lifeson and of course excellent drumming. I bought the muddy version of vapor trails and failed to be impressed. So I bought this remixed version and honestly it didn't do much for me. I have tried to listen to this album and find something positive about it but to me and this is my opinion it is tedious to the point of boring. There is no exciting lead breaks and the Rickenbacker bass is missing. I love my Rush collection but I stopped at this one as it just simply didn't push my buttons. If you are new to Rush check out their earlier music as it was far more interesting and enjoyable. Apologies to other Rush fans but as I said this just my opinion.
B00E9A656K|5.0|The best I played in a while.Great selection of cars. Outstanding graphics, very hard to stop playing!, Easy to move up in levels for rookies.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I love all things Tolkien and the Hobbit expressed the book very well. The extended edition does not provide as much extra footage as I would have liked (13 minutes, compared to 30-55 minutes in the LOTR trilogy extendeds) but the 9 hours of bonus features makes up for this shortcoming. Overall, a must have for Tolkien and Peter Jackson fans.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Denzel is caught in an impossible situation.  He is probably the only person on the planet who could have saved as many as he did, however, his drinking problem will muddy the waters forever.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|It's what I was looking for and it's sleek. Hopefully it will last, also in future versions I wish that the usb is detachable so it wouldn't be easily tear under many uses.
B00GIXY4M8|2.0|shame, excited to see this flick but the story, acting and lame fight scenes left me bored and distracted.  wait for it to be a cheap rental if you are a wolverine fan.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|Was very pleased with the Blu-Ray, great picture and sound quality.<br /><br />Blu-Ray makes the film feel more surreal than before.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very much addictive for all ages.  My 3 year old grand sons love playing it as my wife and are are also hooked.  Read about it in Time article and had to try it.  we play for free and dont pay the extra for other lives.  Just wait the time out and start again.  See where they add new levels every week.
0062107313|1.0|I signed up early for this book as Amy Tan is one of my favorite authors. It started out good then moved into a cheap romance novel. I began to hate the main characters, they were very annoying, It was hard to finish the book.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Wonderful!  I love this take on an old classic!  I'd have to give this a 10 star rating -- 10 out of 5!  Can I have the next Season, please?  So often we lose the depth of character in these classics when they are modernized.  This time, however, we get yet more insight into the obsessive-compulsive character of Holmes and the adrenaline needs of Watson.  I love the twist on Watson's character.  So much more depth!  Watch it and fall in love with a great new series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome I would say for kids 7+ its fast paced I got it for my son I can't keep him off it he loves it.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|My grandsons just laughed and laughed while watching this series.  Very entertaining and wholesum family fun.  Would reccomend to my friends with children
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is the best app that I have found. The app allows the user to change the sounds allowing for a unique blend of your favorite sounds. With a tap of the screen truns on the individual sound with audio adjustment to raise or lower the individual sound. I prefer to listen and rest to rain, waterfall low crickets and faint thunder in the background. With this app I can get exactly what I desire to fall deep asleep. THANK YOU Ipnos for creating this app....
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I used to enjoy this app, but now I lose a lot of drawings when it tells me to stop playing on multiple devices. I only play it on one freaking device. Might stop all together.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is an enjoyable app. I find myself to be addicted playing this game. The  only problems. I see in the game are if  you want to connect and join Facebook.
B00CNQ7CRI|4.0|I loved the first two books and hadn't realized how much I missed her honest narcissism until I read this one. Funny read. Hope they make this one a movie to!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is ah great game to have fun playing, plain & simple. There r no blood & guts just simple fun. As w/ all good games it has its addiction though, hahaha...not that that's ah bad thing.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I've been reading John Grisham since I was 11.  I was disappointed in his last few novels, but I loved A Time To Kill and so I eagerly picked this one up.  I had my suspicions pretty quickly, but assumed that my predictions were to 'small', so I couldn't put it down.  I couldn't wait for the big reveal.  It turns out that after a book that dragged out way too long, what I had guessed immediately WAS the reveal.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I love this album since December is here and Christmas is around the corner this album just gets you in the holiday spirits!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I gave it 3 stars at first, because I had a kindle fire. I got another device and I love it. Great app and lots of choices, I'm not limited anymore.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've owned many pairs of headphones, including 2 other wireless headsets, the first was a much older Sennheiser model with no mic (so yea I guess not a headset) but it had horrible feedback issues and the range was poor. I bought a bluetooth wireless headset from a company called August and while the sound was really impressive for $40 blutooth headphones, there was still the delay caused by all Bluetooth devices that made gaming impossible. I bought a refurbished pair of these and I am extremely happy with my purchase. Considering I bought these for $80 in like new condition with zero issues, that is a real steal.<br /><br />So far I've mainly been using these for Teamspeak and Battlefield 4 but the sound quality is definitely worth the money, I would pay anywhere from $100-130 for headphones like this. I did my research as to the best wireless PC gaming headset you can get for your money and this is definitely #1. I can't speak from personal experience with the Turtlebeach headphones but from reading user reviews it seems they are not designed to be used for PC so there is not much customization in the software.<br /><br />Some people might be afraid of buying a wireless headset because they have that internal rechargeable battery that can die, leaving you with a very expensive, but useless piece of plastic and metal. You can buy replacement batteries for $12 with prime shipping and you just need to remove a few screws from behind one of the leather ear cups. You can get those here:<br />[[ASIN:B005GK50W2 B005GK50W2]]<br /><br />That being said, even with my refurbished pair, I played for 6 hours straight yesterday also using the mic in teamspeak the entire time and the battery never died on me. Since it comes with a long USB extension for charging, it only takes two seconds to plug the cable in and continue gaming like nothing happened; there is zero interruption to your audio when you begin a charge and it seems to charge in under 2 hours. As for the range, I have a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, single story house and I can leave my office on one side of the house...go to the kitchen, the garage, I've even used them while taking a bath on the opposite side of the house between multiple walls. Overall, I'm super impressed with these. When Steam comes out with their Streaming to TV services, this will be really useful as  I will be able to walk around my house and play my games on any TV.<br /><br />The only small negatives I can think of would be that the bass can seem a bit blown out at times and I'm not sure if that's just because my pair was refurbished, sometimes a huge explosion will happen in Battlefield 4 and it just sounds like a mess, however I cranked up my bass as high as it goes and messed with the EQ so take that into consideration.<br /><br /> Another thing to mention is even having a small head such as I do, the headset can start to become a little painful on your ears. After using dozens of headphones and headsets, I've come to realize that this issue is pretty much impossible to get around if you plan on having them on for multiple hours, but I've definitely felt less comfortable headphones than the G930's.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to any PC Gamer who is sick of dealing with wires, the sound is almost as good as my V-Moda LP2 wired studio headphones, and that is saying something indeed.ve a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, single story house and I can leave my office on one side of the house...go to the kitchen, the garage, I've even used them while taking a bath on the opposite side of the house between multiple walls.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is truly talented and keeps you hanging on; her books can be fairly graphic at times, and she keeps you in suspense as you try to figure out who did it and how they will be caught.  I particularly love the Scarpetta series.
B0029VUV70|4.0|Very thought provoking...would you be able to save someone's life if it meant exposing yourself?  There are two versions of that same them in this story.  I would have liked the ending to be expanded a bit...but that would have been yet another story.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|All the music sounded exactly like the real thing  I'm in to meditation and relaxing , and this app is on the money
B005H9B2CE|4.0|we got some good laughs, for what it is it was a good movie.worth the rent okay for kids of all ages
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Really enjoy this app, great way to pass time when bored, especially when you get hooked trying to clear a level you got stuck on. Plus the game itself is FREE, zero obligation
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Typical good versus evil high tech movie (including Thor's hammer).  Lots of noise, minimal plot but a good way to spend some time out of mind.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I recommend this book highly. I kept wanting to read one more chapter every time I picked it up even when I was sleepy since the only time I get to read is at bedtime. I want to read more from this author.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I saw Hugh Laurie in a video singing some of these songs and I really enjoyed his singing, very jazzy with lots of feeling. I think that he is a true lover of jazz and the blues and he proves it with this album. I will buy more of his music. Of course I enjoyed his acting in House.
067144901X|5.0|We ordered this for our three year old son as he LOVES all of his other books by Sandra Boynton. I'm sure that he will be thrilled to open this present for the holidays!
0316055433|1.0|Please explain to me where I am wrong, and I'll delete this review.  (I haven't yet finished reading the novel, but have enough information to establish an opinion about the flow, the pace, the plot. But that's not what concerns me today.)<br /><br />OK, the narrator starts out by saying he is 27 years old and recalls events which happened 14 years earlier, correct?  Let us be generous and say it is 2013 in this critically acclaimed novel (although it must have been written and finished earlier than this year), and 14 years earlier when the narrator was 13 years old was, let's see,  1999, right? (D'uh!) (I've found no indications that the narration starts out in the future!)  Everyone in this novel has a cellphone.  The 13 year old narrator has an iPod. The iPod was introduced by Apple in 2001.  There are references to Harry Potter.  OK, the first Harry Potter volume was published in 1997.  What about the reference to the shoe bomber? (2001 as well.) Las Vegas, we are made to understand,  is undergoing a housing crisis in 1999, abandoned homes, desert reclaiming developments, cheap rents (check yourself if that is true for the late 1990s.)  Well, at least the 1933 movie \\"SOS Iceberg\\" checks out, although how and where these 13 year old characters had heard of such an obscure film is not explained.<br /><br />And if the narrative is indeed in the future and time remembered by the narrator now in 2013, then how many 13 year olds  today (or anyone?) would know or remember the shoe bomber of 2001?<br /><br />More.  Theo's Las Vegas pal is for an unexplained reason tri-national, Polish, Ukrainian and Russian.  Or is the reason to show his vast knowledge of obscenities in three and more (he's widely traveled) languages?  You should savor the conversations between Theo and this Boris (or Borys in Ukrainian, as the author sees necessary to inform us), endless exchanges of eF words, and later on cryptic cellphone text messages (again in 1999, at the latest.)<br /><br />You can mess with geography and weather in fiction. You can invent events, such as the museum bombing in this novel, invent cities and streets, businesses on existing streets,  but when you start messing with time, you've entered the science fiction category and even science fiction has its rules which this novel does not seem to observe. End result is a confused, distracted reader.
B000286RKW|5.0|I couldn't give this less than 5 stars unless the DVD was awful, but it's great so it get 5 stars. I love the commentaries. One of the best films ever made. Should have gotten a best picture Oscar!
B009EAO38C|5.0|These guys are amazingly talented! Now I'm just writing to fill up the requirement - truly amazing - if you like piano/cello these guys are a must.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Super easy to customize and the game play is fun yet challenging. It's give my brain a workout but at the same time relaxes me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Haven't read anything this good in sooooooo long! Didn't know what to expect so I was completely blown away. I really wanted her to pay though.......pay big! Must be the man in me! Lol
B00C7607FS|5.0|I got this one for the kid and it's really good. Very high quality Blu-ray Excellent picture and sound, it's Disney so no suprise there. I like the fact that it's combo pack because my daughter has a DVD player, not a Blu-ray in her room.
B007IV11PM|5.0|One of the best shows - witty, a little cheesy (okay maybe more than a little but that's part of the fun!), and these later seasons exhibit MUCH better acting talent than the first season did.
1400067936|5.0|A once in a generation author writes a once in a generation book. The writing is pointed, skeptical and irreverent. NNT hammers home the message that humans are fooled in particular and predictable ways. This book will change the way you view any profession with a large pool of beginners and only a few winners (sales, authors, finance, musicians, etc.). It will also make you think about the many ways in which you fool yourself. NNT's optimal strategy is to work a boring, impossible to be fired from job and moonlight making large payoff careers on the side. He will make you question the wisdom of taking on any debt, even &#34;good debt&#34; like a house or student loans. Your life will never be the same after this book. I read it 7 years ago and I still reference it everyday.
B007SGM084|4.0|It took some time to draw out the characters in the first book . I don't know much about the life style presented in the story  of this book but I have enjoyed getting to know Christian. To borrow a line from Christian \\"this is all I know\\". I  well I have to say it was worth it.
0066620996|5.0|Good to Great is not a good book, but a GREAT book. Upon first being assigned this book, I was not looking forward to it since it was not a novel and therefore I assumed it would be a bit more difficult to follow. However, the book was great. The best thing about the book is its overall organization. The author first defines a good to great organization, then he organizes the book by the requirements to become a good to great business.<br /><br />This book is a great compilation of very useful research. He identifies the companies that follow the good-to-great characteristics. He then researches the leadership and market to identify what made these companies great. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|READ!!!!!!  READ!!!!!!  READ!!!!!!  READ!!!!!!  READ!!!!!!  READ!!!!!!  READ!!!!!!<br /><br /> There r not many choices to do hair.  It would be great if you could do their make up and clothes.  That would be BEYOND awesome!!!!!!!!!

B009LA1QW6|5.0|Veryyy chill album. This is the musical side compared to Born to Die. Definitely a more sloww, darker tone. No song has a &#34;hip&#34; &#34;upbeat&#34; feel like Born to Die but still a nice album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is a awesome game but I would be cool to spawn creepers on creative and have flint and steel on creative:)

B005BRS8Z6|1.0|Not a big fan elementary stuff, maybe I'm not the correct target group for this book. Not bad for a beginning read, easy read
1586216880|5.0|Autobiography of Mandela was key to this book because you know exactly what he went through and not what someone else made up to add excitement to the story.  I bought the audio version, so Danny Glover is reading the story, and he can be a bit annoying in his attempt at dialects.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Gotta love and chuckle at this spunky guy, and the plot twists and the various characters in the story. Especially charming are the way the conversations are politely and matter-of-factly related. Definitely will recommend to other readers.
B0089LOG02|5.0|An interesting part of American history I did not know about, and the intersection of two women, old and young, having similar experiences in growing up.  Sadly while we now have a &#34;system&#34; and &#34;rules&#34;, I'm not sure the result is much better for the child.
B00002E233|5.0|I am so happy that amazon had this movie ... One of my favorite movies  ... I would recommend this product to friends and family ...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Narrated was abit unnerving but. the story teaches a great. lesson about life.<br />I hope you enjoy it.<br />Good luck.
B00BAXFECK|1.0|The book came through all screwed up and I am unable to read it.  Keeps repeating and/or skipping pages.  Don't know how to fix it.
0393051587|5.0|I am teaching an Advent class at my church on A CHRISTMAS CAROL.  The annotated version is chock full of interesting information and certainly adds to my presentation.  I've even used some of the numerous illustrations.  So glad it is NOT abridged!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Just love popping all those bubbles and enjoying all the different levels and wondering what the next challenge will be .
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The wizard of oz is an amazing story that keeps you captivated till the very end. It has inspired me to download all the other 13 books after this one.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I loved this book.  It got a bit bogged down about 3/4 way through with heavy stuff  that I thought was not so needed but every other minute of it was soooo good.  Twists and turns, great characters that were connected by so man threads throughout the whole book and it was nice to not just have a wrapped up happy ending that would not have been called for
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My wife loves this movie, it is the second time we have purchased it, first one was stolen. Great Christmas gift
B003THHIEM|5.0|Great cast, awesome story lines and plots...  And funny too!  One of my favorites!  It's no wonder why it has lasted so long on t.v.
B00EKXDVOK|2.0|I really like Streisand.  I think she's has the best voice of all.  However, this CD is, well, boring.  All the songs but one are sang in a very slow, boring tempo.  The one that is not is over-the-top the other way around.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Interesting premise to update the ageless classic,however,for me it just wasn't enough to entice me to view more than the first episode.  Nice try.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|My wife loves this movie, it is the second time we have purchased it, first one was stolen. Great Christmas gift
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book was great. I loved all the detail :) I hope you enjoy the book as much as me
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great Family movie if your kiddos are at least 12 years old and older. Went right along with the book. I appreciate the lack of bad language in this movie as well. Good action/suspense and leaves you wanting to see the next movie.
0810995522|4.0|This came the way it said, our son loves the books and this was just as good as going to the store to buy a new one.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Because epic knows epic, and Star Wars is lookin real familiar right now.  Han shot first, don't try to argue.
B00GX50BD2|2.0|I found this movie a bit of a bore and it really didn't capture the essence of the time.  I have read enough about Apple and having grown up using a MacIntosh just didn't feel that this film  contributed to anything that was of importance to the epic of personal computing. Kutcher played the part well, but bad script.  It played like a made for TV movie.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I think the movie was authentic to the Bond details as in previous movies.  The movie made me take real notice of Daniel Craig, he did fill the Bond suit wonderfully.  I love Scotland no need to say any more, you have to see the movie.
B00E8TWPI4|5.0|I got the movie for my 8 year old daughter to watch during a road trip. She loved it. Sang the songs, laughed and truly was entertained by the film.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a fun game for everyone! It is so easy to learn and to play. Even my 7 year old can play. Neat game for a low price.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|My whole family of nerds loved this movie especially since this man's vision has changed our lives. We had read the book also and the movie followed the development of his ideas.  Ashton Kutcher was unrecognizable in this.  He looked like and was Jobs.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is the Superb Ultimate Musical, Its the very best of the best, Hands Down!  There is nothing more to say.
B003TOPQI0|5.0|This is one of Brad Pitt's best performances. This movie is right up there with Fight Club in terms of action.
B00FQUACUM|5.0|These young men have such beautiful voices. I love the mix of Christmas songs. I am so glad I saw them on Hallmark Channel's HOME & FAMILY.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|This is another excellent book by Preston and Child.  I've enjoyed all of the Pendergast series, and this one didn't disappoint.  There's a great deal of suspense, and many twists and turns.  I'd recommend this book.
B00GINENG0|4.0|My granddaughter love playing with Tom. She talks with him all the time. She lives to pet him and hear him purr
031632406X|4.0|Too much of the opening chapters deal with Mr Luttrell's SEAL training experiences and I was interested in the incident in Afghanistan.  Still a very good read.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Downloaded on my Kindle Fire HDX. Game plays smoothly. I have enjoyed playing this game and have had no problems (other than operator malfunctions!)
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Fun game with a lot of quest. Able to earn and trade earnings to compete quest. Great graphics on kindle fire HD
B004132HZS|5.0|They made Sherlock relevant and engaging, while still staying true to the original materials - with a bunch of great modern twists. Brilliant acting all around!  Sorry, but the American version pales greatly by comparison - for story quality,  engagement, and characterization.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|Excellent video and audio quality.  No sparkly or glowing vampires here.  These guys will kill you and dance on your bones. Classic 80's movie.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This is the third book of the Divergent series and its conclusion. This time, we read two points of view which are narrated by the main characters, Tris & Tobias. The rebellion by the factionless was successful and the factions are disbanded. Tris and Tobias decided to get out of the city and into the unknown. What they found and the truth they learned is both complex and horrifying. This story narrates how they coped in the new world and the hard decisions they had to make.<br /><br />I'm rating this as 3 because of its shock factor even if the conversations dragged in some areas. I didn't quite expect the ending and I think that was a ballsy move by the author. You'll either hate this or be amazed by it. I'm more on the amazed, surprised & befuddled side since it's the first YA sci-fi book I've read that shocked me to the core. I may have shed a tear or two. Sniff**
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent storytelling and depth of characters. Action it is not, but for engaging, excellent story - it is very impressive.
0307938905|5.0|I really enjoy the book.<br />I found the initial part where the one father<br />teaches the daughter hard to stomach.<br />but once I got past that the rest of the story<br />was incredible. Oh to be able to make a room<br />out of wishes. ...<br />I look forward to seeing what else<br />Erin Morgenstern will write.<br />her short stories on the web site are very nice<br />if you go looking for it.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I am a Star Trek van of several of its series and from decades back, but Dr Who is the most clever sci-fi series I have ever watched.
0062183613|5.0|Dan Ariely is wonderfully clear and always interesting. (He's also a terrific speaker, if you get the chance to see him as I did at a conference earlier this year.) I recommend this highly, whether you want to learn some things that will make you see everyday events through fresh eyes, or just want a book to relax with on a plane.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Absolutely Baldacci's best K&M novel.<br />I read it continuously. It never slowed down, never predictable, the great chemistry between the partners was really fun.Enjoy.
0345535529|5.0|Purchased this as a gift not knowing what to expect from a &#34;mass-market&#34; boxed set, but am extremely pleased with the quality of the books. This set will be loved.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this app because you can use your brain a lot. people can really learn a lot about it. anyone can play this game.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Always wait for the extended version of LotR or Hobbit. Much much better. That's all. it says I need 5 more...done.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I just don't understand how one of my favourite book series could end with one of my least favourite books of all time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use the Kindle for my cell phone when I forget my Kindle at home.  It does the same as the Kindle, but I try not to forget my Kindle.  I don't mind the Kindle app for my cell phone, but prefer to have my Kindle. :)
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|First off, this is a very good movie; overall I have to say I like the original trilogy (which I also own) better than this Hollywood version but I find a lot to like about this version also. The reason for 1 star is because this product (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet Digital Copy) was delivered with a Blu-ray, a second disc, &#34;Supplements&#34;, and a Sony DVD-R re-writable with 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' scribbled on the surface with a black Sharpie marker. THIS IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION FROM AMAZON FOR WHY THEY THINK IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO SELL THIS RIP-OFF!!!<br /><br />After finding this, I went back and read other buyers reviews and found that I am not the only one this has happened to; I haven't tried the DVD-R in my player, but those who have report that &#34;Both sound & picture were bad. Very disappointing............&#34;<br /><br />Since when is it acceptable to sell a DVD-R in retail package as being a legitimate product, anyways???<br /><br />DON'T BUY  IT UNTIL THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED!!!
1571200851|5.0|I ordered this book for a friend.  it ordered it last minute but got it in time. great book thanks
B003CSV7TK|4.0|It doesn't have all the scenes, it's been edited.  It seems to be the consensus by many people giving ratings.  It's still good, but I wish it was complete
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|One of his best and that is saying a lot!  The words were blurry but I still couldn't put it down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging. It can also be frustrating because you only get 5 lives and it takes 30 minutes to regenerate  each extra life. That is probably why it is so addicting.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|First book I have read on the culture and history of this region. Lots of sympathetic characters, no real bad guys. Found the book a little hard to follow at times, with the story being told in the past and the present for over a half dozen characters. Really liked it, but still don't see how it is on so many book of the year lists.
0439023491|5.0|The book was in great condition. As a story, I love it as well. There are excellent plot twist and an emotional roller coaster fit for the deepest of readers.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the most astounding book I have read in a long time.  It is emotionally powerful. Brilliantly narrated by Death a family and community deal with the reality of living through the horrors of Nazi Germany and World War11.  The author brilliantly blends the characters together. This reviewer felt the tenderness, love, laughter, sadness, rage and despair. You can not finish reading this book and not be profoundly moved. An excellent book and highly recommended!
B009ZE27US|5.0|fun game. very interesting game I find it enjoyable it is a. wonderful app being that it is free. s
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|SLIGHT SPOILERS<br /><br />Dune came unto being in the year 1965, contemporary with mind altering drugs, the rise of human impact, and a religious feud in the Middle East. Frank Herbert composed a masterpiece of science fiction, creating a world rich in political and ecological detail. Many claim that Dune was of the first sci-fi works that depicted real world problems in a fictional world; prior to Herbert's time authors would construct science fiction mainly for its erratic possibilities. Dune however goes down in time as  a text of numerous implications and lessons, in an attempt to predict the long term effects of human existence. Setting the story on the desert planet Arrakis, Herbert reflects on intelligent modification of an entire ecosystem (the characters wish to bring abundant life to Arrakis) and the impacts it can have on preexisting and future organisms. This is done through the creation of native organisms, which are found to be massive sand worms which are killed by water. Water is obviously a key component to most life, and this is where the controversy falls in. The book takes no stance on the issue; it is left to the reader and future generations to come to a conclusion. The drug melange is a mirror to the experimental attitude of the 60's, and Herbert depicts both the pros and cons of this potent tool. He explores the effects of the drug on the mind –increased insight, awareness, and for the main character, superhuman abilities– and also the consequences that go alongside use (addiction). Aside from its addictive properties, the drug causes frequent users to develop monochromatic blue eyes, a position which again is neutral in the novel. Lastly, the political/religious feuds in the contemporary middle east inspired a vivid diction and plot based around religious control and influence. Herbert makes it clear that it is through religious means that the main character Paul reaches his goals; it is also brought into light in the sequels of Dune that this influence has a much broader impact on Hebert’s universe than originally planned.
B00GDAOYTE|5.0|The options and features are amazing. The number of collage options, and custom collage, image filters, backgrounds, text, sticker, along with the aspect ratio for result image(from 2:1 to 1:2) is great.<br />The quality of result is very good, too. Final output size is large enough and the original image quality is well preserved.<br />What I liked most about this app is the text function. It offers tons of fonts and variety of style(like drop shadow, glow, stroke, label, etc) options.<br />Also it offers lots of options to upload to SNS: Facebook, Twitter, Flicker, Tumblr, etc.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Good read. Grisham always keeps you wondering what is going to happen.<br />So easy to read and hard to put down.
B003B02O0A|3.0|This novel ends with much too many questions unanswered. Otherwise it is not bad. I have read his others also.
B00ANAC32U|1.0|Plastic outer trim piece has broken and the case will not stay on the device.  I've seen a few other of theses bumper cases break in the exact same spot.
B00G118LYY|5.0|Toca Boca is one of those companies that seems to grasp what makes an app that kids enjoy, and that parents trust. My son loves playing with the cars, and I love the fact that I don't have to worry about  inappropriate advertising or in-app purchases.
1439107955|4.0|Great read for a layperson, but don't expect a sugar coating.  He starts at the beginning and end with thoughts about the future, and tells it like it is.
B0084B5TK8|1.0|Didn't like the book at all!  My kids kept telling me how good it was so I thought I'd give it a try.  Quit reading about a third of the way into it!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Please, do not read this book unless you want a NEW FAVORITE BOOK!<br />The research that went into the crafting of this book is astonishing.  I was 14 when Kennedy was murdered, and King captures the tone, temper and mood of the times perfectly.  This book is a time machine that makes me wonder if we've really made much progress in the last half century.<br />Read this on different levels, but by all means read it!
B000SEI230|1.0|In the British Television series “Red Dwarf” during an episode after the four main characters watches an old style romantic movie opinions are asked about how great the movie was.  Arnold Rimmer, portrayed by Chris Barrie, makes the statement of, “I thought it was the worst pile of blubbery schoolgirl mush I’ve ever been compelled to endure.  I consider it an insult to my backside to be forced to sit here growing carbuncles through such putrid adolescent slush.”<br /> I could have said that about “A Walk To Remember” by Nicholas Sparks but that would be no different than the other one to two line reviews at Amazon.com by people who are just as annoyed as I was by this book but haven’t the language to truly expand upon their irritation and vexation at this book.<br /> In most fiction stories, the author, though subconsciously, is asking the reader to suspend disbelief.  For some stories this is easy.  Stephen King, for example, the idea that a cemetery can bring the dead back to life is easy to digest because it is how he works and the world that he has set up gives the reader the notion that such events can happen within those pages.<br /> However, in fiction stories like this that have such a fervent grounding in reality and real life where nothing really miraculous happens, there seems to be no asking for suspension of disbelief.  Unless your bar on the miraculous is the idea of a seventeen-year-old boy truly falling in love qualifies which already raises several red flags in cognitive dissonance.  This in itself is the problem with all “teenage romance” stories:  the idea that a teenage boy actually falls in love.  Anyone with any sense in their head, male or female, would know that to a teenage boy “love” is just a word used to con a woman into bed.  That there is no such thing as “love at first sight” there is only “lust at first sight”.<br /> Bringing back the point of suspension of disbelief, in a case like this, one can only hold open the window of disbelief for so long but when it comes up that a teenage boy has fallen in love without lust coming into the picture then the window slams shut and one word comes to mind:  nonsense.<br /> A far more realistic view, if such books based in such reality were to be a little more honest would be to go a lot more into detail about a young man’s lusts about the object of his desires.  But instead, stories like “A Walk To Remember” treat teenage boys as if they have no raging hormones whatsoever.
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Sting is amazing<br />This will be a great musical on Broadway one day<br />Even if you aren't into the theatre it's good music
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|I really enjoyed this read!! It's got a fantastic and original plot, excellent characters and development of their personalities and maintains the reader engaged throughout the entire book. I would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for something lighthearted,intelligent, and different from other books these days. Like another reviewer said, if you know and like Big Bang, the tv show, the main character, Don, is just like Sheldon!! Loved it!!! Read it- you won't be disappointed!
B00C5R7B0I|3.0|I'm giving Dust three stars because I'm halfway through the book and I'm finding it laborious. I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books but I find once Scarpetta left Virginia, Cornwell lost focus and her books became very dark. I used to view Scarpetta as a strong independent woman but now she is filled with the self doubt of an adolescent which is very annoying. This thing between her and Marino has got to stop as it detracts from the story line. If you're a die hard Cornwell fan, you'll read this. If you're new to Cornwell, read the early stuff and leave this to the die hards.
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|This story leaves u guessing for awhile.  I stayed with it to learn the truth.  Isn't that what we who love mysteries read them for?
B000V4NX04|5.0|This was a gripping story.  Very powerful.  The transition from blind power to empathy and then action was very moving.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Superman sure does yell a lot in this movie.  Anyway, it is definitely an entertaining film, with some nice nods to the Superman canon.  A few surprises, especially what happens to Zod.  In all, worth the price for the rental.  Could become a really strong series.  Plus, lots of things blew up, which accounts for at least one of my four stars! Enjoy it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google Chromecast is super easy to install. I have a Samsung S3 and everything went smooth. It only works with Pandora, HBO, HULU, Netflixs, and the marketplace would like to see it gain acceptance with other apps, but I purchased it for Netflix as my TV isn’t internet capable and this was a cost effective solution. It works fast even with DSL and controls everything from your phone.
B00BATG18K|5.0|Amy Tan doesn't disappoint. Interesting story and I love getting lost in a story and Valley is a tale to get lost in.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and the series it was really awesome and I am happy with the way it turned out in the end
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great quality family movie!  Tom Hanks and the other actors voices are great.  Wonderful Animation.  Perfect to watch with the family.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I got caught up in the &#34;hype&#34; of 50 Shades but it wasn't erotic to me, it was teenage silly and the story was dumb and I got rid of it shortly after starting it. If this type of junk gets women to read, well I guess that's something positive and therefore I gave it one star, but it's basically trash and unbelievable on any level. It was fun to discuss with my friends and the marketing and PR surrounding this trilogy was commendable. Really thought I was going to read something well written and &#34;hot&#34; at the same time. Not so.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|Besides shallow acting... this is entertainment--a movie of kids killing kids?<br />about as much sense as a Kanye West vid
B004Q7CIFI|1.0|I might give it higher if I could actually read it on my Surface, but for some reason that is the only device not allowed. Oversight? Sloppiness? Take your pick, either way it is pain.
B00GNK18X4|5.0|One Direction are not just pop and rock icons, they are very creative and distinctive vocalists. The tunes on this CD vary in genre and musical approaches. The good dance tunes are here along with new variations on classic rock. One Direction's band is superb!  As always, the production techniques are excellent!!!
B00G3Q6VPS|1.0|I was waiting for this album but after hearing all the tracks all that I can say is crap!!!<br />I love only two songs, the rest are waste of money and time<br />Please don't buy it, first listen to it<br /><br />PD: Love Britney, she has several good songs, but this time, and don't get me wrong, are really bad
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good action movie<br />Has a great opener scene but you should have watched the first RED movie to get the best laughs.<br />The characters continue their roles that were started in the first RED
B00G722X9Q|5.0|The songs on this album include great dance tunes and some beautiful ballads. The vocals, the arrangements, and the production techniques enhance each of the songs. The Wanted has another mega hit CD with really terrific cuts!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Best game for bronies  it's got doctor whooves derpy and Octavia annd cm pon 3 rainbow dash and daring do so no more I need to say
B000002V07|5.0|I love Mazzy Star, I don't think she has ever done a song I didn't like. this did not fail me. would recommend it strongly.
030789701X|5.0|This guide certainly qualifies as a tome.  It is as detailed as only a Prima guide can be.  It is beautifully illustrated and extensively indexed.  The maps are clear and understandable and even &#34;unnamed&#34; locations appear.
0142004413|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  It draws you in and you feel as if you are right there.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|love this show.  But this season was a bit slow.  Looking forward to them hopefully going back to great story lines like in Season 1 & 2
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Can this show get any better? It never seems to miss a beat or waste a minute of our time or theirs. Absolutely excellent!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game ever need to get Yolo swag best game EVER SINCE THE BEGINNING of the new age I love it
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Since remastered- sound is better than ever!  This is the first and best collection of music Boston ever recorded hands down!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|She is just good! Contrasting Boris and Theo and yet making them friends is masterful. She also has ability to be of an age. Her discription of life in Vegas sounds like she is a teenager getting down with the boys. Long but worth the journey.
0385537131|5.0|I enjoy reading John Grisham books. This was another good one. It was hard to put down and I loved the ending.
1250038820|3.0|I bought this book because I am a New Yorker.  I was expecting to see a lot of the New York that I am used to.  This is a great book, really.  But it does not contain the type of photos that I was expecting to see.  I would say this is a &#34;Humans of Manhattan&#34; book, while I was expecting a book of photos of people of all the boroughs, IN the boroughs.  Like I would have loved to have seen some photos of people IN Bedford Stuyvesant (I forget its new name! :)), Brownsville, Jamaica, Queens, Bronx, etc.  But again, it is a pretty good book.
